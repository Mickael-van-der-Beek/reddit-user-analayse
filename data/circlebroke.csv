*There are some overlap in these reasons, but I've tried to break them into sections to make them a little less unwieldy.* **Warning:** *massive wall of hyper-opinionated text below*

----

**REASON #0**  
*I don't hate reddit*  

The title of this post is an imagined quote, although I'm reasonably sure I could find a verbatim example. I figured I should edit this in at the beginning to point out that I don't actually *hate* Reddit; I've just been accused of hating it, as a user/mod of both /r/circlebroke and /r/circlejerk.

----

**REASON #1**  
*This website is a tool for building communities, not a community in and of itself*

This website isn't a community any more than Facebook is a community. This website is a tool for sharing information. It contains communities, but what does that matter? You could say the same for Facebook, and I don't see people creating secret Facebook-user hand signals or putting FB logos all over their cars (or, worse, their bodies). Reddit is simply a tool for building communities within the website. This does *not* include the default subreddits, which are much too large to be considered communities. Anyone who makes an account—which is very easy—is automatically subscribed to those subreddits. This does not foster a sense of community; it fosters a sense of ""oh-shit-I've-been-thrown-into-these-subreddits-what-the-fuck-is-going-on?"".

The true communities on Reddit are non-default subreddits. When a user finds a subreddit organically, digests the content already there, and then integrates into the subreddit, *that* is what fosters a sense of community. Being automatically subscribed to a subreddit with 2,000,000+ users does not really qualify as a community, unless you would also be willing to apply that term to a third of the states in the U.S.

I believe that many users think the admins foster make Reddit a community because of the website itself occasionally taking political stances which align with those of a lot of the users—SOPA/PIPA opposition, for example—but Reddit isn't really taking a political stance, it's making a no-brainer financial decision. Bills like those pose a serious danger to websites like Reddit and its ability to make money from content it doesn't own, so it only makes sense that Reddit would oppose such legislation. Earlier in Reddit's history, the argument could possibly be made that the admins were a part of the community and helped shape the direction of the website, but at this point in time, and at this size, it just doesn't hold true anymore. Plenty of them are involved in the community in an unofficial capacity, but they are more reserved when speaking with their red [A]. *(side note: if the admins were attempting to foster a sense of community earlier in its history, I wonder what kind of community they were aiming for, what with their tolerance of subreddits like /r/jailbait and all.)*

I see people pointing to fundraising conducted within Reddit. The Reddit Wikipedia article's section on ""community and culture"" focuses largely on donation drives. Community fundraising efforts are usually just that: isolated to an individual community on the website. They are not site-wide, and a majority of users do not donate. Examples of charitable giving by individual redditors or communities inside of Reddit does not make Reddit itself a solitary community. It is a tool for building communities, and Reddit has even recently introduced tools to allow communities to more easily raise funds. I'm not bashing this fundraising, and I have no doubt that it's a positive thing—I was involved with the /r/ColbertRally fundraising for DonorsChoose.org—but it doesn't reflect on the entire website's user-base. It reflects on individual users and maybe on certain subreddits as a whole, but it is not a reflection of the website itself.

So Reddit isn't a community; it's a tool. It's a tool for building communities centered around a common interest. Maybe the topic is one as vague as /r/music; maybe as specific as /r/thedoors. It is not a perfect tool, but I think it is one of the best community-building tools available. A few of the things that set it apart from other similar tools: the comment nesting and comment/link sorting works well; it is easily accessible with a low barrier-to-entry; it allows users to easily build their own communities, in the form of subreddits, and it grants those moderators a lot of autonomy, including the ability to modify the design of the subreddit; the website administrators are reasonably accessible (especially by comparison to other similar sites); the large pool of users increases the odds of interesting information being shared; comprehensive (if at times not-well-thought-out) moderation tools; and, yo dawg, you can even add tools to your tools: [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com) 

----

**REASON #2**    
*I like many of the things that are popular on Reddit*

…but some redditors are making me hate these things. I'm an atheist. I'm a liberal. I like science. I like puns. I like memes. I enjoy using marijuana. I thought Firefly was a great show. I think Louis CK is the funniest comedian alive, and I like to watch Carl Sagan's COSMOS series or hear Neil deGrasse Tyson give an impassioned speech about the importance of science education. Many of you know I made the ""So Brave"" video for /r/circlejerk, and I had to sit through hours upon hours of NDT and Sagan footage. I enjoyed it, especially compared to how bored I was by the Ron Paul videos I had to endure (sorry Paul fans). I watch The Daily Show pretty often and I occasionally think Jon Stewart's commentary has more substance than the 'serious' media.

I get called a concern troll but if you go through my history, you don't have to venture far to see the two years I spent being a part of the hivemind. Calling all Republicans retarded, mocking religious people, making a shitty racist or misogynistic joke; I even started the massive spamming of the VOTE YES ON PROP 19 poster after Condé Nast refused to let Reddit run an ad in support of the proposition. That's either 3+ years of me telling the truth about my tastes, or I'm one goddamned dedicated concern troll. And while I may have been simultaneously poking fun at these things in /r/circlejerk, I'm still embarrassed at how oblivious I was.

Point being: a lot of my personal tastes overlap with those we in the Complainpire routinely attribute to the Reddit hivemind. I like to get new information about the things that interest me, and Reddit is a useful tool for doing that. The problem arises when the various communities beat each of these things into the ground, and turn adulation into worship, and make disagreement a sin punishable by mass downvoting, used so often on Reddit as a form of censorship-by-committee (and don't get too hoity-toity, Circlebroke, you're as guilty of it as anyone). Content related to these topics lacks depth because depth is not rewarded inside of these communities. A lengthy religious debate in /r/atheism will lose out to text-over-an-image every time. An analysis of the pros and cons of a conservative political viewpoint will never beat out a lazy insult.

Eventually, I just have to get fed up with seeing the people I agree with behaving like children. I can't tell you how many times I've almost left because I'm simply embarrassed that ""my side"" is acting like the ""other side."" I think part of the reason I stick around is that I hold out hope for the website, and I honestly believe that a majority of the website's users are completely capable of having a nuanced discussion about a topic they love (or despise). Maybe the atmosphere created by other users (a problem each user contributes to); maybe it is the way Reddit encourages users to consume as much content as possible very little time; maybe I'm just wrong to hold out hope that a large number of people can behave when no one is holding their feet to the fire.

----

**REASON #3**  
*I like meta discussion, bullshit social commentary, and complaining*

A lot of the regulars in CB can be found haunting the other meta subreddits, like /r/TheoryOfReddit or /r/SubredditDrama (and obviously /r/circlejerk). We like talking about Reddit, examining how users interact, and making sweeping generalizations about the culture of Reddit. That last one is sometimes a problem, as I have seen CB users accused of making sweeping generalizations about redditors—which does happen—but it is a necessary part of trying to discuss Reddit as a whole. We're not doing systems theory, here, and people will just have to trust that we realize that *not every redditor* behaves the same way; at least I know I do. Otherwise, where would the other CB users come from?

I guess I secretly wish I had been a sociology major, because I like having armchair discussions about human interaction. Reddit serves as a sort of proxy for me to offer opinion on (look up sociology). The interactions of users (or groups of users) is more limited and quantifiable than real world interactions, and it's only a website, so no one *should* take the commentary too seriously. I mean, c'mon, CB is a direct spin-off of /r/circlejerk; who's taking that seriously?

It's too hot. It's too cold. I have a headache. This Mountain Dew is flat. These Cool Ranch Doritos are stale. My dogs are annoying. My lawn mower doesn't work right now. I'm a whiner. I like to complain. Other people do, too, and we sometimes even like hearing each others' complaints. If we didn't, CB wouldn't thrive, and neither would half the subreddits on this website. Hell, I think the rest of the website spends as much time complaining as we do. The only reason I've written this entire post is because people were complaining about CB users not ""liking"" Reddit.

----

**REASON #4**  
*Because some of the reasons Reddit sucks are why Reddit is good*

Chief among these reasons is the large userbase. As the user-base of the website grows, so does the amount of knowledge that can be drawn from it. Reddit functions brilliantly as a tool for mining good content from that user-base. The comment and sorting system excel at finding relevant information (subreddits), getting relevant material to the top (through submission sorting and comment voting), and making it easy to add to that material and make it visible (ability to edit posts/comments, and nested comment replies with voting).

Unfortunately, if the user-base is skewed toward low-effort content—as is the case in a lot of the default subreddits—you're not getting the best of the best. Too often, you're getting the worst of the worst. Knowledge isn't the only thing that increases as a population grows. The larger the pool, the more assholes and morons are going to be posting and commenting, and the more they are going to be upvoting worthless—and in some cases, hateful—content.

Before I landed on Reddit, I'd never seen such a large congregation of liberals, atheists, and people interested in science and technology. That's what lured me here. But it's also what has led me to hate a lot of the people who represent viewpoints I agree with. The very reason I came to the website is the very reason I've contemplated leaving in the past: you can't just enjoy something on Reddit, you have to be willing to defend the thing you enjoy at all costs, including complete rejection of any detractors.

So with every positive thing about Reddit, there comes a negative. In an earlier section, I praised Reddit's lack of admin interference with subreddits. I wouldn't have it any other way, but that means that /r/jailbait remained available for years and /r/atheism isn't moderated at all.

----

**REASON #5**  
*Because it's not your website*

If you have ever told another Reddit user to just leave Reddit (not even a particular subreddit, but the website itself): what is wrong with you? Just because your asshole comment got upvoted 4 times by /r/atheism or /r/politics or /r/trees subscribers does not make you right. One thousand upvotes will not make you right. Thinking you're an expert on who constitutes a 'good Reddit user' doesn't make you an expert, and being upvoted by a thousand non-experts doesn't give you any [additional qualifications](http://i.imgur.com/JV1lW.jpg). One of the reasons we try so hard to discourage downvoting and participation in linked threads is that it accomplishes nothing. Why even waste the effort when it just makes CB users look petty?

Users with the ""love it or leave it"" attitude should be reminded that they do not speak for the website or its users; only the admins speak for the website. Users are able to speak for the subreddits—the communities—they moderate, but never for the website as a whole. There is a diversity of opinion here, whether the hivemind likes it or not, and as the site grows, those opinions are going to grow more diverse and the voices behind them will grow louder. Get used to it.

If I do not like a certain subreddit and I voice my opinion within that subreddit, the moderatos there are free to ban me. I may ask them why, but I won't be a bother after it happens. ""Love it or leave it"" can certainly be applied to an individual subreddit, when it's a moderator saying it.

But all too often, users are just told to ""leave"" Reddit, that their opinions aren't welcome, and that they'd be better off on some other website. The fact is that anyone who displays that level of intolerance to difference of opinion is an asshole and deserves to be called out on it.

If nothing else, I'll stay on this website just to annoy those users. It's fun.

----
----
----

I'll be completely serious for a moment: the main reason I come to Reddit is that I still manage to get more joy than headache from visiting and interacting on the website. As long as that remains the case, I'm going to continue to visit the site regularly. It is a good tool and I will try to find good ways to put it to use. Sure, I can get burned out on it from time to time, but that's true of any hobby.

In a similar vein, we all love to generalize on Reddit, particularly here in the great subreddit in the sky that is Circlebroke. It's just easier, and it's often difficult to make your point without generalizing at least to some degree.  
  
Now, before you go thinking this is just another SRS-lite post, think again my fellow Republikkan skytards. Herein, we will examine popular generalizations on Reddit from both sides, so as to give the appearance of objectivity and also make sure we make fun of everyone all at once. This way, no one can possibly get angry or defensive (LOL). So without further ado, I'd like to present:

We all have little things that keep bringing up back to reddit, despite its tendency to confound or annoy or infuriate us.  It might be a niche interest, a small community that can’t be replicated elsewhere, or a Sisyphean determination to wade through the defaults for the occasional nugget of insight. 

For me, it’s been a longstanding fascination with what makes the hivemind tick.  I may even be the most determined comment-miner on the site - when I see a comment of unusual bravery, I’ll often spend ages digging through their history just to figure out [just what kind of person they are](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/w6m5m/circlebroke_i_challenge_you_to_find_a_more/).  I’ve long found that the hivemind of reddit presents an endlessly fascinating specimen, most particularly due to its ability to proudly maintain a host of bewildering quirks:

* Proudly leftist and staunchly pro gay rights, but cruelly dismissive any issues affecting women or minorities

* Priding itself on being attentive to propaganda, and yet eager to make a cause celebre out of someone like Kim Dotcom, whose self promotion can only be described as [propaganda of the crudest kind](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MokNvbiRqCM&amp;feature=player_embedded).

* Insisting that Gawker links be banned in the name of free speech

* Furiously waving the flag for Palestinian independence while flippantly rejecting Tibet

* Continuing to repeat a joke at length, far beyond the point at which anyone could possibly find it funny 

Years of carefully studying the hive (I’ll bump up against my fourth anniversary soon) have led me to believe that the quirks which animate its peculiar psychology can be broken down to a number of core concepts, and that once you add these concepts to your toolkit the otherwise inexplicable whims or the hive start to make a great deal more sense.  If you’ll follow me, what follows is an attempt to collect these core concepts, most of which have hitherto been bandied about in various comments and threads, and organize them into a singe integrated document.

**THE CIRCLEJERK**

Far and away, the most striking and characteristic aspect of the hivemind - perhaps even its definitive trait - is the circlejerk.  Now, in one sense, the tendency to circlejerk is not itself a terribly unusual tendency, as any group of people sharing an enthusiastic agreement will inevitably tend towards smug in group congratulation.  What makes reddit’s circlejerking so strange, however, is how whimsical the topics seem to be.  Any casual visitor to reddit is well-versed with its obsession with a strange set of narrow, peculiar interests.  The good folks at circlebroke have documented circlejerks over how [Osama bin Laden wasn’t such a bad guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/wdnvr/good_guy_osama_bin_laden/), [two dollar bills](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yfgxx/an_ehipster_and_his_legal_tender/), [swastikas](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/134zvz/the_swastika_has_nothing_to_do_with_nazis_now/), [North Korean propaganda](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/wjuf3/reddit_upvotes_obviously_fake_north_korean/), and a host of other topics.  Why such a fixation on such peculiar issues?

**SECOND OPTION BIAS**

The seminal post on this topic was made by /u/douglasmacarthur, in which [he coined the term] (http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yngzi/reddits_strange_affinity_for_socialism_how/c5x6adc) **""second option bias.""**  In a nutshell, second option bias refers to the tendency of the typical hiver to tack to the opposite of whatever happens to be a commonly accepted view in his milieu without undertaking any sort of serious or good-faith analysis of the strengths in that position.  Second-option bias is such a widely prevalent phenomenon among certain demographics that I was struck to see /u/Cenodoxus describing [nearly the identical phenomenon in remarkably similar language here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/12zp30/what_work_has_done_the_most_damage_to_your_field/c6zmzih), when discussing the dangers of taking revisionist history too seriously.

**SNOWFLAKING**

But why would second option bias come to be such a defining characteristic of the community?  It is clearly identifiable as a trend, but what motivates it?  For a deeper read on the psychological needs which animate the typical hiver you may want to read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebrokediscussion/comments/11c6z9/what_is_your_vision_of_the_typical_redditor/c6li3yr), but it may be sufficient for now to introduce the concept of **snowflaking.**  Snowflaking describes the need of certain people to aggressively promote their individuality by insisting upon various ideas, tastes and practices that are intended to separate them from the crowd.  Snowflaking is, of course, not unique to reddit, but it conspicuously manifests itself in various forms:

* The way every thread on music inevitably turns into a “can you name a more obscure artist” contest

* The insistence on belonging to an unfairly persecuted class of people

* The loud rejection of every identifiable aspect of American culture, no matter how petty or obscure

* The proud ignorance of celebrities (see also:  [Alpha Nerding](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2670))

**JERK ALPHA**

The king of all jerks, however, the sun around which jerks revolve, is clearly the “I am a misunderstood genius” jerk.  Because this is the jerk which spawns and influences nearly every other jerk the hiveosphere, I refer to it as **Jerk Alpha**.  It is the combination of Jerk Alpha and snowflaking that that yields second-option bias, and its infamous connections with bravery.  You see, it is not quite enough to be a misunderstood genius, the opinions the hiver holds must also be dangerous and unconventional.  For a typical example of these factors all playing out in real time, I refer you to the [reactions the movie Avatar garnered](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ah43h/reddit_what_did_you_think_of_avatar/) when it [first came out](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/agbba/sure_avatar_is_pocahontas_in_space_and_a_sequel/), compared to the reactions the movie typically gets now that it has become the most successful movie ever - a steady progression from a generally positive but nuanced take to OMG WORST MOVIE EVER.

**THE EMPATHY DEFICIT**

However, this does not quite manage to account for some other notable quirks in the hive, such as the aforementioned contrast between its affinity for gay rights and its disdain for women and minorities.  To explain this, we have to examine the peculiar role that **the empathy deficit** plays in the behavior of the hive.  We all remember that the hive erupted in outrage - and rightly so - at the awful bullying behavior of those middle schoolers to that older lady on the bus, right?  It’s interesting to compare that to the hive’s reaction when a bunch of internet porn viewers start bullying a cam girl – all of a sudden [everything is the girl’s fault](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/xxvs4/i_think_this_linkthread_captures_the_essence_of/).  

What’s going on here?  Note how many of these reactions are determined by who the hive happens to identify with more.  Your average hiveminder has very little understanding of what it's like to be black or a woman, or to suffer the kind of discrimination blacks and women are sadly familiar with. But what about your average young gay male? Well, he's probably a little scrawny, probably has some tics that make him noticeably unusual, probably has unusual interests, probably gets picked on. Your average hiver gets this. Hell, your average hiver probably was picked on for being gay, even if he wasn't. He knows what it's like to be mocked for this and it hurts.

Now, what about the old lady getting picked on in the bus? Well, which side do you think your typically redditor was on in school - the jeering, bullying crowd or the tearful recipient?  But when the bullying crowd is a group of anonymous keyboard warriors saying dickish things over the internet, how interesting that we suddenly have a whole new set of sympathies.

[A lack of empathy is, of course, one of the most noted features of those on the techie side of things.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome).   As a result, the average hiver places maximum priority upon issues with which he can empathize, while disregarding those which involve an unfamiliar form of experience.  The best example of this can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/127bll/truegaming_black_guy_rants_about_what_its_like_to/c6swdc9?context=3), though I also refer you to:

* Jokes about raping men, particularly prison rape, are inevitably met with frowning tut-tuts of how that's not funny.  Jokes about raping [male children](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/yfgcu/really_how_do_you_let_this_headline_through/c5v3ul9), however, are hilarious.

* Girls walking around in public should have little expectation of privacy, and yet Gawker's invasion of violentacrez's privacy results in [sitewide condemnation](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/10/redditors-stand-gawker-protect-child-pornography/57850/).

* An abiding concern that [women are out to get us](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/10vrkd/a_til_post_about_ladies_night_being_banned_brings/).

Note how the only thing which seems to unify these disparate reactions is whoever the hiver tends to immediately identify with most.

Now, the assertion that the hivemind struggles with empathy might seem a bit confusing, even controversial, given the hive’s affinity for leftist politics.  Personally, however, I found that comparing [the hive’s relative reaction to Palestine (most important issue!) and Tibet (omg shut up already!) to be quite telling](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/14of45/if_you_need_any_further_proof_of_the_hollow/), suggesting that what animates the hive is less compassion than the opportunity to take an “unpopular” opinion.  Once again, the prime movers are snowflaking and second-option bias, not bone-bred political convictions.

There is even, I think, a telling shallowness in the embrace of gay rights and a lesson in the limits of empathy which is revealed by the hive’s embrace of the epithet “faggot.”  Being general champions of gay rights, one might expect the hive to reject such terms and their hurtful etymology.  Note, however, that there’s no “second option” in this case, no in-law or journalist to contradict.  No one, not even Republicans, argue in favor of the usage of “faggot,” and as a result there is no one to bravely disagree with.  Furthermore, because of its quasi-meme status, the hiver associates people saying “OP is a fag” with people like him.  The empathy for a gay individual hurt by the normalization of this slur is overridden by empathy towards someone even more like him than a homosexual.  Again, what appears to be the moving piece here is that the hiver's compassion runs out as soon as his empathy does, particularly when there is no second-option to bravely brave against.  

**CONTENT VS. COMMUNITY**

But what about other quirks, such as the tendency to repeat jokes and memes until they are well and thoroughly beaten into the ground?  Moreover, why do such tendencies persist despite such a vocal segment of the community loudly disdaining them?  Here we must distinguish between **content users and community users**.  Content users come to reddit primarily to absorb the information that is produced, whether in jokes, news or serious minded discussion.  The value of the information is limited to its single use absorption.  Community users, on the other hand, are attracted not just by the raw value of the content but also by the need to connect and integrate with what they take to be a community of friends and pseudo-friends.  Community users will repeat a meme far beyond the point at which its inherent comical value has been bled dry because it functions as a symbol of in-group coherence - think of it as like a digital high-five amongst a cohort of people “in the know.”  This is why in-jokes maintain a life far beyond the value of the original joke, as it functions as a reminder of the group’s unique social cohesion.  This is also why content users roll their eyes with utter incredulity as yet another chain of beaten-down references - the joke has long since lost its inherent comic value, but community users are still banding it around because they are extracting a value from it which content users either don’t want or don’t need.

**CASUAL VS COMMITTED**

The final set of concepts necessary to explicate reddit’s behavior is to understand the distinction between **casual users and committed users.**  This distinction is rather more trivial than the others, and should be readily evident to anyone who has glanced into a highly upvoted thread in which all the commenters are baffled by its popularity, but I think it is worth lingering on in order to unpack a few of its implications.  Given the peculiarities of reddit's [alogorithm and its accompanying “fluff principle""](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vqy9y/dear_circlebrokers_what_changes_would_you_make_to/c56x55f), reddit clearly caters to casual users, and from a business perspective this makes a certain amount of sense since unique visitors power a website’s cachet.  However, there is a certain danger in this, as the more bland and watered-down the experience becomes, the more it becomes indistinguishable from others, the easier it is to abandon.  The casual users who are driving certain trends in the quality of content are also liable to the be most likely to move onto the next thing.  Despite everything I’ve written here, I am very much a big fan of reddit at its best, and what reddit can manage to be, but without a robust understanding of the fundamental dynamics at play - what makes them strong, what makes it weak - it runs the risk of being just another thing.

It should be no secret to any long time redditor that the reddit community has a tendency to fixate on certain topics to the point of gleeful, euphoric agreement, often accompanied by a vicious intolerance for disagreement.  The puzzle, however, comes with the strange diversity of obsessions - why be so progressive on subjects such as gay marriage and yet veer close to outright prejudice on issues of race and gender?  Why loudly trumpet the cause of Palestine and yet express bored disinterest to the analogous situation in Tibet?  What does any of this have to do with Mother Teresa?  Or tipping?  Or creepshots?

When presented with such a bewildering kalidescope of obsessions, it’s easy to wave it all away with the commonly heard refrain that “reddit is not just one person.”  As a long time watcher of the hive, however, I’m convinced that a vast amount of these peculiar quirks can actually be explained by a few simple rules of thumb - tendencies which characterize the average redditor, and which color the shared outlook into a series of odd, but predictable convictions.  Back at the beginning of the year [I wrote a lengthy post introducing some of these concepts](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/15s60l/anatomy_of_a_circlejerk_or_a_grand_unified_theory/), now I’d like to return to that discussion in order to revise it a bit and, more importantly, to demonstrate how they can be applied in order to unify the perplexing variety of obsessions.

**It’s my contention that around 90% of the circlejerks on reddit derive from four simple principles - one single Jerk Prime, and three individual Alpha Jerks.**

* **Jerk Prime - I am a misunderstood genius.**

The ""misunderstood genius"" jerk holds pride of place because it acts not only as the progenitor of its own minor jerks (_social conventions are beneath me_), but also as the glue and justification which holds all other jerks together.  The average redditor takes pride in peculiar obsessions - these are not evidence of a blinkered perspective shaded by several forms of bias, but rather _prima facia_ evidence of misunderstood genius.  In other words, they are both the product of a need to feel like a misunderstood genius, and then, once produced, taken as evidence that they were a misunderstood genius all along.   Certainly, all of the jerks are snowflaking of one degree or another, but Jerk Prime is no doubt the most treasured, most beloved snowfalking of all.

The purest distillation of this jerk is most visible in the recurring [I’m too smart for school and that’s why I failed](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1dqoh9/raskreddit_and_its_untapped_geniuses_explain_how/) posts, but you’d be hard pressed to find any recurring obsession which does not in some way rely on the redditor’s outsized confidence in their rarified reasoning abilities.

**The Alpha Jerks**

* **SELECTIVE EMPATHY**

* **Rule of thumb - In any given dispute, the person most similar to the average redditor will be the one deemed correct.**

As I wrote in [my prior post](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/15s60l/anatomy_of_a_circlejerk_or_a_grand_unified_theory/), the role of Selective Empathy becomes most apparent when comparing reddit’s reaction to the older woman bullied on the bus by middle schoolers, and a cam girl bullied on her channel by internet porn viewers.  The old woman was (at least initially) showered with sympathy and funds, [while according to reddit the disaster on the cam channel was all the girl’s fault.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/xxvs4/i_think_this_linkthread_captures_the_essence_of/)

Why the differing reactions?  Well, let’s apply our rule of thumb.  In the case of the bus lady, who is the redditor most similar to?  The bullying middle schoolers, tossing out jibes and insults?  Not them, so the bullying recepient is held to be correct.  In the case of the cam girl, however, suddenly the bulliers are keyboard warriors, tossing out cruel insults from behind a veil of anonymity.  Strikingly similar situations, but suddenly the recpient is in the wrong.

Let’s apply this to a few more situations:

* **Gay marriage**:

| Antagonists   | Sympathy         |
|:-----------|------------:
| Loud, older Christian fundamentalists.      |          |    
| Socially abnormal targets of bullying and ridicule  |    Definitely Correct|    

* **Race**:

| Antagonists   | Sympathy         |
|:-----------|------------:
| Average black male. |          |    
| Average white male.  |    Definitely Correct|

* **Gender**

| Antagonists   | Sympathy         |
|:-----------|------------:
| Average white male. |        Definitely Correct  |    
| Average white female.  |    |    

* **Any situation involving children.**

| Antagonists   | Sympathy         |
|:-----------|------------:
| Child. |         |    
| Average adult nearby.  | Definitely Correct   |   

* **Usage of ""Op is a Fag""**

| Antagonists   | Sympathy         |
|:-----------|------------:
| Socially abnormal targets of bullying and ridicule. |         |    
| Edgy internet forum dwellers.  | Definitely Correct   |

Now let’s make things a bit more subtle.  Remember the violentacrez controversy?  How fascinating was it that the same community which decried the invasion of violentacrez’s privacy was comparatively silent at the fact that [what got violentacrez into trouble in the first place was invading other people’s privacy?](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2012/10/redditors-stand-gawker-protect-child-pornography/57850/)  Again let’s apply Selective Empathy.  On the one hand we have anonymous attractive females wandering around in public, and on the other an awkward internet pornographer, and a noted redditor no less.  [Little surprise that the hive chose to overlook the irony.]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/11aiuy/when_youre_a_woman_or_a_young_girl_in_public/)

Notice how Selective Empathy plays out in the following scenarios:

* A rowdy crowd of men gropes a woman.  [She should have known better than to be a crowd of rowdy men.](
http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/14y1nx/girl_lifts_her_top_up_in_crowd_only_to_be_groped/c7hlsq0)

* Jokes about raping men and the trivialization of male rape are commonly complained about.  [Jokes about raping children are hilarious.](
http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/yfgcu/really_how_do_you_let_this_headline_through/c5v3ul9)

* [Guy rudely pushes woman out of the way of his photo](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1gj9fb/how_i_deal_with_random_photobombers/).  Compare to how reddit would have reacted if it had been a frat boy pushing some nerd out of the way and then braying with laughter about it.

* [Woman reacts angrily to boys skateboarding near her home.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/18v8bf/teenagers_trespassing_on_your_yard_not_a_problem/)  Compare the reaction had it been a nerd who was angry at a bunch of teenage girls for getting loud and annoying.

* Even in /r/philosophy, [discrimination against men is a serious, pressing  issue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/167is8/in_the_second_sexism_discrimination_against_men/?limit=500)  I’ve never seen near the same sort of attention being paid to discrimination against women.

It's difficult to discern any sort of _principle_ which unifies the cases above, but an instinct towards being emphatic only towards those most similar to yourself helps to explain a great deal of the peculiarity.  I find it too remarkable to be a coincidence that [a lack of empathy of often noted among those on the techie side of the spectrum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16596080).

* **SECOND-OPTION BIAS** 

* **Rule of thumb - The contradiction to any commonly held position is immediately held to be correct, so long as there is some veneer of plausibility to the argument.**

This phenomenon was first identified in /u/douglasmacarthur's classic [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yngzi/reddits_strange_affinity_for_socialism_how/c5x6adc), and has been analyzed in detail - here I would like to expand a bit on how it appears in practice.

My personal favorite example of second-options bias is the hive’s astonishingly divergent reactions to Palestine and Tibet, summarized [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/14of45/if_you_need_any_further_proof_of_the_hollow/).  However, perhaps the most amusing example is the [demonization of Mother Teresa](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/19upzi/til_mother_teresa_was_a_terrible_human_being_and/) and the rehabilitation of Adolf Hitler (see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tob2o/what_is_something_that_society_finds/c4odkgz) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/141p2f/hitlers_strange_afterlife_in_india_hated_and/c793pqj) and [here](
http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1aclnc/the_only_one_who_isnt_literally_hitler_is/)).

I once came across a comment which summed up the attitude pretty well:  [Just imagine how amazing this world would be if we had a few more Hitlers and a few less Mother Theresas.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1aclnc/the_only_one_who_isnt_literally_hitler_is/c8wfemi)

The most prominent Beta jerk of Second-Option Bias is your:

* **Edgy Hipster Jerk**:

* **Rule of thumb - The best known or most popular version of anything is automatically bad.**

Naturally, this includes popular music (Kesha sucks, Mumford and Sons suck), popular TV shows (Big Bang Theory sucks), Apple (brainwashed), Digg (when it was popular enough to be a threat to reddit), Avatar (despite [praising it before it became popular](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ah43h/reddit_what_did_you_think_of_avatar/)), Thomas Edison, etc. 

Of course, if the theory is that redditors love to bravely brave against popular things, then the elephant in the room in terms of popular things and popular culture is the United States itself.  This leads to another, Beta Jerk, the:

* **Amerikkka Jerk.**

* **Rule of thumb - Every uniquely identifiable aspect of American culture or society is automatically bad.**

Examples of things that suck about America:  [ice cubes]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/dg4h2/goddamn_ice_cubes/c0zzlog), [tooth brushing](http://www.reddit.com/r/answers/comments/kwpjj/do_i_absolutely_have_to_brush_my_teeth_every_day/c2nuyec), [teeth](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/kvr9x/til_that_crooked_teeth_are_considered_cute_in/c2nms63), [courtroom procedure](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kyuzg/reddit_courtroom_amanda_knox_murder_appeal_fate/c2oecwi), [appreciation of heavy metal](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/iz3ai/russian_crowd_during_a_metallica_concert_in_91/c27tgvy), [game buying habits](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ux63z/the_drm_cycle/c4zdswf), and so forth.

For an interesting thought experiment in how second-option bias plays out, compare the relative treatment of Muslims in Israel with Muslims in Europe.  Surely they are not altogether terribly different from one another, but the former is held to be an unfairly maligned paragons of peace, while the latter are savage mongrels trying to drag down Eutopia with their medieval beliefs.  I don’t think this really files under empathy given that Israelis are too unfamiliar to be identified with and Europeans too incandescently perfect, but I think it works pretty well as an example of vulgar contrarianism.  

* **BROGRESSIVISM** 

* **Rule of thumb - Give me everything I want, yet ask of me no sacrifice.**

Reddit’s affinity for social programs should be pretty well established, but the notable twist is that reddit generally balks at any form of sacrifice whatsoever.  Already noted above in the discussion of Selective Empahty is the pearl-clutching whenever affirmative action or race/gender based scholarships come up, all of which run the risk of taking something away from the redditor.  Note also the tendency among European redditors to search for Americans to buy Steam games for them at American prices, circumventing the very taxes which make their social welfare programs possible.

Brogressivism leads to some strangely selective libertarianism.  Although reddit is sometimes noted as a “libertarian” community, its eagerness at the prospect of a complete government takeover of medicine is well-noted, as it would result in more free things for the redditor.  This sits a bit strangely alongside reddit’s libertarian stance towards drugs and guns, save for the fact that reddit simply likes them and wants them.  Note again the role of Selective Empathy here, as the people most likely to be hurt by the ready availibility of guns and drugs are likely to be poor inner-city residents, and therefore unlike the redditors themselves.  Again, libertarian when it comes to gettings things, socialist when it comes to getting things.

The affinity for free things and the aversion to sacrifice extends beyond policy, however.  Note the cavalier attitude towards piracy (arguably a Beta Jerk in and of itself), although also note how the attitude towards “free culture” changes when the empathetic role changes from [faceless corporation](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17c6g4/why_i_wont_be_buying_simcity/c846laa) to [reddit itself](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/fr9b6/the_scumbag_chive/).

Along with a splash of the Amerikkka jerk, the tipping jerk emerges from the same instinct.  Redditors perhaps like to fancy themselves warm and compassionate, but when the opportunity arises to cut a few dollars towards hard-working people the storm clouds immediately gather.  “Make the owners pay for that, not me!” is of a kind with “Make the rich pay for that, not me!,” (ignore the fact that in the former case, the customer would pay the same amount no matter what, the lack of rigor is what reveals it to be more instinct than position). 

**Conclusion**

For the sake of brevity, there are a couple of jerks I didn’t cover and a few which don’t cleanly fit into this rubric (clapping at movies just riles people up for some strange reason).  Still, I’m confident that this approach captures a great deal of the common sentiment as well as some of the more notable and peculiar quirks of the community.

I have only been vaguely following the WikiLeaks story, only recently since my country decided that it was actually going to bother thinking about enforcing that silly European Arrest Warrant thing, mainly because watching everything go absolutely tits-up is interesting. And since that time, I have come upon an opinion which has proved rather unpopular. And that opinion is that Julian Assange is a slimy fuck.

This is a man who is wanted for questioning for rape. Rape is not a minor crime. Rape is a very serious crime. That I should have to fucking state this fact, which should be abundantly obvious to anyone with an ounce of goddamn sanity, is a large part of the problem. He has consistently attempted to avoid being questioned for rape, under the nebulous reasoning that if he is extradited to Sweden for rape offenses, this naturally means that the USA will extradite him further to there so that he can be held indefinitely without trial and tortured. This, incidentally, is not my use of hyperbole; this is actually what the top comment in the /r/worldnews thread about it is suggesting WILL happen if Assange is sent to Sweden:

&gt; [It's extremely comforting for me to know that Assange will not be put to death in the US and will only face indefinite detention without trial and relentless torture. I will sleep better tonight.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/yknz8/sweden_does_not_want_to_extradite_assange_to/c5wflu1)

Where did this poster pull this assertion from? Directly out of his shitter. There is no fucking evidence whatsoever at present that the USA would extradite Assange if he went to Sweden, and precisely fuck all to suggest that he would be tortured. The logical flaws with this idea are innumerate: wouldn't someone notice that Assange had gone and raise hell? How exactly do you ""disappear"" an expert self-publicist like him? DO YOU REALLY THINK THE USA ARE THAT GODDAMN STUPID TO TRY AND TORTURE SOMEONE WHO IS RAPIDLY BECOMING A HOUSEHOLD NAME? ARE YOU ***REALLY*** THAT FUCKING STUPID?

But don't point this out. Because Reddit are sitting in their little circle wanking each other off something good and chronic over this, and you'll only get the results sprayed all over your face in the form of downvotes.

Also don't point out that Assange has done an excellent job of conflating his being extradited to Sweden for rape with the USA not liking him, thus making his struggle to not be questioned for a SERIOUS CRIME WHICH HE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF seem actually like part of a struggle for transparency and democracy and yadda yadda yadda. It's a fucking brilliant bit of PR and misdirection, which seems to be working wonders because everyone is hell bent on ignoring the actual reason Sweden wants to question him and instead making up lurid and often completely nonsensical things that they'll do to him once he gets there.

But what of those who *do* address the actual rape accusations? Who do actually understand what it is Sweden want to ask him about? Surely they might think, well, due process, why won't he go to Sweden and answer the questions and clear his name?

FUCK NO! DISCREDIT HIS ACCUSERS INSTEAD AND PRETEND IT WASN'T RAPE.

It will take a lot of strength for me to not write in all-caps for the rest of this self-post, so please excuse me, again, if my language is a little bit... blunter than I might otherwise prefer.

Reddit's attitude to rape is frankly fucking *obscene*. The concept of privilege, so espoused by SRS, has never been more absolutely proven to be 100% correct by the hordes of pimply fucking neckbeards making jokes about one of the most horrific traumas a woman could go through, and then pretending it's all a bit of harmless fun. If you have an OUNCE OF FUCKING EMPATHY and HUMAN GODDAMN DECENCY you would realise that maybe it isn't the nicest thing, and maybe rape should be treated as a serious matter.

But we're into different territory here. One of Reddit's peculiar complexes is the *false rape allegation*. Reddit is goddamn terrified that some woman, somewhere, is going to accuse them of rape. Every other person who is accused of rape is really innocent and it's just some evil woman who wasn't getting enough attention or wasn't getting bought things or was just crazy, don't stick your dick in crazy amirite guise? And now, with lots of documents from Swedish prosecutors and a Reddit hero being accuse of rape, Reddit can jerk itself to a creamy finish over this.

Every aspect of the case against Assange so far has been picked apart ruthlessly by the hordes of commenters. Every statement, the possible charges against him, the motivations of the women concerned, how the charges came about, all of it has been pored over and analysed and fucked around with by lots of armchair detectives who have all come to the conclusion that Assange is completely innocent because bitches be crazy. And the ones who don't bemoan that he is ""innocent until proven guilty"", which would be fair enough if Assange wasn't the one currently trying to extricate himself from the judicial process.

I'm going to level with you. Rape is under-reported precisely because of attitudes like this. Because women who report that they have been raped have all of this and more happen to them; the statements, the charges, the motivations, the circumstances, gets pored over and analysed and fucked around with much in the same way. On a smaller scale, certainly, but in the same fashion. Rape itself is traumatic; having to go to court and explain how you were raped and what happened, and know that you are being *judged* for what you say almost as much as the person who assaulted you heaps trauma upon trauma. It is an awful process. I do not wish it upon anyone.

And Reddit doesn't help. It takes the over-analysis and the prying and goes wild. Does anyone, at all, think possibly about the two women who reported that Assange raped them? (And these are not trumped up charges - one of them alleged Assange had sex with her *while she was asleep*, which is straight up rape virtually whichever way you put it, and another alleged he held her down and penetrated her, which is... well, what else can it be?) Take them as a case study. Think about how they must feel having everything about a traumatic experience in their lives blown up and dissected around the world by people who have never met them, in newspapers by journalists who don't even know their names. By anonymous commenters on Reddit, hiding behind usernames. ([This Guardian editorial discusses it far more eloquently, and less profanely, than I can.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/19/julian-assange-balcony-defence-editorial?INTCMP=SRCH))

It is this, in microcosm, that keeps rape from being reported. It is the Reddit hivemind mentality of rape accusers being lying bitches by default that keeps rape from being reported. It is these attitudes that cause people to shy away from taking action to put someone who has violated their personal integrity behind bars. Reddit is using them to justify a wanted man skipping bail and hiding away from the judicial process. When they were given examples of actual rapists, actual rapists explaining how they raped people, Reddit minimised their crimes and reassured them that they weren't bad, really.

False rape accusations are rare. Very rare. And you know what? I would rather one innocent fucker gets dragged through a court process by some vindictive bitch whose accusations are taken with the utmost seriousness, than have countless thousands of people who have actually been raped afraid to report their crime because they fear it will be dismissed, or worse blamed upon them for drinking too much, being slutty, whatever the latest justification is these days.

This probably got a bit unfocused. I am ranting a bit. So let me summarise.

The Assange jerk is ridiculous, and is following exactly the sort of path that he himself would like it to go; ignoring what he's actually accused of in favour of conspiracies, lurid conspiracies with either no evidence or the flimsiest evidence available to back them up. Then, when the jerk finally does get round to discussing the accusations, Reddit snaps into its default mode of victim-blaming, rape apology and paranoia about false accusations. This is a harmful culture, it's a goddamn scary thing that this website is full of people willing to not give someone brave enough to come forward about a deeply traumatic crime the benefit of the doubt, and sadly all it does is act as a case study for society's treatment of rape at large.",Quality Post,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,starflair,,True,t3_ylfqk,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/ylfqk/and_so_i_cannot_hold_it_in_any_longer_this_is_the/,

Reddit: the primary vehicle of cultural change.

**DAE WE DID IT REDDIT?**

So many subreddits have been born out of the various calls to arms that inevitably occur within the tempestuous seas of the political subreddits.  AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS REDDIT COULD BE THE GREATEST TOOL OF POLITICAL ADVOCACY EVER?

So the slacktivism birthed multiple subreddits, that eventually became the ""Reddit Activist Network"":  /r/activism, /r/rpa, /r/rpac, /r/testpac, /r/runforit, /r/americanpirateparty, /r/anonymous, /r/changenow, /r/reformstorm, /r/evolutionreddit

We have the WE DID IT!, the WE DIDN'T, and the moot: /r/SOPA, /r/ACTA, /r/CISPA, /r/OperationPullRyan, /r/prop37

And then we have the dead, the dying, and the stillborn: /r/realdemocracynow, /r/tracingmoney, /r/freedomslipping, /r/unspin, /r/osdf (open source democracy foundation), /r/newparty, /r/grahamcracker, /r/projectPM, /r/peoplesparty, /r/Anon_Ops, /r/ows, /r/alloccupy, /r/cRedditUnion, /r/boycotthollywood, /r/waste, /r/opElectronicLeviathan, /r/projectfactcheck, /r/projectoverhaul, /r/rwb (redditors without borders), /r/watchdog, /r/corporations, /r/corporateblacklist, /r/copa (continue online piracy act), /r/nocorporationnovember, /r/problemswithcapitalism, /r/byourvoice, /r/rootstrikers, /r/unitedcitizens, /r/redditpoliticalparty, /r/politicallyaware, /r/zeitgeist

[**IAMA Darrell Issa, AMA about IAMA**, the Internet American Moratorium Act](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/13vtx0/iama_congressman_seeking_your_input_on_a_bill_to/)

But Darrell Issa is a republican.  He is unquestionably an opportunist.  His technical background makes him one of the few elder statesmen with a working knowledge of the issues at hand ([not like you muggles!](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/13vtx0/iama_congressman_seeking_your_input_on_a_bill_to/c77p6ix)).  Issa's proven his prowess with a successful internet-driven fundraising campaign to unseat former California Governor Gray Davis, and he utilizes social media campaigns rather well to maintain public presence.  He has over 60,000 twitter followers and has a social media [Klout score above 80](http://www.fantasypolitics.co/index.php/component/pfprofile/?id=92&amp;controller=single), which is less than Justin Beiber, more than Nickelback, and neck-and-neck with Elizabeth Warren.

&gt; Although I am a very hard worker, I have limited skills, and funds for that matter. I can sew, knit, and run really far really fast. Thats about it. Obviously me coming with either the first or second wave would probably be more of a set back than anything. So my question is, what in the world can I do to help this project get off? I had some ideas about organizing ""care packages"" being sent to the first two waves. Pretty much I'd just like to make myself useful.

We're both long time redditors, and atheists, but created this shared throwaway to conduct this experiment.
 
 
We were wondering just how bad we could make a quote picture, and still have it upvoted by the community. So I present to you, [this image](http://i.imgur.com/UdFsV.jpg).

 
It was posted to the subreddit about 11AM US time, and (at 1 day old) is currently sitting on ~850 upvotes, and at its peak was ~#10 on the /r/atheism frontpage ([the post itself](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/15yg7s/this_quote_inspired_me_to_stand_up_to_my_fundie/), [taken at 14 hours old](http://i.imgur.com/HtIUW.png), [redditlog from same time](http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/384/461)). The image itself has apparently had 96,000+ views, [according to imgur](http://imgur.com/UdFsV).
 
 
Now, I'm going to break down what we did and why we think it worked:
 
 
### 1. Teen Demographic
 
It's fairly safe to assume that judging by the content and discourse of /r/atheism, and the demographics of reddit as a whole, that the teenage/early-20s audience is a large, if not largest, demographic on the subreddit. Because of that, it's important that you design a post around that demographic's weaknesses.
 
 
We decided that teen parental angst (and the latent angst from the early-20s ones) would be a prime motivator of our post's upvotes. Because of these, we opted for the ""fundie parents repressing me"" approach. That produced the title ""This quote inspired me to stand up to my fundie parents"", and the backstory we'll discuss later on.
 
 
Other topics that could also work may include:
 
 * Religion hating on homosexuals (Note: I didn't say LGBTIQ; reddit unfortunately has a fraught relationship with people in other ""queer"" situations, so you might catch the anger of the transphobic group inadvertently, for instance)
 * Creationism being taught in school
 
 
### 2. Demigods
 
Of course, to really get the upvotes, your quote needs to be attributed to one of the /r/atheism demigods. These are probably, in no particular order:
 
* Carl Sagan
* Neil Degrass Tyson
* Richard Dawkins
* Sam Harris
* Christopher Hitchens
 
 
(Let me know if you think I've missed any.)
 
 
Because of the space background (point 4), we decided it would be best to attribute the quote to Carl Sagan. We wanted to see how much people cared about the authenticity of the quote, so for maximum effect, we chose [Johannes Kepler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler). Who, to quote wikipedia, ""also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work, motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of reason"".
 
 
A quick browse of WikiQuote yielded the the quote we used, which tied into point 1 perfectly as a big ""fuck the haters"" type thing.
 
 
### 3. Backstory
 
Tying into point 1 above, we think it's helpful to comment on the post with an elaboration of the title, fleshing out the story presented, and possibly typing in other topics that /r/atheism will love you for.
 
 
It's important at this point to be very careful what you say; too much detail or bravery and people will probably call the story fake and unbelievable, too little detail and the same will probably happen.
 
 
We decided to opt for ""car ride argument"", which is a bit of a reddit favorite, tying in the topic of hating homosexuals:
 
&gt;In the car ride back from our baptist church last Sunday, my dad was ranting to my mum and me about homosexuality being sinful.
&gt;
&gt;The things he was saying made me so angry that I decided to come out as an atheist right there and then. This quote helped me realize that I don't need their thoughtless approval.
&gt;
&gt;Things have been tense at home since then. I'm worried about what might happen next.
 
 
At this stage, this comment only has 11 upvotes (and the top comment 21), so it's probable that most upvoters won't read it. However, I still think it's worth it.
 
 
### 4. Background
 
The people of /r/atheism see themselves as pseudo-scientists, and take a particularly liking to space (most likely related to point 2). Thus, a space background, particularly one that pays homage to [Pale Blue Dot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot) is a good idea to appeal to the masses.
 
Another popular choice is a picture of the quotes supposed author sitting ([1](http://i.imgur.com/hTfF9.png), [2](http://i.imgur.com/zQkP8.jpg), [3](http://i.imgur.com/AdlT3.jpg)) or at a lectern speaking, presumably owning theists ([1](http://i.imgur.com/2zVuV.jpg), [2](http://i.imgur.com/B2YMy.jpg)). All these pictures are from the first 150 top ranked /r/atheism posts of all time.
 
We didn't have an impossibly wide angle shot of a galaxy from which Earth could barely be seen, so we made ours up. [Here is](http://i.imgur.com/f3UbJ.jpg) the picture of TV static I took and darkened. Our circle of ""the Earth"" was just a random black space picked out. We also made sure to choose fonts that were fairly close to Comic Sans, but wouldn't arouse immediate suspicion.
 
 
### Summary and closing
 
This has been an interesting experiment; we didn't expect more that 5 upvotes, but it seems that /r/atheism is a worse circlejerk than we ever imagined. There was no vote manupulation or brigading involved. [It even got posted to /r/magicskyfairy](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicskyfairy/comments/15ypbe/this_quote_inspired_me_to_stand_up_to_my_fundie/).
 
Some other, shorter, points:
 
* **Timezones** - We posted this at around 11AM US time. According to reddit stats, lunchtime in the US is when activity really picks up. I think to be really caught in the wave of upvotes, then is the best time. Also, apparently Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday are the most active days. So keep that in mind also.
* **Account Age** - We used a throwaway, and it looks like the /r/atheism mods have flagged the post ""New User"". Also, several of the commenters were getting suspicious of that being the accounts first post. It's probably best to use an older account with history.
* **Upvote:Comment Ratio** - Right now the post as ~850 upvotes, but only 49 comments. It appears that most people don't read the comments. So despite (in our case) most people in the comments being skeptical, that hasn't impacted the posts popularity in any measurable way.
 
 
I'm interested to hear what circlebroke thinks of this.

1.

2.

I'm not posting any more examples because my brain can't take it. Hey look, I made a post that was within the rules. I practically coasted through the whole submission process.

One Redditor notes why he'll continue buying online despite the new policy:

&gt;Finally, common sense reigns.
Of course, You can still save tax by shopping online, so I'm still going to buy from someone else.

To which someone responds that you really shouldn't be ""saving"" that particular way:

&gt;I love how people think this is a point. You do understand that by law, you as the consumer of the product, MUST report the purchase and pay the taxes at year's end. Now, I understand, nobody does it and it is hard to enforce, but you still should. :)

The suggestion that Redditors ought to pay taxes to the government makes them very upset:

&gt;Why? Seriously, why? I live in Rhode Island. I don't want this stupid state to have any more of my money.

See, when Mitt Romney or Papa John pay taxes, it's to fund vital public services.  When Redditors pay taxes, it just goes into a sinkhole to be wasted by the state.

&gt;What are they doing that entitles them to a percentage of what I'm giving to Amazon? They had no hand in the sale one way or the other, but because of sales tax they somehow think they're missing out on something? My price goes up because the state I live in thinks they deserve a cut so the UPS man can drive on the roads to deliver the package?
They rob me plenty on the money I earn, why is it ok for them to take it from me when I spend it too?

Taxes=Robbery.  Do you think this guy just finished reading an Ayn Rand novel, or do you think tomorrow he'll be posting in /r/politics about how corporations need to pay their fair share?

&gt;The real solution is to not tax online purchases. I dislike the mentality politicians have about taxing everything. The online retailers are not breaking any law. Even if government sees an increase in tax revenue, they will overspend and start charging separate fees and explore new avenues for tax revenue. The taxes almost always get passed onto consumers.

If we raise more tax revenue, the government will just find a way to spend it and then want to raise taxes again.

Have a look at the manifesto the OP posts. This is a verbatim quote, I shit you not:

&gt; The things I had the largest problems with regard to the political climate in the states

&gt; 1. I believe that health care is a human right, your amount of money should not determine your access to a doctor. If you have more money, sure you can buy a nicer room, or a nicer hospital stay, but there should be a base leval of care for everyone.

&gt; 2. If you earn more, you pay more. Period.

&gt; 3. School should be free, the smartest people I knew in the states would never have enough money to go to school, and setting yourself in debt for the rest of your life for an education is insane.

&gt; 4. Religion has no place in politics, period. I don't want to hear about any ones religious values influencing their vote one way or the other.

&gt; 5. Being gay, or trans or however you ID yourself, should not mean you are a second class citizen. The government has no place to tell you who you can and can't marry based on their gentials.

&gt; 6. Higher taxses are necessarily a bad thing, they pay for the protections offered by the government, such as healthcare, schools, roads etc.

&gt; 7. Womens health/mens health with regard to reproductive rights, you have a right to understand how your body works sexual and control such function without shame or judgement.

ROK is short for ""Republic of Korea"", known informally as South Korea. DPRK is short for ""Democratic People's Republic of Korea"", known informally as North Korea*

The polls are in. On February 25th 2013, [Geunhye Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Geun-hye) will be officially inducted as South Korea's first female president. It's a monumental day for the nation that has the highest level of gender inequality in the developed world. Park's election has been met with a flurry of mixed reactions from the Korean citizenry. She is an unexpected dark horse coming into office at a unique and volatile time in Korean history. Relative to its size, South Korea is a massive cultural, technological, and economic powerhouse, experiencing the crippling throes of ongoing, jet fighter pace modernization and the constant threat of North Korea.

There is a growing divide of cultural clash between the younger and older generations, and having a conservative female leader is forcing the country to have a serious dialogue with itself. This is anything but a black and white issue. As a Korean-American with parents who grew up during [Chung-hee Park's presidency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung-hee), Geunhye Park's controversial father and former president of South Korea from 1962 to 1979, it's a very personal and fascinating topic. Doing a little research would inform you that South Korean politics is a heinous mudslinging match where the candidates accuse each other of horrendously hyperbolic shit. Can we trust redditors to do some light background checking before formulating their opinions about a political figure rather than basing it on a three minute perusal of her Wikipedia entry?

Who are we kidding?

&gt; [A bad day for women's right in korea, there's nothing worse than an ultaconservative woman as president of an already overtly sexist country. The fact she s a woman does not mean anything; the fact she s the daughter of an unrepented fascist (yes yes, admirer of hitler and all that) dictator does. The fact that she used the figure of his father to get to where she is now is even more important](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/153z2p/s_korea_has_its_first_woman_president/c7j2fqf)

Except she isn't [ultraconservative](http://groovekorea.com/article/presidential-preview-park-geun-hye). In fact, most of the Western media reported how similar she and her opponent [In-Jae Moon](http://groovekorea.com/article/presidential-preview-moon-jae) were on key issues. Both of their platforms revolve around a better welfare state (government spending on social programs is notoriously abysmal in the ROK), decreasing the massive amount of power wielded by [the chaebol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol), and reducing partisanship in ROK politics. The ultraconservative claim is even more ridiculous because *she has constantly been attacked for being single*. Madame Park has never been married nor does she have any children, and she has continually said she has no plans to marry or have kids in the future. Even liberal politicians in the ROK attack her over this because of the deep-rooted expectation that women must be married and childbearing. 

The key point where she and Mr. Moon differ on is foreign policy towards the DPRK, in which she takes a significantly harder stance than her opponent who advocated a very open plan of bilateral cooperation and trade. However, there's been a lot of disillusion with [the Sunshine Policy](http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2012/06/19/reassessing-the-sunshine-policy/) that was used prior to President Myunbak Lee's office, who took a harsher position against the DPRK. Madame Park said that she wants to stay open to diplomacy but will maintain a similar stance as her predecessor. Apparently this is totally unreasonable to redditors who believe that the DPRK, [consistently ranked as the worst violator of human rights on the planet](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2012/11/19/we-cant-ignore-north-koreas-human-rights-record) and ruled by [a legitimate dictator family that promote cults around itself](http://www.uscirf.gov/images/stories/pdf/nkwitnesses.pdf), should be treated like glorious, enlightened Sweden.

And the fact that she's a woman and the ROK's first female president doesn't matter whatsoever because she is LEterally the daughter of Hitler.

The latter part of what this redditor said about her father is what got me the angriest but I'll be addressing that further down.

&gt; [Ugh. South Korean women's rights frustrate me to no end.
The solution to gender inequality lies in removing gender from the equation where it is unnecessary, and in breaking the stereotypes and the mindset of gender roles. The attitude of many South Koreans, though, seems to be that women are inferior, and therefore the rest of society must compensate. That does nothing but justify the inequalities that currently exist.
The irony is that it's the women, the so-called ""feminists"", and the Ministry of Women and Family (which seems to prefer to call itself the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, although its official name in Hanja is 女性家族部) that are perpetuating this bullshit. What a joke. And Park Geun-hye seems none the wiser.](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/153z2p/s_korea_has_its_first_woman_president/c7j50jv)

Oh yes, of course. How silly of me to consider dozens of factors like culture, generational differences, and the existential crisis of Koreans trying to determine where the lines between modernization and westernization blur, leading to a serious critique of what aspects of their culture are to be celebrated and which aspects should be discarded for the sake of progress rather than for the sake of conforming to a Western expectation of how Koreans *should* be. I thought that the path to eliminating sexism in Korea was going to be something that required empathy, dialogue, and understanding.

All Koreans needed was some neckbeard to say, ""You have to break stereotypes and mindsets of gender roles!"" What a valuable and interesting new perspective that literally *no one in Korea has ever brought up*!

Let me also copy and paste the [Hanja from the Wikipedia article about the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Gender_Equality_and_Family) so it totally looks like I'm an expert on the esoteric subtleties of Korean-adopted Chinese characters instead of some smug douche who googled it in five seconds! The use of Hanja in the Korean language is either for ceremony or to convey cultural concepts quickly without the need for further explanation, kind of like the way one might use a cross to quickly convey the idea of Christianity or a church but the cross itself wouldn't necessarily be the name of a church. The Hanja name is almost never the official ""name"" of an organization unless they want to invoke some lofty, classical feeling.

He would have been less of a douche if he actually posted the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family's name in Hangul, the official Korean written language, but he still probably wouldn't have realized that the English name is a perfectly adequate translation instead of inferring it's some devious euphemism for a more dastardly Korean name like ""National Alliance of Friendzoning Whores"".

The literal translation of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family's Korean name, 여성가족부, is ""Female Family Tribe/Organization"".

[Her mother was *killed by a goddamn assassin*, taking a bullet that was actually meant for her father.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/world/asia/south-koreans-vote-in-closely-fought-presidential-race.html) She served as First Lady for five years until her father was successfully assassinated in another attempt, at which point she dropped out of politics. She returned to public service in the 90s during the IMF crisis in Korea. In total, she has over 20 years of political service. Madame Park has shown a consistent ability to rally her party and constituents when attempting to reject or pass legislation. Good leaders aren't always good speakers. Her debates may leave much to be desired and I don't always agree with her politics but this woman is a fucking boss. Whether you support her or not, she has demonstrated many times that she can get shit done.

Second, her father General Park led a military coup and ruled as an unopposed dictator but he also responsible for hoisting the ROK up from being a third world country and setting it on the road to becoming a major global player. Where the hell do these neckbeards get off calling anyone who liked him or lived under his regime brainwashed? My parents still remember being forced to go to US military bases and beg for leftover scraps because the country was so poor. The ROK was so poor that South Koreans [created an entire dish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budae_jjigae) around discarded GI food. The memories of these times are so painful that there are even movements calling for the banning of budae jigae because it hearkens back to a time when the living standards of ROK citizens were among the worst in the developing world. Did General Park do shady shit? Absolutely. The stuff about him detaining and torturing many people without trial is all true but there are no Koreans who would dispute this. Unlike the neckbeards chiming in, these people actually *lived* under his regime and experienced the good things and the bad things that came out of it. What they disagree with each other on is whether or not the General's ends justified his means.

Shit, my dad actually ended up becoming a student protester as a college kid in the 70s. He looked like some kind of Korean hybrid between the Fonz and Jimi Hendrix with his duck's ass hairdo, Aviators, bell bottoms that could house two Boy Scout troops, and a guitar he hustled off an American soldier from a game of eight-ball. Even his hippie ass liked General Park. He didn't *love* him, but despite the militant authoritarianism that came with the General's rule and craziness at the end of his regime, my dad was still was grateful that the General took over and didn't leave a nation still filled with starving vagrants and desperate criminals. Clearly the General is a controversial figure and for good reason. It's very hard to praise him as a saint of the people or renounce him as a ruthless demagogue but to redditors this distinction is totally lost. To be honest I was expecting them to praise the General given how apologetic /r/worldnews can get with dictators.

It's not even like these assholes are Korean. Why do they feel so strongly about the politics of a country they don't live in based off of second-hand kneejerk controversy on a goddamn social aggregator site? I don't get it. I truly don't fucking get it.

Okay. Rant done. I'm not even going to bother with all the StarCraft and ""North Korea Best Korea"" memes that are slowly beginning to pollute that thread.

There is a guy called 'Destiny' (or Steven Bonell), who is a minor celebrity in the world of Starcraft II.

'Destiny' was chatting/flirting with a girl known as 'Bluetea'.  She apparently shared nude photos of herself with Destiny and Destiny sent her photos of his penis (while having a girlfriend). 

Destiny then went on to ridicule her appearance to his friends in a chat room and one of them leaked the logs to Bluetea.

Humiliated, Bluetea logs into Destiny's twitter account (he gave her his password for some reason) and posted pictures of his dick ([see her reddit thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/yt1a8/to_spare_erin_heres_whats_going_on/)).

The bestof post was calling SRS out for being a ""downvote brigade"", downvoting every post linked to it. But bestof does the exact same thing. A perfect example would be the post that is meant to criticize so-called downvote brigades. The linked comment currently stands at 807 points, with 1035 upvotes. The post that the bestof'd comment was replying to, saying

is at -674 points, with 1028 downvotes. This strikes me as odd, because the subreddit it is in only has 10,000 subscribers, and the post it was commenting on only has 180 upvotes. That means that if bestof was following its own advice, 1/10th of the users in the subreddit both downvoted and upvoted those two comments. But, considering the nature of bestof, this is extremely unlikely. My point is, most redditors don't give a FUCK about downvote brigades. They just hate hate hate srs because they threaten their le me-mes and jailbait. They use ""LOOK THEIR A DOWNVOTE BRIGADE"" as an excuse to bitch about freedom of speech and how oppressed they are.

I've [posted jerkery](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/zbs9m/not_sure_if_example_of_the_jerk_or_just_of_jerks/) related to /r/AskHistorians here before.  It's one of my favourite subs on this otherwise ridiculous site *precisely because* the mods there do not fuck around on stuff like this.  No memes, no pun threads, no reaction .gifs, no joke answers, no pointless digressions or Reddit catchphrases or anything.  It's refreshingly like being in a community populated by actual adults.

And the rest of Reddit doesn't like that.  *Not one bit*.

The context:

**Two days ago**, an Asian specialist offered [an AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14bv4p/wednesday_ama_i_am_asiaexpert_one_stop_shop_for/) in /r/AskHistorians about various aspects of Asian history.  So far, so good.

**One day ago**, in the discussion that followed, some other guy posted a comment offering an appraisal of the bleakness facing modern Japanese youth.  The comment was [originally here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14bv4p/wednesday_ama_i_am_asiaexpert_one_stop_shop_for/c7bvgfm) - now it's a vast, featureless plane of [deleted]s.  Someone in /r/BestOf posted the comment's text [over there](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/14dvtn/tofutofu_explains_the_bleakness_facing_the/c7cflt0), though, so you can go read it if you like.  It's okay, I guess; nothing all that exciting.  Still, thousands of non-subscribers poured into /r/AskHistorians to read the comment and leave their own in turn, with consequences exactly as you imagine.

**Last night**, faced with the reality that the comment was not generating any good historical discussion, was rather generating hundreds of stupid posts in both that thread and in /r/AskHistorians generally, and was doing so at a rate very difficult to stem, the /r/AskHistorians mods decided to remove the comment and all of its off-topic clutter.

Which should have been the end of it, right?  Not only do the mods there have the power to do that, it also falls well within their clearly stated rules about crappy content, speculation, and discussion of current events.  Straightforward.

But no: it was actually the second coming of Hitler.

**Look, I know there are real problems in the world and with our economy.  So why aren't we spending more money in space and science?**
___

Science, logic, atheism: these should be the tenets of the US Government.  Why aren't we living on a moon base like Gingrich suggested?

&gt; [The economy is bad.  Let's spend money launching shit into space.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm41)

Look, I support space exploration.  But the global economy is down, and isn't going to recover for a few years at best.  Now isn't the time to spend money in space.  Shut up.

&gt; [The Curiosity Rover was cool.  Can we have more cool stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mp28)

Since we here at Reddit liked the rover, obviously everyone in the US cared about it.  More multi-billion dollar flying HD camera rovers in space 2012!

&gt; [This seems like a question about foreign policy and military spending... but seriously why aren't we spending more money in space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mopd)

Yes, let's divert all of our military spending into a space program.  Landing on the Moon ended the Cold War, so why aren't we landing on Mars to end the war in Afghanistan?

&gt; [As part of the European master race, I am deeply concerned about scientific literacy rates in America.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mojx)

I didn't even change this question.  Okay, I did, but not as much as you think.

Again, I support a strong space program just as much as the next guy.  But these aren't interesting questions for the President of the United States.

**Bro, what about weed?**
___

The President is doing an AMA?  I think we should ask him why marijuana is illegal thirteen billion times.  I'm not even going to separate these.  Just behold.

&gt; [You watch the wire? Why not legalize weed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmm6)

&gt;[Look, he's dodging these questions!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mrkr)

&gt;[You support the war on drugs = you can't stand up for your opinions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmjg)

&gt;[Don't raid me, bro!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mpx3)

Fuck you guys, this is not worthwhile content in a Presidential AMA.
_____
**SOPA was bad, Mr. President.  Are you going to save the Internet?**
____

The Internet is our inalienable right under the constitution.  So how come the government is trying to shut down the Internet, Mr. Obama?  Huh?  How come?  Why can't I have movies for free? Huh? Answer the hard questions!

&gt; [Talk to me about my Internet freedoms.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mlwx)

Because Obama isn't going to say ""I believe in keeping the Internet free and open.""  Because *anyone* would say ""I want to cut off your Internet freedom"".  Useful.

&gt; [The real issue here is the MPAA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mnv3)

This looked like a sort-of interesting question... until it turns out to subtly be about the MPAA.  Yes, they are the demons ruining America.  Tell us about how you will destroy them.

&gt; [A lot of us are concerned with copyright laws.  Specifically, we 16-year-old Internet piracy advocates.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmqr)

No, actually, most of us aren't concerned.  This question is also absurdly biased and I can't even deal.

&gt;[No seriously, we don't like SOPA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmrv)

Yeah guys we get it shut the fuck up.

&gt;[Just a remind, but Reddit stopped SOPA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mq7g)

No, we didn't.  Shut up.

*Bonus privacy jerk*:

&gt; [The TSA is bad. Get rid of it! I don't like them!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mq8i)

Yeah, airport security is a top issue on the ballot this November.  Surely you care deeply about long lines in airports that aren't really that long or invasive.  But I heard a story about a guy once, so the TSA sucks.

**I'm unemployed and/or don't understand how markets and the economy work.  I blame you for all of it.  Fix it! Fix it! [Fix it!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo3uxqwTxk0)**

In this section, a particularly special snowflake:

&gt;[I'm a law student in the worst market for lawyers ever.  How are you going to fix an industry you neither care about nor can influence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mnkw)

Yes, this is the President's job: to ensure that lawyers have jobs.  Yes, this is the President's job: to eliminate the debt that you assumed to pursue an advanced degree that you apparently can't put to use.  At least this question was sort of, kind of salvaged by asking about morale-boosting for the upcoming election.

3. [Metric jerk!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mrl6)  Because it's important for the President to support the Metric system.

____

Am I surprised that this AMA got completely ruined by shit, circlejerking questions?  No.  Am I disappointed?  Yes.

Am I completely disheartened?   No.  The President actually seems to be doing a good job of answering interesting or insightful questions and ignoring the circlejerking BS.  And there are still plenty of interesting questions to be answered.  I just hope those questions aren't crowded-out by the plethora of jerking nonsense being pushed on the President in possibly our only chance to hear what he has to say.",Quality Post,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,starflair,,True,t3_z1j7r,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/z1j7r/the_presidents_ama_jerking_it_in_obamas_face/,

I hate reddit, really. I disagree with the hivemind roughly 85% of the time, I'd say, but that's not why I hate it. I hate it because of what it's done to friends of mine. I'm a 24 year-old college grad in Arizona, and over the past 3 years or so I've watched a few of my friends completely abandon thinking for themselves, and instead they just parrot the opinions of the hivemind. 

One guy, in particular, is so bad that he rarely communicates anymore in non-meme form. Every text, tweet, and facebook status is either ""Scumbag ______"" or, ""I don't always...  but when I do..."" I don't know if it's sad or if it makes me angry, but it's aggravating nonetheless.

These guys (all guys, no girls I know fell into the reddit lifestyle - go figure) all fucking love NdGT, Carl Sagan, Gabe Newell, etc. To be honest I'd never heard of any of those people except Sagan prior to the incessant, obnoxious facebook love given to those heroes by my friends. Every day of the election season led to another 4 FB posts about rich, evil Mitt Romney, usually from sources like alternet. And heaven help you if you called them on their echo-chamber news sources - The Smugness, the defining quality of the redditor, would come out in full force. 

They proudly call themselves redditors *in public.* I'm posting this in my incognito browsing mode under an account I created 10 minutes ago, because I don't want people knowing I've ever posted to reddit. I just find it amazing, maddening, and depressing, that a group of otherwise smart people would fall into this. I understand checking this site because you're really bored at work, or alone on a weekend, but I can't imagine why a smart, mostly grown up adult, would choose to identify himself with /r/atheism's nonsense.

My question here is, have any of you noticed this phenomenon? And I don't mean among 16 year olds, or even college sophomores. They get a pass, for they know not what they do. But do any other mid-20s or older people see their friends exhibiting ""redditor"" behavior in real life? Communicating in meme-form, [fetishizing pop-scientific](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/377/415/c28.gif) drivel, or just general reddit-induced smugness?

I can ignore this site just fine, and I typically do. But it's extremely frustrating to see the ultra-obnoxious persona that reddit has cultivated seep its way into everyday life.

Because that's just one of the main sources  /r/CircleBroke fuel. Some of the jerks that occur there are the defining basis of the definition of ""circlejerk"". But what about some of the smaller subreddits?

It's a commonly stated phrase, ""The default subreddits are cesspools, but there is quality in the smaller communities."" Generally not those exact words, but I'd hope you understand the point I'm trying to make here. The fact is, there are small communities that can come off even jerkier. in an ironic way. Not with any humor at all.

In this corner. In the blue shorts. Sporting 3924 ""Masterminds"". All the way from Introvert, Neckbeardistan. /R/INTJ!

If you're aren't in the know (because you aren't a ""mastermind""), INTJ is a designation for one of the 16 personality types used in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test. We'll cover what entails being an INTJ later on in the tour, but I will tell you it stands for ""Introversion. Intuition. Thinking. Judgement"". It also is believed to only occur in 1-2% of the population. They're such special little snowflakes.

Now, as we take a journey into this pristine jerk, I ask that you all keep your hands and feet in the ride at all times, and no flash photography. It'll startle the introverts. 

As we enter /r/INTJ we'll first explore the sidebar to see the structure that forms this community.

&gt;For those who score INTJ on MBTI tests.

We're first greeted with a simple explanation on what the subreddit is. Seems fine to me. People with similar personalities getting together. In theory in sounds great, but we know what happens when redditors with similar views get together. Well, sometimes they jerk so hard we have a chaffing epidemic on our hands.

&gt;For ♀ there's also /r/2X_INTJ

Next, we have the link to the female specific INTJ subreddit. Simple enough.

&gt;MastermindBooks
&gt;http://www.reddit.com/r/MastermindBooks

They have their own book club! Not just books. Mastermind books! Sadly, not as hopping as the main subreddit. Maybe they're too busy being brilliant to read.


We then have a link to take the MBTI so you can learn if you're special or not. Followed by some informational explanations of what an INTJ actually is.

In our first explanation, we're greeted with an article titled ""Rational Portrait of the Mastermind (INTJ)"" From this article we not only learn about how special and brilliant INTJs are, but also that some of the greatest thinkers were INTJs. Bill Gates! Stephen Hawking! Isaac Newton! We're told about how prepared INTJs are. How they're no frills and are all about solving the problem and finishing the task. INTJs are logical and rational. INTJs make great Scientists and Engineers.

It already sounds like everything Reddit wishes they were.

The next explanation is a bit more in depth and covers a bit more of the downsides of INTJism.

&gt;Personal relationships, particularly romantic ones, can be the &gt;INTJ's Achilles heel. While they are capable of caring deeply &gt;for others (usually a select few), and are willing to spend a &gt;great deal of time and effort on a relationship, the knowledge &gt;and self-confidence that make them so successful in other &gt;areas can suddenly abandon or mislead them in interpersonal &gt;situations.

While it seems that INTJs are brilliant, rational, thinkers. It would also seem that they lack understanding of social situations. This seems to fit the stereotypical redditor more and more.

The bonus that we get from this article is a much bigger list of famous INTJs. Such as: Susan B. Anthony! Lance Armstrong! Augustus Caesar! Jane Austen! Dan Aykroyd! Chevy Chase! Michelle Obama! Arnold Schwarzenegger! Thomas Jefferson! JFK! Hannibal Lecter! And GANDALF THE GREY!

In our final article, we see INTJs referred to as ""The Scientist"" with this explanation:

&gt;As an INTJ, your primary mode of living is focused internally, &gt;where you take things in primarily via your intuition. Your &gt;secondary mode is external, where you deal with things &gt;rationally and logically.

Redditors see themselves as this, but they seem to forget to put the rationality and logical part in practice.

The rest of the page is a general explanation of the personality type. Where's the fun in that?

The rest of the sidebar are just more links to things. I might suggest checking out the forums. It gives more insight in the mind of a Mastermind.

Now, we can get into the actual fun. The real jerking. When I entered the subreddit, the first post was such a glorious jerk, that I wouldn't suggest sitting down or touching anything without using a condom.

&gt;[Fellow INTJs, do you view the vast majority of people as idiots?](http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/112n9c/fellow_intjs_do_you_view_the_vast_majority_of/)

Sure, we all think sometimes to ourselves, ""Why is everyone so stupid!?"" But to actually come out and discuss how everyone is an idiot and why you're so much better than them? Well that's a recipe for a great jerk.

The top rated comment in this thread is simply this:

&gt;Yes.

Luckily, we do have some people pointing out how smug it all is, but there are a larger majority of people agreeing. At least they didn't downvote the objectors simply for objecting. I'll give them that. But, there also great replies like these:

&gt;It's not smugness. It's a bald statement of fact, possibly slightly regretful. We don't want the rest of the world to be idiots. We'd be ecstatic if they weren't so stupid, or were at least stupid somewhere other than right next to us. It's annoying and exhausting.

&gt;The people I do run into on a daily basis seem to have a hard time comprehending that hitting themselves in the head with a mallet twenty times a day isn't something they actually have to do, and the alternative would hurt less.

&gt;Haha, vast majority might be an understating it...

&gt;The vast majority of people are either idiots or tools... maybe both.

&gt;I try not to. I really, really try. And then they go and do stupid thing after stupid thing after bloody idiotic thing, and I'm left wondering how they manage to breathe and feed themselves.
I once had a (pretty terrible) HR manager and boss accuse me of ""thinking I was better than everyone"".

&gt;I don't view them as idiots; they are idiots.

&gt;I do and that's one of the reasons my me and my ex broke up. She said that I shouldn't think that other people are stupid all the time. So, I figured after we broke up that I would try to not think this way. I then realised that I was right all along.
I'm a fairly intelligent man, I'm no genius, but still pretty smart. A large majority of the people in this world are pretty dumb. Sure it would be nice to to think the best of people, but life isn't nice. We INTJs may come off as arrogant and elitist, however I feel that it's well deserved. 


There is also the side that is pointing out how smug of a belief that is, but the point still stands that more people are upvoting this and agreeing with it, than are downvoting. This thread is still in its infancy. It could go anywhere.

We then find this post:

&gt;[Why are most of the people on this subreddit arrogant, narcissistic douchebags?](http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/112zim/why_are_most_of_the_people_on_this_subreddit/)

We find in this thread a person questioning the first thread we visited. As it stands so far from my view, smug comments seem to be on the rise. There are only a few comments, but they're gaining popularity.

&gt;We're not saying we're superduper incredible perfect people by any means. I know I've got plenty of flaws. But I do a lot of things very much better than almost anyone else I've met, including the ability to pick up in minutes skills which took them years or decades to achieve mediocrity in.
I don't feel that I'm super-brilliant. I feel like I should be average. But person after person after person I interact with day after day, many of whom are deemed professionals in their field, seem to have all the incisive intellect of a cheese sandwich.

&gt;Nope, I'm pretty sure we've always been like that. The reasons for what you describe are more likely constant disappointment in the stupid others, including countless ""I told you so"" situations.

Everyone sure is stupid except for us, right guys?

I must also note that there are legitimate threads on this subreddit about things other than how great INTJs are. Many are people struggling. Struggling with how AWESOME they are. They also discuss how difficult it is to be an introvert in a world ruled by extroverts. 

Feel free to browse yourself. You'll see that even the threads about the downsides to being an INTJ tend to have an arrogant twist to them.

[Even comedic (At least I hope it's trying to be funny.) posts are looked upon with contempt.](http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1111ll/the_complete_idiots_guide_to_the_intj/)

&gt;This article makes us sound like assholes... it just takes the truth and then adds a bunch of ego on top. Not representative of INTJ's at all.

&gt;Jokes apart, really, they make us look way too arrogant. 

I'm not a Mastermind, but I think denial is more than a river in the Amazon.

As you browse you may notice a theme. There seems to be an underlying prejudice against non-Masterminds. Not only are they all idiots. [They're also always trying to cut into my alone time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/110gz3/intjs_how_do_you_feel_when_extroverts_deny_you/)

&gt;I give them one-word answers and treat them coldly until they get the hint. My extrovert roommate decided to move into another room today, leaving it all to me.
Mission accomplished?

Excellent approach. Drive people away. But I think the next one is my favorite.

&gt;Like destroying Tokyo and putting all their loved ones to the fire and sword.
Ahem.
Unfortunately, my family (with the exception of my little brother) are all extroverts and seem to be completely incapable of understanding that sometimes I just need some space, even though I've been trying to explain it to them since I was a kid. My mother and I have a recurring argument every time I go back to visit for more than four days that usually ends with her declaring me to be selfish and asking why I dislike my family so much when finally, after days of nonstop family gatherings, coffees with old friends, big Sunday dinners, babysitting of the cousins, parties, etc., I dare to go to my old room for a while and shut the door when I can't stand to spend one more instant talking. Oh, parents. Moving out has made me love them more, but tolerate them less.

How dare your family want to spend time with you when you come and visit them.

I'd finally like to briefly cover the ""Top"" section.

Here you'll find that INTJs seem to actually find humor in some things. They do also seem to realize how truly introverted they are. Seeing as I've been rambling long enough, I'll just reiterate to take a look around. You'll find that even the less apparent jerk threads seem to always have an underlying level of a superiority complex.

I'd like to end the rant by stating that I have nothing against introverts. I may be a social butterfly, but I too enjoy my alone time. Everyone needs it. Especially myself. While I do have an extensive network of acquaintances and a core group  of incredibly close friends, I too find myself struggling some times socially. But that comes from reoccuring paranoia combined with my ""You're either with me or against me"" attitude. We all have our issues.

And here we end our tour. I wish it could have been more concise and maybe better structured, but I hope I may have shed some light on the fact that some redditors seem to live up perfectly to sterotypes. It's all quite entertaining. Some times the less apparent jerks can be fun to observe. But, are we any better? Yes. Because at least we'll admit it.

3. News article is posted to /r/science, upvoted if it has an interesting title
4. Commenters disagree with findings based on title of reddit post

Some examples to illustrate my point (**warning: I have participated in these threads**):

---

[""Women with endometriosis tend to be more attractive""](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/10prmm/women_with_endometriosis_tend_to_be_more/)

Actual finding ([non-free article](http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(12\)02127-9/abstract)): women with endometriosis, on average, have an earlier age of first sexual encounter, larger breasts, leaner bodies, and higher attractiveness as rated by a panel of judges. Maybe this is because estrogen-mediated feminization underlies both endometriosis and those markers. It already suggests new risk factors for the disease that may save women from sickness and infertility.

How do redditors feel about that? The top-voted comment and some followups:

&gt; the way they conducted this test (2 males and 2 females rating patients) seems like something out of that Archer episode (Marry, Bang, Kill).

&gt; ...

&gt; Immediately closed the article and down voted. What a joke.

&gt; ...

&gt; The problem with reddit, regardless of subreddit, is that it falls prey to typical media garbage like overspeculative or sensationalised garbage. We have plenty of people to upvote it and the minority is always going to be drowned out by the top comments, meaning that if something incredibly wrong hits the front page, you're shit out of luck and it's too late to try and save anyone from walking out the front door thinking ""severe endometriosis sufferers are attractive!""

&gt; ...

&gt; There are certain types of official pseudoscience that reddit already knows are bad (vaccines cause autism, homeopathy, etc) and they thinks this means they are rational, sceptical, and sciency. Then an article like this appears and no one knows what the script is and we bring on the stupid.

None of these people read the whole MSNBC article, which was actually fairly good: 

&gt; &gt; Other researchers took measurements of the women, and calculated their body mass indexes, their waist-to-hip ratios, and their ""breast-to-underbreast"" ratio — a measure of breast size.

&gt; &gt; Results showed that the women with severe endometriosis had lower body mass indexes, and larger breasts, than those without the disease.

&gt; &gt; The women also completed a questionnaire about their sexual history, and the results showed that women with severe endometriosis were more likely to have had sexual intercourse before age 18.

(Today) [""New study shows that with 'near perfect sensitivity', anatomical brain images alone can accurately diagnose chronic ADHD, schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome, bipolar disorder, or persons at high or low familial risk for major depression.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/14hfo9/new_study_shows_that_with_near_perfect/)

&gt; This is a fucking joke. All the disorders in the OP's title are spectrum disorders, ones that have clearly defined symptoms but widely different manifestations and scales. You can't diagnose complex disorders with no clear clinical definitions with 'near perfect sensitivity'.

&gt; ...

&gt; I had to snort &amp; sneer when I saw ""near perfect sensitivity"". junk science at its best.

&gt; ...

&gt; Junk reporting at its best...

&gt; ...

&gt; This should be the top comment. Kneejerk scientism is just as gothic in its sense of foreclosure as any form of superstition.

So actually, sensitivity and specificity have [precise meanings in science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity) and the article used them correctly. Diagnoses were classified according to standard clinical criteria explicitly listed in the paper.

Another gem:

&gt; Sensitivity is not the same as specificity. True positives will test as positive, but true negatives... who knows. A sensitive test that is nonspecific will lead to overdiagnosis. A brain scan should be used as a confirmatory test, not a screening test.

&gt; EDIT: Now that I scanned the abstract of the article, rather than just shooting from the hip reading the title of the post, I do see that the specificity was high. Good.

---

What I think is going on here is that these redditors enjoy the *findings* of science, like the fact of evolution or the existence of planets orbiting distant stars, but are totally uninterested in the *process* of science, like evidence-based argument and peer review. ([Maddox: ""You're not a nerd, geeks aren't sexy and you don't 'fucking love' science.""](http://thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=youre_not_a_nerd))

Consider the arrogance of attempting to refute a scientific study based on the title of a reddit post, or even on the content of a news article. Really? You think their observations could be explained by an alternative mechanism? Here's how a scientist would deal with that:

    look through the paper to see where they discuss why they eliminated that hypothesis

Here's how redditors deal with that:

    call the paper junk/pseudoscience, scold OP for deigning to post it, collect karma

And sometimes they may be corrected by people who pointed out that the issue is addressed within even the news article about the research.

I call this arrogance because it's as if these commenters believe that, in thinking for ten seconds about the punchline of the story, they have thought of some hidden variable that never once occurred to any of the researchers, who've spent years of their life working on this problem, and make a career out of saying things they can defend with evidence and picking apart other people's logic gaps; nor to any of the reviewers, whose entire role in this process is to find flaws and either require changes or reject fundamentally unsound papers. It's possible that you have a good point. What's arrogant is to assume no one else thought of it.

In other words, these people don't believe in scientific evidence or peer review. If someone proposes a result they don't like, the burden is not on them to familiarize themselves with the evidence and then provide an alternative explanation for it; rather, their armchair speculation is just as good as lab work and data collection, and more than sufficient to tell the researchers that their work is bad and they should feel bad. Science, to them, is just another internet argument.

---

One particular irony of the second example is that the reddit thread actually links to the research article itself, not a news article about it. There's no excuse for throwing out potential confounders and then not making an effort to find out how the study addressed them, because it's right fucking there. Some issues raised on reddit are even resolved in the abstract.

I think the fact that it made the frontpage is actually evidence of how few people even clicked on the link; research articles are written in a highly technical dialect that is mean to be very precise for experts, but may be entirely impenetrable to interested laypeople. Science reporting does exist for a reason. In fact, I actually downvote direct links to journal papers in /r/science, because even as a scientist myself, I am unqualified to read a paper from outside my field and would much rather have a layperson's explanation in plain English.

---

An even better irony is that it's an open-access article. Every time the issue comes up, redditors swarm to say how much they hate the idea that for-profit scientific publishing firms don't give away their product for free. After all, [much] science is paid for by taxpayers, so how is it fair to put up a barrier between the taxpayers and [professionally edited, formatted, published, and hosted summaries of] their data?! Never mind that journal articles aren't written for laypeople in the first place, and what they really need is better science reporting. 

No, *even when it's an open-access article, they can't be bothered to read it before they criticize - not even the abstract*. All this fuss about how scientific papers need to be open to the public, and yet the public doesn't need to see the papers to know they must be wrong.

---

Anyway, as a scientist I have mixed feelings about this. /r/science is a very popular subreddit, because redditors are so much in love with *some* aspects of science. See: Carl Sagan, Bill Nye, Neil deGrasse Tyson, enthusiasm for NASA funding (regardless of how much more science could be done with the same amount of money in NSF or NIH grants). That's good. They even think that they're being skeptical and scientific when they raise methodology concerns about new findings (whose evidence they haven't read). I guess that's nice, and it's true that good logic is good logic regardless of who says it. But what they don't understand is that science isn't a reddit thread, nor a democracy, and theories don't win by upvotes: there's an entire institutional structure of mercilessly and impersonally second-guessing each other's claims, so that only the really true stuff tends to get out. Of course it's not perfect and mistakes are made, but it's the best system we have and it works really well. By the time a result makes it through peer review into publication, it deserves a little more careful reading than a fourth-grade science fair project, probably by an expert who makes a career in that field, before you can conclude it's wrong. If something in a reddit title or a news article sounds fishy, the first thing you should guess isn't that the entire scientific establishment got it wrong.

",Bel_Marmaduk,475,116,248,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/wn1kl/meta_on_circlebroke_becoming_a_conservative/,"Hi Everybody. I initially brought this to the moderators but it was suggested I appeal to the community with a metapost.

I am presently concerned with the current overall state of the health of the circlebroke subreddit falling away from it's intended purpose. If you're here, it's probably because you're sick of constant Reddit hivemind mentality and shitposting, and that's great. It's what we built our community around. And it's true that one of the things that Reddit loves to shitpost about is politics, with the average Redditor being somewhere to the left of Marx and about as politically aware as a potato that votes for the US Green party.

Having said that, I feel we are starting to see the opposite pop up frequently on circlebroke, and am getting the sense of a growing percentage of hardcore conservative posters that bring the same lovely zealotry, extreme right thinking, complete lack of political awareness and reliance on memes/platitudes we've seen from the mainstream Reddit community. I want to remind everyone that /r/circlebroke is not /r/conservative or /r/libertarian or /r/republican. This is not the appropriate vehicle for your political beliefs.

Today, the following posts appeared on the circlebroke top 50 that are political in nature. At least half of these have a conservative bent.  At least a few of them aren't a reporting on a real circlejerk - just surprise that liberals have different views than conservatives, or that the conservative presidential candidate is not popular on reddit while the liberal candidate is. This isn't a circlebroke, this is 'what you would expect from a left leaning community'. We should not be shocked that people think differently from us, we should be shocked when people think stupidly, and that's part of why this concerns me.

In this particular thread, a reddit post on r/politics is linked. In the article that /r/politics is referenced, a non-english speaking man had a psychotic breakdown and began suffering paranoid delusions, was unarmed, chased by police (that he had called for help), put his hands up in the air against a wall (verified by unrelated, unbiased witnesses) and was shot to death. After the shooting the police took and destroyed the one piece of solid evidence. The response in the thread on circlebroke was overwhelmingly pro-cop, to the point of excess. As tired as I am of the anti-police circlejerk (you can see this consistently in my comment history) holy shit why would you pick this as your battle.

The one voice of reason in the thread:

[Free healthcare isn't free!](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/wk1ny/free_healthcare_isnt_free/)
This post is a meta post pointing out that circlebroke is beginning to circlejerk inadvertantly with the 'free healthcare isn't free' topic. Two unironic replies:

&gt;But it isn't free. It's spoiled, disingenuous and entitled to call it free.

*** 

&gt;I think the point that free healthcare isn't free is a very valid one. Obviously it is taking money from one group of people to give to another group of people. It is essentially legalized stealing that is deemed OK as long as at least 50.00001% of people agree with the stealing.

&gt;Also, It is blatantly unconstitutional and immoral to be forced to buy any sort of product in the US. If that precedent is set where will it end? The government should not be allowed to forced its citizens to buy anything. This is a government that is supposed to be under the control of the people, not the other way around. Anytime, you let the government take control of a part of your life you are allowing the few to control the lives of the many.

&gt;In addition, the government is very inefficient. They have proven that without the stresses and competition a free market provides they waste a ton of money. So this will be no different. Healthcare costs will eventually rise on the whole because of all the inefficiencies the government will introduce.

Ignoring for a second that every candidate does this to every candidate during every election since the dawn of American politics, this is unambiguously a pro-Romney thread where someone is shocked that somebody else has different political beleifs than him. Not everyone likes Romney. If somebody is suggesting that Romney is secretly gay, or that Romney should be hurt, or that Romney is a racist because of some unverified story etc etc, OK - but why is a thread about Romney refusing to release his tax returns circlebroke material?

Some of these threads are perfectly fine and contributing, others are just kind of dumb circlejerk threads of a bunch of right-leaning individuals expressing incredible shock at the idea that people think differently then them. And others are just bandstanding about politics - but is this really the place? Is this the place where we debate the merits of political positions or talk about how misguided the liberals are in how they want to run the country?

On top of that, disagreements are now being responded to with downvotes, which is not what Reddit is supposed to be about, and certainly not circlebroke - the stylesheet even gives you a popup message telling you not to downvote because you disagree with somebody, but it is rampant in these political threads and it is becoming an increasing problem. ""Well, Bel_Marmaduk"", you say, ""Why not ignore political threads if you don't agree with circlebroke's political leanings?""

Because:

1. Ignoring a circlejerk counterintuitive to why anybody posts on /r/circlebroke
2. Because your politics threads are now taking up between 20 and 25% of the main page at all times.

12 of the top 50 posts are politics threads. That's nearly 1 in 4. It is simply not reasonable to avoid these threads. And unfortunately, with downvoting opinions in full effect, it's also not entirely reasonable to expect non-conservative redditors to engage in these discussions, which is just serving to chase people away from this SR. 

What is the alternative? I would propose we try to police ourselves, as a community better. There is times where something just isn't really a circlejerk - there's a difference between somebody having a political opinion and engaging in a circlejerk. These don't really belong here. And there's times where maybe posting another ""/r/politics is at it again!"" thread is not appropriate - there is at least 3 on the main page that could have been comments appended to another politics article.

As you've probably all heard, Pope Benedict XVI has resigned effective February 28th. A subreddit about atheism really shouldn't care about this, but of course /r/atheism is delighted. Not only is the subreddit dominated by posts about the pope; it is full of regurgitated jokes, memes, and facebook screencaps that have VERY little do with this news. I'll run down /r/atheism's ""hot"" posts until we get to an actual news story about the pope's resignation.

&gt; [I personally will miss the pope](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/18b9qd/i_personally_will_miss_the_pope/)

A ""Scumbag Steve"" hat on the pope because he quit eight years after God chose him. 

&gt; [Advanced age?](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/18b6z4/advanced_age_pidjin/)

""Pope Benedict is resigning because of his advanced age. Well put. We do live in an age that's too advanced for popes.""

Not linking to this because, as the #7 hottest link on the subreddit, it is the first not to mention the pope's resignation.

&gt; [Frankie Boyle's theory on why the Pope is resigning](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/18b0hl/frankie_boyles_theory_on_why_the_pope_is_resigning/)

Because ""he's shagged an adult woman."" Yup, more pedophile jokes.

&gt; [Hey guys, the pope is resigning](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/18b2r0/hey_guys_the_pope_is_resigning/)

A gif of someone beating a dead horse. The subreddit briefly shows some self-awareness, albeit in gif form. However, the comments all strongly disagree and downvote the OP when he tries to explain himself.

&gt; [I found out who the next Pope will be](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/18b5k6/i_found_out_who_the_next_pope_will_be/)

A meme predicting a bunch of talk about the pope.

A picture of the pope with the text, ""I have been on /r/atheism. It has some compelling arguments."" Obviously made in jest and gets a negative response, but... wow.

I've seen quite alot of posts on /r/circlebroke[1] about hating reddit for it's general stupidity and general 'lack of manners'. However, my superiority complex is just wanting me to talk about how /r/atheism[2] is just simply making me angry. For example, here is a 'gem' I found ...

&gt;If this subreddit is not open and free, then I honestly don't see the point. Socrates died for this shit and we're taking it too lightly.

Actually, you know what, I'm going to paste a couple more 'euphoric' quotes I can find that found make any sane person cry...

 &gt;Christians have been trying for a long time to get rid of this sub-reddit, and with this mod policy change they've gotten the next best thing. Now, atheism doesn't seem so exciting or interesting and will seem as boring as their religion...If the reputation of /r/atheism is terrible it is because christians go all over the internet spreading that reputation to keep people away. 

&gt;Let this day (or yesterday rather) be known as the one day in history where OPs sexuality was overlooked and overshadowed by the homosexuality that was the mods. Yes, for one day, OP was not a faggot. It was the mods this time. 

The fact that all these posts were going 'positive' so to speak is bad, the fact they were all over +200 in just hours is a travesty.

And that is not even the tip of the delusional iceberg. These people in this subreddit are just straight up delusional. And before you ask, I am an atheist. However, I don't believe that this really matters because no matter what religion you are, I think any sane person can agree that /r/atheism[6] is a craphole which is being ruled by twelve year olds who cannot comprehend reading longer then the two sentence quota of those god-damn Surburban House-wife.

How stupid of me to think that these new moderation rulings would make the people more mature. Stupid stupid me.

Which in itself is at least a semi valid question. Religious differences can often cause problems in relationships and a discussion about how to live with a religious significant other and reconcile your differences in belief, or how to over come religious differences while dating would not be without merit. Of course that's not what OP is interested in at all.

Maybe he just means he wishes he was part of a community similar to churches with a tight knit community where you get to know a lot of people you share something in common with.

NOPE

&gt;Did I suggest I want to date a religious woman?  

&gt;I didn't mean to imply that.  

&gt;I want to have ""Church Picnics"" but there's beautiful single atheist women there the entire community wants to hook me up with.

Oh boy. I don't really think I need to explain this comment. Apparently outside of church there are absolutely no communities or groups of people of friends that you could join. Obviously a *religious* person is beneath my le progressive and evolved tastes, but if only there were Atheist havens where beautiful women flocked to nest within my neckbeard plumage. Surely I could find the beautiful, hot, smart, and funny girl to mate with that I deserve. 

I don't really need to elaborate further. He seems like the prototypical atheist-neckbeard-virgin. He describes himself as perpetually single, but clearly the only thing standing between him and true love is his superior atheist beliefs. 

There are some other comments that seem to come from sensible people, but then there are also posts like

&gt;I'd rather be alone than be with a girl who believes in an imaginary fairy in the sky.

and the response

&gt;I think in the short term, anyone is better than nothing. But I don't think I could ever stay with a religious person.
I don't want to go to an actual church picnic, with the religious people. I want the whole setup, without the religious people, and normal people instead.
I want the social and stuff. Just that old town life. ""Oh you don't have a job? Here come work for me, I know you're a good guy!"" ""Oh you're single... I know the perfect girl for you! She has great critical thinking skills!""

First, a little background. I use the browser Rockmelt, which allows you to add applications to the side of your browser. One of these applications is reddit, but, unfortunately, it shows only posts from defaults and only posts that have a bunch of quick upvotes instead of front-page items. This is what led me to the incredibly BRAVE submission some of you may have seen on askreddit yesterday, a literal gem of fantastic discussion and intellectual prowess.


&gt;[“Why do Americans assume they're more 'free' than every other first world country?”](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/174b1l/why_do_americans_assume_theyre_more_free_than/)


This is gonna be a good thread.


Let's discuss the submission itself. I'm having a really hard time figuring out if this is a troll or an actual post. It seems like lately there's been an influx of “I'm not a member of this group, but why does every one of them think...” posts lately (like that embarrassment  about Black History Month). What does this person honestly think people will say? It's pretty condescending, so it doesn't really lend itself to anything but a circlejerk about how Americans are wrong, which the OP himself participates in throughout the thread. Let's look at his comments first.


&gt;[You can either explain to me why you think Murica' is the land of the free bullshit or if you feel america isn't free, or you can get angry at the way I phased the question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/174b1l/why_do_americans_assume_theyre_more_free_than/c822iwv)


You read that right, that's a non-ironic “'Murica”. It's these comments that make me doubt if the post is genuine. Thankfully, this sits at a -7, so let's look at OP's positive comments.



&gt;[You had slavery when you were founded, so should it be called ""The land of the free but only if you're white""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/174b1l/why_do_americans_assume_theyre_more_free_than/c8229yg)


Ooh, got me! Shoot, this post actually reminded me I have to go feed my slave right now. This one's at +9.


&gt;[You're so free that if you don't say you're free you get kicked out of school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/174b1l/why_do_americans_assume_theyre_more_free_than/c823ar2)

This one hits reddit in all the right places, at +25. We'll come back to here, because boy does reddit hate the pledge. But for now, let's look at top-level comments.


Thankfully, the top comment is calling out the OP or being an asshole, and the top level replies back him up. Unfortunately, the third comment-er makes the unfortunate mistake of mentioning Sweden and high occurance of rape. That leads us to this nugget of wisdom:


&gt;[This is mostly because a high tendency to report these crimes. Kind of like the unusually high numbers of rape in Sweden. It's good, not bad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/174b1l/why_do_americans_assume_theyre_more_free_than/c8240tl)


I'm not a scientist, but... uh... isn't... isn't more rape generally a bad thing? There's probably still tons of unreported ones, right? Anyway, this is at +12, but it looks to be taking a nosedive. Let's move down a comment chain.


&gt;[Propaganda.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/174b1l/why_do_americans_assume_theyre_more_free_than/c8229xv)


Yeah, that's worth 503 points. Boy, I love waking up and doing jumping jacks in front of the telescreen while I sip victory gin. DAE Ignorance is Strength? There's a really good reply below it growing fast. Along with the fair rebuttal, however, there is plenty of jerk to be had.


&gt;[I seriously don't understand how anyone could support this pledge of allegiance. It's propaganda and child manipulation at its best. 70 years ago, the classrooms in my country looked exactly like this, except the right hands weren't on their hearts, but up in the air.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/174b1l/why_do_americans_assume_theyre_more_free_than/c8230mx)


+20. That link goes to a picture of a classroom doing the Nazi salute. You heard it here, folks, the pledge of allegiance is LITERALLY Hitler.


The third comment chain devolves into “can you feel safe in America” comments. One below:


&gt;[I travel all over the US for work, and meet many people in the lower 48. Personal Safety is not a feeling I encounter often, it is more often fear. From the guy in South Carolina who felt the need to carry a pistol while jogging to my wife who carries a .38 while hiking. [...] the internal opinion I get from people is that the US is the best place in the world, and the safest at the same time. Cognitive dissonance at its finest.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/174b1l/why_do_americans_assume_theyre_more_free_than/c823sc4)

+21. Here's another fantastic addition.


&gt;[I really don't think US is safe at all if compared to any other first world country. I would go on to say that it's probably the most dangerous 1st world country there is - right between Thailand and Belarus on its murder rate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/174b1l/why_do_americans_assume_theyre_more_free_than/c823sms)

+13.


Then we hit what I like to call the jerk apex: that beautiful place where the most jerky opinion lies: too heavily downvoted to be the top comment yet controversial enough to appeal to the hivemind. This beauty is at 433.


&gt;[Every time a kid is yelled at, or an underachiever doesn't live up to his mentors, we're reminded that Hey this is America, you can do as you please. We're told from birth, through death, that this country, of all countries is the place to be if you really want to succeed. […] It's more subconscious than anything, like very subtle(yet not so subtle) propaganda that starts when you take your first history class and you learn the warped truth of the fact that we were 'the first' colony to overthrow The Brits (it was barely a victory) and we inspired pretty much everyone else (probably not). It's a hard programming to fight when you're a useless piece of shit collecting welfare sitting on a couch and doing nothing with your life.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/174b1l/why_do_americans_assume_theyre_more_free_than/c822kfc)


After reading this comment, my left arm exploded in a burst of bravery. I immediately ran out of my house, got a visa, bought a house in Denmark, and stopped by the welfare office on the way to the airport to punch every person inside for being useless and remind them that the American revolution was barely a victory. After this comment, the guy continues to make his point in the most condescending way possible (let me explain this using [MODERN DAY TERMINOLOGY](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/174b1l/why_do_americans_assume_theyre_more_free_than/c823dt4), I doubt your stupid American mind could remember anything that happened in the last year.)



I don't know what else I can say about this thread. It's been up for about five hours now, so I need to get this submitted before the comments I mentioned inevitably get downvoted into oblivion. I'll just leave you with this pinnacle of redditian knowledge.


&gt;[As a Canadian, I feel ""free-er"" than most Americans.
I won't necessarily need to file for bankruptcy if I am involved in an accident.
I won't go to prison for a decade for smoking a joint.
I have more than 2 political viewpoints for which I can vote.
I need not worry about my country falling off a ""fiscal cliff"" time and again.
We're not at war.
I can drive into the middle of nowhere - absolutely alone - in less than 30 minutes and do whatever the hell I want without surveillance. Although there's not really anything I want to do that requires that.
But on the downside, the Queen is on my money. On the plus side, God is not.

The thing that kills me about this circlejerk is that (1) it's okay to bash science in schools so long as (a) you can blame your shitty life on some test or teacher, or (b) you feel inadequate in any way, but (2) if any politician said any of these same things, (a) he'd be accused of being a fundie caveman corporate shill, and (b) he'd be the subject of a torrent of image macros about how gaytheist science has improved his life and he should kill himself now. Furthermore, (3) Reddit has a massive boner for science because it's full of **hard truths** and **facts**. That is, until (4) dropout would-be scientists demand that science get more sugar coating to make it easier (***but still better than the bullshit humanities lol***). And (5) apparently having a positive aesthetic response to a television show makes you a young scientist.

    *B-but father... your stories of the monsters beyond the Forest-- screeching and mewling in shrill, inhuman tones, with slitted noses and wide eyes like a tarsier... how do I ward off such ugly beasts?*

--------------------------------------

**FIRST IMPRESSIONS**

--------------------------------------

^(*Disclaimer: I'm a relatively casual anime viewer.  I am not a longtime subscriber to /r/anime.*  ***Some links may contain spoilers.***)

**Imgurosity**: Deceptively low at first glance (36 of 50 frontpage posts are selfposts), but the [top scoring list](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/top/) reveals high levels of imgur, peppered with some videos (clips, parodies, or ""anime music videos"") and the occasional link to a blog/website.  The [first](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/z8q8i/i_would_just_like_to_take_this_moment_to_pay_my/) selfpost on the list is at #84, with a pandering but heartfelt ""thank you"" to amateur subtitlers that inexplicably sounds like a eulogy.  The [second](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/14el3h/fuck_you_ranime/) is at #106 and is void of all worth.  The [third](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/16tggn/what_anime_do_you_regret_watching/) is miles down at #306, and the rest are presumably deep within the earth's core.

Let's take it a step further, since I literally have zero life.  I scrolled down the list until I got to 1000, then I ctrl+F'd for ""self.anime"" and got 18 hits.  Two are modposts, and two just contain images anyway.  That leaves us with 14 selfposts in the top 1000.  Of course, this is to be expected of a large forum with a broad theme and somewhat lenient moderation.

I should reiterate that there *is* a rule against meme/macro/advice animal/etc posts, which is great.  Surprisingly, there don't appear to be any meme-specific anime subreddits to fill that void, but perhaps they're satisfied with just using them in the comments, which is [far from uncommon](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/vxu59/yuruyuri_season_2_episode_1_discussion_spoilers/c58kirv).

**Discussion**: Decent or poor, depending.  Vague and simple topics like ""[anime drinking games](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/17ua4s/anime_drinking_games/)"" understandably garner far more replies than, say, an [analysis](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/15aor4/flcl_analysisepisode_1/) or [examination of themes](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/17x8uo/princess_mononoke_anime_and_the_myth_of/), which are rare and not nearly as popular.  I'd attribute this to the fact that the focus of the main sub is too broad to foster discussion, but offshoot subreddits that focus on serious discussion (/r/trueanime, /r/japaneseanimation) are barren in comparison and show-specific subs don't fare much better.  /r/naruto, for example, has a noteworthy 17,500 subscribers but minimal discussion -- though this may be because the show is targeted at younger viewers to some extent.  

Episode discussion threads tend to be better.  Some questionable voting habits aside (see below), it's possible to get a [pretty good conversation](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/zzsbu/hyouka_episode_22_discussion_spoilers/c69hpo0) going about the plot, characters, themes, etc.  But all in all, the sub is largely geared towards [fun](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/17hc6a/describe_your_favorite_anime_in_the_most_boring/), [simple](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/rfap5/dae_ever_get_really_sad_borderline_depressed_when/), [lighthearted](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/179fzk/who_is_your_favorite_female_character/) topics (again, this is to be expected).  That's not a negative thing in itself - not every discussion needs to be an academic seminar - though it would be nice to have some more intriguing conversations than ""fave character ever"" sometimes.

**Voting**: Pretty awful.  We've already seen how the top-scoring list looks, and voting habits on comments aren't any better.  From what I've seen, dissenting opinions are mercilessly smothered and pithy pandering shoots to the top - criticism in episode discussion threads is often met with downvotes and scorn ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/reie5/another_episode_12_discussion_spoilers/c4566s0), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/14cf3k/spoilers_chuunibyou_demo_koi_ga_shitai_episode_10/c7bulfu), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/177d8r/spoilers_kotourasan_episode_3_discussion/c82xx05), [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/111xrr/sword_art_online_episode_14_discussion_spoilers/c6ipwmi), [5](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/16cgbx/sasamisanganbaranai_episode_1_discussion_spoilers/c7uy619), [6](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11t6in/sword_art_online_episode_16_discussion_spoilers/c6pr3p7), [7](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11t6in/sword_art_online_episode_16_discussion_spoilers/c6pe4od), [8](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/15agbd/sword_art_online_episode_25_end_discussion/c7kp0fa)).  Some might argue that this is based on quality, but it's pretty clear that oftentimes the top comments aren't exactly quality either ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/154437/spoilers_chuunibyou_demo_koi_ga_shitai_episode_12/c7j9l8f), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/15x3ji/nekomonogatari_kuro_episode_4_discussion_spoilers/c7qnkdn), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/15ync1/spoilers_maoyuu_maou_yuusha_01_discussion/c7r16hw)).  Par for the course for a subreddit of this size... but disappointing nonetheless.

**Moderation**: Hard to say.  All mods are fairly active, excluding the sockpuppet account.  The mod/member ratio and overabundance of imgur links would imply a laissez-faire moderation style, but spoilers, memes, etc are handled with some reliability.  There doesn't seem to be much mod-userbase interaction (mod posts and organized events are rare, /r/metaanime is pretty vacant). *[Edit: people have pointed out that a lot of mod/user interaction takes place in the [IRC channel](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/izyre/join_us_in_our_irc_channel/).]*  The subreddit is probably too big to effectively police fighting words, voting habits, standards of effort, etc, and quality can sometimes suffer as a result, but overall no glaring issues.

**Surprises**: I expected a lot more of two things: glorification of Japan, and victim complexes about how anime is so misunderstood and anime fans are super oppressed.  Haven't seen much of either.  There *is* the occasional ""[why do these *baka gaijin* misunderstand anime](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/g7o5k/my_sister_just_told_me_that_anime_isnt_art_and_i/)"", as well as some pretty odd [mischaracterizations](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/x13l6/a_bunch_of_questions_about_japan_things_that_i/) of Japanese culture, but not too bad overall.  I was pleasantly surprised by that. 

 

--------------------------------------

**JERKS, QUIRKS, and TROPES**

--------------------------------------

- [Subs rule, dubs are for filthy, pathetic peasants.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/frqyt/how_many_redditors_only_watch_anime_in_japanese/)

- ""Mainstream"" shows are often reviled - particularly Naruto and Bleach.  Ghibli films, Kyoto Animation, and favorites like Cowboy Bebop, Madoka Magica and FLCL are revered, though not without reason I suppose.

- The age-old reddit tradition persists: [self-congratulatory ""i love u guise"" thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/sani3/anime_changes_lives/).  We did it reddit!

- While meme *posts* are forbidden, meme *comments* are omnipresent.  Every mention of the anime ""School Days"" will result in a reference to boats, for example - happened [eight months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/tjii5/so_today_i_sat_down_and_watched_school_days/c4n5pa2), and continues to happen [today](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/17w5e7/i_want_to_thank_whoever_recommended_school_days/c89dao4?context=1).  Also, [""Endless Eight""](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/11eu5p/i_just_watched_all_of_the_haruhis_endless_eight/) is literally worse than Auschwitz, amirite fellas??

- Criticism of subreddit-approved anime is generally not tolerated (see ""Voting"" above), particularly in episode discussion threads.

- Episode discussion threads sometimes become ""quote your favorite part"" threads, especially for comedies ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/14h7e0/jojos_bizarre_adventure_episode_10_discussion/c7d625i), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/16rjpy/kotourasan_episode_2_discussion_spoilers/c7yqv61), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/vxu59/yuruyuri_season_2_episode_1_discussion_spoilers/c58kirv), [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/17nr1x/boku_wa_tomodachi_ga_sukunai_next_episode_4/c8778y0), [5](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/177d8r/spoilers_kotourasan_episode_3_discussion/c82vqvx), [6](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/17nr1x/boku_wa_tomodachi_ga_sukunai_next_episode_4/c876n7c)).  Screenshots and gifs are obviously also common.

- Requests for anime recommendations are [despised and buried](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/search?q=recommend&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all), which is understandable considering how common they are.  However, the [recommendation wiki](http://redditanime.wikia.com/wiki/The_massive_%22I_just_got_in_to_anime%22_recommendation_list) is bare-bones and /r/animesuggest is not nearly as active as the main sub.  Recommendation threads *are* still allowed, so it seems like a mixed message to send.

 

--------------------------------------

**GENERAL IMPRESSIONS**

--------------------------------------

Middling, but overall slightly positive.  Go there to rave about (currently) popular anime, chat about favorite scenes/characters, and see some [cute gifs](http://booru.ehkzai.com/index.php?q=/image/13233.gif) or [cool fanart](http://i.imgur.com/Qf09g.jpg).  Don't expect too much analysis or weighty discussion; try not to disparage beloved shows and you'll be fine.

--------------------------------------

 

And so, six months later, I returned to the village with my [spunky and cute childhood friend](http://imgur.com/7EnyIOs) in one arm and a [semen-encrusted body pillow](http://imgur.com/CqbkZu8) in the other, as a [generic mascot character created solely for merchandising](http://imgur.com/UM2oBml) gleefully hopped behind us.  Father stood by the riverbank in his [battle mecha](http://imgur.com/LU2lqBr), facing us, as if he knew we would be coming.

    *My son.  Your gait is confident, your neckbeard, thick... I think it's time I let you have this battle mecha.*

    *But... but father-kun!  Only the chieftain of this village--*

    *You are the chieftain of this village now.  My time has come.*

    *...Father-kun...*

And then there were forty episodes of filler.  The end.

Needless to say: Spoilers ahead!

Since r/lounge is made up of only the best commenters on reddit, people so witty and/or insightful that someone actually *gave them money* for their words, r/lounge is like reddit distilled. Pure, uncut reddit, 24/7.

Please enjoy a screenshot of the current frontpage of r/lounge:

http://i.imgur.com/bTZl7.jpg

As you can see, r/lounge is made up exclusively of upvoted pictures of golden things (because reddit-gold! gettit?) and picture of archaic ""high-class"" things like men wearing waistcoats (because there is something ""classy"" about Reddit-gold).  That's it. That's all that's ever posted there.

The comments on these delightful photos are all from the point of view of faux-dandies, with even more ""good sirs!"", ""huzzah!"", and ""You, sir, are a sir!"" than you can find on the rest of reddit. There are lots of inline images of people wearing tophats too. So if you've ever wanted reddit to be even more annoying, buy reddit gold!

Check out this comment, recommending r/proper: 

&gt;Ahh A fantastic little brother sub to /r/lounge. I do say I enjoy popping over for a quick drink with the lads every now and again. It's quite refreshing to not hear the plebs moan about their sinking gold all the time.

Or this one:

&gt;our downvotes extinguish the posts of the unworthy like the great tidal waves of Poseidon.

That's pretty much how everyone writes there. It makes me want to punch language itself.

While r/lounge's ""high class"" tone is undeniably self-deprecating, you get the feeling that while everyone is joking about their ""higher"" status, they kind of believe it a little bit, or they really wish it was true.

A normal person might find r/lounge's pseudo gentleman pose and pointless pictures amusing for about 16 seconds, so you'd expect it to not update that often, but It's actually a pretty well trafficked sub, with a steady influx of pictures of doubloons and assholes from 1917 in bathing costumes. 

Interestingly, there even seems to be a class divide within r/lounge. The people who have purchased Reddit gold for themselves look down on those with gifted reddit gold, so you see lots of comments like this:

&gt;Someone gifted me a first month, but I quickly became accustomed to the fine company in the lounge, the gem encrusted, gold lifestyle and bought myself a year's subscription. No sad last day as they repossess my favorite virtual leather armchair and slippers for me. Cheers!

I'm not sure why you'd brag about throwing 25 dollars down a fucking toilet, but maybe that's the point. Maybe it's a way of saying ""I have so much real life money, I give it away to a terrible website in exchange for the privilege of looking at pictures I could find by typing 'things that are gold' into google.""

So there you have it. Tour complete. If I save one person from buying reddit gold, the 15 minutes it took me to type this won't have been in vain.

In subs like advice animals, memes like PC redneck and Successful Black Man are fairly harmless, but still perpetuate the idea that racism = okay.

There was even a fucking AskReddit [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uzsr9/racist_redditors_what_makes_you_dislike_other/) asking people to share their racist opinions. And the racism isn't limited to blacks, oh no. Gypsies are the the subject of the most vile, unadulterated hate. [In my opinion gypsies are worse than animals.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/uzsr9/racist_redditors_what_makes_you_dislike_other/c502ek2) Oh, and don't forget [Jews.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/yda44/are_steam_scammers_getting_worse/c5umfeq)


Well, you get my point. Reddit is racist. But **why**?
The long answer is incredibly complex, and many factors cause people to be racist. One could argue that the human race is inherently racist. But the short answer lies in a few factors. Reddit's anonymity (perceived or real), mob mentality (aka hive mind), demographics, and ability to make excuses are all factors, and probably the most important ones.

The first reason that redditors are racist is because of the perceived anonymity of reddit. Reddit grants the ability for people to create a screen name, and in seconds become a stranger to everyone. This is important for one reason, a screen name has no reputation to uphold. This is probably the #1 reason racism exists on the internet at all. Neckbeards, with so much pent up rage, can unleash it all with no fear of being judged. If you are a racist fuck and want to run around calling black people niggers, the internet is your destination. How well do you think someone calling their co-worker a ""stupid fucking nigger"" would fare in the workplace? Not very well, not very well at all. But on teh interwebz, there is no reputation to uphold. 

The second reason the mob mentality of reddit. What do you get when  a lot of opinionated people (with the same opinion) get together and pat each other on the back, or in reddit terms, *circlejerking?* You get the hivemind. The hivemind plays an important part in aiding racism  not only because of racist views, but because the sheer number of redditors convinces others that their views are correct. This is the reason that gypsies are so unpopular on reddit, because people with no knowledge on the subject look at an anti-gypsy comment with 900 upvotes, and think ""*wow, could 900 people be wrong? Gypsies must be horrible people!""* 

The third reason that reddit is racist is becuase of demographics. The vast majority of Redditors are 15-25 year old male WASPs minus the protestant. Many of them live(d) sheltered lives in the suburbs, and probably never interacted with minorities or had any opinion forming experiences outside of TV, movies, and music. When someone like that first has an experience with a different culture, the experience is probably quite jarring. ""People call this shit music?"" an especially *classy* neckbeard might say. ""I only listen to really deep stuff like queen"". The age range also happens to be the same group that loves edgy, offensive humor, which brings me to my next point.

The final and most important reason racism on reddit is so prevalent is because redditors are great at making excuses. [As it turns out, it's actually okay to say nigger because it's just for fun. And who doesn't like having fun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yja7f/retro_in_which_the_hivemind_gloats_how_superior/c5w7cbf). Humor is the reason racism is ""okay"" (I think that [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yjbqj/not_trolling_why_do_people_have_such_a_problem/) might actually be serious). Louis C.K makes racist jokes all the time, why can't I lightheartedly jest at the fact that niggers like KFC? The Chris Rock bit about there being a difference between a black person and a nigger also gets tossed around a lot. I get it. Racist jokes can be funny. But it has come to the point where people are racist just for the sake of being racist. What was previously ""ironic"" racism (see- bestof'd post) becomes real hate. The same logic that tells a neckbeard black people are uncivilized because of ebonics gave slavemasters an excuse to treat slaves as subhumans. 


Circlebroke is ToR for people who hate reddit, so this seems like the appropriate sub.

#

So, we all remember Todd Akin, the idiot congressman who said that ""legitimate rape"" never results in pregnancy.  Of course, ""republican"" congressman meant that reddit blasted this comment into the ground and used it to create an army of strawmen that would bring [Qin Shi Huang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_cotta_army) great pride in the afterlife.

Now, while Akin's comments were completely insane and showed how flawed some people's thinking is when it comes to rape and human reproduction, reddit's reaction to it was just as bad:

""Hey guise, let's make this into a rape joke!""

So on every thread, in a vain attempt to make republicans into woman hating villains, brave redditors were making rape jokes that included the word ""legitimate"".  So, once again, redditors missed the point.

#

**Part 2**

#

The Todd Akin ""legitimate rape"" joke has been bad the entire time, but today, to the tune of 1,866 net upvotes, it reached a breaking point.

[""LOL a woman doesn't make my weenie tingle""](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/10iagj/todd_akin_the_legitimate_rape_guy_has_a_wife_that/).

Top Comment:  [She's not attractive.  That's hilarious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/10iagj/todd_akin_the_legitimate_rape_guy_has_a_wife_that/c6dpvia)

Of course, the fact that reddit hates non-porn women is pretty well known, but something about this annoyed me.  I think it's the fact that the only reason why they know this guy's name is because he was insensitive to women, and now they are using his notoriety to bash his wife for simply being a woman who's not 18 and naked.

After taking *every* opportunity to bash this man because of his misogynistic comments, they are now taking *every* opportunity to use his famous comment to spread their own version of misogyny, which is more damaging, more sinister, and more prevalent than his.

#

**Part 3**

#

So now we come to a place where redditors shove their smug little faces up their own assholes and start eating their own shit.  They take the opportunity to make rape jokes about a man who they hate because he has shit opinions about rape.

1346702090.0,324,self.circlebroke,zanht,The difference between a hivemind and a circlejerk. A lesson for the uninformed and the interested.,twentyone_21,404,80,120,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/zanht/the_difference_between_a_hivemind_and_a/,"Today we will explore the proper differences between a hivemind and a circlejerk. There has been confusion lately between the two, so I wanted to set the record straight for future use.

*What is a hivemind?*  

**A hivemind is a group of people that express similar thoughts, ideals, and goals.**

*What is a circlejerk?*

**A circlejerk is a hivemind that lacks self-awareness.**

_____

Let's do some explaining:

* Semantically, a hivemind is, more or less, a singular mind with many different voices of it, like a beehive is a single colony with many bees.  
This is not a necessarily bad thing. Hiveminds can actually be good! Some examples would be a bunch of people who are activists against human trafficking donating to a charity against that also.

* On the other hand, let's dive into what a circlejerk actually is. Let's imagine that a buddy of yours invited you to a get-together with buds, and plays up how awesome these get-togethers are. He says he couldn't imagine not going to these, and how uncool you would be if you missed out. When you arrive, all you see is your friends wanking off, and you either join in on the creepy fun, or you notice how none of them realize how weird this is, and you leave their lack of self-awareness to themselves. Even if you told them that jerking off together/each other is really weird, they would tell you to just leave. They would tell you that what they are doing isn't weird, and that you and other people do weirder things.  

* There are a few points to emphasize in this analogy:  

 * As mentioned above, there is a lack of self-awareness in a circlejerk.  
 * Within this absence of self-awareness,  there no thought given to the possibility of being wrong, or even the possibility of other opinions existing.  
 * When alternate ideas are presented, these ideas are silenced and mocked.  
 * There is always a superiority complex or a ""secret club"" mentality.  
 * Repeated content is usually upvoted (i.e. going around in a circle), because the group is not self-aware.  
 * The denial that the circlejerk exists, and making accusations that other things are ""circlejerks.""
 * It is different than what was advertised.  
 * It is very cyclical (no pun intended). The more self-validation there is, the more the jerking is promoted.  
 * It is very hard to break the jerking of a circlejerk.

_____

*Comparing a Hivemind and a Circlejerk:

* As stated above, hivemind and a circlejerk both are full of likeminds.  
* A hivemind and a circlejerk can both do bad, in certain situations, such as witch hunts.  
* A hivemind and a circlejerk can both do good, such as donating to a good cause.  
* A hivemind and a circlejerk can both have superiority complexes, but how they use them is what differentiates the two.

*Contrasting a Hivemind and a Circlejerk:

* As stated above, a circlejerk is not self-aware, whereas a hivemind can be.  
* Non-circlejerk hiveminds appreciate alternate opinions, and encourage discussion about it.  
* Non-circlejerk hiveminds do not act like an exclusive group. 
* Hiveminds can easily become circlejerks without proper moderation, and it is reversible with proper moderation, yet is much more difficult.    

_____

Here are some things that encourage circlejerks, and sometimes things that circlejerks encourage:  

* Victim complexes. These will encourage the ""secret club"" mentality, as well as their tendency to silence alternate opinions.  
* Bias-strengthening. Usually this is done with poor strawmen and even fake arguments from a poorly-done ""devil's advocate"" position.  
* Low-quality content. It does nothing to help break the circlejerk.  
* Irrelevant content. Distracts regular lurkers from the problems within the community.  
* Stubbornness. Circlejerks generally do not encourage people to be free thinkers, because they teach people that alternate opinions are inferior and not worthy of consideration. Because of this stubbornness, there is a decrease of self-awareness, as they will be more likely to disregard other ideas.  
* Dislike of change. Any changes to correct the circlejerk (usually by moderation) are generally resisted in circlejerks.  
* Laissez-faire moderation. The lack of authority figures increases low-quality and irrelevant content.  
* Self-congratulation. Taking credit for insignificant or irrelevant things, along with things that cannot even be accredited to them.  
* Itself. The more self-validation and egotism presence, the bigger the circlejerk becomes.

tl;dr Not all hiveminds are circlejerks, and we should not label self-aware groups as circlejerks.",Quality Post,False,,t5_2tnz9,1346702562.0,starflair,,True,t3_zanht,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/zanht/the_difference_between_a_hivemind_and_a/,

Of course, the first red flag was this addendum to the title:

&gt;It seems a little clearer why so many followed him unconditionally.

At first I thought that might've just been a solo thing, as the top post with 5x Reddit gold is an intelligent post about remembering that Hitler is human and not a mythical creature.

Then came the Redditors we've come to know and fear.

&gt;Hitler could easily be the greatest leader of the 20th century and even a larger time frame.(Notice how i didn't say nicest or most humane). He did use his power to try and wipe off a race and obviously that isn't a good thing at all. But he came to power not by using threats, but by using promises. Not by scaring his people into obeying him, but by making his followers believe in him. His rhetorical ability and his leadership skills brought him to the level that was at back then. Once again he obviously had his negative aspects, but his leadership abilities are extremely impressive.

I mean yeah, he committed genocide, but we should remember how good a leader he was!

Then, one person posted this (true) fact about Germany, but only in a context so as to suggest that Hitler and Nazi Germany wasn't as anti-semitic as we thought.

&gt;Germany actually offered a few countries, including the US, to take the Jews in as ex-pats, and all countries refused.

Then here's a delightful gem.

&gt;Im not trying to imply Obama and Hitler are one in the same. I'm not one of those people, but you can definitely draw some connections. Both rise in power at a time when there countries are falling a part, and both are very charismatic speaker.

Oh, and:

&gt;Hope and Change. Seems like a winning combination for winning over a populace.

There are, of course, the pun threads, but we've seen all those crappy puns dozens of times, so there's no point in quoting them here.

&gt;Dear Diary, Today, I was inspired by Adolf Hitler.

Dear Diary, Today I found out I may be a Nazi

&gt;Hitler to me wasn't a monster or an evil mastermind. He wasn't very smart. His decisions were made for him. He wasn't able to kill lots of people and getting away with it, like serial-killer-monsters. I'm not even sure if he really hated jews, or if his helpers just told him that they needed to finance the war somehow.

How exactly did the systematic oppression, then genocide of minorities *save* money?

Oh, and don't forget good ol' fashion racism!

&gt;nazi-germany didnt invent the blaming of a bad financial crisis on the jews. thats actually something that happened several times before in european history.

met with

&gt;maybe its true then

Oh, and what's this? some people actually paid attention:

&gt;The description says the video is uploaded in pursuit of scientific objectivity, but the dramatic music and well-timed cuts between particularly well-spoken parts of speeches speaks otherwise.

Why did I save this for the last? Because it's the best thing here: the video's description ignored by 99% of the people on this reddit thread (who also somehow missed the uplifting music and Hitler-favouring editing of the video:

&gt;This video has been uploaded to accurately document history. No political agenda is propagandised or supported via this uploading. There is absolutely no intention of some racist Flamewar to be instigated.

&gt;Objective, clear and precise understanding of Adolf Hitler's speeches has been kept away from the world since the end of WWII. It is, especially from Jewish circles, feared that the incredibly pursuasive rhetorical skill of Adolf Hitler will inflame support for his message. It is generally accepted that the media, also owned by Jewish circles, has actively kept the viewing public from access to accurate translations of Adolf Hitler's speeches.

&gt;Eradicating every single Jew is utterly atrocious an act, damn you should you support such primitivity and inhumanity. Yet, damn anyone who keeps you away from scientific objectivity. In this case the science of History.

I should also point out that many people who notice this and blast the Youtube OP (possibly our beloved Reddit OP too) note that this guy has a picture of an Orthodox Jew for his icon and his location as Israel. I can't see an Israeli Jew posting comments like these, though:

&gt;Hitler documentary: invariably with horror music in the background.
&gt;Jew-proganda all the way baby, all the way.

&gt;I'm am Israeli. We created the Holocaust for our political and economic purposes. I've never disagreed with Hitler. He was right in his blaming Jews for the problems of Germany. Its just that his gang lost against my gang, and we have gotten immensely more powerful ever since. The greatest fear of the Jews, which is often spoken about in private, is what would happen in the world's population would revolt against our power like the Germans did, let's say, in America. We would be slaughtered.

&gt;I just wish I had an adversary that was worth dying at the hands of. Westerners are so bereft of any morals, ideals, Truth. And look at this guy talking, he is so soft and effeminate, I can just see a character like this being coaxed into submitting to anal penetration from his apparent wife whom has a strap on dildo. These warmongers are actually so weak and effeminate. Look at Obama... man... I'll go to war, but for something worth it. My testicles are embarrassed to watch these 50% gays.

* [Everyone insisting on paying a dinner bill](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16vinw/what_social_norm_do_you_not_understand/c7zqpb9).

* [Following up on job applications.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16vinw/what_social_norm_do_you_not_understand/c7zqvmt).  
After all, why should you be expected to thank an employer for granting you an interview--or God forbid, make an effort further than handing in your application and going, ""Well that's that.""  Why would an employer possibly want to hire someone who has displayed persistence in order to get a job?

* [Thank you notes](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16vinw/what_social_norm_do_you_not_understand/c7zqmtk).  
This lack of comprehension particularly bothers me.  I don't send out thank-you notes to close friends, but I definitely send them to family members, acquaintances, etc. (anyone I don't see often).  When someone has gone to the trouble to shop and buy (and sometimes ship) a gift for you, the least you could do is write a note to them.

Honestly, I have no idea how Redditors manage to have any relationships with any people in their lives.  We're talking about the bare minimum of social interaction here: **nodding.**  It seems that the ideal world for them is one in which people go about their business all day in silence, eyes fixed straight ahead--whatever you do, don't acknowledge the presence of people you know when you see them!

1357216423.0,311,self.circlebroke,15vw59,Question: Why is behaving in an antisocial manner considered introversion?,LesMisIsRelevant,366,55,138,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/15vw59/question_why_is_behaving_in_an_antisocial_manner/,"A rhetorical question, and one that deliberately chooses the term ""antisocial"" over ""asocial,"" because the latter could qualify as a normal consequence of introversion. But never, ever, is that what's discussed in threads like [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15uwpe/what_is_a_question_you_hate_being_asked/).

First, take note of the tone of someone declaring to be an introvert, as they say:

&gt;It's called being an introvert, you fuck. I'm perfectly fine in my cocoon of no visible emotion.

Two things here: first, he ends his declaration with ""you fuck."" I don't often see introverts saying or even thinking that, because (and this may come as a surprise) it's not a normal reaction to curiosity or concern. It is, however, a great indication that you, in thought and action, are probably an asshole.

Second, there's a distinct antisocial undertone to the fact that you, when explicitly and intentionally showing no visible emotion, choose to then blame the other person for being concerned or uncomfortable when you are being unemotional.

It signifies a complete lack of respect and empathy for whomever is talking to you, in more than just one way. When you look unemotional, they assume they are the cause of you being unemotional. Apathy, not hate, as they say, is the opposite of love. Strange, then, that they might themselves feel a need to get clarity on the _why_ part, isn't it?

When someone approaches them and makes them feel ""uncomfortable,"" they somehow assume they must be intentionally trying to make them uncomfortable. Never once does it cross their minds that _they_ might be making the ""extraverts"" uncomfortable by projecting complete and utter indifference and disregard. How can they be so blind to that very obvious possibility?

Then, exactly this mindset is later put forward

&gt;Social ineptitude and introversion are not the same thing. Reddit needs to learn this.

To which is replied:

&gt;I am not socially inept, [and] I know the difference.  It's annoying to be assumed that because I don't have a huge grin on my face, that I'm not having a perfectly fine time.

Bear in mind that this is the same guy who calls anyone who even remotely cares about why he's not having a huge grin on his face ""you fuck.""

He, and others with him, then actually chastise the so-called ""extraverts"" for being cheery, or happy. Not just that, they mock them for it.

And I wonder, /r/circlebroke, how often these ""non-socially handicapped"" introverts have actually considered that, since people in general like happiness more than gloom (go figure), and since people normally take over emotions, be they friendly or hostile (a nifty thing called empathy), that just the simple act of these introverts exclaiming they are not unhappy or actually smiling once in a while just for the social decency of it all could resolve this entire situation without demonizing anyone else just because they care about others in the social situations that they're in.

No, /r/circlebroke, I don't believe this is a matter of introversion. In fact, we all know it's not. I am generally introverted, my friends are generally introverted, and many of them are autistic to boot. But none of these is sufficient reason for us to despise others when they try to include us in a social situation we position ourselves in.

Introversion is an absolutely pitiful excuse for their not caring about social protocol or other people. If they genuinely cared, or were genuinely interested in other people, they definitely could bear through the horrendous pain of being approached by people that for some reason in High Heaven still want to talk to them.

Introversion is a matter of preference towards activity; it does not in any way compel you to behave like an asshole in a situation you will, as a human being, sometimes end up in. To think that, if they just cast a polite smile at some random passerby's, they could see their whole world revolve -- really, it's quite pitiable. 

In conclusion, I feel the introversion jerk of Reddit is really just a guise for social incompetence or lack of empathy. I don't see how it can be anything else. 

EDIT: Come to think... This may just be me, but doesn't it seem obvious that, when you don't express (verbally, not by being unemotional and indifferent) that you're not really interested in talking with someone, they might actually not know this? And, conversely, doesn't it figure that, as a random example, when you don't express that you _do_ want to talk to someone, they won't know about that either?

The story is actually a good example of gender discrimination/prejudice towards men, and is likely to rankle the resident posters at r/mensrights.  Although many commenters express their condolences and offer help and support, the thread is quickly hijacked by the extremist MRA's, who respond in a disturbing yet predictable matter that reveals the absolute lunacy of their ideology.

I get annoyed just as much as many of the other posters here about the typical jerks on reddit - how Amerikkka is evil, PC gamers are the master race, girls are friendzoning attention whores, etc.  However, those jerks are relatively innocuous and are just mildly annoying.  This post on /r/mensrights is extremely disturbing and I'm saddened that people actually consider murder an appropriate response to a *fucking divorce*.  The sad thing is that the OP's case actually is a good example of discrimination against men within the family courts system - but instead of leveraging this case to advocate for change in a positive manner, the posters just respond with a potpourri of reactionary pro-violence bullshit.

I've noticed that the /r/MensRights sidebar claims ""advocating for violence/illegal acts may be removed"".  Ignoring the mealy-mouthed nature of that statement (""may"" be removed?  Seems the quotes I listed weren't terrible enough to be removed), I think that says a lot about the overall nature of that subreddit if something as painfully obvious as ""don't advocate murdering people"" has to be explicitly mentioned.

EDIT: The most egregious comments have been removed; however, there's still plenty of comments currently up exhibiting the mental gymnastics extremist MRA's go through to justify murdering a woman.

*Ooooooooooh riiiiiiiiiiight*. Government intervention is only allowed if it's something that doesn't affect me or makes something I don't like go away. I'm okay with the government stepping in and forcing people to watch things I think they should watch because I already watch the Discovery Channel on a loop for 24 hours a day.

Thank you, reddit. My eyes have been opened.

12. And last but not least, I thought I'd include my own AMA: *""IAmA white convert to Islam that recently protested in London, AMAA""*. DOWNVOTED [-6] *before anyone had even asked a question*.

**Every single one of the above agrees perfectly with the trend - reddit loves Muslims, but only if you're a closet atheist/you have issues with Islam and you are close to seeing the light of atheism.**

To be more mathematical about it - there is a perfect correlation of 1.0 between ""whether the post portrays Islam in a good/bad light"" and ""whether the post is downvoted/upvoted"". That is to say, if you saw a post that portrayed Islam in a good/normal light, you could almost be certain it was downvoted. And if you see a post that portrayed Islam in a bad/evil light, you could almost be certain it was upvoted.

I could continue, but I'd rather not spend any more time analysing the reddit community. I'm sure the correlation is clear to all - not at all limited to the results above, it's simply something I have noticed over the year I've been  here.

Remember.. reddit LOVES Muslims.. *but only if you're a closet atheist who hates Islam.*

Apparently, a group of butthurt posters have been downvoting every new thread except the complaint threads. In response the mods are removing all meta threads (for and against the changes).

It all started with this thread a couple days ago:

http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1cxnfl/cispas_immunity_provision_would_allow_corporate/

At the time I read it (and probably about the time that most redditors read it) one of the top comments was:

&gt;So basically the RIAA would have free reign to hack into people's computers to look for pirated movies.

I'm sure we're all shocked to discover that the crux of reddit's opposition to CISPA is it's interference with their right to pirate games and movies. Regardless, it is a legitimate question considering that most of us have probably pirated something at some point in our lives and nobody wants anyone hacking into their computer to look for that kind of thing. It's not the question that annoys me, but the responses.

Now, if anyone had bothered to read the [*exhaustively long* 40-page bill](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr624rfs/pdf/BILLS-113hr624rfs.pdf), or even take a whole 10 seconds to skim the [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Intelligence_Sharing_and_Protection_Act), they'd find that IP theft was specifically excluded from the bill. Now, I realize that it's a lot to ask for redditors to take 30 minutes out of their days filled with video games and porn, but I hoped that someone would at least skim the wiki page before responding.

The response with the most points (around 100, I think) was:

&gt;RIAA = Music
&gt;MPAA = Movies
&gt;But yeah 

Ok, I guess not. [One redditor](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1cxnfl/cispas_immunity_provision_would_allow_corporate/c9l29xu) actually did go out of his way to post language directly from the bill, but he only got about half the number of points. More people agreed with the completely wrong answer of ""But yeah"" than the detailed, evidenced, and completely correct answer given by Harlows_Monkeys.

Stunning.

I read through CISPA once and I'll admit that I think it's a shitty bill. I haven't sat down and parsed through the language (nor do I really intend to because honestly, I just don't give a shit about it), but I generally agree with the sentiment that it shouldn't be passed. Most redditors, on the other hand, probably haven't even skimmed it, but are more than willing to ignore facts in favor of a good circlejerk. I guess we all knew this already, but I got particularly annoyed by it in this case.

And just to top everything off, the multiple front-page posts about it this morning are directing redditors to look up their elected officials, find out how they voted, and telling them to *make sure* they vote that person out of office. Never mind if a candidate aligns with your views in every other way...if he voted for CISPA, he's out and the other guy is in.

Not because I agree with him, but because my mom does and she controls the radio wherever she goes.  Most Redditors listen to Rush Limbaugh, too.  Not because they agree with him, but because they like to cherry-pick the crazy things he says and use that to brand all the Republicans in the country.

Most Redditors, too, have raging leftist hate-blinders and a stunted sense of irony.  What I mean by that is /r/politics talks about Republicans in the same manner that Rush Limbaugh talks about Democrats.  Here I have a selection of 11 quotes (I was going to go with an even 10 but ran across one that was too amazing to pass up) from Rush and /r/politics and I leave it up to you to decide who said it.  All quotes from /r/politics are from high-ranking comments, usually the top 5, in top posts.  I had to edit them a little to make them politically neutral but the message stays the same and it's remarkable how similar they are.

Here we go:

1)

&gt;Lowering tax rates to allow people to keep more of what they earn, lowering tax rates to create more jobs, more tax revenue? That's what [The Enemy] wants to dispense with. That's what [they] want to do away with. That's what's happening here, what is really the objective, and the light went off for me when I saw it. It was just this week. A number of [The Enemy] are actually suggesting this. They're trying to be intellectually honest about it, or they're *trying* to sound intellectually honest.

2)

&gt;[The Enemy] are bothered by that as much as anything in American history bothers them: The success of the [cool president] years. It's a big threat. The success of the [cool president] years was one of the biggest threats [The Enemy] ever faced, because the success of the [cool president] years demonstrated how wrong [The Enemy] are, how dangerously wrong they are. That's why there's been a constant rewriting of history ever since [cool president] left office, and even while he was in office.

3)

&gt;It's very easy to undermine [The Enemy] because their entire platform is nothing but trendy talking point, most of which you could convince [Reasonable People] to go along with thus destroying all their leverage. 

4)

&gt;[The Enemy] has had a decades-long slippery definition of ""small business"" that's been used to jerry rig statistics and to bait-and-switch their base about whose interests their really protecting.

5)

&gt;Because [The Enemy] just can't help themselves. It's part of their dogma, which is the real political problem in this country - [Stupid Ideas], as practiced by [The Enemy], more closely resembles a religion than a political ideology.

6)

&gt;There was no democratic uprising.  It was the Muslim Brotherhood uprising.  It was an Islamic supremacist uprising.  There was nothing democratic about it.  There was no democracy.  There was no liberty and freedom as we understand it.

7)

&gt;The Muslim mentality is not of peace and understanding, it the return to the dark ages of the rule of the Calif. Their mentality is ruled by fear, they are afraid of their women, opinion and the outside world.

8)

&gt;Power equals wealth, or translates to wealth. It's a closed club. It's a very small bunch of people, in truth, compared to the population. The way you get into this club is usually via your university or your family legacy, family name, what have you.  Once you're in the club, the objective is to keep everybody else out of it. You don't want the club to grow. You don't want the clique getting bigger, and one of the quickest ways to keep people from becoming powerful is to make sure they don't become wealthy.

9)

&gt;[The Enemy] economic agenda in 11 words : ""Take from the middle, give to the rich, blame the poor.""

10)

&gt;I find it really stunning. We are going backwards in this country. We are separating people by class. We are separating people by race. We are not encouraging people to do better. We are not inspiring people to be the best they can be. We are essentially acknowledging that people are not very good and don't have much hope. Well, not ""we."" [The Enemy] are thriving by telling their voters who they ought to hate, who they ought to oppose, who they ought to try to eliminate, wipe out, in a political sense, and it's all based on race or other forms of ethnicity.

11)

&gt;Between their fiscal agenda mentioned here, their social agenda taking away well established rights, and the fact that they openly plan to gerrymander a win in 2016, I am more and more of the mind that [The Enemy] is the greatest threat, foreign or domestic, this country has ever faced.

Comment thread is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/yi6ow/more_work_gets_done_in_four_days_than_in_five_and/).

Basically, a guy running a tech company switches to a 4 day week for part of the year and says he found that ""better work gets done in four days than in five.""  The TrueReddit submitter then changes this qualified anecdote to a simple declaration that ""**More** work gets done in four days than in five. And often the work is better"" (which is a very different, far less universal claim).  At that point, it's time to go to town.

The top comment wastes absolutely no time:

&gt;&gt;[Since when have corporations taken into account the human element of what they do? It's always been way more about control than about implementing ideas and plans that would increase employee productivity and improve morale, mood, etc.  Companies have shown for well over a decade that the 4-day work week increases productivity and is good for morale. But you know America: ""Goddammit, if you ain't workin' 70 hours per week without lunch breaks, you're a parasite on the system""  In America, the corporate motto is ""Work harder. A lot harder. Not smarter.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/yi6ow/more_work_gets_done_in_four_days_than_in_five_and/c5vu5ns)

In other words, companies really don't care about, you know, making money or being more efficient (as any eKKKonomist will tell you).  No, evidently the whole reason that corporations exist is to _control_ you, what with all their rules and requirements.  Just like your parents.

But once the catnip of ""blame this on America"" has been scented, then there's really no resisting the follow-up.  Before reading this, you can probably close your eyes and imagine, almost word-for-word, what a magical European has to say about it:

&gt;&gt;[A lot of more enlightened companies in Europe implement this or similar. I was lucky enough to work for one of them. To have long weekends off is lifechanging. It makes you actually care more about work and doing a good job, as well as totally shifting the work-life balance. But it is a bit of a one-way road for companies. We got a new CEO (American) who hated the short weeks so revoked them. He lost a lot of his workforce in a year and gained nothing in productivity.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/yi6ow/more_work_gets_done_in_four_days_than_in_five_and/c5vvlb1)

Well, that settles it.  I'm one anecdote away from being completely Swedish myself.

Farther down the page and rather less popular, someone makes a perfectly valid point:

&gt;&gt;[Why doesn't the author make it a 4day work week all year round if it's so productive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/yi6ow/more_work_gets_done_in_four_days_than_in_five_and/c5vtmzs)

Another commenter gives a little more color:

&gt;&gt;[Jason Fried has been writing articles and giving talks like this one for years. I think mostly it's to try to be a little outrageous and draw interest / talent to his company.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/yi6ow/more_work_gets_done_in_four_days_than_in_five_and/c5vuc4n)

I'm glad the the skeptical voices haven't been completely drowned out, but any long-time subscribers to TrueReddit have to be disappointed that ridiculous, college-freshman level jerkbait is now rising to the top and crowding out what used to be one of the better communities around here.  This process has been going on a long time, and the mod - the **only** mod, since she refuses to take on any others - has been adamant that she will do absolutely no modding whatsoever.  Though she's admitted once or twice to a decline in quality, she states over and over again that she expects the community to police itself, and to simply call out and downvote bad submissions.

This has never worked.  Ever.  TrueReddit is gradually liquefying into a gooey, spongy RSS feed of Glenn Greenwald articles (which are regularly cross posted from /r/politics) and, well, low-content jerkbait like this.

In sum, TrueReddit reads like an Aesop's Fable for the necessity of active mod involvement.  Both AskScience and Circlebroke benefit tremendously from active mod involvement and our collective hats go off to their entirely voluntary efforts to keep these communities good.

Because, as experience has shown, we simply cannot trust ourselves.

Much like their tendency to play art critic (See: ""this is modern art therefore it's bad the only true art is those cool crayon paintings where you melt the wax amirite""), reddit also loves to heap praise on any teenager with a thesaurus. For example, after some incredibly fake story about kicking a friendzoning bitch in her friendzoning face, written with cringe-inducing synonyms and seven syllable words, redditors will gush such le gems as:

&gt;That...you could be a writer...

Anddd downvoted, you pretentious critic. Shouldn't have tried to diss the neckbeard's favorite book after The God Delusion-a thesaurus.

So, shall we take a look at the story which spawned this sickening display of ignorance of good writing? Here's an excerpt, as the whole story may be a bit too much for the frail circlebroker's constitution:

&gt;My legs finally gave out as she started speaking in tongues, at which point I slumped forward and accidentally introduced the next thirty percent of my woody pal into her quivering innards, causing my five-foot fuck-friend to emit a yelp that implied that I'd skewered her internal organs like a kebab. She instinctively performed an evasive barrel roll to her right, bending my instrument in such a manner as to cause an audible pop. I mirrored her movements so as not to see my trusty chap ripped off like a raffle ticket and ended up tumbling dongwards onto the floor, my coital partner following shortly thereafter.

Ah, a perfect storm of redditors' favorite things. Sex, made up stories, needless embellishments, and classic phrases such as ""my coital partner"". This man is truly the Hemingway of our time. Oh wait, no he's not, because Hemingway was a fantastic writer who understand that powerful yet simple language is often the most beautiful and effective way to communicate a story.

I typically console myself following minor mishaps with the thought that they'll prove to be worth it for the story, and so your mirth validates my suffering.

Just...unbelievable.


**Edit**: As an aside, I just found this sweet comment, a reaction to BrooklynNet's aforementioned story:

&gt;My brain reacted to the story as if it was a book. I visualized it and everything.

Such talent. This man rises above the plebian mob to actually *imagine a story in his head*. I can only dream of accomplishing such an intellectual feat.

**Edit 2**: I should clarify that I'm not against detailed/flowery language, *when it's used well*. Often, even redditors are able to use this kind of diction effectively as a contrast to the crude content of their story. However, this is a ridiculously exaggerated case that does *not* do that effectively.

I'm not sure how this guy missed it, but right in the abstract they say that the cells could differentiate into functional derivatives of the ectodermal germ layer (that's what neurons come from, so the paper says that precursors to neurons were derived).

What a very glib response, and it's at the top!  The article is unfortunately inaccessible to me, but I can in good faith say that Nature is not going to publish a study that has participants eating twinkies in the breakroom and not controlling for the effect it has on mood.  Seriously, in what world would such an obvious methodological problem be missed by the dozen phds that peer reviewed this?

I could go on and on and find more examples.  These were all upvoted and near the top.  I am all for questioning scientific papers and discoveries, but you honestly can't unless you are able to critically read what is written, and that requires a solid scientific background.  This sounds elitist but I believe it's true.  The assumption in most of the contrary opinions is that researchers = dummies, and apparently everyone who peer reviewed these articles was too, along with the editors of some very high profile, prestigious journals.

I’m what some people might call a ""geek"" or ""nerd."" Depending on who you ask, those words have vastly different meanings. To be honest, the people who debate the differences are exactly the sort of people I'm going to rant about. 

It can certainly be said that there has been a major societal shift in how people perceive nerds, geeks, and what have you. There's of course the absurd 80s high school movie version, where football jocks dominate the social hierarchy and nerds creep by under the radar to prevent being serially bullied (which is apparenly funny for some reason?). I have always despised this idea, because it is totally unrealistic. I am not saying bullying doesn't occur; it does. What I am saying is that the way in which it occurs is entirely different from the way most people imagining it as happening. There are instances where people are bullied for downright horrible reasons, and even when they aren't, no one deserves to be bullied. That being said, the people who tended to be shunned, in my experience, were those who exhibited attention-seeking and antisocial (note that antisocial means socially inappropriate, not asocial) behavior. I have never witnessed the ubiquitous anti-intellectualism that the hivemind claims to exist. 

The problem I speak of is the conflation of things which are arbitrarily associated with bookishness, with intellectuality. This came about because the general public noticed a loose correlation between certain hobbies and certain professions which are stereotypically reserved for those who are smart. The people involved in the hobbies have latched onto this, and used it to their advantage to make themselves appear as highly intelligent when they have done nothing to warrant this.

I'm a rather introverted person, who happens to be planning on pursuing an academic career in physics. I don't consider myself to be a genius by any means, but my personality fits into the archetype of ""smart."" This is distinct from intellect. I am referring to that type of person which people think of, when they think of intelligent. The fact is, I have known incredibly intelligent people from all backgrounds who certainly do not fit into this category. Moreover, I have a lot of highly specific interests in relatively mundane areas, and several sort of quirks that might strike people as odd. All in all, I would consider the set of aspects which compose my identity as incidental. 

The social problem I have always had is not being bullied or belittled for being interested in science, but rather in being pigeonholed into a group which I absolutely deplore: geeks. What is a geek? A geek, superficially, sounds similar to myself (and others like me). It is someone with a set of very focused interests which have a significant effect on their day to day lives. The critical difference between whatever one might call me, and geeks, is that geeky interests are devoid of any intellectual merit. Now before I go on, I don't mean to sound elitist. There are plently of people with intellectually fruitful interests. All I am saying is that my sort of personality tends to be lumped in with a geeky personality. So, just to give examples, let's compare geeky and non-geeky hobbies. A good example of a non-geeky hobby would be something like being involved in amateur radio. I'm not a ham, but I know some people who are. Amateur radio requires (by law, actually, since you have to pass a test to get your license) proficiency and detailed knowledge of RF communications. Hams are also often highly interested in the history of radio. In addition, learning the practical details of operating a radio tends to segway into learning more about the physics behind how their equipment operates. Now, let me give an example a of geeky hobby: video games. I don't mean to say that people who play video games are bad. I like video games, but they are not a lifestyle for me. The difference between ham radio and video games as lifestyles are that the latter does not impart genuine, intellectual knowledge. While video game development is a mentally rigorous endeavor, the amount of videogamers who become video game programmers is negligible. 

People on reddit love to tout themselves are superior to the unwashed masses, when in reality they are just as bad, if not worse. Justin Bieber or Zelda, Fifty Shades of Grey or Harry Potter. My tastes in recreation do not resemble what the average person likes, but I don't think myself better for that. 

So why am I ranting? What bothers me, is that I feel like recognition I work for has been stolen from under me. The thing is, I hate comic books. I hate superheroes. I hate 99% of science fiction. I don't care in the slightest about Queen, or whatever other music the hivemind likes. I don't find ""nerdy"" humour, that requires all of a wikipedia page to ""get,"" funny in the slightest. I hate anime. I think RPGs are almost entirely composed of trite, horrible, cliche storylines. I think Joss Whedon is a hack, and that Firefly has subpar acting and a half-assed premise that makes absolutely zero sense. I think Game of Thrones is glorified pornography with a bunch of superficially ""complex"" plot lines are overwrought language so neckbeards can get off and feel superior at the same time. I hate people whose knowledge of physics come from Star Trek who spam science blogs about ""ramping up production of carbon metamaterials."" I think transhumanism is pseudo-scientific nonsense that is nothing more than a surrogate for the rapture for internet atheists. I take pride in being presentable (i.e. not having cheetos dust on my fingers) and hygiene.

Redditors fancy themselves scientists, but they don't want to do the work. You know what? Learnings physics, or math: it's a *ton* of work. It's not being weird for the sake of being weird, or bragging about your 140 IQ you got from an online test. It's not being a facebook warrior against fundie friendzoners. It's *definitely* not getting high on marijuana. I spend my time pouring through books that are, I'll be honest, boring as hell most of the time. Sometime I have to read a paragraph 20 times before I have any idea what's even going on. The great physicist Richard Feynman said this in reference specifically to quantum mechanics, but I think it also applies more generally: if you think you understand science, you don't understand science. I question whether this is what I want to do nearly every day. I keep on, because it's worth it all for those brief, fleeting moments when you ""get it."" Redditors don't ""get it,"" and likely never will. They watch videos of NDT or Carl Sagan, skim wikipedia for 20 minutes and then think they've come to some interesting conclusions. Scientists, real ones, don't sit around talking about they're so much better than Christians and how they're going to do X thing for science because science is cool. Do redditors know what special unitary groups are? Can they give a brief overview of Yangs-Mill Theory? Unlike redditors, I don't care if someone can't namedrop random things. (""You don't know what the Higgs Boson is? Zomg stupid fundie!"" ""Well, what is it?"" ""Uhhh. . .) However, don't pretend to be something you don't deserve to be. And I'm not even saying scientists are better. Being a scientist is just another profession. No actual scientist I've ever met looks down on, or cares about people who like pop culture, or who aren't personally interested in their field of study. And every scientist I know has utmost respect for anyone with good work ethic.

&gt;Arabs are in a constant state of humiliation.
They used to have influential, great empires that kept science and learning alive during the dark ages. Now they live in dictatorships and theocracies and live in ignorance and shame compared to their ancestors. Meanwhile their political and religious leaders blame the US and Israel to prevent the masses from seeing where the problem actually lies.

And how does Reddit respond? By upvoting psuedo-history:

If your knowledge of Middle East history is limited to the Ottomans and the Persian Empires, you have little knowledge, like that poster above. The Arabs built two Caliphates that ruled the region for centuries: the [Umayyads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate) and the [Abbasids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate), as well as several smaller groups who achieved quite impressive feats (the Moors, for example).

It goes on and on. You could fill pages with the bullshit from that thread. What makes it especially annoying that the link wasn't to some news story, it was to a quality article than everybody seemed to ignore.

Take this post for instance:

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10xex9/reddit_as_a_black_man_who_wants_to_be_part_of/

For a little while it broke just over a 1000 net upvotes, but quickly was reigned in and eventually the person deleted their account. The mod of askreddit, ImNotJesus, tries to brush it off with some simplistic statements basically saying 'oh that is just the way it is'. My [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10xex9/reddit_as_a_black_man_who_wants_to_be_part_of/c6hht0j?context=3) to them explores some real issues that may be contributing to the racist environment reddit fosters, which they didn't address, and didn't respond to. Now in my comment there is a great video about White Privilege that I think every person should watch.

Why would reddit highly upvote something about black people confirming stereotypes, but when it comes to their own racist stereotypes, they don't really care? Well that video explains in very easy to digest ideas, that we don't care because we don't have to deal with it every day. We don't care because we don't have to. The reality of what others go through in life or have to face isn't our reality, in this sense we are privileged because we don't have to experience racial prejudice both in the real world or online.

How does this fit together with /r/creepyPMs?

Well, it's essentially the same thing. Privilege. It keeps young men from seeing what it's like for a woman on the internet and the issues she has to face. Both offline and online. So in every post in /r/creepyPMs we will have someone saying that 'this isn't creepy' or the person is just too sensitive. That the guy who sent the creepy PM is just shy, socially awkward, or whatever other excuse confirms their biased outlook on the world. Yet when a woman did the same thing back, they were batshit crazy. Don't stick your dick in that. Whoa boy! You sure dodged a bullet. The sentiment that there was nothing wrong with these creeps got so bad that a small portion of the users started fighting back against people posting content for us. 

They were bitches, sluts, whores. Their posting history raided, links to their pictures posted. If they posted on /r/gonewild, they should have known better. If they posted in /r/amiugly they deserved to get these creepy messages because it comes with the territory of compliments. I created a rule, rule 7 which asks that any questioning if something is creepy be explored on another subreddit. A small group of people were extremely offended that their opinion wasn't valued, that mindlessly saying something isn't creepy doesn't really add any value to our subreddit.

Take a look through some of the posts there. It has gotten a little better over the past month, but it's starting to regress again. We have 10 comments saying the same thing. The bravery level is off the charts. Men love it when other men have the 'balls' to stick it to these horrible women that don't find their creepy advances to be alluring, endearing, or attractive. They get upvoted, and highly! 

Some guy offers you money for your used underwear, pictures of your feet, or to have sex with you? Wicked! Sign me up! Why can't I get asked for that? Women have life so easy! They just get everything handed to them! 

This speaks to the dynamic in which reddit interacts with people different than them. For women, we love them, and we hate them in the same breath. We want to see them naked, and then we want to have power over them by telling them how disgusting, slutty, whorish, and wrong they are for being sexually liberated. We in essence despise ourselves for being so attracted to women, and instead of exploring this disgust, we project it onto the women.

Suddenly karma becomes more important than human relationships. People are trying to trick us or brainwash us into giving them karma, operating off of our primal instincts. Black peoples problems are not our problems because we don't see it. 'Female' problems are not our problems, because we don't deal with it. Because we can't see, experience, or feel it, it isn't real to us. The only thing real to us is our confirmation bias and anything that affirms it.

This is why it's so easy for people on reddit to identify with being oppressed when it focuses on something that they have experienced. Oppressed or stereotyped against because you are atheist? Those horrible people don't know how hard we have it! Muslims oppressed because of xenophobia? Religious extremists! It's easy to see why oppression can affect us, and how it can affect us, but that's as far as our empathy can extend. Right to the end of our own noses. For others who face equally or worse oppression, it simply can't be digested by us because we have no reference for it. We could look past our own nose and see the similarities in various forms of oppression, but that would mean looking outside our bubble of a world view and questioning ideas and views we have held to be true and have been cemented in our minds by our peers who agree with us. 

So that black man post in askreddit? No one can adequately explain why reddit is as racist as it is because from our perspective we don't see it as racist. We see it as a psychological issue, a demographics issue, a humor issue. Maybe we can blame the first response being from a mod trying to paint the nicest picture possible of the community, but the rest of the comments aren't much better. 

The posts in /r/creepyPMs when we don't see them as conforming to our exact ideas of creepy? No one can adequately understand how the other person feels, because being young men we have no idea what it might be like to have our self worth intrinsically tied to our sexuality. We feel sorry for the guys, because who hasn't been in that position in one point in their lives? I know I have, but I haven't let it completely warp my views on life. 

To redditors, there is nothing wrong with subreddits that are horrible, that are promoting racism, sexism, or anything else because of free speech. But do you honestly think this free speech would extend to a subreddit that was fighting against something they were passionate about? What if industry and government created a PRO SOPA subreddit, and spread their message to the rest of reddit. Would we be fighting as hard for this free speech? I hardly think so. We fight for free speech, for rights, for issues to be visible and discussed only because they are something important to us. When we see no importance in an issue, it becomes meaningless. It becomes insignificant. Sometimes we will even take up arms against it because we don't understand it. Our complete lack of passion is the driving force to maintain our confirmation bias. For some people, this fight and their ideas are the only things they have. To shatter them would mean they would completely need to re-evaluate their lives, their ideas, their upbringing, and learn to question against the majority of their peers. 

It would require individuality, it would require critical thinking, and it would require seeing outside of the box. Why do this, when it's easier believing in what we always have believed in. Because it's safe, it's comfortable, and it doesn't require any work on our part. Reddit and other sources of peer supported false realities makes people lazy, it makes them resort to comfortable ideas, and it keeps them from waking up to the world around them. 

This is why certain posts make it to the front page, certain types of ideas in comments always at the top, and posts or comments that they can't understand stay on the back burner. The next time you see a man being oppressed by something, or singled out because of their gender, or poor young white men being disillusioned being on the front page, you know there is some other important issue that will never fully receive the visibility it desires because to the main demographics of reddit, it doesn't matter.

So why then, when these issues do inevitably come up, do we brush them aside, easily explain away the issue, or turn it back on the other person? It removes responsibility. Reddit isn't racist if that's just how basic psychology works. Men aren't creepy if the woman was baiting them in with their pictures or using our sexuality against us. It removes putting the responsibility on the people it should be on. It removes personal responsibility, something no one will want to deal with as long as there is a scapegoat to pass the buck onto.

1374104232.0,270,self.circlebroke,1iisx4,An Explanation of how /r/adviceanimals got to be so terrible,LeMayMayPoster,310,40,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1iisx4/an_explanation_of_how_radviceanimals_got_to_be_so/,"Hi, I'm Dr. LeMayMayPoster, professor of memetics (a totally real science). Let's have a look at /r/adviceanimals. 

Advice Animals, in general, are a spinoff of the ""Advice Dog"" meme, which first appeared on the Internet in 2006. There was never one ""right way"" to do them, but most versions of the meme involved juxtaposing incredibly terrible advice with the picture of a smiling dog. Many earlier spinoffs, like Courage Wolf, followed a similar pattern. By the way, this is why they're called Advice Animals--they actually involved some sort of advice. You can spot an attempt to revitalize this idea with Actual Advice Mallard, although it fails at giving ridiculous advice. By contrast, Malicious Advice Mallard is actually quite similar to early Advice Animals. So as you can see, no Advice Animals concept ever just goes away--but they do become less prominent.

Let's end by looking at an Advice Animal from this era:

http://imgur.com/XCO9Ex6

This first era lasted from 2006 to 2010, give or take. /r/adviceanimals itself was founded in late 2010, at which point Reddit began to take an active hand in shaping the meme. Many of the memes mentioned below originated on Reddit.

Here's where we hit what I think of as the second wave of Advice Animals. This wave can be divided into two distinct camps. The main thing they had in common was a disregard for ""advice,"" once part of the meme's definition. At this point, many took to calling them image macros, as the use of both advice and animals declined.

Let's dub one of these camps the Rage Revolution. This is where, as rage comics became less popular, less new and relevant, they migrated to image macro form. RR-era macros are distinct in that they could easily be rewritten as rage comics. Scumbag Steve, Socially Awkward Penguin, and so forth fit into this category. Additionally, some macros of this era actually depict rage comic characters, like the Forever Alone Guy. Overall, RR-era macros are used to share stories from a person's life. This may include something they did, someone they encountered, and so on. This movement began in 2010 or so, and is arguably still continuing. It also contains traces of the present-day third wave, in that some RR macros explain a person's opinion--Scumbag _____ could easily stand in for a strawman, instead of an actual interaction the person had. And some RR-era macros are essentially ""Hey, look at this asshole!"" or ""This is how to be a Good Guy/Good Girl, take note!""

Let's look at a Rage Revolution macro:

http://imgur.com/FPJUENL

Concurrent with the Rage Revolution were the XD SO RANDOM Syncretists, a related but distinct group. They championed the idea that anything could be an Advice Animal, or ""meme"" as some took to calling them (they are memes, but not all memes are image macros). It was their belief that putting Impact text on any type of joke or message made it a proper Advice Animal. This allowed anything to be rendered in the image macro format. This era's explanation is simple--for example, a single anti-joke might not far on /r/funny, but slap a chicken on it and it's an Advice Animal. This movement retained the XD SO RANDOMness of the original Advice Animal concept, while expanding its scope so that actual advice was no longer necessary, actual animals were no longer necessary, and a fixed format was no longer necessary, beyond the text style. This movement is ultimately responsible for shitty posts like ""Edward Snowden with Impact text about fighting tyranny"" and so on--because of the idea that anything can be an Advice Animal. However, even the XD SO RANDOM syncretists would balk at the third wave, which began to abandon humor entirely.

But first, let's look at a Syncretist macro:

http://imgur.com/kVy72nP

Neither of those two macro types have completely faded from use, and they were still quite common until recently. On Reddit they have now been eclipsed by a new, insidious movement, which began some late in 2011 and came to maximum prominence by 2012. This is the Brave Wave. Examples include Confession Bear, Grinds My Gears, Pepperidge Farm Remembers, Am I the Only One, Sudden Clarity Clarence, Morpheus, and so on. These retain and expand upon the personal opinions of the Rage Revolution, while borrowing the XD SO RANDOM Syncretists' broad view of the Advice Animals concept. They all express this basic message: ""I have an important opinion, you guys!"" This is when /r/adviceanimals became a complete cesspool.

This is also when it abandoned the actual structure of Advice Animals. By the Syncretists' reckoning, it counted as long as it had a picture, and some Impact text divided into two. Setup and payoff. This is most noticeable in memes like Successful Black Guy. Brave Wave-era macros, by contrast, are often divided arbitrarily. There is often no buildup of expectations, no unexpected payoff or expansion of the first section. Literally the only thing making it an Advice Animal is the familiar, repeated format. For example, in a ""Grinds My Gears"" post, the only humor is in ""Heh, I recognize that,"" or ""Heh, Family Guy.""

Here's our last analysis, from this week in the Brave Wave:

http://imgur.com/SBDE7CD

So why did Reddit's /r/adviceanimals sub evolve this way? Multiple reasons, but here's the most cynical. It's hard to jerk over random, humorously bad advice, easier to jerk over anecdotes and jokes, and *very* easy to jerk about opinions.

&gt;This is important: sometimes people just have to hear the truth for it to grip them. Some people are intransigent, and refuse to change their minds no matter what--but some people are just uninformed, or haven't thought clearly about things. I ran into a guy I know recently, a super-conservative fundamentalist with a mail-order bride. Everything she ""knows"" about American politics comes from her hubby and Fox ""News."" We had an hour-long talk about politics, and, at the end of it, she turns to him and says, roughly: ""You're always saying that liberals are all crazy, but this guy is reasonable and makes a lot of sense."" Basically the instant she heard the real, sensible (and non-dogmatic) liberal side of things laid out for her, she saw that it was at least a contender for the truth, and she seemed to realize that she'd only been exposed to a straw man up until that point.

**Now, this post in particular is laughable for a few reasons.  a.) The criticism of people who only watch Fox News (which is a rubbish source) on a subreddit whose front page is always overflowing with links to Politicus.com, Salon.com, ThinkProgress.org, alternet.org, MSNBC.com and so many more is astonishing.  b.) the story just seems fake, like the brave atheist warrior buying Mountain Dew in Wal-Mart fake.  c.)

&gt;Love this. I'm British and I've always had an interest in American politics. The DNC conference made me want to become an American citizen just to vote for the democrats. Bill's speech was fantastic. The American people shouldn't criticise Obama for not ending the recession fast enough. These things take time, but they are heading in the right direction. The Republicans would destroy all that hard work and progress. Americans of Reddit... Vote Obama on my behalf, as I cannot! +64

&gt;Similarly, my dad owned a small business for many years. He was a pretty devout Republican for most of my life. After four years of W. Bush, both he and my mom became disgusted with them and has voted for Kerry and Obama. In fact, the Bush administration could probably be attributed to having my mom and dad lose their religious faith too.
That administration can also be attributed to my dad not being able to sustain his business and having to find a new route in life. +32

**Seriously, it's like r/politics has a fill in the blank form on their front page for guaranteed karma and upvotes.  No discussion, no dissenting opinions, no thought provoking conversations, just sweet, sweet karma farming.  It goes something like this:**

**At least it's quick and efficient...**

You know what I'm sick of? Know-it-all college student types. If you've been to college, or have taken a tour of one, I'm sure you're familiar with the shtick they all have: ""Our students love having intellectual conversations, you can find someone who wants to talk about ANYTHING!"" Blah. Blah. Blah. While this was touted as some sort of triumph, what I found actually existed were nauseatingly stupid, insufferable, and uninformed children taking turns giving monologues on stuff they had memorized for their own daily dose of self-aggrandizement. Stuff that they thought, in the 10 minutes they actually considered it, they had come to novel conclusions over. If it were just that, while still annoying, the problem would have been less severe. But no. The sickening part, in my opinion, was how *ridiculously* repetitive it was. If you've read r/politics, r/atheism, or any of its ilk, you already know what I'm referring to. Some might say I am biased, that I was looking for examples to confirm my theory. On the contrary, I am not suggesting that there were none, I just didn't ever meet any. (Incidentally, nor I am implicating myself as an example thereof, I'm just as dumb as the next average joe, I just don't pretend to be anything more.) You know why? For exactly that reason. A true physicist (or mathematician, or biologist, or sociologist, or whatever, it doesn't matter) does physics. A pseudo-physicist talks about it. Now of course, they aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, of course you can talk *and* do, but by and large, someone who has to constantly talk about their own ideas, with the underlying pretension that whatever they have to say is worth hearing, probably is not. ""Some people speak because they have something to say, others because they have to say something."" The (actual) physicist, Richard Feynman, famously stated, ""If you think you understand Quantum Theory, you don't understand Quantum Theory."" While this sounds pessimistics, I think people often miss the point. Feynman has a great speech where he talks about his problems with lack in academic rigour in certain areas. In essence, what he was saying is that in physics, which is the most fundamental of all the physical sciences, is still plagued with uncertainty, thus it is arrogant to speak with such confidence in anything, if those who study the very fabric of nature cannot even do so themselves. Feynman clearly knew what he was talking about, he won the Nobel Prize, and yet he understood enough to know all that he *didn't* understand. So when I hear people on Reddit or on a college campus dropping internet-cobbled soundbytes and factoids, it makes me irritated. Not just because it's dumb. Not just because it's intellectually bankrupt. Because it is appropriating something meaningful into a barely recognized bastard of half-truths for his or her own capricious intents. But you see, it isn't merely that, in an effort to paint themselves as Renaissance men and women, *everything* must become intellectual. No longer is marijuana merely recreation, it is spirital enlightment or some other tripe. No longer is pathological promiscuity (I am not trying to slut-shame, rather I have found that there is and was a general sentiment that the mere concept of one reserving one's sexual activity is obviously absurd) entertainment, it is resistance against ""backwards socio-religious puritan values which are trying to oppress people from expressing their sexuality,"" (incidentally, why does it always ""expressing [one's] sexuality?"" isn't that just called ""sex?"" seems like an attempt to make something out to be more than it is.) and those, by the way, are not my words. No longer is drinking a diversion, it is breaking through the societally mandated inhibitions that we have. I could go on, but you get the idea. These concepts are bad in college, but Reddit, in particular, is *rife* with them. 

I'll get to thread that prompted this in a minute, but let me take a moment to address a particular circlejerk that annoys me to no end: ""I'm smart because I read books, and no one else does these days."" First of all, I am highly skeptical of the claim that your choice in entertainment is somehow indicative of your intelligence, and this is by no means limited just to books. Guess what? Because you watch Discovery or don't watch TLC, you're STILL not a scientist. You're still average. But the books one is particularly enraging, because it's just so full of self-importance. Moreover, the books in question are never intellectually challenging. I'm sorry, but Ender's Game is not great literature. It is a novel for young adults/teenagers (it's also filled to the hilt with flat, one-dimensional characters and mary sues, but that's another story). And there's nothing wrong with that! But, and this is a big but, it doesn't make you smart! Hell, reading actual great literature doesn't make you smart! Reading extended universe Star Wars or Star Trek novels *definitely* isn't great literature. The people I knew in school and beyond who were making big deals about this kind of stuff somehow also had horrible taste in fiction. Oh and, also, the same goes for pop science books, reading those don't make you smart either. I, obviously, think education is important. But mis-education is worse than no-education. I see no reason why science should be falsified to make it appeal to more people, because if you're changing it, then you're not really teaching science anymore are you? I'm not a fan of dubious metaphors, or laymen's descriptions of they change the meaning, and more than often they do. The thing is, most things *are* complex. This is just a fact.

Now, onto the thread of the hour. I usually know better than to go to askreddit, and especially to click these type threads, but unfortunately, I capitulated and gave into my own masochism. ""What is the biggest mindfuck you have ever experience?"" Yike. Should have know better indeed. 

So let's start why don't we!

This comment was a reply to a post about a phenomenon related to pi. This is pretty run of the mill for reddit, but it still irritates me. It's not that I find it offensive, it's only offensive insofar as is it insults be intelligence by presuming to be funny. And yet, it now has a score of +1824. It's all there folks, offensive username, all caps, complete derailing. People want to ask how we fix reddit? We don't. The score shows that a net of 1824 people who saw that comment thought it should be commended. You fix reddit by getting rid of reddit.

[This](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c5n1l) in itself, was not so bad, although the wording annoyed me with the whole ""woah space is like big, man"" kind of attitude. However, it started a chain of an utter clusterfuck of circlejerk. [This](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c6jgd) guy for example, was awarded Reddit gold for the courageous act of. . .posting a link? That and all the upvotes. I won't bother reposting all the child comments, you can read them if you are so inclined. I just find this whole ""sense of wonder"" bullshit annoying. Cynical? Perhaps. But in my opinion it's an excuse for not doing, you know, actual work. It's a way to sound smart without actually being smart. Why actually go to the work of being a scientist when you can just say ""the universe is liek sssssooooooo big!"" and call it a day?

Now [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c5drd) comment struck a nerve with me because it, and its replies are so full of shit. Undoubtedly, yes, technology has come a long way, but the whole ""Singularity"" is a bunch of techno-spiritual, pseudo-scientific crankery with some fancy sounding words and bold, big, and vague predictions that are both very broad and very meaningless. It is more or less tantamount to a rapture for neckbeards (gOD help us all). Take for example, this claim that, [""The fact that tech grows exponentially means we're gonna see a lot of cool shit in our lifetime.""](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c680d) Oh really? Says who. Funny, I don't remember ever learing that ""fact"" in Economics. Did Kurzweil say this? Because he also doesn't understand how evolution works and makes more teleological fallacies than any creationist has. That may be bad, but this little [shitstain](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c9imu) MAKES ME FUCKING ANGRY. Oh. my. God. I'm sorry, it just *really* gets me when I hear people say this. Mostly because it's SHIT. Having le computors is NOT a surrogate for learning actual math. To understand, you must do. You know how you learn calculus? You do it. It's boring, it sucks, but you suffer through. You give up a few hours of video games and cheetos, and you go to school without falling asleep, and you JUST DO THE WORK. If it works so well, why aren't more sci[ent]ists here getting Nobel Prizes? Oh, that's right, because it doesn't. Because people who actually, and this may come as a shock, have experience, probably know a bit more than John X. Neckbeard on Reddit. Ha! Just kidding, we clearly have a regular Einstein here (on a related note, I swear to God if I here ""Einstein failed math"" one more time I am going to punch the next person I see square in the jaw). There's also a bunch of anti-Texas Instruments circlejerking, and misunderstanding of how radiation-hardened electronics work. It amazes me that these so called geniuses don't understand why having the most powerful CPU on the Mars Rover is not priority number one. But hey? What do they know, I mean, they're only actual engineers, with actual jobs, at an actual institution. On that note, ""Moore's Law"" is something I never want to hear again. First of all because it's not a law, and second of all Gordon Moore regretted ever saying it, and third of all it hasn't even held true. I'm sorry, I just fucking hate the singularity, and all its mouth-breathing proponents who know shit about actual science. Take your pseudo-religion somewhere else (and I mean no disrespect to actual religions). But if we're talking about religion, [one](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c997k) commenter bravely welcomes the day when religion will finally die, because that will mean we will have progressed. So there's that.

Seeing [Fight Club](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c6d83) make an appearance just made me laugh because it was only a matter of time. Fight Club is, and forever will be, the conversation fodder *du jour* for pseudo-intellectuals. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but the whole ""screw the man, man!"" thing is so overplayed, and just so adolescent. It's about insanity, not whatever bullshit anti-consumerist message you managed to get out of it. There is, in fiction, a thing called an unreliable narrator, and I can't think of anyone who fits that label better than Ed Norton's character.

The drugs circlejerk is also really annoying. As I mentioned earlier, there is a whole lot of bullshit circulating around reddit. The obvious ones we know, marijuana is harmless, perfect, etc. But there are some which are more obscure. One in particular that gets me is the idiocy that LSD trips have any epistomological meaning. Maybe they change you, maybe you see weird stuff, but that doesn't mean it's true. You can read all kinds of mind-numbing nonsense about witnessing the birth of the Universe, or making you understand science (I wish I was kidding). Oh but it's true! Kary Mullis says LSD helped him discover PCR. Oh wait, he's an AIDS denialist and thinks Astrology has something to it. Nevermind. I can't even fathom how that would work. Maybe I'm wrong, but I somehow find it hard to believe these types of people, or anyone for that matter, would be in the position to solve partial differential equations while intoxicated. For [starters](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c58fy), this guy makes some idiotic comment, but OH WAIT WEED!!! HAHA! ZOMG LOL!!! I DO THAT TOO! AM I COOL YET GUYS!?!?! (Why do I find it hard to believe that the same people who whine about their social ineptitude also have huge amounts of pot? They're like *that* guy everyone knew who was full of shit but constantly bragged about how high they were getting.) But moving on to [acid](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c6aou), this comment and the thread are so stupid I don't know where to begin. For example, as someone who actually has OCD, I find it *incredibly* hard to believe it *cured* this person's OCD. Or even further down is the claim that acid made someone able to drink water. God, this is all such bullshit. But the [circlejerk](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c61ot) is by no means just limited to acid! No siree! Shrooms can cure all your woes as well. They're just illegal because the corporations (I love how all it's all some nebulous entity of ""corporations,"" never anything specific) just want to keep you down!

As a side note, I think [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c69by) could be a joke thread, but I see those same tidbits reposted every day.

It would seem the [MRAs](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c6py0) are out in full force [today](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c62kr). On the first, it is always amazing to me how quickly redditors will believe what someone says and not be curious to hear what the other side of the story is. It is possible that the guy is completely truthful, I dunno. Nevertheless, it speaks volumes that redditors are willing to upvote something they can't prove and more importantly probably have no experience with. It's yet another example of the ""wimmenz be bitchez"" thing on this site. The second is just ""friendzoned"" in so many other words. Peripherally [related](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c851w) is this pandering story. The story itself is not so much the problem as the manner in which it is told. I know the sort of thing the guy was going for, and reddit *eats* that shit up, that overly aggressive, ironically angry type of humour that most people stop finding funny past 12. Also the ""HAHA I CAN RELATED BECAUSE I'VE HAD SEX GAIZ"" too thing.

[This](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c7wxt_) and [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c5au1) are bad because they are two of the more egregious examples of pseudo-science I have seen on this site. The first, about holographic quantum mind is incoherent babble. But it panders so perfectly to your standard model neckbeard he can't but help and upvoted. The second is insultingly poor pseudo-mathematics, or as RationalWiki would say, ""golden ration woo."" It saddens me that the word fractal has been so debased.

Lastly, let us take a look at perhaps the worst example I have seen thus far:
[Every action and decision we make is influenced by the sum of our experiences, memories, influences and the environments we've been exposed to. All of which at a simplified basic level are actually events or elements caused by the decisions of other people. These decisions were in turn caused by another sum of experiences, memories, influences etc of those people. Doesn't that at some level make everything kind of predictable if we were able to map every single influence?On a related note, if every decision we make is influenced by things in our past, most of which were beyond our control, what does that say about free will?](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/186yhq/what_is_the_biggest_mindfuck_you_have_ever/c8c5v0e)

First of all, this idea is by no means new. It's more correctly known as Laplace's Demon. And it's wrong. This isn't an opinion, it's just matter of factly incorrect. Determinism is not real. This has been *unequivocally* proven to be true. And even if it weren't, a computer smaller than the Universe cannot compute a complete simulation of the entire Universe, making the argument null. Also there's this little bitty problem called complexity theory which means that some problems could never be solved within a finite amount of time anyway, just saying. Somehow though, our brave scholar, receives Reddit Gold for this. Why? Because it perfectly panders to just the sort of bullshit quasi-empiricist sort of mentality that Reddit has. It's phenomenon called ""scientism."" And it's just, as I said, wrong. What I love is the pathetically flaccid video someone lower down gives as an argument, along with a few others who cite Sam Harris. Sam Harris is a hack philosopher of the first degree, who has some pretty horrendous, disgusting things to say, such as that we should put people to death with bad ideas and that torture is liek totalee okay gaiz. With that being said, Daniel Dennet makes a very, very good argument on why Free Will *does* exist, but then I doubt he knows anything. It's not even the belief that free will doesn't exist that bothers me. It is, in no particular order, the spinning of an old idea as one's own as if it were original or insightful in anway, the use of empirically *wrong* arguments with no acknowledgement thereof, and the idiots who are so oblivious as to why the reasoning of the commenter was shit and go on to repeat the same shitty arguments to all of their shitty friends.

The end.

Man, that felt *good*.

Top Comment:

&gt;I coasted through elementary, middle and high school, putting almost zero effort in. This has come to bite me in the ass now in college, because I've never cultivated any study habits or work ethic. Plus, my short term memory, when studying for open-ended questions and having to explain a concept and memorize definitions, sucks ass.
So basically, it's hindered me in my ability to acquire skills that most of my classmates have. Now I'm playing catch-up to them.

So... basically you're not very bright?

Sitting at +330 we have:

&gt;I was never described as ""gifted"" but I never put any effort in because I was smart enough without trying. I'm now at uni and I'm lazy as fuck and don't really know how to study.

How do you not know how to study? Seriously?

Sitting at +81 we have:

&gt;I have actually asked friends how to study becasue I don't understand it. I actually spent my study time for mid terms looking up how to study for midterms.

1345301901.0,268,self.circlebroke,yfgxx,An e-hipster and his legal tender.,RhinestoneTaco,325,57,194,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yfgxx/an_ehipster_and_his_legal_tender/,"If there is one thing I've learned about the e-hipster (Members of Reddit and Fark and places of the like who HATE HIPSTERS SO MUCH but also just happen to only like obscure food/music/movies/products), it's that they have their own proud form of currency = obscure U.S. denominations like the gold Sacagaweas or the ubiquitous $2 bill.  

Thus is the theme of my rant today, [based on this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/yeqz5/i_had_to_use_my_card_because_the_cashier_said_i/) 

I have a theory that e-hipsters enjoy using said currency with the hopes and dreams that one day they will be denied using it somewhere and they can clear their throat, let out an AHEM, and drop some Wiki-knowledge on some bored, ambivalent 16 year old. 

I speculate this because once upon a time (A growing ""once upon a time,"" now, pre-Reddit but certainly not pre e-hipster) I worked at a McDonald's in high school. 

Every once in a while I'd get a customer come up to the counter and order, and try to pay with a handfull of $2 bills. I'd ask the guy ""Hey, man, do you have any $1s or $5s?"" 

As soon as the words left my lips, I knew what was going to happen. A cloud of smug would appear around their sweaty heads, one eyebrow would cock up, their head would turn a bit to the side, they'd let out an audible scoff and say ""AHEM I expected this, did you know that this is LEGAL U.S. TENDER and therefore you have to take it go look it up I'll wait I'm not leaving until I can pay with this scoff scoff scoff scoff."" 

Meanwhile, I'm well aware of what it is. I just hate the stupid things. Same with gold coins. There is no slot in any cash register ever made for $2 bills or gold coins. So you either have to stick them in with another denomination and screw up your count later, or stick them under the drawer with the debit receipts to be forgotten and screw up your count later. 

Anyway, back to the thread. Let's see if my theory is right -- that people enjoy paying with the stupid things just to 1) Be quirky and different, and 2) Hope and pray someone doesn't accept them so you have a story to tell and superiority to cash in on. 

&gt;Same thing happened to me a couple of weeks ago. The cashier even said ""sir I'm going to have to ask you to leave now."" I confused asked why and then he promptly replies with this gem ""the money sir. Do I have to call the police?"" smh people these days 

And in response to that: 

&gt;Haha, I'd tell them to go ahead and call the police. They wouldn't even get that far, I'm sure they'd talk to the manager first, and the manager would rip them a new one. 

.

&gt; I say this in all seriousness- your response should have been yes. People being publicly humiliated for their stupidity teaches them to not be stupid pretty goddamned quick.

. 

&gt; It's shit like this that makes it so hard to explain in a foreign country that Americans are really very friendly, except when they suddenly turn hellspawn belligerent.

That one managed to sneak in an anti-American rant. Good for him. 

&gt;I hate how fucking stupid so many people are now. 

. 

&gt;How stupid are cashiers these days? 

Further testing the theory:  

&gt;I had this experience with trying to pay with a gold coin a year or two after they came out at Best Buy. I couldn't believe it. 

. 

&gt; what moron refuses to accept gold? i hope he was fired on the spot when you complained to the manager...

. 

&gt; I really hope you called him/her a stupid cunt. 

. 

&gt; Whenever I use a $2, they ways automatically look at it as a $1. It's rather bazaar, but funny because they're like ""This is only $3"" and I'm like ""guess again. OHHHH"" 

. 

&gt; This post just made me rage at ignorance. I'd have made the cashier call a bank just to make them look stupid. 

. 

&gt;I bought a phone case from verizon and used a few two dollar bills.. The cashier was like ""are you serious? What is this?"" I just pointed to the ""Legal for all debts public and private"" and he accepted them... Douche. 

. 

&gt;Refuse to pay with anything else, wait for the police to arrive. Fuck the cashier. 

. 

&gt; A barista thought I was putting Chuck E Cheese coins in the tip jar the other day when I used a Sacagawea. 

. 

&gt;I was about to make comments about the Susan B. Anthony dollar coins. I can't remember if it was the Sacagawea coin or the SBA dollar that made a cashier get a manager to ask if I could use that to pay. That took 20 minutes longer than I wanted to be in a Wal~Mart.

. 

&gt; She won't, she'll brag to her equally ignorant friends how she stopped a scam artist today who made-up a fake denomination. $2 bill, really? Whats next? A 2 cent coin... wait... that doesn't sound 100% retarded 

. 

&gt; It's not your fault shes retarded...
 

Slightly different but in the same style: 

&gt; A year ago I tried paying for some clothes using a 1988 hundred dollar bill at a Gap store and the cashier, who was maybe 18 or 19, thinking it was fake, refused to take the bill. Apparently she had never seen the old style American C-Note, nevertheless, it's still valid currency. I asked for the manager, who was in her early to mid 20's, but she didn't recognize the bill either. Who the f*ck trains these people? If you're handling cash, you should know all the denominations, new and old, and how to detect REAL counterfeit money.",Quality Post,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,starflair,,True,t3_yfgxx,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yfgxx/an_ehipster_and_his_legal_tender/,

&gt; I think this is very true. I do sometimes realize I am reiterating something for which I don't really have sufficient evidence, but at least I stop doing it when I realize it. As long as you're open to being proven wrong on any of your beliefs, I'd say you're on the right track. [+25]

---

&gt; The problem with this idea is that some of us find it difficult to know what of ourselves to be sceptical off, we are simply to close to the problem. I like it when someone points out some idea of mine that I have no evidence for, it is rare however that I discover my own irrationality with out outside assistance. I am still sceptical of new ideas, but that isn't something I have heard of before.
I have a friend who is not really a sceptic, but he is an atheist (they don't go together I found out). Who rarely challenges his beliefs and will usually fight for them with almost religious fervour. I think you are better to be open to sceptical criticism [+14]

---

&gt; this needs to be spread to more places. not enough skeptics know to do this and despite pointing out appeals to authority, they will always lend an ear to randy. [+3]

---

&gt; See, I do this all the time. I am a psych student, and I try to argue against the mainstream model, in order to understand it, and make sure we're not mistaking medicine for magic. Academia doesn't like it. [+6]

---

&gt; Yeah it's far more difficult to apply skepticism to your own ideas than to apply it to other people's ideas. It's an important skill to learn. [+46]

---

&gt; This fact is why I spend about three weeks lecturing on ""Why you can't trust your brain"" in my Science vs. Pseudoscience class[1] . It is really easy to critique others, much more difficult to do the same to yourself. [+14]

---

To be fair to /r/skeptic (as I've got nothing personal against or for them), does this happen in every subreddit? Of course. I think it's the inevitable result of any online community made up of people who share very similar views and goals with you: you feel like you can let your guard down since you're at your ""homebase"".

At the same time, not every subreddit has ""skeptic"" in its name and not every subreddit posts this in their sidebar:

&gt; Need something debunked by those in the know? Looking to exercise some critical thinking or research skills? Want to eviscerate pseudoscience, idiocy, and irrationality wherever it lurks? Skeptic's Subreddit, where all the cool kids go.


This just goes to show that Richard Dawkins was right when he said, **""If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed.**""

However, his quote was about the God Delusion. It's a little ironic that this memetic delusion can propagate among and affect even skeptics and atheists.

Unless there's a eugenics blow out that gets especially out of hand, there seems to be little reason to single it out here.

This is my first post here, criticize the shit out of it.

[What is something that you have always wanted to tell redditors but resist posting due to the amount of down-votes it would receive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17hzuj/what_is_something_that_you_have_always_wanted_to/) is like a late Christmas gift. Now the thread is more than 7000 comments long by now, so I haven't gotten to the nitty gritty rabblerousing in the replies.

And yes, most of those things highlighted play like CJ's and CB's greatest hits, but it was nice to see that self-awareness in a non-meta subreddit.

Top comment and second top comment don't appreciate your predictable and repetitive wit.

&gt;99% of the recurring one liners on Reddit are not funny anymore and comment sections would be better off without things like ""dat ass"" ""right in the feels"" ""Murica"" etc. It's just so predictable and adds nothing to the conversation. [+2176]

and

&gt;Please don't bog down the interesting AMAs with quotes and puns. I want to read their answers, not your desperate cries for their attention. [+1989]

Reddiquette is for the birds, but here we talk about actual etiquette and civility as we discuss different opinions:

&gt;Most Redditors are rude. I value different opinions and appreciate correction where needed, but the smart ass way these things are delivered is absurd. Politeness can go a long way and I wish that people would realize this. [+1604]

And sometimes pith is really the way to go

&gt;You guys can be really racist sometimes. [+733]

and perhaps sometimes not

&gt;You're all assholes. Every single one of you. I hate this fucking website. [+586]

And no circlebroke post is complete without some SRS-lite thrown in.

&gt;SRS exists for a reason. In a way, reddit in 2010-2011 was responsible for it. For all the hate it receives, the majority of reddit had a hand in their creation. [+205]

And here's a lesson that we should take somewhat to heart, and really, I still don't know why we take this seriously.

&gt;Just because someone agrees with someone else doesn't make it a ""circlejerk"". [+492]

There seems to be plenty of other stuff worth reading- a bit about fat shaming

&gt;I really hate fat shaming. I hate myself enough as it is, I don't want to read a whole thread where everyone is disgusted by me too :( [+288]

one of many comments bitching about /r/atheism

&gt;Outspoken atheists are just as annoying as bible-thumpers. [+338]

a few mentions of feminism

&gt;You don't understand feminism. As a concept Reddit never seems to understand this.

&gt;Not every feminist believes in the patriarchy. Just because one feminist believes something fucked up doesn't mean every one does. Just like in almost every other political ideal there are extremists and crazies, but don't tell me I have to believe in the patriarchy and have to hate men because I identify as a liberal feminist. [+743]

and some familiar comments about maturity and the friendzone.

&gt;* Spiders and insects in general are only scary to horrible little children.

&gt;* Having an active sex life doesn't mean you automatically get herpes.

&gt;* You're in the friendzone because you're a sap and a jerk.

&gt;edit:  removed sexist language. [+869]

If it's not a whine, why did I post this here? I don't know, I just wish more people could speak up in a regular thread and not get downvoted to the negatives without getting accused of being a white knight, SRS or just overall humorless just because the commentariat decided to pick out jokes from Don Rickles' wastebasket. I'm never sure if things were really all that different when I created a reddit account six years ago, or if I just got too jaded and cranky.  

In any case, I've been sick all day, so this perked me up and figured it would be nice to mix in a post that isn't all doom and gloom.

(Edit - I also fucked up the title)

One thing that keeps me on reddit is the fact that reddit hates reddit. Seriously, other sites and forums I've been on have *always* devolved into a total echo-chamber of ""we are so smart, sheeple dumb"". Recently though, it has felt like the hate here is dying. People just think reddit is stupendous and don't take a second thought on the matter. We are big and powerful and enact great social change etc etc. Well, [until I ran across this thread!](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1htjq8/what_was_reddits_lowest_moment/)

Wary at first, I expected something similar to the 'controversial opinions' thread, but right off the bat a few examples of mass harassment:

&gt;When reddit doxxed some intern working at a company that borrowed a Jurassic park Jeep.  
&gt;The owner of the Jeep made some submission full of lies that the Jeep was damaged and nobody was going to pay for it, everyone took his word and then doxxed some poor intern girl who was sent rape and death threats over the phone and mail.

&gt;Vigilantes mistakenly calling out a legitimate cancer fundraiser

I had honestly thought the cancer fundraiser had disappeared into the ether, it's great to see the odd example of reddit (as a whole) showing a memory span longer than 2 days. Speaking of, one of reddit's most juvenile moments bobs to the surface...

&gt;Someone took a photo of a woman who had a bit of facial hair. Reddit mocks and insults her. Turns out she found out and politely joined the ""discussion"", answering questions. She was amazing, Reddit was king asshole.

[The question](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15h36e/americans_why_is_everything_in_your_country_a_war/):

&gt; I'm a junior policy analyst in Canada, and every time I look south to study some American policies, a lot of them are framed as ""wars."" War on drugs, war on poverty, war on Christmas (lol), war on whatever.

&gt; Is it because framing something as a war makes it more understandable to the average American? Is it just one giant misnomer?


Note that the question takes as given the premise that this is an American phenomenon, and that the answer must have something to with *America*.  Sure enough, at the time of writing, the top comments include le gems such as:

&gt; **In America**, a ""war"" metaphor lets you spend the most money and exercise the least transparency. It also brands those who don't support that cause as ""weak"" or ""soft"".

And of course, someone else links to George Carlin (a Brave^Brave^Brave comedian) ranting about war and Amerikkka.

&gt; War is a rallying cry, that implies an ""us vs. them"" situation. It's far easier to make **Americans** ""hate them"" than ""love us"".

not to mention:

&gt; There are 2 things **Americans** love: War and Hyperbole.

Of course, the premise is entirely fucked.  The ""War on"" construct has been a mainstream part of public policy discourse for a while now, and it's not limited to the US by any means.  As the inscription at the top of my post demonstrates, the metaphor of war to describe a metaphorical battle is an ancient one.

Now, I don't mean to pick on Canada, but since OP is from Canada, let's look at some recent ""Wars"" in Canada:

* Toronto Mayor Rob Ford launched a [War on Graffiti](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2012/08/27/toronto-graffiti-war.html).

* Canada has also adopted the phrasing of the [War on Drugs](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2012/04/15/pol-milewski-harper-war-on-drugs.html).

* Canadians don't have the War on Christmas, but they do have to fight back in a [War on Wages](http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1304788--walkom-the-teachers-dispute-and-the-war-on-wages).

* This is, of course, not to mention the Canadian [War on Science](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-27/scientists-decry-canadian-undermining-of-climate-science.html).

* Never forget, of course, how the Canadians are up in arms about the conservative [War on the Environment](http://www.ipolitics.ca/2012/12/01/harper-newspeak-and-the-war-on-the-environment/).

From the rest of the world:

* Pakistan has declared [war on polio](http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-5-150344-Govt-urged-to-intensify-war-on-polio).

* In Kenya, we see a [War on AIDS](http://allafrica.com/stories/201211300609.html).

* In Argentina, we have [una guerra contra las palomas](http://actualidad.rt.com/sociedad/view/82106-argentinos-libran-autentica-guerra-palomas-invaden-capital)

But again: obviously Amerikkka's fault.  It's probably the fault of the bloodthirsty fundies and the US's Military-Industrial Complex.

**In closing:**

&gt;  A prince should have no other object, no any other thought, nor take anything as his art but that of war and its orders and discipline; for that is the only art which is of concern to one who commands.

[The thread in question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/10u4ju/black_dude_here_i_just_want_to_send_out_some/)

I was browsing the default subreddits, being too lazy to log into my account, when I saw the title. Being a black dude myself, the phrase ""Black dude here"" was enough to pique my interest. My first read of the title got me nothing but confusion, but after two or three reads, I got that the black dude's mom wouldn't let the black dude's sister's lesbian friend go to someone's wedding (not sure if the sister's, the mom's, or the lesbian friend's). The black dude then ""had it out"" with his mom. Yeah, still kind of confusing.

To be clear, this guy was supposedly standing up for his sister's lesbian friend, which is something that I support fully. What I don't support is the bragging, back-slapping, and circlejerking that is going on in this post. 

Diving into the content of the post! Little did I know when I clicked on it, but I struck the motherload of circlejerking in this post. 

&gt;Not sure how I feel right now.. But I'm sure later on the emotion might reveal itself as some form of bravery.

Actually, literal, non-ironic, honest-to-God bravery in the first sentence. Let it sink in. Revel in it, because it only gets better.

Tomatosaurus (A.K.A. the black dude) makes sure to let us know that he ""got a couple good ones in"" by telling his mother he'd pray for her. This, from a guy who calls himself a ""fellow heathen"". Nope, no hypocrites here. Then, he ""tore *the* hugest hole"" in her arguments. It's a good thing that /r/atheism warrior was there. 

There's an edit, plugging some weird form of the race jerk that goes on, but the real kicker, the thing that made me want to post here, was this: 

&gt;If there really was a God, it'd be Reddit

what. wat. Let's set aside for a moment the ridiculousness of saying that Reddit - source of /r/CreepShots, /r/jailbait, /r/PicsOfDeadKids, /r/beatingwomen, etc. - is *God*, and the ludicrousness of someone on /r/atheism proclaiming that Reddit is God. Those aside, this is the single most arrogant I've ever heard someone say about Reddit. You post something, get a couple hundred upvotes and everyone telling you how good and cool you are, and now Reddit is God. The arrogance is just overwhelming. He goes on to gloat about how ""truly evolved"" everyone posting there is, and some bull about ""infinite propensity for change"" and other mumbo-jumbo. Whatever.

The comments are so full of bravery that I can't even contain myself. Let's look at the [top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/10u4ju/black_dude_here_i_just_want_to_send_out_some/c6gnzuo) (513 points). Just a guy talking about how he grew up in a racist home, but managed to break free of it, evolving from a minister to, not just an atheist, but ""a damned knowledgeable one"". Again, the arrogance, the sheer arrogance, just kills me. If you want to not be racist, that's awesome, but don't pat yourself on the back about it. Ugh. OP replies with ""Me? Is that you?"" (131 points) Yeah, we get it. Both of you are the Jesus sons of the Reddit-God. The other replies to the top comment are equally congratulatory, like ""You sound amazing, just thought you should know"" (14 points) and ""Please become a movie"" (3 points).

My personal favorite response is [#3](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/10u4ju/black_dude_here_i_just_want_to_send_out_some/c6gs0ds)(149 points):

It's late and I gotta go to bed, so I'm gonna leave you with [this last gem](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/10u4ju/black_dude_here_i_just_want_to_send_out_some/c6gsr0s):

I'm asking this because I fear that CB could become too much like them. Don't get me wrong, the blatant racism bothers me as much as anyone, but what drives me crazy about SRS is their ""thought police"" mentality. A good example was a discussion in AskReddit about the censoring of the word ""nigger"" in Huckleberry Finn. To my knowledge, no one was justifying the use of the word, but rather arguing why removing the word wasn't needed. Of course, SRS got on the bandwagon, because apparently mere mention of the word in a neutral context is bad. 

Another thing I've noticed lately is hints of reverse bullying here. For example, there was a thread where people were mocking a person in /r/childfree for having juggling as a hobby. The guy may have been obnoxious, but criticizing an innocuous hobby is uncalled for. Another was the thread on the Forbes article posted in /r/technology. There was a lot of paranoia, but I think it's kind of unfair to essentially call everyone commenting losers because they didn't have/want facebook.

I guess my concern in a nutshell is that CB should be about the discussion of circlejerks, self-congratulatory discussions where the prevailing opinion is assumed to be trivially true, and dissenting opinions are summarily dismissed. However, take for example the rape thread in AskReddit. While yes, the rape apologists were horrible. I don't see how the idea of the thread itself was wrong. I am of course against people defending rapists, but I don't think the discussion of occurrences of rape is intrinsically bad. The thing that bothers me about SRS is that they seem to think discussion of a topic implies endorsement. If I were discussing the arguments employed by slaveholders before the Civil War, that does not mean I support slavery or agree with those arguments. Now I know that there are a LOT of people who do defend rather disgusting viewpoints. SRS doesn't seem to be able to distinguish between the two. Let's not become that.

One thing I DO love about CB is that people here are generally pretty good about not just silencing dissenting opinions. So, what are your thoughts on this matter?


EDIT: Just wondering, why did my comments lower down about bullying and the no relationships thing get downvoted? This isn't a ""downvotes, really?"" thing, I'm just curious. Feel free to PM me too.

There were a few threads about education posted a few weeks ago that I wanted to do a writeup about but simply never found the time. I think that this jerk is most clearly seen when Redditors stumble across the topic of education.

A couple of weeks ago [this](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ccdiv/neil_tells_it_like_it_is/) post was posted on [circlebroke 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/1cd53e/um_how_is_this_atheism_how_does_this_have_1400/). It was crossposted to [/r/libertarian](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1cc7zc/couldnt_have_said_it_better_myself_xpost/) and [r/teenagers](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1cc4db/couldnt_have_said_it_better_myself). 

All posts are a tweet of Neil deGrasse Tyson posting about how [the school system values grades more then students value learning](http://i.imgur.com/f7JypS0.jpg). This kicked off a general anti-education jerk in all the threads.

In /r/teenagers we've got [people trying to justify cheating](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1cc4db/couldnt_have_said_it_better_myself/c9f9tk6) (that TA is very hyperbolic, but it's the responses I'm pointing out,) [more of this](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1cc4db/couldnt_have_said_it_better_myself/c9f3mkx) (again, look at the responses,) and plenty more similar responses as we go down the page. Also [some bonus smug](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1cc4db/couldnt_have_said_it_better_myself/c9f65a4). It's best not to be too harsh here - lots of people have similar thoughts as teenagers (especially regarding school being 'useless,') it's the shameless advocacy of cheating that's getting me. Yes, tests aren't great, but you're not entitled to everything without any work. I suspect this is just another facet of the brogressive 'entitlement' mentality, the same mindset found in /r/politics. 

It's been said a million times here, but it bares repeating. Being intelligent, on it's own, is rather worthless. It's what you do with that intelligence that is what is useful. Sitting at home eating Dorritos and playing Starcraft (or writing circlebroke posts at 1am,) doesn't entitle you to an A, a good GPA, or a good job. You need to work hard for those things - something which people in the /r/teenagers thread don't understand (or don't want to understand.)

There's also a [strain of thought](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/1cd53e/um_how_is_this_atheism_how_does_this_have_1400/c9fibxo) that tests are a barrier that represses someone's true creative potential or 'genius.' [See here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1cc4db/couldnt_have_said_it_better_myself/c9f3mkx). Learning takes work - often hard work, and being [brilliant but lazy](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy) is no excuse for not doing actual work. Tests aren't a tick saying 'this guy is smart,' they're a way to show that someone's understood the material and can apply it - implying a level of intelligence, but you're not entitled to an A just because you're smart. 

In /r/libertarian, a similar attitude is found (ignoring the fact that it has nothing to do with libertarianism.) [Here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1cc7zc/couldnt_have_said_it_better_myself_xpost/c9f9pmj) we've got a typical response found in education threads - I don't need school, I can learn everything good off the internet. This attitude pops up *a lot* when education or school is mentioned on Reddit. It's fetishisation of [autodidacticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism), the idea that formal education beyond lower secondary education is worthless, because you can teach yourself everything from the Internet. This usually involves a person in later secondary education/early college bemoaning the uselessness of their English or Social Studies class when they can teach themselves everything they need to know from Wikipedia and a programming textbook. The best example I've seen was a guy who wanted to drop out of grade 10 (~15 years old,) to pursue *game development* full time.

This jerk has interested me for a while, and I've been surprised that it hasn't received Circlebroke treatment (at least not that I can remember.) I think it ties back to a few things - firstly, the general lack of respect Redditors have for authority, especially teachers and professors. Why would I bother to learn from a teacher when I'm smarter then them? Second, there's also an element of a [misunderstood genius](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/15s60l/anatomy_of_a_circlejerk_or_a_grand_unified_theory/) who is *too good* for the school system. 

Finally, Reddit likes to see itself as a haven for intellectuals, a place for smart people to have smart discussions (go to reddit in incognito mode - it's one of the promotional banners.) Why is there thus such a lack of respect paid to education? Again, I think it relates back to the 'brilliant but lazy' and 'misunderstood genius' entitlement that goes around Reddit. Redditors want the appearance of being intelligent without putting in the work. I've found that *actual* smart people tend to be rather modest about their intelligence, it's those who are insecure about it who are the loudest in proclaiming how much of a genius they are.",Quality Post,False,,t5_2tnz9,1367082218.0,starflair,,True,t3_1d7v6z,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1d7v6z/reddits_attitude_to_education_or_the/,

My panties are in a bunch. 

After years of being on the top of the social food chain, hetero men are finally being overthrown by a coalition of women and the gays. Hetero males are obviously being oppressed by the opinions expressed in this TIL post. 

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10vbsz/til_that_in_california_and_3_other_us_states/) is about how Ladies' Night is banned in California and three other states.

These redditors think that ladies night turns women into [bitches](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10vbsz/til_that_in_california_and_3_other_us_states/c6h0o5c) and[ gold diggers](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10vbsz/til_that_in_california_and_3_other_us_states/c6gzhu1). 

[Phantamos](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10vbsz/til_that_in_california_and_3_other_us_states/c6h13bo) provides anecdotal evidence of this ""gold digging"" behavior.

&gt;I know a chick in Sarasota Fl who drinks all week for free because of this shit. Her and all her friends refuse to pay for drinks anywhere and think men should have to pay.

First off, why is he being so specific about the location he knows her? Is he hoping that someone else knows this particular girl from Sarasota and will confirm his belief?

Using the powers of logic and reason, he uses his anecdotal evidence to counter anecdotal evidence.
&gt;
&gt;Just cause you aren't doing it, doesn't mean the mass majority of women aren't. I can't count the times I have ran into women who are insulted if I don't buy them a drink. As if I gotta pay some tax to talk to someone with a vagina.

Three things about this irks me, he refers to buying drinks for women as a tax and women as someone with a vagina. The language he uses sounds pretty bitter. If he is so bitter about women wanting to be bought drinks, why is he going to bars where he is meeting these women? Oh because he wants to get laid, but doesn't want to spend money on drinks. For him, his talking is supposed to lead to him getting his dick wet and when he is denied gets bitter.

Now this TIL post is about gender equality, so let's talk about issues facing the different genders.

Young men's insurance premiums, now I don't drive a car, but I know that insurance is more expensive for those of the penile persuasion. Mustachiod_T-Rex provides a good [explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10vbsz/til_that_in_california_and_3_other_us_states/c6h0exn). And also tacks on that women's heath care costs was decreased and men's increased. And he and many others are oh so proud for being hated by [SRS](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10vbsz/til_that_in_california_and_3_other_us_states/c6h0n2g)

Some Redditors try explaining that women's health are is more expensive because they get pregant and they're responded to in a pretty blunt way.

&gt;Getting into a wreck is totally controllable, and 100% your choice to make. Having a baby is something that just happens and there's absolutely no precaution to prevent it.
Makes sense to me.

Oh shit sarcasm, I wonder if he's subtly referring the fact that men can wear condoms.
&gt;Last time I checked, it's a woman's choice to carry out a pregnancy, abort, adopt, or abandon. She can pay for it.

Last time I checked, it took a man and a woman to cause a pregnancy. What I dislike about these two posts are that they assume total responsibility on women. If a man gets a woman pregnant, she must either abort it because it wasn't their fault she's pregnant.

To break up the monotony of gender issue, here is a slight jab at America

&gt;These are banned in Australia... the whole country...

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10vbsz/til_that_in_california_and_3_other_us_states/c6h074d) brave soul used to be a Feminist, until he had his eyes opened by MRA's which he now proudly stands with. He uses the example of Ladies Night not to bring up gender equality, but to attack Feminists. Because the Feminazis don't fight against Ladies' Night (because there are other more important issues)

&gt;I think it reveals that they are not as egalitarian as they think they are.

Feminists are trying to oppress men and Lance_lake is fighting the good fight against them.

&gt;Feminists (most of them that I met) aren't looking for equality. They want to have more benefits then men and that is not something I will fight for.

I hate it when people use gay rights as a tool to acheive their own goals. Like when /r/atheism use gay rights only to bash religion.

This Redditor personally doesn't dislike Ladies' Night, but he is standing up for the nonvocal gay community on this issue.

&gt;I think it's the gays who have a problem with this? Can someone who is gay voice their opinion. I know you're out there. not trying to bash, just see it in your perspective.

Gay bars, now a place for straight men to pick up women.

&gt;i know it sounds weird, but gay strip clubs too. there were two gay strip clubs (that i was aware of) in the town i went to college in. after about midnight every night, the strippers would leave and the place would turn into a normal club. well, the women would be so revved up by the strippers that it would be child's play to go in as a straight guy and clean up...at least that's what I've heard

A bunch of heteros get offended when someone tells them it's rude for straight guys to pick up women.

&gt;Why? I don't find it rude if a gay guy comes into a ""normal"" bar to pick up men. Why should it be any different the other way round?

.
&gt;Is it rude to the 'heteros' if a man picks up a man in their 'hetero' bar?

Obviously these guys don't know how embarrassing it is to mistake someone for being gay or having some dude get highly offended and try to kick your ass because you said his eyes were beautiful.

&gt;The fuck? So a gay bar should only be for gay people. Something tells me this wouldn't go over well if someone tried to open a ""hetero bar"".

All nonspecific bars are pretty much hetero bars imo, but in fact straight men going into gay bars and picking up women are pretty much doing them a favor.

&gt;So really, us straight guys are just doing you a favor.
You're welcome.

&gt;Sorry, bro. All's fair in love and war.

 I got so angry reading the TIL comments and typing this out I don't know what to do with myself. This thread is full of it, entitled, misogynist and unemphatic men. Entitled because they feel like they shouldn't be paying more at an establishment that they can easily avoid. Misogynist because they women are constantly being encouraged to be gold diggers and bitches. Unemphatic in that they don't understand why gay bars exist and it's not because it's easier for guys to pick up women at.

So long /r/philosophy, I hard knew you. It appears this sub has just gone full retard with the drugs jerk. Apparently, philosophy isn't formal logic or critical thinking or anything, it's getting high!

Some le gems from the thread:

&gt;Perhaps simply the fact that the sort of people attracted to philosophy are more likely to disregard societal prohibitions unless a good argument for them is presented.

While this statement isn't *wrong* it bothers me in that it is obvious the commenter is posturing him or herself as an exemplar of this. DAE drugs = misunderstood genius

&gt;Or are looking to expand their field of perception in a variety of different ways - reading, drugs, music, whatever...

Doing drugs is literally the same as reading guys

&gt;Plus, drugs really alter the way you experience everything, this can lead to useful insights, epiphanies, etc. Drugs can be powerful tools for the user who looks beyond the recreational purpose of a substance.Denying yourself this opportunity based on mainstream arguments is silly, there is a whole other world out there.

Wow, this is the bottom of the bin. Not only are the only reasons not to do drugs the ""mainstream"" ones (DAE INJECT 4 WHOLE MARIJUANAS!?!?!? LELELELELE), but choosing not to do them is ""silly"" and not doing drugs means you aren't experiencing the ""whole other world.""

BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!

&gt;Not just one other world in fact but an infinite number of universes - each perceptual reality a chosen illusion. So I would say philosophy students know that they are perceiving an illusion and elect to chose the illusion they perceive instead of letting society download one de facto. In fact I would argue that is true of any thinker - student in a formal sense or otherwise. Again while honoring temperance I think prohibition only pollutes minds. Wait a minute I gotta go or I will miss my spot in the rotation snicker.

Oh my god, this pseudo-intellectualism here makes me want to vomit a little inside.

&gt;We tend to be more away of moral corruption in the legal system and more willing to challenge preconceived notions as well.

Drugs being illegal is definitely moral corruption from the man just trying to bring these brave sci[ENT]ists down. Because, puritans, or something.

&gt;Undergraduate philosophy students do drugs because they want to. Graduate philosophy students do drugs because they need to. 

2deep4me. Yeah, it's a well known fact that Gottfried Leibniz failed to invent calculus first because he didn't have enough weed.

&gt;Getting high with philosophers can be fun - especially the ones who are really smart and don't get high very often. Their epiphanies tend to be more interesting than ordinary folks and sometimes they will spontaneously grok something some philosopher said that they never understood when they were in class. 
 
ugh.

&gt;When I was going for my bachelors degree in philosophy, I took an existentialism class that was an upper level course. By the course number it was supposedly only for near-graduating seniors. However, somehow we ended up with a pretty wide mix of students, with more than a few having just taken their intro to philosophy and a few that hadn't had that. I came in early one day, having just rolled out of bed at the crack of noon thirty, rather hung over from a party the previous night. I left the lights off and made my way to the back of the class where my desk was, pulling my hood up over my head and letting the cool surface of the wood caress my cheek. Not five minutes goes by and a small chorus of cackling freshman come in, blathering on about whatever shiny things have recently caught their fancy. They immediately turn the lights on, thus adding to my misery. After about ten minutes of their inane banter, they turn their discussion to that of drug use in the great philosophers and begin pontificating on the why's of the matter. I listened for a few minutes and then finally grew disgruntled enough to say something, in some almost sure to be fruitless attempt at quieting them. ""You really want to know why all the icons of philosophy are substance abusers?"", I said, without any hesitance at jumping into their conversation uninvited, ""It's simply because the more you study ethics and morality, the more people become absolutely intolerable."" I put my head down. They dropped their conversations for the next few minutes until class started. Regardless of whether or not I was correct, I count it as a victory. Just thought I'd share.

Oh god! The smug! It buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrns. Nice use of the thesaurus though.

&gt;I met my coke dealer in a Philosophy class in college who was a Philosophy major, so anecdotally I agree.

I'll take 'Shit That Never Happened' for $500 Alex.

&gt;I've actually found it harder to do drugs after I was introduced to philosophy. You see the world in a completely different way when you're introduced to some of these ideas and drugs (pot in my case) just magnify these ideas to extreme levels for me. Granted, I have a long history of issues with anxiety, so this is all partially on me. But going from everyday sobriety to smoking a joint is like going from the mind state of ""Fuck, I forgot toilet paper at the grocery store"" to ""I am a something living on a rock orbiting a star that takes in photons and air vibrations and I am living a finite life"". As I type that second part out now (being sober), it doesn't phase me. But high? Oh Christ. Kudos to you folks that can read Kant and drop acid. I'll stick with my alcohol, thanks.

WOAH! SPACE IS LIKE BIIIIIIG MAN!

&gt;Sometimes you have to smash your continuity of self temporarily to become a stronger continuity in general. To have a strong sense of self is never the same as thinking you are what you are, LSD for instance smashes that to pieces.

I would criticize this statement if it actually meant anything at all.

Now, let's go back a bit and take a look at the main reason I posted here. Currently, sitting at around -30 is one of the few voices of reason:

&gt;While it is true certain drugs can be very interesting experiences, their supposed ability of offering new insights and experiences is very highly over rated, their main effect is simply making you more introspective, for anyone that does any kind of self reflection or occasional naval gazing the drugs do nothing special aside from clouding and confusing your own thoughts making anything you think at the time seem ""wise"" and ""far out man"". I have nothing against drugs or their users (that would be rather hypocritical of me) but people who so highly rate psychedelic experiences clearly were never very self aware people to begin with.

Now, I think that is a pretty reasonable way of putting it. He's not even bashing drugs, he's just saying that they don't make you into a Socrates. But apparently that's just too much because. . .

&gt;With all due respect I think your analysis is terribly generalized, and neglects huge segments of the population who, based on experience, would absolutely disagree. Whether or not you have had these experiences I do not know, but to say, it seems ""wise"" or ""far out"" at the time leads me to the assumption you haven't experienced a full blown psychedelic experience. One that dissolves the ego, and destroys your perception of the self. NOT one that makes you more self aware. The idea is to go BEYOND the self. The level of introspection I'm talking about here isn't one obtained with low dose drugs where you can walk around happily glaring at colorful pictures or attending a rock concert. I'm talking about ones that lay you out on a bed for hours, destroy space and time, and engulf you in other worlds. VICE just did a piece on Iboga and addicts. If you can, watch it and consider how powerful some of these plants and chemicals can be. They are able to offer the experiences and insight into the self to overcome even the most helpless of addicts. I wouldn't say these guys are thinking, ""oh far out, I'm an heroin addict, I should totally stop that. I'm not saying psychedelics are a requirement by any means. But the idea that one would write off these drugs as mere confusion and heightened introspection would lead me to believe you haven't done heroic doses of any of these substances. I consider myself to be a fairly introspective, person, and yet, even on the most introspective days, I would say I'm about 1/10th as introspective as a person in the throws of a deep psychedelic experience. I have never analyzed myself, my family, life, and the universe in similar way while sober. I think there is a subset of the people, philosophers I studied with in college, who always felt the need to dismiss these things. After all, they are here studying these things everyday, paying good money too. It would be a huge affront on their own ego to know that in the course of an evening a person can gain more introspection than they do over the course of their entire degree. There was always a sense of elitism with their academic studies versus what I would consider the birth of introspection, religion, thought, and philosophy. It simply shows a lack of open mindedness which is quite the opposite of what philosophy is all about.

Oh my god, what a bunch of pseudo-intellectual, meaningless drivel. Cool, introspection. Yeah, that's not what philosophy is. It's not thinking about how ""awesome things are man."" Jesus.

&gt;Well put. While you are saying that psychedelics aren't a requirement, I'd argue that you will never know until you take that leap. I'd even go as far as to say that they should be a part of the education of every human being. Why? Because they give you a certain understanding of what it means to be a human being on this earth in a way that can only be experienced. It is impossible to relate the psychedelic experience through words alone but it is a very humbling experience to say the least. This dissolving of the ego should be experienced by everyone.

Wow, you heard it here first folks: psychedelics are LITERALLY necessary to be property educated. Wow.


&gt;""how useful are they for gaining knowledge of true reality?"" Such a thing exists?

Oh god, are we really doing this? DAE WHAT IF NOTHING IS REAL!?!?!

&gt;What makes so you convinved that the reality you perceive when sober is the true reality, and that the reality you perceive while having a psychadelic experiences is not true. By virtue of what is one state of mind privy to a more actual reality (or more 'real' set of experiences) than another? Is it because you are used to being sober? The way I've always looked at philosophical psychoactive use is by analogy to a vacation abroad. You aren't necessarily going to get any work done while you're there, but what you experience may challenge some things you took for granted. For a stupid example, suppose I thought it was natural for the drinking age to be 21, but after visiting France, I know, from experience, that a drinking age need not be 21. Its not that you can't breakdown your assumptions and your presuppositions through rigorous analysis; you can. But drugs, in providing such radically different experiences (where, if all is right, you feel good and belonging and adventurous), can open your eyes to unsupported assumptions in common use, or give you an interesting intuitive understanding of some concept through analogy, or spark an idea that you can follow up rigorously later. Furthermore, I find the mere fact that with some small chemical doses can immensely change the feel and organization of my consciousness incredibly interesting. Nagel asks, 'What is it like to be a bat?' You can ask, 'What is it like to be me, in an hour, on some acid?'

Is this guy fucking serious? Well we can at least be certain that there is no way *in hell* that he's an actual academic philosopher.

&gt;&gt;I hope that you take this in the most positive way, but assuming that your sister does, in fact, look like Emma Stone, I would quite like to bang her.

&gt;&gt;Now, I assure you, it would be very classy. I'd take her to a nice dinner. We'd have a delightful conversation. I wouldn't invite her back to my place--not on the first date, that's not classy, you see. We'd go out again. Maybe another meal. Maybe some mini-golf. Maybe we'd go rock climbing.

[Example 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/10kf1n/confession_bear_on_my_birthday_today/)

Hey, socially awkward Redditors, I'm socially awkward too.

And I'm sure the comments of each one are even worse but I don't have the time to look at them.

[Now this is what this meme should be.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/vcx7z/i_have_a_lot_of_weird_stuff_that_id_like_to_b/) Or actually should have stayed, since I think that was the first one. Yeah, it's weird, but it's actually a confession, not a shout into the echo chamber. 

Now, I do understand that a real-life confession doesn't have to be unique. You don't have to go to the priest with a confession that you tied three orangutans to concrete blocks and watched them drown; ""Forgive me father for I have sinned, I masturbated to a picture of two women kissing"" is just fine. But this meme isn't that. This meme is ""Forgive me father for I have sinned, I find more comfort in prayer than in any worldly pursuits or possessions."" 

Confession Bear is more than just a set-up for a circlejerk in the comments, it already is the 'jerk. At least, in a r/politics thread, you have to start the jerk; with Confession Bear, it's already started for you.

It was the day that Circlejerk realized that they couldn't compete with /r/atheism no matter how hard they tried.

Redditors bravely race themselves to the bottom to show how completely immune they are to such propaganda",WileECyrus,304,50,136,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/17xqkg/woah_a_truck_commercial_is_trying_to_sell_trucks/,"This almost feels low-effort because it's like shooting fish in a barrel, but the comments on [this post](http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/17uecf/this_commercial_shut_up_the_entire_room_tonight/) are just maddening.

OP posts a link to [this Superbowl commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sillEgUHGC4) for a certain truck brand.  The title of the video itself makes it pretty clear what's at stake here, but OP seems to have intended the submission to be positive.  Submission title:

&gt; ""This commercial shut up the entire room tonight.""  

Maybe a bit much, but alright - sometimes even an ad can do that, if it's crafted right.  You've probably all seen how hard Redditors jizz their shorts over those Thai insurance commercials when they come up, so they're obviously no strangers to responding to ads in this way.

But wait just a cotton-picking, lie-spewing, Monsanto-idolizing minute there!  This is no foreign commercial about an abstract service - this is an *American* commercial for *trucks*!  Even worse, the commercial is explicitly directed at (and admiring of) the American farmer class, which has been a considerably significant factor in the country's success and general character for the entirety of its existence.  But what good are farmers to STEMmy IT drones who know so much better?  Can't Amerikkka see it's being duped?  Don't they know propaganda when they see it?  Thank goodness /r/videos is there to show them the way.

**You can replace the word ""farmer"" with Mexican and this commercial would still work.** [+1148]

Top-rated comment as of now.  Of course only Mexicans do any work in America, particularly when it comes to farming.  Saying otherwise on Reddit is pointless.  White people are only interested in honest IT work, exploitative banking, or lying about everything else.

---

**What the hell do guts and glory, not to mention the plight of the farmer, have to do with a shitty truck? All this does is try to invoke some sense of a sacrificial way life and then attach that sentiment to a vehicle. It's idiotic.** [+358]

Our hero bravely describes *what advertising is meant to do* and then comes to the conclusion that it's idiotic.  Civics classes = paying off.  The most absurd part of this for me is that there may actually be pretty interesting and useful answers to his first question, but he clearly doesn't want them and he sure as hell won't be getting them.

---

In a very rare positive comment:

**It's nice to see advertisements that treat work as something noble and worthwhile instead of mocking it as something suckers do.** [+234]

But don't worry, everything gets back on track pretty quickly in the replies:

**Dude, it was made to sell cars. If they can do that by exploiting your emotions then they have been successful.** [+174]

Because of course an advertiser's success invalidates *every idea* employed along the way.  Note also the implication that any engagement with emotional response whatsoever is exploitation.  Thankfully, those of us who understand SCIENCE do not have this prob[le]m.

**And on the ninth day, Satan said, ""Fuck those guys,"" and made Monsanto.** [+226]

**It's really frustratingly ironic how people are impressed by this ""commercial"".** [+146]

[He says, when virtually all of the top-rated posts in the thread are viciously critical of it.]

**The speech is absolutely amazing! Paul Harvey does a beautiful job of capturing and romanticising the hard work farmers put into there product. All the hours all the hard labor, knowledge, and dedication.**

**Though this commercial is not impressive. All they had to due was lift this Paul Harvey speech, slap together a few stock shots, and throw some over expensive truck into the frame throughout.**

**The commercial is not impressive the speech is. Its ironic that we're praising the work of the advertisers who did little especially in the face of the farmers portrayed in the speech.**

[I don't have much to say about this one apart from noting its simultaneous hitting of all the major smugperiority points while still slavishly endorsing Paul Harvey.  I wouldn't even mind that, because Paul Harvey was wonderful, but he often endorsed everything that the hivemind hates, and was completely unapologetic in doing so.  *This American Life* was not a fireside chat with Neil Degrasse Tyson or an excerpt from Carl Sagan.]

[But wait:]

**Though meditating on this further its good that people, myself included, are exposed to this speech, but it's sad that it's within the context of someone trying to sell me a fucking truck. I probably would of shut up too during this commercial, but then be pissed about how the speech is being exploited to sell a fucking truck. Better than most other commercials, but really commercials are all the same. Good or bad they want your money. Shame most of us, myself included, didn't hear this speech first outside of a commercial. Thats the society we live in.** 

Well, thank god he meditated on it; I was worried he wasn't being serious.  And nothing says brave, clear-headed rationality like gratuitously blaming ""society"" at the end!

---

**I'll get downvoted like everyone else with a differing opinion. But I really didn't find this commercial all that powerful.** [+64]

This ""differing opinion"" is exactly the same one being displayed in all of the other massively upvoted comments.  ***Have courage, men***

---

More Paul Harveying ensues, completely irrespective of how any Redditor saying the same things Harvey habitually said would be downvoted into the depths of hell:

**I really miss Paul Harvey's reports. :/** [+60]

...

**Paul Harvey the legend** [+34]

No comment.  Just... no comment.  Well, okay, some comment: Harvey seemed to believe in the truth of the Bible, the wickedness of sexual license, the stupidity of drug use, the primacy of the traditional family, the awfulness of liberty confused with gratification, and many of the other things you might assume of him based on those ones.  These subjects came up often in his radio talks, and he didn't mince words in addressing them.  Get this guy an AMA!  I bet his answer to the fucking horse/duck question will be all sorts of pleasing to everyone.

---

**Among the worst and least thought-out commercials I've ever seen. They try and appeal to everyone's emotions by talking about living the idealistic American life (but the only ones who live like that nowadays are the Mexican immigrants that are supposedly ""anti-American""), then popping up the logo of a car brand that has nothing to do with anything.** [+23]

Courageous insightfulness right here!  The Mexican jerk, the cars/trucks don't mean anything jerk, the appeals-to-emotions-are-stupid jerk - it's all here.  And seriously, seeing ""among the worst and least thought-out commercials I've ever seen"" coming from someone on a site that made Chuck Testa a meme is fucking rich.

---

Getting sort of worn out, so I'll just note one thing and close with an odd outlier.

The thing: once you get about halfway down the comment thread, into the &lt;/&gt;20 territory, you start to get a heavy mix of pro/anti comments.  Many of the pro comments are quite angry at the rest for their smugness, and I can't say I blame them.  

The outlier:

Somewhat bizarrely, someone [posted a link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqQUgkO45nY) to a knife commercial doing virtually the same thing, and commenters [fall over each other](http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/17uecf/this_commercial_shut_up_the_entire_room_tonight/c88z2bm) to declare how amazing it is.  I have no idea what the difference is; maybe the first one was tied to Amerikkka while the second was just tied to the abstract but hopelessly complicated notion of ""manliness""?  

If the latter, I hope they all realize that their insistence upon their immunity to pandering falls apart when it's revealed that they're really only suspicious of certain messages and not of ""propaganda"" itself.

Today, and over the course of the next few days, so long as this thread remains active, we will be examining the State of /r/Circlebroke, what it means for the future of /r/Circlebroke, and what it has meant in the context of the past of /r/Circlebroke.   
  
* **NOTE:** We want YOU to tell us all of these things. This is the ultimate meta post, from which we gather all of your feedback, suggestions, woes, trials, and tribulations and smoosh them all into some kind of squishy ball of popular opinion.  
  
#  
#  
**This is [~~Thunderdome~~](http://i.imgur.com/NZBTV7P.jpg) the State of the Subreddit Address.**  
  
####Why are we doing this?  
  
That's a GREAT question, and I'm elated you would ask it. Over the course of the last 1.333333 years or so, this subreddit has undergone a plethora of changes.   
  
Some have slowly crept in, perhaps drunkenly suggested by a mod on some Friday night and implemented some 4-6 weeks later. Some have been [vast, catastrophic changes](http://i.imgur.com/nPJ7bTz.jpg) intended to change the very character of the subreddit itself.   
  
The largest and most drastic changes, however, have come with the massive growth and turnover of the subscriber base. Whether it was BestOf [storming our beautiful, pristine beachhead](http://i.imgur.com/sHL51k4.jpg), an unfortunately well-placed plug in /r/AskReddit, or just the sheer, dumb, ~~bad~~ good fortune of stumbling upon /r/Circlebroke, we have, against all odds, reached over 20,000 subscribers.  
  
In light of all this, we thought it would be good to really dig down into subscriber opinion on a few things.  
  
####What's all this about then?  
  
This is an opportunity for you, the subscribers, to engage in a no-holds barred, anything goes, meta-discussion about Circlebroke. It's important this discussion is carried out *with you all in mind*, not just the moderators. We've often said that as moderators, we only have control over what you *can't* say. Everything else is up to [you, as subscribers.](http://i.imgur.com/eMoJRD9.jpg)
  
####What the hell are we supposed to talk about?  
  
Literally anything you want to talk about with regard to Circlebroke, Circlebroke2, or any of the others. Here are some starting points to get you all going:  
  
* What's wrong with this subreddit? What's RIGHT with it?  
  
* How can we stop rehashing the same old content? Do we *want* to stop rehashing the same old content?  
  
* WHY IS EVERYONE SO ANGRY ALL THE TIME? (this is one from the mods. we seriously want to know)  
  
* What do you like about the moderation here? What do you dislike about it? How can we do our jobs better?  
  
* What rules put you out. What rules you really like.  
  
* Does Haqua actually exist?  
  
* If the mods were stuck in a lifeboat for a month, who would be the first to be eaten? Who would be the last? Who would suggest they start eating people in the first place?  
  
####Some things we, as a team, would like to address before we get started.
  
* **Discuss the Discussion:** This one's been giving everyone a little bit of grief lately. What we mean when we say this is, *stop freaking arguing about the same things being argued about in the original thread*. If you want to do that, go do that in the original thread. Don't come back here and start bickering with each other over *how to cook a goddamned steak*.  ""CB isn't an extension of the original post and shouldn't be treated as such."" - GoA - K_Lobstah.
  
* **Fighting Words/General Hostility:** Some time back, we're not sure when, Circlebroke became really, really, really *angry*. Is this just how you all feel now? Is there anything we can do to help? CB is a subreddit for discussion, but that doesn't mean you have to be 100% serious or pissed off all the time. Which also brings us to the next point...  
  
* **Stop the Full-On Jerking:** Some jerking is fine, but you have NO IDEA how many comments like, ""Le gentlemen fundie sirs and their neckbearded fedoras can't handle le childrenz and think about the menz!"" we have to remove every day. This isn't /r/ShitRedditSays. It's not /r/Circlejerk. We definitely want everyone to engage their senses of humor, but this is NOT the way to do it. It's stupid and boring.  
  
####TL;DR  
  
It's time to buck up and talk about CB. Whatever you want. The mod team will answer questions or make comments throughout this thread, but what we're really after is WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY. This should be first and foremost a discussion amongst yourselves. 
  
Well then, what are you waiting for? Get to it.

1361334368.0,253,self.circlebroke,18v8bf,"Teenagers trespassing on your yard?  Not a problem, just don't take their skateboard.",OMGWTFROFLOL,301,48,204,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/18v8bf/teenagers_trespassing_on_your_yard_not_a_problem/,"There's currently a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/18tlxg/this_woman_hates_skateboarders_and_little_bastards/?sort=top) in /r/videos that has a video taken by some skateboarders of a lady who doesn't want them on her property.  

A summary of the video:  Woman asks the skateboarders to leave politely, and I'm assuming that she had been for a while since the skateboarders already are taking a video of her.  Anyway, they completely disregard her and when they keep skateboarding, she takes one of the skateboards and says she's going to call the police.  The skateboarders then corner her and as she turns around to try to get away one of them grabs the skateboard and they all run away, but not without one of them pushing her over first.

Some of the top comments:
&gt;TBH I don't think these kids are ""Punks"" at all in-fact they seemed quite polite about the whole situation, I would have lost my cool the second she took the board. I'm so glad one of them got it and made that old hag out to be the ass she really is.

Right, because the lady was being unreasonable in asking some skateboarders to get off private property and she deserved to be harassed and assaulted?  And I can't even imagine how anyone could call what those kids were doing ""polite"".  Laughing and running away as an older lady falls face first onto concrete is now accepted as polite.

&gt;Usually both sides are in the wrong with these sorts of video's, but the skateboarders asked calmly several times for their board back. They even offered to leave if the board was given back. The woman was just being a bitch, and the problem could have been solved but she just made it worse and even got herself hurt.

But let's go ahead and completely disregard how the woman originally was asking politely to stop skateboarding on private property, and how the teenagers completely blew her off and were already videotaping, which tells me they were trying to start a confrontation.

&gt;That's fine to make that observation, but you really shouldn't jump into a situation with a skater and automatically assume they fit your generalization. I don't think these kids were the ""completely inconsiderate, uncaring assholes"" you've dealt with. It looks like were just skating the flat gap. That doesn't cause any damage. I didn't even see anyone with wax or any waxed ledges. Sure they could have left when the (alleged) manager asked politely, but they also could have been a lot worse when she stole the board. They even offered to leave if she gave it back multiple times, yet she persisted.

""Hey guys, they could have acted a lot worse when they got the skateboard taken away after they refused to leave private property, so I don't think they were being assholes.""


The rest of the top comments pretty much say how the woman was entirely in the wrong for ""stealing"" and how much of a cunt and a bitch she was being during the video. 

 Could the entire situation have been handled better if she had just called the cops and didn't confront the skateboarders?  Probably.  There are a decent amount of comments that essentially say she should have done that and both groups were in the wrong.  But anything suggesting that the skateboards were the ones in the wrong while the woman was being relatively reasonable currently have negative karma.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_18v8bf,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/18v8bf/teenagers_trespassing_on_your_yard_not_a_problem/,
1352836546.0,252,self.circlebroke,134zvz,The swastika has NOTHING to do with Nazis. Now let's spend an entire thread discussing just how unrelated they are.,Twisty_Tie,324,72,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/134zvz/the_swastika_has_nothing_to_do_with_nazis_now/,"The original thread is located [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1345cb/happy_diwali_reddit/).

This is one of those rare instances when I give Reddit the benefit of the doubt. My own feelings about Reddit and Jews have been thoroughly recorded in my comment history, but I genuinely believe that it wasn't anti-semitism that led this picture of a swastika to the frontpage—it was smugness.

The picture is in celebration of Diwali, a major Hindu festival. To expound a little bit on Diwali, for those who hadn't heard of it, the OP left a brief history of the holiday:

&gt;Link to wikipedia page about Swastika

&gt;EDIT: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali

&gt;Diwali marks the return of Rama, who was the seventh incarnation of Vishnu, from a fourteen year exile. Diwali holds significance not only in Hinduism but also in Sikhism who celebrate the release of their sixth Guru (literal translation: teacher) Hargobind. The Jains celebrate it as the day when the last trithankara attained Nirvana or Moksha. Happy Diwali again! [+1281]

Great! It's always nice to celebrate other cultures and gives a little bit of context for the confused and curious. The OP left links to the history of Diwali and the swastika for anyone who wanted to probe deeper. Oh, and not a single mention of Nazis anywhere. It may seem obvious to many of us that the swastika has a history long before Nazi Germany, but for those who weren't aware before, they are now.

Overall, a big success. Right? Right? Well, as of 1184 comments into the original thread, I'm still searching for my first Diwali reference other than the OP's comment.

Now, I'm no fool. If a picture of a swastika hits the front page of Reddit, you can be sure that there will be mentions of Nazis all throughout the thread. Heck, to pretend the two weren't related would be even worse. But the manner in which Reddit decides to handle this delicate subject is nothing if not irresponsible.

The first comment in response to the OP starts the ball rolling:

&gt;I'm glad to see that there are others ""in the know"" all up in these here parts.

&gt;Peace, love and understanding. [+289]

...And the floodgates open. Suddenly, we're at a peace-off. Commenters who learned in grade school (or five minutes ago) that the swastika could also represent peace start coming out of the woodwork to defend the old symbol:

&gt;Ahhh... The swastika. A sign of peace and hope. Well until the nazis stole it. [+84]

Retorts another commenter:

&gt;It's still a sign of peace and hope. [+61]

Surely this last commenter was in a time-crunch. That would explain the lack of a clause expressing how someone might view a swastika in another light, say, after soldiers bearing the insignia murdered your entire family. Oh well. Onward:

&gt;Think of it as a great opportunity to educate. Every time someone new learns about it, that's one less person who will always and exclusively associate the symbol with Nazism. [+31]

Well, thanks for the education. I would have figured that one or ten or one hundred comments on the topic would have sufficed, but I guess you're referring to your real life. Let me assure you that I and those you've informed outside of Reddit appreciate your generous efforts.

&gt;Does anyone else think it's about time to start a movement to reclaim the swastika back from it's modern history? [+76]

and

&gt;Kinda sucks hard how the nazis ruined the swastika for the world, and something that started and truly is representative of something peaceful, is now seen as a disgusting symbol of genocide and madness. [+9]

and

&gt;It's high time that symbol reverted to its rightful ownership. [+376]

and

&gt;Of course the OP chose the potentially controversial pic, and good for them. Discussion will result, people will learn things. All good. [+21]

and

&gt;Not choosing to use the swastika in the specific photo could also be seen as confirming the Nazi appropriation of the symbol. It's a no win, or perhaps win-win situation, depending on your position. [+15]

and

&gt;did u kno dat the nazis usd this symbol 4 there flags? nazis r bad... lik dis if u crai... evertim [+193]

...are all merely samples of the hundreds of comments that attempt to explain or justify its usage here. But hey, why stop at the swastika? We should reclaim the swastika and

&gt;...the 'heil Hitler'-salute. Like, why should future generations be robbed of a neat way to say hello? [+33]

For the sake of this post, I've left out all the people who did ""Nazi that coming,"" ""Anne Frankly are tired of it,"" who knew it was ""Goering to happen,"" because Hitler wasn't so bad—after all, he killed Hitler! But I assure you, all of those comments are there. All in a thread that is purportedly about Diwali.

So there you have it. I'm complaining about a full thread of comments with which I don't disagree, all because I think Reddit can't handle the subject matter. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the Reddit we've come to understand as racist, sexist, Islamophobic, homophobic, anti-religious, anti-Semitic, and bigoted in so many other ways has finally grown a conscience just in time for Diwali. Just in time to rally around the common cause of reclaiming an historical symbol with deep Hindu ties. Or maybe it's just that Reddit is a group that likes to point out that they already knew that fact, or that it's a group that likes the way it feels when it talks positively about swastikas. Your guess is as good as mine.

In the name of thread completion, it's important that I point out that not every commenter has joined in the fun. Props to TOMATO_ON_URANUS:

&gt;Every single fucking comment on here consists of

&gt;""hurr durr it's not Nazis!""

&gt;We ALL know that. Every fucking 12 year old kid hears from their random-facts-laden friend that swastikas are ok because Hitler didn't invent them.

&gt;Shut the fuck up about it. We know. [+136]

and to m3nace:

&gt;Wow, biggest circlejerk I've ever wandered into: ITT: people going ""I'm so fucking superior and understanding for knowing about this since the 6th grade"". I mean look at this: ""I'm glad to see that there are others ""in the know"" all up in these here parts.""

&gt;Stop sucking your own dicks reddit (alternately, stop licking your own cunts. Equality - yoh) [+26]

and to Timmk85:

&gt;I love Reddit. Only here could you find a bunch of college kids arguing with nobody about the true meaning of a symbol.

&gt;Nobody is on the other side of this issue guys. [+143]

For the people that missed it, Reddit's prank this year was that they had taken over Team Fortress 2.  they gave everyone on the site either an orangered dot or a periwinkle dot with a scoreboard at the bottom of the page and an inventory that would fill up with text-altering items and hats.  You could put the hats on people's usernames and you could use the items to scramble text, take away people's vote arrows, make a sparkly trail follow their mouse, etc.

A number of subreddits also chose to do their own April Fools pranks.

/r/imgoingtohellforthis put up a fake ban page

/r/askhistorians implemented a bunch of new rules that they knew would piss people off like ""no more WW2 questions"" and ""we'll be allowing in certain types of jokes and memes due to popular demand""

/r/subredditdrama merged with SRSsucks (as if it hasn't already, amirite guize!?)

/r/asoiaf pulled a multi-day prank that brought [a bit of an uproar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1bgwja/and_in_the_category_of_april_fools_drama_i_offer/)

and there were plenty more.  

I've seen some back and forth on the pranks.  The /r/askhistorians one was the first one I saw and I'll admit they got me.  After that, the dozens of mod posts about policy changes in the sub got old and I stopped reading them because it was obvious what they were, but I won't fault the mods for wanting to do something different on April Fools day, and it *was* funny seeing a lot of people get fooled and angry about the sub changes (or happy in the case of imgoingtohellforthis being ""banned"".)  

What got me thinking about this post was the admin's prank though.  Personally, I loved it.  The site crashing all day was really annoying, as was the 1000% increase in karma whoring via ""team orangered/team periwinkle!"" posts appearing in numerous subs, and comments getting obliterated made the comment section in a lot of subs unreadable, but on the whole, I thought it was a funny prank, that apparently brought [in more traffic than Reddit has ever seen in one day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1bgkpv/how_will_we_look_at_april_1_2013_on_reddit_in_the/c96r05u)  I liked the randomness and the inventory items, and felt it was a nice change of pace from what we see on Reddit the other 364 days a year.

I've seen a lot of popular complaints about it though.

* That it's proof the admins don't care about Reddit anymore and only want to see traffic and jokes.

* That it started a war between Redditors instead of focusing on other sites like Digg and 9gag.

* That it completely destroyed good discussion and it's ridiculous that people would have to wait a day to talk about things.

* That it started a slippery slope that Reddit isn't going to recover from.

* That it was annoying because of the lack of instructions

This was an April Fools prank.  It's the one day out of the year that this kind of thing is *expected* to happen.  Hell, it wasn't even for the whole day, it was for 8 hours or so.  It isn't going to cause any waves of change, most people will forget about it in a few days unless it's brought up again.  It would have been nice if there was an option to turn it off, but pranks are *supposed* to be disruptive.  I think it just goes back to the amount of time people invest into this website.  They start to look at it like they're stockholders and that Reddit disappointed them with their unfunny and intrusive joke.  

Well it's April 2 now, everything is back to normal, and everyone can go back to their ""deep discussions"" about Sunday's episode of Game of Thrones or what new Pokemon are going to be in the next gen.

1360547796.0,253,self.circlebroke,18a5i8,I have to give it up to the admins: Reddit gold gifting for comments is pure genius,ArchangelleGabrielle,298,45,183,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/18a5i8/i_have_to_give_it_up_to_the_admins_reddit_gold/,"*I've been meaning to write this for a while, but I just never got around to it because I'm a lazy poop baby. Better nate than lever!*

**Welcome to the world of monetization through factionalism**. This is one of the few times I can honestly say I'm impressed with Reddit.

Think about it, metacoms like SRS, SRD, and CB/CJ (and the dust ups we all get into with each other everywhere ) bring lots of traffic and engagement to Reddit, but that alone doesn't make Reddit money. The same thing goes for the ideological flash points that arise from or are exacerbated by these metacoms (and the larger Reddit community as a whole): free speech, pedophiles/ephebophiles, feminism, men's rights, atheism, immigrants, rape, Ron Paul, etc. And then there's the general circlejerk stuff like puns, wordplays, memes, and all the other shibboleths you find in Reddit comments.

All these things produce a lot of traffic, comments, and overall engagement which helps bring in ad revenue, but lots of folks visit Reddit on mobile clients or they use adblocking software. And outside of vote counts, it's all really passive and opaque to the userbase; ad revenue doesn't feed back to the user base and encourage more engagement.

This is where most sites kinda just sit back or introduce weak premium subscriptions. Reddit started this with Reddit Gold and I thought that would be it, but on November 8, 2012, they went and did something remarkable.

**They created a way to tap directly into a flashpoint or circlejerk and give people the option to go beyond merely upvoting something they really ~~agree with~~ think contributes to conversation.**

After a few years of really training people to engage with Reddit through voting on what they ~~agree/disagree with~~ think contributes to the conversation, it makes a beautiful sort of sense to give people the chance to **really** show that they support someone's contribution to Reddit. And unlike an individual upvote, which get lost in a sea of other upvotes and downvotes, this explicitlly announces to the rest of the community that this comment just got your ""super support"". Moreover, it also can't be neutralized by a downvote.

And of course, there's always *ironic* comment gilding, for that extra layer of meta.

This especially holds true for topics that have a lot of social friction/drama to them, like the flashpoints and circlejerks I mentioned above. The best part is that by publicly displaying when someone's comment goes gilded, it creates a feedback loop by encouraging the posting of circlejerk/flashpoint content.

Of course, it also encourages people to make high quality comments, but so do upvotes. Both these mechanisms do help reward people in making thoughtful and valuable comments, but it's clear from looking at either what often gets upvoted on Reddit or the comments that get gilded that binary feedback mechanisms can be subconsciously co-opted and used in many different ways.

That isn't to say that comments made in circlejerks or flashpoints can't be high quality or that what I'm talking about holds true for the majority of gilded comments; I'm just saying that these binary feedback mechanisms can also be co-opted to reward and encourage comments in circlejerks/flashpoints that aren't necessarily high quality.

Finally, if you're not aware of this nifty feature, you can actually see the stream of comments that get gilded in a particular subreddit by adding **/comments/gilded* to the path:

* http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/gilded
* http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/gilded
* http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/gilded
* http://www.reddit.com/r/wtf/comments/gilded
* http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/gilded
* http://www.reddit.com/r/shitredditsays/comments/gilded

I think as more and more sites catch on to what Reddit's doing and going beyond passive ad revenue, you'll see innovative monetization methods like comment gilding. I'm looking forward to see how the free web continues to be ""free"".

Now kick 'em while he's down!",jamie_byron_dean,350,99,299,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/13izi0/we_did_it_reddit_now_kick_em_while_hes_down/,"Given Reddit's anti-Romney jerking, it's clear that Reddit was going to gloat after Obama won the election. And frankly, we're all probably pretty tired of hearing about it. Especially about Romney. So I'll keep this brief.

I simply found [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/13hs4e/mitt_romney_at_my_local_gas_station_he_looks/) to be pretty appalling. Look, guys! That guy we beat, he's pumping his own gas! Can you believe it? He's wearing normal clothes and pumping gas, like a people!

While there is undoubtedly a certain peculiarity in the contrast from pre-election Romney to ""washed up"" Romney (what a fucking thing to say - is every man who pumps his own gas washed up now? Is not having your hair combed and your face covered in make-up being washed up?), it should surprise absolutely no one that people continue being people, regardless of what happens in their lives.

The thing that makes this painful for me, though, is not just the horrible smugness of people jerkin' over Romney's washed-up defeat, but that even now they can't cut him a break ([LOLOL POOR GUY I BET HE CRIES INTO C-NOTES WHAT A FUCKING 1%ER](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/13hs4e/mitt_romney_at_my_local_gas_station_he_looks/c744lsu)), and those who try to are called out for flip-flopping, being typical Redditors who support the ""underdog"" regardless of principles (nevermind that Romney was *always* the ""underdog"" in this race, and Reddit sure as shit didn't support him then). 

The very top comment is great, it points out how obnoxious the OP is for snapping an obnoxious picture. The response to that, however, is quick to point out that Romney has money, so obviously doesn't deserve any sympathy or to be treated like a decent human being. After that person is called out, a British person (presumably) comes out swinging about why anyone on Reddit should suddenly find anything not-atrocious about the man. ""HEY GUISE, I THOUGHT WE HATED LITERALLY MITTLER?""

While the jerk goes both ways here - there are plenty of voices calling the OP out for being obnoxious - I feel that the Romney-has-money-so-doesn't-deserve-respect thing to definitely be the overwhelming trend of this thread, and all others it spawns. I mean, pre-election, there's some cause for hyperbolic rhetoric, I guess, sure. But now? Just let it go. It's not funny to point out that rich people are rich. It's not clever, it's not politically advantageous, it's not righteous or superior.

&gt;""He made his own bed getting to where he is, now he has to lie in it."" 

What the fuck does that even mean? He has to continue living the same life every other American lives? And he deserves it, too! The evil demon that he is! Or, 

&gt;""I guess it's hard to be sympathetic in light of the fact that, even though he has no one left to pander to, he's still going around being a total dick factory. Granted, his recent comments weren't intended to be public, but it's hard to see someone in the role of victim when they're making comments like the ones he has post-election-night."" 

Where are these opinions coming from, and why? What comments? It's not about victimization here - its about basic human dignity. Of course, Romney once said something about the 47% percent or something, so of course he's sub-human for the rest of his life, and if you dare to treat him with even a shred of sympathy or respect, you are a flip-flopping neocon who doesn't deserve the liberal beauty of Reddit.

&gt;I am unable to see how he does not deserve it. A person who wrote off 47% of the country as 'leeches' and lied at every possible step deserves no sympathy. You reap what you sow.

&gt;However, seeing how everyone is upvoting you, it seems reddit has hard time remembering the terrible things anyone had done if it was a couple of weeks in the past. I wonder how many upvotes redditt gives to cutting some slack to Hitler because he had to fight on two fronts and was hated by pretty much the whole world.

Something something, Godwin's law... (however, he's kind of right, in that Reddit *has* been known to defend Hitler in the past.)

&gt;It is pretty amazing that in such a short period of time you can go from missing becoming the leader of one of the most powerful countries in the world by a couple % to pumping your own gas like everyone else.

If you had a shred of common sense, this would not be amazing.

I feel like if Obama was seen pumping his own gas, it would be some kind of beautiful circlejerk over how down-to-earth and lovable the man is. When Romney does it, it's a dog at the end of his line licking his wounds and growling, forced into the depravity of doing something for himself. But maybe I'm putting words in peoples' mouths now.

&gt;For those of you who doubt this is him, read the GQ article about the last night Romney had Secret Service protection. 

Lol I mean what? Why would you doubt that a human being does human things? But whatever. ""Sources"" are never a bad thing, I guess. 

-

Anytime someone points out that OP made a breach of decency by taking this picture and putting it on a forum to mock him, that person is counter-balanced by a barrage of pre-election Mittler memes (""I expect he is just surprised that a non job creator could afford a camera."" LOLOLOL). Why make a point when you can re-hash old partisan jokes?

&gt;I completely agree. I don't know if they just worked really hard to keep him looking polished while campaigning, but it definitely looks like he has aged a few years.

Says the OP. Come on. In the first place, the man is 65 years old. He barely looks even that. In the second, I bet you didn't look like hot shit yourself that night either, OP. Who the fuck are you call a man out on ""aging a few years"" just because he's not perfectly made-over for the cameras and lights? It's just pathetic to me that everyone is swarming over this picture, acting like Romney has fallen from some untouchable heights just because he appears in the wild.

And people *are* swarming. I searched ""Romney washed up"" or something, and look at this [bullshit] (http://imgur.com/Q01XB) I get. Stupid memes, insults, and bandwagoning galore. And that's just the beginning, I fear. I really hope this picture doesn't get any more traction than it already has. Hell, even by making this post I worry I'm feeding it.

I feel embarrassed for Reddit that they eat this shit up. Whether they're jerking about how Romney is ""really letting himself go"" or not, it's a non-issue in the first place and people should feel bad for buying into this.

Except this didn't happen in Palestine.  It happened in Tibet.  And /r/worldnews shrugged it off.

[The top comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/14nt7i/eighth_tibetan_under_18_sets_self_on_fire_to/) express either complete indifference or outright mockery of the act:

&gt;&gt;Does anyone else think that egging kids on to commit suicide to further your cause is a little....immoral? I highly doubt she did this without help and encouragement from her community or even family.

Because the _immoral_ thing that we should really care about here is not the problem that she gave her life to call _your_ attention to, but the people who might have encouraged her to protest in the first place.

Even richer is that this is, at present, the second highest voted comment:

&gt;&gt;If she wasn't Tibetan, Reddit wouldn't give a shit.
She's under 18, and like most suicide terrorists, has been brainwashed to self-immolate. Both are driven by religious fanaticism. Wonder how much her parents are getting paid for this? Deaths like this always entail monetary payment, one of the large motivations for getting women to carry out suicide bombings/self-immolation. 

_Suicide Terrorists_??  This is shamelessly naked [Chinese propaganda](http://www.voatibetanenglish.com/content/article--china-paints-self-immolators-as-distressed-criminals-terrorists--141746903/1267231.html) that would get shouted down in any other context.

**Discussion**

This is, in my humble opinion as a long-time jerkwatcher, the purest and most naked example of how what motivates your average redditor is not the high-minded compassion that he jerks himself to sleep with, but vulgar contrarianism and [second-option bias](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yngzi/reddits_strange_affinity_for_socialism_how/c5x6adc).   

There is remarkably little which distinguishes the plight of the Palestinians from the plight of the Tibetans and, in fact, in many ways the Tibetans have the more historically legitimate claim to independent statehood.  So where are your legions of keyboard warriors bravely demanding that all the aggressors depart from land that ""was never theirs to begin with?""  Where are the reddit Gueveras calling for the indigenous people to fight to the very last for land that has always been theirs?

The problem for the Tibetans is that your average redditor picks his positions not according to any principled stand or compassionate instinct, but according to whether it allows him to rebel against society and contradict others.  There is no angle for hating the United States in supporting Tibet, no means through which Prof. Neck Q. Beard, ph.D can interrupt family members with a bravely posed contradiction.  If a fifteen year old girl can like something, reddit will reflexively hate it, and a fifteen year old girl probably has a good impression of the Dalai Lama, maybe even a quote or two floating across her Facebook page.  _She cannot be agreed with_.

Predictably, any time Tibet or the Dalai Lama comes up you can expect legions of redditors to come crawling out of the woodwork to insist that the Dalai Lama wants only to enslave the population and return them to a premodern feudal hellscape.  It doesn't matter that, to believe this, you have to [willingly swallow Chinese propaganda](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/12/04/China-Dalai-Lama-wants-theocracy-back/UPI-80641228437578/) to [regurgitate on the linked submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/14nt7i/eighth_tibetan_under_18_sets_self_on_fire_to/c7evtso), what matters is that you get to contradict someone.  

I was suspicious of the poster in the above story who parroted the term ""suicide terrorist"" because there genuinely are a number of hard-core, committed Chinese nationalists on reddit and throughout the internet who will willingly spew Chinese propaganda whenever China comes up.  What I found, rather, was the following submissions:

It's the good old piracy jerk on /r/gaming, but with a slight twist. 

User GreyLlama was in the process of pirating an indie game when he saw a comment from the developer which said, among other things, that he was glad people were pirating his game. He said he just wants them to enjoy it and asked for a small donation if you did. He also included gift cards for the game for people who ""thought it was too expensive"". 

So /r/gaming has a change of heart and actually feels bad about pirating this guy's game because he was so nice about it. And they think that any developer that supports pirating his own game ""truly deserves recognition"".

Here are some choice comments:

&gt;Yeah, I always buy Indie games instead of pirating. Fells nice to know you are helping a talented person achieve their dreams.    
&gt;-[lucasreher](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ydbdk/these_kind_of_developers_truly_deserve_recognition/c5uj877)

Clearly only indie developers have dreams. Any other game is made by robots working for a soulless corporation and therefore is OK to pirate.

&gt;Pirating from indie developpers is totally wrong, they make almost no money off it. (btw i'm not against pirating just don't do it with indie devellopers)  
&gt;-[sertigo](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ydbdk/these_kind_of_developers_truly_deserve_recognition/c5ujacs)

I just like the fact that he had to include that he isn't against pirating in general to avoid being buried by the /r/gaming hivemind. 

&gt;Also, if you're upset about somebody pirating your game this is the best move. You could attempt to go in there and bash the uploader, or try a futile attempt to take it down from PirateBay. Why not sound like a bro and win people over with kindness?  
&gt;-[Apocus17](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ydbdk/these_kind_of_developers_truly_deserve_recognition/c5ujcq1)

Yeah, if people are stealing your product that you spent countless hours of time and effort on, the only logical response is to go on the internet and act ""like a bro"" to the people who are stealing your games so that they feel better about pirating it. 

&gt;This is how I would market my game/album/movie. I would upload the torrent in the highest quality possible, even get myself a seedbox so it ranks higher in the lists and then add a little thank you note expressing my gratitude for the interest in my product as well as a link to my website should they the pirates feel inclined to support me through sharing my work with others and/or donating or buying something else.
That really beats someone else pirating it in shitty quality, some anonymous dude getting the kudos for cracking or ripping and me acting petty and complaining about it only solidifying the pirate's belief that I don't deserve their money.
&gt;-[Thefriendlyfaceplant](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ydbdk/these_kind_of_developers_truly_deserve_recognition/c5ujk0z)

--

I must admit that there were a couple of high rated comments that called OP out and said that a developer shouldn't have to support piracy of his own game in order to get recognition, but in general it's still the same old /r/gaming doing whatever possible to justify piracy.

-Abortion

-Gay (anything to do with gay, gay sex, gay people, gay rights, gay porn, gay [as in happy], NPH, etc)

-Republicans

In all the submissions I saw in the new queue, the more charitable members felt the need to clarify things along the lines of ""blah blah blah I think Rick Warren is the worst human being in the world BUT it sucks that his son died"".  Less charitable members went straight for calling him a fraud and charlatan and talking about how he'd brainwashed his son (DAE ALL CHRISTIANS ARE BRAINWASHED).  A few asked if he was gay, because, obviously, only gay teenagers commit suicide.

&gt; I still don't get why religious people become distraught when things like this happen. They believe in an afterlife - if they really believe what they claim, and if they're right then, their son (assuming he ascribed to their dogmas) would be in a better place than he would have been in any possible scenario while alive. They should be happy or apathetic.

As someone who has never seen /r/Christianity before today, the contrast with /r/atheism is striking and powerful.  If a mature adult with no prior knowledge of the two religious beliefs were to encounter the subreddits, would they leave with a better impression of Christianity or of atheism?

Today's submission is a [heartbreaking photo](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/15ir0d/my_sister_was_a_victim_at_sandyhoook_elementary/) of an empty seat at a Christmas dinner table in remembrance of a victim of the Sandy Hook shootings.

You know the rules, you have only 10 seconds to form an opinion and post it, with the goal of getting the most karma in the least amount of time.  Your only clues are the photo itself, the username/history of the OP submitting the photo, and the top few comments visible in your remaining time...  NOW HURRY UP, if you don't click submit in time somebody might beat you to that karma!!

Now the newcomers to this game usually go straight for the lowest common denominator... the username.  There is free karma to gather merely by mentioning it, and you don't even have to say much other than ""thanks [insert juvenile wordplay here].""  Karma accumulation tends to increase exponentially the larger the juxtaposition between the immature username and maturity of the subject matter.  In this case, ""pussyrammer"" and ""first family Christmas since recent death of sister"" was off the charts:

For the slightly more advanced redditor, a mere name alone is no indication of anything.  They need to quickly scour the posting history of said user to form their 10 second opinion.  In this case, there were two prior comments... one from 2 months ago on a WTF post, and one 12 days ago indicating OPs family was shattered.  While this was ample evidence for some, it was simply not enough for most.

Now on to the analysis of the picture itself!  A lot of our internet gumshoes pointed out the fact the picture on the plate appears to be a touched up version of the image of the deceased woman circulating around the internet... with a different background.  Now this certainly seems plausible, however not for the deceptive reasons mentioned in the numerous posts calling this a troll.  Somebody probably touched up the original picture for the family with a nicer background since that will be the image they will always remember her by.  Or, it could be something else.  

What is missing here is that infamous reddit logic behind why it would have been photoshopped... why would any troll make the effort to take a picture, add a nicer background, put it on some nice posterboard and set up the elaborate place setting on a plate with a high heel keychain?  Why would anybody go to this effort?

And therein lies the anser for far too many redditors.  THEY DID IT FOR THE KARMA!  Either it was a troll that wanted karma, or the OP is really the surviving sister of the deceased, and she is a karma whore.  Any other post shared on reddit is simply that... somebody sharing something they thought others might appreciate, or learn from, or benefit from, but this woman who might or might not be sharing some grief surrounding a very public ordeal is simply doing this for the karma.

And they would have gotten away with it if it weren't for the meddling kids sitting at home during Christmas break solving crimes like this and saving others from this kind of content!

&gt;The Jew has always been a people with definite racial characteristics and never a religion. 
-Adolf Hitler (Mein Kampf)


.

&gt;Not until my fourteenth or fifteenth year did I begin to come across the word 'Jew,' with any frequency, partly in connection with political discussions.... 

&gt;For the Jew was still characterized for me by nothing but his religion, and therefore, on grounds of human tolerance, I maintained my rejection of religious attacks in this case as in others. 

&gt;Consequently, the tone, particularly that of the Viennese anti-Semitic press, seemed to me unworthy of the cultural tradition of a great nation.
-Adolf Hitler (Mein Kampf)


One more thing before I begin, I am a citizen of Sweden and Canada, and have a Korean father, so I know some of the context of the situation in Europe right now.  

So the situation is this.  A Mosque is 'occupied' by a group of French people as a protest towards multi-cultarilsim, resulting in /r/worldnews collectively jizzing their pants at the opportunity to defend ultra-nationalist from the barbarian hordes of the East (Orientalism anyone?) 

With those quotes in mind, I would like to point you to this particular thread (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1221y5/french_farright_group_attacks_and_occupies_mosque/) that, well, for a lack of a better term... Racist.  It is disgusting.  absolutely disgusting.  Complete failure to understand the situation on hand, complete failure to understand the implications of the words that they use, and complete disregard for so called ""liberalism"" of the Western World.  I would like to pull out a few quotes here:

&gt;Islam is not a race. Therefore, this is not a racist attack. This is about the culture of Islam vs. secularism in France. I don't know why religions such as Judaism and Islam are confused with being a race. They are religions with morals and ethics that deserve to be criticized along with all of the other religions.(including Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, etc.) Violence should only be a last resort from stopping the spread of theocracy. It appears that some French people want to stop Islam before it spreads its influence and promotes Sharia Law. It should *continue to be done peacefully.
(http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1221y5/french_farright_group_attacks_and_occupies_mosque/c6rhotp)

First lets take a look at the definition of racism:

&gt;Racism - a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races  determine cultural or individual achievement, usually involving the idea that one's own race  is superior and has the right to rule others.

and 
&gt;Race - any people united by common history, language, cultural traits, etc.: the Dutch race.

This quote, currently sitting at 583/246 seems to set the tone of the rest of the discourse that is presented here, in a rather negative tone.  Right off the bat, by defining islam as not a group of people with a common traditional and cultural background is, in my humble opinion a very implicit way of stating that it is ok to conduct an attack on a group of people just because they are not considered a 'race' by your definition.  

Yes there is a positive spin to it at the end, but the truth of the matter is that they beginning of his/her post really dehumanizes Muslims in general.  
&gt; know Reddit is a liberal hivemind, but you can't bury your head in the sand on this, Islamification of Europe is a real problem.
No go areas in your own country, the treatment of women, the want to influence laws to follow their way of life. It is nasty.

&gt;Edit: I spelled it berry instead of bury, wow

&gt;Also before the mandatory ""They aren't all the same!"" the problem is is that despite not all of them being as extremist as the people who make the news, they still follow a set of rules and ideals that in no way seek to benefit society. There is no reason for us to take the morale high ground and be kind to them when they are nasty to us.
The sad thing is that Islam proberly could get along with Europe and be a part of society as a whole but people are so scared of being labelled a racist by some liberal who has just finished his liberal arts degree, no one says a thing. This leads to an appeasement, an allowance for them to do the things they do. We don't want to have to keep reading on the news about how ""youths"" have raped another random lady, with the key part of the article being about how we should feel sorry for the ""youths"" because of a poor upbringing.

Yes, because religion is inherently an evil entity, that seeks to destroy the 1st world as we know it.  I really doubt these people have ever met any Muslims, but have simply created a façade of what they think Islam is from fairly negative sources, that write about the racial tensions between the westerners and the incoming immigrants.  I have many Muslim friends.  Muslims that live in Sweden.  Guess what? they are happy that they are in Sweden.  They respect the rule of law that they have to abide by, as well as the culture that they have to respect, and the kicker, they are all fairly serious in there commitment to their religion.  

&gt;At least they're only occupying the Mosque, not slitting throats, and burning it down. Muslims deserve no sympathy because they give none. When someone offends Muslims their ""radicals"" resort to violence 99% of the time. Muslims are more than welcome to join the rest of us in the 21st century but they can't be allowed to pull the developed world back into the middle ages.

&gt;Did you notice that when someone criticizes Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism etc. generally nothing happens? But when someone says something against Muhammed or Islam people end up dead and embassies get stormed. I wonder why that is? Which of these religions seems the least progressive, the least tolerant, and the most dogmatic? (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1221y5/french_farright_group_attacks_and_occupies_mosque/c6ri23z)

You do realize that there are *1.6 billion* Muslims in the world right now, about 1/7th of the population of the world.  Are you saying that the 1/7th of the population is radicalist and want to destroy your precious way of life?  Could it be possibly that the people who live in these countries are usually very improvised, and are looking to lash out at something?  

&gt;Wow. Can someone please explain to me how it is ""racist"" to point out how the majority of crime is committed by Islamic immigrants? What exactly makes it racist to notice a pattern of behavior more specific to Islamic immigrants than other groups?

&gt;Also, Islam is a religion, so how the fuck is it racism to begin with? So reddit it totally fine with jamming multiculturalism down everyone's asses for the sake of not being racist? Give me a break.
There are even comments saying that anger towards nothing being done to remove/deport problem immigrants is a conspiracy by the far right for racial purity. No, it's people getting fed up with the bullshit these backwards ass immigrants bring with them. Islam is a mental disease. At least the other major religions don't blow shit up, riot, and attack embassies when they get insulted. (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1221y5/french_farright_group_attacks_and_occupies_mosque/c6rj9o4)

Right off the bat, he is making a false statement.  http://www.thelocal.se/2683/20051214/
Here is an article point out the majority of crimes committed in Sweden, were in fact, done by Swedes born to Swedish parents.  Its like saying a Jews are thieving bastards, that are going out and screwing the good Christian white man. Also again with stating that it is not racist to say or do negative things towards Muslims. Poppycock, people are dehumanizing them when they do this.

I could go on, but I would like to state a couple of my opinions of the matter at hand.  Yes, Europe has an immigration problem, but it is twofold, the failure of the government to control the rate of immigration, as well as their failure to help assimilate these people into  western society, and the immigrants who refuse to do anything about it.  It is not simply black and white here, there are a lot of things at fault here, and to simply state that a single party is at fault is simple and is devoid of proper discourse.  Now, I am in no way against immigrants, but I do recognize that there is a problem that needs to be solved.  The discourse presented, however, is very reminiscent of those that would end up committing mass murder, genocide, and war crimes in general.  I am guessing that the majority of the commenter in these types of threads are Americans, they don't know the situation in Europe, they simply assume that they know from the information that they have read on /r/worldnews, which is, suffice to say, a very limited view on the subject, as is the nature of Reddit's blasted upvote and downvote system (two wolves and a sheep deciding what is for dinner kind of things).  They have no interest in expanding their world views, but enjoy sitting in there little bubble of hatred, anti-Semitism, and Islamophobia.  These people have not suffered through the stories from their grandparents on the horrors of war and ultra nationalism.  I have.  You speak to a German who was involved during WWII... it is truly heartbreaking.  or speaking to my Grandfather and his experiences of the struggle of the Korean War, I honestly doubt that many 3rd or 4th generation Americans would know anything about that, simply due to the fact that the last major war on American land was the Civil War, and those that experienced it have now passed on.

Whichever side you fall on when it comes to male circumcision, there is a pretty low-quality of discussion going on in this thread. I personally don't believe I would have a child of mine go through this prodecure, but, let's take a look at the thread.

[Masectomy reduces the risk of breast cancer. I don't see anyone saying we should start removing women's breasts. +21](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/yweho/the_american_academy_of_pediatrics_announced_its/c5zfw5t)

Perfect. A tiny sliver of skin is exactly the same as removing two breasts, why had I never thought of this before?! Great argument. The foreskin serves such an IMPORTANT function, just like the breasts do. Men without foreskin cannot father or feed their children, and they are shunned from society because they've lost one of the most important things society decides makes you a female. Oh, wait, nvm.

But here's a nice dissenter.

Except that person just read the article, not the fucking paper the article writes about. Good job, Reddit, you really go far when looking for that evidence! FOR SCIENCE, amirite?

And, here we go again with,

That's like saying, ""Well I see that you have pizza here but I'm just not sure if it's REALLY pizza, you know, because I see it, but it's NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME AND MY MOUNTAIN DEW.

More strawmen, like how [cutting off your fingers](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/yweho/the_american_academy_of_pediatrics_announced_its/c5zg1sg) is the same. Then there's some more good stuff like,

From hating people who say YOLO and by extension young people since 90's kids never say YOLO, to the nondrinkers and drug user who look down upon alcohol.


First off, the top voted comment is
&gt;Yeah let's all hate people because they like one stupid fad that none of us like. Then let's take a picture of them in a vulnerable moment when you can see their underwear and their vomit and post it on a website where tons of people can see it.
Don't care if I get downvoted, I think this is wrong.

So it looks like people are bashing OP for posting this picture right? Wrong.

Replies to the above comment
Blaming the victim (I'm not equating them to rape victims, just couldn't think of a better word) comments:
&gt;Lesson learned, don't do stupid shit because most everyone has a camera and a direct link to the interwebs on their phone. If you are in public its fair game my friend, fair game.

This sounds like straight up big brother shit to me. Don't do anything illegal because they're always watching you. People are young and make stupid mistakes. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should post it online.

This next [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/10dnfb/these_two_started_out_the_night_by_yelling_yolo/c6coj8u) by rarely_heard_opinion, I don't know how to put in here because I fail at formatting, but I'll pick some choice text.
&gt;Doesn't appear they like it. And ""none of us like"" it because it would be absurd to abuse your body this way. Is there some kind of philosophical high when you hit rock bottom and start digging ? Feels like some sick version of Notes from Underground.

I don't know what Notes of Underground is, but the hyperbole of this comment is stunning. First off, this was a bad night of drinking, not hitting rock bottom and drinking til you puke is a form of abuse? It's not like anyone gets drunk to puke right?
LOL no
&gt;Their own fault.

Then in a moment of bravery, Rarely_heard_opinion offers us upskirt pictures of themself.
&gt;Big deal. Wanna see mine? It's not even completely clean, that must put me in a vulnerable position too! Oh the horror! But i am willing to do it, so it doesn't count, right? While they were not willing to do it, right?

I'm not sure what kind of point he is making so I'm going to move on.

YOLO IS STUPID, well I'm not really opposed to people saying YOLO since I've never encountered it besides on Reddit (just like how I hear about Justin Bieber and Nickelback only on reddit. Cone incidence?)and used sarcastically among friends. I understand it's probably a younger thing since I am a ""90's kid"". If you were from the 90's. Remember flash? There were a lot of stupid shit that was said when I was a teen and younger, but I can't remember what they are because like YOLO, they were insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Too bad redditors don't feel this way.

&gt;One of my middle schoolers has #YOLO written on his agenda. Needless to say he's failing every class

As a teacher, I am qualified to say that if you say YOLO. You're stupid.

&gt;I hate ""YOLO""- it's just an excuse to be a total asshole and completely disregard common sense and the people around you. Only obnoxious tools say YOLO.

Hates people who say YOLO because they are assholes and disregard common sense such as not judging and hating people for saying a word...???

Now comes for the part that really pisses me off. The condescending non drinkers and druggies. First off, I like to drink and I like to do drugs, but I hate those in the drug crowd that look down on alcohol and those who drink. When it comes down to it, I'd pick alcohol over weed any day.

&gt;You should try drugs. With proper research and understanding they are just as safe as alcohol. I've never got up the morning after a rave and been like ""Man I wish i hadn't danced all night and a great time.""
Edit: I'm just offering my opinion because that's how I am with drinking. If I have more than two beers I can't stop and always end up being blacked out and treating everybody i care bout like dogshit. Not a very good personality trait.

I don't like this comment, because it's anecdotal and bashes alcohol while elevating other drugs which OP is probably referring to MDMA. I can combat his anecdotal evidence of waking up after a rave with my own and my friends! My personal favorite is when I got ecstasy pills (I don't like doing pure MDMA, because I'm irresponsible) with some meth in them! The hang over was horrible, I just wanted to fucking die. Intense high though, there's nothing quite like a meth high. Probably didn't help that was also when I got mono at the same time. So I guess my anecdotal evidence is invalid. Thinking about it, don't know anyone who regrets going to a rave afterwards, but I also don't know anyone who regrets going to a party and getting drunk every time they drink. I do know people who have gotten way too fucking high and regret getting that high, a friend of mine did way too much MDMA once and started seizing. Just like people who have gotten too drunk. Alcohol is a fucking drug too, it's all about moderation.

This brave fellow,
&gt;Marijuana

Now for those who have obviously never drank or gotten drunk.
&gt;Ok. What is it that people enjoy about getting shitfaced to the point where they are incoherent and vomiting all over themselves? I've never understood the attraction

If you've ever gotten shitfaced drunk and puked. You know that you didn't start the night looking to end up like a vomit covered idiot. People who say things like the above comment makes me think they have never drank or just trying to be a condescending prick.

In response to a comment telling someone to drink again, revolting_blob has this to say
&gt;fuck that, he's better off without it

Yeah, alcohol ruins live. Go smoke weed or do MDMA. It makes you all peace this and love that.

To wrap this all up, I know that drinking til you puke is stupid. I've done it many times, my friends have done it many times. I have plenty of pictures of friends in compromising positions with dicks on their faces. You know what we do though? As decent human beings, we make sure they are okay. We clean them up, put them on their sides with a trash bag near them. Then we stack shit on them and take pictures to show them the next day. None of us, would ever post their picture online without their permission because we aren't assholes who get off on shaming others. I'll admit that I have laughed at strangers who have gotten too messed up, but that is the furthest I've gotten.

There are clearly many people that support /r/atheism's new change, but many more that believe it to be the second coming of megazord-karmanaut Hitler^1

From the sidebar:

&gt;In an attempt to destroy all freedom of speech in the universe, tuber and jij have discussed and decided upon a new moderation policy. Please read it below.

The policy change to the subreddit brings hope, and like the prodigal son, many wayward posters are returning to /r/atheism in response to the announcement. Unfortunately, the sub has a long way to go before it becomes a high quality default with a well developed *atheism-pire* of related subreddits...

____

   &gt;There has been much stated on both sides of the Mod policy change, with some for and some against the changes. But, in the discussion we overlook one thing, the reputation of this community.

This is a funny opening to me, since it is precisely the reputation of the community that leads me to want to see it improve to the point of being a forum that I might not be embarrassed to admit reading. 

   &gt;r/atheism has an online reputation that it has built up over the years, and that reputation has drawn many of those questioning their faith to check the place out, where they saw an edgy, exciting, lively place where religion was mocked, debunked, and treated less as a sacred cow and more as a cow in the slaughterhouse. 

Well, I really can't argue with that statement, but its the emotional inflection of this paragraph that is troubling. It isn't a good thing that the largest community of atheists online in the world is a place known for juvenile, disrespectful, and shallow content that doesn't seek to engage with the rest of the world. To be perfectly brave about it, the self enforcing hermeneutics in ""gOD is a lie, and if you don't like it, then you can fuck off"" is exactly the kind of thing that I would expect from a fundamentalist, or from someone who is very insecure about their position. 

Lampooning is fine, but the distinguishing circumstance of judgment is the method of lampoon. I honestly don't understand how *bravery bear* and *photoshopped checkered hat man* are better than even a deeply opinionated editorial at explaining why religion is not tenable. If I should have to go to /r/trueatheism for serious discussion, then I should also have to go to /r/spacequotes for inconsequential NDT aphorisms.

   &gt;Now, questioning atheists will come here based on it's reputation, expecting a vibrant community and find what has been since the change a boring, bland, lifeless place full of news you could easily have gotten off any of the hundreds of news sites out there.

No, they won't. 

What will happen is that the community will at least be average quality and young teens struggling with faith will not get the impression that fostering a persecution complex is the correct response in the face of actual persecution. 

I understand that reddit is a place for people to blow off steam about their real life problems, but a default subreddit claiming to be all things atheism should not consist solely of low quality nonsense. In fact, it should be some nonsense, some high quality, and mostly average. As far as I can tell, that's what the policy is aiming for by disabling images. 

   &gt;Christians have been trying for a long time to get rid of this sub-reddit, and with this mod policy change they've gotten the next best thing. Now, atheism doesn't seem so exciting or interesting and will seem as boring as their religion. They couldn't get rid of the sub-reddit but they could, through their constant whining and complaining about the sub-reddit, get it's hipness neutered. This way, in their view,  people checking out the place won't be swayed as easily to the dark side.

hahahahaha

This is probably my favorite paragraph. It begins with the assertion that *Christians on reddit* are persecuting *one of the largest* default subreddits because the subscribers *are atheists*. Also, it is apparently important that atheism be hip, entertaining and exciting, rather than a life philosophy. The policy change was brought about by a Christian conspiracy. Also, hold onto the word ""neutered"" until the last paragraph. 

   &gt;The old r/atheism was a vibrant mix of serious and silly, and if you wanted more serious or more silly, there were sub-reddits for those. But now, it's just links to other news sites posts for the most part, and most first time visitors will never know about the other more vibrant atheism sub-reddits.

No, it wasn't. Thats the problem. It was way too much bullshit kitch and not even close to enough profundity, except in the new queue, where it was completely buried. Links to other news sites? On a news aggregator? Fuck.  

   &gt;Yes, the place was sometimes like a blood sport with no actual blood, as christian trolls and atheist trolls squared off, but now it's like going to high tea at grandma's.

k

   &gt;Will I unsubscribe? No. But, only because I want Atheism to remain a default sub-reddit with it's posts making the front page of Reddit in general. It may be a more boring atheism than it was, but I still want it to get exposure to people, and keep pissing off Christians with it's presence. I just won't be checking it as frequently as I used to.

It was in this paragraph that the persecution complex ascends to brave-saiyan II, invoking both martyrdom and narcissism to justify the life altering choice to remain subscribed. Those are my two least favorite aspects of /r/atheism and reddit generally. I am glad to think that they may be on their way out if the community improves. 

   &gt;But, I think changing the mod policy was a disservice to those who use the sub-reddit regularly, who weren't even given a chance to have a say in the change, and it is a disservice to the atheism community in general by reducing what was a vital, vibrant hub for atheism online to a limp and flaccid shadow of what it was.

Well, this final sentence invokes the idea that the community has been disenfranchised by the moderators suddenly beginning to do their jobs. This is hilarious, and I invite you to hold on to the fact that reddit is not a democracy, but a feudal system as you read the comments section. 

Remember ""neutered"" from above? If we consider that in combination with the last (obvious, transparent, not clever) sentence, we get the added bonus of a repressed male sexuality underscoring the misplaced sense of entitlement. Am I meant to believe that atheism is sexy and that making it less sexy is a bad thing? Am I meant to feel like *my* potency as a human being has been impugned? I don't know.

&gt;The memes were sometimes a bit much, but they made me giggle.

&gt;Of course I realize I'm in the minority, but I just wanted to add my opinion in case the mods are still in consideration of what makes the page and what doesn't.
&gt;&gt;You aren't in the minority when what you described filled the front page every single day.
&gt;&gt;&gt;I can't tell if you're serious or just being hyperbolic, but I have never once been to /r/atheism[1] where it was all memes or facebook posts. Yes, there were some. But neither the front page or reddit or /r/atheism[2] was ever all memes and facebook caps.

I hate to make a circlebroke mountain and all, but in case this should come up, the general theme of this mountain occupies the entire top thread. Okay, so both sides are there -- but it seemed at my time of authoring this post that the meme-freedom party was clearly getting the most support.
____
&gt;Adding onto this, I really liked the memes. Sure they can be childish at times, but they were a great release from most of the religious bullshit I have to deal with on a daily basis.

This is one of the few valid points made, also highly upvoted. But easily explainable with the moderator-fascist theory of *separate-subreddits*, as first published in early 1939.

&gt;It doesn't matter what the atheist crowd wants. 

&gt;All that matters is what the screaming minority of atheist aristocracy wants. 

&gt;This place just had a coup, it's much like what happened to the NRA. 
&gt;&gt;Minorities tend to get their way. Squeaky wheel... 
&gt;&gt;&gt;Squeaky indeed.  At least 15% of every single thread was the same group of people bitching that /r/atheism sucked, over and over and over again.  Not to mention the constant ""/r/atheism sucks"" posts in /r/AdviceAnimals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well guess what, mods?  They're not going to stop just because you capitulated to them.  That's just showing weakness in their eyes.

Considering the nice talk with /u/jij that we had in /r/CircleBS today, I actually know that the third comment is wrong.

As for the incident comment, if any of you would like to explain to me how this relates to the NRA, I'd be game to have that discussion. Also, LITERALLY A COUP, /u/skeen was executed behind the chemical sheds (dae v).

[The set-up](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1h788c/serious_question/) - (If you visit the post, please don't downvote it. We want to keep the organic discussion flowing)

&gt; I'm an employer. I see a resume for a seemingly qualified person for a position I need to fill. I call the candidate in for an interview. During the interview it becomes clear that the candidate is a born again Christian (cross around the neck, thanks god for his/her opportunity, blah blah blah. You know what I mean).

&gt; Here's the question: If I decide not to hire this person because I see them as less intelligent/not capable of critical thought (as a direct result of their Christianess) is this religious discrimination? I would argue no; I'm not hiring them because I need an intelligent person to do the job and this was part of the screening process. However, I can certainly see others not agreeing with that notion.

&gt; Edit: In this hypothetical situation, I obviously wouldn't disclose my reasoning for not hiring this person is religiously motivated.

&gt; Edit #2: Let's assume this is for a ""big-boy"" job. Not some entry level 19 year old at a grocery store or something.

Ladies and gentlemen, /r/atheismrebooted:

Top Comment:

&gt; well....I had a guy that I interviewed, and he did well.

&gt; Except when he started requesting all these days off cause of his religious doings and running around to preach.

&gt; I hired another guy.

Not really sure how his religion is relevant if the issue was him missing days but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.

&gt; Hate to say it but you are right on the line. You better be able to make a case purely on qualifications between the 2 candidates.

""This is only a problem if you're worried about getting sued. Don't worry about the discrimination part, just make sure you cover your own ass.""

&gt; I'd personally call appeals to religion during an interview ""unprofessional."" Sure, his religious preference is protected, but I'd be concerned about having a guy on the team who didn't understand when it is or is not appropriate to thank his magic sky buddy. His religion is up to him, but he doesn't need to bring it to work and put it on display any more than he needs to preface every sentence with, ""I'm a black man, but my perspective is..."" or, ""it may just be my feminine nature speaking, but...""

&gt; TL;DR: His religious preference is protected, but you're (presumably) not hiring a preacher.

Having a cross on your neck or mentioning your religion is the same as starting every sentence with ""as a black man"". Therefore, it's wildly unprofessional

&gt; If he was talking about his imaginary friend Jake instead of God, would feel bad for not hiring them?

Pure bravery

&gt; Don't do it. If he is this out and open during an interview, chances are he is going to be spewing his thoughts on a 3500 year old book and all the fanatical stories it has in it to other co-workers.

Christian = Religious fundamentalist

&gt; Who cares. Competition for jobs is fierce so there will always be someone better to choose.

If they're a Christian, obviously there's someone better out there.

&gt; It is discrimination, and the fact that you're right-that his religion IS, at least, a slight indicator of mental deficiency that could negatively impact his job performance-is utterly irrelevant to the law. However, as has been mentioned by others, if you believe their self-expression (religious or otherwise) will be a hindrance to productivity (and let's face it, that's the REAL reason you don't want to hire him anyway), that is not discrimination.

&gt; Basically, passing him over because being a christian means he's probably an idiot is illegal, regardless of whether or not it's true. But passing him over because you're irritated by him expressing his christianity is not, because, strictly speaking, you're deciding based on his personality, not his religion.

It's discrimination even though you're right to think that he's mentally deficient. But, obviously they'll want to do nothing but try to preach in the workplace so you definitely shouldn't hire them. Unlike atheists, religious people always want to talk about their beliefs.

&gt; I own a small business in the Bible Belt and I face this situation all the time. First off, is your state a right to work state? If so, then you can fire the individual if he/she is not working out. Now he/she may file for unemployment and your SUI may go up a few points, but sometimes it's worth it to get rid of some jackass who can't speak two sentences without praising god. In the end, it is your business, your decision, your call, and you don't owe anyone any explanation for your hiring practices, especially other employees or potential employees.

As a small business owner in the bible belt, fuck equal rights. Just fire them if their personal beliefs annoy you. That's your right as a business owner.

&gt; If this person is otherwise qualified for the job, then yes, it is religious discrimination.

&gt; We have to keep in mind that not everyone who believes in these things (however silly they seem to a nonbeliever) is stupid. Many are simply indoctrinated or brainwashed, or even just clinging to belief for emotional comfort.

Of course it's religious discrimination! They're clearly brainwashed, indoctrinated and using their religion as an emotional crutch but they're *probably* mentally stable.

&gt; as a person who has trained new employees for a few entry level jobs, I hated it when my bosses hired somebody who brings there religion into everything. if a person thanks god for their interview stop them right there and say that they should be thanking you for making the decision. second think of your other employees. As an employer you should know their ticks and boundaries, you should have their needs inline as well as the rest of the company.

&gt; In my experience the born again's are usually the least lasting employee's right under Mormons, which is maybe a month or two. They both may be really nice but they think way to highly of themselves which drive's them to quit or more likely be fired, because they can't be bothered to do anything. remember this is for entry level jobs, fry cook's, cleaners, etc... if they can't be bothered to do half of those kind of jobs what make you think their qualified for a ""big boy"" job

We have a winner folks

&gt; I was thinking about a similar situation-- making a country that's officially non-religious, but still has freedom of religion. The best solution I could think of was making it nudist. I'm willing to bet most fundamentalists are too prudish for that.. probably not practical in an employment environment, but I guess one never knows.

Wow

At this point it's worth noting that OP is now arguing with everyone that disagrees with his (clearly) already held belief and agreeing with anyone who supports him. This is either a wonderful meta-lesson in discrimination or wonderfully ironic. Here are some of his responses

Someone replies to OP by asking how they'd feel if they were discriminated against for being an atheist. OP responds:

&gt; I can almost guarantee you'd be denied jobs across the USA for being openly atheist. Doesn't make my stand any better, but it doesn't bother me much either.

LovingAtheist explains the stupidity of that statement. OP responds:

&gt; But not by hatred. Again I'm talking about a born again Christian here. Someone who by my account is delusional. Literally not right in the head.

In a discussion over whether discriminating against **all** religion is the same as a specific religion

&gt; I see. So, in your mind, ""Religion A hates Religion B"" is identical to ""Atheist thinks people with delusions are less capable"". Got it.

Someone lets the OP know that they it's wrong and they should hire the best person for the job:

&gt; I would argue that this person is delusional and easily manipulated. Therefore probably not the best person for the job.

Crazy__eddie let's OP know that it makes *him* the silly one to discriminate:

&gt; Well, I've had a lot of professional success in the engineering world. I'm not that dumb. I also stereotype. I think most religious folks are easily manipulated. Just like I think most people with neck tattoos make poor life decisions and if I see Asian folks running around Manhattan with cameras they're probably tourists.

ioinic asks OP why he doesn't just test their critical thinking skills:

&gt; But born again Christians? If you're an able minded adult not capable of figuring out that the bible is full of hatred and unbelievable rubbish I really have a hard time trusting your judgement. Either that or you didn't actually read the bible and you dedicate your life to a falsity.

see0red explains that it's discrimination and if you substitute a political party, you'd see that:

&gt; I'm talking about a born again Christian here. Not just your ordinary ""Oh, I believe in god"" type. These people actually believe that the bible is THE WORD OF THE LORD. All of it. All the genocidal crazy stuff included. That's like discriminating against someone because they're in the Nazi party politically.

Kechlion tries to explain that judging a label is what makes it discrimination:

&gt; **I'm not suggesting I'm any better than any other person**. The difference between being a homosexual or a born again christian is choice. A born again christian (not a child, a full grown adult) is capable of looking at FACTS and choosing to deny them. That mentality just doesn't fly in my world.
So, not just that they are religious, but the born again christian part. (emphasis mine)

Hell, nobody that I've shown it to yet knows how to respond, even the most seasoned countercircleinfinityjerkers. 

This blog post submitted to Blueglass, titled ""Could Reddit Be the World's Most Influential Websiteite?"" (Subtitle: 19 Reasons Why Reddit Might be the Worlds Most Influential Website) is absolutely astounding.  Not only has it collected all of reddit's \*ahem* proudest circlejerks (while forgetting /r/circlejerk), but proudly touts them as the very reasons that this site is so perfect.

It starts off on a high note, introducing the list (everyone loves lists on the internet) on a humble note.

&gt;So, without further ado, here are our top 19 reasons why Reddit is so unbelievably awesome.

I'll go over the high points of the list for hilarity now.

&gt;**1)Being on Reddit is like sitting in a group discussion of thousands of moderately intelligent people, interested in the topic at hand.**

Hahaha moderately intelligent people.  Right.  The ones who make poop jokes, have to recycle memes from 4chan, and beat a pun to death, only to follow it into the netherworld to beat it further. Where everyone is an expert, anecdotal evidence is enough to contradict reputable sources. And then has the gall to give this post as an example(includes the link, of course, which I'm not assed enough to do):

&gt; “What stupid question have you always been too embarrassed to ask, but would like answered?”

A thread asking for stupid questions, when you just commented on how intelligent everyone is?  .....moving on.

&gt;**3)Reddit allows for intense and evolving communities of special interests.** ....Many of the following are among the most active places online for their given topic:

Author then goes on to name the source of some of the hardest jerks in all of reddit, /r/atheism, /r/trees, /r/fitness, /r/TwoXChromosomes, /r/malefashionadvice, /r/dubstep, /r/lgbt, /r/occupywallstreet, and /r/mylittlepony.  Yeah. *Those* are the communities of special interests we should be highlighting. 

&gt;**4)Reddit is highly collaborative and easily spawns or expands collaborative efforts.**

But so help you god if you repost anything you mother fucker I'll get your ass. But he then goes on with this glorious example:

&gt;Another great example was when the Reddit community collaborated to influence an online poll being used by Greenpeace to name a whale that was part of its Great Whale Trail Expedition, an initiative to raise awareness about whales threatened by the Japanese Fisheries Agency. The whale’s name was to be chosen in an online poll with the name with the highest number of votes being chosen. The selection of names were a mix of meaningful unique words like Anahi and Kaimana, with an extra silly name put into the mix as an afterthought. The name: Mister Splashy Pants.

&gt;**5) Reddit Helps Determine The News Cycle.**

If by 'determines', you mean fuck it up as horribly as possible, Yes! Yes it does!

&gt;**6)Reddit is the ultimate investigator.**

Reddit is the ultimate ~~investigator~~ Witch hunt. FTFY. Where facts are only necessary if someone want's to prove something *to you*.

&gt;**7) Reddit is a meme maker and trend setter.**

I don't know about you guys, but I'm just about to fucking burst with pride over that one.  

&gt; **8)Reddit is a life saver (literally).**  One of the most impressive sub-Reddits is the community at r/suicidewatch. These selfless people are there to talk to those who feel they have nothing left to live for. The community is certainly responsible for saving lives, though it is uncertain how many.
With nearly 9,000 subscribers, this community is arguably one of the largest groups in the world dedicated to suicide prevention.

I'm starting to understand *why*....

&gt;**10) Reddit includes experts from nearly all fields, vocations, talents, and specialties. Many of whom share their inside knowledge freely.**

Oh yeah.  I'm sure everyone here really has the qualifications they claim to.  

And I have a bridge I'd like to sell you...

He then goes on to name a list of celebrites who've done little more than host an AMA as 'notable redditors' and 'experts in their field', including Luis CK, NDT (of course), Stephen Colbert, Zack Braff, and Ken Jennings, plus a few more.  The only person there I would call an expert is NDT, and maybe Ken Jennings. But they're hardly prolific redditors, at least not on their primary accounts. 

Here's my favorite one:

&gt;**11) Reddit allows for in-depth discussion over topics that otherwise would never ever be talked about in a group way.** In many ways Reddit can be like hanging out with a bunch of friends. While this often leads to long threads on the pointless and inane, sometimes it yields really interesting discussions over topics that many have contemplated, but never discussed in a public forum.

And then the mother fucker links to this comment, np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7da5i/police_raids_reveal_baby_farms/c06cqxb

*sigh*

And this post, np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ehydz/til_that_roughly_half_of_men_wipe_standing_up_and/

A thread about how to wipe your ass!!!!! Because that's *exactly* the kind of dire conversations missing from this world, and god dammit we're all fucking better for having had this talk now!

And then, as insult to injury! Proudly brags about all the pun threads and 'inside jokes' of reddit!

&gt;**14) Reddit is like always having the wittiest, funniest people in the room.** Collective intelligence determines the best comments and they rise to the top of all threads. 

I just....

Then cites /u/prufrock451's story about the marines sent back to fight ancient Romans

But that's not really funny or witty, even though was highly enjoyable...

&gt;**15. Reddit can celebrate individual victory or achievement in a BIG way.**

Yeah with upvotes, memes, puns, and new inside group jokes.

&gt;**16. Reddit can be a source of power and revolution for the people.** If one idea resonates with a community, or one activity, the community can rally behind it with EXTRAORDINARY power.

Oh my shitting god. Yes, yes, let's reinforce the idea that we're all [this](http://media.washtimes.com/media/community/viewpoint/entry/2013/02/11/anonymouse_s640x427.jpg?73b8e21685896c3f2859310aaa5adb253919b641).  Totally Freedom Fighters, not cyber terrorist and petty hackers, and *definitely* not just pissed of wieners with chips on their shoulders and a complete disregard for the law or the harm that befalls innocent people inappropriately targeted.  Remember, reddit *always* requires facts, and is quite thorough in checking them before taking any action.

Oh, don't forget, 
&gt;""The community was among the first to protest SOPA and Reddit was a key player in the SOPA blackout."" 

We did it, Billy. We did it. 

&gt;**17. Reddit encourages interaction in a completely unique way**  . Although “karma” is worthless in a monetary sense, it has a social value for Redditors. The more karma a user has, the higher regard or esteem they are generally shown within the community. Gaining high levels of karma has become important to many Redditors and is an incentive for participation.

No! No you son of a bitch, stop it! Stop reinforcing that, that's everything that is failing with reddit's system now, it's not a*good* thing!

&gt;Conclusion
While the future of Reddit remains unknown, its example has clearly shown the benefits of crowdsourced content curation. The Internet has a tremendous amount to offer in terms of sheer content, but the value of that offering is multiplied exponentially when that content is organized and rendered by a motivated and thoughtful crowd. In the future, we will likely see many permutations of the system pioneered by Reddit, likely with [great benefit](http://www.mediabistro.com/10000words/reddit-story-ideas_b8643) to us all.

I....You...you monster. You're trying to subvert the whole site, aren't you? Trying to bring it down from the inside?  I know we can be bad at times, but shit man, show some mercy.  Don't do this to us. You need someone whacked? We'll help, heck you can come to reddit for help with that and many of us will gladly oblige.  But please, please stop encouraging *that*.

I need my blood pressure medicine.

I started using Reddit about two years ago, and around the same time, I moved into a new house. A commune-style duplex with a somewhat-fixed, somewhat-revolving cast of crust punks and socialist/anarchist neo-hippies. Cheap rent, shared food obtained via dumpster diving by the environmentalist, anti-waste portion of residents. It was multiethnic and idealist. We had artists, transgender people, urban farmers. It was a liberal dream.

As is my nature, I started the relationship with my new group unbelievably impressed and insecure at my own credentials to live up to their standard. I'm a musician, a writer. I try to be open minded. But I'm a white, heterosexual male. I agreed with the ethics behind the dumpster diving, but the practice of it made my stomach turn, and I rarely indulged in food obtained that way. But I was bursting with enthusiasm for their spirit, and I was desperate to let them know that I was one with them. 

Over time, as is my nature, I became disillusioned. 

It's a process I go through, and I imagine most people that are drawn to a site like this go through the same process. You meet a new group, you think this will be that wonderful, different thing that kicks you out of the malaise of day to day life. You think of it as a challenge to wedge yourself into their lifestyle. Your success is a measure of your open mindedness, your ability to function in a group. A new merit-badge for your concept of self. But part of that success is disillusionment. To become part of the group, the group is necessarily demystified. You see the ideals for what they are: affectations, desperate attempts to forge a unique identity. These people are just as lost as you. It's bittersweet, but this is the empathetic process of becoming truly accepted.

But sometimes something very unfair happens. The community to which you are struggling to assimilate degrades, becomes something entirely unlike what it was before. At the same time I moved in with this great group, I found this great site Reddit. I was late on the train and had some catching up to do. It had started as a small group of computer scientists. Then the humanities section of the colleges caught on and it forged it's own political identity. Pro-Obama liberal democrat with some libertarian leanings. None of this was my ideal, but I new that this was something special, a large group of people with a certain flavor. A certain sense of humor that was typically Internet, but attempted (sometimes failingly) to be high-brow enough to keep the SHOCK AND GORE dehumanizing variety out. Reddit's foil was 4chan, and there was always a debate regarding the extent to which Reddit was lying to itself. Reddit could, indeed, be worse at times. But that's the Internet.

The disillusionment process went as expected. I started noticing the casual racism here and there. The way grammar nazis can fail to understand the evolving nature of language and the legitimacy of regional dialects. The dominating demographic was educated young white males, and it showed. Women were regarded with the casual disdain of the undersexed. I knew it wouldn't be perfect, but I would still find the parts I identified with it and try to contribute.

But I can officially say as of right now, all those parts are long gone. And as proof, I give you dead squirrels. I have counted no less than three times in the past two weeks that a Redditor has been awarded a front page post for playing with a dead squirrel. 

The first time I saw it was [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/y1pvn/it_moved_rocks_like_this_for_a_while/). Somebody found a dead squirrel, put a stick in its hand, took a picture, and people upvoted him.

The second time I saw it was in a thread so disgusting, it was (thank God) deleted. I'll leave the [circlebroke](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yijow/did_this_redditor_just_kill_a_squirrel_for/) response as proof of its existence. Somebody impaled a squirrel to a tree with a knife and took a picture. Whether the animal was alive or dead before this happened is up for debate. But either way, it's disgusting.

Remember the stick in the first squirrel's hand. [That stick has already degraded into a beer can](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/yq1ul/last_night_was_nuts/) in my latest find. At least the first guy was trying to appeal to the pro-science community with his (albeit absurd) claim that the squirrel had used it as a tool.

And what's possibly worse is that the hivemind has already developed an established circle-jerky reaction to these posts. People enjoy pointing out that the original poster simply fashioned a dead squirrel to his liking, as if they are fucking Sherlock Holmes for figuring out that squirrels don't really drink beer. 

i understand my predisposition to disillusionment, and this is going above and beyond. The Reddit I became enamored with two years ago was a naive, idealistic bright young adult. Not a thirteen year old inbred sociopath with a penchant for playing with dead animals.

The only conclusion I can come to is that as something catches on, you start to attract the very people you flocked to your new community to escape. And then your community is gone. Just like the  West Coast punk scene of the mid 80s was overrun by aggressive jocks, this once bright blip of post-college polite discussion and open mindedness has become a place for hick children to poke dead animals.

Think of this as an introductory post for me. I'm new to circle broke, and whenever I find one of these reddits, I'm always quickly accused of breaking some rule early on. I'm modeling this after the decline of r/WTF, so I'm sorry if I did any of that in this post. Anyway, this is why I'm here. Hope you enjoyed the read. And seriously, what's with the dead squirrels?

For most atheists, this is due to spirituality simply having no place in their lives. They are content to allow others to believe whatever they please. But reddit has bred a unique brand of atheist that we've all come to know: the ratheist. For these atheists, it's simply not enough to not believe in God. They have to have the constant feeling that the world resents them for not believing in God. That it bothers people. That they are [le]iterally fighting against the world to continue not believing. And thus, these atheists often grasp at straws to feel as if they are in a battle.

With that narrative, [we find this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/13l0nq/a_year_in_jail_for_not_believing_in_godhow/). In short, a Baptist minister/small-time politician in Kentucky wants all state documents (specifically those from the Department of Homeland Security) to contain a caveat stating that the state of Kentucky relies on God for protection. The penalty of violating this law is a year in prison (though I'm trying to think of how exactly one in the DOHS, let alone a regular civilian, could even go about violating this law). You can read the linked Alternet article, but it's essentially a microcosm of the comment section of the post. A much more level-headed look at the law can be found [here](http://clcablog.wordpress.com/2012/11/19/is-this-more-than-in-god-we-trust/). 

Now a disclaimer: this law is patently absurd in ever way, shape, and form. I would venture to guess that virtually everyone on this site would agree with that sentiment, from both a legal and moral standpoint. It will be tossed out and used as toilet tissue if it reaches the Supreme Court. And even, in some bizarro universe where this law could somehow be passed, there is not a judge in this country that would convict anyone under it. As I said earlier, I'm not even sure how you could go about violating it.

But ratheists *need* to feel like they are in a battle. They must feel like they face persecution equal to that of any religious group. And thus, they were on this law like a turkey on Thanksgiving (topical!).

&gt;A Year in Jail for Not Believing in God?How Kentucky is Persecuting Atheists. In Kentucky, a homeland security law requires the state’s citizens to acknowledge the security provided by the Almighty God--or risk 12 months in prison.

Right from the outset, we have more loaded language than you can shake a stick at. Not only was this the most blatant karma grab since the Karma World Fair of 1909, but it's also entirely untrue. The state's citizens are under no obligation to follow the law. In fact, it's not actually possible to violate the law unless you work for the DOHS. But will that stop our brave ratheists?

HA! I mean sure, this law has absolutely no bearing on you if you are not an employee of the Kentucky Department of Homeland Security. And sure, it probably won't have any bearing on anyone when it is inevitably ruled unconstitutional (as it should be). But yeah, life's tough being an atheist

I'd like a shred, even a little tiny morsel of evidence to suggest that this ever happened. The only way I could see it is if the guy found out the guy he was doing business with was religious and he let him know within five minutes of meeting him that he was a brave atheist and the guy concluded that he was an arrogant, obnoxious asshole. Y'know, scratch that, I could totally see that happening.

The guy below him points out that this guy will also almost certainly not be affected by this law in any way. But it doesn't matter. Thank you for carrying the brave flag of atheism sir. Stay brave in prison!

Now to be fair, the comments on this one weren't that bad. The top comment points out the law is unconstitutional and he's right. Many point out that the law won't affect citizens, they're right. [This guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/13l0nq/a_year_in_jail_for_not_believing_in_godhow/c74xolq) gives a particularly good rebuttal of the entire article.

I always liked to pretend that it was just a joke for the most part, but it just isn't. /r/atheism actually believes that they are smarter than everyone else. No matter how much they love denying it, they do think that they are all paragons of reason and virtue. When really they're just as prejudice and close minded as the fundies they claim to be better than.

1346878712.0,232,self.circlebroke,zeut7,r/SRSDiscussion: A jerk both so similar and so different from the hivemind,Squidmasher,348,116,489,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/zeut7/rsrsdiscussion_a_jerk_both_so_similar_and_so/,"Today, I’d like to explore some territory usually ignored by Circlebroke: the Fempire.

Obviously, most of Reddit is rife with casual racism and misogyny, which is a problem. Between the weekly offensive joke threads in r/AskReddit, the weird fixation on false accusations of rape, and the racist fury that appears on r/Videos every time something about black people committing a crime, it’s pretty hard to dispute that stuff like that occurs, and that it detracts a lot from legitimate discussions that could potentially exist if redditors weren’t constantly making the same racist and misogynistic comments.

Another thing to note is that Circlebroke has generally always been fairly sympathetic to the views of SRS. Again, this is reasonable in light of Reddit’s attitudes towards race and gender, and SRS does a lot to raise awareness of the bigotry that can appear on Reddit at times. We also share a fairly large portion of our user base with SRS, partially because of the racism/misogyny, and partially because both r/shitredditsays and r/circlebroke are meta subreddits which attract people of similar interests. But regardless, there’s been a lot of pro-SRS circlejerking going on in this sub and I’d like to throw in something on the other side for a change.

Furthermore, I realize that the main r/shitredditsays is intentionally set up as a circlejerk, as evidenced by their image macros and fixation on dildo jokes, which means criticizing it for being too jerky would be like criticizing r/circlejerk for doing the same. Thus, I’ll avoid discussion of r/shitredditsays in this post.

What I will complain about is r/SRSDiscussion. Although their views are far from those of mainstream Reddit, that doesn’t mean they are immune to criticism on Circlebroke. After all, r/NoFap has come up several times on Circlebroke, and the hivemind can hardly be called anti-masturbation. NoFap is fair game for complaining here, though, because it is quite the circlejerk (well, in a sense of the word; they don’t approve of literal jerking). In the same way, many of the other SRS subreddits, while very opposed to the hivemind as a whole, are strong circlejerks in their own right.

Well, now that I’ve gotten all of that explaining and justifying out of the way, let’s get into the meat of this post.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We’ll start our journey into r/SRSDiscussion, the largest Fempire subreddit outside of r/shitredditsays itself. If you’re unfamiliar with it, the sidebar there describes it as “a modded progressive-oriented forum for discussing issues of social justice.” While we’re in the sidebar, we should also note that “comments which are discordant with the ethos of social progressivism will be removed,” and that the first rule is that you must agree with all of their basic premises to post. Essentially, disagreement with SRS, even if is respectful and polite, is not allowed on SRSDiscussion, which is a recipe for a massive circlejerk. r/Christianity, which is roughly eight times the size of r/SRSDiscussion, allows atheists to post and even question the central premise of Christianity, yet the subreddit remains a generally civil environment. If a subreddit dedicated to religion, one of the most polarizing possible topics for conversation, can allow fundamental disagreements with their central principles and remain a quality community, I fail to see why SRSDiscussion can’t do the same. There’s a fine line between a safe space and an echo chamber, and SRSDiscussion (and every other Fempire subreddit) errs far on the side of echo chamber.

But enough about rules; let’s take a look at some actual posts in SRSDiscussion and the furious circlejerking involved. 

-------------------------------------------------

This [gem of a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/z2v8d/kind_of_a_sidebar_coping_with_reactionsthe_rnc/) asks how people are coping with the Republican National Convention. That’s right; the OP here feels the need to cope with the fact that there are people who disagree with her politically (gender determined by posting history, not by assumptions). The idea that anyone close to her is “SUPPORTIVE of a Republican candidate” is just too much for this poor SRSer to bear (why can’t we have mods in real life to ban people for disagreeing with me? The horror!), and thus she turns to SRSDiscussion for support, and r/politics level jerking ensues.

[DAE le Sweden?](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/z2v8d/kind_of_a_sidebar_coping_with_reactionsthe_rnc/c60yzec)

[Conservatives are just mean, evil people](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/z2v8d/kind_of_a_sidebar_coping_with_reactionsthe_rnc/c61351j). This post, I feel, hits it right on the head. That’s exactly why I’m a conservative; I just like hurting people. I woke up one day and decided I want some people’s lives to be shittier. It’s got nothing to do with belief in personal responsibility, the wisdom of past generations, or limited government. Nope, I’m just a cruel and hateful person.

[If you vote Republican, you’re a shitty person](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/z2v8d/kind_of_a_sidebar_coping_with_reactionsthe_rnc/c625q0q).

The whole thread is inundated with such bravery, and I’m sure you won’t have any trouble finding the rest of it on your own. So let’s move on. 

-------------------------------------------------

In this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/z1u9m/irony_conservatives_feel_victimized_on_reddit/}), SRSers criticize conservatives for wanting their own space for discussion on Reddit. Although at least [one commenter](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/z1u9m/irony_conservatives_feel_victimized_on_reddit/c60yh1q) seems to pick up on the irony of complaining about another group’s desire for their own discussion space in a subreddit in which dissent against social justice activism is banned, the general consensus in the thread is that conservatives on Reddit are hypocrites.

-------------------------------------------------

[This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/yzf7h/i_need_a_privilege_check_is_proper_grammar/) is just absolutely baffling. These people are seriously questioning whether it’s oppressive to follow the commonly accepted rules for the English language. I suppose this shouldn’t come as a surprise in a place where language is scrutinized to the point where the word “stupid” is considered bigoted and “rape” is censored, but holy shit. These people are so caught up in trying to be inoffensive that they’re afraid of hurting people with normal speech. i gess i shud talk lyk th1s so i dun hurt ne1.

-----------------------------------------------

[In this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/yxa3y/what_do_you_think_of_american_imperialism/), we can find a good old-fashioned Amerikkka jerk. OP thinks that American imperialism is the most destructive force in the world right now. It’s not the crushing poverty that kills millions of Africans annually, it’s not AIDS, it’s not civil wars and genocides in poor countries, it’s us bastard Amerikkkans daring to intervene against countries who are rumored to be developing WMDs or retaliating against countries that harbor terrorists.

While we’re at it, the [top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/yxa3y/what_do_you_think_of_american_imperialism/c5zv0bk) on that thread argues that military leadership should be an elected position, presumably because the ability to pander to voters is far more important than actual military competence.

[And can anyone else not stand all of that Amerikkkan cultural imperialism](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/yxa3y/what_do_you_think_of_american_imperialism/c5zvcqc)? Never mind that the only reason it spreads is that people like it and thus buy it, it’s a conspiracy to turn everyone else into Americans and destroy their native cultures!

---------------------------------------------

Well, that’s all I’ve got right now. What do you all think?

Given reddit's not-even-remotely veiled contempt for anyone of imperfect physical proportions and the question's tactless delivery, it seems safe to say we're beyond feigning interest in a meaningful answer. Delivering on all your worst fears for this thread, the top comment drops like an atom-bomb of loathing:

&gt;I'm 280lbs with a really small peanut and I can't penetrate my girlfriend who is 330lbs. When we are intimate it involves her talking nasty to me while I jack off my tiny idiot dick. I squeeze her tits while I jack off. Sometimes I cum on her but not usually because we are really lazy and she doesn't want to have to clean it up. We are both going to die soon. Bye.

[+2176]

The fact that this comment is +2k upvotes says the obvious--this is exactly what the unwashed masses of /r/askreddit wanted to read diving into this thread. The comment itself is so brutally obvious in its pandering, it feels painful to try and offer any analysis or insight. Suffice to say, I clicked on a thread where I expected to find the standard dose of reddit-fat-loathing ^TM, and was actually surprised at the industrial-strength salvo of contempt that opened the *discussion*. Much to my chagrin, the next stop on this karma train takes it at face value:

&gt;Unsure wether to laugh to cry.

Following this is a quick 1-2-3 of a few of reddit's more conspicuous jerks:

There are a few worthwhile posts in that thread, but they fade fast and we're on to condescending advice for fat people (you should totally exercise or go to a gym!):

&gt;You can start going to the gym at a daily basis by this time, and your sex will definitely be a lot more enjoyable. Don't let anyone get you down, and always follow what you think is right. Always remember there are people who can help you, and will not stop at anything to do so. Good luck, and remember, every second on this earth is yours, so make it it count.

[truncated here--+60]


Next top level comment seems more sincere. If the karma counts are to be trusted, we are less than half as interested in something like a real answer than we are in just a huge spray of self-hatred. Don't worry, though, to get those sweet 900+ karma, there is a big old helping of that self-loathing we all came here to bask in:

&gt;Throwaway because gross.

&gt;My bf and I are both obese, but under 300lbs (...yay...) if that puts it into perspective. The issues we face mostly relate to things getting in the way, like my butt. For instance, penetrating me while spooning pretty much can't happen because my butt is to big. Also problems with me being on top: for one, I can't hold the squat position for terribly long before my thighs start to burn. Also stomach tends to flop when bouncing up and down, which is embarrassing for me. Also when he's on top, I need him to hold himself up a bit so that the weight of him+ his stomach (where he carries his weight) makes it hard to breathe, especially if he tries to kiss me at the same time. If we were both fit, I could be on top for longer, I wouldn't feel like suffocating when he's flat-out laying on top of me, he could pick me up, and apparently he'd gain possibly an inch or more with weight loss.

[+937]

That thread spins out in a series of tangents of various jerkyness on topics of turtle penis, penis size, and terribly overwrought prose. 


The next top level comment is an apparently sincere answer a much proportionately lower dose of self-loathing, so I'm a bit confused as to why it has upvote, but I'll include it to contribute to completeness:

&gt;I get a bit tired when I'm on top... mostly my legs get tired if I'm in the ""squat"" position (e.g. reverse cowgirl).

&gt;If he's on top and tries to put my ankles up on his shoulders, his belly squishes my belly which then squishes my titties and they kind of push up onto my throat and make it difficult to breathe. I don't want to die being suffocated by my own titty fat during sex.

&gt;Doggy is a clear winner, and quite conveniently my favourite anyway.

[+933]

A few bad jokes and a brief actual discussion of the mechanics of overweight sex ensues, but in an obligatorily self-effacing tone:

&gt;I… I guess I could kneel on a pile of pillows or something. Build a scaffold. Balance on the nightstands. It's all getting quite complicated now. I'd much rather he just bent me over and took me from behind.

[+219]

Next top level comment is a bad joke about the flavor of lubricants (HA HA fat people, food joke, get it?):

&gt;Depends on what flavor condom/lube we are using

[+527]

If anyone is still with the thread at this point, I'm sure you could mine up some further gems to contribute--I'm past my breaking point this fine Sunday morning. Maybe after another cup of coffee, I'll see how deep this thing goes.

&gt;The moderators of /r/worldpolitics will never moderate posts and comments at their discretion, with regard to their perception of the suitability of said posts and comments for this subreddit. Thank you for your understanding.

Ah yes, the hallmark of a quality subreddit: nonexistent moderation. That's why subs like /r/politics and /r/worldnews are centers of learning intellectual discourse!

But before we move on, I would like to address some of your concerns. Some of you may be wondering ""How can this be one of the worst subreddits? /r/Anarchism is jerkier, /r/Communism is more insane, /r/beatingwomen is more offensive!"". These points are all true and valid, but I would like to point out one key detail. /r/Communism has 3k subs. /r/beatingwomen has 1.7k subs. /r/Anarchism has 28k subs. /r/worldpolitics? **60k subs.** That's a small city! My point is, what /r/worldpolitics lacks in jaw-dropping ridiculousness, it makes for with the fact that it has one of the best subscribers-to-shittyness ratios of all subs.

On to the threads! As you look through the frontpage, a pattern starts to emerge. Currently (at the time this post was written), **9** of the top 25 posts are about Israel. This is not a coincidence. This is the frontpage every day. Anything, no matter how un-sourced and sensationalized, that feeds the flames against Israel is unanimously upvoted to the top (We'll get into more detail about their ridiculous antisemitism in the comments section). But of course, the threads that aren't about Israel are just as ridiculous. Currently sitting at number 3:
&gt;Some North Korean Refugees Are So Depressed By Their Life In The South That They Go Back North

You hear that? Enlightened North Koreans are so depressed by the horrors of capitalism that they wish that they could return to the prosperity and glory of communist North Korea! North Korea is best Korea!

Because threads have to be linked to actual articles, there's a limit to how editorialized and sensationalized they can be. Luckily for us, the comments have no such restrictions! On to the meat of the shit-sandwich that is /r/worldpolitics: the comments.

Let's take a look at the top thread:

&gt;Zionist JEWS are accusing their opponents of anti-Semitism aka anti-Jewishness. This makes it about racist, JEWISH supremacism.

&gt;Until more of organized Jewry stands up and declares institutional JEWISH supremacism wrong, not only Israeli Jewish supremacism, but the kind of Jewish supremacism practiced and imposed here in the states as epitomized by the racist Jewish enforcers exposed in this article, and the kind of Jewish supremacism [1] practiced by the Democratic Party and [2] on the neocon right, organized Jewry is fair game for any and all criticism.
&gt;They can't get away any longer with hiding their racist, Jewish supremacist agenda, both Israeli Zionist and Diaspora Zionist, behind accusations of anti-Semitism.

&gt;&gt;Please, tell me more about how all Jews are guilty for the crimes of Israel.

&gt;""All Jews""? I wouldn't say that. But certainly most Jews are Zionists, as epitomized by the fact that all of the hugely disproportionate number of Jews elected to Congress are Zionists.

&gt;Certainly, individual Jews here and there, and small Jewish groups here and there are anti-Zionist, but by and large, the vast majority of organized Jewry is racist/Zionist (despite the whole Jewish victim shtick thing, and empty claims of ""social justice"" and ""humanitarianism,"" which is all self-serving, opportunistic cover.)

&gt;They seem to get it from their racist Jewish doctrine and dogma.

Nothing has ever sickened me more on Reddit than some of these comments that I read. The part that disgusted me so much was how genuine the comments were, the fact that another human being could actually feel this way about an entire race of people. I can't even think of ways to make this sarcastic, reading these comments is just making me angry.

I hoped you guys enjoyed my writeup of /r/worldpolitics! Hopefully I was able to show some of you what a cesspool this subreddit is.

I think the marijuana + legalize all drugs circlejerk might be my favorite one, as it brings out the Redditors who proudly proclaim that inhaling smoke from a burning plant has no negative side-effects whatsoever. 

Case in point: [this](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1eikhm/study_marijuana_buffers_pain_of_social_exclusion/) post submitted to /r/science links to a news article from the Pacific Standard reporting on how new research shows that marijuana buffers the pain of social exclusion, which might be why a lot of people enjoy it.

This just hits on all the right points. Many Redditors already have no qualms about toking up, but the post offers a way for forever-alone stoners to nod their heads in agreement as their world views are validated once more, without actually reading the dang article.

I'm bad at meeting new people and smoking helped me cope, and also helped me meet people who were similar.](http://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1eikhm/study_marijuana_buffers_pain_of_social_exclusion/ca0lbfv) + 97

It's actually kind of sad to see, because a lot of the commenters in this thread think that the only good way they could be sociable was to toke up with others, instead of engaging in other activities that don't involve smoking. Either that...or they just don't care about the human race and prefer to be left alone:

&gt; [I'm sorry, I disagree, I could give a shit less about feeling like ""I belong"" anywhere. I prefer to be a lone, isolated from the shitty human race we have become and in no way am I ""sad"" about my decision to do so. I'm much happier in fact.](http://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1eikhm/study_marijuana_buffers_pain_of_social_exclusion/ca0lo1p) + 34


But wait! Uh oh! Looks like the article has a quote from a university psychologist who heads one of the research teams saying that:

&gt; Given the drug’s long-term health effects, “This may reflect a poor way of coping""

Now they've gone and done it. Stirred the stoners nest. The same Redditor retaliates:

&gt; [This article reeks of amateurish theory based on inaccurate and obsolete data that has been long proven to be untrue. Though I concede to the point they are making, though poorly made by linking to propaganda based information.](http://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1eikhm/study_marijuana_buffers_pain_of_social_exclusion/ca0lo1p) + 34

One commenter says that pot has actually had the opposite affect, saying that:

&gt; [I quit smoking weed because of how socially anxious it made me](http://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1eikhm/study_marijuana_buffers_pain_of_social_exclusion/ca0lhpp) + 99

Surprisingly, the man isn't bombarded with downvotes, which is either a testament to /u/Khiva's second-option bias, or just the laid-back nature of the stoner.

But there will always be at least *one* person who jumps the gun and lashes out, and in this case it's this lovely chap:

&gt; [I think you should read the article because it's clear you haven't [smoked weed]](http://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1eikhm/study_marijuana_buffers_pain_of_social_exclusion/ca0ludr) + 0

Granted, he concedes to the OP of the comment that he misinterpreted his meaning, but it's clear that the pro-weed bias is strong with this one.

Going further down the thread, we see the oft-repeated quote from Louis Armstrong posted by this highly original Redditor:

&gt; [Louis Armstrong had been quoted as saying marijuana was ""medication to ease the pain of racism.""](http://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1eikhm/study_marijuana_buffers_pain_of_social_exclusion/ca0lc52) + 46

One user replies to this and jerks so hard he almost dies from the joy. The entire comment is pure gold:

&gt; [here's how it goes down with me. I'm hungover; smoke weed. I'm having a panic attack; smoke weed. I'm feeling down in the dumps/depressed; smoke weed. I'm sick/flu/cold; smoke weed. I'm in pain; smoke weed. Broke up with gf; smoke weed. can't sit still/RLS; smoke weed. can't concentrate? smoke weed. lonely? smoke weed feeling great; smoke weed.](http://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1eikhm/study_marijuana_buffers_pain_of_social_exclusion/ca0m6vr) + 9

So anything something bad happens and you can't cope normally, you turn to weed to solve the problem? Sounds like you have an addiction there, friend!

Wait, no he doesn't! He's only smoking sweet, sweet MJ, he's not on any of those *evil* pills!

&gt; [now let me break down the drugs you'd get for all that if you went to the Dr.: Paxil, Welbutrin, Antibiotics, dextromethorphine, oxycontin, xanax/valium/ativan, Ritalin/adderall/Concerta, and any other assortment of absolute bullshit that you'll get addicted to or develop a dependency on for the rest of your life. well god dammit if i'm gonna be on something for the rest of my life, let it be my sweet mistress Mary Jane!](http://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1eikhm/study_marijuana_buffers_pain_of_social_exclusion/ca0m6vr)

And lastly, without fail, the anti-alcohol jerk also shows up:

&gt; [[Louis Armstrong] also said, and I quote, ""It's one-hundred-thousand times better than whisky.""]
(http://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1eikhm/study_marijuana_buffers_pain_of_social_exclusion/ca0m39m) + 15

&gt; [They didn't say alcohol doesn't buffer the pain, either](http://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1eikhm/study_marijuana_buffers_pain_of_social_exclusion/ca0kq3i) + 30

___________

/r/science, ladies and gentlemen: Weed is a wonder drug, alcohol is evil, and the human race is terrible. I think we've covered a lot here today.

The mods were nestled all snug in their beds,

When out on /r/all there arose such a jerk,    
The likes of which would drive any sane person berserk.    
Away to my laptop I flew like a flash,

She’s fat, ugly, and looks like a whore!    
Why won’t girls have sex with me anymore?    

And here come the memes. Dear Science, who will save us all?    
This looks like a job for NDT, Dawkins, Sagan, and Paul!    
My mountain dew, cheetos, and Slayer shirt are ready to go.

A sudden and unexpected smile came across my face.

OP proceeds to do hours and hours of grinding in the game in order to obtain the shiny. 

[And because OP played a video game for hours to make his friend happy, he should be getting laid.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/10onze/i_asked_my_friend_if_she_could_have_any_shiny/c6fajl5)^B

The commenters assume, without any reason, that the OP did this for his friend because he wanted sex/love/affection.^C ^D When, at one point, a user suggests that OP [just might be a nice guy that wanted to make his friend happy](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/10onze/i_asked_my_friend_if_she_could_have_any_shiny/c6ffzmp), someone clarifies that [""no one goes through this much work or makes a post dedicated to his just because""](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/10onze/i_asked_my_friend_if_she_could_have_any_shiny/c6fg6x9)

Don't worry, folks. I'm sure things will end well for OP, when one user points out that [Tiffany *has* to marry the guy that did something nice for her.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/10onze/i_asked_my_friend_if_she_could_have_any_shiny/c6fdmy0)

According to this circlejerk, any major act of kindness towards a female friend is done out of a pursuit for love, sex, or both. Tiffany now owes OP some sort of affection because of his kindness. Of course, since women are evil friendzoning monsters, she probably ended up being with a guy she actually is interested in on her own, *like some whore.*


^A : For those of you unfamiliar with Pokemon games, ""shiny"" Pokemon are super rare versions of the creatures, with a different color scheme. Due to the difficult nature of obtaining them, many consider them valuable.

^B : This is the top voted comment, at the moment.

^C : At no point in the comments does OP say he was or was not pursuing Tiffany.

^D : It's not just a few users assuming this. Many of the heavily upvoted posts mention the friendzone, and ctrl-f searches for ""friendzone"" and ""friend zone"" yield over 35 matches. This, of course, does not include the number of times the friendzone is implied without using the actual term.

1369098574.0,227,self.circlebroke,1eqfg6,A Review of Confession Bear on Advice Animals,desantoos,276,49,137,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1eqfg6/a_review_of_confession_bear_on_advice_animals/,"At the top of Advice Animals today, there's a banner which reads:

&gt;What if I told you that your confession bear memes suck. All of them.

Confession Bear has become so bad, the mods are loudly complaining about it. Here on the Circlebroke family of subs, there have been posts about Confession Bear. Individual posts have been complained about, but I think it is high time someone showed the entirety of Confession Bear, all the terrible posts at once, to show just how godawful that macro has become. As we near 1 year of this macro's dominance in Advice Animals, I present a review:

Like much of the shitty things on Reddit, Confession Bear started with a [lowbrow but acceptable joke](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/vcx7z/i_have_a_lot_of_weird_stuff_that_id_like_to_b/). The comments are playful, with their own confessions. Some people praised it. After all, the OP was sort of funny here, so it fit in with the concept of AdviceAnimals being a sort of (or supposedly) funny subreddit.

However, what Confession Bear has descended into can be made up into four categories:

1. People who are trying hard to get Karma by ""confessing"" to something everybody already likes. This subset has become known as **Popular Opinion Bear** or **Bravery Bear**.
2. People who are complaining about something semi-secretive and think AdviceAnimals is a good place for therapy/relationship advice.
3. People who think Advice Animals is a great place to talk about illegal things you've done.
4. Racists/homophobes/transphobes/sexists who have finally found a way to blare their message across Reddit. Mostly just people trying to be edgy so again it fits the BraveryBear tag.

**Type 1:**
How this category works is that you say something the hivemind already loves. [Example:](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1ep9xy/my_mother_had_a_full_time_job_and_raised_me_on/)
&gt;I hate that stay at home moms claim raising a child is the hardest job/I think it's just an excuse for them not to find a real job

A perfect circlejerk macro that plays right into Reddit's bratty and childfree hivemind. Note that there is no joke here: just a space for someone to preach to the choir. You can scroll through /r/braverybear and find a whole bunch that were pulled out (the best one there is [heavily ironic](http://resme.me/3t0su1.jpg)) that fit this theme. Outside of that sub, here are a few I found from prior posts on the CB network:

&gt;[I like seeing movies normally/than in 3D](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/11554f/i_really_dont_think_its_that_great/)



&gt;[My first thought when I heard Lil Wayne was in critical condition was/
""Great, now when he dies I'll have to listen to idiots call him the best rapper ever.""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1advvh/my_thoughts_on_lil_waynes_recent_seizures/)


&gt;[I HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT BEING IN THE ARMY/THEY SIGNED UP FOR IT, THEY ARE GETTING PAID FOR IT, THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GETTING INTO](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/156utp/i_know_this_will_be_unpopular_but_i_cant_hold_it/)


&gt;[I honestly think/that society would be better if some people weren't allowed to breed](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/163mzg/confession_bear/)

[See also this wonderful synopsis with links to many more of Type 1 confessions.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/10mk2s/confession_bear_or_reddit_i_confess_to_having_the/) One point of emphasis: never is there an attempt at humor on one of these things. Instead, it is people just preaching to the choir.

**Type 2:** I don't know why people think Confession Bear on Advice Animals is the place to air out their troubled past, but for some people it seems to be the case. I get it, they want to confess something that went wrong in your past and they want to get it out there so that they feel better. But they are in Advice Animals!

[Here's one floating to the top right now:](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1eocvv/i_hate_him_and_i_always_will_but_i_cant_bring/)

&gt;Everybody at my school thinks I hate the star quarterback because I am ""jealous"" / I really hate him because one day after working out he sexually assaulted me in the shower.

First off, it's tough stuff to deal with and I hope they get the help they need from people in real life. However, Advice Animals is not the place for these confessions. /r/rapecounseling or /r/confession is a much more suitable alternative. The mods tried to filter this stuff by adding a link to /r/confessionbear, which is a good idea but still just about every day there's a post at the top that just shouldn't be in AdviceAnimals. Because the comments are, except for a few at the top really really terrible. I mean look at the responses to this post:

&gt;[Was it butt stuff or wiener stuff?](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1eocvv/i_hate_him_and_i_always_will_but_i_cant_bring/ca2cjbs)

&gt;[what you need to do is,wait for him to shower again and cut it off. problem solved](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1eocvv/i_hate_him_and_i_always_will_but_i_cant_bring/ca2bock)

Admittedly, there's a lot of good comments there too, but if this person submits to a more niche sub then this person doesn't have to be harassed by terrible comments in a sub with a lassez-faire moderation system.

[Here's another, more tame example example.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1eozsn/nobodys_fault_but_my_own/) Not only is it not funny--which is what I thought was supposed to be the central drive of Advice Animals--but it is not in a good place. /r/sex or /r/relationships can give much better advice and, more importantly, have much more stringent moderation.

[Here's a good post on those that fit this category.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/15gp2m/you_all_saw_this_one_coming_most_recent_meme_on/)

**Type 3**: So far this type has happened maybe a dozen of times from what I've collected. The famous one was [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1btuzb/finally_have_the_guts_to_say_it/). Crime Confession Bear is awful. I don't know what else to say about this one.

**Type 4** Herein lies the latest evolution of Confession Bear: **Xenophobic Bear**. You see, some began to notice that just about any Confession Bear can be upvoted to the top. Here was the perfect opportunity to be racist, sexist, etc. say ""it's all just a joke"" post it like it was a DAE to see other people agree with you, and walk away justified of your prejudices. Here is where the circlejerk stands today.

[Here's an example:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1eonnm/sorry_not_sorry_hopefully_doesnt_make_the_front/)

I love the title, by the way: 
&gt;Sorry not sorry, hopefully doesn't make the front page...

Transphobia is a common theme on Reddit. [Why, just today there was another one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1emv2o/maybe_not_such_a_popular_opinion/)

Confession Bear hates all minorities:
&gt;[WHEN A WOMAN THINKS IT'S OKAY TO CALL ME A DICK/I HAVE NO PROBLEM CALLING HER A CUNT](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1duve9/as_a_man_i_dont_see_a_difference/)

[Here's one that's too long for me to transcribe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1dlajl/when_i_say_this_out_loud_people_assume_im_racist/)

&gt;[AS A LIFEGUARD I HATE IT WHENEVER BLACK KIDS COME INTO THE POOL/BECAUSE THEY GENERALLY CAN'T SWIM, ARE OBNOXIOUS, LOUD, DISRESPECTFUL AND WHENEVER THEY GET YELLED AT THEY PULL THE RACE CARD](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1e5qch/everyone_else_seems_to_obey_the_rules/)

[Here's a book-length one on overweight people.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1dhr92/this_shit_is_getting_out_of_hand/)

&gt;[I DON'T DISLIKE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR SKIN COLOR/I DISLIKE THE WAY THEY BEHAVE AND MOST OF THE TIME IT'S BLACK PEOPLE](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1dauyl/i_always_feel_racist/)


Confession Bear started out as a way to be funny by confessing something true-yet-funny. It has morphed four times, most recently into a way for anyone to spout hateful things on Reddit.

I conclude by going back to the banner. Obviously the mods hate Confession Bear. Maybe, after a year of unfunny posts, Confession Bear needs to go hibernate.

TL;DR Confession bear is unfunny and not in the spirit of the rest of Advice Animals.

It feels good to finally get that off my chest. It was in those comment sections in my early reddit days that I learned the downvote button is only used for when you disagree with someone. I still browse through the articles though since they are usually relevant to the times.

If you have been paying attention to US news this week, you are probably aware of 3 stories: [an IRS scandal which has the Tea Party going apeshit](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/us/politics/irs-scandal-congressional-hearings.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0), [the Department of Justice secretly obtaining phone records of the press](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/govt-obtains-wide-ap-phone-records-probe), and [emails about talking points on Benghazi which implied the administration had knowledge aforethought](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/05/17/get-caught-up-on-benghazi-in-five-short-paragraphs/).

The first two issues are some serious, heavy-duty scandal material about government agencies encroaching on civil liberties or targeting groups based on their politics. As far as Benhazi goes, I'm with David Brooks in thinking it's ""all smoke and no gun,"" but there are rumblings of impeaching Obama about it so it is worth acknowledging. None of these issues cast Obama in a good light, so in the vein of getting to act smug I decided to sort through the top posts in /r/politics to see how far down I had to go for these stories to show up. Clearly the civil-liberties jerk would have rocketed this shit straight to the top posts for the past week. However, reddit did not disappoint my thirst for complaining material.

Of the top 6 posts, 3 are about [Elizabeth Warren](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/05/elizabeth-warren-obama-put-bad-banks-trial) hating [banks](http://www.addictinginfo.org/2013/05/16/elizabeth-warren-demands-full-prosecutionjail-for-big-bank-criminals/) (with a bonus [student loan](http://www.thenation.com/article/174316/elizabeth-warren-great-investment?utm_source=feedly#) jerk), one is about employers [not paying a living wage](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/15/1209224/-Milwaukee-makes-five-cities-so-far-Fast-food-workers-strike-for-higher-pay-and-union-rights?detail=hide#), one is about [police brutality](http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/349894), and the top post is Sen. Franken wanting to [regulate credit rating agencies](http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/05/14/sen-al-frankens-plan-to-prevent-the-next-financial-meltdown-a-clean-up-of-the-credit-rating-system/). 

All good issues I suppose, but all are off the national radar. We have to get to post #7 to find anything about the real meat and potatoes. Unfortunately it's about the dumbest of the three issues and how reddit's favorite Republican John McCain went on TV this one time and said he [won't support impeaching the president over Benghazi](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/12/mccain-obama-benghazi_n_3262489.html)... yet. The post has little substance, but at least they link to some good articles. Top comment?

&gt;He may be a grouchy old shithead, but he is not stupid.

Thanks for the hard-hitting commentary, bro.

Next stop for the #realtalk is at post #16. It's an article on the IRS scandal, and how [it's actually about fraudulent superPACs and murky campaign-finance laws](http://www.mintpressnews.com/inappropriate-criteria-inadequate-management-to-blame-for-irs-fiasco/). But before you get there you have to be reminded that [weed should be legal](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/capital-cannabis-medical-marijuana-dispensary-open-capitol-hill/story?id=19166101#.UZezD6K-rz4), a Florida teen is being [persecuted for doing (*gasp*) SCIENCE](http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/05/15/charges-dropped-against-florida-teen-over-amateur-science-experiment/), and that there are these evil things called [student loans](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=C959DC0B-7D8C-4AAE-8FBF-DF74791B8A26) which cost money.

Onward we go to the next post about the IRS scandal at #24, but it's an article about the REAL IRS scandal, [churches endorsing political candidates](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/05/16/the-other-irs-scandal/) (which they are not allowed to do and retain their tax status). gOD forbid some fundie asshole listens to an important leader in their community when going to the polls.

You don't get to the phone records scandal until #26, but at least that is a [good and relevant article.](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/govt-obtains-wide-ap-phone-records-probe) The [comment section](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1e9mkj/the_justice_department_secretly_obtained_two/) isn't *total* dogshit, either. I wish I had more to complain about.

What is particularly aggravating to me about posts #7, 16, and 24 is that they are deflective, and not about the actual issue. 7 is a statement of support for Obama, not about the scandal. 16 is related to the issue but ultimately about campaign finance. 24 is about the tax status of churches, the real issue only gets a brief mention in the intro. If you keep scrolling you get to more awesome gems like [Michele Bachmann is acting crazy](http://www.thedailydolt.com/2013/05/12/michele-bachmann-claims-911-benghazi-were-judgment-from-god/) about Benghazi at #41 and more [""the REAL IRS scandal""](http://thecontributor.com/real-irs-scandal-agency-audits-found-wealthy-taxpayers-failed-pay-48-billion-taxes) at #43.

I haven't been able to bring myself to start filtering /r/politics ... but I'm real fucking close. Also this is my [f]irst post so please be gentle with your smug.

(And some changes in policy.),dhamster,266,37,159,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/19l9nv/celebrating_one_year_of_circlebroke_and_some/,"As of today Circlebroke has been around for a whole year! Thanks to everyone who has kept this place going, either by contributing, moderating or lurking. For a glimpse into the distant past, you can check out Stattit's ""time machine"" view of CB from [March 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/by_id/t3_qg9ku) and [March 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/by_id/t3_qgm2w,t3_qhabb,t3_qhpuv,t3_qgx62,t3_qh798,t3_qgqoo,t3_qgp72,t3_qgpfn,t3_qgxgo,t3_qgx15,t3_qh2j2) of last year, when /r/circlejerk was still [totally in shock](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/qf9s6/it_has_been_fun_everyone_but_its_over_well_just/) over last year's [Faces of Atheism](http://www.reddit.com/tb/qej8n) fad.  
  
Anyway, I'm going to take this opportunity to make a few small-to-largeish announcements:  
  
* **Quantifying Effort:** A Suggested Minimum Post Length. *(It's shorter than you think. Seriously!)*  
* **Introducing /r/Openbroke** *(A new home for Circlebroke posts pertaining to issues such as racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry on reddit)*  
* **Minor Rules Tweaks and Consolidations** *(Annotated with some explanations)*   
* **Year 2 Survey**
     
***   
  
**A SUGGESTED MINIMUM POST LENGTH:**   
  
Are you ready? Wait for it...  
  
* At least six sentences, and two or more examples from reddit.  
  
We'll probably play around with this number a bit in the future, but the point is that we want to make it clear that shorter posts are OK.  
  
We used to throw around the ""Low Effort"" tags a lot, and it's scared people into thinking that every post to CB has to be a novel. It really doesn't. It should have enough meat to **set up** a discussion, but it doesn't need to be so long that the OP tries to have the **entire discussion by himself** in his submission. That can be a chore to read if it's not well-written, and it often shifts the focus of the comments from talking about the linked content to picking apart the OP.  
  
A lot of people are afraid to post outside of Low Effort Friday, but we've found that a lot of submissions made on LEF aren't all that bad. So we looked at a few of the better LEF-type post and found that 6 sentences and two examples isn't a bad lower bound on effort.  
  
Also, we're going to retire ""Low Effort"" flair from now on. If your post is borderline and we want you to elaborate on your post, the mods will come in with a comment to ask you to add some more detail instead of slapping on the flair.   
  
* **TL;DR:** Your posts can be as short as six sentences now. Effort is not the same thing as quality. 
  
 (But they are correlated.)   
  
***  
  
**INTRODUCING /R/OPENBROKE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE TOPICS**  
  
Racism, sexism and other forms of bigotry have been persistent issues on reddit for a long time, and as a result they have been among the most popular topics of discussion on CB. They're also among the most contentious topics, and have a tendency to attract trolling and heated debate. For these reasons and to preserve variety we have tried to restrict these ""social justice""-type issues to a weekly megathread, but as a long-term solution the megathread is clunky and labor-intensive.  
  
There's a lot of interest in social justice discussion in the CB environment, so we figured that it's probably the right time to bring it to its own spinoff subreddit, /r/openbroke. The format and guidelines are more or less the same there as they are here, except we will be keeping a closer eye on some of the more toxic behavior that tends to show up whenever racism gets discussed on reddit. Have fun!   
  
* **TL;DR:** /r/Openbroke is now ready to go as Circlebroke's venue for discussions on racism, sexism and related topics.  
  
***  
  
**RULES REVISIONS, CONSOLIDATION**  
  
Our ruleset has grown many times in response to issues that have cropped up on the sub, but it has become clunky and redundant in parts. I've shaved things down a bit, and we will continue to revise things in the future.  
  
Below is our edited ruleset, with annotations to describe the reasoning behind each rule.   
  
**RULE**                  | **NOTES** 
|:--|:--
Linked content must be indicative of general trends on reddit. We ask that comments discuss reddit instead of the topic of reddit's discussion. | This defines what is on-topic in the subreddit. ""This post is bad"" is less interesting to us than ""This post is an example of (some pervasive trend on reddit)."" In addition, we ask that commenters avoid discussing the *topic* of discussion, and instead focus on *reddit's treatment of that topic*.  We're here to discuss how \/r/atheism treats atheism, for example, *not* the legitimacy of atheism itself.
The title and body of your post must be detailed enough to encourage a discussion. We suggest that your post contain at least 6 sentences, supported by 2 or more examples from reddit. | See my thoughts above.
Do not vote on linked threads, or comment on them with the intention of mocking, provoking or insulting other users. Normal, constructive comments on linked threads are fine. | Seriously, don't do this. Circlebroke is not the Reddit Police - don't go around disrupting, downvoting, or trolling linked threads. The mods can only do so much to counteract this, but if you see this happening, tell us and we will warn or ban the offending users.
Please link to www.np.reddit.com instead of www.reddit.com. Do not link to usernames with the intent of targeting specific users. | This is an extension of the ""don't shit up linked threads"" rule noted above. 
Be civil. Excess hostility and fighting words will get you banned. | If you aren't civil to other users on here, you're making everyone's experience worse. We will ban users for fighting words and name calling, and reserve the right to warn or temporarily ban them for more passive-aggressive forms of hostility.
Vote based on quality. Do not downvote a post solely because you disagree with it. | If the community votes responsibly, it allows for a diversity of opinions to exist on reddit. No big subreddit seems to be able to reign in opinion-voting, including circlebroke.  Please *try*, at least.
Please keep cliched \/r/circlejerk-style comments to a low roar. | It's OK to be silly, but don't go overboard with buzzwords and hilarious catch-phrases like ""[le]terally"" and ""[f]irst post be gent[le]."" And don't get snippy at each other for flouting this rule, just use the report button if you think someone is overdoing it.
Bots, throwaways, new users and in-character novelty accounts may be banned without explanation. | We have had issues with users using sockpuppets or circumventing bans in the past. We don't enforce this often, but use your main account to be safe. 
Posts regarding racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry on reddit belong in /r/openbroke. | See above.
Meta threads belong in /r/CirclebrokeDiscussion unless approved by the mods. Comments that derail threads with whiny meta-discussion will be removed unless they contribute novel or useful ideas. Be constructive. | CB is for talking about reddit, CBD is for talking about CB. If all you're going to add to the thread is a totally original comparison of CB to SRS or the really unique observation that ""CB is the real circlejerk,"" it will probably be removed. Unless your criticism is constructive, it's off-topic.   
  
* **TL;DR:** Andreev bound states are a key concept in mesoscopic superconductivity as they provide a universal description of Josephson-like effects in quantum-coherent nanostructures connected to superconducting leads.  
  
***  
  
**YEAR 2 SURVEY**  
  
Some of the other mods wanted to have another survey. Well, why not? Fill out the form [here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UDHm-AeOH7yZxGKlYGMon-NqDWS8bLtz9mW3TEfhgHM/viewform) We'll probably present the results next week or so.  
  
* **TL;DR[^\*](http://www.reddit.com/r/dotmancopypasta/new/):** They say that prisons, they just aren't working. The criminal goes in, he comes out and he hasn't changed a lick. If anything he's more hardened, he's more isolated from society. Prisons are just not working as a form of rehabilitation.   
  
 What we need is to have new forms of punishment. I think one of the best punishments we could offer would be a lifetime sentence where whenever the criminal sends a text message or an email, they can only write it in all upper case letters. Here's the catch. They can never explain to anyone that they have no choice but to write in all capital letters. So it will always look like they are yelling at someone and they can never, ever explain that they have no choice. That they can't use upper and lower case, they can only use upper case.   
  
 So then if they go to a party and if they see a friend, and their friend was like ""Hey - why did you send me that message in all uppercase letters? Did I do something wrong?"" the prisoner would have to be like ""No.""

I'll often look up the history of the most asinine commenters just to get a sense of the kind of person they are, how they think, what shapes their views, etc.  Well, today I stumbled upon a gold mine.

My curiosity was piqued by this comment in which TheWillMan argues that we should abolish credit scores because [""I certainly don't think that we should treat those people any different from anyone else just because they've had financial trouble.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/w564g/time_to_get_crazy_civilizations_in_the_final/c5ah9g6)  As a jerk, it's hilarious but not wholly extraordinary.  Surely, I thought, this person has never been within 500 feet of an economics textbook.

But wait, in his comment history he states that he was an [economics major](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/qg270/it_is_no_crime_to_be_ignorant_of_economics/c3xd5zm).  Now that's an interesting twist, given that his other comments indicate complete ignorance of basic economic reality.  How does a person manage to get through a whole degree and pick up so little?

[Here's a fascinating clue, and truly one of my favorite comments of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/qg270/it_is_no_crime_to_be_ignorant_of_economics/c3xd8zk):

&gt;&gt;""In my Economics classes I have finals where I have to explain why globalization (in the neoliberal sense, like NAFTA and similar treaties) benefits all classes of workers in all countries. It is made clear that if you argue to the contrary that you will receive a failing grade since such a viewpoint isn't accepted in the economics community.

&gt;&gt;It's pretty interesting to watch a class of privileged kids write that the starving Mexican farmers that were bankrupted when they were no longer protected by more efficient and subsidized corn farmers in Iowa are being helped by NAFTA.

&gt;&gt;Economics is a joke.

&gt;&gt;Edit: Since I'm getting a lot of feedback focusing on the fact that I was explicitly instructed to argue one side of an issue, just wanted to say that's sort of missing the point I'm trying to make. **In the self-enclosed world of economic models and theory the professor is basically right in saying that you can't argue for the other side.** I'm not supposed to argue from an empirical basis, and according to the models globalization is good for everyone.

&gt;&gt;To relate this back to the original post, arguing from economics implies ignoring our natural level-headed empiricism in favor of abstraction. **If I argued strictly from economics (that is, theory and models) that globalization was bad then I would get my ass handed to me by anyone that knows their shit.** But tell that to a steel worker from Pennsylvania or a an autoworker from Flint, MI.""

What a _fascinating_ specimen this is.  Here, the commenter all but completely acknowledges that a professional academic with more knowledge that he on the subject would _wipe the floor with him_ and yet he insists on being right nonetheless, and that ""economics is a joke.""

It gets better.

If you didn't know, the fifteenth anniversary of the first Harry Potter book is coming up. What was that book called again? Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, if you are a superior European Harry Potter fan. If you live in lowly America, you are simply to dense to understand what the word philosopher even means, which is why our gracious overlords had to translate that into Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone.

Now, as an American, I have no idea what a philosopher even is. Hell, I only got to the 3rd grade (which is the equivalent of European 1st grade). As I try to flesh out this jerk, please be gent[le] and keep in mind I am only an American.

&gt;Philosopher's Stone damn it!

Sitting at #1 is this post, expressing the users anger at this disgusting name change, which took place over a decade ago. 

In reply to her, we have this lowly American trying to make up for his ignorance.

&gt;American here. I made sure I got the right version of the movie, after having gotten it wrong on the book.

Im sure your movie experience was completely different with the superior European version. 

&gt;it's PHILOSOPHER. not SORCERER.
bloody hell. i know they enjoy changing words around for different audiences but what's wrong with philosopher? is it too long or something?
i mean, Pythagoras, we've all heard of Pythagoras. famous greek philosopher. or at least, he's a philosopher where i'm from. Is he a fucking sorcerer now? because he wasn't a bloody wizard.
I'm overreacting but i don't give a poo. PHILOSOPHY FTW

When I got to this thread this was in the negatives, and then it shot up to the #4 position. 

The best response is this.

&gt;Teen Mutant Hero Turtles.
Because British people don't understand what a ""ninja"" is.

Could it be? Could the most superior of peoples not understand something!?

&gt;Nope, that change was made across most of Europe because ninja was thought to be a word that was too violent for kids. We changed back to ninja in 2003. Wikipedia FUCK YEAH!

Damn, I almost thought we had got them there. 

&gt;why is it called the sorcerer's stone in americs?

This brilliant poster is asking a very insightful and often overlooked change to the title. 

He gets an answer that is the highlight of the thread

&gt;Because Scholastic the US publishers thought American kids wouldn't understand the word ""philosopher"". They bugger up British books all time, I have heard that The Hobbit, or ""Little Person"" in the US, has Bilbo (renamed as Brandon) drive to the Misty Mountain in his Camero, and talk to Smaug (Dwayne T Dragon) resulting in a long lasting friendship and some hugging.

I don't remember that part of The Hobbit. 

To further this point, and make sure we understand why these changes were made, this user chimes in.

&gt;that's because our schools suck so bad kids can't read

And yet, assuming you are American, you went to these schools. 

The next post, sitting at 0 points.

&gt;I think that American Publishers had elected to use ""Sorcerer's"" Stone because of marketing. It ""sounds better"" to say (Americans love alliteration) and it more readily gets the magic theme across as a philosopher does not do magic.

Hmm, this sounds too reasonable. 

&gt;But the Philosopher's Stone is a thing (it's one of the goals of alchemy), whereas the Sorcerer's Stone is some made-up thing that isn't even mentioned in the book.

As if the Philosophers Stone is any more real than the Sorcerers Stone. 

&gt;My book says Philosophers. This is rubbish.

Very simple. Very British. I love it.

Oh man, this one is just BEAUTIFUL:
&gt;Hi reddit,
&gt;This post and some of the replies actually made me want to login.
&gt;Anyway people making broad generalizations about various things makes me mad.
I've lived most of my life in Australia where there are many programs for people who genuinely need help. I've seen people beg for money, one such person I saw one day get into a damn brand new $50,000+ car and drive the fuck off in his begging clothes. Lets just say when ever I walked past this dude begging on the street; I kicked his cardboard sign down the street and be damned what the tourists thought!
However there was a few people in the CBD who really did need help. I always gave those guys a few dollars as I passed, when I had change. One time I had a big night with some buddies and won a poker game. This homeless dude I had watch deteriorate over a few years got most of that the next morning when I walked past (I still covered my costs, im no saint). There was some news paper article about him one time too, I guess a journalist had noticed him too. Poor guy was fighting (or tried too) the government about something in court and got taken to the cleaners.
&gt;Anyway now that I am living in SF, damn there are so many homeless and mentally ill people (I swear it feels like 25% of the people here are in poverty). I have no idea how to work out if people are for real or just trying to scam me. Unfortunately I think most of them are really mentally ill or in need. I give a few $ where I can, but if I gave everyone a few dollars I would be out about $50-100 before I walked to where I work once I got off bart.
I lament the fact that America is so arse backwards in so many damn socially acceptable things elsewhere in the world. Healthcare being god damn number 1. Healthy people pay taxes and work until retirement. Others being public transport (SF is pretty good though), banking (who the fuck uses checks people!), freeways, I thought your freeways were meant to awesome... they are full of fucking holes. I could go on somewhat about this topic. But I wont.
&gt;I don't think the OP gives atheists specifically a good name. Everyone is capable of what the OP did. They just choose not too, either through social conditioning or ignorance. That said people in this social group tend to be more enlightened and open to various lines of thought and reasoning.
Also labeling those people who shunned the OP is fucking stupid. They're just ignorant and stereotyping people. Much like the majority of you are here.
You know what would help fix this; If instead of walking away or applying said labels to people, when they look at you and shake their heads... Ask them politely why they think what you did was wrong. Offer an alternative point of view if they're listening. Their parents or friends probably never did.

. . .but this one is even better!

&gt;I've done this countless times, and only a few times have I gotten weird reactions from onlookers (and once a friend, with whom I am not longer associated). A guy was sitting on the sidewalk in downtown Orlando, it was freezing out (yes, it does get cold in Florida). I was with a few friends on our way to a concert (Mindless Self Indulgence) at The Social. I went over and asked if he was okay, if there was anything I could do for him. He gave me a pretty standard sounding sob story, which always gets me, but the thing that really hit me was when he said he was really just saving up for a pair of work boots and a tool belt so he could start working independent construction again, as he knows a person who runs a local business.
&gt;So, I asked him what size shoe, took him to a Subway in the area, got him some food and asked him to wait there. I came back with boots in his size and a tool belt. I gave him an extra $50 and said that should get him at least a tool or two to start. He told me he couldn't accept any of this, so I tell him I still lived at home, had two jobs and my writing, I was doing alright, so I could handle doing this. The guy started crying in the Subway and gave me probably the most passionate hug I've ever been given where both parties were still wearing clothes. I embrace it, but honestly never felt like I'll hear from this guy ever again.
&gt;I gave him my card (I was a self righteous writer so I used to carry business cards, but no more) and it had my (now defunct) e-mail, (now defunct) cell number and various internet presences printed on it (with MySpace listed first, because this was maybe six years ago when I was 20 or 21). Maybe three months later I get a call from the guy asking me if I wanted to meet him for lunch at the Subway. I figured why the hell not, it's only a fifty or so minute drive and he gave me a few days notice.
&gt;I head out to find he's working and staying with two of the guys from the local contractor company he was employed with. That he was doing better than he had in a long time. The fact that he wasn't just fucking with me and instead actually put that money to use was amazing. He even brought the tool belt and most of his equipment with him to show me. The guy was somewhere between 50-55, so seeing someone of his age light up with the glee of a child showing off his newest toy was the coolest thing I'd ever witnessed.
I've done smaller things for people in similar situations since then, though my income is next to nothing now so I can't afford to be extravagant with my gestures anymore (economy, blah blah blah), but this is still my go to story whenever a similar topic arises (or if I want to impress a woman I'm courting).

Another self-congratulatory jerk, with an even juicier response:

&gt;I hate that towns like this exist. You are 100% right, and while I'm sure you already know that, it's important for you to know that you're not the only one out there. I live in a small town in Michigan and I haven't experienced a ton of homeless people locally, but I still donate (actually my shitty minimum wage job does awesome work for them) to the local food bank. Over 3000 families use it.
&gt;Non-locally, I've taken several trips into Chicago and I don't care how many people tell me homeless people could work, are making good money, or are just gonna buy booze - I don't give a shit and I can't tell the difference. If my $2 buys them a burger or a beer, I don't care. He'll sleep better either way. Specifically, one of the reasons my boyfriend and I don't plan on having children is so that we have more available money to donate. This is why.Man should take care of man, plain and simple. The people who gave you dirty looks are too fucking stupid and selfish to realize this, and if there is a god, I'm sure he's very disappointed in his children who behave that way.
&gt;Edit: To expand on my shitty minimum wage job, because I think they deserve recognition- I work at Kohl's, an American department store. So long as they can get just 5 employees (usually easy) to donate 3 hours each per month, Kohl's corporate will donate $500 per month to that organization. We regularly have 3 or 4 groups that we work with per month, and have a year long contract with the aforementioned food bank. Specifically what this means, is they are absolutely getting $500/month because if they can't get enough employees to do their 3 hours (which I've never seen happen) then the managers do it. The food bank told us that $500/month will stock their shelves. This is why I can go to work and sell shoes every day.

and the icing on the cake:

&gt;I think it would be a shame for people as altruistic as you to not have kids.

The bravery here is off the charts! Or something

&gt;I was in a similar situation about 6 yrs ago.I was nine months pregnant,standing in line at Quizno's.It was PACKED.I too live in a small right wing christian town in the south so the room was presumably full of ""christians.""In front me of was a filthy elderly man who had clearly not eaten in quite a while.He says to the lady,""I don't have any $ but could you please make me a sandwich,I'm very hungry."" She said she was sorry but she couldn't and told him to come back in an hr when her manager would be there. I look around at all the people in the room,all who will be going back to their homes..and kitchens full of food.No one is offering help and some even snicker in disgust.The man says ""Ok,god bless"" and walks out.I was next in line,I quickly order him a sandwich and run,pregnant and all,out to the parking lot to find him.He was gone.I looked all over.I spent at least 30 mins driving around the area looking.I was so upset with myself for not screaming at him to wait before he walked out.I couldn't find him so instead I walked back into Quizno's and gave the sandwich back to the girl and told her if he came back to give it to him.Everyone when realizing the sandwich I had ordered had been for the homeless man, just looked at me like I was some kind of degenerate.More than likely I was the only atheist in that room,and I was also the only one who tried to help.
&gt;TL;DR:Ran after a homeless man ,while 9 mths pregnant, with a sandwich after a room full of (presumably) christians ignored him.


I'm sorry, I keep saying this, but as I scroll down the comments I keep telling myself it couldn't get any worse. Sadly, it does:

&gt;Move the fuck out of America dude or at the very least, where you are now, the rest of the world is leaving those nutcases to rot. Seriously, I live in the UK and Reddit is virtually the only place I hear of US politics/issues/debates (and we are two of the closest allies apparently). Even the most staunch right wing conservatives here from the old private schools think the people you've described are bat-shit crazy and are fine with abortion and contraception and the rules around rape etc. etc. etc.
&gt;Seriously, do yourself a favour. I've been to America and places like that are like a bubble. No-one has passports, no-one's been abroad, no-one can speak another language. They socialize with people like them and wallow in their hate and anger. Let them die alone and cold and never let them get to you.

&gt;Same age, same army, and I've seen, done, and feel the same way. When did the religious become the bullies, and the ""godless"" become the samaritans.

&gt;It is people like you who encourage me to be a better person and to treat others the way I would like to be treated.

I don't know people were still using this expression non-sarcastically:

&gt;You're a gentleman and a scholar. Kudos. There's no reason anyone should go hungry.

Just by examining the title, any slightly cynical redditor can quickly identify a fertile circlejerk breeding ground, and a quick trip to the comments does not disappoint. I am a frequent visitor to r/circlebroke but seldom post, however this thread hurt my brain so my that I had to rage it out here.

[Let's take a look at the first comment, at 1200+ upvotes](http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1hgant/police_arrest_man_for_filming_raid_then_shoot_his/cau1p79). I literally cannot believe that someone wrote this. The first time I read through, I truly believed that this human is one of the most talented trolls of all time. No circlejerk element is missing here: we've got Norway, trigger-happy American police, potential psychopathy, snide remarks about inferior non-EU countries, blatant generalizations, and, for the icing on this shit cake, an appeal to reddit to ""Turn things around this time"". I just. can't. even. comprehend. that. sentence.

Looking down just that one comment thread, we see some appeals to reason (""That's not true at all. The stories that reach this front page are the stories of a cop fucking up, not the stories of how cops save lives every day. Don't generalize.""), that have popped into existence as the thread has become more public. These are largely ignored compared to the [sentiments](http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1hgant/police_arrest_man_for_filming_raid_then_shoot_his/cau299k) that agree with the parent.

When a user [mentions](http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1hgant/police_arrest_man_for_filming_raid_then_shoot_his/cau17b4) that the video was taken down and the OP's account was deactivated or whatever, reddit is quick to ragejerk about everything from oppressive moderation to the fucking NSA into the discussion. From a quick glance, [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1hgant/police_arrest_man_for_filming_raid_then_shoot_his/cau2dx1) post wins takes the dumbass cake, even though it is only slightly upvoted. It does bear mentioning that Rule III, clearly posted in the sidebar, offers at least a substrate to explain the removal of the original post, but that of course is not enough for the rabid horde, who all clearly know how to moderate a large community. 

There's plenty more circlebroke fodder in this thread, and I don't need to put up every single instance of complete idiocy. This thread really fundamentally bothered me in a way that no other ridiculous instance of redditor ignorance has, primarily because of how clearly it shows that most redditors are so out of touch with any semblance of reality, yet still feel that they can project their limited worldview onto any given circumstance. Even more disturbing than this is how they think they are ALWAYS RIGHT. I'm not claiming to be a wizened monk myself, but I have enough real-world experience to know that if I was in that cop's shoes, in the middle of a huge fucking raid, with some crazy dude shouting at and filming me, and then his big ass rottweiler jumps OUT OF THE CAR WINDOW and makes any kind of aggressive moves at me, I'm going to shoot. It's very sad that the dog had to die, but it's a natural response to a potentially severe bodily threat, and the fact that there are redditors that say the cop should be killed for his actions makes me lose a bit of faith in humanity.

He wasn't even accused of anything! This is his own paranoia at work here!

Anyway it just keeps going.

But stealing their money is good because they were trying to break the law!

&gt; Good deed as in depriving those kids the ability to get beer and tobacco. Those things are illegal for them for a reason. And not only did he not buy it for them, but by keeping the money, OP also made sure they won't be able to for some time.

.

&gt; Fun fact: This probably doubles as a good deed too.

.

&gt; Not debatable at all. The kids were attempting to enter into an agreement to commit a crime.

.

&gt; Bad and good. You stole their money but didn't break the law and let little kids drink alcohol that they're not allowed to drink.

Let's not forget half of these guys are probably swapping tips in /r/trees about how not to get busted for possession.

One reader is downvoted for suggesting

&gt; He could have refused to buy them alcohol, and not taken their money.

Next, the internet lawyers get in on the act

&gt; Bad wording on his part. He actually didn't steal it. They consciously gave it to him, so it's not illegal for him to walk off with it.

.

&gt; actually no law was broken, because no valid contract was made: one cannot legally enter a contract which would require the party to violate a law. Ergo, the fronting of the money by the idiot chillens constitutes only a gratuitous gift, ie, not a law. At least in the American legal system, but this area of law is roughly similar to that of European countries (someone standardized by the UN)

Right, because that's exactly what'd happen. [The highest-voted reply to this is actually a good post](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17pdii/this_is_not_happening/c87oqfb).

This thread was posted on /r/todayilearned. Can we guess the top comment?

1. IQ isn't an accurate measure of intelligence anyway.

2. Um...Sadly, I agree with this policy.

3. This is disgusting I'm glad we stopped this barbaric practice.

Of course, the correct top comment is number 2 as Reddit praises the old pro-eugenics literally Hitler jerk once again.

&gt;Absolutely. Kids can't vote, why should retards and blacks?

Other posters much farther down have pointed out that this user posts to white rights and white power subreddits, and he is in fact not joking. 

There are even more enlightened comments, however. For example:

&gt;Like toothbrush moustaches, eugenics was popular until it became associated with the Nazis.

Gosh darn, why do the Nazis always have to ruin the good stuff in life like forcibly operating on people less euphoric than myself? (Note this also touches on the beard/moustache jerk, that is, toothbrush moustaches being considered 'cool')

Just so we're clear. This is also my first circlebroke post*

Christianity isn't the most well-loved thing here on Reddit, and as such, every time the religion gets some negative press, Redditors every where collectively jerk with wild abandon. 

[This](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1egr1w/christianity_could_be_facing_a_catastrophic/) post here (currently sitting at a pretty 848 upvotes at the time of this writing) in /r/worldnews links to an article from The Telegraph that reports on the decline of Christianity in Great Britain. Redditors from all over flock to celebrate that their oppression from the evil fundies is coming to an end.

&gt; [And the inevitable rise of atheism. Its evolution man](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1egr1w/christianity_could_be_facing_a_catastrophic/ca0aqcf) + 2

But if you actually read the article, the decline in Christianity comes from an increase in Islam. Quote from the article: 

&gt; While almost half of British Muslims are under the age of 25, almost a quarter of Christians are over 65.
The average age of a British Muslim is just 25, not far off half that of a British Christian.

But fear not! [Most young Muslims in Britain are becoming less Muslim and more British, so it's all good](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1egr1w/christianity_could_be_facing_a_catastrophic/ca051uy) (+37).

The circlejerk continues with a Redditor commenting about how even his mother, who had a strict Catholic upbringing, came to the conclusion that it's foolish to believe in a God. 

&gt; [As a Brit, I very rarely meet anyone who is a devout Christian anymore. Even my mum who was brought up a strict catholic agrees there is just so much information these days about evolution and the universe that it is foolish to truly believe in a god](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1egr1w/christianity_could_be_facing_a_catastrophic/ca08xqk) + 10

One brave Redditor makes a [poor comment about Islam taking over](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1egr1w/christianity_could_be_facing_a_catastrophic/ca02efb) instead, and is bombarded with well deserved downvotes. But he is also met with this response:

&gt; [Or secular humanism [will take over]. The abandonment of ancient superstitions for a more logical, reason based belief structure is a natural process for an advanced civilization.](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1egr1w/christianity_could_be_facing_a_catastrophic/ca02efb) + 32

DAE think abolishing religion will bring a world utopia??!

And this is all not even mentioning the poor understanding of basic theology pervades so many of the comments. 

&gt; [Yes. My family is very devout and fundamentalist, but I am no longer. Tell me what part of God making the Earth in 6 days, all the animals, plants, stars, EVERYTHING just appearing in 6 days syncs up with evolution?](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1egr1w/christianity_could_be_facing_a_catastrophic/ca0bgr4). 

Granted, these sort of comments are at negative karma or simply at 1, with a few commenters calling them out.

I think my favorite comment, however, is this little nugget:

&gt; [Atheists need to realize 1 important thing demographics is destiny. End immigration from the third world, start reproducing in higher numbers](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1egr1w/christianity_could_be_facing_a_catastrophic/ca080oc) - 4

Progressive insurance has made an advertisement that puts Flo into a meme. 

As seen [here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/1bjm3b/it_doesnt_work_like_that/)

First off the bat, who could really blame them? I imagine some internet conscious 27 year old male at a board meeting saying ""hey they are these things on the web that people like and maybe we could turn Flo into one? It won't even cost us that much money to do!"" I don't even think they put this on TV but I cannot be sure of that. 

The majority of the reaction seems to be along the lines of:

These horrible ha[le] corporate suckers trying to use something that WE made and turn it back against us? NO WAY. Le reddit army won't stand for this! 

This is the cringe subreddit so you know people are oozing into their seats, having their testicles retract because this is so god awful, no seriously, a post from a mod on there that is currently numero uno:

&gt; I actually felt my balls shrivel up into my pelvic cavity as I watched this. Seal of approval'd.

+352

Is it that bad? I mean a freaking 20 second long clip, not even? Those 30 second clips on TV of Flo are much worse in my opinion. 

But wait, there's more!

&gt; Hmm... first the puckered anus, now the shriveled testes. The Cringe is mutating.

+116

I don't understand reddit's fascination with describing in as lurid detail as possible what is figuratively ([Le]terally any1???) happening to them while watching these oh so horrible videos. 

&gt; Her face just perfectly encapsulates the feeling of every marketing executive who is desperate to reach this new generation that's way less responsive to advertizing than the previous one. Imagine how many people this idea went through, and no one picked up on how bad of an idea it would be. Out of touch doesn't even begin to say it.

+322

Why is this such a bad idea? I think it is a good idea to be frank, but that is just me. Neither one of my testicles retracted back into my pelvic cavity as a watched this so perhaps I didn't 'get it?' What is so freakin' bad about an ad agency trying to tap a market? Isn't this Merica' and freedom and that whole jerk? 

Desperate to reach a new generation? He is acting like these ad agencies are up in arms like : ""we must reach this reddit population! there impact is far too great on the world for us to miss out on, I want a dozen of these me-mes on my desk by tomorrow, PRONTO!"" 

You are not that important, none of us are. This is a simple cheap ad that is probably effective now that is has spread across le cringe like wildfire and has gotten a mods 'seal of approval' 

I gotta point out that a fair amount of people realized how ridiculous this whole jerk is:

&gt; Or maybe it was a really good idea... after all 160,000 views is a lot of free advertising.

But still, I'll leave you with this to try and encapsulate this whole thing

&gt; I burst out laughing for a whole minute when I saw the second highest comment on youtube was ""This gave me bumhole aids."" and then scrolled back up and noticed that it was the official Progressive channel. That brave comment will probably be seen by at least a few stockholders.

So upset that they document the offending material and go home to post in on /r/gaming so the rest of their brethren can comment about how this is a crime against humanity and how it's gotten out of control.

This week's le gem:

http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/19gkth/more_ridiculous_angry_birds_related_products/

Let's conveniently ignore the gigantic piles of Mario merchandise we were bombarded with as kids because Mario is sacred and he would never milk us for our money, it's only gone *too far* when it's something modern kids enjoy. 

Here are some of the standout comments in the thread so far:

&gt; *I saw a child wearing a angry birds hat this morning, I was disappointed.*

FUCKING KIDS, why don't they wear pikachu t-shirts instead? Faith in humanity = LOST.

&gt; *Aren't they making a TV show AND a movie?*

He says it like the concept of [making a TV show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_N:_The_Game_Master) and/or a [movie out of a popular video game franchise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros._(film)) is somehow new.

&gt; *There is also Angry Birds shampoo and smoothies here in Finland. It certainly is getting quite ridiculous.*

[Clearly it has.](http://i.imgur.com/OY2wYt6.jpg)

&gt; *I think Angry Birds have died*

That's why we're getting an Angry Birds movie, right?

I've played Angry Birds, usually on the bus or when I'm waiting for my wife outside the dressing room and they're entertaining for being simple 99 cent (often free) games. I'm 100% sure that if the NES generation had grown up with Angry Birds everyone would be circlejerking about how they ""miss this little guy"" or how we need an HD remake of these games. I should also warn you that you'll find me in that thread bitching people out.

Fuck kids who grow up with something other than what we grew up with, right? BTW this is my first circlebroke post. HOW DID I DO, REDDIT? HOW DID I DO? HOW DID I DO? DID I DO GOOD?

Hello all. It's probably been like 6-9 months since my last CB post, but I felt a bit inclined to post one when I saw some of the comments on this thread....a thread that I made, actually. Hopefully I'm not breaking some sort of cardinal rule by posting about my own thread, but I suppose I'm a bit biased.

Tl;dr is that my boyfriend is a pretty picky eater, and I made a thread in /r/Cooking looking for some new recipe ideas. And there were some legitimate responses that were helpful, but I also received some interesting and unsolicited (and frankly, not very helpful) relationship advice, that honestly, I found sort of hilarious. Observe. 

&gt; Cook what you want and tell him to act like a goddamn adult.

""Hey honey! I made fish for dinner! I know you don't like fish, but you should just man up and eat it anyways because you're an adult. (Please, you can't buy me hotdog man.)

&gt; Ugh. That is a life not worth living

""Honey, your life is not worth living because you don't like most vegetables. It'd probably be better if you just laid down and died right now.""

&gt; I have no use for picky eaters.

""Honey, you're useless to me because you don't like the things I like.""

&gt; There may not be any hope...

""Honey, there is no hope for you.""

&gt; 1) Onion

&gt; 2) Garlic

&gt; 3) New Boyfriend

""Honey, I'm going to the store! Can you hand me my shopping list?""

I like food, and I like trying new things. And I'm sure as hell going to make him try new foods when I get the chance. But does that mean I'm going to cook him a big meal of fish and asparagus and other things he doesn't like and force him to eat it? No. This is a dude that literally has anxiety over trying new food (something I didn't mention in the /r/cooking post) and I'm not about to force something he's not going to eat on him. Especially not because a bunch of internet people told me to.

Not many things on Reddit really resonate with me, but this flier really makes me quiver with pity. I cannot imagine working for five years in pursuit of a doctorate and then having it all fall through your fingers. You can feel the sheer desperation in this plea. 

Now, it's obvious what this person *should have* done. They should've had a backup. It's plain to me, you and definitely plain to them. But am I overwhelmed by their stupidity? No, because this is a very simple and common mistake. And besides, whatever punishment this breach in protocol truly deserves, this person is getting that punishment one hundred times over.

What does Reddit have to offer? Hindsight. Nearly every post is about backups, but what really irks me are the condescending ones that claim this person is clearly not deserving of the PhD they toiled so long for:

""[This person should not have a PhD.](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1cyt71/fuck/c9lbrvu)""

[And finally](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1cyt71/fuck/c9ldb2j):
&gt;Sorry. The pre-requisite for PhD candidacy is common sense. You have wasted the last 5 years of your life because you placed too much faith in both technology and human nature. Sorry, but saving some doubt for both tech and human nature would have served you better and would not have resulted in the loss of so much tuition money and time, which you could have used to become a better fast food employee.

http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15pw0h/what_is_the_snobbiest_subreddit_you_have_ventured/

And mind you, the moderators of these featured communities were active and did a good job at nuking some of the invasion submissions. There were a couple that I wanted to feature here that were nuked by the moderators and I'm too lazy to go back through my history to find them. Generally I only was able to include the removed links that had a direct link from the askreddit thread.

The top post currently names /r/ska. 

http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15pw0h/what_is_the_snobbiest_subreddit_you_have_ventured/c7oqqp4

&gt;I found /r/ska surprisingly snobby. They get very agressive when something that isn't typical ska is posted. Punk band playing ska? ""Fuck you, I bet these guys aren't even aware of ska!""

&gt;A mention of Streetlight Manifesto causes a civil war to erupt in the subreddit.

The highest response is someone expressing disbelief that other people have different niche interests than he does:

&gt;People are snobs about fucking ska?

&gt;""This is not real ska because there isn't a guy with a fedora and checkered suspenders playing a horn in a part of the song that goes 'brrt drrrt drt drt drrrt brrrt'""

Because people being very particular and enthusiastic about their favorite music genre is just so weird, amirite askreddit? 

This mention caused a flood of /r/askredditors to show up in /r/ska. One very creative redditor showed how they can come up with really creative jokes and gags by mentioning their love for a disliked band mentioned in the askreddit thread parent. See here:

http://np.reddit.com/r/Ska/comments/15q5n4/does_anyone_else_just_love_streetlight_manifesto/

Luckily the moderators were quick to nuke the thread. The comments are basically filled with poor attempts to provoke the alleged snobbery of /r/ska:

&gt;One time I heard them and they were so ska that I ska'd all over my ska.

&gt;Ska.

Next up is /r/vegan. See here:

http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15pw0h/what_is_the_snobbiest_subreddit_you_have_ventured/c7ory5k

&gt;/r/vegan and I am a vegan. I just wanted recipes. Not a million pics of dead animals.

&gt;The last straw for me was a post about how Ellen was evil for eating eggs from chickens her friend kept.

This one is not surprising, at all. I've wanted to talk about reddit's vegan hate for a while. I care a lot about the food I eat and go to farmers markets, but I still eat meat. I meet a lot of people who also put similar efforts into what they eat including lots of vegetarian and vegans and the number of assholes is vastly overstated. Hell, I haven't met any people who attempted to shame me for eating meat, in fact I've heard far more about these vegan assholes from people bitching about vegans. 

A quick venture into /r/vegan shows the top post is a ham-fisted (sorry) trolling attempt. 

http://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/15qcze/dear_god_you_guys_are_snobs/

&gt;Please be aware, I am not anti-vegan, but I am anti-asshole, when people ask honest questions, you lash out at them, down voting them into a second hell, and calling them ""pigs"" ""murderers"" and strangely ""fascists"". This subreddit is for people interested in the vegan way of life/culture. And you are scaring them away, and creating a bad rep for yourselves.

Yes, some hypothetical judgmental vegan asshole that I read about on reddit means I can call everyone who is vegan a hipster douche asshole. And that hypothetical asshole-vegan-that-was-probably-made-up-or-at-the-very-least-is-an-exaggerated-caricature is giving you guys a bad rap and its all your fault, vegans. 

Another clumsy trolling attempt: 

http://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/15qcxo/my_friend_just_came_out_as_a_vegan_how_do_i_cope/

Third up is /r/coffee. This one had a pretty significant invasion but the moderators reacted while I was writing this post, so I missed out on a couple threads that I wanted to feature. Regardless, the askreddit comment thread starts here:

http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15pw0h/what_is_the_snobbiest_subreddit_you_have_ventured/c7opnqc

&gt;For me it was r/coffee, I got a keurig k cup machine for Christmas and was looking to ask what flavors were good, but as it turns out they hate all coffee that isn't grounded fresh with local beans right before it is made

Interesting. /r/coffee was mentioned by the OP of the whole askreddit thread. Presumably the response in /r/coffee to his question about kuerig cups is what inspired the post. I actually looked at the OP's posting history and did not see any submissions in /r/coffee. This is when I discovered that

&gt;My old post was removed because I violated the rules

http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15pw0h/what_is_the_snobbiest_subreddit_you_have_ventured/c7opowb

So there is an incredibly high chance this entire witchhunt thread was started because he was held accountable to the subreddit's rules and that made him mad. 

I did a search for keurig and came upon this thread: 

http://np.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/y58f9/kuerig_brewing_system_at_work_i_need_kcup/

People largely seem to be polite, even though they do mention they don't consider it to be high quality coffee. Frankly I don't see much rudeness or snobbery. 

Anyways, one of the highest responses includes a reference to this thread, which is now downvoted to -120 when it was the second highest posts in /r/coffee before being featured on /r/askreddit.

http://np.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/15onuh/a_journey_with_the_bayreuth_brew_method/

So yeah, someone uses some flowerly language when describing a ritual they enjoy. This is nothing unique. Humans are creatures of habit and they fucking love their rituals. You could use the exact same language except substitute coffee and a ""Bayreuth"" for weed and use some brand new vaporizer and throw it up on /r/trees and the average reddit would not bat an eye. If put on /r/askreddit, no one would give a shit and it would not be downvoted to -120

Although I disagree, let's say these redditors are right and those subreddits are filled with snobbish assholes. But that's their prerogative. Smaller subreddits should be able to maintain their unique identify and feel. Ultimately, the users of these ""snobby"" subreddits don't really seem any different from people with particular interests in, say, video games. I imagine the reaction on /r/games to someone saying they love farmville would be even worse than someone on /r/coffee saying they like shitty coffee. 

Finally, when contrasted against the complaint against SRS invasions, it gives the impression that redditors don't really care about invasions, they just see an opportunity to shit on a group of people they don't like or disagree with.

Before diving into the comments; the question itself is juvenile, even for askreddit. It's essentially a way for people to prove how cool they are by spouting some contrarian nonsense. Alright, fine; I'll leave well enough alone here. Everyone is a unique flower: that isn't so bad I guess. OP's answer is satisfactory. He answers his question, doesn't tell a story, and I think is really trying to start some productive discussions.

Maybe this thread won't be so bad! Let's look at the top comment...

&gt;I think babies that are found to have severe physical or mental disabilities while in the womb should be aborted. I'm speaking as someone who grew up around a kid with down syndrome, and while we all love him to death, he is tearing apart our family with how dependent he will be for the rest of his life.

DAE Eugenics? Eugenics gets advocated for nearly every time abortion is brought up on Reddit. We're off to a great start!

&gt;I think the whole ” support the troops” is misguided. They all voluntarily signed up and were presented a contact explicitly starting the terms. I don't not support them..nor do I support them. It's like asking me if I support taxi cab drivers. No, it's their job and they are paid to do it.

Isn't there a huge anti-war jerk on this site? I guess I just forgot that Reddit was overwhelmingly in support of the military! Silly amnesiac me! I guess I also forgot that soldiering is exactly the same as driving a taxicab, and isn't different in any important way at all.

&gt;I fucking hate kids. I'm a girl

SO BRAVE. No one on Reddit hates kids! I also love how she just throws out that she's a girl; like it's relevant. The thread she starts is actually the apex of jerking under this entire submission. There are about 4 links to /r/childfree, proof positive that this brave opinion is actually not so; and best of all we get an MRA jerk out of left field.

&gt;I like kids. I'm a guy. (Not in the pedo way)

This starts a thread of a few dozen posts about how men are discriminated against. One courageous soul describes his harrowing experience at a preschool.

&gt; I had a small experience in that particular instance. I was on my way to my field placement (I went to a preschool once a week to help out) and there were two kids with their mom in the front of the bus, and one kid in the back with his dad. The kid in the back knew me, and said hi. I waved and said hi. The dad looked up, saw me, smiled, and went back to reading his newspaper. The other two kids in the front seemed to be emboldened by this move, and also said hi. I waved to them, but instead of getting the small ignore from the parent, the mother scowled at me and steered her children's faces away from my general direction.

Those damn fundie mothers! All I want to do is aim my neckbeard childward and spread logic, reason, and joy! I feel oppressed just *thinking* about this story. I'm sure it went exactly how he described too.

&gt;I don't think people who have religious beliefs are inferior

This comment, unfortunately, is actually good! There is almost no environment other than /r/atheism where saying religious people are skytarded fundies would even be entertained; and yet our site's transcendent bravery actually makes this the norm.

One user perfectly encapsulates what's wrong with this whole submission.

&gt;This post never works. The truly controversial will get downvoted and the hivemind will rise to the top. It always happens.

Morgan Freeman's AMA has come and gone, and honestly it is what we should have expected. He's a regular old guy who's famous for acting, sitting down on the internet he rarely uses to let some fans get some questions answered, and his answers reflect his distance from the pedestal he was put on by the internet community.

This was all fine and good until [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1c693u/when_reading_the_morgan_freeman_ama/) disheartening post makes it to the top post of /r/AdviceAnimals:
&gt;Not sure if this is a PR guy

&gt;or Morgan Freeman isn't as awesome as I thought he was

Seriously? This is just ridiculous. You can plague the internet with as many Morgan Freeman imitations and image macros as you want, that won't make him a superhuman capable of satisfying Reddit's hivemind. I was annoyed upon seeing it, but it wasn't until I checked the comments section that things started really getting out of control. 

To start, there are [a](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1c693u/when_reading_the_morgan_freeman_ama/c9dfr73) [few](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1c693u/when_reading_the_morgan_freeman_ama/c9dfu1n) [comments](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1c693u/when_reading_the_morgan_freeman_ama/c9dgvp4) from Redditors (+284, +1188, and +447, respectively) desperately clinging to the hope that it wasn't their savior. This isn't nearly as bad as some of the other comments though.

My personal favorite, a mourning redditor [writes something](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1c693u/when_reading_the_morgan_freeman_ama/c9dg739) only slightly less dramatic than a Middle School Girlfriend's text message (+569):
&gt;His short answers and overuse of exclamation marks have left me completely dazed. It's like looking into the face of Zeus and seeing a lazy eye. I don't know what to believe anymore...

And possibly [even better](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1c693u/when_reading_the_morgan_freeman_ama/c9djo5z) (+12):
&gt;I feel like crying.. I feel.. dirty. I don't know. I just want to shower and fall asleep to the voice I thought I knew.

Are you fucking serious? Mr. Freeman finally does an AMA doesn't live up to the unreasonably high standards Reddit has fostered, and you don't know what to believe anymore? This is ludicrous, I honestly thought this was a joke.

Then came the ""Louis CK is so much better since he makes our jokes"" [circlejerk](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1c693u/when_reading_the_morgan_freeman_ama/#) that became the majority of comments.

Finally, someone 14 comments down has some [common sense](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1c693u/when_reading_the_morgan_freeman_ama/c9dko4y), but just has to pull the ""downvote me if you want card..."" just in case they actually get downvoted for having a contrary opinion.

All this, completely disregarding the bullshit counterjerking that clogs the +10 to +30 range, ranging from
&gt;Based on that AMA Morgan Freeman is a boring dick

to
&gt;He's an actor who gets shit faced and bangs girls while driving a sports car. He's a man's man. Everyone is confusing an character they have a hard on for and a ridiculously wealthy octogenarian playboy. You people are ridiculous.

All in all, Reddit proves again that it has no intention of learning from it's continuous stream of mistakes. Of course he isn't as awesome as you thought he was, you thought he was a minor fucking deity.

",biskino,261,41,213,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/149jop/amsterdam_is_setting_up_punishment_camps_for_scum/,"First post here and it turned into a bit of a mega-effort. Apols if this isn't cirlcebroke's kinda thing but what the hell, I'm stuck at home waiting for the boiler guy and the heat coming off r/worldnews is the next best thing to warming my hands over a fresh cat turd.

So here's an article that's bubbled to the top of my least favourite default sub jauntily titled, [Amsterdam to Create Scum Villiages] (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/14854l/amsterdam_to_create_scum_villages_nuisance/). It appears to be about a plan by the enlightened City of Amsterdam [11] to concentrate ""anti-social"" public housing tenants into ""punishment camps"" under 24 police surveillance. 

Let that soak in for a moment while I take you through the first of two massive issues I have with r/wroldnews; their complete and total inability to critically asses information.

[The article in question] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/netherlands/9719247/Amsterdam-to-create-scum-villages.html) - considered worthy of 1400 upvotes by /r/worldnews readers - is so poorly written and cobbled together that it is virtually indecipherable. How bad is it? As a reconstructed hack, let me take you on a stroll down W street.

**Who** is being moved to these new Scum Villages? Oh, you know; ""nuisance neighbours"", ""anti-social tenants"", ""the worst offenders"",  ""trash"" and ""scum"". I'm not kidding, that's as specific as it gets about the behavior of those needing to be removed. What qualifies as 'anti-social'? Who decides? There is not even a single interview with anyone directly affected by this or any sense of what the people of Amsterdam think about it. But who needs that kind of nuance when we're talking about ""scum"". Which leads me to... 

**What** is this legislation exactly? If you can find any specific policy in there, lemme know. 

**Where** are the ""scum"" being moved to? I mean there is a description of the type of housing on offer (caravans and containers) but where is it? What do those living around these new 'scum villages' have to say? 

**When?**  The tenses are so mixed up in this piece of shit that I can't even tell if this is proposed legislation or if its already in effect. 

**Why?** Always the most import question - and I love the Telegraph for just lettin' it hang like a stale fart. But not to worry, /r/worldnews - the same discerning politicos that upvoted this POS to the front page - know a dog whistle when they hear one and eagerly pick up the bone. Which takes me to the second major problem I have with this sub.

So let's take a little peek inside to see what sort of thoughtful and reflective discussion is at hand. Surely the superior intellects, learned gentlefellows and self-educated PHDs  - who always seem to come out in favour of individual rights against the tyranny of state and corporate control - will be able to shine a light for the rest of us to follow...

&gt;[Okay morons, this is a GOOD thing because it separates the assholes from the rest of society...] (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/14854l/amsterdam_to_create_scum_villages_nuisance/c7av74c)

Well that settles it for me, but if you've still got a problem with the sticky green nug at the heart of leEurope using extra-judicial procedures (including denouncement by neighbors) to move people against their will into a concentrated area where they are under 24 hour police surveillance, let me blow your mind with this counter-intuitive logic bomb... 

&gt;[The Dutch address crime in a very different way than Americans. The American system is built off revenge and punishment, while the Dutch is more based on rehabilitation and addressing the root causes of anti-social behaviour and crime itself. I'll give you one guess as to whose has worked the best.
Maybe your views would be welcome in Saudi Arabia.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/14854l/amsterdam_to_create_scum_villages_nuisance/c7awxw5)

Yea, that and only 'punishing' people who have actually been afforded due process including a trial by a jury of their peers and the opportunity to confront their accusers before being convicted of a clearly defined crime, pretty much sums up the differences between the two approaches. 

Yet despit the obvious superiority of the good old fashioned European solution to clearing scum from the streets, we have dissent! At the time of writing /r/worldnews is split (202/177) on the question of...

&gt;From a Dutch perspective I think there are two main reasons religion here is going down (except perhaps for islam):

- The pope and his backward ideas on gays, condoms etc are very contradictory to what people in the country believe. Holland was the first nation to legalize gay marriage.

- The huge scandals involving the catholic church in child abuse made a lot of people go WTF and just resign completely

- The rise of individualism means there's less place for god, if life is all about you, you are the one responsible for your successes and failures, this mythical god plays no role in it.

- O yeah, and science, which actually seems to solve people's problems in ways that prayer doesn't.

This one actually starts a small reactionary anti-engineer jerk, even though engineers aren't mentioned anywhere in the original post.

And here's the sixth-highest post (+180):

This one made me grin a little bit.

I'm not sure if this is a trend that has recently started, or just a reactionary jerk due to how pervasive the anti-liberal arts jerk is here, but I was happy to see just about all the top posts went against the typical hivemind opinion.

The top comment is relevant to playgrounds: 

&gt; when i was in pre school, we used to nail bottle caps into the side of the work table, i really cant see my daughter when she's 4 handling a hammer and nails this day and age (+25)

Followed by the even more relevant, not to say charming: 

&gt; I feel like most kids these days don't even know what the tools are called much less how to use them. One time I was in a car with three other friends my age when the car got a flat tire. Everyone started panicking, one girl was about to call 911, albiet she was a crazy bitch. Anywho then I get in their to fix it and everyone is just amazed at my ability to change a tire with the tools that came with the spare. Kids are too sheltered these days.

'How safe is too safe?' is asked again, by which the redditors mean that safe is too safe. 

&gt; There really comes a point where you have to say, how safe is too safe.
I fractured my wrist on the monkey bars when I was in Grade 2. Im not saying it made me tougher but I certainly think ahead when doing activities. As opposed to jumping in assuming everything is safe.

This comment is interesting, especially the parts I've italicised: 

&gt; I like *my* playgrounds with danger - it helps to train *kids* to be careful and to understand what pain and consequence are.

Of course it's the fault of the parents: 

&gt; Kids aren't the pussies now and days it is the parents. They are so fucking scared of everything they transfer that into their kids who end up being pussy adults. +32

Here we have an interesting - if true - contribution: 

&gt; I grew up in the countryside with huge trees/rocks, treehouses we built ourseves, slides, bikes, boats, ziplines, mopeds before i could reach the ground. Pretty much all the things that can easily kill a dumb kid. Acording to todays standards i shouldnt be alive. Just lucky i guess.

It doesn't occur to this poster that maybe part of growing up in the countryside means being taught about things like safety around farm machinery and being more familiar with natural hazards. The park in question was a city park; perhaps those kids and parents have other concerns. 

Meanwhile: 

&gt; Creating wimpy people is pretty clearly the goal of the corporate-media, it keeps wages down and makes any dissent unlikely, it makes it difficult to attract a woman that doesn't use you and then they tell you you're a virgin because you don't have a good job or a nice enough car so they get you to buy stuff and go into debt with them. I will not be putting my kids through a public school, they are now little more than factories churning out docile and inept drones.

And: 

&gt; When I was 12, I broke both bones in my forearm playing on a school playground. Rather than having it torn down or suing the school for negligence or demanding it be fixed or changed, I told my parents it happened because I was being stupid, not because something failed. My parents and I wrote a letter to the school explaining that the only person that did anything wrong was myself, and I would not want them to waste their time or money or ruin the other kids play time over it. Nowadays at that same school, kids can't even run outside lest they trip and get a booboo and wind up owning the school. It's considered roughhousing and too violent for them. They can't even play dodgeball, kickball, or baseball at recess, only in Gym, which makes all of the sense. And that playground has long since been dismantled. 

For a website that loves to spot fallacies and bias, these guys sure have trouble spotting the massive cognitive biases that come into play when we look back on our childhood. *Of course* it seems like you had loads of freedom as a kid; of course it seems like you never batted an eyelid when you broke your arm; etc, etc. That's because these are all ways in which the past can be thought of as better than today.   

I also didn't see many people with kids commenting on that thread; as far as I can tell, these are all childless adults.

If you are one of those who claim to have a so called life, and did not witness our precious and morally superior subreddit /r/circlebroke go to WhineCon 1, have no  fear, for I shall try my best to recap what has happened.


Around early morning of 1/13/13, a mod of /r/adviceanimals put up a header on the top of his subreddit. This appeared to be in response of a CB post detailing and complaining about another /r/adviceanimals post, aka another day in the Complain-o-metasphere*. This header was [this] (http://i.imgur.com/5aEHl.png), and it linked directly to CB. 


/r/circlebroke moderator klaatu_barada_nikto noticed this and quickly made CB and /r/circlebroke2 private. He then talked to AA's mods to take it off, but things hardly went [well](http://i.imgur.com/RH25E.png). Moderator klaatu_barada_nikto posted this professional meeting of higher minds on /r/subredditdrama [here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/16h8v7/i_asked_radviceanimals_to_remove_us_from_their/) (not before SRD made their own topic regarding the situation 2 hours earlier, also found [here).](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/16h2s2/rcirclebroke_has_gone_private_likely_due_to/)


Now let me set the scene at that time. Without a place to complain, unapproved CBers roamed the country side, looking for a place to settle down and start a good family of happy, atheist, STEM-loving children and their Swedish spouse. The discussion in /r/subredditdrama was very sad, as many painted these poor, poor people as foreign invaders, bullies, and Christian conservatives, when in fact, we are just SRS-lite. These people were probably blinded by light shining through their glass houses, but alas. 


Now in the period of martial law, /r/circlebroke witness a rebirth of modern culture. Cancer was cured, Faggots were not OP, and some of the best quality posts ever seen graced our front page, such as [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/16hoyv/i_heard_u_made_reddit_mad/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/16hazu/we_are_temporarily_private_because_fuck/) and especially [that](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/16haqg/dae_circlebroke/). CB intended to win at this game, and was determined to not give into the siege. They would endure these countless hours on small rations of Sagan, and only limited access to fresh Social Justice. 

Back on the outside, things were changing. /r/circlejerk decided it wanted in on the fun. After a near death experience, one of the CJ mods cames face to face with the Sagan Spirit, who tells the fateful mortal to turn their Sub private. The mods agree, and CJ is made [private](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/16h8dw/rcirclejerk_is_set_to_private_as_well/), but with a twist. The mods relay a message to their followers:
&gt;a message from the moderators of /r/circlejerk
&gt;
&gt;Sorry, we're closed!
&gt;
&gt;We will reopen, but only once someone has gotten a 'please reopen circlejerk' advice animal to the frontpage of /r/AdviceAnimals

Accepting the challenge, /r/circlejerk members quickly get many posts to or near the front page of /r/adviceanimals. An example would be [this](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/16h9j6/upvote_to_reopen_rcirclejerk_we_can_do_it_reddit/). CJ mods see that the challenge has been complete, and tell their avid followers of science to stop posting in /r/adviceanimals, and that the doors to their heaven shall reopen later that day. 


That was not all that happened however. After around 10 hours of linking to CB, /r/adviceanimals switches gears and then links to /r/braveryjerk . Braveryjerk stands tall and doesn't go private, and instead accepts the new comers with open hands, by changing their background to goatse. A brave soul from AA makes a scene there also, which you can find [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/Braveryjerk/comments/16h9k1/the_average_user_here_is_way_younger_than_in/c7w1iwb?context=1) .

After this day long battle, /r/adviceanimals turns tail and takes its forces home. The Siege of /r/circlebroke ended, and it, along with /r/circlejerk and /r/circlebroke2, are victorious.

\Serious

So what does this big clusterfuck mean? Well it means that every mod of every default suddenly realizes they are carrying Weapons of Subreddit Destruction (I felt smugly stupid typing that), and they can use them without any consequences. A small to medium subreddit can now be shitted on, and there is little to do except go private the instant it happens.



In all, I feel like one of those crazy guys on the side of the street with a sign over his naked bum saying, ""Le End is near""




**EDIT** *According to AA mod, this was not a retaliation of any CB post

http://np.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/19m18j/verizon_turns_in_baltimore_church_deacon_for/

The **TL:DR;** of the article is that a retired Deacon was turned in to authorities by Verizon for storing child pornography on their cloud servers. 

You would think this thread has the making of a big anti-Catholic Church jerk but surprisingly the comments are filled with people up in arms claiming that Verizon is in breach of privacy and warrantless scanning. They care more that a man's ""privacy was breached"" than the fact that the man had been collecting child pornography since the 1970s.

A few notable comments: 

&gt;....

&gt;[Yes, child porn is a horrible thing, but I still don't want the companies who have these servers poking through my stuff, no matter what it may be.](http://np.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/19m18j/verizon_turns_in_baltimore_church_deacon_for/)

.

&gt;[While I'm all for busting pedos, the way he was busted raises some questions about why Verizon was looking through his personal back up](http://np.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/19m18j/verizon_turns_in_baltimore_church_deacon_for/c8p91yn)

How about Verizon wanting to make sure they don't have criminals using their service? Release of liability?

&gt;[In the news next: Verizon turns in insert torrent user here for downloading copyrighted material and storing it on cloud.](http://np.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/19m18j/verizon_turns_in_baltimore_church_deacon_for/c8pf4m6)

*Opinion:* And I don't see anything wrong with that. I download a lot of music but at the same time I don't try and justify my actions with some crappy social justice logic. I'm just a cheap bastard.

There are two things that really frustrate me about this entire thread:

- The first, more obvious, is that Redditors always act like they have this ""right of privacy"" on the internet and use it as an excuse to do morally questionable things; mainly torrenting. Reddit treats Privacy Policies and End User License Agreements as dead letters that don't apply to them. A ""free and open"" internet does not mean ""$0.00 and lawless."" 

- The second, less obvious, is that Redditors *who pride themselves in their knowledge of STEM* have no clue how authorities scanned for this content. Anyone who actually knew something about IT/CS would know that a simple hash comparison script would allow for government agencies to scan files on the cloud while still providing the customer with confidentiality. *Or they could be using an API provided by a government agency that accomplishes a similar thing.*",,False,,t5_2tnz9,1362690104.0,,,True,t3_19nkvy,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/19nkvy/verizon_busts_a_pedophile_and_redditors_are_more/,
1364276447.0,212,self.circlebroke,1b0z3l,Reddit has no understanding of the arts.,zinzam72,256,44,248,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1b0z3l/reddit_has_no_understanding_of_the_arts/,"I browse here a lot and comment occasionally, but this is my first post. Maybe some other people may not agree, but to me, it feels like this is a huge trend on the default subs sometimes: a complete lack of understanding when it comes to arts.

The most prevalent one that I've noticed in the past is the anti-literature jerk, the kind of thing embodied in [this image](http://i.imgur.com/7YZXS.jpg), my least favorite thing on the internet. Posts like [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/16ejtu/every_time_i_learn_about_symbolism_in_english/) (which is a couple months old but I remember because I was particularly enraged by it) pop up every now and again.

Today, though, there was [this post](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1b0ap2/the_lightest_and_darkest_skin_colour_human/) in /r/pics, in which redditors again cannot understand some of the more subtle aspects of artistic endeavors. I don't particularly care about photography as an art form myself and I'm not going to claim this is one of the greatest pictures ever taken, but I recognize that the picture is showing a neat, very stark contrast between two people and doing it in an aesthetically interesting way.

Anyway, maybe it's the OP's fault for emphasizing the ""Lightest and Darkest Skin Color"" (which may not have even been the photographer's original intention, I don't know, but which is still a cool interpretation), but the comments are filled with people jumping up and down to prove that the two guys aren't *really* that black/white and that it was faked with makeup. For example, [this one](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1b0ap2/the_lightest_and_darkest_skin_colour_human/c92f802) (sitting at +219 right now) and [this one](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1b0ap2/the_lightest_and_darkest_skin_colour_human/c92ety4) (sitting at +406). Those are the two highest-scoring ones I saw, but there were definitely more.

However, the comment that really bugged me, and which best shows reddit's lack of artistic understanding, is [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1b0ap2/the_lightest_and_darkest_skin_colour_human/c92ezo9) sitting at +303, which is a reply to the second referenced comment above:
&gt;Yeah, dont know what the big deal is. I could paint my ass red and we can celebrate human diversity that way.

You're right; there's nothing interesting about this photograph because it was enhanced with makeup. IT'S FAKE EVERYONE, therefore we can't see anything cool in this photo and humans really aren't that different, it's totally useless. The guy can't see beyond the surface level of ""it's not really like that"" to understand the picture still has an interesting symbolism.

EDIT: I decided to come back and add these two comments in quickly, because these definitely have any artistic symbolism go right over their heads (DAE woosh?). They're both only at +3, but I feel like the sentiments they express are evident throughout the thread.
&gt;[This isn't diversity, it's just skin color.](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1b0ap2/the_lightest_and_darkest_skin_colour_human/c92i422)

Redditors can't seem to understand that sometimes things *can* be gleaned from art, and this is just one example of that. There are also plenty of other jerks going on the comments there too, but this one seemed the most interesting to me. (Although now that I finished writing this, I'm kinda thinking that maybe this wasn't that really a jerk at all - there *were* some [higher top comments](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1b0ap2/the_lightest_and_darkest_skin_colour_human/c92egnk) which were praising other photographs for their artistic merits.

[The thread.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/19sawk/mother_teresa_humanitarian_image_a_myth_new_study/).  It sits +638 in World News.  Let's first examine the article itself:

&gt;The Times of India, reporting on the controversial essay, wrote that the authors asserted...

That's right.  The Huffington Post is paraphrasing a The Times of India report about the essay.  Because we can't wait until the study is actually released!  There wouldn't be enough mystery for speculation, hyperbole and misdirection.  Well, let's click through HuffPo to a [summary of the study](http://www.nouvelles.umontreal.ca/udem-news/news/20130301-mother-teresa-anything-but-a-saint.html), hosted on the researchers' University website.  The main problems cited?

&gt;her rather dubious way of caring for the sick, her questionable political contacts, her suspicious management of the enormous sums of money she received, and her overly dogmatic views regarding, in particular, *abortion, contraception, and divorce.* [emphasis mine]

Umm... Mother Teresa's views on those subjects line up 100% with Catholic doctrine.  Sorry she was Catholic.  But what about the other criticisms?  It's important to keep in mind that Mother Teresa's mission was hospice care.  As in, care for the dying.  Let's check out what they have to say about that:

&gt;The missions have been described as ""homes for the dying"" by doctors visiting several of these establishments in Calcutta.

Is that supposed to be an indictment?  The name of her mission is literally *Home for the Dying*.

Ok, ok.  Enough with the summary of the study that the HuffPo ""reported"" on.  It's not like anyone bothered to read it anyway.  Let's check the comments, which fall into one of three main categories:

*1. ""Hitchen is way ahead of you, idiot""

There's a lot more jerking beyond the top comments.  It all stems from one of two sources: the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa#Criticism) which gives questionable citations for some of their claims, and Hitchen's book/documentary.  Unfortunately, most people are taking each others' word for it instead of actually reading/watching.  It's incredibly frustrating to go from [this interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WQ0i3nCx60#t=5m35s) with an actual volunteer, which certainly brings up questionable practices, to this:

&gt;[You can't be the administrator of a hospice care facility and have the ethos ""Let them die as painfully as possible without seeking real medical treatment and refuse to ease their suffering no matter the circumstances.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/19sawk/mother_teresa_humanitarian_image_a_myth_new_study/c8r4ta7)

Sorry, thanks for listening to my rant.  It's just enormously frustrating to see an thread in which there was basically no visible acknowledgment that Mother Teresa had done any good in her life.  And, while there is certainly merit to questioning her beatification, the jump from ""she was not a saint"" to ""she was a terrible and evil person"" seems to be built on a lot of willful misdirection and ignorance.

I'm not gonna lie, the little proto-MFAer is totes adorbz standing their in his slim fit khaki's in front of his math club medals. I just want to pinch his cheek and give him a Werthers Original.

Now MFA's reaction was a little different than mine. Full disclosure here, there were several guys on MFA who were great. They treated the kid with some respect, spoke to him plainly and without being condescending and gave some actual good advice and tips. Unfortunately, as hard as the minority of thoughtful and informed posters try, MFA is still on Reddit, and the only thing that makes Reddit more uncomfortable than the presence of women, it is the presence of children. This causes a pretty spectacular perfect storm of Redditry as several circlejerks converge into one massive category 5 circlejerk storm of awkwardness.

**The first of these circlejerks is a familiar one if you've ever previously been to MFA. It's the suggestion that you will never look good in clothing ever unless you are thin and sufficiently worked out. Now mind you, this is advice being given to a 13 year old.**

Yes, workout, *13 year old*, so you can get laid. Good advice for *a 13 year old*. Because I'm sure that a small 13 year old that is bullied and called gay doesn't have *any* body issues or hang-ups at all. Nope. Good advice.

My mistake.

&gt;""Do you even lift? Nah but look into lifting. At that age it's easy to get into the habit and I promise you'll be happy you did it.""

I'm just joking, but I'm not really joking. Lift little bro, lift like the wind.

How dare you not be buff *at fucking 13!!!*

&gt;""OP, unrelated to your question completely, some guys on here have mentioned it but it can't be stressed enough, start looking into lifting now. It takes maybe a couple years to become gain your basic knowledge but the rewards are tremendous. It's fun, it's helps you in every other aspect of your life, and it puts hair on your ass! (i.e. makes you more of a man). You came here looking for clothing advice and your body is the outfit you'll be wearing all the time. I just wish someone had told me at 13, do it right and high school, as well as the rest of your life, will be soo much better for ya.""

No, you're trying to hate. On a 13 year old. You must feel really good about yourself.

&gt;""Hi. So I am going to sound like a huge ass and will get downvotes to hell, but I just want you to see this. I am in highschool right now. 13 could be middle school IDK. And I am going to be real here, a lot of people are going to think your parents make you dress like that, or that you are a douchey little kid. I wouldn't, but guess what? 13 year olds are fucktards most of the time. If you don't care, good on you, and thank you for trying to look better. If you are a the type who cares a lot about what the other kids say, I'd say dress 'normally'.""

Yeah, why would a 13 year old go on the internet? Shouldn't he be finger-painting or some shit??

&gt;""You look like your parents dress you.
&gt;You're 13. What are you dressing up for?""

Yeah, you should be wearing Garanimals and light-up Spider-man shoes!


&gt;""Just wait for puberty man. for now just keep wearing ben 10 and power ranger clothes""

I swear I wrote the Garanimals thing before I found that comment.

So, serious[le]y, brave.

&gt;""I was your age only a couple of years ago buddy... And to be honest, thins post seems more like an attempt to flaunt your maturity than anything else.

&gt;""Aww I had forgotten about Neopets.""

No you didn't.

&gt;""nigga you need some light up shoes

&gt;""Okay, first off let me say that, yes, that's a good outfit (personally I hate sperries but that's just cause of the people I associate with them, not even a general group, just very specific people and there's a lot of them.

This is male fashion advice, most of which pertains to when you're off at college, not in middle school. As if it even matters in middle school, or high school for that matter. I spent a year in button downs, nice jeans or khakis, nice shoes, and even vests some days. And I spent the next year in gym shorts and tshirts. NO ONE GAVE A FUCK. Sure it's nice to know how to dress and people will respect you for it, but the respect is so minimal it just doesn't matter. Girls will want you if you're hot, or even if you're not long as you know how to talk to them. How do you think that fat, ugly, center lineman on the football team gets girls? Not by his looks, clothes, or even his status as a football player. Anyway, worry about other things right now, kid. Like preparing for acne (even if you have some now, just wait, it doesn't really start til you're 15) or anything else really. Besides, do kids even do anything at 13? I only remember going to movies to try my david coppafeel routine. Anyway, you're off to a good start but this isn't anything you have to worry about... At all... That said, get a new haircut. Short and gelled up (actually, I just use water, works just fine) at the front. It looks good, timeless, impossibly easy to manage, you always know when it's too long, and it doesn't make your head look weird (not that yours does, but when I had longer hair it always did that shit in the back and was just FAR too much effort for a haircut that looked okay at best).""

Here we go again.

You spy a little post on the front page, a WTF post, titled 'Meet Britain's youngest grandparents'. It is of course, a slight eye-opener. The parents of the newborn child look frighteningly young. But the family look happy, and relatively secure.

700 comments, you notice. You wonder what the good people of Reddit will have to say about the topic.

I'll give you three fucking guesses.

[""The movie 'Idiocracy' is so hauntingly true-to-life, it's fucking scary.""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1blbwa/meet_britains_youngest_grandparents/c97r0b2) Without a shred of irony, the 'Idiocracy' circlejerk is off. And as much as I dislike the overuse of the word 'circlejerk', it's the only word for the Idiocracy discussions, isn't it? It's a collection of people reinforcing each other's beliefs that they're the smartest people in the world, and that everyone else is genetically inferior.

[""shit like this is why i'm beginning to support eugenics and forced sterilisation on a massive global scale there are so many people who should never be allowed to procreate (and I include myself in this), but those arseholes always seem to have a whole skip full of wailing little fuckers.""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1blbwa/meet_britains_youngest_grandparents/c97pp6v)

But the 'I'm so smart, I watched a broad comedy starring Luke Wilson' jerk isn't the worst thing in the thread. True to form, the website that gave all that money to that bus driver because she got bullied show their warmth and compassion yet again.

1. [""they all look like they have Down's""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1blbwa/meet_britains_youngest_grandparents/c97prau) - leading to 'lol that's just chavs!'

2. [""Do they all have downs?""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1blbwa/meet_britains_youngest_grandparents/c97p5rr) - leading to more assumptions that they must have fetal alcohol syndrome, and genuinely fucking enragingly, the ignorant, hate-filled CUNT of a comment: [""They're benefit scrounging chavs, they all look like that/""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1blbwa/meet_britains_youngest_grandparents/c97qapi). Sorry for saying cunt and that, but... well, more on why this bullshit makes me so fucking angry in a minute.

3. [Pretty open homophobic mocking of the father.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1blbwa/meet_britains_youngest_grandparents/c97pk0t) Followed by somebody calling the wife ugly.

4. [""No way that bitch is 29.""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1blbwa/meet_britains_youngest_grandparents/c97q676) says 'Timlad'. What a wonderful human being.

5. [More of the wonderful hypocrisy where Reddit, the biggest critics of expectations of men, insult other people for not being masculine enough.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1blbwa/meet_britains_youngest_grandparents/c97r0sw) ""I still can't believe that this guy got laid"", says some guy with a fucking shit username. But he has. And you're the one sitting online putting him down. I wonder who wins there.

What number am I on? Don't care, I've only got one link left. [""Are they all that ugly over there?""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1blbwa/meet_britains_youngest_grandparents/c97p13l) Not so bad, compared to the others. But it's the responses I'm looking at:

[""Not ALL, but the ones who get themselves in these situations tend to be the lower ranked individuals...""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1blbwa/meet_britains_youngest_grandparents/c97peli)

[""No, just poor people.""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1blbwa/meet_britains_youngest_grandparents/c97qb7q)

You know... at a time when the richest in our country are removing piece-by-piece the support that the poorest need, it's nice to know that we can all be counted on to stick together, and to not buy into hatemongering Daily Mail bullshit about how the lower classes are all lazy, benefit-scrounging scum who only have babies to get bigger houses.

1370800148.0,214,self.circlebroke,1fzow0,Why Reddit's STEM jerk is laughably inaccurate (and why STEM students aren't scientists).,snallygaster,312,98,261,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1fzow0/why_reddits_stem_jerk_is_laughably_inaccurate_and/,"As all of you probably know, Reddit has the collective idea that STEM majors are inherently more valuable, with better job placements and more use to society. For a very extreme example of this sentiment, take a look at [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1fuzah/its_an_antiintellectual_moment_according_to/) recent thread, in which humanities students are considered to be useless navel-gazers in comparison to the clearly *superior* people studying math and physics. Here's [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/medqw/grade_inflation_might_be_the_reason_kids_choose/) thread just to meet the guidelines, tee hee.

Outside of some lucrative STEM majors, most recent STEM grads looking for employment know that this is very, very, very inaccurate. 

In all honesty, people with bachelor's degrees in science don't know shit about their respective fields aside from the basics. Bachelor's courses generally don't keep students updated in current research in the fields and (for the most part) don't teach students much more than basic research methods. Frankly, you are not a scientist just because you have a BSc in Physics. You are simply somebody with a degree in Physics. One look at employment rates and entry-level jobs for STEM students can confirm this, and highlight why the STEM jerk is so laughably unfounded.

A scientist is somebody who contributes to the pool of scientific knowledge by conducting research and publishing papers. STEM grads do not (usually) do this, and as such they are not scientists. Due to this, they are not inherently more useful to society than humanities majors, by Reddit's standards. 

Let's take a look at [unemployment rate by major](http://www.studentsreview.com/unemployment_by_major.php3) (**edit**: very bad stats, see bottom edit). What's that? Some of the highest unemployment rates belong to engineers? What, huh? *Physics* majors have a higher unemployment rate than communications majors? What is this? Aren't all STEM majors supposed to have exponentially higher employment prospects than humanities majors? Aren't they more valuable? *Archaeologists* have a 0% unemployment rate!? Don't they just dig up pottery and shit!?

The sad fact of the matter is that you can't really do shit in your field with a BSc in most STEM disciplines. There is essentially no use for somebody with a bachelor's degree level of knowledge in science. If you have a BSc in Chemistry, the only way you'll be able to contribute to scientific progress is by cleaning beakers, for the most part. Well, those with a bachelor's in Chemistry are actually quite useful in industry, but it's doubtful that Quality Control is one of the jobs lauded as superior by those wanking over STEM fields. The fact of the matter is that [over half of recent STEM graduates can't find jobs in their fields](http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2013-05-24/news/bs-ed-stem-20130524_1_stem-jobs-math-workers).  Yes, my cheeto-encrusted pals, that means that most STEM graduates get to look forward to hunching over in cubicles next to those *inferior* philosophy grads they seem to loathe. 

Because most Redditors are spry, idealistic young things, they seem to think that, in entering a STEM degree, they'll be contributing great things to society. Unfortunately, the reality is that, for the most part, a bachelor's degree isn't meant to prepare one to enter a scientific field. A bachelor's degree is meant to give somebody the *tools* to move forward to higher education, or to prepare them to enter the workforce. The only advantage that comes from most STEM degrees is the impression that a STEM degree is more difficult than a humanities degree. This may give STEM graduates a slight advantage over humanities graduates, but they are still competing for the same jobs for the most part. A physics major generally makes no greater contribution to society than a philosophy major, especially by Reddit's standards, as they are not involved in any form of scientific innovation. They work the same desk jobs as humanities majors.

And you know what? That's totally okay. As it stands, there are [already more scientists with advanced degrees than the market can handle](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=does-the-us-produce-too-m). Why would America need a bunch of STEM BScs in scientific fields when actual *scientists* with PhDs can't find work? It's a bit silly for Redditors to bemoan lack of funding in STEM fields and cry for an increase in science education when there's already too many scientists already.

If most STEM majors end up working the same jobs as humanities majors, why are they so lauded by Redditors? What makes them more superior if they have nothing more to contribute to society than anybody else with a degree? Are Redditors trying to justify the fact that they're working hard on their precious ~math problems~ to the same outcome as somebody getting laid? Do they want to feel superior to people who talk about *feelings* and *subjectivity*? Are they delusional enough to think that they're inherently contributing more to society just by possessing a BSc? Are they simply ignorant to the fact that they too will most likely be cubicle-dwellers? Dunno, lol.

I won't be making friends in this rant.   

[In this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ymqrc/til_that_helen_keller_was_a_radical_socialist_and/), we learn that Helen Keller was a socialist.  Big fucking deal?  Oh wait, reddit has a strange hard-on for socialism &amp; communism.  Just seeing the title made me cringe, because I know what's coming.  

The debate about socialism comes after the OP appeals to authority about [how many famous people are socialists](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ymqrc/til_that_helen_keller_was_a_radical_socialist_and/c5x22mb).  Wow, amazing!  Other famous people are scientologists, I bet that's great too!

Want actual responses that don't make shit up or dodge the question?  Sorry friend, you'll have to move along.  Here we go:

[It's a stupid loaded question that I'll choose not to answer only because the question is stupid](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ymqrc/til_that_helen_keller_was_a_radical_socialist_and/c5x2mfc).

[Norway](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ymqrc/til_that_helen_keller_was_a_radical_socialist_and/c5x30j7).  That's right, his example is *of a capitalist country with state ownership of some industries*.  Love it.  [Commenter](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ymqrc/til_that_helen_keller_was_a_radical_socialist_and/c5x39q8) points out that Norway isn't socialist [-3 for a factually true comment], and the [rebuttal](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ymqrc/til_that_helen_keller_was_a_radical_socialist_and/c5x3h0c) minces words, commits a fallacy of false continuum, and ignores socialism's *actual* 100 year track record.  Upvoted.

OP's response: [Well, what is ""success"" anyway? That's so, like, vague man...](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ymqrc/til_that_helen_keller_was_a_radical_socialist_and/c5x2r7y).  (Didn't know a high standard of living was so difficult to define.)

And, my friends, here is the cream of the crop: the [long-winded historical revisionism](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ymqrc/til_that_helen_keller_was_a_radical_socialist_and/c5x3ybn) that graces every attempt at discussion about socialism.  *(voice of Stefan)* This post has everything: socialism has never been tried, early socialism didn't work because it turned into too much state power (but next time will be different!), you fundies don't know what socialism even means, it *has* worked ""all the time, everywhere"":

&gt;And that actually is something that works well all the time, everywhere: all corporations are internally run in a highly socialist manner. More and more worker-owned businesses are popping up all the time, thousands and thousands in the last decade. Additionally, there have even been stateless socialist ""states"" about which history has been written (basically short-lived communes that were drowned in their own blood like Paris in 1882, parts of Germany and Italy after WWI, etc), the most well-known probably being the anarchist controlled parts of Spain during the Spanish Civil War, which were eventually destroyed by fascist and Soviet-supported armies. But you can read all about it in George Orwell's *Homage to Catalonia!*

(check it out in a socialist's book, it's true!), and it only doesn't work when you don't believe (like Peter Pan!), you just don't understand, pretending socialism had something to do with a 40-hour workweek and other benefits (lol), and last but not least, *an italicized warning that ""there isn't going to be a future for humans on the Earth""* unless we turn to glorious socialism and will economic dreams into reality! (That's how it works, right?)  Then, as a sign off, a nice ""fuck you"".  Upvoted +3

It's pathetic.  Redditors pick theories and portions of history that suit their ideology, and shun anything that doesn't jibe with their reality.  Nevermind that economic science moved past socialism 50 years ago and states that actually attempted socialism ended up either destroying themselves or lagging severely behind other states with free markets.  I want to believe that we can will our way to utopia, and fuck you for telling me it doesn't work.  I love science, but fuck economic science!  

Thanks for listening to my rant, and again, sorry to the actual socialists who patronize /r/circlebroke.  This may not be the thread for you.  

**EDIT: It appears that the balance of upvotes/downvotes in that thread has been significantly shifted.  Remember, CB is not a voting brigade.  It is very important for this subreddit to not become one.**  Thanks for reading!  Loved the discussion.

Now let's get into some standard AMA-style ""YOU DIDN'T ANSWER GOOD ENOUGH"" whining.  In response to a reply to a question about dick size:

&gt;[that was a political answer, you completely avoided the question](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12j49k/hi_im_a_porn_star_my_name_is_sarah_shevon/c6viloa)

God forbid she not feel like disclosing this information, I mean this isn't some powderpuff Today Show interview, this is /r/IAmA!  Clearly she's obligated to answer these hard-hitting questions to the fullest extent.

Really though, that's a general IAmA trend that bugs me.  Someone decides to take a couple of hours out of their day to satisfy the interest of a bunch of smug neckbeards on the internet, and is only met with a chorus of ""WAA THIS SUX"".  A person doing an AMA on reddit is like being a guest in the reddit household, and reddit generally treats their guests like shit.  So what sets this AMA apart?

OP admits to losing her virginity at 13. Response?

Yup, speaking of the OP in 3rd person *in a direct reply to the OP*.

Next, OP is asked about plans after she finishes her porn career and she gives a vague sort of 'we'll see' type answer.  A redditor's response:

WHO RAISED THESE SHITHEADS?  Pardon me for a moment, I realize you should never be shocked to find impoliteness on the internet, but the idea that someone thinks it's acceptable to tell a person that they're a whore, much less someone taking time to answer your questions just really pisses me off.  And if that wasn't bad enough, you can sense a disturbing type of glee in the idea that this woman is going to be useless and washed up after she's done with porn.  Why do redditors hate the idea of a woman making her livelihood in porn?  I mean they certainly love watching it and masturbating to it and talking about how they masturbated to it with all their dudebros on reddit.

Eventually the OP mentions that she's growing tired of all the jerks in that thread.  The post is now deleted, but in reply:

",ProveItToMe,252,45,319,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/12axd1/reddit_declares_that_the_mother_of_a_12_year_old/,"First time posting, the comments on this /r/funny just made me...incredulous. I'm trying to be angry, but I keep thinking it's some kind of joke I'm not getting. 

[Link to the offending comment thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/128yh5/we_need_more_parents_like_this_fb/)

For the lazy, the picture is a screenshot of facebook. Not too original, okay, but this is reddit. In the screenshot, a mother uses her daughter's facebook account to tell all her friends that 

A. Her daughter is 12 years old, in seventh grade, and in middle school. She'd been claiming to be older for various reasons.

B. She was caught sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night with a boy, which is the inciting incident for the post.

C. Several boys/men have been asking her for naked pictures (it's unclear whether she gave them out or not.) The mother warned not to ask again or contact, and said that she'd given the conversations and contact information to the police, presumably so they could sort out who had and hadn't known the daughter was 12, and make arrests accordingly. 

D. She isn't allowed back on Facebook, and heaven help anyone who tried to assist her getting back on.

This, to me, seems like a reasonable response. The mother was obviously not calm, and could probably have used a little more punctuation, but overall the message was clear: my daughter fucked up, and she is underage, so watch it, you creepy ""friends"" of hers.

So, let's just check the comments and see how Reddit reacted to...

Oh.

&gt;""...they were caught. That will NOT happen again""
Yep, after this embarrasing incident, the daughter will be much more sneaky in future.
&gt;
&gt;With a nuclear response like this I fully expect this girl had several more ""incidents"" to come. Maybe I'm left out on a history of shitty behavior in response to reasonable parenting but this kind of absolute ""NO DATING MY DAUGHTER IS PURE MAGICAL UNICORN VIRGIN"" is bullcrap.
&gt;
&gt;Yeah, way to go, shame your daughter for experimenting with sexuality rather than rationally explaining the dangers, and make her the butt of every single joke from every single person for the next few years.
&gt;
&gt;Being absurdly strict and socially alienating your child is only going to lead to ongoing issues (depression, rebellion, social anxiety). ...I mean if the girl is only 12 years old now, the mother will ideally want to keep her home another 6 years and nobody can live in that situation for 6 years straight.

Yeah, of course, any attempt to help a child is doomed to failure and ultimately meaningless. We may as well just let them roam wild through the streets, fucking each other and doing drugs, and not even make the effort.

Let me just reiterate here: this girl is *twelve*. She's not some High School-er whose mother doesn't want to admit she has a vagina. She's *twelve goddamn years old.* 

&gt;This is a horrible parent overreacting to a normal tween who's experiencing puberty and hormones for the first time. 200 years ago this girl would already be married and it wouldn't be an issue.

...What? That's...what? I don't even know where that comment came from. Jesus.

And then, of course, there's the people who think the mother went too far giving the names to the police. (Her exact words were, ""For those boys asking for pictures of her undressed I am making a list and will turn it over to the Sherrifs Office for them to investigate and charge as they deem fit."") I mean, if you're on Facebook trying to get pictures from a supposedly teenage/adult girl, you're already looking a little shifty, so that makes sense. And she's not even threatening too much, just saying that those who the police believe were out of line will be charged according to the law. That makes sense. Right? Right, guys?

&gt;Keep in mind, some of these boys she lead on may have been relatively young but still subject to getting RUINED by the law over a small enough age gap. Some of them have been lied to but could end up permanently recorded as sex offenders.
&gt;
&gt;So the mum's calling peado on all the guys who tried to fuck her, because she lied about her age? Yeah, that's probably fair
&gt;
&gt;I actually totally disagree with the mothers pov. If she knows that her daughter has been lying about her age then she shouldn't be turning in the names of the people who have been talking to her. I think that the punishments to the daughter are fair but I don't think it's fair to try and ruin these kids lives because your daughter is a lying whore at the age of 12.

Of course, there were some dissenting opinions to rescue me from the insanity:

&gt;All the convos are saved she said. If/when the police are involved they'll have access to them, and be able to see which ones she lied to and which ones she didn't. It's the people that weren't lied to that should be worried.
&gt;
&gt;Pretty sure the threats were levelled at boys who asked for naked pictures, not boys who just wanted to hang out and date her.
&gt;
&gt;""Please, stop with the demonizing sexuality""
&gt;Trying to prevent a barely pubescent girl from sending naked photos to older men is demonizing sexuality?

Finally, let's end with this comment addressing the earlier ""200 years ago"" comment. Instead of quoting it in its entirety, [I'm just gonna link it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/128yh5/we_need_more_parents_like_this_fb/c6tbqh9)

When in the course of Circlebroke™ events it becomes necessary for ~~one people~~ mods to enforce the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of this subreddit, the separate and unequal station to which the laws of Redditquette and of nature of their beards entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of users requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. So to make a long story short ... do not downvote per disagreement. I would like to use [the following comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/11rlrb/tom_hanks_accidently_says_the_word_fuck_on_good/c6ozcqb) as an example of this. At the time it was made it received heavy downvotes. It was only after it was pointed out that it crept back into the positives. Let's be realistic, we will never eliminate this entirely, but we will strive to point it out when we see trends going in that direction, and that's what we have been seeing lately. So once again here is your reminder: Do not downvote per disagreement. If you disagree with someone please either flip off your monitor, or leave a civil comment as to why you disagree. And the report button isn't a mega-downvote button. It just alert's us to possible sidebar violations, so please use it to report something you feel violates either Reddit's ToS, or Circlebroke's sidebar rules. 

Circlebroke is inevitably going to complain about things that you like from time to time, and you're just going to have to deal with that.

**""Circlebroke is just a giant circlejerk""**

Yes we know. We've clearly stated that in both our sidebar, and the cartoon at the bottom. All this subreddit started out as was a way for people from /r/circlejerk to break character and bitch about dumb shit on Reddit. If you're genuinely curious about the origins of /r/circlebroke then [see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/qf9s6/it_has_been_fun_everyone_but_its_over_well_just/c3x8ylh). That's it, man. No one is saying they're better than anyone else, no one is denying that what they're complaining about may be an exaggeration. It's a subreddit meant for bitching, not the last bastion of philosophical debate on Reddit, and as such shouldn't be put up on a pedestal of how great it was or could be if we would just do things the way people bitched about it. Haqua sums it up nicely [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/10ojn3/time_to_do_some_introspection_a_comment_from/c6fasej).

Circlebroke isn't here to save you! It's here to make fun of you because it's bored!

**""There's no real circlejerk here""**

This is one that has been getting thrown around more and more. Of course posts pointing out circlejerks around Reddit are, and always will be, welcome, they are not necessarily mandatory. We are the Complainpire (or as some of you like to say, The Whinocracy), therefore submissions containing straight up complaining are welcome, and encouraged. Circlebroke's [first heavily upvoted submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/uakzb/i_find_myself_rooting_against_reddit_in_all/) was nothing more than a general complaint thread. 

**DAE think CB SRS LITE?**

No we are not some proxy arm of the Fempire. They have their complaints, and we have ours, and sometimes those complaints overlap. Issues of racism, misogyny, and sexism are welcome in /r/circlebroke as long as they adhere to our guidelines. Would SRS welcome these posts as well? I'm sure they would. Anyone with any complaint is welcome to post here. To borrow a phrase from Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, ""There is no user bigotry here. We do not look down on SRS, out of character novelty accounts, power users, or Karmanaut. Here you are all equally worthless.""

**It's getting stuffy in here**

Relax. Circlebroke is a place to complain about stupid shit on Reddit as WELL as having fun doing it. As stated before we are not the last bastion of philosophical debate on Reddit. That also doesn't mean shitting up the comment section  with reaction gifs, and ""so brave"" either. Remember rule three in the Circlebroke FAQ ""What makes a good CB post? A provocative, engaging, ENTERTAININGLY vitriolic (and sometimes even useful) discussion about reddit with a unique, descriptive title.""

**Now hiring**

As you may have noticed we have lost a few mods, and gained some new ones. ytknows has gone to the great circlejerk in the sky, aco620 has stepped down from /r/circlebroke (no there is no juicy drama behind that), and willmcdougal has moved on to greener pastures. We'd like to thank them for their contributions to /r/circlebroke over the last seven months. We've also added four new moderators ...

* kitchendancer - former runner up on The Price is Right, and winner of her 2nd grade Safety Town award. 

* CircleJerkAmbassador - Hustler Humor illustrator, and owner of the world's 5th largest Swatch collection. 

* twentyone_21 - world traveler, poet, shepherd, and mandolin virtuoso. 

* lolsail - once listened to Pink Floyd's The Wall backwards while on five hits of acid, and literally saw God. 

Now we are looking at adding two more. So if you would like to join the CB mod team please post in the comment section. Include subreddits you moderate (if any), your timezone, how long you've been subscibed to CB and the usual shenanigans about why you want to come on board. 

**Survey time**

It's been a while since our last survey, so we feel it's time do another. Some questions are serious, others not so much, and some are just general CB silliness. So if you have five minutes we would appreciate your time.

[**Take the survey**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDU5azlLc2p6Y0k0bE5xcklRcnVtZHc6MQ#gid=0), and allow us to dissect you with our blunt, little tool.

1364483833.0,206,self.circlebroke,1b6if3,Fuck EA and SimCity! Let's boycott them! Here's Battlefield 4!,Cyril_Clunge,270,64,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1b6if3/fuck_ea_and_simcity_lets_boycott_them_heres/,"Okay this isn't really about a circlejerk so please forgive me. The title was inspired [by this this /r/circlejerk post](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/1b42pu/fuck_ea_and_simcity_im_never_buying_another_game/), no I'm complaining about that thread but it made me curious.

What is reddit's reaction to Battlefield 4?

SimCity caused so much drama that a lot of people said things along the lines of ""don't buy another EA game. Simple. Show them the consumer has the power"". It would've been interesting to see people follow through with this.

So I put on a Hazmat suit, said goodbye to my wife and kids and ventured into /r/gaming to see what was going on.

First up is [this post which complains about the colour of BF4](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1b4n93/best_part_on_battlefield_4/).

There is only one [comment here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1b4n93/best_part_on_battlefield_4/c93ocka) that mentions the EA boycott that everyone seemed so willing to do. In that thread one person says that DICE (who are making the BF games) promised things for BF3 that weren't included in the game. Which is what happened in SimCity (although at least BF3 was a lot more playable and not broken the same way SC was).

There's [this self-post](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1b3oxk/yay_ea_is_making_battlefield_4_no_way_lets_all/) which calls everyone out on it but OP seems to be alone.

&gt; Edit: Judging by the comments my opinion isn't popular. I just don't understand why we can't all miss out on one video game to try and do something worthwhile for once. The gaming industry is dying and it's not the corporations fault at this point. It's ours, we let them get away with their sleazy business practices. Almost every few months people rally up against EA over their antics. Afterwards they announce a new big game or try and make up for their bullshit and everybody forgets about taking action. It happens every single time. Apparently, it's time for complacency once again; this time for a shitty repetitive series. It's almost as if marketing is suffocating our ability to act like dignified human beings, who won't stand up to being pushed around.

Fortunately one guy did more research than I can be bothered to do

&gt; Okay, so I've only looked at about 60 of you who are against what OP is saying. I looked through your comment history. Nearly every single one of you jumped on the EA hate wagon - most of you several times - concerning various games in the past. More than several of you stated that you would love to boycott them.

And then in another post there is [this top comment](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1b3faz/battlefield_4_17_minutes_of_gameplay/c93aizc) which says

&gt; FUCK EA - I'M NEVER GOING TO BUY A GAME FROM THAT FUCKING COMPANY AGAIN AFTER THE SHIT THEY PULLED WITH SIMCITY!!!! BOOOOOOOOOYYYYCOOOOOOOOTTTT!!!!
.. .. ..

&gt;Two weeks later:
Ooooh look! Battlefield 4!

-------------------------------

**My opinion:**

Seriously? That's how low Reddit will fall? When someone comes over here, and sees the frontpage riddled with adviceanimals, atheists bashing over muslims, memes which were funny the first 1000 times they were posted, stuff ""considered old by even ebaumsworld in 2007"" (*quote by ForeverPandering on YouTube*), what would they think? How do you explain to them that that is not who we really are when it looks like we are? 

I expect admins to do something, quickly. This is not a polite debate about atheism and islam, not a debate about religion, not a discussion, not even a damn *flame war*, this is hate speech, prohibited by Reddiquette and all possible internet etiquettes, everywhere on the internet (except maybe 4chan's /b/ and similar boards), and the admins are sitting there probably saying ""haha let's do nothing about it""?! **For fucks sake, people are invading other people's freedoms even inside their own fucking subreddit?!** I'm surprised none of these were banned or deleted by /r/islam mods because, even as an atheist, I would do that.

These guys are sending a wrong image about reddit to the public. I believe that, for the good of all of us, /r/atheism should either be kicked out from default subreddits or even be banned for all eternities for invading other subreddits, exploiting their popularity and being massive jerks. *I don't give a fuck if it means ""oppressing someone's freedoms"" - these guys are prime example of oppression*. I don't care if they jerk around in their own subreddit, but when it spills over to another subreddits, that's where I draw the line.

Working quickly, Reddit was able to push out all the information needed in the top three posts:

✓ Mainstream media is corrupt.

✓ America sucks.

✓ Massive government and media conspiracy.

_____________

Diagnosis: Mainstream media calls the bombing a terrorist attack.

Solution: Pick a fringe opinion and roll with it.

&gt;[...Ji, who was protesting a beating by local government officers in 2005 that left him paralyzed and in a wheelchair, is being hailed as a hero by many Chinese...](http://qz.com/106590/this-paralyzed-taxi-driver-set-off-a-bomb-in-the-beijing-airport-to-protest-injustice-and-it-worked/)

Mainstream media is always lame and corrupt, so why not link to the fringe opinions and claim it as the popular one.

&gt;[It's sad when a large group of constituents hate the government so much they are happy about an airport bombing.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1it0jf/footage_of_a_wheelchair_bound_protester_blowing/cb7rn09)

Clearly so many people in China felt so strongly that they all banded together to blow this one guy up. Now imagine if you took one of the Boston Bombing threads and posted something like this in there.

&gt;[It brings a great amount of awareness to the world because it's done at an international spot of travel and tourism.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1it0jf/footage_of_a_wheelchair_bound_protester_blowing/cb7u3i2)

He's just trying to raise awareness, guys. Some people make commercials, some people sign a petition, and some people decide to attempt a suicide bombing at a busy airport.

&gt;[Terrorisms goal is to incite terror and fear into people and have those people change out of fear. Not condoning an airport bombing, but if the populous is cheering him as opposed acting out of fear, its not exactly terrrorism as it lacks the Terror aspect.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1it0jf/footage_of_a_wheelchair_bound_protester_blowing/cb7uqhi)

If they agree with it, it isn't terrorism, right? So Al Qaeda is cool guys, a bunch of people agree with them, so they're just protesting.

_________________

Diagnosis: Lack of America in this thread.

Solution: Criticize America.

&gt;[If this happened in America, wheelchairs would be outlawed on planes, all disabled people would be subjected to harassment, and the country where the wheelchair was manufactured would be invaded.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1it0jf/footage_of_a_wheelchair_bound_protester_blowing/cb7s9i7)

The second highest voted post in the thread because where would we be without applying the situation to an America hypothetical.

_________________________________

Diagnosis: The Chinese government is literally ~~Hitler~~ Mao.

Solution: Believe in a conspiracy theory with no evidence.

&gt;[So a bit more info for ya guys. The guy survived. The rest of them were not injured cos the bomber used homemade bomb with poor quality. Also, rumor says it was an organized bombing. ""Not a terrorists attack"" The news about this were released way too fast. Before the police even reacted. Some media has already launch a full out (Looks like prepared) campaign. The guy set off the bomb near the path to HongKong flights.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1it0jf/footage_of_a_wheelchair_bound_protester_blowing/cb7tj82)

So the government organizes a bombing, but doesn't want to kill the guy? Alright.

And the media is all in cahoots, so not one of them leaks the story or makes any mention of a conspiracy? That's... odd.

&gt;[So here is my own opinion. There is no way that a man in wheel chair singly handily made from his hometown(few hours away) to Beijing airport and pass all the security check. I call consipricy. If u have not been there. I can tell u that u would been seen by more than 100 camera and requires 2 to 3 bag check to get that far.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1it0jf/footage_of_a_wheelchair_bound_protester_blowing/cb7tj82)

I plead ignorance when it comes to security in China, but with so many citizens, it's hard to believe that the Chinese government has the manpower to check the bags of a single guy three times over the course of a small roadtrip. But don't let logic get in the way, Reddit shot this up to third place.

1374958585.0,201,self.circlebroke,1j6ggk,How to make a Jerkometer Part 2: I coded an actual jerkometer and created a new subreddit for it,acetylserine,241,40,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1j6ggk/how_to_make_a_jerkometer_part_2_i_coded_an_actual/,"Welcome circlebrokers, to my opus magnus, in which I seek to drive circlebroke into a twisted parody of its former self, to drive it further into the circlejerk it shall inevitably be consumed by. This is high effort, you can tell by the slightly flowery and arrogant language. You'll think your'e in /r/circlebrokecirclejerk by the end of this post I promise, if you ever bother reading it. Because, I've quantified the jerk. In my [last post here](https://pay.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1ivw2e/how_to_make_a_subreddit_jerkometer_part_1_a_study/), I came up with some rough metric for measuring the jerkiness of a circlejerk. I called it a Jerkometer, but it wasn't very good and had many problems. but it wasn't really a jerkometer, oh no, because now I've only gone and made an actual one. My real time jerkometer plots the jerkiness of many subreddits onto one graph and also outputs a report for each one. what i found when i did this was mildly surprising. i honestly don't know whether your'e going to like any of this or not.

So, how does it work? how does one go about wasting time in such a pointless way?

Measuring current jerkiness:
The basic idea is that you look through the 25 latest comments of a subreddit (supplied on the /comments page of that subreddit) and test each of these comments for the presence of one or more jerk indicator. The jerk indicators are phrases compiled [manually] into a list beforehand (more on that later) which, surprise, indicate that a jerk is in motion (more on that later too so wait before you blow up at me - i keep saying things like this because we know how redditors jump to conclusions). For each jerk indicator found, increment the jerk rating of that subreddit, until you've looked through all of these 25 comments.

What my jerkometer does:
Every 30 seconds (or some other interval), measure the jerkiness of a list of subreddits then write the data into the next row of a spreadsheet that was created at the start (time /s, atheism, atheismrebooted, etc.). We also want to see the actual jerks going on though, not just the intensity, so every time the jerk rating of a subreddit is measured, a list of the actual jerk indicators found is appended to a report text file generated for each subreddit in the testing list. Each recording is separated by a horizontal rule so that we can see where each recording begins and ends. 

so, now for those jerk indicators then. My list started with a circlebroke [post from a while back](https://pay.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/11ue69/a_list_of_overused_phrases_at_least_the_ones_that/) in order to get the most common reddit phrases, because they indicate general shittiness which is one of the qualities of the good circlejerk, but this list was just a base to start on -  it was not yet a jerk indicator list, and i quickly saw to that. Some of the phrases indicate when redditors are congratulating each other for having the same opinions, with phrases such as 'i agree', 'my thoughts exactly' and 'agreed.' while some indicate strong opinions such as 'fucking disgrace', 'sickening'. 'killed on the spot' (an invocation) and 'yet nothing will be done' (seen in your average nsa jerk for example). Many phrases are jerk subjects such as 'xbox one', 'atheism', 'monsanto', 'edison' and 'zimmerman'. You might say that merely mentioning the word 'religion' isn't indicative of a jerk and your'e right. However, when these words appear repetitively in the reports for each subreddit, it allows us to see what they've been discussing (i.e. what they've been jerking about). The value of searching for jerk subjects will be made more clearly visible soon so don't argue yet. The important thing is to have the subjects people jerk to and their possible redditor reactions to these subjects. Some other point you'd think of is that sometimes we might get false positives. An example of what i mean by this is if the jerkometer searched for EA and flagged up the word 'easy' or searched for 'arab' and found it in 'comparable'. The jerk indicators are all converted to lowercase along with the comment bodies for obvious reasons so this could happen. The way to deal with this is obviously just to try things out, see what works, and remove any jerk indicators which have this problem. The number of false positives is small enough that we don't have to worry. A similar problem is redundance (e.g. 'faith in humanity' flags up both of the indicators 'faith' for religion-based jerks and 'faith in humanity' as the overused phrase, fixed now by making 'faith' and 'humanity' two separate jerk indicators). I like this because it makes some phrases contribute more to a jerk rating than others. this happens very infrequently anyway as you'll see.

Now your'e getting bored and you want to see my jerk indicator list and you want to see some results and then maybe some discussion of them. You may even want to see the jerkometer code. There's quite a lot of data, so i've created a subreddit to post it all on, called r/jerkometer where you can find the code, the jerk indicator list and some resultant data. DON'T GO ON THAT SUBREDDIT YET OR YOU'LL RUIN THIS POST FOR YOU. That's why I omitted the initial forward slash. the first thing i want you to do is look at my jerk indicator list here, and only look at [this list](https://pay.reddit.com/r/jerkometer/comments/1j5lbg/jerk_indicator_list/), nothing else. Note that I did nick the circlebroke theme but it was lovingly done so forgive me, and who's going to see it apart from you lot anyway.

Seen it? Then i'll continue. If you are wondering why i have or havn't included a particular phrase as a jerk indicator, ask away. Many have unique reasons not shared by other phrases (but if I can't justify one i'll obviously remove it). So, what did I get when i first ran the very first version of my code (with a much smaller jerk indicator list)? Well, it was on /r/atheism and i got this:

    faith
    christian
    atheism
    atheism
    nsa
    christian
    atheism
    faith
    violence
    christian
    religion
    atheism
    said it best
    faith
    faith
    religion

...almost like i've distilled the subreddit down to a few words isn't it (wait though, it's amazingly more like a distillation of a subreddit with the current jerk indicator list i'm using). You may say 'of course they are discussing atheism, that's what the subreddit is for' but all will be explained soon. Anyway, I waited a minute then ran it again and got this:

    faith
    christian
    cosmos
    dawkins
    cosmos
    christian
    gold
    religion
    atheism
    religion
    atheism
    sir
    religion
    faith
    atheism

Yay, we got a dawkins! but, wait, what's that...by Sagan...a genuine 'Cosmos' found out in the wild! They must have been talking about their childhood inspirations again. Encouraging results, so I tried another subreddit. Before I show you the results, I want to assure you that i had tested the code and debugged it until it was running perfectly so these are real results and nothing is wrong, people on /r/atheism really do say the words 'faith' and 'religion' that much (actually it turns out that usually it's much more). So, testing the code on /r/conspiracy got me the following:

    ftfy
    nsa
    religious
    american
    citation
    american
    amendment
    gay people
    founding father
    congress
    extremist
    zimmerman
    religious
    american
    lobby
    wealthy elite
    gay people

Now you can better see the effect of having all the 'jerk subject' indicators in the mix because we can see the jerk itself. **It's a case of many weak fibres joining together to make a strong cable**. if we had just one person mention the word 'congress' then we'd see that it wasn't a jerk and so this noise would cancel out  when compared to the number of times 'congress' might be mentioned in an actual jerk. It's like a loose, lone fibre not forming part of a cable, and that, is one of the reasons that this jerkometer works. I can see how 'we can see the jerk itself' might not be convincing to you at this stage, with this meagre data set, but it is clear with the current code and jerk indicator list but WAIT don't look at it yet. just get a feeling for how you can sort of gaugue where the jerk is on the spectrum of all jerks, purely by looking at the list of words and which words are repeated most (and that's what a good jerkometer should do). if you've cheated and looked ahead at the data by now, then your'e morality is bad, and you should...know the rest of this meme. After I did all of this by the way, I realised that i've not really got any proof that any of that data comes from actual comments, so in the subsequent versions of the code, the submission id and comment id (separated by a full stop) is automatically written next to each jerk indicator now so you can go and check it by going on reddit.com/[submission id] then once that loads, tag the comment id onto the end of the current url and proceed.

There's something else I wanted to point out about the interval between jerkometer recordings, but your'e getting tired of my shit now so here's some proper data (linked from the jerkometer subreddit, remember not to look at any other thread on it for now): [here](https://pay.reddit.com/r/jerkometer/comments/1j6eet/jerkometer_output_27th_july_2013_1831_2107/).

*Note that you'll want to download the album for a larger and clearer view of the graph.*

Yep, that's when the latest iteration of the jerkometer was run on 26th July 2013 between 18:31 and 21:07 GMT. I was previously running it for days at a time to perfect the jerk indicator list in order to achieve the best possible jerkometery (that sounds absurd) and it was a bitch to get right, so this is top notch data your'e getting now (well...eh...be nice). As you can see, the list of subreddits the jerkometer was being run on is as follows:

""AskReddit"", ""atheism"", ""atheismrebooted"", ""books"", ""gaming"", ""piano"", ""lifeprotips"", ""IAmA"", ""futurology"", ""explainlikeiama"", ""technology"", ""music"", ""pics"", ""adviceanimals"", ""news"", ""worldnews"", ""science"", ""funny"", ""wtf"", ""politics""

That, as you will notice, includes most of the defaults but also a few smaller less jerky subreddits, some of which i quite like. Looking at the graph, you can instantly see some trends present. By correlating these with the individual subreddit jerk indicator reports, we can discover...many things. Before I talk about those though, there's that recording interval thing I wanted to point out. The recordings are taken every 30 seconds. If the entire /comments page for a subreddit is not completely refilled every 30 seconds then, we will get jerk indicators from the same comments showing up in consecutive recordings. This is intentional, because if no more comments are being made, it is as if the jerkiness is being maintained, e.g. it would level out at some number for consecutive readings, or, if the /comments page was only partly refilled, the jerkometer reading may steadily increase or decrease as new comments appear - think shift-register. If the /comments page was completely refilled, we might get a dramatic increase or decrease and any trends would be difficult to spot as a result. Luckily it is usually the steady change, and only the dramatic change in the very most popular of subreddits (obviously). Anyhow, each complete measurement is far from instantaneous so the time period is probably closer to 60 seconds. now i'm done with that point, onto the discussion of results, finally, now you can see exactly how often /r/technology bring up 1984 and more importantly, how frequently the phrase 'nice try' is used!

**Discussion of Results**

For this bit, continuity of reading isn't important so feel free to jump ahead to the paragraphs you like the look of. If you've jumped here without reading any of the above, go back and read it or you won't understand what it's about. Certainly don't think you can comment on any of it anyway until youv'e read all of the above. I'm now going to have to keep it short because I'm not going to have access to a computer for a while now, so i want to get this done, which means that I won't be able to discuss the results as much as i'd like so i'll let you do most of the thinking. here are my first impressions anyway.

-----

**surprisingly unjerky subreddits**

/r/AskReddit,/r/wtf (most of the time), /r/funny and /r/pics are nowhere near as jerky as i thought, which is either an indicator that my jerkometer is up the spout, or that my presumptions were  bad. As it happens, those subreddits aren't that jerky if you have a look. Our general impression of their shittiness comes about from the fact that there are pun threads EVERYWHERE and consistently in the top comments too. Ooh, a picture of a woman snapped in half under a car? [Let's make puns about her flexibility!](https://pay.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1j5tav/a_horrible_accident_nsfw/cbbficl)' for example. Pun threads aren't really circlejerks so that's fine (maybe you might disagree though). Anyhow, there's no way I can quickly or easily write something to detect pun threads, given their ecelectic range of subjects. /r/music is another surprisingly unjerky one. I think this could be due to my unfamiliarity with its common jerks, meaning that i won't have stuck them into the jerk indicator list. If you think you can make it better, don't keep quiet about it!


-----

**surprisingly jerky subreddits**

i like /r/explainlikeiama a lot, but somehow, despite it being a place of many explanations, it's quite jerky. Must be in the replies. Still not sure how jerky it actually is. /r/futurology also is much jerkier than I expected. I'm not sure what to say about that because unless you often visit it you wouldn't know whether this is true or not. 


-----

**/r/atheism and /r/atheismrebooted**

you knew this was coming. In my last post here, I crudely compared the two and found /r/atheism to be much jerkier. I can now disclose that the truth in this depends on the time of day BUT /r/atheism is indeed a lot jerkier the vast majority of the time. You can't see that from the last piece of data I refered you to so you'll have to trust me or look at the [other bit of data I posted](https://pay.reddit.com/r/jerkometer/comments/1j5j36/jerkometer_output_26th_july_2150_2303/). As I said previously, this can be attributed to the difference between the number of active subscribers. In fact, because of this I would be surprised if I found otherwise. It is actually a testament to the powerful jerkiness of /r/atheismrebooted that it can at times outjerk even its progenitor.

-----

**but what about the intentional circlejerks?**

Why didn't I test the jerkometer on subreddits that are supposed to be jerky, like /r/circlejerk or something? Wouldn't this be a good way to calibrate it? Well, I did in the early stages, and i didn't feel that it was very useful because, and this may shock you, in normal subreddits people don't really make comments in which the word 'this' is repeated forty times. It's worth saying though that if you do test it out, /r/circlejerk is impressively, and suitably, jerky. Whether it outjerks /r/atheism though is something we'll have to investigate at a later time. In fact, in future I intend to run the jerkometer on only a few subreddits at a time because posting the reports for even one subreddit when the jerkometer is run for a longer period of time will be annoying and tedious (can't be bothered automating, i'll stick at auto-formatting the reports for reddit and that's it).

-----
**the most all-consuming jerk on reddit**

We know that the NSA jerk is everywhere. It was commented here the other day that this jerk alone could provide circlebroke with enough material to last the whole month. Seeing snowden and the NSA mentioned as many times as it is though was still quite an eye-opener. Have a look and see. 

-----

**Last of all...**

if you'd like to have a go at improving my jerkometer or making your own completely different one, come along to /r/jerkometer and see what you can come up with. I was actually originally planning on making a jerkometer which uses /r/circlejerk on the grounds that humans are good at spotting jerks so the activity and content of the mock circlejerk reddits should reflect the true jerkiness of reddit overall. However, the rationing thing going on there right now and the poor specificity of the idea put me off it. Anyway, thanks for reading if you've made it this far, and I apologise in advance for not using helvetica.

No different than large Nazi sects gaining power all throughout Europe. Their governments are theocratic - so their religious beliefs and political affiliations are connected at the hip.

Note: I really rushed this, I repeat myself a lot and my argument is horribly disorganized. I apologize. I also didn't really look through any of the quotes

Thing is, they claim to be mad about the fact that Morgan Freeman was not the one answering questions. I don’t know if they're right. Maybe they are. But it’s not the real reason why they’re mad. 

They’re mad because they didn’t get their end of the ""social media promotion bargaining transaction"". Celebrities promote themselves and their work and  boring, normal, average people get to feel special because they had some personal interaction with said celebrity. Celebrity gets some good will, the redditors get their 30 seconds of feeling special and a break from their horribly mundane and oppressively average life. 

Contrast the Morgan Freeman or Woody Harrelson AMA with some of the more successful AMAs in the past. The first Louis CK one where he was transparently promoting his digital comedy release, or when Obama came here while campaigning. Yeah, it’s pretty obvious they were here to promote, but they did it in a way that feed into the egos of the users. “Yeah I’m here to promote some shit but I’m *really* here with you cool folks because you’re so awesome and cool and hilarious”. Right. 

The reality is that redditors are OK with using ama to promote yourself, just look at the Obama AMA or look at the Louis CK ama. You just have to pander to their egos and make them think that you’re there because redditors are just so cool and awesome  and oh yeah have you heard they’re running for office/releasing a 5 dollar comedy on the internet/have a new album coming out? 

Celebrities use social media and their fans egos to promote themselves. This is a big factor of why twitter is so popular. The chance that anyone from Joss Whedon or Kim Kardashian will interact with something you do or say makes you feel great and important and creates tons of good will for the celebrities brand. This makes you rush to give them their money. 

But when you strip everything away, make them realize that yeah, it’s just advertising and no, you’re not special, they get really, really mad and really really angry. 

Granted, much criticism could be leveled on the PR people for not knowing how to do it. Social media is different from your normal interview junket, and you have to play the game. But come on people, you're not fucking special. 

I'd like to end it with some famous and wise words:

Let’s focus on the film people. 

edit: Because the mods want quotes, I'll give you a couple quotes. To AMA's credit many there, judging by the comments that actually made it to the top do get the fact that celebrities are there to promote movies and create goodwill.

&gt;The problem is that the titles says ""I am Morgan Freeman Ask Me Anything"", But it's not Morgan Freeman. Personally, I think if someone is lying in their post, it should be removed entirely.

&gt;EDIT: To everyone saying ""everyone lies on Reddit"": you need to realize that this subreddit is supposed to require adequate proof. Legitimate proof if what separates /r/iama from the rest of Reddit.

I'd bet the vast majority of these things are filtered through a PR rep or social media person. I know someone who was involved with a pretty successful AMA in the past year and that's how it was done.

&gt;Hey, I am with the OP on this one. If there is going to be an IAMA it needs to be that person. I can understand Barack Obama likely needs someone standing over his shoulder saying ""Hey, you might not want to use the word cock Mr. President.""

&gt;This isn't about a celebrity owing anyone anything, it is about the democracy that this site normally upholds. You can sell as much of yourself and your movies and your products on Reddit as you want, just be the actual person doing the selling.

Yes, the reason why reddit is soo mad is becuase it maybe just wasn't actually Morgan Freeman. Just ask Woody Harrelson!

&gt;You don't need to come here with a product or something to make AMA worth it. If you do a good AMA that can and will be good publicity. I'll walk by the cinema or see a commercial: ""Hmm, Morgan Freeman is a cool actor and he did an AMA on reddit, which showed that he's actually a really cool person too, i'll check this shit out"" ( Wheter that means actually seeing or purchasing the product, or checking out via trailers. In any case you make me think POSITIVELY of you &amp; your work. I personally am a fan of Depp &amp; Downey Jr &amp; I check out their work just because I think they are really cool. Make a good AMA, make me a fan of yours. Hell, before Snoop Doggs ( Lion ) AMA, I did not really know much or care much about his music, but after that I checked it out and some stuff found their place on my playlists. Hell, I even tell my friends what a cool guy Snoop is. That's good publicity.

If you do an AMA and I like you I might actually pirate your work!

&gt;I scanned this thread and am confused as to why the OP is getting so much hate.

&gt;This subreddit is abused by celebrities touting new movies, wanna be politicos, small time bands trying to get cheap PR, CEO's for companies trying to counteract negative social media and ...
well ... basically people trying to manipulate redditors to make a buck or get elected.

&gt;This has been a big trend lately, and while I was sick of ""I AM POLYAMOROUS AMA."" threads, this new trend is not good.

Too bad, bub. Reddit's admins love the celebritity AMAs because they [bring so much attention and page views to the site.](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/08/potus-iama-stats.html)

&gt;The proof image was manipulated. Mods andOR admins took money for the stunt no question.
Yeah it was doctored. I loaded it into Photoforensics and the way the details on the paper appear white, while everything else in the image is not, means that it was saved a second time with the details added.

&gt;http://fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=f338dad45bd44f470440ca38ea7c62c87b749f6e.329624 

Here is some evidence that Morgan Freeman's ""proof"" was faked. Ergo ipso facto, the /r/IAMA mods were paid big bucks for this promotion. Logic'ed. 

&gt;&gt;What the hell? This thread just got removed from the front page and the text deleted.

&gt;Reddit censorship...or more Freeman PR intervention? Hopefully they do something about the issue.

The /r/Iama mods need to earn their salary, dammit.

But, I remember what attracted me to Reddit so much. New awesome content. I enjoyed all of the jokes before they were ran into the ground. I loved all of the advice animals until there were two new ones every day. I was happy to stand with Reddit against SOPA and PIPA. /r/funny used to make me laugh.

So, probably the best part of Reddit is finding a new and functioning community for me.

If you are a TRUE 90s kid, then you should know the movie Space Jam and the song by the Quad City DJs that came out with it. If I remember the story correctly, somebody noticed that you could mesh the song pretty well with many other songs because the beat and timing was pretty common.

This spawned a sub, /r/comeonandslam. The sub still goes strong with new submissions and requests daily. My personal favorite so far is [the Spaceballs mashup](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFOT_3Q_xaE).

If you want to find something you might like, the sub is currently hosting a Best Of competition [over here.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/comeonandslam/comments/18v1kl/official_best_of_slam_jams_nominations_here/)

1360759680.0,201,self.circlebroke,18fxa7,"The LAPD is bad, so Dorner is good; or: The False Dichotomy of r/videos",Wayne_Bruce,248,47,286,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/18fxa7/the_lapd_is_bad_so_dorner_is_good_or_the_false/,"So [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/18f32f/dorner_shoot_out_police_say_to_burn_down_the_cabin/) thread apparently details some pretty shocking things the LAPD has done to get Dorner.

I'm not here to complain about what treatment the LAPD is getting, because I don't really know the full story. What I do know is that Dorner has allegedly killed innocent people, he doesn't seem to have denied that, and his manifesto is filled with the ravings of an evil man.

So, what does Reddit think? He's a goddamn hero.

To the prospect of Dorner escaping, one Redditor wrote:
&gt;To be honest, I hope he did [escape]. If the police were going to skip their responsibilities and show how corrupt they can be by burning a man alive without trial... let's just say I hope that Doner, if he escaped, fixes the problem, because the system obviously won't.

&gt;Yeah, I'm rooting for a bad guy, but there will be no winners in this now, or later.

Or this oft repeated gem:

&gt;Police explicitly refuse to allow news helicopters and news crews on the scene, cabin ""mysteriously"" erupts in flames. Even without the police scanner, let's face it. Everyone knows what really happened.

How dare the police try not to let the killer know that they're coming for him so he can easily escape!

&gt;it seems pretty obvious he had some dirt they didn't want getting out from the way they were ready to execute him without warning on sight

Or maybe, just maybe, he's a murderous psychopath who has killed several cops. But that's what they *want* you to think!

Also, if had dirt, why not write it in his manifesto?

&gt;Alright, so the guy isn't a hero... but he is as guilty as any of the LAPD by the sound of it.

Okay, not only does this person sound very reluctant to say he isn't a hero (which is really creepy), but they also imply the whole LAPD is corrupt. Every single one of them is as bad as this 'probably not a hero'.

&gt;What sucks the most is that A.) He didn't kill the crooked cops that he wanted to B.) He killed one cop and injured another that were just doing their jobs.

Again, the man has killed **innocent people completely unconnected to the alleged corruption**.

&gt;If I were writing the movie I'd make him start the fire. He'd have a few of the scuba tanks he was seen filling. He'd dig a pit in a corner and bury himself after setting the upper floors on fire. The heat rises so he wouldn't burn and the scuba tanks would ensure he had air. Once the firemen show up he'd rise from his shallow pit take out a firefighter and then steal his clothes to make his escape in the chaos. 

This isn't a movie, this is serious shit. I get jokes, I get all that, but can we not have people saying ""this'd make a great movie"" after several innocent people have been injured or killed?

Bonus time!
Redditors also can't seem to agree whether or not tear gas could start a fire (the term 'burners' is agreed to refer to hot tear gas canisters), however both parties use their side to prove that the police burned the place down.

&gt;just heard on the news from some spokesman that a tear gas grenade started the fire. Hmmm, then why were the officers saying burn it down?

and

&gt;Same shit happened at Waco, FBI claimed that the tear gas started the fire, but it was proven that it was impossible for those chemicals to start a fire. Fucking lying hypocrites.

As opposed to...

&gt;They are gas canisters (tear gas). There are 'cold' canisters and 'hot' canisters. The hots combust more dramatically than colds and have been known to start fires. I heard somewhere earlier that hots aren't meant to be used firing into a building.

and

&gt;Likely the same CS gas used during the WACO raid that ""accidentially"" started the fires that killed everyone inside.

I don't mean to defend the police here; like everyone else, I don't know the full story. I also don't mean to diminish the tragedy of Waco. I just think it's a little weird when people are presenting completely opposing arguments to argue the same thing.

1345570906.0,200,self.circlebroke,yl9bg,"[MOD POST] Welcome new subscribers!  We thought it best to run over some things for you all, as well as clarify some things for some of our regulars.",aco620,225,25,186,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yl9bg/mod_post_welcome_new_subscribers_we_thought_it/,"I’d like to run over some things in this subreddit, most of which are in the sidebar, but some of which could use some clarification.  I can be a bit wordy at times, so bear with me here.

* **Why does this subreddit exist?** – This subreddit was created when r/atheism did their Faces of Atheism stunt.  The absolutely insane levels of smug caused waves of people in r/circlejerk to break character and talk about how insane these people must be.  Dhamster took it upon himself to create a subreddit where people could complain about things they didn’t like on Reddit without using satire.  We’ve implemented rules and guidelines over time to help build and keep the subreddit organized.  Think of this place like a more whiney /r/theoryofreddit  or a more serious /r/circlejerk .

* **So do you all just hate Reddit?  What's the point in even being here? -** No, we don't all hate Reddit.  Many of us just hate certain things we see on Reddit.  Complaining can be cathartic and fun.  [Here is a great comment that puts it in perspective.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/yk8fo/jagoojiojoi_explains_the_main_difference_between/c5wgih1?context=1)  And here's the kind of comments that can result [from analyzing and criticizing this website.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vqy9y/dear_circlebrokers_what_changes_would_you_make_to/c56x55f)

* **Why is there a Circlebroke 2?**  - Circlebroke 2 is more or less what Circlebroke 1 was in its early days.  Complain about whatever you want, however you want, without having to worry about putting in too much effort or having your comment removed for being too circlejerky.  We also added a few emotes and advice animals to play with and regularly hold contests in there.
  
* **Why are there so many mods in Circlebroke 2?**  - No real reason.  Dhamster just kind of threw a bunch of us in there when he first made the subreddit.  Maybe as a thank you for helping build the sub in the first place.  Maybe just so he wouldn’t have to do any work in there.  Try not to think too much about it.

* **So what do I do in Circlebroke exactly?**  - This is a place to vent.  If you see something that regularly happens on Reddit or something that has gotten a lot of attention that frustrates you, bring it here.  You don’t HAVE to use specific link examples, but we prefer it.  Also, try to give us as much to work with as possible.  A submission that has nothing but a link and one line of text isn’t going to generate a lot of discussion and we may tag it with negative flair or just remove it altogether.  [This is an example of what we SHOULDN'T be seeing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yja7f/retro_in_which_the_hivemind_gloats_how_superior/c5wgdkb)  What happened is explained [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yja7f/retro_in_which_the_hivemind_gloats_how_superior/c5whl8s)

* **Yeah, what’s the deal with the flair anyway?  Who are you assholes to tell me what a good post is?** – First off, those are fighting words, and we ban people that can’t talk to other people in this subreddit without resorting to childish name calling.  The flair is meant to encourage people to put some effort into their posts.  We’d like this place to have as much discussion as possible.  If you just want to say “fuck this post, amirite!?”  And are looking for somewhat of the same response, that’s what Circlebroke 2 is for.  You have options.  There's even a /r/circlebrokecirclejerk if you wanna say ""fuck this place"" and just make fun of us.  We also arbitrarily tag posts we like and would like to see more of with Quality Post flair.  There are a few users that have special image flair for their contributions to the subreddit as well.

* **Why can't I complain about /r/atheism or /r/politics  whenever I feel like it?** - Before we started organizing this sub, /r/atheism was probably 90% of the posts in here.  With the upcoming election, we've seen just as many /r/politics posts.  So we've relegated those to weekly megathreads where people can get it all out of their system in one go.  If you don't want to wait for the megathread, you're free to take your post over to /r/circlebroke2.  Adding on to that, try not to cling too much to the low hanging fruit.  If you see a handful of posts talking about a specific idea or subreddit, give it some time to digest and come back to that argument at a later time.  For instance, even though it's a somewhat obscure subreddit, we recently had a large influx of posts about /r/childfree in a very short span of time.  Use the search bar and see how recent your idea has been talked about.  We'd rather not have to make any more megathreads.

*EDIT:* We have since made some changes with regards to the megathreads.  Check to see which ones are currently active.  

* **Why are some of you orange?** – That’s our Helvetica flair.  We give it occasionally to users that submit quality content on a regular basis.  Sort of a way of saying, thanks for doing a good job around here, you're what we want to see more of in this sub.  We don't do it *too* often, but if you’re interested in it, bring a few examples to us in modmail and we’ll see where we go from there.

* **What if I don’t want to just circlejerk over something?  Can I argue against things posted in here?** - YES!  In fact, we *encourage* opposing arguments.  Unfortunately, there isn’t much we can do about the way people vote, as it’s of course anonymous, but we like to see people arguing topics in here.  It doesn’t have to be a black and white issue of “The hive mind is wrong because this is the right answer.”  HOWEVER, if you come into our subreddit insulting people for their views because you think Circlebroke is too uptight or whiney, we will ban you for fighting words.  We *know* that this place is oftentimes a circlejerk.  In a place meant for complaining, you're oftentimes going to find people in the comments that are upset with the same thing.  

* **What if I have a concern about the subreddit itself?  Can I make a [META] post or any other sort of post discussing the subreddit itself?**  No.  No you cannot.  This subreddit has gotten far too many [META] posts since its inception to the point that he had to ban them.  If you have a concern about the way the subreddit is run, message the moderators.  We’ve also recently created /r/circlebrokediscussion  for anyone wanting to discuss the subreddit.

* **I’ve found, like, 50 offshoot Circlebroke subs….why?** – Most of them are just there for fun.  Don’t take it too seriously.  

* **Wait, so you guys are affiliated with r/shitredditsays?** – No.  No. No.  Circlebroke is not SRS lite.  Shitredditsays does not hold a monopoly on topics of racism and sexism.  If someone wants to talk about that on Circlebroke, it’s fine.  If you don’t want to read it, skip past it and look for a post talking about a different subreddit, or better yet, make the kind of post you want to see in the subreddit.  Be the change, don’t just complain about other people not entertaining you properly.  Just don’t do it in a [META] post.  With regards to SRS though, we do not ban people for breaking the circlejerk, we do not have a stylesheet full of image macros and emotes, and we do not focus solely on specific issues like race and gender.  Everyone is entitled to make the complaint they want to so long as they can back up their argument.  That being said, a number of our subscribers *do* frequent SRS and we have no issue with them.  We have no issue with ANYONE that subscribes to this subreddit so long as they follow the rules.  

* Following up on that, we don’t care what you’re known for outside of this subreddit, whether you're a troll, a novelty account, or a power user, leave that at the door.  We *will* ban in-character trolls and novelties and if we see people starting drama with power users solely because they have popular usernames, those people will be removed as well. 

* Following up on THAT we do not attack individual users in or linked to this subreddit, and we are not a troll board.  You can cite specific comments if it’s part of your overall argument, but don’t single out individuals in any way whatsoever that might encourage an attack on them, and don't go into threads linked here for the purpose of mocking people.  And **NO** vote brigading!  Stay out of other people's comment section, unless you plan on joining in on the conversation like any other subscriber would.  That gives Circlebroke a bad reputation that we don't want.

This subreddit is constantly growing and we can’t always see every comment that’s posted.  We encourage people to message the moderators with questions or concerns and to report anyone they think is breaking the rules.  Be sure to read over our sidebar, we have an active moderation team, and we try to keep an eye on this sub the best we can.

Not surprisingly, hundreds of people responded, and it appears that almost none of them are actually scientists. There is one microbiologist, and otherwise people are just listing things off the Wikipedia common misconceptions page to act smugly superior to all those people who aren't brave sci[ent]ists. 

You can look through yourself to see how people make fun of all ""those"" people who hold common misconceptions. And the one about a ""theory"" being relatively certain compared to a hypothesis comes up about 50 times (I made that number up but it's still a lot) followed by an evolution circle jerk. Individual comments aren't that jerky, but just the aggregate [hence the low effort, look yourself] of people smugly patting themselves on the back for not being completely ignorant is annoying. Also, I thought it was amusing how we make fun of Redditors for being ""brave scientists,"" but they apparently answer to a ""calling all scientists"" question.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_15mwd1,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/15mwd1/an_askreddit_thread_addressed_to_scientists_of/,

&gt; This is ridiculous. A child has no relation to a happily ever after.

Oh no! What the fuck is wrong with some people? I can't believe that anyone in the world might want to have kids! It's so weird and stupid, anyone who does it is literally retarded.

&gt; Barf- This is worse than thinking about how much Disney changed all those stories in the first place.

Look, people, I know Fanfic usually isn't all that well received (that I've seen on Reddit), and this doesn't really fall under that, but why is this exactly so bad? Because you can't stand to face in the direction of something a child has touched?

When it comes to anything, politics, sports, religion, it's just much easier to hate something if you can convince yourself that those that disagree with you are irrational and want to silence you.

And thusly, we have [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/14itn3/i_just_got_banned_from_rconservative_for_posting/)

The user is boasting about how he got banned from /r/conservative (and, as we know, not believing in God and having conservative politics is absolutely impossible) for disagreeing with a particular post. Now I'm not going to get into the politics of this issue, because that's not what made this post go downhill. I've talked before about /r/atheism's [persecution complex](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/13lelp/bizarre_obscure_law_in_kentucky_literally/). Well, here we have yet another example.

&gt; [Conservatives REALLY do not like to be disagreed with in any way, shape, or form. They prefer to have their own cocoon-like world to live in, complete with their own slanted news network (Fox), their own form of science (chrisitianity) and their own culture.

Top comment. Note how there's not the slightest bit of irony detected here. This man, on reddit, believes that conservatives here do not like to deal with opposing viewpoints. On *reddit*. Where the subreddit erroneously said to cover politics' number three link is currently ""Robert F. Kennedy Jr: Fox News Has Divided Country In A Way Not Seen Since Civil War."" Clearly, conservatives are the ones who refuse to entertain opposing views.

This was on the *conservative* subreddit, mind you. They are under no obligation to entertain your views. If the mods want to delete your post because the entire point of your post was essentially ""all of you are wrong"" then they have every right to. But no, you /r/conservative users who have to deal with my politics on every other subreddit on this site will deal with them in your subreddit as well or you're a fascist.

&gt; [I got banned from /r/Conservative after the election for saying that more than others, conservatives tend to live in a conservative information bubble.

Holy hell, imagine that! A subreddit designed as an outlet for one particular viewpoint doesn't care for you screaming about how they're wrong and you're right! Fucking nazis!

Honestly, how fucking dare they?

As if the comments from the link to the video weren't bad enough, it gets even worse. For an analysis of those, see here: http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1dyjm1/how_to_make_broad_assumptions_about_a_situation/

So, let's kick it off with this post.

&gt;Her apathy during that scene disgust me. It's like she doesn't care and the kids will suffer.

More like not causing a big unprofessional scene by arguing with the student. He was obviously disrupting class, and the teacher did nothing wrong by sending him out of her class before further disruption ensued. Professional and reasonable; she simply removed the problem out of the classroom. Not a big deal, right? 

&gt; He's right. The education system is broken. I hated school more than anything. Some teachers just shouldn't be where they are. What creativity I had in my early teens was drained from my soul by my teachers and the endless homework that was shoved down my throat. You know the way some people say that your school years are the best years of your life? They lied. It's bullshit. 

""Hey, this kid hates school just like me! He must know what he's talking about."" Once again, reddit manages to overdramatize the situation, this poor poor redditor had all of his creativity drained from his broken soul! And homework? God forbid teachers assign you homework. School's not supposed to be easy. 

Then there's this voice of reason:

&gt;Jeff dropped out of school and came back. He is NOT in a regular classroom. He is in a ""go at your own pace"" class for credit retrieval. It is a class with like 30 kids in it who are all at different points in their high school career - they are all working at different grade levels and different subjects. It would be impossible to teach this class through traditional means. Hence, the packet work. He had the opportunity to be in a regular classroom and turned his back on it. This is what is available to him now. Whether or not you agree with the packet teaching is one thing, but there is no way a school is going to put an 18 year old sophomore in class with a bunch of 15 year olds.

Here we go. This is the crucial information we lacked before, and it changes the entire context of the video. Jeff is no longer the glorious warrior of education we once thought he was. He dropped out. He had his chance to learn at his pace, at his level, but turned his back on it. Now he's in a classroom with different people at all kinds of levels, and he complains about the teaching methods?

&gt;""Could have expressed his views in a more appropriate way"". Like a way that would have been ignored and not brought unwanted attention on their lazy teachers.

The only reason this got attention was because it went viral. Instead of rushing to the front of the room and disrupting the class, he could have had a meeting with the teacher, a talk with his principle, or with any other staff member. Dramatic? Sure. That's why it's gotten this much attention. Wrongly executed? Absolutely.

&gt; why does piracy exist adobe?

&gt;The board should fire this fuckwit. 

There's an interesting dichotomy going on. On one hand, they're saying that they already pirate all the adobe software. On the other hand, they're saying that NOW this is going to make them pirate. Is piracy a tool for vengeance or is it used simply because you don't want to pay? I'm leaning towards the latter.

Oh really, NOW you have no regret?

&gt; Adobe are thieves. I can't wait until something else comes along and sends them the way of the dodo.

I think that this demonstrates the dangerousness of the internet mob mentality. Not  for the adobe CEO(he's doing just fine) but for anyone who shows up on reddit and get pummeled by the internet mob. What if it's someone who's emotionally unstable? Or too young to deal with this?

With that being said, I do not consider myself a hardcore gamer along the lines of those who seem to perpetuate Reddit.  I'm sorry if this is an overgeneralization due to the loudness of the people who consider themselves REALLY HARDCORE GAMERS, but it's something that's been bothering me for a while now: **quit attacking other people who don't like video games as much as you do**.

It's a persecution complex not entirely unlike the ""check your privilege"" response from the obese- they don't want to change their habits and want to feel justified about what they enjoy.  Today, it's taken the form of this AskReddit thread: 

**[Why is it socially acceptable to watch hours upon hours of TV &amp; Netflix, but when someone plays video games for hours and hours, we're addicted and wasting time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/116xvc/why_is_it_socially_acceptable_to_watch_hours_upon/)**

Well, as I think that most people could attest to, it isn't socially acceptable to spend hours upon hours watching TV &amp; Netflix- anybody healthy enough to do other things yet chooses to invest that much time in that kind of entertainment is going to be labelled anti-social, because I don't think you can possibly maintain that kind of intake with work/school and a social life- one has to go.

The OP goes on to say that, 
&gt;My roomates used to call me a nerd and anti-social because I would rather play games in my spare time than sit on the couch all day like they did and watch re-runs of sitcoms. What are some rebuttals?
 
To be fair, I don't know the specifics of the situation, but the fiery nature of the question gives me the feeling that he feels persecuted, which makes him assign untrue traits to the roommates in question.  In his mind, watching reruns of sitcoms is just as solitary an activity as gaming tends to be, but in my experience it's the opposite.

Last year, I roomed with a great bunch of guys, and we spent a lot of time watching shows on Netflix together- the Office, Supernatural, 30 Rock, etc., and we bonded quite a bit by sharing the experience.  I personally love each of those shows, so most of them were re-runs to me, but I didn't care; watching them with my roommates was an entirely different experience to watching them alone.

The other thing that the OP (and many people in the thread) are missing is that sitcoms are meant to be more of a shared experience than most games are- not knowing what happend on last night's episode of the Office is a much more socially-isolating incident than not being able to talk about how cool Skyrim is.

The top comment in the thread doesn't offer advice to the OP as to how, even if the OP didn't intend to be, he could have been perceived as anti-social by sitting in his room with his door closed playing Team Fortress 2 while his roommates socialized in the main room, but instead explains that gaming is more interactive than watching TV.  He does make the point that society can see gaming as having too much effort put into it for minimal returns, but I don't really think that that's the case.  After all, how many college freshmen don't love hold at least a few Call of Duty marathons per semester?

Then we get this beauty a bit further down: 

&gt;[People who spend 6+ hours a day on Facebook are 'being social'. People who spend 6+ hours a day on WoW are pathetic nerdlosers who will die foreveralone virgins. At least that's what everyone who doesn't play WoW and spends all day on Facebook seems to think, anyway.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/116xvc/why_is_it_socially_acceptable_to_watch_hours_upon/c6jv0v1)

Let me be clear: there is NO POSSIBLE WAY to spend SIX HOURS on Facebook and be considered social.  I'd go so far as to say that the more you see someone on Facebook, the more you know they don't aren't as social, because as anybody with a hint of a social life can tell you, Facebook is nothing like actually being with friends.

In direct reply, we get this: 
&gt;[As someone who manages to complete both of those feats, I have somehow managed to become a social nerd virgin. It's weird and bad... Mostly bad. Whatever.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/116xvc/why_is_it_socially_acceptable_to_watch_hours_upon/c6jwrgb)

I'm not shocked.  At no point does anybody have even a hint of self-awareness that maybe, just maybe, spending time with *actual people* might be the answer to their attached stigma of ""that anti-social guy"".

We also get:

&gt;[Gaming actually requires more brain power. Watching TV is a passive act and requires minimal thinking. You actually have to interact when you play a video game.

OP posts a video of a young girl playing Vivaldi on her electric guitar.  Unfortunately, OP's title makes some redditors a little too butthurt.  What follows is some of the worst armchair criticism I've come across.  

Well, maybe not the worst, but it hits home as I'm also a guitarist.  How do you know someone is a guitarist?  Don't worry...they'll...*ahem* tell you.

Thankfully, you have to dig a little to get to the bashing, but there are still enough upvotes to get the commenters up there, in the middle of the thread.

An accomplished technical guitarist comes out of the woodwork!

&gt;19 year technical guitarist here, let me explain the downside and upside of this girls talent and answer the questions that have been posed-
The people saying ""Anyone can do this"" are mostly correct, the song can be learned easily and with slow, methodical practice it can be perfected. It would take a lot of time and I'm sure this is not the only thing she can play this well.
On the other hand, the amount of ""flavor"" put into her piece is minimal, she is playing it from raw memory but not adding any flair or feeling to the piece. In the musical world she would be considered a parrot- She can play the piece but is missing a big part of what makes it musical to the ear.
From 1-10 I would give it a 6, add her age and it is closer to an 8 but compare her talent to a classical musician of the same age and she is no asian violinist.

Other classical musicians join the jerk.

&gt;Totally agree with you. As a young classical violist, I find it strange how many people worship this kind of stuff. Music isn't just about being able to play difficult stuff, it's about being able to play it with style and musicality. And that's something hard to teach the average listener.
Nevertheless, this is still impressive to me as all young talent is. The problem is simply that I don't get why it's on the front page when there's much more young talent out there. I get the feeling that just because she played a fast piece that sounded hard is the reason people are impressed, and that's not the reason why people should be impressed with music.
&gt;&gt;I'll tell you why it is on the frontpage. It is a 14 year old girl playing a cool song in a cool way on a cool instrument, and yeah she's pretty talented. Its not like you need to be some damn prodigy to deserve to get some recognition.
In general I think its pathetic to watch all the armchair experts in this thread looking down on her because she's not good enough to fit into whats their idea of a good musician.

Thankfully, a voice of reason replied to the jerk.  Moving on!

&gt;Not that the girl doesnt have talent, but every ""awesome kid"" video is just simplistic seeming shredding with no feeling to it. It wasnt interesting to listen to. Its the same thing Ive heard a thousand times. She was just going by the numbers. I wasnt really that impressed.

Right, because every 14-year old guitarist can play Vivaldi and Eruption note-for-note.  I think one of the biggest downsides to the internet is people become very hard to impress, because you have this pool of ""awesome kid"" videos and they're unaware that, in the real world, that's a real small percentage of the population that's that precocious on their instrument.

Lots of butthurt violinists!

&gt;To become a really great violinist, you will find yourself practicing for 10 or more hours a day for years and years of your life (with the very real possibility that you just aren't good). Guitar solos are typically not that difficult and you just don't need to practice them very long to make it sound ""crazy.""

Riiiight.  Because Steve Vai and Joe Satriani were naturals.  They didn't spend 12+ hrs a day on their instruments.  Oh wait, they totally did.

This one's probably my favorite:

&gt;This girl is well on her way, no doubt about it, but people who are blown away by videos like this are usually non-musicians. I'm extremely impressed by watching people who woodwork, for instance, because I'm shit at it and don't have a clue, even if it is fairly basic technique in the eyes of the woodworker. It's just a matter of perspective - what's amazing to one person might be less than spectacular to another.

I think once people learn how to do something, they forget how hard it is to learn it.  All the blood, sweat and tears are just rose-colored memories now.

That about covers the worst offenders.  Plenty of children in the parent thread to get worked up over.  If there would be a TL;DR for this post, I'd say it's this comment:

&gt;Musician here. Here I am giving feedback about why she isn't great, but not necessarily bad either. Now I'm telling you why people shouldn't be that impressed despite her age because a lot of people are good at playing instruments. Except me. I'm just average. But fortunately you don't know that. Also, I'm jealous. I fucking suck.

Look, when I was that age, I was only playing guitar for a year, and I would've killed to have this skill level.  People that are bitching need to remember *she's a fourteen year old girl* and wipes the floor with lots of guitarists already.  Plenty of folks don't make it past G C D and ""Smoke on the Water"".  Reading all the armchair criticism is why I really hate Reddit sometimes.  And yet I still peruse this place.  Maybe *I'm* the butthurt one.

How many guitarist does it take to change a lightbulb?  Ten:  One to screw in the lightbulb and nine to say they could've done it better.

But what doesn't get talked about too often ([outside of that whole Trapped_in_Reddit incident from a while back](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/vefen/recap_trapped_in_reddits_witch_hunt/)) is the acceptance of reposted comments.  

[Here's a popular, reposted submission from this morning that got me thinking about this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/12gb1j/murder_murder_murder_snuggle/)  The top comment immediately points out that not only is this a repost, but that they're going to repost the top comment from its previous submission in response (which set off a chain of reposted comments.)  That's not what I'm talking about though.

[In reaction to finding out this is a repost we have a series of constantly reposted reaction and vote gifs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/12gb1j/murder_murder_murder_snuggle/c6ut7dm)

I noticed in /r/circlebroke2 recently a post pointing out the repetitive reaction to people's usernames and or novelty accounts.  A lot of people are aware already that Shitty_Watercolour's posts are usually responded to with comments that he reminds them of [Quentin Blake](http://www.reddit.com/r/Shitty_Watercolour/comments/1055q4/i_am_shitty_watercolour_ask_me_anything/c6ahrio).  

[In this particular post that I mentioned a moment ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/12dmkd/cb1_was_too_good_for_my_effort_post_apparently_so/), it was noted that the Redditor with the username /u/SUSAN_IS_A_BITCH consistently gets replies that have less to do with whatever s/he has to say, and more to do with the username in question.

Finally there's the consistently witch-hunted users, the most notable of which is /u/warphalange.  This guy can not submit a single comment without being reminded of the [/r/gaming submission from 8 months ago where he faked cancer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/qdmb8/the_same_day_my_doctor_told_me_my_cancer_was/c3wsz9s)  A search for warphalange in /r/subredditdrama brings up [TEN](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/search?q=warphalange&amp;restrict_sr=on) submissions, all of which involve the exact same comment threads of ""[You faked cancer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/zzdl1/my_greatest_victory/c692bgv)""  I won't get into the right and wrongs of that one, it's been tossed back and forth on SRD enough by now. 

So what is the reason behind this acceptance?  Is it because less people read the comment section and that the comment section is too large to keep track of how often things have been posted?  Is it because witch hunting is a past time on Reddit and regardless of how often something is said and how little it has to do with the topic, Redditors feel it NEEDS to be said again and again for the sake of justice?  What about reaction gifs, why aren't those considered reposts, Sagan knows they're used ad nauseum?  And the reaction to people's usernames like [nota](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/11klqj/that_poor_child/c6ncut2)methaddict, [POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/x0u8n/a_challenge_for_potatoe_in_my_anus_fixed/), and drunk_otter ([who got so many of the same comments that he began compiling them into his own subreddit,](http://www.reddit.com/r/youredrunkotter/)) why do those get consistently upvoted?

I did a cursory search and didn't come up with anything as broad reaching as what I wanted to say.)

I support marijuana legalization.  I see nothing wrong with the recreational use of pot.  I trust the credible evidence that marijuana has tangible benefits for medicinal purposes.  I'm sure the DEA is as awful as everyone says.  Mandatory minimum sentences are stupid.  I don't doubt that the strange banishment of the hemp industry in America has harmed the nation.  And so on, and so on.

Marijuana itself isn't my problem.  I'm here today to discuss marijuana's fan club.

Just like everyone else reading this, I have struggled with the overall lack of quality in most of reddit's popular communities.  This led me to trim down my subscriptions, so I'd only see a few smaller, topically focused subreddits.  For a while I was satisfied with this, but it got to be a bit boring due to the homogeneity of the posts; part of the appeal of reddit in the first place was being exposed to the highlights of topics I might not generally give a lot of thought and time.  As a result, I began to wander over to /r/all after I'd skim the stuff on my front page.

This gave me an opportunity to be annoyed once again with all of the usual suspects, such as /r/atheism and rage comics and shitty fake Facebook reposts and so on.  In total, though, I feel like I've spent more time shaking my head and sighing at the drivel that comes from /r/trees than anywhere else.

I suppose their trespasses are mostly overlooked because they're not offensive in a way that's particularly shocking or personal.  They're just a bunch of ""easy going"" stoners trying to have a good time, I guess.

But, holy shit, they are *bland*.

You know how people who have just discovered alcohol become pretty obnoxious?  Like, they send disjointed drunken text messages that basically amount to laughing at themselves for how hilarious it is that they're sooooo drunk?  And then the next day they talk about how they're soooo hung over because they were soooo drunk.  And then they talk about how they're going to get soooo drunk this weekend at this party they're going to where there's going to be soooo much alcohol and people are going to drink soooo much of it and get sooooo drunk.

Reasonable people grow out of this pretty quickly.  /r/trees, though, is overflowing with assholes who can't seem to get over this hump when it comes to smoking pot.

How many fucking anecdotes can these people share about how wacky and zany and ridiculous their perspective on the world becomes while high off their tits?  SO GUYS, THIS ONE TIME I WAS AT A SOLID [10] AND I DECIDED TO BUILD A FORT OUT OF COUCH CUSHIONS AND THEN MY NEIGHBOR KNOCKED ON MY DOOR AND I FREAKED THE FUCK OUT AND HID IN THE FORT AND STARTED JACKING OFF OUT OF FEAR.  Fuck you!  Who fucking cares.

You know what?  Actually, that story is so fucking hilarious, you better make a shitty rageface comic out of it.  And be sure to add bloodshot eyes to all of the faces, because you have to make it clear how fucking stoned you were.  Because, lol, you were sooooo fucking stoned.

Oh, by the way, I have to ask: how many slang terms can they possibly need for marijuana?  I can think of probably a dozen I see them use routinely just off the top of my head.  In fact, they have multiple overlapping slang terms for just about everything they do.  What's the point?  Maybe it stems (LOL MARIJUANA PUN) from the need to be discreet while talking about illegal drug usage or something, but I'm certain they only do this shit now because it's part of their not-so-secret club that makes them feel cool and special.  It's silly.

Just about every day there's a picture on /r/all of some pothead's unreasonably huge stash of marijuana.  Why is this interesting?  So, you have ten garbage bags filled with pot.  I guess you must be a dealer.  That's . . . nice.  Maybe they show this shit off so other stoners can privately contact them about buying some?  Isn't there a better way of doing this that doesn't pollute reddit?

Something else I don't get about these idiots is their obsession with drug paraphernalia.  A reasonable person would buy a bong or a bowl or a vaporizer or some rolling papers and get high and leave it at that.  But, no, these manchildren have to turn it into a fucking collection.  Have you seen the pictures of pot aficionados with dozens of enormous, ornate bongs?  Like, some of these guys have entire rooms filled with this ugly, tacky shit.  Everyone needs a hobby I guess, but holy fuck is this one stupid.  Worse yet, though, they often *name* their ""pieces.""  And the names are typically unsurprisingly uncreative.  MY EPIC FIVE FOOT LONG WATER PIPE IS ORANGE AND BLUE SO I NAMED HIM ""ORANGEY BLUEY.""  SAY HELLO, HE IS MY NEW BEST FRIEND.  Why can't these guys grow the fuck up?

I thought I'd have a lot more to rant about, but I just now realized that I've already covered nearly everything they talk about there.  Once in a while they'll have shitty myopic social and political discussions about marijuana, which are certainly a goldmine of material to discuss here, but that's beyond the scope of what I want to talk about right now.  At the moment I'm just pissed off about how fucking boring these people are.  I have no idea why, but this repetitive garbage routinely garners an excess of upvotes sufficient to send their collective ""culture"" rocketing to the top of the entirety of reddit.  How does this happen?  Why are so many people so fucking excited for the most dull aspects of weed?

I think that /r/books is one of the most shining example of how the reddit vote system, with an inexistent moderation, fails.

[People of Reddit that work in an insane asylum, what is the craziest story you have?](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jzope/people_of_reddit_that_work_in_an_insane_asylum/)

The first red flag I should have gotten was the use of ""insane asylum"" in the title, instead of a more modern term, like mental hospital. ""Insane asylum"" just sounds archaic and vaguely offensive. It brings to mind images of a stereotypical horror movie asylum, with dangerous violent patients all behind bars, which is plainly untrue. But, yknow, maybe the OP couldn't think of the right word for it, or maybe they were just unaware, so I clicked away.

So, I thought to myself as my page loaded, what kind of stories await me here? Touching stories of recovery? Chilling stories that convey the depth and seriousness of mental illness? 

Lol, no.

The [top](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jzope/people_of_reddit_that_work_in_an_insane_asylum/cbk0k05) comment is okay at first glance, but [further down](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jzope/people_of_reddit_that_work_in_an_insane_asylum/cbk5826) several people [point out] (http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jzope/people_of_reddit_that_work_in_an_insane_asylum/cbk8ozz) that there are some major holes in the story, if it's true at all. Maybe it's just me but it seems like the poster was possibly kind of playing into the ""insane asylum"" stereotype I mentioned before?

The [second](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jzope/people_of_reddit_that_work_in_an_insane_asylum/cbjv7x8) is where it really starts to go downhill.

&gt; My first day on the job I met a 400 pound woman who gave me the most innocent, childlike smile I have ever seen. She then proceeded to scratch between her behemoth bosoms and produced a chicken leg. She finished that in two bites and while I'm stammering to ask what I just saw she reaches between her legs and pulls out a chicken wing from her hoochie snapper and ate it. I found out from staff the last time they had chicken was a week ago.

+1124, -227

This is the most tailored-to-reddit story I've read in ages, especially one that was this heavily upvoted. It has everything. Somehow I find it hard to believe its coincidental one the top comments in this thread involves someone who embodies a lot of what reddit loves to hate, a  mentally ill fat woman. Plus, there's the fact that its got a more-than-striking resemblance to the ""Doritos story"", which the [top reply](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jzope/people_of_reddit_that_work_in_an_insane_asylum/cbjvrw7) points out.

I'm not saying this story isn't true, though I'm sure it's been embellished. What I'm saying is it's disgusting to me that if it is true, instead of taking to heart the sadness of what mental illness can reduce people to, the person who witnessed it in action decided to turn it into a sideshow attraction of a paragraph and post it on a website for the entertainment of complete strangers, who then proceeded to speculate what kind of noise the chicken made when it was pulled out of her bodily crevices.

Finally, the [third comment from the top](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jzope/people_of_reddit_that_work_in_an_insane_asylum/cbjya1l) puts into words what I had  been thinking, much more eloquently than I have.

&gt; This thread can't reasonably get any honest responses due to the stringency of confidentiality laws. Even if you don't disclose names and places it's still frowned upon to discuss such things, and honestly it's unprofessional. I've spent 4 accumulative years in psychiatric wards and treatment centers as a patient (for depression, defiance issues, etc) and I could tell a lot of stories but ultimately the most important thing to remember is that these are real people with real health issues and their behavior, while perhaps disturbing, isn't for your entertainment. So while I'm not going to pass any judgment on the posters of this thread, I really do urge you all to consider the seriousness of mental illness, and the legitimacy of worth a human life has, even if it's a bit damaged.

To be fair, there are still a lot of commenters agreeing with the need to be respectful when you're reading through the thread.

&gt; Japanese electronics giant Panasonic will plead guilty to US government charges that the company conspired to fix prices in two major markets: laptop battery packs and auto parts. Panasonic has agreed to pay $56.5 million in total fines for the two separate conspiracies and 15 executives at several companies will be serving jail time as part of the deal, the Justice Department announced last week. When it comes to the auto parts portion of the conspiracy, Panasonic's price-fixing is reported to have gone back at least 15 years, to 1998.

The title is [""TIL in 2011 German Police fired 85 bullets all year while US Police used 90 on one single person.""](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1hcxe2/til_in_2011_german_police_fired_85_bullets_all/)

I know you're all just itching to read the well thought-out and reasonable comments. 

&gt;Germans are efficient. +1435

This comment isn't SO bad. I'm just sick of the top comment always being a ""witty"" one-liner. 

&gt;Reporter: ""Officer, why did you fire 90 bullets at the suspect?"" Officer: ""That's all we had with us."" +992

Ha ha ha, get it? American cops kill everyone.

&gt;German police officer here. Feel free to ask.
Cops in Germany and Europe overall are much better trained than their US counterparts. If I'm informed correctly, the longest police training you can get in the US lasts about 6 months and the requirements are pretty low. In Germany it is at least a two and half years apprenticeship or a 3 years bachelors degree.
IMO there are a lot of reasons for this difference of gun usage. But a major point to me seems that US Cops are often very poorly trained and lack a certain amount of intelligence when it comes to talking to people. +333

Leave it to the German ""cop"" to tell everyone how bad American cops are. Thank fuck he recanted when confronted with the fact that he was absolutely wrong. 

&gt;Just two days ago, a Berlin policeman shot a naked stranger attacking him with a knife in public.
The event has caused a huge debate on whether it was neccessary to kill the attacker. Everytime something like this happens, the entire country immediately knows about because it's actually that rare.
But of course, carrying guns is important to society, government bad, evil European socialism yada yada. Also, ""Obamacare"". +208

I hate when people put up facts about an event and then try to sneak in their own opinion as if they've already got the world figured out. We get it, you're a misunderstood genius. I'll have a whopper, please. 

&gt;All that tells me is that all those american cops are thinking of is shooting 'bad guys', and they can't wait for the opportunity to do so. And when the slightest opportunity arises they overcompensate so heavily it's disturbing. +63

So that's what that tells you, huh? Please give me more of your expert insight on the topic. 

There's a ton more crap in that thread, all along the same lines of, ""fuck America, fuck cops, go Europe."" These opinions wouldn't be so infuriating if it wasn't so obvious that these people had next to no life experience. You can't criticize a country or it's cops because of an internet video you saw once. Of course lack of expertise has never stopped anyone from being an expert on this website. I hate you all.

I'm sure reddit will express their condolences.,_cryophile,254,71,153,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1dts92/justin_bieber_gets_assaulted_im_sure_reddit_will/,"Oh haha wait no of course they won't. Justin**e** Bieber makes music that doesn't fit their target demographic, so he (more like 'she'!!! ahahaha never gets old) deserves physical violence.

So apparently at his concert in Dubai, Justin ""Literally Hitler"" Bieber was [assaulted onstage](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1drck2/justin_bieber_assulted_at_dubai_concert/). Upon later investigation it appears that it was really just an overzealous fan, but it's not clear from the video. All you can tell is that someone is attacking Bieber and shit is falling over and it's probably scary and confusing for the people in the audience.

However, the enlightened denizens of /r/videos know better:

&gt;Hearing the girl freak out made that video so much funnier to me.

I guess I don't get the joke, but ok.

&gt;""I'll save you with my screams of general confusion""

Yep that's right, they're mocking someone for screaming when they witness an assault. A redditor would have watched in cool, stony, brave silence.

&gt;O MY GOD JUSTIN ARE YOU OK!?!?! fuckin retards

&gt;JUSTIN!! OH my god ARE YOU OK JUSTIN?AHHHH

&gt;This video reminds me why I hate teenage girls.

&gt;That genuine fear in her voice... it causes me to genuinely laugh out loud.

I'm gonna stop with the examples now, because 1/3 of the comments are basically this; belittling Justin's fans for being scared and upset as   he is assaulted.

The next 1/3 are hi[le]rious jokes of the highest caliber:

&gt;so they do not take kindly to women singers over there?

ohoho, please stop, my sides!!

&gt;NO! LEAVE HER ALONE! SHE'S JUST A LITTLE GIRL!

I don't even know what to say. This is the deadest of dead horses. At 53 upvotes, mind you.

&gt;I feel kinda terrible about it to be honest, I mean, honestly, think of what its been through, ya know? Literally so much pressure, I know I couldnt take it. Let's just hope no injuries were be had.
In short,
Recover Quickly Mr. Piano, we're all thinking about you.

""Ahaha, that's right, you thought that I cared about the actual human! Lol Justin's not a human."" This gem courtesy of OP himself.

All the other jokes are just versions of ""Oh no, i hope the piano didn't get hurt!"", I kid you not, it is just this over and over and over:

&gt;hope the piano is ok



And the last 1/3 of the comments are outright expressions of outrage that Bieber dares to not only exist, but be a musician.

&gt;what a little douche fucker, who gives money to this kid

&gt;How much does it cost to watch an ""artist"" pretend to play his music?

&gt;Fuck him anyway, little bitch.

&gt;This pleases me greatly.

&gt;Where do I send my money for that guy's legal defense fund?

And finally, a little something extra for the road: People who don't understand that security's job is to immediately eliminate any threat:

&gt;It was obviously a fan who was being a dumbass and wanted to hug him. The security guy went overboard and practically destroyed the entire set just to tackle the guy. He didn't need to take out JB AND the piano just to tackle the guy.

He did, actually. For all he knew that guy had a gun. His job is to make sure no one gets hurt. To do that he has to act immediately.

Of course, the great people of /r/videos wouldn't have bothered trying to save him, since they believe that Bieber deserves assault and possibly death, for the mere crime of not making music they like.

And then I made the grave mistake of looking at the comments.

It started off reasonably enough:
&gt;The United States used the Soviet Union as an anti-ideal, what we were not, and without that anti-model, we've lost our way.

A fair perspective to hold.  Let's check out the replies:

&gt;Look at capitalism in the 19th and early 20th centuries, even without slavery you get pictures of chimneysweeps dying of asthma, children working in the coal mines, the Irish being treated like scum etc. Things started improving right around the time the rich and powerful became genuinely concerned about that whole ""worldwide revolution"" thing the USSR was trying to export.
Now that it collapsed and communism is seen as a joke rather than as a valid counter-ideology to capitalism we'll be seeing (and are seeing) a natural regression back to low standards of living.

The only reason that The Man allowed your lives to improve during the 20th century was because communism.

&gt;the Scandinavian model being the obvious counter-example here, social democracy and all.

Obligatory S[weed]en comparsion.

&gt;I agree that things have gotten worse, but the US was never ""a bastion of freedom and a beacon of light"" to anyone but Americans. It's a myth that exists only inside these borders.

Why did my ancestors from Norway even bother coming here in the first place?  They already lived in paradise!

Now it's time to kick the jerk into high gear:

&gt;One time I asked a Russian friend, half jokingly, ""Aren't you glad America won the Cold War?""
She replied, ""You think you won the Cold War?!"" Dead serious.

And then this BRAVE reply:

&gt;Because most Russians understand that noone won. Both sides spend tens of trillions of dollars on pointless military hardware, burning up precious resources and oil that we'll never get back for nothing, nothing ever happened.
Think if that money had been spent on healthcare or medicine research, or education, or space exploration.
Both America and Russia lost the cold war. The cold war itself was losing.

So the Soviet Union collapsed and America became the world's sole superpower after the Cold War.  But America totally did not win, that's just a lie!

&gt;This is common knowledge. USSR was never as powerful as they were portrayed. It was nothing but American propaganda.

Even if America did win the Cold War, it was only because the Soviet Union was just a small, weak country with 6,000 nukes.  America was the real bully here.

&gt;History tells us nothing on the planet advances science like war does, and the Cold War was perfect in that regard. We got all the fruits and rewards of the ""war research"", and at the same time no one had to die for it. The perfect war really, we leaped forward in technology and didn't have to pay the price in the blood of millions.

1355802017.0,185,self.circlebroke,15172x,Reddit shows itself to be woefully uneducated about home education.,TwirlOfLemongrab,234,49,207,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/15172x/reddit_shows_itself_to_be_woefully_uneducated/,"Let me preface this by saying, yes, I was homeschooled. I am 21, about to start my last semester of college, will be graduating on time(rare for my major), and I attribute my success to my mother's choice of homeschooling me. I will not subject you to any more about me, here, but I will gladly answer any questions.

The [post](http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14zxk4/i_homeschool_my_children_i_didnt_think_this_was/) itself gives the reader some indication of how this will go, but it really does not do justice to the uneducated assumptions that appear in the replies.

The first big surprise comes with the [third](http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14zxk4/i_homeschool_my_children_i_didnt_think_this_was/c7hzodc) of the top comments.

&gt;[Are you not worried about them developing socially?](http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14zxk4/i_homeschool_my_children_i_didnt_think_this_was/c7hzodc)

The concept of a homeschooler with *friends* is too foreign for some people. The kicker? When multiples replies come, coupled with downvotes, explaining how this is a misguided assumption and relating personal experiences to the contrary, the poster gets upset.

&gt;[Jesus Christ people, I was asking a question. I don't give a fuck about your social skills and I have no doubt because you were homeschooled you had an advantage. Seriously hit some nerve on home schooled kids who still carry some sort of spite into their real world job. Not exactly doing anything for that stereotype with your responses, though.](http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14zxk4/i_homeschool_my_children_i_didnt_think_this_was/c7hzodc) 

How dare someone want to clarify that homeschooled children actually do get social interaction!? This poster wanted the OP to affirm his assumption of inadequate social interaction.

&gt;[So why is it best for your children to be homeschooled? It seems like you're doing a great job with what you're teaching them, but does that really outweigh socializing them?](http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14zxk4/i_homeschool_my_children_i_didnt_think_this_was/c7i0ra8)

Homeschooler is equated with social outcast, in this redditors mind.

Another misguided assumption seen throughout the replies is that religion is the main factor for most people in homeschooling their children.

&gt;[Do you teach any religious study, why/why not?](http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14zxk4/i_homeschool_my_children_i_didnt_think_this_was/c7hzhr4)

The first of many.

&gt;[all the home schooled people I know were kept home for religious reason, which helps explains the holes in their education.](http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14zxk4/i_homeschool_my_children_i_didnt_think_this_was/c7i0huj)

Because being religious and having a good education are mutually exclusive.

&gt;[I think often and historically many parents homeschool to indoctrinate their children with religion without outside influence,](http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14zxk4/i_homeschool_my_children_i_didnt_think_this_was/c7i2tj9)

To this redditors defense, they do give a personal account of their homeschooled cousins who are socially normal.

Then, there's the matter of general misinformation about homeschoolers, homeschool practices, and how homeschooling works.

&gt;[Public schools have all kinds of standards they have to meet. Home schooling, at least to my knowledge, doesn't have those same requirements.](http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14zxk4/i_homeschool_my_children_i_didnt_think_this_was/c7i11f4)

A simple google search could show anyone that homeschooled children DO have to pass state certified, standardized testing. Personally, I looked forward to it every year, because I scored well and it helped my self esteem.

&gt;[what worries me about the education side of home schooling is that many who home school aren't teachers and I don't believe they have the ability to teach as well as the average teacher.](http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14zxk4/i_homeschool_my_children_i_didnt_think_this_was/c7i0ako)

There is an ample amount of curriculum out there offered by reputable publishers that aids parents greatly, not to mention classes offered by co-ops and other homeschooler parents who understand the material better. I've been exposed to both, and I think my high ACT score is proof enough as to how effective they are.

&gt;[What if your children wanted to go to public school?](http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14zxk4/i_homeschool_my_children_i_didnt_think_this_was/c7i0qrr)

This is by far my favorite reply, due to how much it pains me to think that someone would even post such an asinine question. The OP of the thread is the parent, and it is her decision, not the children's, as to how they shall be educated.

Fear not, circlebroke, for some replies show that there are still intelligent redditors out there.

&gt; [It's not like throwing kids into school automatically makes them socially adept.](http://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14zxk4/i_homeschool_my_children_i_didnt_think_this_was/c7i1g21)

The bottom line, right here. School and the ability to socialize are NOT synonymous.

Recently, Lil Wayne, despite being one of the pioneers of modern rap music, having more hit singles than Elvis Presley, and going platinum 6 times from 1999-2008, has endured criticism recently because he hasn't been putting out good music. He created a standard for himself and hasn't been living up to it. 

/r/music's hatred of rap that isn't Mack[le]more or Immortal Technique's ""Dance With The Devil"" isn't exactly a secret, in fact, not very many people on reddit in general are not fans of rap music. To each their own, and all that, but when it comes to Weezy (Lil Wayne), reddit has a less than tolerant opinion. The musical jerk surrounding him is second only to the anti-bieber jerk, followed in 3rd by the sarcastic posting of 2 Chainz lyrics ""she got a big booty so I call her big booty"" on every single thread about lyrics ever.

Let's get to the [thread](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1adr6r/lil_wayne_in_critical_condition_after_more/) in question.


&gt;Guess we can stop calling him Lil' Weezy and
puts on sunglasses
start calling him Lil' Seizey

PUN THREAD LELELELE

&gt;New Harlem Shake video? ... No?

Look how funny I am guys!

&gt;HAHA I don't mean to be a dick but that's what a lot of codeine does. these fucking rappers think its awesome. it makes you feel great but turns you into a zombie.

DAE think drugs are bad? Druggies never make good musicians guys! Let's forget about the Beatles, Hendrix, and just about every major band from the 60's-80's!

&gt; think /r/music currently hates on him, but Macklemore puts it pretty well:
Syrup, Percocet, and an eighth a day will leave you broke, depressed, and emotionally vacant
Despite how Lil Wayne lives
It's not conducive to being creative
And I know 'cause he's my favorite
And I know 'cause I was off that same mix
Rationalize the shit that I'd try after I listen to dedication
But he's an alien, I'd sip that shit, pass out or play Playstation
Looks like he's human after all.

Holy fuck this song is seriously in like 7 comments. DAE HIP HOP/RAP SAVIOUR MACK[LE]MORE HAS A SONG FOR EVERY OCCASION?!?!

&gt;And that's why you always leave a note

Because of course there's an Arrested Development joke.

&gt;Oh god, I dread seeing lil wayne immortalized as one of rap's ""greatest ever,"" simply because he died young.

Wether you like it or not, Wayne went platinum 6 times and I believe one of those he went double platinum on. He was a pioneer for the genre in the early 2000's, and is considered one of the best rap artists of that time. BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS BECAUSE HE SAID SWAG ONCE, and I don't like rap because it scares me.

To their credit, there are lots of people calling the shitty posters of the thread out, but that doesn't mean there still aren't 20-30 posters saying some variations of ""good I hope he dies"" in the comments. For a place that prides itself on being the epitome of humanity, reddit really doesn't give a shit about people they don't like, regardless of logic or the past.

Sorry if this sucks, I'm pretty pissed at this whole thing right now

[This link](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/11n36a/8000yrold_carvings_in_stone_destroyed_in_moroccos/) in r/worldnews alleged that Muslims in Morocco destroyed some ancient artifact that no one in the thread even knew existed until they were given a chance to be outraged over it. 

The post garnered almost 3,000 net upvotes and almost all of the comments espouse explicit anti-Islam sentiment. But not just ho-hum Islamophobia - no, ""literally Hitler"" calls for outright genocide. Now, when I was in the heat of this submission, the ""best"" comments were a lot worse than they are now - they seem to have been slightly moderated over the past weeks. But you don't have to look hard to find the most outrageous, intolerant, misguided anti-Islam sentiment I think I've ever heard, and I've been on some pretty intolerant websites. In fact, sorted by ""top,"" the intolerance is still pretty clear. Comments like: 

&gt;For me this goes way beyond lament. These people need to be hunted down like the filthy pigs they are. This isn't even about religion, it's about a culture of hatred for humanity itself and the things we cherish. It doesn't matter why anymore, they are crossing lines that cannot ever be uncrossed.

But [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/11n36a/8000yrold_carvings_in_stone_destroyed_in_moroccos/c6nxfh5) fucking guy really takes the cake. He actually says, ""I don't normally advocate violence, but these particular type of Muslims? Fucking wipe them off the face of the earth. Do it now."" This guy got me so riled up I took the time to argue against him, but of course I was downvoted and did not receive a single response that agreed with me (although one guy did PM me saying he appreciated my efforts.)

Of course, over time, all these comments have been tempered. Edits have been made and many have even been deleted. But the sentiments are still there, the messages have already been made and agreed with, the hatred has been propagated, their karma is still through the roof, and, for a long time, when this post actually mattered and people read it, these people were being *worshipped* for expressing their hate and bloodlust against some other kind of worshipper.

Fortunately, one user just happened to be a [""specialist""](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/11n36a/8000yrold_carvings_in_stone_destroyed_in_moroccos/c6o3n2h), and he had been in personal contact with someone relevant, so the whole thing must be true and everything is verified, we have a right to call for the murder of these people. Trust him, the locals are *pissed.* Trust him, he's a *specialist.*

So here's where things really get interesting. Not only did Reddit display its true colors without even the mere suggestion that they should verify themselves (and had ""specialists"" on hand to re-assure us that the ""locals were pissed""), but they did so over something that was 100% **bulllshit**.  4 days later, it ""broke"" that [the original story never happened.](https://pay.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/11uj5o/morocco_denies_destruction_by_salafi_muslims_of/) Of course, this revision only receives about 120 net upvotes, and has a small fraction of the comment base. Most of the comments here are pointing out how absurd it was that Reddit jumped on this issue in the first place, and the comments doing so in the original post have since been significantly upvoted. But, as someone in the second post commented, the damage has already been done. And it was done *severely.* I was legitimately worried about the future of the Western population that they could succumb so quickly, severely, and happily to the media bias against Muslims, going so far as to call for the extermination of a culture. All over something that **didn't even happen.** It was like the scary anti-Islam bias after 9/11, except over a decade later and without any semblance of validity. It wasn't even human lives the alleged Salafists attacked - it was objects, idols of the past - yet Redditors called for the lives of these Salafists, their heads on a stake. 

It is no wonder that McCarthyism was so successful in the 20th century. People are *easy* to manipulate. Even the liberal, progressive, Atheist scientist specialists of Reddit. 

Know who else gets offended by things that allegedly happened halfway across the world that have absolutely no impact on they themselves, things that actually never even happened yet induce dramatic, knee-jerk emotional responses calling for the destruction of the offenders at all costs? Fucking terrorists. Know who else calls for the extermination of a religion they do not agree with?

I'm torn here - on one hand, I can't help but think this is a r/circlejerk or r/magicskyfairy troll raid.  On the other, it could be 99% bullshit a la the Wal-Mart/Mountain Dew affair from a user desperate for karma.  If u/ricky_gervatheist posted it, I'd be willing to bet they'd upvote it anyways.  

&gt; I fell in love with Carl Sagan (almost literally ;) and gobbled up Cosmos like a hungry child.

That's a particularly great quote in the OP's story - not only does it make a play on his homosexuality, he's making sure everyone know's he worships (pun intended) their god, Carl Sagan.  At least he knows how to fit into the crowd nicely.  

&gt; As Harris said - If I could get rid of rape or Religion, I would get rid of Religion. Religion is Worse than Rape, as it motivates rape and countless other attrocities.

Another saint of atheism - Sam Harris.  The OP is firing on all cylinders now.  If only mentions ""The God Delus...

&gt; Anyways after the week of constant teasing at School, I looked at Barnes and Noble at the mall, and saw a display for a book called 'The God Delusion'. This wasn't hidden away in the back like some sort of contraband. In the midst of the theocracy that is my state, we had it on a shelf advertising it loud and proud. I had never seen such blatant disrespect to God, and was in awe of such blatant disregard for Religion.

OP didn't disappoint...

As you can imagine, the comments in that cesspool are just as entertaining as the OP's story.  Let's check out a choice few, shall we?

Occasionally, it happens that a herd of glossy-coated Redditors, grazing quietly by a pool of logic and reasoned debate, will be surprised by the fearsome spectre, rising scaly-coated from the depths, of an opinion they disagree with.

See then the herd react in startled fear, scrambling back from the waterside! Hear then the hooting in confused alarm, as Redditors form a tight knot of bodies, sleek-spined antlers outwards to ward off any threat! 

Eventually, the wise patriarch, longtime guardian of this panicked flock, steps forward and lays their fears to rest. This crocodile of difference, this dreadful predator, is nothing to be feared - it is not *really* a differing opinion, but merely a ""shill"".

Emboldened by the knowledge that they don't have to question their worldview, the noble creatures savagely hoof the offending remark to death.

""What is a shill?"", I hear no one ask, but should probably explain for completeness. A shill is one who takes money to spread opinions, or is sent by dark and secret interests to spread duplicitous viewpoints. Unlike ""real"" Redditors, who have no prior opinions or agenda about anything, a shill seeks to pervert discussion by lies and tricks. When seeking to dismiss opinions that on disagrees with, it is sufficient to term them ""shillery"" or ""psyops"" or ""Jew lies (why does it make me anti-semitic to criticize Israel?)"", and then they can be ignored. If something might be shillery, you don't really need to engage with its arguments, you just need to yell at it. This is exactly how discussion works.

This is a frequent occurence - whether it is a lone dissenting voice in the stampede, or perhaps a single Redditor blunders into a thicket where others do not generally agree with his opinion, accusations of shillery fly thick and fast - witness [this subthread](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/14pymy/julian_assange_to_form_wikileaks_party_run_for/c7ff63i), in which various staunch Redditors agree that literally the only reason someone might have a different conception of the whole Assange situation than they do is because the US government and the New York Times are paying them to express such lies. 

[Or this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/13js68/holocaust_survivor_suzanne_weiss_on_gaza/c74o1bk), in which we learn that the only way posts even slightly critical of Israel survive on Reddit is because the vast hordes of Jewry are currently sleeping (it is interesting to note that that thread was made last month - one would assume that all those downvoting Israelis would have woken up by now).

[Or this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/14rdgj/anne_hathaway_flips_an_inappropriate_question_by/c7fv8xt), which teaches us that not only is someone a corporate shill, but that evil corporations, for some reason, are massively involved in the business of upskirt shots. 

If you wish more information on the horde of cheats and liars swarming all over Reddit, might I direct you to /r/shill, where noble Redditors work tirelessly with the agenda of identifying and stopping those who act on Reddit with an agenda.

Further examples are there for the finding, but I am rather lazy, and so shall take unfair advantage of today being Friday. Seek and ye shall find. If you don't find examples to support my point, that is almost certainly because you work for Big Pharma.

I myself have, at various times, been accused of shilling for the US government (which is odd, as I still think that the US revolution should have ended differently), Israel, both SRS and anti-SRS (likewise /r/feminisms and r/mensrights), the Man, all bankers ever, the mortal avatar of Wall Street, radical socialist groups, the MPAA/RIAA/Other hard to remember acronyms, fundamentalist Islam/Christianity/Scientology, the Elder God Tzeentch, and the abstract concept of shame. I have, presumably, shilled sea-shills on the shill-shore.

Such accusations are everywhere, on every side, and normally upvoted, despite their detractors (who are often also shills! We would really be in a pickle if various Redditors were not so amazing at exposing the truth.) - the first link provided has numerous comments calling it out, and yet still it rises. 

There are, as I see it, two problems with this:

1. it is injurious to debate, if one side simply shouts ""Shill! I shall not listen!"" when faced with disagreement; conversations that should take place, and would interest me, don't. Dissenting opinions, when they appear, are always prefaced -  ""As a Republican who voted for Obama"", ""I'm not saying I agree with it"", ""Racism is fine, obviously, but..."". If every negative must be qualified or silenced, nothing actually happens but affirmation of the majority opinion, even when it is idiocy.

2. It is indicative of an incredibly gullible, unreasonable tendency within Reddit - anything that disagrees with the prevailing narrative must be lies spread by Dark Riders, and that assertion needs no proof. In fact, asking for proof of it is evidence that the asker is themselves a shill. 

The aggregate opinion of this many people shouldn't be this stupid, shouldn't be this biased, and shouldn't be this paranoid. In defiance of all reason, supported by a lack of evidence, the accusers silence and sideline disagreement, and this is one of the many factors which contributes to the dearth of discussion, particularly on the larger subreddits.

Who are these people, and how do they function, if they genuinely that it is impossible for anyone to actually disagree with them? If they think that the only reason for anyone not showring them with praise must be that cartoonishly villanous capitalists are paying them not to? Who is so dense that they find it more likely that shadowy forces track their every asinine utterance than that someone, in passing, identified the cause and nature of their manifest idiocy? 

Who is so entitled, ignorant and arrogant that they think like this? How can they be stopped?

On the other hand, what do I know? Disregard this entire screed, I'm almost certainly just saying it all because the powerful and radical pro-shill lobby pays me to.

Yes, gay people shouldn't get offended because it's the internet, ya know? YOLO! If I want to call someone a faggoty fag fag, I'm going to!

&gt;It doesnt mean gay anymore

...

&gt;I hope you realize 90% of people who say that don't even associate the word with homosexualism

...

&gt;Where have you been? Faggot no longer is slandering gay men. It never started as one and it shouldn't have ever become one. Faggot is constantly changing meanings

...

&gt;Do people use ""faggot"" as a non-derogatory word? Is ""faggot"" usually used as a way to refer to themselves as a homosexual? If anything, the word ""faggot"" has somewhat lost meaning, in the sense that ""fuck"" has, kinda.

...

&gt;I feel like this is one of those words that has been turned into a synonym for 'asshole' or 'douche'...not justifying nor saying it's not offensive to homosexuals but I think it's become an every day word for most people. South Park showed how it's used best in our society..I try my best to refrain from using it because you never know who might take offense to it...Im sorry for people offending you and I hope you don't let it affect you because, in all honesty, the majority of people aren't saying it to belittle gay people.

YOU GUISE! FAGGOT ISN'T OFFENSIVE ANYMORE, WORDS CHANGE, STOP BEING OFFENDED. FOR FUCK'S SAKE, SOUTHPARK HAD AN EPISODE ABOUT IT! IT'S OKAY NOW, IT'S GO THE GREEN LIGHT!

&gt;Sorry if I offended. Not meant to mean ""gay"". If you want to remove the stigma of a word, you need to start using it. That's the only way to remove the association with gays. Just look what happened to the word ""nigga"". I just meant OP was being a faggot you know, for the karma.

/facepalm -- That's not the derogatory form of the word! ugh. And yeah, using a different form of the word among yourselves certainly makes the word okay to use by everyone else. Me and my white friends use it all the time! (As long as black people aren't around...don't want to be awkward)

&gt;Check out Louis C.K.'s bit about that. Might make you feel better. Or not.

...

&gt;Have you seen Louis C.K.'s bit about that? It's pretty hilarious and aptly describes how most of reddit uses he word faggot.

Ah Louis C.K. Of course! His word is gospel! DAE watch Louis?!?! The straight, popular, very funny comedian says it's okay, so...it's okay!

&gt;For some reason I doubt your claim. I've known many gay men and none of them were ever offended by the use of the word faggot. In fact they would often use it their selves.

You doubt that someone is offended by the use of the word faggot? Because anecdotal evidence says gay people aren't! All 1 of my gay friends aren't offended, so you can't be!

Some gay people probably aren't offended by it. But not all gay people find it inoffensive.

&gt;Straight guy, doesn't bother me when people use straight as an insult. Do you really think that he was saying that the OP was gay, or do you think he was saying that the OP was a loser for claiming his mom took this picture. You can be gay all you want, but don't be a faggot, man.

Straight...as an insult?

""Did you see Andy last night, dude was soooo straiiiiiight. Not cool."" I can't even picture a gay person trying to use it as an insult.

Who tries to defend their use of the word faggot?

""It's our word now homosexuals, and you can't have it back! No more being offended, or else will use it on you!""

If you're going to have to use a word to insult someone, but the insult has ""nothing to do with them being gay"", just use a different word that doesn't have a fucking history of being insulting to a particular section of people.

One man decideds to do a pic by pic swearathon recipe for shitty chili. ""Don't get a spice packet, buy every individual spice and make the same exact packet to add to your chili."" Reddit loved this because it was so high energy.

Then came the fabled [Ice Soap](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jinex/shower_to_go/). I never saw the original post until much later. The trend continued around the same time as 2AM Chili and the memes poured out everywhere.

&gt;I dont get it...

yes, yes, you're a regular Shuckey Duckey. This then leads to explanations that all feel the need to emphasize how pompous it is to feel like one gains something from reading.

&gt;Basically, some people like to think they are better, smarter or more insightful because they read books.
The one who has the knowledge from the books can see over the wall and his vision is not blocked by the wall.
None of it really matters. Enjoy your life.

Sitting at +62. None of this is suggested in the original pic except the bit about the guy looking over the wall. They felt the need to bolster their point with a weird bit of nihilism which makes it sound like someone had a hard time in AP english.

Then comes this bit of insight.

&gt;Honestly I don't believe the picture refers to reading in general as much as it refers to education.
Reading on it's own won't do much for you except for maybe improving your grammar... Reading 50 shades of gray or Lord of the Rings will hardly help you in life.

First of all, why are reading and education necessarily exclusive to one another. Only in the mind of an extremely lame, uncreative indivdual could I see this being true as many books offer more than just tips on grammar...This almost seems like a mini conservative (in the material sense) jerk where only activities that lead to material gain are worth your time. It's not like being a well-rounded individual with a broad reference pool with which to better understand and interface with the world is important or anything.

Then comes a voice of reason.

&gt;I beg to differ. Every single book I've read made me a different person. Even those for recreational reading but especially autobiographical literature.

Ah, here we go. A person who enjoys a good read and takes away a bit of *perspective* from the books they flip through. They could probably hold a conversation that didn't hinge on video game knowledge and may-mays. Sitting at +1 after being up and downvoted enough to make that happen.

&gt;That's bullshit, for the sake of trying to sound philosophical.

That's reasonable +2.

&gt;Right. I've known avid readers who were ignorant imbeciles, and I've known scarce readers who were brilliant and knowledgeable. Reading fiction for pleasure is mere entertainment. It is a misconception to think that reading Harry Potter (or whatever) distinguishes you intellectually from anyone. If you control for education, intelligence, etc., there is no intellectual distinction between those who read and those who do not.
(I of course presume we are discussing recreational reading, as that is the hobby from which most people develop their elitist attitudes - when we discuss ""reading books,"" few people are talking about their predilection for reading textbooks or manuals or academic publications or the news or Wikipedia).

This is so full of holes I'll just leave it up to you. At least it was kept at +1. It's really indicitive of lazy behavior being passed off as something that's been meditated on tirelessy. We get it you don't like to read. Perhaps you find it boring but that's more of a personal problem so denigrating the whole field of fiction [(and the very act of reading) le glorious STEM major, amirite?] just makes you look dumb.

Looking back, this may not seem like a big deal but I really take offense to people pulling this kind of shit. Writing and reading is yet another form communication that has arguably enriched humanity as a whole for the better and one can of course learn things in books that they take with them through life, it's all subjective anyway. But since communication is basically a social activity, we can't expect reddit to 'get it' now can we?

Naturally, I was intrigued, but a bit of poking around the [New York Times website](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/01/world/europe/police-attack-protesters-in-istanbuls-taksim-square.html?ref=europe&amp;_r=0) showed that the title was hyperbole, at best ([Reuters](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/05/31/uk-turkey-protests-idUKBRE94U0JA20130531) for those without a NTY sub.) Important, and definitely relevant news, but a sensationalist title.

Basically, there's been some protests over a planned development in Turkey. These have now escalated into a general airing of greivances about the (democratically elected) Turkish government. Now, eight hours later, let's see what we've got in /r/worldnews. These links are in the order that they're in on the /r/worldnews frontpage.

Now, what's the problem here? It's that of the highly-upvoted sources, none of them are reputable, the first reputable source being Al Jazeera. They're someone's facebook page, a Twitter, a Tumblr account. None of it is from an actual news organization. In the case of the iReport, it's all unsourced claims (nothing better then a rumor,) with 2000 upvotes. The tweet is the same deal. The Facebook and Tumblr aren't quite so bad, but they're social media, not actual journalism. To be fair, there's information from decent news organizations below these, but there are at the top.

This is merely an example of a problem that I've seen running rampant in /r/worldnews, especially recently. Highly sensationalist titles from extremely questionable sources are regularly highly upvoted. The problem here is obvious - someone's blog is not an accurate news source. People have used this to deliberately spread misinformation in the past. In the case of the iReport, it's mostly unverified rumors. It also shows /r/worldnews' love of sensationalism.

In addition, information from social media (not from reputable news organizations,) is regularly highly upvoted. This isn't quite so bad (and can even be good,) but it can still be very problematic. First, there's no one checking that the information is true. Mainstream media have a reputation to uphold, a random guy on Facebook does not. In the case of pictures and videos, there's no context. Now, there's *definitely* a place for this, but you've got to be very careful when trusting information you find on Faecbook.

This problem is by no means unique to what's happening today. /r/worldnews loves sensationalism, and these dubious sources from social media bring that for them. There's nothing inherently wrong with citizen journalism, but unlike mainstream journalists, these 'journalists' have no reputation to uphold. Mainstream journalists are careful not to deliberately report misinformation or speculation, as it would ruin their reputation. Citizen journalists do not have a reputation to uphold, so there's nothing stopping them from reporting misinformation, speculation and rumors. Probably the best example of this was the [great nuclear disaster coverup of 2012](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/uqlq9/reddit_i_think_there_is_a_giant_nuclear_coverup/). The problem is that these sources are highly upvoted, and there's absolutely nobody questioning them in the comments. This is a problem. 

There's also a problem that this can lead to the importance and consequences of a story being overblown by these citizen journalists. I'm not going to speculate about what'll happen to this story (we'll need hindsight for that.) 

Is this an important story? Definitely. But it's extremely problematic when a major source of information on /r/worldnews is people's blogs and Twitters.

To anyone who has been on reddit for less than a week, this would seem like a perfectly reasonable premise for conversation--a valid question even. However, we bitter many know better and enter the thread braced for an inevitable series of runaway wanks. 

Right off the bat, we get a totally unhelpful CJ that functions as a corollary to one of reddit's classics, the anti-children jerk. 

&gt;Children are seen as innocent, so as a society it's easier to make people care immensely what happens to them.

&gt;""Protecting the children"" is a phrase that shuts down debate immediately. Once there is a shred of doubt that a candidate wants to ""protect the children,"" that candidate has already lost. So nobody would ever vote against strengthening anti-child-predator laws, regardless of how strong they already are or whether such action would have any meaningful impact.

&gt;""Candidate X voted against harsher penalties for child rapists. Who is he trying to protect? Because it's not your children. Vote for Candidate Y.""

&gt;It's too easy.

&gt;Every year, all over the country, people invent the need to ""strengthen laws that protect the children."" There is no logical end.

[+2294]

There are a few glaring issues with this comment, which are all heinously compounded by its position at the very top of the heap. The first and most obvious is that it doesn't really answer the question, at least not in any direct sense, but has garnered enough support to rise above the masses. Beyond that, it begs a second question: were these laws really made (or not made) under the assumption that all victims of sexual crimes are children, and that all murdered souls are adults? I am sincerely confused as to why this, of all responses, is the most sensible to our enlightened masses here at /r/askreddit. 

From this first comment, the responsenses spin off into a predictable defense of predatory behavior and vicious CJ of how unfair life is for the convicted pedarest: 

&gt;This needs to be at the top. ""Think of the children"" politics are to blame for a system that is proven to be ineffective and in many cases unjust (if a 17 year old sleeps with an 18 year old the 18 year old's life can be ruined because of the registry, to use a common example).

&gt;As for legitimately dangerous offenders, the registry eliminates any chances of rehabilitation by turning them into an outcast after they've served their time.

&gt;The entire thing is a horrible system constructed because it's an easy, winning political platform.
[+1232]

Please note the reference to statutory rape, reddit's favorite not-crime crime, committed only by the helplessly sexy and batman. 

Let's get even more tangential in this thread with a critique of helicopter parents--that seems pertinenet: 

&gt;I also blame ""Think of the children"" politics for the current climate against letting kids actually go out and be kids. When you have to keep an eye on your kids 24/7 to not be considered an irresponsible parent, it becomes impossible to let your kids go out and play as kids should. Kids need to be allowed to do kid things, not be limited by constant over-caring.

[+702]

That thread spins out for quite a while in a number of different directions, none of which I have the energy to follow to their exhaustingly trite conclusions, so let's move on.

#2 top level comment is a hilariously brief, but to the point justification for the existence of a sex-offender list, but not a murderer list:

&gt;most murderers aren't repeat offenders
[+1623]

Although there is an obvious lack of...anything beyond this single unsupported sentence here, it has a certain logic to it. My standards are pretty low on askreddit, so I found myself mildly celebrating a point that I wasn't aware of a CJ surrounding at some point in the recent past. Don't worry, ladies and gentleman, this second comment thread gets derailed in short order by reddit's second favorite sex-offender-hero, the public urinator:

&gt;But why is it bad to have someonly live in your neighborhood who has probably just peed in public once?

[+279]

I pee in public like it is going out of style--when reading reddit I feel amazed that I have not made it onto America's Most Wanted for this behavior. 

Supporting this jerk is one of the blandest anecdotes regarding cops and urination that has ever been shared on teh internet: 

&gt;I didn't know how severe peeing in public was until a few years ago. When I was a senior in high school, I was waiting outside of my friends house and had to piss so unbelievably bad. I peed right next to a dumpster in a parking lot, which was not lit at all. As I was zipping up, a cop shined a light on me and we had a small exchange.

&gt;Cop: I'm going to have to take you in for peeing in public Me: I didn't pee in public Cop: I just saw you Me: No, I'm just waiting for my friend to come let me in Cop: Lying to me is just going to make it worse Me: Why would I lie to you about something so stupid? There are 8 inches of snow on the ground, you could just get out of the car and look, it wouldn't be hard to spot the yellow stained snow. Cop: ...okay, have a good evening, stay out of trouble

[+535]

And down this conversation spirals into brave new worlds of wasted breath. My top-thread glimmer of hope for something resembling an actual discussion has been snuffed out without prejudice. Goodnight, sweet prince and all that. Somewhere down the line,a few voices of contrary reasonableness are hovering around +100/+200 uptokes, but quoting them doesn't make me feel superior, so I'll gloss by it.

Anyway, I'm running out of energy for this post, and it does get *slightly* better as you go down, so I'll truncate here.

This post has currently 871 points and I personally think it’s beyond most things I have seen on reddit, and I have seen a lot. To start off, we have the typical overuse of fancy words to the point where it backfires. 'Agrarian peasants', wow really? For the rest, I don’t even know how to structure a text with all the things I have to complain about, so I make a short list instead:

  * **China was completely unchanged for thousands of years.** This is a term that is used way too much when Westerners shall describe a society that hasn’t had the same technological development as the European world. Assumptions are always made that the relatively slow technological improvement is a sign of a completely stagnant and in all aspects backwards society.

  * **Chinese people are less intelligent because those who were intelligent were executed.** The communist government did target academics and intellectuals, but does this mean that the genes for intelligence were removed? I think this is yet an example of the age-old perception that middle-class people are more intelligent than those from the lower classes, a subject we will return to later.

  * **China is STILL IN THE 20TH CENTURY!!!** Yet another childish example of the notion that the development of a society is measured along a one-dimensional scale where the development of the western world serves as some kind of SI unit.

  * **Chinese people have no sanity.** That’s basically what he says. I don’t even feel like commenting on that. And now for his wonderful analogy:
  * **What if someone killed everyone in the United States except the dumb ones (Southerners, of course. Who else?) and move them to *New York* (The world capital of refined culture)!!

1336913098.0,182,self.circlebroke,tkw9x,The piracy circlejerk,,217,35,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/tkw9x/the_piracy_circlejerk/,"Right, first off, before I say anything else, I'm aware that pretty much everyone in here, including myself, will have pirated something at some point. Very few people who are on the Internet and have a reasonable awareness of what BitTorrent is will not have done so. It's pretty much a given at this point. So before anyone says hypocrite... yeah, I know.

BUT. /r/technology's fucking bitching is insufferable at the moment. The way they go on, you'd think downloading every single thing you can get your hands on is a basic human right, that The Pirate Bay are brave warriors for freedom and that that Falkvinge nut is Nelson Mandela and Gandhi combined. I mean, what's on the front page now? ""Just arrived in Belgium from Canada... Is this seriously what Europe has come to?"" What is the poster referring to? The Pirate Bay being blocked. Yeah, because it's such a fucking travesty that you can't get movies or music. The way people go on you'd think they'd been banning political opposition speech (which is actually something these idiots think is next up, which is as great a slippery slope fallacy as I can think of).

Then there was that Game of Thrones thread. ""But I don't want to pay for cable..."" So don't watch the show or buy it on DVD when it comes out, or buy it from iTunes when it's released on there. You're not entitled to it for free because you don't want to pay for it. All of their arguments are basically that they like the product, but not enough to actually pay the going rate for it, so they're going to take it for free. Ugh.

But of course nobody wants to admit they just want free stuff. There's ridiculous arguments trotted out as to why they won't pay for things which cost money to make and distribute. ""It's the wrong codec"", ""it takes too long to release here"", ""I don't want a physical copy""... so why are you then entitled to get it for free? You're not, and they know they're not, but they just want to make themselves feel better about not paying for something that costs money. That's all, and it's transparent. Moreover, anyone who suggests that The Pirate Bay is not necessarily a universal force for good (in that they make money off of infringing others' copyrights) gets downvoted into oblivion. It's ridiculous.

Then you get the stupid quote from Gabe Newell, that piracy is a ""service issue"", followed inevitably by an assertion that what Steam does is somehow better than what the music industry does. I have asked, repeatedly, how Steam provides a better service than iTunes/Amazon MP3 and never got a proper reply beyond some waffling (strictly speaking, iTunes provides a *better* service, as there is no DRM whatsoever on iTunes downloads now or any requirement to use the iTunes application beyond actually downloading the music - Amazon MP3 doesn't even need an application to be installed). Spotify, too, provides limitless access to a wide variety of music ad-free for the price of one Steam game a month. How is that not fair? The industry are not perfect, but they are trying to accommodate the Internet while also trying to make money from what they make (as they have every right to) and time and time again pirates have shown relatively little interest in actually paying for the stuff they consume - they make demands like ""we want it DRM-free"" and ""we want it to be accessible everywhere"" and then when those are met they make up new ones and continue pirating. No compromise, just excuses.

But of course, while movie makers and musicians don't necessarily deserve to be compensated for their work and free distribution of it is good because of the ideal of a ""free culture"", if someone takes your shitty rage comic and reposts it on 9gag they're literally Hitler. I saw someone on /r/technology moaning about how some torrent site was ""stealing releases from the scene"" (releases, let me remind you, of other peoples' work) and marvelled at the irony and circular logic of people who spend their time ripping off others' hard work and distributing it freely complaining about their hard work in ripping off hard work being ripped off and distributed. Do they seriously not see the disconnect there?

And yes, the music industry is full of cunts. Yes, there have been some shitty things they and the movie industry have done. No, that does not in any way justify taking their products for free. Again, nobody can claim they're taking a high ground here, since virtually everyone has engaged in piracy, but stop claiming it's some sort of noble act, stop claiming you have a moral justification for it, stop claiming you want anything other than just free shit and finally stop fucking bitching when the people who actually invested money into making the stuff they're selling but you're taking for free catch wind of it and try to stop it. What else do you expect them to do? I hear talk of ""adjusting business models"" but the only business model I'm hearing suggested is one where bands make music and everyone else gets it free of charge, which is simply not fucking sustainable.

Due to the 'Always-On' DRM employed by the program, server capacity problems meant many people couldn't play when it was first released and although these issues have been largely resolved there are still numerous bugs.

Firstly, /r/simcity has experienced exponential growth in the past month - from around 9,000 subscribers in February to just under 24,000 today, and as you can imagine with this growth, there has been a significant influx of the anti-EA circlejerk. While previously the subreddit was sharing strategy, cities, hints and tips, all of a sudden it had become the latest source of ""EA is evil"".

Now, I'm not suggesting that this is entirely undeserved, but the level of vitriolic hate has grown so bad that Maxis representatives (previously very active on the site) [don't feel they can post any more](https://twitter.com/andrewwillmott/status/311950660964859905).

Anyway, the moderators decided today to [tackle the situation](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1ah51f/the_state_of_the_subreddit_and_how_were_going_to/) (+150) by banning memes, requiring posts concerning problems with the game post solutions, and prohibiting posts that just bash EA/Origin.

How does the community react? By calling bloody murder, of course!
&gt; Well you know... it's kinda like the EA forums. They just delete the posts they don't like. [[+105]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1ah51f/the_state_of_the_subreddit_and_how_were_going_to/c8xdj7b)

A [counter-post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1ahcna/why_eamaxis_hate_should_not_be_censored/) (currently sitting at +750) reads a little like the community is trying to expose the atrocities of Nazi Germany and comments accuse the mods of being power-hungry.

Now, I am by no means excusing how EA/Maxis have handled the launch of this game, but I do find it sad that in trying to salvage their community, the moderators have been lambasted as censors. It seems there really is a significant change when a subreddit expands very quickly.

1343666760.0,177,self.circlebroke,xeceu,r/worldnews rant,orko1995,218,41,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/xeceu/rworldnews_rant/,"I don't have any examples, I don't want to talk about one specific comment, I just want to talk about r/worldnews and why I hate it, even more than /r/atheism.

You see, when I joined reddit, I - like many others on this subreddit - had their honeymoon period of reddit. Every meme was funny, every link on the frontpage must be upvoted, every fundie must be called out, every republican is stupid. So I am interested in foreign affairs, so I decided to go and read /r/worldnews. At first I thought, ""Holy shit! This place is wonderful! Rather than going to every news site individually to get my news from across the world, or to wait until the evening news, I can just browse the frontpage of this subreddit instead!"" 

Now, this was when the Japan earthquake hit in march '11, and during the recent Libyan Civil War, so there was a lot of actual news in worldnews rather than your usual circlejerks. Soon enough, reddit - like every other person reddit likes to act superior to - got bored with Libya and Japan and moved on to the regular schedule. And by ""regular schedule"" I mean rabid anti-Israel jerking. Being Israeli, it annoyed me, but it isn't anything I haven't seen anywhere else on the internet, so I just thought ""everybody had their biases"" and kept pretending /r/worldnews is a good place to get your news from. But then, as I saw more of /r/worldnews, I noticed a few comments that always pop up in discussions about Israel, *always*:

""Fuck Israel!"" (this is as productive as an /r/worldnews discussion gets)

""Israel is doing to the Palestinians what the Nazis did to the Jews!""/""Sixty years have passed and **THE JEWS** haven't learned a thing!""(apparently you major in history and international politics - not just science - when you become a brave atheist)

""This is paid for by YOUR tax dollars!""

""This is what religion does."" (Because this has everything to do with religion, amirite you guys?)

""I'm not an anti-semite or anything but why are **THE JEWS** so greedy?""/""Look at those greedy Jews! BTW I can't be an anti-semite because I don't hate Arabs and they're also semites so suck it, Jews!""

""Those damn Zionists!"" or its variants 

""As a Jew..."" (because just being Jewish makes you an expert on the field)

""Israel is just a bully!"" (Look at me! I've read several editorialized titles in a heavily-biased website! That makes me an expert, right?)

""Just a reminder, criticizing Israel's actions is not anti-semitism!""

Now, I'd like to talk a little about that last one. You see, as I said, I'm Israeli, so I often look at a lot of arguments about Israel on various international forums on the internet, and I have *never* seen anyone being called an anti-semite for only criticizing Israel. Maybe once or twice, but it then it turned out that this person *was*, actually, anti-semitic, and just also happened to criticize Israel a lot. 

You see, reddit's persecution complex runs so deep, that they shout counter-arguments to arguments *that were never made* to begin with. My main problem with the ""criticism of Israel isn't Antisemitism"" isn't that criticism of Israel hardly ever actually gets branded as anti-semitic, but that redditors remind each other how much criticizing Israel is not anti-semitic, that they start being anti-semitic themselves. Maybe they were bigoted against Jews before, I don't know, but it seems to me like all this argument does is allow redditors to think that their bullshit opinions are not anti-semitic, then go to an Israel-related thread and spout their anti-semitic nonsense over there as much as they want, and then everyone will cheer for them while they can think of how brave they were. And if anyone points out their bigotry, they can just pull out their ""This is just criticism of Israel!"" card and act all persecuted, and everyone will upvote them.

Redditors like to indulge in the same old tired jerks over and over, because they don't have anything new to say, and anything other than what they already know might break their jerk, so they don't dare look around them. This, in turn, means that only things redditors are familiar with and can easily agree upon are ever upvoted, and that means that only hivemind opinions are ever seen. Then, new users see only the hivemind opinions, all the time they're on reddit, and eventually tell themselves ""hey, everyone on this new cool website I've found agrees on this certain point! And I have seen no dissenting opinions, so it must means it's the ultimate truth!"" And thus the jerk grows.

This leads me to another point about /r/worldnews. The upvote/downvote system encourages only easily-digestible material to go through, no anything that requires, oh I dunnoh, actually reading the articles and not just the editorialized title on worldnews. This also means that if you're unfamiliar with a certain concept, you will not bother reading about it. Only things you know about. Does reddit actually know anything about Israeli internal politics? Or Palestinian internal politics? No, why would they? Those are complicated subjects that don't often pop up in their daily lives. Instead you have the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, something that redditors have easily made their minds about. That is also why you will never see posts about Israel or Palestine that aren't about Israelis abusing Palestinians. 

Let me tell you something that happened to me: A few months ago, Tzipi Livni - the head of the opposition in the Israeli parliament - resigned. This is pretty big for Israel - after all, a major politician just resigned. I already realized that /r/worldnews is a huge circlejerk by then, but I still thought it has some sensibility and is just really, extremely biased and that's it, so I searched for Tzipi Livni's name in /r/worldnews to see what redditors think about her resignation. Surprise surprise, there was nothing about her resignation. Instead there was easily-digestible material, where you can clearly see who's the bad guy and who's the good guy, with a *lot* of bias. Things that no Israeli has ever heard of (because they're not actually that important) but reddit jizzes over because it confirms their biases. Not a single thing about actually important stuff, stuff that is happening, that matters to people in the region, that matters to people other than redditors, nothing that actually matters at all. Instead all that I found was ""random guy with unimportant job in the UN condemns Israeli politician Tzipi Livni for her part in oppressing Palestinians.""

I'm frustrated. I'm getting real-mad, not just internet-mad. It's bad enough that they're grouping Syria, Turkey, Libya and Egypt together (countries full of brown people complaining about stuff? must be all the same!) but to even *consider* that the U.S. is comparable to Syria or Libya, two countries where an autocrat will openly (or in Libya's case, was) order his own mercenaries to slaughter his own people in the streets by the thousands, is just another level of crazy. 

I've had it. I'm done. Reddit can keep its sophomoric vendetta against the U.S. and shove it up its ass. I'm so fucking tired of how they're so bored with their own existence that they have to conjure up widespread panic and vitriol and then co-opt the point of an argument which features *any fucking perceived sleight against anything they feel entitled to* just so they'll feel like they're ""a part of something"" (i.e. the hivemind). 

Truthfully, I don't want to put in the effort to link every post from /r/politics and /r/technology about this. It's everywhere. Check out /r/PanicHistory if you'd like to see a few examples. It leads me to wonder how people can wake up in the morning and think ""you know, this seems like a good comparison."" Perhaps because these redditors grew up in an era where the media they consume is dominated by morally ambiguous anti-heroism, eroding gender roles, political polarization. Perhaps because they feel lost... they want to be a part of history, something bigger, so they jump the gun multiple times and ""hope"" for a conflict that doesn't exist. I really don't know.

OP complains that a mother on another subreddit asked if she should put down a hard-of-hearing 13 year old dog down after it snapped at her baby. Keep in mind that she only asked a question. OP meticulously recounts how she heroically explained to the mother that her baby should know better than to be harassing the dog. This is on par with the Wal-Mart mountain dew buying atheist applause receiver. Here are some highlights.

&gt;What is it teaching the child if you immediately kill the dog instead of teaching your children how to respect animals?

IT'S A **BABY**, WHAT WILL IT KNOW? Are we teaching the baby an ethics lesson or are we trying to protect a human life? If the dog ends up biting the kid's nose off, what is that teaching the child? That your old deaf dog was too important than your nose?

&gt;A dog defending itself will bark or snap then become submissive. She states that she understands there's a difference between the two but ""there is no difference if it hurts my baby!"" So, it's ok if your kid runs around poking and hitting and pulling on ears and tails? But if the dog tries to do anything then they must be put to sleep?

Yes, exactly. That's perfectly reasonable. Again -- IT'S A BABY. You can't fucking blame the baby for poking at a dog. Are you seriously implying that the baby should be reprimanded? 

&gt;But what I cannot accept is when a pet is looked at as ""lesser"" because it's an animal, and when new parents don't realize that their dog didn't have a choice in this.

A dog is a lesser. Do you know how many dogs are euthanized daily at shelters? Would we do this to people? No, because dogs are less than humans. Do any people, outside of hippy doodle-brains, look at dogs on the same level as humans? Do we expect our dogs to make a living? This is fucking absurd. Is OP spending his/her free time picketing pounds because they euthanize a shit ton of cats and dogs every day? Should that be equal with murder?

And the grand daddy of them all:

&gt;It appears to me that she is willing to throw away 13 years of loyalty for one immature child.

NO. **IT'S A BABY**, NOT AN IMMATURE CHILD. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST WHAT THE FUCK? This baby could could be like 8 months old for all we know, and OP is going to call it immature? I could almost live with the ""all living beings are equal"" bullshit but this line clearly shows a contempt for babies just for being babies. Immature child? What the fuck is wrong with you?

The thread is question can be found [right here](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1av7hz/well_played_wikipedia/). Some brave soul apparently found their way to the [legendary creature Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendary_creature) after another euphoric soul had made their delightful addition to it that gOD is nothing more than a legendary creature, and realized, rightly so, that it was ratheism gold. Now religious beliefs aside, I'm sure we can all agree that gOD, presumably that of the Abrahamic nature, is not a creature similar to a unicorn, little or not, or a dragon. In fact the Abrahamic ""fairy tale,"" is that humans were created in gOD's image and we are scientific beings not lowly horses or giant lizards. But that is of little consequence, so onto the comments; the brunt of which deal with how they need to make sure this glorious content isn't erased by le fundies. 

&gt;Hey folks, please actually contribute to Wikipedia by providing references and citations rather than simply changing the text. I've cleaned it up and made it sourced, so it can no longer be removed without first disputing the sources. Thanks.

A decent contribution to the conversation. I don't know of which sources they speak as the only one with a web link doesn't mention gOD, but that's besides the point. If the ratheists want to have their fun on Wikipedia the least they could do is source their contributions. Nope.

And thus the point of this post. I don't subscribe to /r/atheism or their beliefs, and lack thereof, but I'm mostly fine with them being angry at the world so long as it's contained in their delightful sub. The idea that they need to spread their logic and reason to Wikipedia and change pages to try and prove a point rather than actually expand the articles is disheartening. But nothing will stop them until the world is finally free of the binding shackles that religion is (or something).

This is the most recent addition to the above thread, and as you can see, it certainly adds a lot to the conversation and is sitting pretty at (39|8). But it's fine because you know, they're taking the power away from that word by using it in a way that no one has used it in any recent times.

&gt;You know its pretty disrespectful to call vandalize wikipedia to call the majority of the worlds beliefs to be ""fake"". Do I go around and call out you neckbeards for faking theyre girlfriends? No, cause its rude. Keep your circlejerk out of wikipedia

Another person trying to disuade the community from altering Wikipedia ""for teh lulz,"" but they are currently sitting at (-2) because the OP already said they didn't put it there. Whether OP put it there or not is irrelevant though because as the thread quoted here shows the mention of gOD was deleted and then re-added. So it's fine to change it as long it wasn't the OP who did it. 

Now just one more because why not?

These are large subreddits which attract a certain kind of redditor, and which promote their circlejerk in nearly every thread.

Dig a little deeper, some people say, and you can get to the meat of reddit. The smaller subs focused on your interests. This doesn't mean that all smaller subs are better, and in fact some are worse.

Introducing /r/politicalhumor. Now it isn't a *small* subreddit, with nearly 25,000 subscribers, but it is a lot smaller than the major reddits, but it attracts an audience nearly all composed of the worst of /r/politics.

I originally was attracted to it because I thought it would feature political cartoons like [this](http://0.tqn.com/d/politicalhumor/1/0/4/3/5/Inauguration-Day.jpg). Oh how wrong I was. When I find a new sub which I might subscribe too the first thing I look at is the top posts. But first impressions are important and hot posts like [this](http://i.imgur.com/Dd7yRbz.jpg), [this](http://i.qkme.me/3sqeny.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/9jxpWfW.jpg). Like most of the other links on the front page at the moment they are mostly image macros, not the high brow political humor I was expecting. I guess that was my fault.

Now let's have a look at the top voted links. Maybe the decline into macros, partisanship and, frankly, unfunny posts may only be a recent development. Perhaps politicalhumor was better in the past? Place your bets here.

Oops. The usual anti-republican politics was well and alive throughout /r/politicalhumor's life. The top voted links are as follows.

[Please Steve, we need you](http://i.imgur.com/YbzcQ.jpg)

[Relatable Mitt's advice to those in the path of Hurricane Sandy](http://i.qkme.me/3rjy7h.jpg)

[John McCain had a choice...](http://i.imgur.com/th1tr.jpg)

Keep in mind those are the posts which users of /r/politicalhumor thought was the best which they had seen.

I would go into the comments, but seeing as these types of macros, they are not *memes* (a pet peeve of mine), attract very little comment, most have less than ten on the front page, I don't think it would be worthwhile. It wouldn't be good for my health either, with the quality of the links I'd hardly expect a nuanced discussion dissecting the meaning behind these images.

This comment does the same thing many others do in this thread, assume the person posting the picture is doing so to show how hot the girl was before cancer, not even considering that maybe they want to show the difference between the girl before cancer and after, bringing awareness to the horrors of the disease. But of course, everything posted on reddit is posted because of superficial reasons.

EDIT 2: This one needs to be posted.

&gt;[""You know what sucks? The only reason this gains publicity because she is hot. Just like Amanda todd, who drank bleach, there were atleast 5 other kids who killed themselves the same day.

The truth? This person is implying that the only reason people cared about this girl, this wonderful person who got the worst disease possible during the happiest years of her life, is only paid attention to because she is good-looking? That is atrocious. You can't possibly think that people are only concerned with each other's looks? You have to have more faith in humanity than that.

&gt;since you've only been here for six months, how about respecting our aboriginal population by not calling them ""abo's"". 

Remember Reddit, you have to keep your hatred of African descended black people on the down low, you can only complain about the culture and make passive-aggressive jokes, but smaller and more distant minorities like the Roma and Australian Aborigines are fair targets for undisguised hatred and abuse!  

EDIT: Oh god how did I miss this le gem?!: 
&gt;I love how all the people who don't live in Australia are attempting to defend Australian Aboriginals here...it's hilarious...I've lived in several Aborigional communities in Australia (in Western Australia/Queensland/Northern Territory) and once you've seen drunk abbos passed out naked in the street or an abbo bashing a stray dog to death you kind of lose respect for them. It's a perspective thing. My dog has no tail because abbo cunts cut it off and ate it (this has been confirmed btw, the dog was a stray from an abbo community and when we picked it up it was pretty much half dead and it's common practice for abbos out in remote areas to eat dogs tails, etc..)

&gt;Ok, I'm kind of ranting here but the amount of racial abuse I've had spewed at me by aboriginals and the shocking shit I've seen has given me an accurate view of aboriginals in Australia. There's probably 1 or 2% that actually get their shit together and make something of themselves but that's it (I've only met several aboriginals in my entire lift that have actually made something of themselves and aren't a pile of shit sitting in the street puffing on a smoke they found in the gutter and abusing passers by and kicking dogs)

&gt;Go visit Palm Island, Roebourne, Alice Springs and other places populated heavily by aboriginals and see if you still have the same ignorant skewered perspective. they're a bunch of blood sucking good for nothing cunts whose existance is entirely worthless. I wouldn't have a problem if they did something with their lives but the fact that pretty much all of them sit around sniffing petrol, go out raping kids and stealing shit throws away any possible respect for them. I meanf or fuck sake they made 'Opal fuel' which is an odurless fuel because the abbocunts kept sniffing it. jesus fucking christ.

I know that taking shots at /r/politics is cheap, but when I saw how nonsensical this was I was compelled to post.  

The question itself leads everyone into the ""Romney bad"" immediately (with a wonderfully leading title) and sets the stage perfectly for a discussion of how terrible of a person Mitt Romney is.  Certainly his phrasing was poor and clumsy, but it also reveals that they believed that there are positions in the cabinet that they are willing to place women into and that they believe there are plenty of them who are capable of handling the duties.  So while it wasn't the best way to phrase it, Romney was attempting to show that the Republican Party was trying to include female cabinet members.

Now for the comments

&gt;[No. The most offensive remark he made last night was when he blamed single parent families and people who don't get married before having children for the rise in AK47s and gun violence. Pure unadulterated BS.](www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11ml2m/mitts_binders_full_of_women_may_have_been_the/c6nrlrx)

This is the current top comment, sitting at 1127 points.  Romney apparently has made the top 2 offensive answers in the history of presidential debates.  Sure, both of them may have been spun out of context and seen from the point of view that the man is some sort of incarnation of malevolence, but that doesn't make this judgement subjective.

Following that comment is a thread talking about all the single kids throughout history that were Reddit's heroes, before devolving into a bunch of smug joking over how George Washington was a gang leader.

&gt;[My jaw dropped when he started going on about ""if you're going to have women in the workforce"" you have to be flexible so they can go home and cook dinner -- and following that there was a whole spiel about in his economy employers will be ""so anxious to get good workers they’re going to be anxious to hire women."" Not sure exactly what that meant, but it sounded like ""employers will be so desperate for workers that they'll even have to seek women."" Eeeeugh.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11ml2m/mitts_binders_full_of_women_may_have_been_the/c6nrok0)

The next comment, sitting at 700 points, helps us understand what Mitt Romney's REAL agenda is by interperating some of his other quotes from that night.  The first part does show him to be ""out of touch,"" but the second part is once again warped to be seen in the worst possible light.  They act as though Romney is some sort of devilspawn who seeks to usher in the American dark ages instead of a politician who wants his shot at getting in the history books and trying to put through some of his party's legislation, which he most likely believes will help America.  

That thread is almost immediately derailed by ""lol, Titties!"" a phenomenon that usually occurs within serious political arguments.

&gt;[in the history of American presidential debates.  You guys are so cute sometimes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11ml2m/mitts_binders_full_of_women_may_have_been_the/c6nrr0h)

Fortunately, this thread pops up (currently at 520 points) to illustrate that while Romney's ill-phrased fumblings aren't exactly the best rhetoric ever, they are far from the worst.  

Going further down the comments, I see people calling him out for lying about how the binder came about and plenty more Romney hate.  I understand that the man has some backwards ideas, but he is being made out to be the most evil man who ever existed.  The funniest part is that by this time next year (if he doesn't get voted in) no one will remember any of this crap.  Everyone will just remember him in the way they remember John Kerry, as some guy who was running for president and didn't get in.

1375316587.0,174,self.circlebroke,1jgkas,A TIL post about cartel violence brings out the strangest mosaic of jerks and counterjerks I've ever seen.,Khiva,206,32,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1jgkas/a_til_post_about_cartel_violence_brings_out_the/,"Without getting into so much detail that it would ruin your day, there was a [popular TIL post today](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jfino/til_in_2011_drug_cartel_kidnapped_hundreds_of/) which described a series of heinous, gut-wrenching acts perpetuated by Mexican cartels.  The news is genuinely day-ruiningly sad, but the reaction of reddit was genuinely fascinating.  Not just because it brought out the usual jerks, but that it brought out _so many_.  

Naturally first on the plate is the ""the solution to every policy problem ever is legalize every drug ever conceived"" brigade, represented [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jfino/til_in_2011_drug_cartel_kidnapped_hundreds_of/cbe94vl) but is naturally up and down the thread.  It's hard to quite call it an out-of-control jerk, though, since there's actually a good bit of back and forth, some of which was interesting to read.  Still, as you can imagine, it was pretty all over the place.

Naturally, though, there was one viewpoint which was generally quite unwelcome:

&gt;&gt;Another way would be for Americans to stop buying drugs from Mexican suppliers. -1

Because redditors are quick to boycott Ubisoft over DRM or Chik-fil-A for its stance on gay marriage, but boycotting drugs because the funds may well head back to a cartel which forces people to duel to the death?  Come on, now.

But that's not too terribly surprising.  Check out all the other jerks which showed up:

* Right off the bat, we've got a [great example of how going for the easy derp utterly derails what could have been an interesting thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jfino/til_in_2011_drug_cartel_kidnapped_hundreds_of/cbe9ut3?context=3).

What really surprised me, though, was the sudden upswell of support in _favor_ of US military aggression:

A) 

&gt;&gt;Let's hope this level of violence does not spill over the border and that Mexico can get this under control somehow. Columbia is managing to, but not without help. Funny how the US is typically willing to go to war for things like this a world away, but when it happens right next 
door...  +182

B)

&gt;&gt;Why don't they just kill all of them? Where is the NSA when you need them? +26

C)

&gt;&gt;How do you stay ahead of a well-armed predator drone with a live video camera satellite link? +27

D)

&gt;&gt;Can't these assholes be drone striked to holy hell? +38

E)

&gt;&gt;Treat it like Iraq or Afghanistan. Suspects get drone strikes. No trial. +17

F)

&gt;&gt;And we're in Iraq and Afghanistan, WHY!?!?!?!?!
Instead of running around the sands of those God-forsaken hellholes, our Marines, and Soldiers should be sent into Mexico to deal with the subhuman animals. [score hidden]

So what to make of this?  The standard reaction is, of course, that ""there's more than one kind of person on reddit,"" but I'm not really sure I buy that.  A post calling for drone strikes or US military force in _any other thread_ would get downvoted to oblivion, so there must be something about _this particular post_ that makes it special.  

I'm reminded of a similar swell of support for the US military back around March, when there was a flurry of activity coming from North Korea and a swarm of retaliatory ""free them back to the Stone Age"" posts.  I recall there being a thread about US military capacity that ended up being one of a very small handful of threadwide pro-US jerks I've ever seen in a default sub.  This strikes me as similar.

Feel free to dissent, but what I think this points to is a certain shallowness to most redditors' political convictions that can be easily manipulated by context, emotion or second-option bias.  Surely the cartels of Mexico are not substantially more nasty or violent than the Taliban at their worst, and it's hard to imagine that the atrocities described in the TIL post are any more senseless or barbaric than the 9/11 attacks.  What distinguishes the two is that, regarding the Mexican cartel atrocities, there's no popular ""first-option"" to immediately reject.  There's no one to contradict, no edgy position to trumpet, nothing to bravely brave against.  In the absence of that context, we're left with merely the knee-jerk first instinct, which is rage and a primal desire for fleshy justice.

Take any of the positions in that thread, imagine them becoming Fox News talking points or poorly spelled posts on the Facebook walls of 14 year old girls, and the tone suddenly snaps in the other direction.

...which leads to:

&gt;One of the joys of raising kids is to see them grow up and make something special of themselves. This way you're just sitting heartbroken and exhausted until you die of old age.

Meaning that apparently you can never be happy about a mentally handicapped child.

Meanwhile, a step down, insert in some old-timey racial classification with derogatory terms targeted at two separate groups!

&gt; Why would anyone want a mongoloid child that you have to support until one of you dies? Fuck that. And you can't have grandkids.

At least kids aren't being seen as a universal curse, I guess ...

Don't forget the role of nature!  Hawks eat babies all the time, right?

&gt; It's just that back in the day, nature would handle these problems for you. A pack of dogs would eat them or a giant hawk would carry them off.

I'm not sure, but this poster makes it sound like the developmentally disabled are...like...pets:

I put punked in quotes because the guy doing the interview can't keep a straight face, doesn't give any clever answers, and is called out almost immediately and then cut short. The anchorwoman responds calmly and gets some mild jabs in at the guy, then moves on without missing a beat. Regardless of what you think of Fox News and their political views, this guy fell flat on his face. 
 
Or wait, I guess he didnt..? 
 
&gt;This guy is a genius. Out of nowhere he exposes how uninformed, out of touch and idiotic the reporting and interviewees on Fox News are. He demonstrated how Fox News watchers are voting for Romney simply based on moronic reasons like losing a basketball game and nothing else - which by the way has little to do with Obama being president.

&gt;Like seriously, how does Fox manage to get called or referred to as serious news reporting? Living in the UK, this just seems ludicrous that a current affairs program/station can be so outwardly and openly biased. Are there US News stations which provide the other view, or any truly unbiased news sources?

So Reddit hates Fox News, and deifies glorious UK journalism, I get it, but HOW in any way did that video show anyone as being incompetent besides Brave Hero Max? Perhaps it was from the loaded question asked by former Miss America ([PS I GOOGLED HER, SHES HOT](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/100ui4/fox_and_friends_gets_punked_by_worst_interview/c69f7pg)) about unemployment among young adults: 
 
&gt;Did that statistic she presented bother anyone else? Of course it's twice the national average, you included 18 year old. Where was I when i was 18? Living with my parents while i went to high school. And whats that? You also included people who are at College age? Well since they're unemployed, it must be Obama's fault, and not say the fact that they're still in college.

So, you may or not be familiar with reddit's local lair of gym and health enthusiastic club, fittit. A subreddit that has it's own share of jerks, mostly a bad heritage from 4chan's /fit/ board, ranging from dumb memes (DYEL) to the blind worship of Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength (at the point where any front page submitted transformation post gets ripped on for the lack of 'adequate' leg development or their lack of squats n oatz)... but the analysis of /r/fitness' jerk-culture is outside of the scope of my post, as today they've proved to be a gang of refreshingly understanding but stern people.

Let's look at this post:

[Some thoughts regarding a date I had with an overweight girl, and the moral and ethical struggle that ensued.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1alg3b/some_thoughts_regarding_a_date_i_had_with_an/)

TL;DR - OP went on a date with a girl he *really, really* likes, but alas, the girl is overweight while OP isn't, so he shares with us his viewpoint on the possible reasons for this situation in a thinly-veiled rationalization / validation seeking essay.

What I expected coming in on the topic was an immature, mutual back-patting, and a judgmental attitude towards, well, fat people, instead we find this:

&gt;I'll just bring this up here: you know better. She may not. ""Pilates and Wii"" may make you think she doesn't care, but it may also be the best she knows. She obviously cares enough to do something.
If you weren't feeling it, that's no fault of your own and your choice and right. However, if you get along as well as you say you do and are staying friends, perhaps use this opportunity to be a good influence on her health. She may have all the desire in the world to be healthier but just have no good direction.
As an anecdote, I was a 260lb kid with a 100lb frame when I met my wife. It was only her care and positive influence that got me to get my life on track and get fit. I didn't want to be fat, but I didn't know any better! I'm glad she didn't just give up on me then, because we have a really great relationship now. [+780](http://np.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1alg3b/some_thoughts_regarding_a_date_i_had_with_an/c8yhlpk)

Or this:
&gt;Are you a dick for not sleeping with her? No, you weren't attracted to her! Are you a dick for not being attracted to her? No. You can't control attraction. Are you a dick for some other reason? Yes. You're judgmental, pretentious and arrogant. You know you are. You've identified the issue yourself: Then I wonder, when did I start thinking like this? Am I an ass for thinking this? Yeah, you're an ass for thinking like that! You're NOT in her shoes. She's a successful, funny lawyer. Those are three qualities that are rarely found together in a functioning human being. She sounds awesome, while you sound like someone who would say this: It helps me eat well, not just well, but fucking amazingly. with a straight face! ""Fucking amazingly?"" Man, it's just calories! When I eat at French Laundry, I say I ate fucking amazingly. If I cut processed grains from my diet, I say I ate dinner. (And I keep it to myself, because there's nothing, nothing, more pretentious and obnoxious than humble-bragging about dietary choices! Ooh, you're a vegan? Here's $4.25, buy yourself a soy latte!) She dodged a bullet that night. Here's a clue. Do you think she'd still be friends with you if you told her what you've just posted here? If not, you're a dick.
[+171](http://np.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1alg3b/some_thoughts_regarding_a_date_i_had_with_an/c8yi9zg)

...and some:

&gt;I disagree that you're being true to yourself.
""I'm not attracted to her"" is being true to yourself. Dating is one of the few times in this life where it's perfectly acceptable to judge someone primarily on the basis of his or her appearance.
I do feel that when you bring up this notion of ""seriousness,"" you're rationalizing. The societal norm is to disagree with my above paragraph. We're not supposed to be ""shallow."" We don't, as far as I know, have a word in English for ""shallow"" that has a positive connotation, even though that's exactly what I think everyone agrees should happen.
You don't want to feel that you're being shallow and disapproving of someone who's otherwise awesome on the basis of her looks (which, as I noted, is what you're supposed to do despite whatever bullshit storybooks to the contrary), so you come up with this concept of ""seriousness"" to justify your choice.
""Seriousness"" is just a high horse. There's a vast wealth of fitness miscommunication in society, and I suggest that she was doing her best to connect to you over it - to prove her cred if you will. She could be perfectly serious, but also pretty deeply misinformed. Fitness knowledge is not commonplace, and it's almost a joke how we all consider ourselves experts because we read Starting Strength and don't like Zumba, when we can all remember when we didn't know, or worse knew only broscience.
Frankly, nearly everyone comes to that deeper sort of understanding and ""seriousness"" through the less serious stuff. And even forgetting that, look at your own unspoken suggestions to her - you're just substituting your own judgment. Not everyone would agree with your advice, because there's always a higher horse. In fact, there's nothing to say that she couldn't achieve her general goals with what she's doing, just less effectively.
I think that you felt the need to lie about it (""I didn't bring up the fitness thing, I just said that I didn't feel an emotional connection."") extremely telling. You know that it's somehow unflattering. But I'm suggesting is that you don't need to be embarrassed at that initial ""not attracted."" You don't need to reconstruct it.
TL;DR: it's okay to call it off with someone because she's too fat, it's not okay to get all ""do you even lift, gurl"" about it. [+82](np://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1alg3b/some_thoughts_regarding_a_date_i_had_with_an/c8yhrns)


Naturally, the topic of interest is *why* would a subreddit so inclined to be jerky be dominated by a normal conversation? I mean, the post itself, with all it's faults has reached the front page, and we can find many examples of knee-jerk and/or hive mind pondering, trigger happy reactions through out the thread in highlighted positions:

[You don't have to justify not being attracted to someone.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1alg3b/some_thoughts_regarding_a_date_i_had_with_an/c8yhi7p)[+567]

[/r/BodyAcceptance would be enraged if they saw this.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1alg3b/some_thoughts_regarding_a_date_i_had_with_an/c8yhg20)[+93]

Dwelling deeper in the thread uncovers more of both attitudes, but as we're seven hours in, it seems that the attitude of calling out the faults, not being a prick about it and understanding both sides of the argument has prevailed. Even the OP himself on several occasions shows signs of understanding where his faults lie, and is never taking the stance of a hurt or defensive person.

I would speculate that the reason for this is that /r/fitness is a community where the barrier of entry is, on some self-accepted level, higher than for most of the click-and-submit subs. What this means, in effect, that the people commenting, no matter how far they traveled on their level of interest, have a much more solid understanding of where they are, where they began, and where they are headed. It's a different ballpark from politics or atheism or cringe, where anyone can feel they are an authority. The good portion of fittit's community, despite how strong or fit they made it, knows on a very visceral level what it means to be weak or out of shape, and can relate as humans to the itemized subjects of such conversations better. Here, it isn't about smugness or internet points, but rather something refreshingly humane in a common struggle.

---

Right off the bat, you can tell this is going to be a good one. It has the two key ingredients for a good 4chan jerk: Someone with the nerve to go on /b/ with a conscience and the word ""faggot"". Now, let's see who can post the most vile, antisocial comment to rake in that sweet karma.

Top comment:
&gt;&gt;""some people are born with depression""

&gt;then why the fuck is it 4chan's fault that this plump is cutting herself

That's the spirit! Let's make fun of what's probably a 14 year old girl for being fat. Oh, and even though we encouraged her to cut her wrists, it's totally not our fault that she actually did since she was born with depression.

Currently standing at -11 points is this asinine response:

&gt;Yea it's not like 4chan directly asked her to cut herself or anything! Now downvote me I can take it.

""Hahaha, look at this guy. Who does he think he is placing blame on us? FAGGOT!""

&gt;If I hook my balls up to a car battery and electrocute myself because the mood struck me, I'm just stupid.
But if I hook my balls up to a car battery and electrocute myself because some anonymous image board told me to, well then shame on anonymous image board and down with them. Where is the personal responsibility these outraged parents have? Oh thafs right, **faggot** PC generation where we're all winners.

Ok, maybe this guy has a point. I mean, we all know that pre-teen to teenage girls aren't prone to influence or fads among their peers. Forget the fact the ""prank"" was designed so that the girls thought it was other young girls telling them to mutilate themselves, no, this is the fault of bad parenting and political correctness.  Before it, young girls were never hormonal or irrational.

&gt;Some people were born fat too. It doesn't give them extra privileges.

What does this even mean? I know the privilege thing is one of the less funny in-jokes, but I don't see how it applies here.

&gt;**Faggot** has got a point... Stupid bitches really will do this shit. Which is why I think we should stop #cuttingforbieber and bring in #suicideforbieber instead

How edgy of you.

&gt;some people are just born massive **faggot**s,right op

There's a lot of this in the thread, which brings me to another point I've been meaning to post about. ""/b/tards"" (and Redditors) will always justify their use of the word ""faggot"" by saying that since they use it to refer to themselves and each other, they're actually doing a service to the gay community by watering down the word's meaning. But threads like this prove that that's just backwards reasoning used so people won't criticize them for their usage of it. If they really cared about the word's significance, they wouldn't be using it derogatorily like they are here. (I know that ""OP is a faggot"" is an unfunny in joke of its own, but that isn't what this is).

My best friend is gay. I guess that this might offend me if I thought they did it for any other reason then to get a reaction out of me, but I don't want to give them the satisfaction. For now my ""jimmies"" remain ""unrustled"".

&gt;As far as I can tell, 4chan need had any borders or limits to break. From the shit I've seen, 4chan can be your best friend or your worst enemy, it seems most people choose the latter.

I wouldn't want to be best friends with a bunch of reaction-bating shitheads either.

&gt;&gt;and massive **faggot**ry.

&gt;More like trolling, can't believe people are so bad at detecting such obvious trolls these days.

Uh huh. Anyone who doesn't think that coercing young girls into self-harm ""for teh lulz"" is a good idea is obviously trolling.

&gt;The dude has some points actually, not enough to claim heterosexuality though

That one's at -5 currently. The seven downvotes I assume are due to the fact that he gave the comment referred to by the OP credit. The upvotes probably because he still called him gay.

---

I subscribe to /r/4chan because I think a lot of the stuff they produce is really funny. The greentext stories are often entertaining, and the harmless pranks like what they pull with the bodybuilding.com help chat give me a chuckle now and then. I get that a lot of the humor is based around being edgy for no good reason, which is fine in moderation, but not when it actually spills over into the real world and young girls are actually harming themselves because of it. We don't have to pretend that since the product of a website is often entertainingly crass that there are no lines they shouldn't cross in the name of humor. It would be one thing to simply make fun of this stupid trend, if that's really what it was: A stupid trend, not a coordinated ""prank"". This is beyond the normal 4chan irreverence. Spamming votes to name a McDonalds sandwich the ""McHitler"" is harmless. Voting for Kim Jong Un to be Time's PoTY is harmless. Coercing tween girls into cutting themselves isn't. The fact that girls are in harms way because of this stunt is obviously no laughing matter for any sane human being. Any defense of it is going to make me think twice about any of the inappropriate humor I see coming from there from now on. As tasteless as a joke about, oh say, murder is, in the context of fiction it can still be funny. Now any time I see a post on /r/4chan making light out of a serious issue, I'm going to have to take a step back and say, ""wow, there's a good chance that they actually feel that way.""

Seacrest, out.

In summary, a single father found his daughter's copy of *50 Shades of Grey*, annotated with remarks about sex acts she would like to and has performed with a boy the father has never heard of.

The very top comment gets things off to a great start with Reddit's favourite incestuous ~~pedophilia~~ ephebophilia ""humour"":

You would think the inevitability of this kind of reply would deter anybody from asking Reddit about their serious life problems. How old do you think that commenter was? Do you think he has kids of his own? His context is a mystery -- fourteen year old wit or aged, divorced pervert, he nonetheless shares with the rest of us his irreverence and contempt for human relationships. How fortunate we are to live in an age that allows such ubiquitous human connections.

Next, like the shining tail on that blazing comet of perversion, comes what seems to be the ""nice"" counterpart to that quip: the morally relativistic reply from a woman who has been there, and also discovered that she likes to be ritualistically abused by men!

&gt; [Okay, here's the thing, kids are kids. ... Now that stuff like Fifty Shades of Gray is popular I highly doubt that your daughter is going through any of the moral dillemas I went through, but there's still a lot more about the BDSM lifestyle that she needs to know that she cannot learn from that book. ... If you decide to let her experiment with some BDSM (let's be honest, even if you forbid it, she'll do it anyways) I'd seriously recommend you talk to her about consent, and what is acceptable, and what isn't. ...

This commenter does suggest, quite practically, that the father check his daughter's annotations in the book to ensure she's not doing anything physically dangerous. But on the whole, this comment, considered the best of the ""advice"" by Reddit's voters, sees no issues with thirteen year old girls not only exploring their sexuality, but experimenting with sadomasochism. (It doesn't sound so nice when you don't euphemize it as ""BDSM"", eh?) The numbers bear it out: she's not the only one, and therefore it's totally normal and okay! And of course, a thirteen year old is totally able to understand the complexities of consent when it comes to sex acts whose very nature depends on using the line between ""consent"" and ""rape"" like a shibari rope.

Kids are embarrassed and disgusted by their parents' sex lives? HA! Reddit's observational humour once again shines light on the hidden corners of life. The circlejerk is a beautiful testament to how quickly ""edgy"" descends into ""banal and cliche"". Redditors ride the same cliche jokes over and over for that sweet Internet attention, all the while convincing themselves they're breaking the mould.

After [the first reasonable advice comment in the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11qgxd/i_found_a_dogeared_copy_of_fifty_shades_of_grey/c6opqis), the father admits he hasn't yet had the sex talk with his kid. Redditors don't like this, oh no. Every girl has to be warmed up to sex and watching hardcore pornography by the age of twelve, otherwise in high school she might turn into a friendzoner!

&gt; [Sorry, but what? You know puberty happens somewhat prior to high school, right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11qgxd/i_found_a_dogeared_copy_of_fifty_shades_of_grey/c6or3j8) (+53)

&gt; [So fucking what? Nobody said parenting was supposed to be easy or comfortable all the time. You have two options: Deal with reality or risk having a pregnant/sick daughter.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11qgxd/i_found_a_dogeared_copy_of_fifty_shades_of_grey/c6otms7) (+1)

Note also the ""le rational Europe vs ign'ant Amerikkkans"" talk going on in these discussions. Reddit thinks it knows all about this man's life, his relationship with his daughter, and how best, as a parent, to manage an adolescent's growing curiosity about sex. I wonder how many of them honestly gained or grew in character from tearing off their clothes and mating the moment Mom and Dad weren't looking? But no matter. Hormones are all-powerful and not to be argued with -- you wouldn't want to say *no* to a teenager's whim, would you?

Then of course, we meet the anti-*50 Shades* brigade:

&gt; [Talk to her about her terrible taste in literature.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11qgxd/i_found_a_dogeared_copy_of_fifty_shades_of_grey/c6oq7jd) (+64)

The hivemind sorts famous people in two groups: Reddit Approved Celebrities ™ and ""Douchebags we must hate"". If your name is Neil Patrick Harris or Zach Braff, you may as well commit genocide but redditors would still ride you dick at every inane tweet you will post.
But if you aren't a Reddit Approved Celebrity™, times will be harsh for you. Every action you may take and every misfortune you may encounter in your life will be used by the hivemind as a fuel for their rage. You will be called a talentless, spoiled, egomaniac cunt if you don't fit in the geeky niche reddit loves. Pop singers, Disney starlets, reality shows contestants will fall victim to the pitchforks of the jaded neckbeards. How dare people enjoy entertainment that isn't a Judd Apatow crapola or a Lord of the Rings movie?  

Demi Lovato is a perfect prey for the angry redditor: a Disney ready-made pop singer with a troubled past. 
[This clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAEwDZ0b9-U) is a redditor wet dream. It has everything: a mainstream celebrity straight out of rehab, the heroic average Joe that's brave enough to fight the System and the ""good famous guy"" that tacitly supports Reddit's sentiments. 

So, Demi Lovato job right now is judging people on a singing competition, and guess what, that's what she does. Who the fuck this bitch think she is!? Sharpen your pitchforks guys!
The Hivemind, in full combat attire, relentlessly spews countless comments full of ""i'm pretty sure"" and ""some guy told me"", and those are good enough to condemn the spoiled brat to internet death. 
Obviously, the most popular type of comment is [""Who is Demi Lovato""](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/zkgkv/demi_lovato_gets_burned_by_xfactor_contestant/c65dkx8)? [Because Redditors are too cool to know who a girl that's constantly on national television is](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/zkgkv/demi_lovato_gets_burned_by_xfactor_contestant/c65dw3c) despite spending most of their life consuming pop culture. [Really, my coolness radar is off the charts](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/zkgkv/demi_lovato_gets_burned_by_xfactor_contestant/c65g030). But wait, the most brave of them know the mysterious Lovato. [This guy posts an assumptions-fest (i know a guy that knows someone that heard someone say)](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/zkgkv/demi_lovato_gets_burned_by_xfactor_contestant/c65gowb). [Assumptions, assumptions everywhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/zkcsa/ouch/c65dpq7).
Demi Lovato is also a [""cunt...and she is there because her mother sucked a lot of dicks""](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/zkcsa/ouch/c65dp0s). 
Demi Lovato anti-bullying campaing is [""bullshit- i heard she's actually very mean...she even has an ugly smile.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/zkcsa/ouch/c65dfvi) As in: i don't care if she tries to help people- someone on the internet told me she is a bitch! Others took [bravery to a whole new level](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/zkcsa/ouch/c65dbik). 

So, Lovato told a guy that ""a lot of people work really hard for this, but it's not meant for everyone"", but according to Reddit she can't, because, despite being the competition judge, [she must tell everyone that they are great singers that will go far in life, instead of being a cunt](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/zkgkv/demi_lovato_gets_burned_by_xfactor_contestant/c65f2mp). But, [plot twist](http://www.unrealitytv.co.uk/x-factor/x-factor-usa-simon-cowell-and-la-reid-defended-demi-lovato-after-creepy-wannabe-insulted-her/): why Spears looked so uncomfortable while looking at the guy? Because, according to some [sources](http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/76765/Demi-Lovato-Insulted-By-Angry-X-Factor-Reject), the guy sang ""a sexually-charged, self-written song to a 16-year-old in the audience"". But wait, we can't accept unreliable sources if they will [interrupt our circlejerk](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/zkcsa/ouch/c65do3q), (they are ok in r/politics though, as long as they support our biased opinions). 

Usual Hivemind: despite thinking of themselves as a group of enlightened, smart people, Redditors are really the most simple bunch you can think of. They oversimplify events to satisfy they very basic needs, they don't follow reasons but emotions, they can't wait to vent off the rage against the ""Man"". 
And, most important, they also fail to realize that a good 80% of those shows are scripted, and the authors were trying to provoke the exact same reactions the commenters of those threads show. Redditors desperately try to stand out from the crowd (the number of ""i don't know who them are"" comments is pathetic), while failing to understand they are part of that exact crowd.

tl;dr: Old good Reddit hate against celebrities, jaded neckbeards ""don't know who she is...but they are sure she uses autotune... and she must be a cunt"". The same jaded neckbeards will be shocked to know that [the girl can actually sing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1BOgNwrUAw&amp;feature=fvst) and even they favorite super cool bands [use autotune](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1877372-2,00.html).",Approved Novel,False,,t5_2tnz9,1347193760.0,,,True,t3_zl6tw,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/zl6tw/one_of_reddit_favorite_pastime_hate_against/,

There's a good amount of horny dudes on Reddit. A lot. A quick look at the comment sections of any number of pictures with women in it can show that Redditors are hornier than a rhinoceros orgy. 

And apparently, in their horniness, Redditors don't know what ""Not Safe for Work"" means.

The NSFW acronym has been around the Internet for quite a long time. NSFW means, well, exactly that. *Not Safe For Work*. Whether it's a picture of a skimpy cosplayer or a video of a squirrel getting run over, there's a lot of things that could earn you a trip to HR.

But somewhere down the line, the meaning of NSFW got changed to ""boobs boobs boobs."" The jerk pervades the comments of posts dating from a few days ago to years past:

Perhaps all of this is because Reddit has a large amount of teenage users, and as such they're all eager to see some cleavage? Or maybe because there's so many unemployed Redditors out there, they get angry when they don't see nudity, since ""I don't have a boss looking over my shoulder anymore."" Who knows?

But it boggles the mind.

The thread is [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/13v5hn/til_that_r_kelly_is_illiterate/)

Reddit, in it's infinite wisdom, has decided that not only learning disorders are not real, but also that R.Kelly can't read because he is black. Also, this should be laughed at apparently.

Here's the top comment

&gt;Hey, everybody! Lets make fun of R. Kelly! What's he gonna do, read our posts? Hahahaha. 

It's followed by many posts along the same line, just adding dashes of racism. But it continues-

&gt;He is illiterate. He does not ""suffer"" from illiteracy.

I'm not even sure what is supposed to imply. That illiteracy is just something he could fix right away if he wanted to? That learning disorders aren't causing it? That he's too rich to be sad from illiteracy? But upvoted to the moon anyway. Here's another-

&gt;This is surprisingly unsurprising

I'm guessing they think it's unsurprising because he is black and associated with ""hood"" culture, which reddit pretends to understand and also detest. 

&gt;They make it sound like an incurable disease.

Well seeing how many learning disorders don't really have a known cause or very good ""cures"" it sort of is sometimes. Dyslexia has varying degrees, but Reddit would rather not concede that.

Also, a top comment is simply linking to [this old racist vertical comic from 4chan](http://i.imgur.com/Mgqx3.jpg) because apparently illiteracy is funny if they are black.

The last one I'll put here-

&gt;I'm sure he suffers a lot... What is this, since when is illiteracy a bloody disease? If you have millions of dollars and you are illiterate, it's probably because you don't give a damn, because you sure as hell can afford the tutoring, and pay extra if you want it to be discreet... he just doesn't care -_-

Because the rich are incapable of suffering or of sadness or most human emotions. Money just solves their problems. The lack of empathy and awareness and jealousy from the reddit users is simply astounding. We can pity R.Kelly even though he is rich and question a system that let him become that way.

Sorry, this whole thread just pissed me off.

It's not a secret that, next to /r/atheism, /r/askreddit is probably the most vulnerable default sub to trolls and griefers. A more appropriate name would probably be /r/storytime. It only takes a marginal level of creativity and twenty minutes at a keyboard to come up with a story believable enough for askreddit to upvote. The front page of the sub is constantly being bombarded with stories of cheating spouses, employers acting like complete assholes, or clearly fabricated tales of social awkwardness.

/r/askreddit only serves as a mechanism for redditors to acquire karma by posting made up stories in the title of their post, followed by a question that could have very easily stood on it's own.

**The Meat:** 

The hugest offender on askreddit has to be [the author of the Colby Saga](http://www.reddit.com/user/concerneddad1965). 

He made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s1o90/i_think_my_teenage_son_may_have_sodomized_our_dog/) post awhile back claiming that he thought his son sodomized his dog. The post he made doesn't really ask a question, but the author says he is completly at a loss, so users are able to infer the question ""What should I do"" from the post.  


Now while this does seem a bit outlandish at a glance, it WOULD make *some* sense for a user to come on reddit with a question like that. It's not every day that you have to deal with the sexual abuse of an animal. 

Naturally, reddit proves to be of very little help the first time around, citing that the teenage son probably lied about using a hairbrush to sodomize the animal.

[The hairbrush was just to test the waters!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s1o90/i_think_my_teenage_son_may_have_sodomized_our_dog/c4ah30o)

[The hairbrush is a lie! Your son lies!!!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s1o90/i_think_my_teenage_son_may_have_sodomized_our_dog/c4ah3z8)

MANY of the comments further down advise the user to **[TAKE YOUR SON TO SEE A PROFESSIONAL TO RESOLVE HIS VERY CLEARLY PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s1o90/i_think_my_teenage_son_may_have_sodomized_our_dog/c4aekm8)**

So you'd **think that the user would understand what he has to do, and go off and do it**

Instead he elects to post about the same damn problem [three](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vemi5/i_am_the_father_and_redditor_whose_son_sodomized/) [more](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yc7zo/update_i_am_the_father_and_redditor_whose_teenage/) [times](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zw3j9/i_am_the_fatherredditor_who_lost_his_family_after/)


The author's story becomes more outlandish, as he claims that his wife divorces him (because she thinks that her husband is lying to her, rather than the mentally disturbed teenager) and calls him a ""dog fucker"" while screaming and crying on his front lawn in front of the neighbors. 

[In the fourth post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zw3j9/i_am_the_fatherredditor_who_lost_his_family_after/) the OP asks reddit:

What to do with my son????!?!?!

....seriously?....

While the OP's story seemed plausible three posts ago, he is clearly just baiting reddit for attention and karma. It could not be more obvious what the OP should ""do with his son"". The OP, assuming he hasn't made up this completely incredible story, should take his son to a therapist for his Scooby doo fetish. 

Naturally reddit, being reddit, upvotes the OP and gives us ASCII dogs:

There were so many interesting questions to ask her, like [this guy looks like you](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztvyi/i_am_laina_aka_the_overly_attached_girlfriend_ama/c67nuxh), or [want to go out tonight?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztvyi/i_am_laina_aka_the_overly_attached_girlfriend_ama/c67nvad), and [could you please show us naked pictures of you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztvyi/i_am_laina_aka_the_overly_attached_girlfriend_ama/c67nzn6), that just had to be answered. 

Then, totally out of nowhere, tragedy struck. For no apparent reason (other than that it was against the rules of the subreddit, but whatever), the AMA of reddit's girlfriend was removed! Who was behind this blatant act of disrespect to the overly attached goddess? If you guessed ~~Hitler~~ Karmanaut you are, surprisingly, incorrect. It seems another mod decided to fall to the same evil ways as Karmanaut, his name was SupermanV2 (may he rest in peace). The only reasonable response, of course, seems to be [OUTRAGE!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztvyi/i_am_laina_aka_the_overly_attached_girlfriend_ama/c67obgu) And does it really matter that the rules were changed since then? [OF COURSE NOT YOU FUCKING IDIOT!!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztvyi/i_am_laina_aka_the_overly_attached_girlfriend_ama/c67om1n) 

This was, of course, a huge blow to the reddit community as a whole. The cries for blood were barely audible above all the crying and sobbing of the poor crushed spirits who so desperately wanted attention from their heroine. So, whatever could these poor, oppressed redditors do? Yup, [start a revolution](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/zvgxl/scumbag_reddit_and_the_removal_of_overly_attached/c681vou), bring in comparisons to Karmanaut just to show everyone how serious this situation is, and of course [go to the user's page to downvote everything he could possible say!](http://www.reddit.com/user/SupermanV2), as long as you don't forget to go to the subreddit about him, /r/supermanv2, which has now been set to private (how dare he?).

And that, ladies and gentleman, was yet another story about internet justice. Don't expect this to be over any time soon, because once the hivemind decides to attack, they never go back. Let this be a lesson to all of you: never, ever, remove something mundane, because the wrath of a thousand redditors will soon be upon you, and you might just end up being the next Karmanaut or Trapped_in_Reddit.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_zw3re,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/zw3re/overly_attached_lynchmob/,

Reddit turns up the compassion to 11...,smurfyjenkins,215,42,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1j4lsv/a_goodlooking_woman_gets_severely_injured_and/,"/r/Wtf gets presented with the following:

* A before-photo of a good-looking woman who happens to show a duck face. 

* An after-photo of that same woman horribly injured and disfigured.

* A story about her taking a ride home on a motorcycle with a ""guy she didn't know"", her falling off the motorcycle and her getting left behind by the driver.

Reddit reaction:

* Conclude that she must be a moron and it must have been her fault that she fell of the motorcycle. Notice that nowhere does the submitter explain the circumstances that lead to her falling off. The submitter frankly doesn't seem to know much about what happened at all (which makes one wonder what he knows about her relationship with the man she drove home with).
* Make spiteful remarks about her finally learning a lesson about ""bad boys"".
* Make endless jokes/express spiteful joy about her not being able to make duck faces anymore.

Here are some choice comments (I'm excluding all the comments merely calling her a moron, check [the thread](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1j322l/a_friend_went_to_a_bar_and_got_a_ride_home_from_a/) which is chock-full of them). 

Bitter teenage boys happy to see a woman learn a lesson about ""bad boys"" the hard way:

&gt; Yep, how is she liking them ""bad boys"" now? (20 points (+42/-25))

&gt; Yerp but he's sooooo coooool with his motorcycle (52 points (+62/-11)).

&gt; Small price to pay for the education she received (41 points (+54/-13)).

Brave user steps in to pre-emptively defend the submitter of the photo (the most bizarre comment in the thread) against anyone who might take offense to him mentioning that the driver drove off:

&gt; My interpretation is this post, is that OP is showing us the results of his/her friend's bad decisions, not defending her actions, and that adding in that the guy drove off, was just a way to further illustrate that she made a bad decision trusting a stranger (393 points (+450/-57)).

Oh yes, let's not attack the OP for inserting the part about the driver driving off. It was clearly inserted into the title to further illustrate how stupid the woman was. The submitter chips in with [""Bingo.""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1j322l/a_friend_went_to_a_bar_and_got_a_ride_home_from_a/cbar6xy) to confirm that his intention was only illustrate how stupid she was. MUST AT NO COST DEFEND HORRIBLY INJURED GIRL.

There are still heroes among us:

&gt; As soon as she fell off his chances of getting laid went to zero and his chances of, losing his license and paying thousands in legal fees went up to about 100 if he would have stayed with her.

&gt; personally i would have stopped but i can see why a lot of people wouldn't (88 points (+109/-17)).

This guy is such a stellar human being that he would actually help someone who had fallen of his motorcycle (have some upvotes, mate). But it would of course have been totally understandable to just leave her there severely injured. It's not like everyone can be arsed to help injured people in need, especially not no-good whores! LETS NOT BLAME THE POOR BLOKE WHO JUST WANTED TO GET LAID. 

Two guys are conversing about why she might have taken a ride home with a stranger and one of them assumes that ""she wanted to fuck"". I can't believe that it took three hours for someone to respond to that with this hilarious comment:

&gt; looks like she got fucked anyway (178 points (+203/-27)) 

Duck face jokes/comments:

&gt; No more duckfaces then (333 points)

&gt; I am happy that she can't make that duck face for sometime (36 points (+63/-26)).

&gt; Do the doctors know if she'll ever be able to duck face again? (37 points (+53/-13))

&gt; This is why you NEVER go duckface (30 points (+47/-14)).

The thread is already replete with duck face jokes so let's find something else to laugh about, right: 

&gt; are we going to ignore her hitler 'stache? (224 points (+261/-40))

Some guy is shocked that not more people immediately located the appearance of a toothbrush mustache in amongst her horrific injuries: 

&gt; Thank god. This comment was so close to the bottom that I though no one else saw it. (29 points (+34/-6))


At what point might reddit actually show compassion to a person who fits so many characteristics that reddit hates (good-looking, female, guilty of doing a duck-face, something bad happened to her+a man was involved to an uncertain degree)?

Anyways, on to the bravery.

for our top comment we have this:

&gt;It sucks, but to me, it's no more tragic than the shit that happens every single day around the world. We have a way of sensationalizing these things, when in reality, they're not much worse than business as usual 

not that bad on its own, I guess society as a whole could probably use a bit more perspective on events like this, but it spawns a torrent of insensitivity towards those who don't share their stoicism.

&gt;One of my Facebook friends said that this was an epidemic, and he was crying because of the incedent. He's 13. I don't understand what the fuck has gotten into today's society.

I don't know, maybe these events hit home for him in a way they don't effect you. A sensible person asks how one can really judge a person for reacting that way when one doesn't know how it effects them emotionally. 
He is rewarded with this response:

&gt;Yeah and I am just as entitled to judge them for being idiots.

There follows in the same thread allegations that people expressing grief on facebook are only doing it for the attention, as well as lots of other relatively uncivil conversation related to the matter. 

Moving on down a ways on the same we have this:

&gt;Somewhere in the region of 20,000 children die every single day from starvation, malnutrition and preventable disease. Why is THAT number less newsworthy than 26 plump, white folks?

and this as well

&gt;I'm not saying this isn't a tragedy, i'm saying it's a tragedy that happens every day and the fact that we choose to highlight this one simply because it's close to home and because it's a bunch of white kids is ignorant at best, and disingenuous at worst.

While these points are, in a way legitimate -- there is certainly a media bias that shields us in the west from a number of global tragedies -- getting pissy at the people mourning these events doesn't strike me as a productive way to change that. It's almost like a contest -- they're insinuating that the thing that makes them sad is more important than the thing that makes others sad. 

At the end of the day, you would never barge into a funeral home and tell all of the people gathered around the casket to get out, that their grief is misplaced in the face of (insert larger tragedy here). I can perfectly understand why people wouldn't feel any personal grief over this event (for a lot of child-free young people like myself it's too far away from our experiences to cause a deep emotional reaction), but there is no reason to get mad at others because they have different feelings on the matter.

Reddit has always toed the hipster line very finely. Touting the fact that conformity *and* non-conformity are both good (or both bad, depending on your point of view), may lead some people to be confused, but not Redditors. People who buy Apple can be wankers, Nickleback can be shit and Twilight for love-struck teenagers, but simultaneously Obama is the future, Community is awesome and Google will lead us into the light.

It doesn't make a lot of sense, and there doesn't seem be any broader theme other than separating virtually every popular activity in groups of ""like"" and ""don't like"", where Reddit can feel both part of broader society, and solidarity with their fellow Redditors for never being able to be part of society.

Doesn't make sense? Good.

**Ye Social Networking**

One area where this is seen most virulently is the dichotomy surrounding Facebook. The thinking dé jour is divided. [One of the top comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12yxq7/i_still_refuse_to_watch_jay_leno_after_the/c6zdpcr) in this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12yxq7/i_still_refuse_to_watch_jay_leno_after_the/) is:

&gt; I still begin all my Facebook statuses with the word ""is,"" like in the good old days.

Followed by an outpouring of support. However, the tables turn in [this single post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12yxq7/i_still_refuse_to_watch_jay_leno_after_the/c6zb8wm). He says first:

&gt; I had already done Planet Friend, MySpace, and all the others. So when FB came out, I took a stand.

My god! What a special flower! Taking a stand against...what exactly? What is it about Facebook that makes people find it so unpalatable? You can make a profile of any size, including any degree of information about yourself, and in return you get another way to stay in contact with your friends and organise social events. That's right! Boycott friends! 

Or maybe there's something in the fact that /r/atheism so often 'owns' people on Facebook that nobody wants to go there any more. 

But then he says:

&gt; 3) I do have a full LinkedIn profile 

And the hypocrisy comes full circle. This 'boycott' isn't a principled stand; its just playing into another hipster circlejerk. Its fine to be part of *another* website that purports to do virtually exactly the same thing as Facebook, but not Facebook itself.

But it gets better: 

&gt; 4) I keep up with my friends via fantasy sports, texts messages, occasional travel, and **even a phone call** 

This is one my parents used to use all the time (as I was a teenager when MSN Messenger and Facebook started up). Why not call your friends and see them? Why chat to them on this stupid website?

Because, Mum, the way we interact with friends has changed. We don't divide ""time with friends"" and ""time away from friends"" as distinctly as we used to. Back in the 'good old days', you'd probably see your immediate community and no one else for months at a time, because the only way of communicating with people was by fucking carrier pigeon.

Now we interact with people in a far more subtle way, basically having the equivalent of huge discussion circles all the time. But apparently that's just too fetch for our Redditors.

&gt; 5) My wife is on FB so I do get some updates

And the jerk comes full circle. So he 'boycotts' Facebook, without actually boycotting Facebook at all. All for the sweet, sweet karma.

There's a few more comments that cover things like the obscene number of friends people have:

&gt; Just slowly stop using it. And text more. The people that actually care will still talk to you. Explain you're too busy for it. Eventually they'll stop seeing you on Facebook and just not notice when you delete. That's what I did. 900 people as friends and I just up and left it. No regrets.

But here's the thing: There's no mandated number of friends. You don't *have* to have 900 people on your friends list. You can have 50. Or 5. It really doesn't matter. Saying you don't use Facebook because you can interact with too many people and that that interaction loses significance is completely redundant. Facebook is just a medium. Texting would mean equally less if you never used it, or texted 500 people every day.

Finally, there's this le gem:

&gt; For the most part it is, yeah. It's presumed self importance. That is when it's not people posting the latest thing they saw on reddit and trying to pass it off as their own.

And:

&gt; I do believe you have it: uninteresting tools seem convinced they are interesting people. And FB's existence is predicated on this fact.

Two things. First, I can't believe he complains about people feeling self important, just before he complains that people steal tings from Reddit. Oh, the holy sage! They stole from him! Burn him!

Second, are you *serious*? Luckily, there's a response just below him that sums it up nicely:

&gt; I guess I understand a little more now... You're blaming Facebook for the people you know being mindless. That's like blaming paper because Glenn Beck has written books.

Boom. Case closed.

**And then there was a great flash of tin foil hats**

I'm going to keep trawling through the comments, but the highest rated reply is actually [from the OP](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12yxq7/i_still_refuse_to_watch_jay_leno_after_the/c6zbdrq):

&gt; Their slow, forced encroachment into my personal life is getting on my last nerve, and I think I'll be deleting soon.

Excuse me? What 'encroachment', and why is it 'forced'? If you don't want to upload photos, no Facebook executive is going to come around and hold a gun to your head until you do. If you don't want to put up your phone number, you don't have to (and you really shouldn't).

Lo', here lies the prophet. He stood alone against the forces of darkness, only to have their evil nefarious ways overwhelm him. Little did he know that it was not a 'Book of Face', but two faces! The first seemed innocent and inviting, filled with promises of friends and happiness, but the second sought his undoing! 'Tis a sad day to have seen his passing, but remember that ye can invest in ye Reddit Gold for ye extra benefits.

&gt; It was then when I figured how stupid it is to hand out such a subjectively and personaly valuable collection to a corporation in the first place. Not even for privacy concerns but for the simple fact, that it doesn't belong to me anyway.

This was the point at which my palm came into contact with my face. This guy doesn't even care about privacy concerns; its just that someone else 'owns' them? If the risk is that Facebook might go down, do what every prudent internet user should do: Backup, backup to a different source, then back up one last time.

If its just the gross feeling that someone else owns something of yours, grow up. Get your head out of the tin foil and realise that they're just trying to help you create and share those experiences, not steal them from you.

&gt; Not to mention things have gotten to a point where anybody without a facebook is automatically viewed with suspicion by the authorities and regular folks alike. That can't be healthy for a society.

Had I been drinking milk, I certainly would have snorted it out of my nose at that point. Instead, I guffawed loudly because bringing my hand to my forehead in a quiet sigh for my ongoing sanity.

The only reason that people would think that not having Facebook is 'suspicious' is because the people who avoid Facebook do so in a really fucking suspicious way. They talk about how corporations want to steal their souls and how they're 'giving in' to Facebook. Nobody else thinks that way, and so responds with the correct response: What?

What indeed Reddit. What indeed.

**Conclusion**

You would hope that this was a minority opinion or rare occurrence, but these comments emerge daily.

Just when you thought enormous reaction to some relatively minor changes (memes and facebook screenshots now have to be in a self post) was over... the circlejerking and butthurt in /r/atheism miraculously rises from the dead!

It has thought provoking quotes like:

&gt;There's **been a coup**. Skeen is out. New mods are in power and they've **effectively banned memes** by removing their thumbnails.

I'm fairly certain that not a single part of that is true.

&gt;What is this? Do they not realize the #1 tool for getting kids to question their faith is satire?

Apparently shitty memes and endless circlejerking so bad that it left /r/circlejerk in awe (Link:
[It's over, go home, we've been outjerked. It was a great run while it lasted](http://np.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/1fsfsl/its_over_go_home_weve_been_outjerked_it_was_a/ )) is a great satire.

&gt;Now they think we're going to click through self posts all day like a bunch of rats in a maze!

I agree. Two clicks is very burdensome for the edgy circlejerkers of /r/atheism.

&gt;This isn't some minor change. **This is a fatwa on fun!**

Internet memes are clearly a serious business.

&gt;I haven't seen such blundering abuse of elected power since ... **since STALIN!**

I agree. Mass murder is on par with getting people to put internet memes in self posts.

&gt;Well done and you worked in "" Stalin "" on cue. **up vote sir**

#

&gt;This reflects my opinions perfectly. I'm left in awe. Hopefully we get some solution to the **current crisis**.

&gt; I honestly suggest everyone who's against these changes [read this thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fvuz3/ratheism_and_the_case_against_low_effort_content/) and perhaps try to understand why the changes were made. Saying memes are banned because you are too fucking lazy to click twice is no better than the misleading shit you accuse Christians of pulling all the time. If you want to see memes, use www.reddit.com/r/atheism+AdviceAtheists from now on the problem will be solved. Only on reddit would you ever have people who think having quality discussion is a bad thing. For a subreddit that prides itself on being logical and intelligent, you all sure do act like a bunch of petulant bellends.

&gt;*Bracing for downvotes*

&gt;This sounds straight-up just like religion. Power struggles? Conversion of the youth through ""low-brow"" techniques? Small, vague phrases with enough holes that the listener fills it with the intended meaning? Deviation of ""true atheists"" from other atheists? Feel free to take your time answering my points individually (would hate to get off a gish gallop on a semi-permanent forum where you literally have months to respond), but for the love of God, look at the stuff you're posting!

&gt;I think the very fact that this creates the idea that conversion is the primary goal makes it seem even more religious. Many Christians are just as strong believers that they are trying to convert atheists and non-Christians for a good purpose: the salvation of one's soul. If r/atheism follows that track, it may as well just be ""the One religion"" and get right down in the rat race

Your IQ sure is relevant to... nothing at all actually.

&gt;[I have a high IQ, did well in highschool and now I can't even make myself do any coursework anymore and am approaching my 6th year at uni. I'm miserable because my high intelligence allowed me to get through highschool with doing jack shit and now that I'm actually being challenged I can't handle it.
Just an example, I learned to talk in under a year, was reading by the time I was 3 and had a post graduate reading level in 1st grade.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/11iiy3/til_that_being_a_gifted_high_iq_child_does_not/c6mwmiq)

You got through highschool while doing nothing? Quite the unique specimen, aren't ya?

&gt;[In elementary school my best friend and I was tested and both scored extremely high, then were whisked away into the gifted program and followed it all though out school.
Of all the friends we made in that class I can think of only one person that doesn't have or has had a drinking or drug problem. Almost all of us started using/abusing at about the same age as most child actors. My friend is an attorney, and my drinking buddy. One is a waitress at a waffle house type restaurant, another is working as a masseuse, another is an A/V guy at a local church. The list goes on and on.
Me? I'm under employed and constantly broke.
TL;DR Intelligence != success.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/11iiy3/til_that_being_a_gifted_high_iq_child_does_not/c6mrqzb)

TL;DR: Failed my life, ""high intelligence"" is the cause.

&gt;[I am ""gifted"" so I know first hand that intelligence means nothing if you don't apply it. In high school I never studied, things came easily to me and so I half assed everything and got decent grades. I get to college and in my first semester I paid dearly. Barely passed calculus and only passed the others by virtue of them being easy classes. I had no idea how to apply myself, study or work hard. People who weren't as ""smart"" as me on the IQ scale were doing astoundingly better than me.
Fortunately, my parents kept me in line but for many of my gifted friends they quickly sank. I still struggle with work ethic from time to time but intelligence only gives you the potential, you actually have to work to realize that potential.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/11iiy3/til_that_being_a_gifted_high_iq_child_does_not/c6mvb25)

3.)[Join the Army before being able to drink](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1utll)

Reddit again fails to consider the effect of alcohol on the developing brains and continues to advocate for minor to be able to get fucked up whenever they want.

4.)[All men are pedos](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1xxl7)

We're all familiar with this.  Don't really feel like I have to expand.

5.)[It's rude to call people fat](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1umal)

I should be able to call fat people fat.  I have the right to free speech and describe people as I see fit!

Judge for yourselves, but no real jerk or double standard here in my eyes.

7.) [I think it should be acceptable to hit women, for equality](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1x3os)

Equal Rights, Equal Lefts debuts in the thread.

8.) [Double standard on sexual promiscuity](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1ul3v]

Top replies are the Key/Lock analogy and the obligatory joke reply every time the double standard gets brought up.

9.)[""I want to be treated equally.. sometimes.""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1vhin)

Turns into the ""White people are discriminated against too!"" jerk with a side of ""DAE LE STEM?""

10.) [I get paid less money cause I'm a man!  Women get unfair treatment!](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1yfw2)

Instead of doing the logical thing of talking to HR about the Equal Pay Act and taking action, lets just jerk on Reddit about how discriminated against men are. 

11.) [Men shouldn't have to pay for things in a relationship](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1w15y)

This also really isn't a jerk, and I kinda misrepresented the sentiment of the post but couldn't think of a way to accurately summarize without posting the entire thing. Get's called out for not really being a double standard as top reply, and there's some good discussion on spending dynamics of relationships.  Discussion went better then expected.

12.)[Stop identifying as black, Racism is over guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1vo8k)

These minorities are clearly the racist ones here. 

13.)[Joke response involving poop](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1xvem) with pedophile joke followup

14.) [Double standard on male masturbation when it comes to sex toys](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1y3zu)

Surprised to see this here.  One of the biggest double standards when it comes to acceptance of male sexuality, in my opinion, is the attitude of sex toys.  A lot of people don't take it seriously, but there's some good follow up comment. 

15.)[I should be able to hit uppity women, also I'm discriminated against for being a dude](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca20abg)

Here's a story that both totally did happen, is told 100% without bias AND wasn't deliberately designed to rustle your jimmies.  But totes srsly women are evil harpies. 

16.)[Animals we eat are totally subjective](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1uz7v)

I've never seen this sentiment ever expressed on Reddit, no jerking here.

17.)[People don't appreciate men who provide for their children](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1vk2m)

We got its so hard to be a man and some glorious le sweeden jerks in the comments, but the parent post tried to keep it as unjerky as possible.

18.)[/r/atheism is leaking a bit](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1w1od)

19.)[Ugly people need love too](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1vge5)

Was not expecting social justice to be in this thread at all, but discrimination based on physical appearance makes the list!

20.)[Men have to get drafted and women don't](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1en6qq/what_double_standards_irritate_you/ca1wfa8)

Not going to link the rest because I'm getting tired but we have

Men can't hit women.  
I don't think black people understand equality.  
Period Joke.  
Scholarships are racist.  
Why do people think I'm creepy when pressuring women into having sex with me.  
Why is it ok to hit men?
Men should be able to lust after young women.  
Smokers get breaks?  That's not fair!  
I get discriminated against because I'm a man.  
Chivalry is discrimination  
Child Support is evil  
Male Genital Mutilation doesn't get enough press  
Not hiring white people is discrimination  
Drunk people can totally consent, its not fair!  
I can't call people fat  
Why can't I hit women  
Joke about fucking goats  
Why can't black people be racist?  
Affirmative Action is oppressing me. 


So I was going to tally up the jerks and have charts and graphs and add more sarcastic commentary under each linked post, but now I'm super tired and going to bed.  For now he's a documentation of the all the jerks at the top of the thread, and I pray that will be enough for now.

Someone lays out why quickmeme is evil and why we shouldn't support them. Included in this:

&gt;...they are profiteering businessmen who have never coded in their lives, dont participate in the community here, dont follow what memes are new, and dont give two shits about memes. They just want money, period.

These people are TRYING TO MAKE MONEY! By running a website! How can you support this!?

&gt;they slip viruses and malware into their site sometimes

according to a yahoo answers screenshot, always the most reliable source on the internet

&gt; just to make more money, then pretend it was an ""accident"" when they get caught 

They even do it on purpose. We know this because they're evil and not coders!

&gt;They paid some guy in India named Shah Pavel Jamal like 500 bucks to design and set up their entire site, and now they sit on their asses and make money off all his hard work while he sits in some slum and makes nothing.

They outsourced work! I've never purchased anything produced for cheap outside of the US/Canada, and never will!

&gt;Incredibly, they are also planning to launch a competitor to reddit and throw the entire weight of quickmeme behind it

Competition is bad! Never EVER support competition

&gt;I quit quickmeme and picked livememe simply cuz the creator uses reddit and made a chrome extension which adds an ""add captions"" link directly onto anything on Adviceanimals, which works for me because i'm lazy as fuck.

It doesn't matter what the creators of livememe are like, as long as its easy and i'm ignorant to any of their wrongdoings, its great in my book!


Then we have, at the time of posting sitting at 219 points:

&gt;Downvote all quickmeme links!

I thought this was a joke until I saw the user start to argue why it 'made sense' and its absurd.

&gt;As long as they see its getting downvoted, they'll have more evidence that using quickmeme is bad, rather than just having an internet stranger tell them so

I know when I'm getting downvoted my first thought is whether or not people like my image hosting site.

The original post is bad enough, but the fact that hundreds of people agree that for simply using a website they don't like, people should be downvoted.

It is the image macro equivalent of the ""what's some unpopular opinions that everyone on this site has"" threads you see on /r/AskReddit. A chance for everyone to gather around and pat each other on the back for going against the norm, which is already everyone's favorite thing to do here anyway.

Well today, Confession Bear leaves us not just [one gem](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/156utp/i_know_this_will_be_unpopular_but_i_cant_hold_it/), but a follow-up gem to go with it.

&gt;I know this will be unpopular, but I can't hold it in any longer

Oh man, buckle up folks, this could be good. Could it be a condemnation of anti-dialogue bullying from /r/atheism? Or maybe how /r/politics exclusively features only one side of every issue? HA! Those would actually be unpopular opinions, silly!

&gt;I HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT BEING IN THE ARMY. THEY SIGNED UP FOR IT, THEY ARE GETTING PAID FOR IT, THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GETTING INTO

Now let's see, why would this be a popular opinion on reddit? The easy answer would be the user base's left-leaning political views, but I don't believe (most) liberals appreciate the sacrifice of military men and women any less than conservatives. I think it goes a little deeper than that.

It's been said before that redditors must hate anything their Facebook friends like, even if they previously liked that thing themselves (see Gangnam Style, rage comics, pretty much any meme that's crossed into the mainstream). Well, the military's no different. Most people would agree that, even though they are getting paid and they signed up for it, military members do still sacrifice a great deal and put their asses on the line for us and thusly are deserving of our respect. If these redditors posted the same anti-military rant to Facebook, they know they would be chastised by most of their friends, so instead they come here where like-minded individuals can discuss how oppressed their opinions are. To the comments!

In the top comment, a military member gives his seal of approval to the thread, thereby validating anything negative anyone's about to say. One user points out that military members have the right to bitch about their job just like anyone else, followed by another user who reminds us that being in the military really *isn't that hard*.

&gt;[But we're expected to act extremely sympathetic towards them. If you're working at pizza hut and say ""damn this job sucks. I hate making pizzas"" then people would look at you and say ""well then get a new job"" or ""yeah working sucks"". But with the military its all ""You're our heroes! Thank you! I can't believe you are drug into this world!"" We're expected to act as if the job they do isn't just a job, but rather something superhuman](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/156utp/i_know_this_will_be_unpopular_but_i_cant_hold_it/c7jvv9c)

You heard the man, folks, why should we be any more grateful to the guy who leaves his family for extended periods of time to get shot at in a foreign country than we are to the guy who *cooks our pizza*. Y'know, I should do a Confession Bear meme, cause I've got an unpopular opinion: this guy probably works at Pizza Hut, or a similar low-income job, because that seems to be the group that complains the most about this issue. ""Hhmph, why does *he* get all the credit just cause he's in the military. My job's hard too y'know!"" Actually, never mind, I've got precious link karma to protect.

&gt;[What about the garbage collectors, fishermen, loggers, or any of the other professions more dangerous than the military? They make comfortable, civilized life possible for us; why are they not afforded the same god-like status?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/156utp/i_know_this_will_be_unpopular_but_i_cant_hold_it/c7jw6c7)

If your job is particularly dangerous, companies will almost always throw a whole lotta extra on top to make the work a bit more enticing. There was an AMA on here a few days ago with a high school dropout who now makes six figures working on an oil rig. Do you think he makes all of that because working on an oil rig is particularly hard or that it required years of training? No, it's because his job is fucking dangerous. As for the respect factor, I don't know, I can't imagine why people have high degrees of respect for people whose job it is to get shot at by terrorists either. Really, I'm stumped. 

The thread's a real winner, but I'm gonna cut it short for a little bonus coverage! This thread got its own [""girl version""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/157kx9/i_know_this_will_be_unpopular_but_i_cant_hold_it/) as well!

&gt;I HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR WOMEN WHO MARRY MILITARY MEN AND COMPLAIN HE IS NEVER THERE. THEY AGREED TO IT, THEY ARE BEING TAKEN CARE OF BY THEM, THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GETTING INTO

That's right boys and girls, not only should military members feel bad for complaining about being in the military, but their families need to go ahead and shut the fuck up about how much they miss them already. Fucking military wives, if you didn't wanna miss him so much, MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP BEING SO IN LOVE WITH HIM.

The top comment points out how arrogant and insensitive it is to criticize people for missing their families. A commenter points out that he encounters these annoying military families trying to get military discounts at restaurants. After some jerking, we have:

&gt;[Why give military people a discount at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/157kx9/i_know_this_will_be_unpopular_but_i_cant_hold_it/c7k1mas)

Followed closely by:

&gt;[I agree. By that logic, everyone with a dangerous occupation should get discounts.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/157kx9/i_know_this_will_be_unpopular_but_i_cant_hold_it/c7k1qwd)

More ""being in the military isn't that hard"" jerking! Of course!

As many people in both threads pointed out, you ARE allowed to complain about something you signed up for. In late April and early December, when every post on here is bitching about studying for finals, it's interesting that I've never seen someone say ""WELL WHAT ARE YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT, YOU DON'T *HAVE* TO BE IN COLLEGE Y'KNOW!"" But it's nice to see that a brave soul finally brought this issue to light. If I had to see another Facebook friend talking about the respect they had for military families, particularly during arguably the toughest time of the year for them, the holiday season, I was gonna vomit.

Happy Holidays, /r/circlebroke!

EDIT: it's been brought to my attention that garbage collectors do in fact have dangerous careers. Pardon my ignorance but once again, everybody likes hazard pay.

Never mind that we're not the rarest type (that's INFJ).  The INTPs are the architects, the scientists, the *atheists*.  INTPs will wear you down with our logic and natural intelligence. We're the best, and we know it.

For the uninitiated among you (the sad overwhelming masses who are not lucky &amp; brave enough to be INTPs), here is an introduction to the beautiful world of [r/INTP](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/).

---


**Intelligence:** We INTPs can all agree that we are of [above average intelligence](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/tqmmz/how_many_of_you_feel_you_are_above_average/). Why? Because [overthinking things is a sign of intelligence](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/tqmmz/how_many_of_you_feel_you_are_above_average/c4qg4j1)! 

Unfortunately, the original post (by potentially-not-INTP southernlights) contains a couple fatal flaws: first, he uses grades as a measure of intelligence.* [They so aren't!](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/tqmmz/how_many_of_you_feel_you_are_above_average/c4p1je9) But [standardized](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/tqmmz/how_many_of_you_feel_you_are_above_average/c4owq5c) [tests](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/tqmmz/how_many_of_you_feel_you_are_above_average/c4p1z8w) [are](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/tqmmz/how_many_of_you_feel_you_are_above_average/c4p0yzj). For example, whereas ForeverJames's 'study habits and work ethic is [sic] atrocious', he's met only a handful of people who can meet his 'ability to process information'; oh, and by the way? [homeboy has an IQ of 145](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/tqmmz/how_many_of_you_feel_you_are_above_average/c4oycs3). Go INTPs!

Another problem with southernlights' post is that he admits to *feeling*. colorblindboy and dexxter67 are [quick to remind us](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/tqmmz/how_many_of_you_feel_you_are_above_average/c4oxjj7) that INTPs don't have *feelings*; that's the stuff of artists and theists. Rather, INTPs only *think* and *know*.

**Exclusivity:** Which brings me to another important cornerstone of the INTP fortress. As dexxter67 reminded us above, if you find yourself using the verb 'to feel', you may want to take that personality assessment again. Darwin forbid any INFPs invade the INTP camp! dexxter67, to his credit, can proudly proclaim that '[personally I never write that I feel, because I don't, I think](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/tqmmz/how_many_of_you_feel_you_are_above_average/c4p9gz9)'. 

Why does the INTP community have to guard so preciously its gates? Because [we are literally the fucking bee's knees](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/uhda1/dea_else_secretly_or_not_so_secretly_think_they/). 

But, as the great INFP (so close!) Shakespeare once said, 'Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown' (*Henry IV: Part Two*, 3.1.31). With great power comes great responsibility. intplams wonders whether '[the INTP mind \[is\] created as a result of some kind of early trauma](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/uero5/is_the_intp_mind_created_as_a_result_of_some_kind/)', because he has been 'reading lots of old eastern philosophy and it seems they equate intelligence with pain'. Lots of INTPs also have [messed up sleep patterns](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/uhcmu/dae_have_ridiculously_messed_up_sleeping_patterns/), because we just think too goddamn much!

**INTP feeemales:** It can be concluded that, based on [hollywoodending's research](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/i0p66/intp_females/), 'we are a rare breed'.  As such, INTP females are deserving of especial reverence.  wombat_jones demonstrates: 'Holy crap, you're the .001 percent of the .001 percent. And here I felt isolated being an INTP guy. Good luck on your search!' That's right, female INTPs!  You are the .001% of the .001% (or the 10^-8 %--or [1-3% of the population](http://www.capt.org/mbti-assessment/estimated-frequencies.htm)).

As a follow-up, hollywoodending graciously posted an [IAmA](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/t53cm/i_am_a_female_intp_ama/), allowing male INTPs to pick the rare flower that is her ladybrain. These girls are so logical and so unemotional that [they're often mistaken for lesbians](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/t53cm/i_am_a_female_intp_ama/c4jngdp) (which, as we all know, is halfway to being a man)! But there's trouble brewing in the INTPladynest: INTP female meh_reddit (I know, right!) takes umbrage with the suggestion that INTPs might be disturbing females' biologically determined societal roles; like a true INTPsister, she lays down the law with [some biotruths](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/t53cm/i_am_a_female_intp_ama/c4jnxeg).

It's hard being an INTP, there's no denying it. Not only are we exceedingly intelligent and very rare, but our keen analytical skills come at the expense of social skills.  That's why we retreat to the comfort of our subreddit where we may masturbate in peace. Any INTPs in the crowd are welcome to join us.

I'm not defending him, I'm simply pointing out he was the lesser of two evils.

&gt;Considering the difference between Assad regime and with the behavior of the rebels, I think the Assad dude wasn't so bad after all.

Yes, let's ignore the fact that the Syrian civil war started off as peaceful protests, and only escalated after Assad massacred the protesters in the streets.

&gt;On a high horse much? I look at the amount of control conspiracy nuts have in the Republican party, and I have no doubt that if the US government collapsed, right-wing militias would start waging war on minorities and non-christians.

Since we're talking about Syria, it's very important we get reminded how America is bad.

&gt;wher are the western papers on this?
they were all to eager to talk about assad and what he did, even showed pictures of iraq and claimed assad did it.

The only source reporting this story is the Iranian state run media.  So that obviously means that all Western media sources are trying to cover it up.  Because if you can't trust the Iranian media, who can you trust?  Besides, you know this story is unbiased when it includes passages like this:

&gt;""In October 2011, calm was almost restored in the Arab state after President Assad started a reform initiative in the country, but Israel, the US and its Arab allies sought hard to bring the country into chaos through any possible means.

If it's a picture of a fat redditor guy people won't mention anything about it(not complaining, that's a good thing), but if it's a picture of an overweight woman, MAN THE HARPOONS.

And then there are all the wonderful posts that are simply a facebook picture album of a woman who reddit thinks looks weird or ugly. Hah! Take that, women! That's what you get for friendzoning me!

It just annoys me so much. Bullying is so fucking awful, it's such a massive problem and statistically, a large percentage of redditors have been negatively affected by it. Why do they all feel that it's ok to bully other people once they're behind a computer screen? That they can make other people feel the way they did?

To put it into a bit of perspective, imagine this is facebook, and everybody is 16 years old. Imagine you know the woman in the picture(let's just pretend she's 16 too). And somebody in your school uploads the picture with that title. Would you feel ok liking the picture?

[Community Past vs Community Present](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/151rnq/how_do_you_believe_the_demise_of_reddit_will_come/c7ij9lf). 

Here are a couple of my own questions and thoughts.

- It seems like threads like these tend to signal the beginning of the end, don't they? There's no more question about **if** Reddit will die but rather **when**. Now, in this thread I'm posting about, we are seeing people look for the reason. The degradation of quality is a great example. I think that Reddit will eventually lose the majority of the traffic that just quickly hits the defaults and leaves. They will be bored of the same tired joke and the complete lack of humor in /r/funny or the same facebook pwnage in /r/atheism.

- However, we should also consider another popular site that was ""bogged down by shitposting"" like 4chan. That site has been up for YEARS, and they're still going strong (I think the next GET on /b/ is something like 444444444). Will Reddit follow suit?

- What triggered the main Reddit userbase to go from helpful to asshole? The response of ""OP is a faggot"" has become popular, and that shit was already old on /b/ when people *first* started saying it on Reddit. Is it a younger or more immature userbase as suggested [here?](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/151rnq/how_do_you_believe_the_demise_of_reddit_will_come/c7iiw3k)",Good Meta,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_152mq1,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/152mq1/wow_im_loving_this_askreddit_thread_and_you_might/,

The first thing that strikes me about this thread is how much of a waste of time it is. Is anyone confused about how fucked up the American adoption system is? No? Okay. At first, it looks as if OP is just here to farm some of that delicious comment karma, but it get's so much better.

I applaud their use of caution. Everyone knows exactly where this is going, but somebody's gotta pull the trigger eventually.

OP's response:

&gt;[I am 100% for it. Being in foster care, I see that there are far too many children in the system \(around 550,000 in the US alone\). There aren't enough prospective adoptive parents, so most children end up like me, living in the system, or reunited with their parents who are still just as awful. It's not any kind of quality life.

Did he really say ""social stigma""? Really? I'm sorry, but did I just step back into the 1950s? I get that abortion still isn't hip here in amerikka like it is over in LE S[WEED]EN but there's also the whole ""NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW"" part of that. Unless you go around telling people, ""hey I had an abortion."", chances are nobody will ever find out. Unless you somehow put yourself in the position to be outed, I think you'll be fine. 

But wait, there's more.

It just isn't a proper jerk without a fundies attack.

But this is the best line from the whole IAMA. The pinnacle of the jerk. The point where everyone in the thread collectively orgasms together and Kleenex's stock jumps 20% instantly.

The pro-birth comment, however, starts a chain reaction of orgasmic pleasure that ripples though the thread.

&gt;""I'm making it a bumper sticker""

Yeah bro, you can put it next to your ""COEXIST"", marriage equality, and Barack Obama 2012 stickers

&gt;""Always thought this. First time I heard it put so succinctly""

&gt;""I will forever use this point when arguing against pro-lifers""

No you won't, because you'll never have the opportunity to have civilized human discourse with anyone but your landlord/mother, the wal-mart cashier, and the cable guy.

I'll admit that thread is at least timely as it lands on the anniversary of the event.

However, of course that dark anniversary is only the penumbra of a truly evil day. I refer of course to July 4th the founding of 'murica, torture, and all bad things in the world. We all know that on this day 99% of all American redditors celebrate by torturing people, being fat, shooting dogs, and being blissfully unaware of how much better LITERALLY EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD IS than our country.

So to make sure everyone is educated about that fact some poor brave redditor who I'm sure thought, ""I know I'll get downvoted for this, but..."" posted [a thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1hmj0a/til_a_german_citizen_was_mistakenly_abducted_by/) to remind us that 'Murica is not in fact perfect.

Now the USA has made mistakes, many of them actually, but reddit clearly lacks any context for world affairs that might make this a useful and interesting discussion. So let's just go ahead and dive head first into this scum pool;

&gt;And it works. Look at all the threads on Snowden recently. Any criticism of the US / NSA / Spying policies has been met with floods of Americans rushing in to tell everyone that the rest of the world has done some bad shit historically and that, here's a great leap of logic, because the US government is doing something (in this case PRISM), it's likely that everyone else is doing the same or worse than them.

Yes there's certainly no pro-Snowden on reddit.

&gt;And do you think they give a fuck? Nope. They welcome all the crazies they can create that way they can continue to fight the war against the shit they create. The real war is against us. We're the target, the terrorists are just an excuse... Same way Communism was the excuse until '91. New boogie man was needed.

The CIA did this so they could fight U.S. citizens!!!!!

&gt;I am this close to becoming a terrorist and I'm from the US!!

Once he realized that he can't wear a fedora and be a terrorist at the same time, I'm sure this sentiment will dry up.

&gt;Well, the USA is the biggest terrorist country in the world. No surprises there..

This, is amazing.... I don't even.....

&gt;     

So extrajudicial murder apparently isn't a big deal anymore for the US government because you know, 9/11. When will we wake up and realize America has become a totalitarian state?

&gt;For all Americans out there: don't throw your vote away next time on some asshole from the establishment and seriously consider voting for a third party candidate. 

We are literally living in the Soviet Union..... and only RON PAUL can help.

&gt;General Aladeen: Why are you guys so anti-dictators? Imagine if America was a dictatorship. You could let 1% of the people have all the nation's wealth. You could help your rich friends get richer by cutting their taxes. And bailing them out when they gamble and lose. You could ignore the needs of the poor for health care and education. Your media would appear free, but would secretly be controlled by one person and his family. You could wiretap phones. You could torture foreign prisoners. You could have rigged elections. You could lie about why you go to war. You could fill your prisons with one particular racial group, and no one would complain. You could use the media to scare the people into supporting policies that are against their interests.

With some bonus fuck those richies sentiment.

&gt;No sir, I don't hate USA, I hate the gang of lying-lawless-prepotent-authoritarian-psychopaths that rule that place.

&gt;Its citizens are quite a charming group, actually.
&gt;&gt;No they aren't.

&gt;Just for all the Americans reading this, I don't think you understand what the world opinion of your country really is. The US is not described as a friend, or a beacon of hope for the world, but instead as a bully, with an insatiable desire to control, and profit, from all that lay below it (ie, the rest of the world).

&gt;At first glance, it's as if the US believes that it has the 'God given right,' or in fact, 'duty,' to hand out 'freedom,' and 'democracy,' to all, but it's when countries choose to have the wrong sort of freedom, and America decides to dish out a second serve of justice and stability, that it becomes clear that you do everything in your power to expand your own power, and wealth, at any expense to other states or individuals, as long as there is some plausible deniability, or means to manufacture an excuse for your actions.

&gt;I know that your government could, if it wanted to, make myself, or almost any other citizen of my country disappear within a day, or two at most, but that really isn't too special, there are, after all, quite a number of countries that could do the same. What scares me is that you government could then 'decide,' that my own government would turn a blind eye to anything that could link the US to my disappearance. (Whether the necessary disguised threats and intimidation has already occurred, or threats are made on a case to case basis is both up for debate, and irrelevant)

&gt;Ah, anyway, I've just heard something outside, I'll send this now, and go check out whatever's going on. I'll edit the rest in in a minute! Probably another fucking possawresthju6ir7tl80

We all know that Americans on reddit a blissfully unaware that the rest of the Americans on reddit don't like America. Also huehuehuehuehue that was kidnapping joke.

Yep of course that has 90 upvotes.

&gt;My hate for the American government keeps growing and growing. My sympathy for the American people keeps shrinking and shrinking. Land of the free and of the brave they say? I see nobody there being either. 

&gt;indeed. this one gets picked up monthly. On the other hand it is a necessary reminder how far the arms of the US ""justice"" reaches and how indistinguishable it became with sheer terrorism.

&gt;Pew claims that it's ""non-partisan"" but that's bullshit. It's very partisan to the National Security State and can't be trusted to be an honest dealer on issues like this.
The president's bio of the Pew Research Center reads like the career of a mass media propagandist:
http://www.pewresearch.org/experts/alan-murray/[1]
Alan Murray has been president of the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., since January 2013. He previously spent 29 years at The Wall Street Journal, where he most recently served as Deputy Managing Editor and Executive Editor, Online. Murray spent a decade as the Journal’s Washington Bureau Chief, during which the bureau won three Pulitzer Prizes; and he subsequently served as CNBC’s Washington Bureau Chief, co-hosting “Capital Report with Alan Murray and Gloria Borger.” At various times, he wrote the Journal’s weekly Business and Political Capital columns, and won numerous awards for his writing on economics and international issues. He is the author of four books, including Showdown at Gucci Gulch, coauthored with Jeffrey Birnbaum. He was a Morehead Scholar at the University of North Carolina, a Luce scholar, and holds a master’s degree in economics from the London School of Economics. He is a member of the Gridiron Club and the Council on Foreign Relations, and serves on the Governing Council of the Miller Center for Public Affairs at the University of Virginia.

Well, guys, I guess Pew is bullshit conspiracy fodder by Reddit standards. Oh but what if Pew is talking about Mitt Romney, taxes and Marijuana legalization? Well then by confirmation bias standards Pew is credible. In fact, they're front page credible!

Here is a [search of Pew polls] (http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/search?q=pew+poll&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all) posted on Reddit. Little to no one's surprise, if you put them in descending order, data is perceived as neutral and fair if it conforms with Reddit's preexisting belief set. 

Now here's where the fun starts. No shit Reddit falls victim to the confirmation bias phenomenon. No the real humor starts with the **absolute certainty** that everyone is on their side. Let's examine some threads:

You couldn't ask for better contradiction when compared to polling. Let's continue:

&gt;Shhhhhhhhh, go back to sleep people. Look, here is a ""poll"" we conducted that shows a majority of people are actually okay with this so nothing to see here. Back to sleep now, there there shhhhhhhhhhhh.

It just assumes a distinct paranoia that polling data cannot be trusted on this issue. Relax, the numbers are fixed. We're actually an overwhelming majority on this issue.

And heeere we go! The finale. What poll are Redditors now endorsing? [Rasmussen](http://np.www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1g4sgo/majority_of_americans_okay_with_nsa_dragnet_or/). Know anything about Rasmussen? They're commonly regarded as a Republican polling center. And Reddit *HATES* Rasmussen when it disagrees with them. 

Rasmussen on Net Neutrality: [""Rasmussen gives bullshit survey, finds only 21% of people support their distorted, misleading version of net neutrality.](http://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/euo0p/rasmussen_gives_bullshit_survey_finds_only_21_of/)

&gt;Funny - the little blurbs running in the banner ad on the page include this gem, ""Rasmussen has become a driving force in American politics.""
They don't even pretend to be something other than a push-poll pusher, and if you look at the leading questions they used in this particular poll, you realize that creating public perception is their game, not reflecting it.

Well there you have it. When Rasmussen supports them, they're neutral. When they're against them, they're shaping public opinion.

Now, the article in question does not give the dead mans side of the story and as reddit only reads titles you can see where this is going.

Sitting at a solid +600

&gt;As a former grad student I can say this was justified.

Nice! A typical redditism that has the added value of condoning murder.

This ones my favorite because it sums up the article, which no one read.

&gt;Here is how it ends
Convicted of second degree murder. Sentenced to seven years in prison in 1978. Released in September 1985.
Upon his release in 1985, he said, ""I have no intention of killing again. On the other hand, I cannot predict the future.""
He does not regard himself as a threat. ""I killed for notoriety,"" he explained ""If I kill again, it weakens my argument.""

I'm not condoning this, but I am condoning this.

&gt;I'm not saying I agree this was justified, but I do wish more people would understand the psychological damage this sort of thing can do to someone. Let's compare this to the trauma of getting raped. Although it's impossible to know for sure, I'm willing to bet this student has suffered just as much, if not more than many rape victims. I know I'd rather get raped in some dark ally somewhere than to go through what this guy went through.
Whenever we hear stories of rape, reddit is always out for blood. But what about those of us who are suffering just as much as rape victims? Someone can psychologically torment someone else for years and completely destroy their life, but if the victim isn't a young innocent female, people just don't seem to care.

[Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bjysv/a_legitimate_question_about_reddit_and_4chan/) an askreddit thread two years ago where a brave redditer asks The Hivemind on why they hate 4chan so much.

NOTE: He asks about **4chan, not /b/.**

Top comment:

&gt;The majority of people on reddit visit 4chan, are ashamed of it, and try to pretend they don't. Some of it is an attempt at self-deprecating humor, some is people trying to pretend they don't really visit 4chan.

Makes sense. Stuff you see on the front page of certain subreddits come straight out of 4chan.

Here comes the Hivemind:

&gt;I don't have the patience to sift through 4chan. I rely on reddit to do it for me.

""Luckily that's only a picture. I'm too scared to go there myself"". This is what's wrong with reddit. Just click and move on.

&gt;4chan is like Skeleton Jelly and Reddit has evolved to almost chimpanzee status. Why go screaming around like a zombie when you can have a banana and smile.

So what he's saying is that reddit is more civilised and evolved than 4chan? The rest of the replies to top comment bring more reddit &gt; 4chan circlejerking.

Let's move on to other parent comments, shall we?

&gt;I wasn't previously aware of this, but I must be in the minority that doesn't even visit 4chan, much less /b/.
Don't get me wrong, I've checked it out to see what all the fuss is about -- but it all seemed incredibly disorganized to me. I'm not anywhere near OCD and I have little to no organization anywhere in my life, but 4chan seemed somewhat haphazard to me.
That, and everything there seemed like some twisted bastard child of a James Joyce/Pedobear one night stand.

____________________________________________________________

&gt;The issue is that 85-90% of the content on /b/ is porn (underage, chubby, furry, penis posts, etc.), gore, profanity, boxxy, triforcing, Rule 34ing, moot-bashing, racism, and other nonsense. Sometimes it happens to be that some good material comes from there, so people post them and receive upvotes. I guarantee if I posted the first 20 photos I saw on /b/ right now, I would be banned from Reddit.
EDIT: Changed ""content on 4Chan"" to ""content on /b/""

These people never even visited the other boards.


There are people who defend 4chan, but in a sort of backhanded way:

&gt;Our 4chan/Reddit relationship is like fingering your butthole while masturbating. Whenever mentioned you're going to deny and be disgusted by it. But every night, when no one is around...

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

&gt;I used to visit 4chan and I used to enjoy it, but the amount of CP that was popping up all over the place was making me feel physically sick. Plus, and I don't want to sound like an old-fart, but some of the /b/tards actions are disgusting. I always pictured /b/ like this:
A stadium filled with /b/tards, each with a bucket of rocks. Their victim would be on the field while the /b/tards threw the rocks from the stands. However, one of the /b/tards falls onto the field and instead of helping them back into the seating area they begin to throw the rocks at them too.
At least with Reddit there is a sense of unity, and not just anarchy.

You can tell this person has never went outside of /b/. Also, that quote has very strong irony in it. 

Plenty of comments with:

* /b/ = 4chan.

* Only pedos are on 4chan.

* 4chan is filled with sick internet bullies. *cough*, /r/atheism, *cough*


Thank you for reading. I'm going to conclude with this:

We start off with a token, ""Swedish = Atheism and all things cool"" statement. OP tries very little to keep it subtle at all.

&gt;As an atheist (i.e. a Swede)

Fucking amazing, brah, but nobody gives a shit. Especially since it adds zero to the post.

&gt; So I recently started reading a little. After just a handful of pages, I've seen some shit.

""I probably looked deep into old /r/atheism history to see what parts I can cherry pick.""

But It goes a little worse than that. Without keeping in mind any account of historical context, deeper meaning, poetic **Metaphorical** literature or anything like that, are ever so brilliant OP just goes right off the bat at the first few sentences he reads.

&gt;God creates man AND woman out of the dust of the Earth. Then on the next page, the man is suddenly alone again and God creates woman from his rib. Self-contradiction right out of the gate.

Oh my God...I think that this guy just taught me that the bible is full of shit! Its says God created man and woman...and then it says that God then created man first, then woman! Oh Lord he may be onto something!/s But in reality, maybe it was, you know, stating that God created man and woman but he created man first then Woman.

&gt;God says ""Let US make humankind in OUR image, according to OUR likeness"". Wait, I thought there was only ONE God according to the bible? The ""majestic plural"" crossed my mind, but that isn't used anywhere else

Taking things literally makes a lot of things easier to refute. By this logic and reading comprehension, the story ""Incident at Owl Creek Bridge"" would be about a guy who escaped from a hanging and the Troops that were after him **LITERALLY** ran to his house and rigged the entrance with a weak bridge and a noose that the protagonist would slip into. Also, he would go back in time as well and die.

&gt;God tells the humans to ""be fruitful and multiply"". And then there's the Song of Songs, which is basically erotic poetry. Sooo... what's the problem with sexuality, again?

""All Christians are against having sex and orgasms even though a lot of them have children. Christians are against everything that I find fun, regardless, since its Christianity!""

&gt;(Noah) took one each of all the ""clean animals"" and sacrificed them to God by burning them. Dafuq? You just saved them!

I mean, lets disregard the fact that God kind of saved Noah's ass as well from drowning, but whatever wins you argument points.

&gt;Lot.. Jeez.. He lived in a cave with his daughters, and since the daughters didn't get any male visitors in that cave, the daughters instead got their father drunk and had sex with him, so as to became [*sic*] pregnant. Nice.

The bible clearly states that what the girls did was a horrible sin, but like he says a couple times, he's skimming to parts that can be taken out of context and made to seem horrible.

&gt;I didn't even read much yet, and I didn't choose specific dark parts or anything, I just read a couple of random chapters in the beginning of the book.

Need I say more. ""I just casually went to the dark parts by *complete coincidence*.""

First time posting and the first time I really lost it with /r/atheism today. After taking 4 years of religion class, the rebuttal that OP proposed made me want to kick a kitten in the face. Its nice that at least its something that does cause *discussion* (relatively speaking). The new rules have helped, but this post still reeks of awful ratheism. This is probably a good sneak peek into what a lot of /r/atheism posts will be like. Out of Context, rebuttal without substance, and token ""I'm swede which means I'm atheistic and kewl"".

Marijuana is the key to curing your addiction!,Maharbal217,204,41,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1dwwlu/group_therapy_counselling_rehabilitation_centers/,"Disclaimer: One of my parents is an alcoholic and many of my family members and friends struggle from this disease. So just be warned that this is going to color my opinion of this matter.

I was browsing /r/WTF when I came across this image: http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1dv9y2/my_room_mate_went_to_the_hospital_last_week_for/. Now growing up in an alcoholic household this image really hit me hard, basically it was just a flashback to my childhood of finding bottles like this stashed around my house. I was looking through the comments, many of which were highly constructive begging those in OP's, and his roommate's, situation to seek professional help. Well everyone except the top comment:
&gt;I'm going to be that guy that points out that cannabis is still criminally illegal but drinking 12 litres of vodka, perfectly legal.

Uhhh . . . ok? Not really on topic but really the pro-weed circlejerk comes up any time the negative effects of alcohol come up. Basically par for the course at this point. It's when we get a little deeper that things take a serious turn for the worse:
&gt;Time to discover marijuana.
Small edit: I myself got to the point of 1 bottle of jack per night. Started taking shots in the parking lot at work, started taking shots before work. Roomates got me to smoke up, I no longer care to drink nearly as often and it goes many weeks before I even pour myself a beverage to enjoy. Its been about 3 years since those days and I cant even recall the last time I was drunk. Regardless though, this probably shouldnt be taken as advice at all

Alright now this is just fucking ridiculous. Not only does he start by telling OP to start smoking, then proceeding to tell a story about how is alcoholism was miraculously ""cured"" by the sweet sweet powers of the Devil's Lettuce, but then ends the whole thing on ""yeah you really probably shouldn't listen to this advice."" Ok if you don't want people to listen to the advice, then don't give the advice. But things just get worse from here on out.
&gt;This. I have a friend with a horrible drinking problem. Multiple arrests, jobs lost, friends abandoning him. He started being a pothead and quit drinking and now he is functioning again.

""Yeah srs bro, my friend totally was an alcoholic until he discovered W33D and its saganesque powers. Now he's totally functional in society.""

&gt;You know the true way to break addiction is to actively moderate it. A progressive approach to things like addiction can saves lives and enrich them.

Yep! Functioning alcoholism is great and totally OK! Shit it actually SAVES LIVES! Doesn't matter if you're dependent on a substance. Doesn't matter if you're harming those around you. So long as you're not going too far overboard you're fine!

&gt;I found with some of my family members that struggled with alcohol and other addictions that they can even substitute their addiction with religion and AA ( not saying that's the case for everyone) and then become sober alcoholics; maintaining the same disposition and compulsion as try had before.

Ok this is where I started getting really, really angry. I'm no doctor, but growing up around people who struggle with alcoholism I can very safely say that THERE IS NO WAY TO CURE ALCOHOLISM. It doesn't matter if you smoke 81 blunts a day, once you become an alcoholic there is no turning back. Honestly guys this is exactly why the first step in most 12 step programs is to admit to yourself that you are an alcoholic. This means that you have to realize that you will never be able to drink again. I've seen so many people in my life return to alcohol because they listen to idiots like this. It doesn't matter if you smoke instead of drink, you are still an alcoholic.

&gt;I agree 200%! I stopped drinking as much and started smoking more. Not only did I save money but I lost a ton of weight. I have been to AA but they are all about abstinence and fuck that. So I want to ""self medicate"", so what? That is my choice. The ability to choose the lesser of those evils should be my option.
I remember going to my mothers house and her saying ""Are you high? OMG etc, etc."" ""Would you rather me be drunk?"" She has never said anything else. Biggest issue now are drug tests. They should be lucky I am not hiding alcohol in the cooler or stealing from the bar anymore.

Ok? This guy's lack of self awareness is awe inspiring, truly awe inspiring. Yeah AA is all about abstinence but fuck that, I can quit drinking without abstaining from drinking. All I need to do is blaze it up! Doesn't matter that I'm so psychologically dependent on this substance **THAT I HAVE TO SMOKE BEFORE I VISIT MY OWN MOTHER**, I'm totally fine! Seriously guys! Totally fine!

It goes on like this for a while, and I'll admit that there are definitely voices of reason in these comments. But seriously guys, OP's roommate has a deep and serious drinking problem, this goes way beyond a minor college drinking. He needs help, not weed, real professional help. It's idiots like these that keep people from finding the help they need. Weed is not the fucking cure to everything, if it was people wouldn't fall off the wagon half as often as they do.

Alcoholism stole a great deal of my childhood, and ruined many of the relationships I had with my family, and maybe this biases me a little bit. But I just get mad, and I mean mad, when I see ignorant comments like these. Most of these neckbeards don't understand just how serious drinking problems like these are.

If you guessed ""Breaking Bad reference,"" you're a stupid idiot who should've known better. A throwaway Breaking Bad reference is only the SECOND (and fourth, and fifth, and sixth, and seventh...) most immediate piece of nonsense that reddit can think to say about this issue. 

The first most important, most relevant, most visible, and highly contributive piece of information about this news is, of course, a sarcastic one-liner about how dangerous it is to post about US news in the ""world news"" subreddit, because the MODS will get you! Because THAT is the issue of our time, folks - the nazi mods of r/worldnews refusing to allow us to spam the entire front page of the sub with US-related news. 

&gt;Watch out! The mods of /r/worldnews will get you for it only being in the US.

And now for the gilding of the lily....

&gt;Fuck those cunts. For us non-US citizens, US news is world news.

Give 'em gold, boys! 

As you move further down the comment threads, you'll find that it's literally impossible to express any other sentiment than ""Breaking Bad, Breaking Bad, ricin was in Breaking Bad, did anyone notice that they used ricin in Breaking Bad and this news headline mentions ricin? Ricin ricin Jesse ricin Lily of the Valley Tuco ricin Breaking BAD HAHA I'M RELEVANT.""

Sandwiched between 10,000 BB references is a comment that is almost borderline relevant, from someone who knows someone who is an aide to the senator, but has absolutely no substantial information to contribute. And that's as good as it gets.

Reddit's comment sections are like the comment sections of every other stupid mainstream publication on the internet, except worse, because they get upvoted and gilded, rewarding banal, predictable, lowest-common-denominator behavior with money, prominence, and a total lack of self-awareness.

We all know that nobody even reads the articles anymore, they just go straight to the comments. People love to boast about that, even, as though it is something to be proud of. So what does that mean for the average redditor? That means they're first reaction to reading a headline is to reduce the issue to whatever ridiculous reddit drama the nazi mods are eroding our civil liberties with, followed by every conceivable Breaking Bad reference there is. That's the extent of reddit's coverage of this issue. Headline, diversion to subreddit drama, daytime television reference. 

Who needs the lamestream media, right guys? We have reddit! We get all the unbiased, informative coverage of the news that really matters that we could possible need! Take the corporate money out of the news, take out the stupid government, and put it what really matters - upvotes! Upvotes and reddit gold!

On an unrelated note, of the top 10 links on the front page of r/worldnews right now, 8 of them are about events that took place in the US. Apparently the mods gave up, the horde has won, and the US is now the entire world. Also, remember Breaking Bad? BREAKING BAD? HEY GUYS, RICIN WAS USED IN AN EPISODE OF BREAKING BAD!

My first sighting of Redditor oppression this morning. 

&gt;Teenagers; teenagers everywhere!

Yes, I am sure quite a few, but I notice that Reddit likes to pretend that all things wrong with this site are because of teenagers. They don't want to image that they are associating with grown adults who think that the word faggot is funny. The only picture I have ever seen of a redditor is a 50 year old from Texas. It is the same way with the white rights stuff. They think that they are communicating with a 21 year old STEM major, when in reality, they re agreeing with the writings of an unemployed neo-nazi with a criminal record. 

&gt;Who gives a shit about twitter. Twitter is just a promotional tool for your popularity and narcissism

Why don't people like what I like.

&gt;using the word faggot != Homophobia

Reddit loves literal meanings that do not reflect societal usage--see African-American. Yes, you could argue that it is not homophobic in a literal sense of fear of homosexuality, but homophobia has a much broader cultural definition. In addition, this falls under the ""it's not this, so it is ok jerk""--see piracy and stealing.

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/user/KickAssMallCop) is his youtube channel.

Reddit has been pretty much vicariously living out their violent fantasies through him, to the extent that they [Raised 20 grand so he could buy equiptment.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/darien-long-mall-cop-reddit-video_n_2601615.html) In a recent video here he seems to provoke a group of men into a confrontation, who are seem threatening but never actually attack him. He [tases one of them ](http://www.youtube.com/user/KickAssMallCop) and then starts brandishing a real gun in a crowded mall. He was recently arrested for battery  for allegedly [tackling a man](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=IYSIQ67_oS8) who was apparently trespassing. And reddit loves him.

This is the same reddit which is constantly up in arms about police brutality, this guy is not even a cop and he is extremely violent! but its all ok because the mall is full  of bad guy drug dealers (Did I mention reddit is suddenly anti-drug?) 

Anyway, in my opinion this is prety thinly-veiled racism and vicarous ""justice porn"" fetishizing of vigilante violence. Can you imagine a similar situation, where the people being tased where white? Getting tased for selling drugs at a mall? The while thing is really hypocritical- drugs? ok. Police brutality? cops are pigs. Unless we are in atlanta where everyone who populates this mall is trash, and deserves to be shot. Would love to hear what other people think.

You are surrounded by like-minded individuals. You've had similar arguments with similar people and you've all come to the same exact conclusion.

Most people entering specific subreddits that cater to political ideologies will come in having made up their minds, believing firmly that logic and reason are on their side.

So when you're confronted with the opposition, surrounded by a plethora of people who agree with you, what do you say? How do you behave?

The Anarcho-Capitalist subreddit finds itself in just such a conundrum. Much like the /r/politics questions asking people ""How do conservatives possibly accept the things they accept?"" this community asks itself a question:

***Why is there so much resent towards objectivism?***

Now, immediately you can see a problem. The submitter is asking like-minded people why others disagree with them.

There is no one, forcibly present within the thread, to represent the opposition.

First, I want to say that the top comment does an excellent job advocating for the other side...for the [first paragraph.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/16vuh3/why_is_there_so_much_resent_towards_objectivism/c7zuhgy)

&gt;First off, many in this subreddit dislike ayn rand. There is an excellent article by murray rothbard on how she was the worst human being ever, and the ayn rand faq on the group headed by yaron brook has a section on how much libertarians hate her. I am not an objectivist, and am sick and tired of people bringing up ayn rand.

Alright...alright...you're prefacing it with why people that are of the same ideology as you disagree with objectivism...not exactly the question, but at least it represents some level of juxtaposition.

&gt;To answer the actual question, it is because people only look at the intentions of your actions, rather than your actions. A politician says that he wants to help poor people, and people believe him.

Suddenly the oversimplifications and strawmen arguments emerge. 

Is it not possible that there is a lot of information to dig through? Could it be that certain studies suggest some things and other studies suggest opposing things and that we are faced with a pretty daunting task when trying to decipher truth from fiction?

Is it possible that people are skeptical of politician promises but that they believe that it's the best option?

&gt;Also, they see people getting rich by helping people, and assume that the intention was to make money, not helping people. Then they judge these rich people based off of their supposed intentions, not the fact that they invented many things you cant live without, and could have invented everything the government invented.

Now, I'm an anarcho-capitalist, but you're just being ridiculous. Sure, there are people who do good for others out of the goodness of their hearts but we wouldn't balk at defending the profit motive. We posit that even purely selfish gains can only survive in the free market if they benefit others.

The rest of this person's comment is devoted to saying that people are faced with propaganda from a young age and that that is why they believe the things they believe.

But I want to get to the *really* meaty circlejerk.

And it comes to us in the [second highest rated comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/16vuh3/why_is_there_so_much_resent_towards_objectivism/c7zu9bt)

&gt;I think the kneejerk reaction of complete hatred for libertarians comes from the fact that we can usually win debates fairly easily, both with logic and empirical evidence.

Really now? You can speak for all libertarians?

Surely there are libertarians that frequently get demolished in arguments.

Surely there are libertarians that can't remember all of the empirical evidence.

Surely there are libertarians that aren't of that predisposition purely for logical reasons.

Everyone hate's us because we out-logic them.

Seriously though, if this type of reasoning was in /r/atheism we'd post it to the Halls of Sagan.

&gt;Every hardcore statist has, at one point or another, been publicly defeated in debate with a libertarian.

You heard it here first folks!

It wasn't just that all of you liberals lost an argument to a single libertarian and felt ashamed. It was that you were *publicly* humiliated by your betters!

&gt;So just like in nature, when you see a snake/wasp that's black &amp; yellow, and you jump back in fear... that's what statists do when they see a libertarian.

Your fear of us is purely biological. We are your predator, you are our prey.

Fear us.

&gt;It's a gut reaction of hatred. We signal real danger to their ideology. Not just a minor disagreement about interpretation of law, but a complete refutation of the basis for that law.

Do you hear that sound? It's the sound of every opposing viewpoint in the world crumbling before our mighty logic!

*Thankfully* some reason comes in and the next reply puts him in his place:

&gt;You can't be serious. Please tell me won't be this circlejerky?

Good...surely people will suddenly recognize just how pathetic they're being.

&gt;Why would you be a libertarian if you didn't think it has superior reasoning?

&gt;Libertarians pose the biggest intellectual threat to liberals; this should hardly be a surprise.

Hell nah, mother f***er!

&gt;Libertarians defeat liberals within their own liberal paradigm, which as throwahoymatie pointed out signals a real danger to their ideology.

It has been stated twice folks! It has to be true!

&gt;Why else would you avoid argument and resort to emotional hogwash if you didn't get ""logic bombed"" in the past?

Oh...could it be that people have legitimate reasons to believe what they believe?

Could it be that anarcho-capitalism can sound utopian and crazy?

Nope, logic bombs.

There are many fantastic insights into why the rest of the world hates us because of our superior brains but I want to leave you with [this conversation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/16vuh3/why_is_there_so_much_resent_towards_objectivism/c7zw0ph)

The [fourth highest rated post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/16vuh3/why_is_there_so_much_resent_towards_objectivism/c7zvi86) informs everyone that

&gt;If we win, they have a lot to lose.

&gt;Their friends with government jobs will be ruined. They'll feel intense guilt for supporting a failed system. Their friends with jobs in state-regulated industries will likely be ruined. Their assets may become devalued. They'll be poorly-adapted to the new culture.

The poor, helpless, hapless, foolish liberals.

Desperately clinging to their ideology because otherwise their lives will have been wasted.

&gt;This is why they're hostile. I don't blame them. They have so much to lose. I don't find it mysterious at all. The struggle for public opinion has the highest stakes. They know that if we win, the consequences for their system are apocalyptic.

I, um, don't know what to say other than I guess ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS REDDIT?

First off, I don't intend to marginalize male rape. I'm sure it happens, and I'm sure it's traumatic, and I hope that those affected have gotten help and live normal lives. As such, this would be a fine post in a vacuum. But this isn't a vacuum.

This is Reddit. This is a site that not only marginalizes rape, but excuses it.  Story about how you cleverly convinced chick into having sex with you? So alpha, brah. Story about how you had sex with a chick who was too drunk and you felt bad about it? Don't worry dude, it was her fault. 

Did I mention marginalizing rape? Here, let me mention it again. Reddit marginalizes rape. All the time. [See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/13pi0d/men_too_can_be_raped_a_reminder_that_us_men_also/c76791n) Yeah, he did just say that women are to blame for marginalizing rape.

I'd continue, but I'm getting too fucking angry. Does Reddit not see the fucking hypocrisy? The number of examples of rape apologist comments and posts on here is astounding.  Almost everyday, you here people claiming things like ""She wanted it because she was dressed like a whore"" or ""She wanted it but then changed her mind because she was ashamed, and now she's ruining this guys life. Bitches"" or ""It's not rape if she enjoys it lul lul lul"" etc. But, when it comes to men, everybody has a persecution complex. Male rape is an issue worth discussing, but not in a sensationalistic way on a website known for rape apologists. Fucking hypocrites.

I don't know the circumstances, but this seems like a shitty thing to do. Certainly threatening lethal violence doesn't calm a high-tension situation. Let's say what Gretna did is at best a necessary evil.

This is followed by some classic reddit [post-racial society](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/yxu0v/til_that_in_the_aftermath_of_katrina_the/c5zvkx6) and the universal truth that ""sometimes a niggers just a nigger."" (This section is currently being SRS'd.)

Well, other than the fact that this accounts for a bump of about 30 homocides. And that no other cities, [including San Antonio](http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Study-Katrina-crime-wave-nonexistent-in-Houston-1715592.php), had this kind of crime bump.

But according to many of the regular posters on /r/Libertarian, I'm probably statist scum because I believe that a (small) government does indeed have a legitimate purpose in society. Over the past 6 months or so I've watched as the quality of /r/Libertarian deteriorated after every big national story led to more nutjobs and conspiracy theorists flooding the sub with insane posts. It started with the ""Dorner good, LAPD bad!"" posts, and got worse with the ""lockdown"" after the Boston Bombings (DAE police state??). After the 537th post on the NSA I decided to stop going to /r/Libertarian because there's very little of value being posted in that sub anymore. Today, however, I decided to see what was going on in there and was met with this beauty of post sitting right on the front page:

[Why do we as a people regard police in such high esteem. When in fact they are agents of the opressive govrernment and enemies of liberty.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1k9qkq/why_do_we_as_a_people_regard_police_in_such_high/)

Oh boy. Let's get started.

Sitting right at the top at 41|8 this post:

&gt;Indoctrination. We are told from our earliest years that police are the good guys that we should trust them and they protect us from all manner of horrible things. Unfortunately, most people never get past that delusion

Because the police are *definitely* the bad guys. In every situation. Anyone who believes that police can do good things is delusional. The good guys are really the murderers, rapists, robbers, drug dealers, extortionists, kidnappers. You know, all those people who take advantage and violate the rights of others.

Here's the top reply to this:

&gt;My dad told me that when he was a boy he wanted to be a policeman when he was older, then he wanted to be a firefighter, then he wanted to be in the air force.

&gt;That's some mighty fine indoctrination by the state...

Because nobody ever wants to actually serve. It's all just a ploy by the state to increase their ranks of jack-booted thugs. That comment tree then goes into a conversation on why firefighters are evil agents of the state as well. Firefighters.

Further down we see a pseudo-intellectual take on the police which I will break down the the important points:

&gt;I spoke to my friends at a cabin this past week and the conversation started with me saying police are useless (outside taking notes).

&gt;I said ""no, if your house is robbed, an officer will come, file a report, and tell you nothing will most likely be done."" They just couldn't fathom this idea that the cop, effectively, still did nothing. They couldn't fathom the idea that, at this point, I need a court system, not so much a police officer.

&gt;They couldn't fathom this idea that if they were actively raped, no officer in the world would help and would often even by pass the very idea a criminal isn't going to sit around letting you make a phone call to report him.

&gt;It ended with one person saying that if I thought cops were useless, then I HAVE to think firefighters are useless because if they came to my house while it was on fire, I wouldn't have them put it out.

&gt;I guess that analogy was in regards to them thinking a burglar actively in my house wouldn't be stopped by an officer if I called them (again, see police response times for reason as to why this isn't a legit scenario but my house, actively on fire, would be as fire tend to respond fast and not hurt citizens).

Police officers *never* figure out who robs houses, they *never* bother to respond when some calls in a rape, and they sure as fuck *never* get to the scene of the crime while the perpetrator is still there. And if they do get to the scene of the crime, the first thing they do is hurt everyone in the general area. Right...

Someone attempts to talk some sense in response to this post and is downvoted. 8|15:

&gt;So you, being the titan of industry that you are, are going to personally track down this hypothetical thief, collect the necessary evidence, and bring them to the court by yourself? Very bold. 

To which the response is:

&gt;Private detective. Private courts.

lol

As we get towards the bottom things are getting braver.

&gt;Same thing with the military. They're just mercenaries.

Hired guns meant to oppress you! 

Let's jump to the posts that attempt to go against the hivemind.

&gt;Because police are necessary to maintain law and order. Yes, you occasionally hear awful stories about power-abusing police officers, but just think of our current society (not some idealistic utopian one that is millenia away) with no police force, and the levels of crime that would result.

Level headed thoughts on why the police are necessary in a functioning society? 14|14. 

&gt;Are you guys serious? Police are the puppets of the elite? You guys need to stop this right now. Yes, some police behavior has gotten out of hand I.e. warrantless searches. But do you guys really think they are ""warriors""? Please people. You're almost as bad as r/politics. This is disgusting

11|9. 

&gt;Yes it does! People throw out the entire country police force just because of the actions of a few. I have gotten speeding tickets before and interacted with cops on numerous occasions and I have never been beaten or yelled at or anything unethical. Some were actually nice. For example, I got caught speeding 85 on a 55 but the cop was nice enough to see that I didn't have a long record and only fined me for the lowest amount possible. People need to be real. I'm a Republican, but love to see the Libertarian mindset and accept it. But stuff like this makes it more difficult to do so.

2|5.

&gt;I'm shocked that this kind of ignorance is being spouted in a Libertarian forum as well. There are bad cops who don't know how to do their jobs, but the great majority of cops respond to calls about abuse/rape/murder/threats/robberies. If they're not responding to calls, they're patrolling to make sure those crimes and other crimes (like drunk driving) are stopped or don't occur. They will also pull up behind you at night when your car breaks down so no one accidentally hits you, they will give you directions, they will help you file missing person's reports, and they'll swing by your house to check for intruders if crimes have happened in your neighborhood. They protect the peace. All of this police-bashing needs to stop.

5|7. And here's part of the brilliant response with one important point highlighted:

&gt;

    There are bad cops who don't know how to do their jobs,

&gt;There are criminal cops, that actually break the law and violate peoples rights, then there are cops that cover for criminal cops, there is no 3rd type...

    (like drunk driving)

&gt;**Drunk Driving should not be a crime**

    They will also pull up behind you at night when your car breaks down so no one accidentally hits you,

&gt;today most cops will NOT stop for motorist in distress, I see them drive by every day, unless they are CALLED they are not stopping

I'm going to skip over the part where he says that there are *le*terally zero moral upstanding police officers and jump right to this point: **Drunk driving should not be a crime.** Seriously? An incredibly selfish decision that directly puts the lives of others at risk should *not* be illegal? Look, I'm all for doing away with punishments for victimless crimes like prostitution or motorcycle helmet laws, but doing away with DUI laws is asinine. This is why people look at Libertarians as fringe wackos. Because of assholes like this guy.

This last post I will include has everything. Cop hatred, Sweden inclusion, and 2edgy4me opinions:

&gt;What we? I despise police officers, they are the lowest of the low. I had a discussion at work today where I had to explain why I hold this seemingly ""radical"" opinion. It might be something they expected from some obnoxious left-wing teen or aspiring rapper but I'm none of that.

&gt;I've never been mistreated by police officers here in Sweden - they are always polite and friendly to me but I despise them anyway for what they are

&gt;...

&gt;I just want to clairfy that I do mean all police officers. They are evil people worthy of contempt. It doesn't matter that police offficers provide a necessary service when that service is bundled with horrific crimes against humanity. It doesn't matter that the service is currently not bundled where you live, what matters is that at least 99% of all police officers would stay on the job if repression was introduced as one of their tasks. They are amoral people - to them might makes right and therefore to be right they need the might.

Stay classy /r/Libertarian. The vast, vast majority of the people in this country understand the need for a police force. Shit like this is part of the reason why we will never have a viable national platform.

[Here is the link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/15wp80/a_patent_application_filed_by_sony_uses_small/)

Anyone who has ever been on Reddit can predict what the comments will be like. But these are really bad.

For one thing, filing a patent does *not* mean the company intends to actually implement the technology. Companies like Sony and Apple file thousands of patents just to have them around, as back-ups, and to keep the competition from having the technology. So the first thing to do is NOT assume that this patent means Sony will use the technology. Assuming anything would make an ass out of you and me, and neither of us want that. 

So what does Reddit do? Assume Sony will use the technology, and do so in the most archaic, draconian way possible. Let's get right into the comments, where the true anti-Sony circlejerk shines.

&gt;So if my Sony console breaks I have to buy all the games again because the disk is married to the console. This sound like a poor idea.

Top comment. I consider this to be a truly insultingly stupid thing to say, given that, as the article even suggests, tying the games to the hardware is unlikely; they'll be tied to a user-ID, or account, or something like that. The article literally says, ""As described in the patent, this ""unique information"" could be a system identifier or some sort of unique user ID that is somewhat portable between systems."" As ambiguous as that is, what is *doesn't* say is ""the disk is married to the console.""

But yeah, let's assume that it does, because that's so much more intuitive and reasonable. How can we hate Sony if they aren't doing literally everything wrong, all the time, in every way possible?

But what is REALLY funny is the first, and top, reply to that comment:

&gt;It sounds like Sony just wants us all to get on steam and stop wasting our money. That seems to be their goal.

Wow. So a patent for a hypothetical technology whose only purpose is to disallow reselling of games is SO FUCKING AWFUL that it'll force all of us hardcore gamers to STEAM! Because if there's one thing Steam doesn't allow, it's reselling of games. Wait - what? That doesn't make sense. If I'm mad at Sony for taking away my god-given right to sell my used games, but I'm in love with a service that takes away my god-given right to sell my used games - wait, no, that makes sense. Yeah, that makes sense. Steam rocks! Gaben is so fat! HL3?

The good news is, that comment gets called out for being hypocritical. And how do hypocritical Redditors defend themselves? By appealing to... something. Piracy, usually. 

&gt;As bad as it sounds, I'm not overly concerned about the ability to re-sell my game when it only costs $7. I don't think any game is worth more than about $45, and very very few are worth more than $15 to me. To me, re-sell value is a way to make an $50-$65 game cheaper (and you don't even get to keep the game after ""making it cheaper"") because lets be honest, you're not gonna be getting much for the games you find in the bargain bins. Quick Edit: If I couldn't get games at super low prices, I'd still be pirating. Or doing something productive.

1. ""No video game is worth more than one week's allowance. Duh. Who do these people think they are, charging $60 for a game that took millions and millions to produce? Don't they know I don't spend more than $15 on a game?""

2. ""But fuck bargain bin games. I deserve only the best. So if I can't get the best games possible at the lowest conceivable price, you better believe I'm going to pirate it.""

Okay, okay, I'm putting (a few) words in his (and we all know it's a boy) mouth. I'll move on.

One person mentions that the games aren't going to be tied to a console, but probably an account or something. Which meets the following retort:

&gt;So my gf can't play my game on her profile. Still a poor idea.

First, how do they know that? They don't. They're just making it up. Secondly, and more importantly, there's simply no pleasing these people. If you were to invent physical distribution of video games on discs today, these guys would be like ""Wait, so I have to literally drive my car to a store, and pay full price, plus tax, and they don't even reimburse me for gas? And if I scratch the disc, they won't replace it for free? And if I want to play on more than one console at the same time, I have to buy a second disc? FUCK THE CORPORATIONS! DAE AMERIKKKANT?""

&gt;I bought Warhammer Space Marine and it was so awesome but I couldn't let my friends play because it was on hard and they would die every 5 seconds. Make a new game on normal for them? Nope. Fucking 1 save bulllshit.

Totally irrelevant comment that has nothing to do whatsoever with Sony's new patent technology. 

&gt;This. Why can't it be tied to an account at least.
Fuck you, Sony.

""Why can't it be tied to an account at least."" Why can't you read the article at least? Or do you just look for the most popular, easily-consumable opinion, and then react angrily to it?

&gt;Not only if the console breaks but think about the future! I still play games from the ps1 and dreamcast. What if lets say in the future Sony creates the ps5 and there are no new copies for the games I want to play on the ps4. Then I'm forever fucked and can't play all the games that I missed on the ps4!

More hypothetical complaining, the sort that accompanies every single new generation of consoles.

Once you get away from the uppermost comment threads, it doesn't get much better. Fortunately, one amongst us is wise enough to know what the CORE issue is. Here's the CORE issue.

&gt;No one is addressing the core issue here. When you buy something, it's yours. You can give something you have bought to someone else if you want, whether it's land, a car, a coat or cash. Digital oligarchs like Sony want to turn the world back to where they own everything and you own nothing. It's the economic model for feudalism or pure slavery. The only solution is to stop buying their products if you can have an alternative. Stop. Do not support their business.

Okay, so, again, this is frankly not true. At least not the first few lines. Intellectual content has never been a product that you purchased and ""owned."" People think that stuff like books and N64 games are purchased, ownable products, just because they're physical objects, but they are merely licenses to consume the content they contain. Yes, even a book is just a license. The fact that this content is housed in a physical object is accidental to the content, a byproduct of the limited distribution methods of the 20th century, not fundamental to the nature of the content. 

""Digital oligarchs want to turn the world back to... feudalism or pure slavery."" Really? *Really?* Sony patenting a technology that cuts out middlemen is LITERALLY the same thing as making you, the consumer, a slave? How can people make claims like that? Do they realize how insulting it is to, I don't know, REAL ""pure"" slavery?

&gt;This. It disgusts me that certain companies (in this case sony) want to tell me what I can and can't do with something I paid for in full. They no longer own my copy of the game, so they shouldn't be able to say ""you can't sell that to a friend, it makes us lose money."" For the record, I get they don't want me to rip the game and sell a million copies for $5 each, and it makes sense. But when the only competition they have for any given game series is used games, and they want to shut it down... It's just despicable.

There's nothing really to say to this stuff. It's so entitled, misinformed, and righteous, I can only assume its written by someone with zero experience in the real world. 

&gt;I remember back then the argument used for software was that you did not actually bought it, you bought the license to use the software.

Yes, that *was* the argument. It still is. Actually, its not really an argument, more of a fact of life. That people choose to disregard it says nothing about that fact, but speaks volumes about the people disregarding it.

Some more random comments...

&gt;Sony.Never.Learns.

So.Brave.

&gt;I'm glad they are going out of business. Credit rating - Junk like their overpriced DRM bullshit.

""I'm glad!"" Why? How will your life be improved by Sony disappearing? Are your emotions that tied up in this bullshit?

&gt;Really? Are the execs seriously THAT out of touch with reality?
I mean it's like the opposite day. It seems like they're brainstorming on how to completely destroy their business instead of coming up with ways to make money.
Or are they sick of the whole PlayStation thing and just want to bury it? I don't get it...I don't get it at all.

Blah blah, fucking suits, go to hell bankers, #Occupy, I'm-smarter-than-paid-professionals...

&gt;The more drm I see, the more I am encouraged to start pirating games.

HEEYOOOO!

&gt;And why is anyone still giving their money to Sony - they have consistently proved they don't deserve it.

&gt;Looks like I'll never have a reason to ever buy a Sony console ever again.

&gt;This is why people pirate. Now they will have even a greater incentive to hack their new console.

&gt;One more reason to hate Sony. Way to go.

As if you needed a ""reason.""

-

Some of you may think I'm being totally unfair about all this. I'm not saying I love the idea of companies making it impossible to resell my old games, nor denying that we are inevitably moving towards that day. But making up new definitions of what it means to own a product, and demanding that the world conform to your particular business practices (ie, pirate or die), is just stupid. 

I'll say it again: I don't love this new technology, whether or not it is every truly implemented (I don't think it will be, it sounds unwieldy, but I'm totally speculating here). I just can't stand watching these guys jerk themselves silly over this situation, relying on mostly false or badly misinformed premises to do so. 

Comments are supposed to, at least in theory, contribute to the discussion. This is a case where not a single comment said anything of value that was not available in the original article. In fact, this is a case where the comments actually took AWAY from the article, operating on assumptions that the article itself would have helped dispel. This is pitchfork-rally mode, facts be damned. Gut reactions are all that matter here in r/technology!

But really, the funniest part of all of it, is that even while Redditors rally against the licensing of content by Sony, they wholeheartedly endorse the licensing of content by Steam. I just can't get over that.

""It sounds like Sony just wants us all to get on steam and stop wasting our money. That seems to be their goal.""

I mean... What was this person thinking? And what were the 127 net upvoters thinking? Are THESE the gatekeepers of modern technology? Honestly, I'm glad they don't think Sony is listening to them. Sony shouldn't listen to them. They don't have a fucking clue what they are talking about, nor have any inkling of a desire to *get* a clue.

1344834583.0,157,self.circlebroke,y4owb,Adopted Nationalism makes Racism A-Ok! Reddit's racial clusterfuck regarding utopia of Japan. (Long vent),cookedmonster,186,29,164,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/y4owb/adopted_nationalism_makes_racism_aok_reddits/,"Reddits intense anti-American bias and perma hard-on for those Norswedenmarksland is frequently brought up on r/circlebroke.  [A few times](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/t44mc/why_exactly_does_it_have_to_be_europe_worship/), we've discussed the [weeaboo fantasy of Japan](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/xl830/step_aside_sweden_japan_may_be_a_contender_for/) in some depth.  So I'd like to elaborate on a bizarre and persistent feature of the circlejerk regarding Japan - specifically in r/Japan.  And I really need to vent so sorry if this gets LONG. 

Some quick background: I've been lurking in r/Japan for about 654654984151 years or so under various user names.  It is now a shockingly large subreddit of over 20,000 subscribers but most posts (when filtering out the tourism/visa/study abroad questions) are pretty placid and get maybe a dozen comments.  Almost everyone on the subreddit is non-Japanese - after all, Japan has their own anonymous internet discussion site - and judging from the types of posts we get, most are people who are English teachers or are studying abroad for a short period. I have spent an hour doing this because these are such consistent, mind boggling circle-jerks that I've seen over a bazillion whole years on that subreddit.  They are variants of reddit's own complexes, especially regarding American-hate.
 
But there is a twist.  It is the weird racism wherein presumably white Western redditors adopt the racism of the most extreme Japanese people. This involves self-hate (America fucking sucks amirite!) and also intense dislike of Koreans and Chinese for **NO FUCKING REASON** and I just snapped tonight.

**1. Only Americans can be racist**
 It isn't the same anti-American jerk, although that comes up almost daily, for no reason.  Just as a quick example, there was a [fabulously specific post on educational systems between Japan and Singapore](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/xtbvl/would_you_choose_to_raise_your_children_in_japan/) a few days ago but people still managed to squeeze in how [shitty](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/xtbvl/would_you_choose_to_raise_your_children_in_japan/c5pg3nt) and [dangerous] (http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/xtbvl/would_you_choose_to_raise_your_children_in_japan/c5ph3rn) American elementary schools are. 

Rather, take this recent example instead.  A [recent article about bat-shit crazy Tokyo mayor Ishihara, who publicly called Western judo athletes ""beasts"" and shit on the Olympic spirit](http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/xprgn/ishihara_western_judo_animals_fighting/) gets nary a peep, except that the [linked site is unreliable](http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/xprgn/ishihara_western_judo_animals_fighting/c5ojnqp) even though it links to a real newspaper. [One guy even AGREES with Ishihara] (http://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/xprgn/ishihara_western_judo_animals_fighting/c5oif21) because Westerners are fat amirite?! 

Compared to this banal story of Japanese racism at a [4], 1 week later a rare 200ish voted story emerges regarding [stupid 'Mericans ruining the Olympic spirit with their racism against Japan](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/xz3z5/you_stay_classy_merica_racist_tweets_after_us/).  Of course, racist tweets about bombs and tsunamis are really horrible but, why is racism any less acceptable when coming from Americans?  Some in the thread are annoyed that all of America is reduced to a couple of idiots on twitter, so OP explains:

&gt;[18] [I'm American too, I know that not all of us are as ignorant as these people. Thats why I put 'Merica ...](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/xz3z5/you_stay_classy_merica_racist_tweets_after_us/c5qwaa2)

I...I don't understand. Maybe it is a unique consequence of being an embattled white guy locked under the eternal ""outsider"" status in infamously closed Japan but, what? That's his explanation and it is seemingly accepted by the posters.

**2. If you've been discriminated against in Japan, you are wrong.  You probably did not keep the *wa*.**
I think this must be a self-preservation psychological trip but many, many expat consistently argue that there is no racism in Japan.  This is just so false that I can't believe it is regularly peddled on the subreddit. In [every](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/s9meq/travelling_to_japan_any_racism_against_darker/) [casual](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/r0u0u/korean_americans_in_japan/) [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/gfdl7/chineseamericans_in_japan/) by a non-white redditor worried about racism, the posts grudgingly say ""yeah there might be some racism but it is generally fine. All my Indian/Philipino/Korean/Chinese friends say they never had real problems."" When it comes to White foreigners though, good luck getting any sympathy at all.  The greatest villain to all Westerners intersted in Japan is [Debito](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/hydru/to_people_in_rjapanespecially_the_gaijins_what_do/), a former American expat who became a vocal activist for anti-racist change in Japan. Well, stupid white guy - if you don't like it, then just leave! When Japanese people discriminate against you, [they are just so polite](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/hydru/to_people_in_rjapanespecially_the_gaijins_what_do/c1zek8h) [and worried about their poor English](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/hydru/to_people_in_rjapanespecially_the_gaijins_what_do/c1zehzv)! While Debito is alienating, the absolute anger towards him triggered some [repetitive](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/t13oz/yes_i_can_use_chopsticks_the_everyday/) [posting](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/uli1j/more_on_microaggression_guestists_haters_the/) about how really, as a white person, you [should really just take it](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/iexx3/wtf_just_happened_rjapan_has_anyone_else_ever/) [because that's just how Japanese people communicate](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/fry2l/racism_in_japan/c1ia19x) [etc etc etc] (http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/fry2l/racism_in_japan/).  The weird thing is, most expats are self-aware enough to realize the bizarre tension [between] (http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/wh2u5/why_do_gaijin_seem_to_hate_each_other_so_much/) [expats themselves](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/ow850/what_is_the_deal_with_foreigners_hating_other/) but it doesn't translate in anything deeper when talking about the day to day bullshit. 

**3. Koreans suck**
I still remember a [rather sweet post by a Korean-Japanese redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/u611n/please_rjapan/) who kindly asked r/Japan to stop with the thinly veiled anti-Korean racism.   It is at a 0 now. There are links to questionable statements in that thread but in any case, the top comment is simply 
&gt;[Ive not seen anything overly anti korean here]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/u611n/please_rjapan/c4slyqa)

This is straight up wrong. Every post regarding Korea is inevitably controversial.  Every single one, whether it is about [Kpop groups](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/pags7/japanese_2ch_users_claims_that_the_kpop_group/), [comfort women](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/vluas/tokyo_district_court_orders_nikon_to_proceed_with/)[photo exhibits] (http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/o4ra1/koreans_plaster_tokyo_with_comfort_women_posters/), or the stupid Dokdo/Takeshima [island](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/y2rz3/s_korean_olympic_soccer_player_barred_from_medal/) [controversy] (http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/j9etl/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_takeshimadokdo/), all wrapped up by the [Olympic rivalry] (http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/xuelo/south_korea_and_japan_will_compete_for_olympics/). 
Also, 
&gt;[Koreans are worse winners than they are losers. And they are the worst losers and biggest cheaters in sports and academia in the world.]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/y2rz3/s_korean_olympic_soccer_player_barred_from_medal/c5saqhn)

I complained about how weird it was that random expat Westerners identify with Japan to the point where they end up taking on the mantle of [anti-Korean rhetoric](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/y3ixf/this_dokdotakeshima_hate_needs_to_stop/c5s54h8).  Bringing up irrelevant [other controversies] (http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/y3ixf/this_dokdotakeshima_hate_needs_to_stop/c5s17wi) in order to state, without any historical contextualization, that [Koreans will forever be Haters](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/y3ixf/this_dokdotakeshima_hate_needs_to_stop/c5s8abe)? What is the point of that? Oh wait, by the way, [the Chinese suck too](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/y3ixf/this_dokdotakeshima_hate_needs_to_stop/c5s7vxz)? And one extra jab at the [Jpop Kpop rivalry too](http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/y3ixf/this_dokdotakeshima_hate_needs_to_stop/c5s8abe) for good measure.
 
I just don't understand how a random expat is educated and invested enough in Korea's postcolonial bitterness and Japan's post-imperialist snobbery to end up spouting off anti-Korean remarks in his own right.  

Anyway, all this cutting and pasting is hurting my wrist.  Thank you for letting me vent about the racial hangups of the neckbeards of reddit.

**Edit1**
I've been on Reddit roughly since my 2nd year in grad school, which is 2006.  I joined r/Japan at its inception so I estimated at 6 years.  This is incorrect because subreddits only developed like in 2008.  So 4 years.  I am literally worse than Hitler. I guess this error invalidates my entire post.  I hope I didn't make a spelling error. 

**Edit 2**
Look at the nice message I just got!
&gt;[No. Shut up idiot.

**Edit 3**
See, it is so bad that I can update this post for-eva.  My favorite new discovery is from a consistent troll poster - a ""proud Canadian"" who immigrated to Japan (he claims) 19 years ago.  His posting history is full of Japanese far right rhetoric, racial slurs everyone else, and a huge chip on his shoulder that leads to frantic bragging about his Japanese proficiency.  But a lot of his comments are actually upvoted! Ah, r/Japan you sure do attract the crazies.

[The post in question](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ixk6o/religion_to_disappear_by_2041_claims_new_study/).

First off, I must say I find it very ironic that a sub full of people claiming to be oppressed for their beliefs from a 'Christian nation' would upvote a study that claims that religion will *dissappear* in developed countries in **less than 40 years**.  I mean, come on.

Top Comment:

&gt;[Sadly, this is wishful thinking.
](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ixk6o/religion_to_disappear_by_2041_claims_new_study/cb90my9)

Well, yeah.  It's beyond wishful thinking; it's obscene.  In 2041 just about all of us will (hopefully) be alive.  Do you think all of those religious people are all of a sudden going to completely 180 by then?  And that not only **a single** religion will disappear in under 40 years, but *all of them??*

A response to the top comment:

&gt;[I think it will be later, and there will always be SOMEONE that is religious out there but as long as information/education is free and the access to it is there, there will be a good fight](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ixk6o/religion_to_disappear_by_2041_claims_new_study/cb94628)

Because only the smart understand Atheism is the one true way and all those dumb idiots who believe in their Magic Sky Fairy are just uneducated.  

Props to this guy:

&gt;[It's amazing how much this isn't going to happen. So many religions have fundamental components that have been proven objectively false--the eschatological predications of Seventh Day Adventism and the anthropological/archeological claims of Mormonism come to mind--that still have thriving communities of believers. Religion is too much of a natural fit for the human mind to disappear anytime soon, certainly not within the lifetime of anyone in this forum.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ixk6o/religion_to_disappear_by_2041_claims_new_study/)


But back to the jerk!

&gt;[Disappear is an exaggeration, but I have no doubt that we will see it marginalized to obscurity within the next few decades - large parts of Europe are already there.

Ah, yes, fitting in the good ol' Europe-jerk.  Not only does this guy think Religion will fall into obscurity within just a few decades, but it already has in Europe!  You hear that, guys?  In an entire continent the Churches are *literally* ghost towns.

Now an American jerk:

&gt;[I think this claim is overly optimistic and that it will take much longer for religion to fall by the wayside, but I sure hope I'm just being a negative-nancy and proved wrong.
In America, I notice fundamentalist Christianity seems to feed off of an imaginary victim complex. I'm very afraid that as the fundies become fewer in numbers their dwindling influence on mainstream society will fuel a very passionate desire to fight against the ""oppression"" of their faith, and the few that remain will basically turn into something akin to a western-christian equivalent of the Taliban. Very extreme and violent....technically illegal and operating in opposition to the authorities, yet still finding ways to thrive and have way too much influence on people and politics through either intimidation or connections to people in positions of power who secretly still share their faith....something along those lines.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ixk6o/religion_to_disappear_by_2041_claims_new_study/cb910ko)

Did this guy just potentially compare religious Christians in America to the Taliban?  Yes.  Yes, he did.  He even uses the word 'fundie'!!

Oh, and a nice blow to their egos:

In all, I honestly do not understand why /r/atheism is so bothered that other people believe in different things than them.  Do they not understand that the furious and stubborn-certainty they display and shout at people about is the same thing they consistently blame on religion?  That they can be just as bad, if not worse, than their supposed enemy?

[But Reddit's most recent reaction to him is pretty ridiculous.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/18zk4z/til_that_the_smartest_man_in_america_with_an_iq/) He's stupid, an idiot, and, oh yeah, a freak with a gimmick.

&gt;If I recall correctly, he is also pretty psycho on how he feels we should weed out idiots.

This is the top comment. I absolutely despise Reddit's predisposition towards eugenics, so I guess I should find this comment refreshing. It spawns a few more comments ripping on the guy for this, and I find this kind of funny, given the prevalence of the pro-eugenics elsewhere on the site, but I guess that isn't really fair of me. This comment is one of the better ones in the whole post, and I'll let it go.

&gt;He is also devising proof of God using math.

I find the idea of a modern mathematical proof interesting, and *maybe* the commenter does too, but something tells me s/he's using the comment disparagingly. 

&gt;I mean, all a high IQ like this means is he is GOOD AT IQ TESTS, not a you know... an intellectual

That was the direct response to the bit about proving God, which re-inforces the idea that trying to prove God is, in their eyes, the antithesis to being smart. ""So he can take a stupid test? Doesn't mean he's smart, like *me.* *I* know there is no such thing as stupid God. He's not, you know, an *intellectual.*""

Someone takes a crack at understanding his abstract for his ""mathematical proof for God,"" and it sounds really fascinating to me. It reminds me of something like Spinoza's concept of God, which is a sort of (for lack of a more nuanced term) pantheism. 

Someone else, however, quickly rejects it. 

&gt;His logic seems to be a complicated form of circular reasoning that describes the means for describing the universe within his description of the universe.

How much do you want to bet that this commenter spent less than 20 seconds analyzing the argument (secondhand of course from another comment, not from the source itself) and then spit out this accusation? Anyway, on a big enough scale, *every* system is ""circular,"" as in, self-contained and ultimately self-referential. But that's a philosophical position that isn't worth getting into here...

""How does that prove God's existence,"" someone asks.

&gt;It doesn't. I think this is an example of what happens when a highly intelligent person isn't properly educated and left to his own devices to come up with a theory of everything and too egotistical to admit when he's wrong.

Lol, talk about the pot calling the kettle black.

&gt;Oh my god, he believes in randomness and that the universe behaves in a way that creates an information processor? What a fucking retard.

Literally a retard. This is where the comments go from mildly-jerkish to outright rude, and where the circlejerk really picks up steam.

&gt;That doesn't add up.

Says the Redditor who read another Redditor's brief summary and then formed a gut reaction to it.

&gt;The guy who started Paypal is smart. This is just a freak with a gimmick.

DAE ~~ELON MUSK~~ IRON MAN!?

Seriously, the *gall* of this random Redditor to call Langan a, and I quote, ""*freak with a gimmick...""*

Okay, now onto the next parent comment.

&gt;I'd say there's a huge difference between doing well on a test and being an actual genius.
He could very well lack the natural intuition that many geniuses throughout history have had.
So no I wouldn't call him the smartest man in America simply because he has a high IQ.

What can I say to that that it doesn't say of itself?

&gt;He did an Iama and I imagined him to be a friendly guy now that I read this he seems like he's kind of a dick.

""I had an opinion based on what the guy actually said, but now that I'm hearing some random second-hand stuff I have a brand new opinion, and tha'ts that this guy is obviously kind of a dick.""

&gt;Did you also learn that the I.Q. test is horrendously outdated?

There is a strong case to be made about the merits of the IQ test, sure. But using the potential ""datedness"" of the IQ test to completely dismiss someone's alleged intelligence is a pretty, ahem, *unintelligent* thing to do. Whether the IQ test is good or not, it's the easiest, most quantifiable standard we have, so it's what we use. 

The fourth or fifth comment is, ""He chose his own path. Can't blame him for that."" Which is completely fair and true. Right?

&gt;He didn't ""choose his own path."" I've read a bit about this guy and he was too egotistical to make it through college successfully. He didn't get any kind of structured education, so he's never any academic work of value. That's why he works as a bouncer. He doesn't have any other options.

Smugsmugsmugsmugsmugsmugsmug

&gt;Sorry. IQ over 200 according to who?
And why the fuck should I be impressed with his non-existent academic accomplishments if he's never bothered to get an advanced education..
That's like waving a flag about how patriotic you are, without ever learning the history of your country.. Ok, so crap analogy.. But still.

You don't have to be impressed, no one said you had to be impressed... God... And 200 IQ according to who? According to an IQ test, I'd imagine. Christ.

&gt;This guy is a fraud, he hides behind complex words to confuse the everyday person rather than the substance of his claims. Probably the reason he is a bouncer: http://anamericanatheist.org/2011/04/07/my-criticism-of-chris-langans-ctmu-theory/

Come on, really? A *fraud*? Fraud of what? Having TIL posts made about him? 

&gt;If I remember right, the guy is a fucking liar too. I watched that series of videos on youtube, and I seem to remember that he claimed he wasn't allowed to graduate because his head was too big for the cap.

Now the vitriol comes out. He's a fucking *liar,* TOO. 

&gt;If you ever see a video on this guy, he just seems like an arrogant prick.

""I saw fifteen seconds of a video once, I hate this guy.""

&gt;All round pretty stupid actually

Yeah, all around stupid. Literally *stupid.*

&gt;They say Iq isn't as accurate as they thought it was

&gt;If he was really smart his gobbeldy-gook theory would be understandable to morons like me.
""We can talk about lesser regions of the real universe in such a light, but not about the real universe as a whole.""
The whole universe smells like tacos. I wish I had a taco. See, that wasn't so hard.

&gt;this kid isn't the smartest anything anywhere.

Look at this stuff!

The third top comment does a good job summing up what this thread is all about.

&gt;ITT we all try to sound smarter than this guy.

It's totally okay to find Langan's personal theories strange, and it is also okay to find faults with the whole idea of an ""intelligence quotient."" But all this TIL is about is that the highest IQ in America is a bouncer. No one is asking Reddit to love him, Langan himself isn't forcing his ideas on anyone, or anything personal. But Reddit gets so fucking defensive over it, that they have to hate him, knock him down, and call him an idiot, *just because* he has a high IQ and isn't Einstein or something. 

One impression I got about Langan is that he doesn't believe in the modern education system - it is too bureaucratic or something. Although I don't mind the modern educational system, I feel like Reddit's anti-reaction to Langan is probably the same sort of shit he's dealt with his whole life, and just enforces his life decisions to remove himself entirely form that system. By virtue of having a high IQ alone, he's opened himself up to the judges, juries, and (if they had their way) executioners of Reddit to disparage him as a ""freak with a gimmick.""

Anyway, good thing we have Redditors here to put Langan in his place, otherwise I might have actually *not hated* the guy for a second or two!

(Before I go further, the reason the poll is ridiculous: PPP's question about preferred fillers of the seat asked about eight conservative candidates and Colbert. That means that conservatives split their votes among nine candidates, liberals didn't split their vote. Additionally, there are multiple candidates that had equal or higher approval ratings than Colbert [making the actual headline of the article wrong] and most of the other choices had terrible name recognition).

Most upvoted comment
&gt;He's an incredibly smart man who really understands the system. This country could do much worse. In fact, with many sitting senators, this country is doing much worse.

DAE think people who have dedicated their lives to public service are don't understand the system and are terrible?

The response?

&gt;And that's exactly why he'll never get picked.

Not because he's a comedian, not because he doesn't live in the state, not because he's said on multiple occasions that he doesn't actually want to hold office, it's because he's **too smart.**

Further down the rabbit hole (same thread). 

&gt;Meh, Arnold Schwarzenegger became the governor of California. I'm betting that Stephen Colbert could take the senate seat if he both (1) tried and (2) wanted it.

Right, if he wanted it, an extremely conservative and GOP held state like South Carolina would embrace him with open arms!

Next guy does bring in some common sense!

&gt;But in order to serve that two-year term, he would have to be appointed by South Carolina's Republican Governor, which is 100% impossible.

Quickly to have this flame of logic be snuffed out by: 

&gt;Not just based on the fact that Colbert is (by all appearances) a moderate liberal (though he very strongly supports the military); but SC Gov'r Nikki Haley has this thing and it's fucking golden, and she's not just going to give it up for fucking nothing.
Seriously though, it's a valuable political chit she can use to either advance her own or to advance a compatriot's aspirations.

So if Governor Healy doesn't appoint someone who doesn't fit her or the majority of her state's political views, she's clearly corrupt.

&gt;If she uses it for her own personal gain there's a huge chance she will go to jail
source: happened to Rod Blagojevich

Logic again?!?

Nope.

&gt;But she's a Republican, which means that she's pretty much immune from having to face the consequences of her actions.

All of this stemming from [the first comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/14m52j/poll_stephen_colbert_the_most_popular_choice_to/c7ec5zr)

[Original poster returns for more:](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/14m52j/poll_stephen_colbert_the_most_popular_choice_to/c7ebo33)

I guess why this got me all riled up is because this is a perfect example of reddit just *not getting it at all*. This march was a slutwalk, which is basically a feminist rallying march. That means that the people in this march come from a lot of walks of life, many of whom are trying to do this as a way of getting over traumas or past hardships- often rape.

When some assclown comes up and ~~shits~~ pisses all over that, that will make people angry. It's not a ridiculous jump of reasoning. You're saying to the people of this march ""you don't matter. I'm here to show you you're an idiot""- because they don't... just shut up and accept sexism? What the fuck, reddit

Full disclosure:  I watch soccer.  And when someone looking for cheap karma posted a video of Luis Suárez, I knew that the circlejerk would be infuriating.

Luis Suárez is a Uruguayan player for Liverpool FC, who had recently gotten banned for ten matches for biting someone.   Ten matches is one of the longest bans ever given in the Premier League.
  On /r/soccer, most people (even Liverpool fans) agreed that Suárez was talented, but clearly a very difficult individual (since this is the second time he's bitten someone during gameplay).  Last year, Suárez was also in trouble for allegedly racially abusing Patrice Evra, a black player, so by now, most people knew that it was kind of futile to defend his behavior.

I will say that I'm not a huge fan of his and that his behavior in the video is very difficult to defend, so I won't.

Many of the comments on the video are exactly what I expected, which made it no less frustrating to wade through, looking for informed comments.

The most upvoted comment was
&gt;As a hockey fan: Why doesn't someone just punch him in the face?

There were a lot of comments comparing the weak sport of soccer to the manly sport of hockey, where apparently, you can just punch people and intend to injure other players with no repercussions.

&gt;If players didn't dive so much, this kind of shit would be noticed a lot more. In the end, the players have done this to themselves. ACT LIKE A MAN AND STOP DIVING.

There were a lot of jerks about diving, even the video doesn't really depict diving.  In the video, Suárez gets away with some cheap fouls, with some of them appearing to be malicious and others appearing to be typical  mistimed tackles.

&gt;I've never sat through an entire soccer match. My disinterest is more likely due to the rules and officiating than the players. I can respect playing within the rules to your advantage. But in this case it's detrimental to the overall product to me. If Steve Stamkos, one of the stars of the NHL, can take a frozen rubber puck to the middle of the face, get stitched up, and stay in the game.. Then these fuckers should be ashamed of themselves to screaming in agony and getting carted off on a stretcher because someone kicked them in the shin. But the rules dictate that this behavior will give them an advantage. The overall attitude towards that behavior in the sport just kills it for me.

A beautiful post about how weak soccer players are in comparison to hockey players, how diving is unsportsmanlike, how ""cheating"" will get you an advantage, and that the poster has never actually sat through an entire match, rendering his entire point void.  I've never watched an entire basketball game or a hockey match, so I don't feel as though I am well-informed enough to discuss the way those sports operate, but this genius seems to believe that he understands the most popular sport in the world by watching parts of matches.

He also fails to realize that getting kicked in the shin by a professional soccer player, while running, is very painful.  Typically, if a player is kicked, they will stay down for a little bit and eventually, will stand up again.  He might be drawing a free kick for advantage, but typically, players aren't looking to get others carded, since the refs generally do not reward cards for challenges like that.  Many players do end up playing through injuries because there are limited substitutes per match, making their presence on the pitch very important.

Relatively recently, Cristiano Ronaldo got elbowed in the face and had to get his eyebrow stapled.  He played until the half was over, but stayed in even though he went blind at one point during the first half.

&gt;I honestly think that's a good part of why Americans don't like soccer. As a people, we take sports—and sportsmanship—seriously. You don't fake injuries, you don't try to injure people, and even in hockey, you fight as a result of the game, not part of it.

Ah, America jerk.  This was another major component of this mess of a circlejerk.  Apparently, most of the World doesn't care about sportsmanship.  Luis Suárez is one of the most hated men in England because everyone just loved the fact that he bit another person.

&gt;Im not a big soccer guy in fact ive never even heard of this guy. But after seeing this video I now instantly hate him.

A three minute video is clearly enough time to have an informed opinion on one of the best players in his league.

However, this is certainly worthy of an effort post as I feel that their arguments need some dissection.

Let's set the stage: [this article](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/01/21/engineers_cold_and_dead_inside/) is posted to r/science. It's a mess of reporting that is somehow actually trying to be serious (or is it, I honestly can't tell). Hardly scientific journal material, but reddit loves bite-sized content so they don't have to read too much so this one is going to fly. Also of note, I had to look up ""trick cyclist,"" because apparently it's slang for psychiatrist. What?

Anyway, the article uses lots of inflammatory and provocative phrases so it's a sure recipe for fun. With sentences like:

&gt;The results were clear-cut, apparently: engineering students cared nothing for other human beings' feelings and had few of their own.

and

&gt;They were cold-hearted and uncaring, remorseless human machines. By contrast the medical students were warm and bursting with empathy and love.

The article reads straight out of The Onion. However, it's somehow still okay to post in r/science.

[On to the reactions](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/16zmls/new_study_engineers_exhibit_less_emotion_and/). Currently, the top post mentions a good point about comparing STEMs to Medicals, but that's not where the meat lies. One post down, currently at +200.

&gt;We don't need engineers to be caring, we need them to be competent.

also I'd like to highlight a response
&gt;That's why we put all the incompetent people in sales.

Now full disclosure, I'm a second year computer engineering student, so take that as you will. However, this whole notion that ""it's okay to not care about people because I'm an engineer"" is complete and utter bullshit. Now, I understand that there are lots of asocial and antisocial disorders that contribute to certain people's lack of empathy. That is not the problem here, the problem is otherwise normal people perpetuating the idea that it is a-okay to be cold in this profession.

More comments:

Someone tries to fight the jerk:
&gt;Building a slick thing is great, but if you're not solving a problem people actually have or communicating to people in a way they understand, you've just wasted everyone's time.

He gets contempt and snark back at him:
&gt;That is why we have management, they decide when something is needed/useful; i just make it.

Huge ego alert:
&gt;I (and most engineers I know) simply have a low tolerance for morons. It's a feature, not a bug :)

""I understand you, I just don't give a shit"":
&gt;They're using the definition of empathy as submissive, dishonest, and good at reading people. The important part of empathy is understanding how people feel, not necessarily caring about it.

Edit: People have rightfully pointed out that the above poster has a valid point. I do still disagree with the first sentence of their statement, but indeed, I now see that the second is correct.

And something that really struck me:
&gt;I mean I flocked to engineering because it meant less social interaction. I wanted a job where my lack of social aptitude wouldn't hamstring me.

Honestly, do people actually think that engineers have no on the job social interaction? No matter what you do you'll most likely have a supervisor, general coworkers, team members, subordinates, and inter-department contacts. You'll have to be able to present your ideas/progress/products to higher-ups in an efficient way. You'll have to interact with all these people, and doing so with empathy allows you to have the best workplace experience possible because you attempt to understand your peers and care about them. Would these engineers who advocate this anti-empathy sentiment want their peers not to care about them? I wonder.

In closing:

&gt;Engineers aren't dead inside, they're alive, with strong purpose and intention. They aren't affected by most people's emotions because most people's emotions are silly and baseless. How is it a virtue to abandon useful efforts to hold the hands of fools?

Children are never of value and never become intellgent productive members of society of course. But I've always wondered if they ever considered that they were once children too, and if so, wish that themselves were aborted. Then I found out that atheists, childfreers, and vegetarians are all gloriously brave individuals with PHDs in logic and reason, and thus are worthy of being raised to become brave, free thinking atheist adults. 

&gt;I think there's definitely a connection between being childfree and having above average critical thinking skills. There seems to be a lot of people on this thread that are childfree, atheists/agnostics, and vegetarians/vegans. All require using rational thought rather than just following social norms.

&gt;Alright, I'll just list everything:
I am a mentally ill, childfree, queer atheist. I don't mean to sound like a douche, but I'm also a genius, for lack of a better term. 

...I have yet to see a braver pair of comments.

&gt;I am a childfree atheist. There are many of us edit, I noticed everyone gave reasons. My life is amazing right now, I've worked my ass off for this, I love going out, coming home whenever. I am an atheist because of numerous reasons mainly concerning the illogical nature of that in a natural world. I've always been a curious individual that uses only scientific fact to base a decision on. Anecdotes and experience with everyones kids and married couples has let me see how theyre really, really unhappy compared to what I have.
I can see why you ponder a correlation. For me, the connection is this. I make the rules in my life, I dont live by convention. I integrate facts and reason into the debate and leave little room for society's influence on me. I dont need to procreate, altho I am aware it is my biological purpose. However, being aware that it is my purpose gives me the distinct advantage of rebelling against those very same innate needs.

It's a movie trailer for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut *Don Jon*. From what we can gather, it's a comedy about a guy who is addicted to porn and a girl who loves chick flicks and how those two things bring unrealistic expectations into a romantic relationship.

Today, I'd like to counter that movement with a trip down the dark alley that is /r/libertarian.  While I personally disagree with libertarians on many issues, that is not why I'm writing this.  I'm writing this due to a thread about an Obama speech, in which they proclaim that a few words about trusting government is the ushering in of tyranny.  That thread can be found [Here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1dt1dw/and_that_folks_is_what_a_dictator_sounds_like/)  

Let's start.  First off the bat, we have this comment:
&gt;Obama telling people what to think. How subtle, what a cunt.﻿

This guy eloquently takes issue with a politician telling an audience how to think, because it's not like every politician in every speech ever has laid out his ideals for how people should think about issues.  This is currently sitting at (89|33)

&gt;Ooooo...... ""This country cannot accomplish great things if we pursue nothing greater than our own individual ambition.""
Right at the Libertarians there....
I literally can't believe what I'm hearing. I mean I know what an idiot he's always been.....but this is just ridiculous. I can't......

Again, a very well put argument: because Obama disagrees with me, he is an idiot. (63|19)

What's even more startling is the reply to this comment, which states: 
&gt;He's not an idiot though. He's incredibly intelligent, and that's precisely why he is so dangerous.

Yes, because Obama isn't an idiot and doesn't agree with you, he is a danger to the American people. (40|8)

&gt;The head Statist telling young kids that slavery to the State is how you have a happy life and not to fear the State.

Yep, trying to inspire confidence in the government in a liberal democracy = Stalin. (54|10)

&gt;someone should edit in the clip from Star Wars where natalie portman says ""so this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause""

Obama's commencement speech at Ohio State will forever be remembered as the moment in which America fell on the slippery slope to tyranny.  Trust me. (65|19)

&gt;This speech was the equivalent of a mother telling her infant child to never get off her teet and to always continue to be breastfed.

There are no degrees to help from the government.  Asking for people to have a little more trust in the government and get involved with it more is the same as being completely dependent on it.  Ask me about my critical thinking skills.

In conclusion, we can see that the circlejerk on Reddit does not entirely lie at one end of the political spectrum.  It in fact encompasses all types of political ideologies on this site.  For every legalize weed thread in /r/politics, there's an ""Obama is Stalin"" thread in /r/libertarian.  Too often, both sides come to conclusions way too fast without stepping back for a second and truly considering the implications of what they state.  Because of this, an innocuous speech by Obama clearly aimed at wanting a more functional government was construed as the downfall of liberty.  Just like in other larger subreddits, the prevailing conclusions in /r/libertarian only serve to confirm their pre-existing opinions.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_1dw42u,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1dw42u/rlibertarian_uncovers_proof_of_obamas_tyranny/,

You'd be wrong, eugenics won again. Presumably because of the inference in the title that they both have kids, although I don't see any proof that it's even true.

&gt;You should have to apply for a license and pass a test to be able to have children.

Some select others:

&gt;No he's right. Stupid people breeding and smart people not breeding are going to kill us soon.

&gt;I agree that smart people are not going to be bred out of existence, but irresponsible poor people should not be allowed to have kids. Those kids end up costing everyone else a lot of money.

DAE Idiocracy?

He has an exchange with this new fella, and both are celebrated, by random users.

Look. I'm sure these guys are nice people. Perhaps in their spare time (hurr hurr what spaare time you're on reddit all day apostolate, that's an observation nobody's ever made) they rescue orphans and kittens from fires, or build homes in Africa. Maybe they dress up as badgers in their spare time and fight crime on the streets of wherever the fuck they come from with special badger-related powers (hey look Matthew Inman, I can be random and wacky too! Hi*lar*ious!) Maybe they're just nice, friendly people. I don't know. I don't know them. I have nothing against them as human beings. I sometimes go far too far and say some fairly nasty things about them, which is my own hyperbolic problem and should not be encouraged. 

But why the *fuck* does Reddit celebrate them? They are the opposite of what Reddit should be. They post specifically to get the most karma possible. They post safe, obvious comments, leaving opinions they know Reddit will agree with, all over every rising thread, responding to every rising comment, to net the most upvotes possible. They stoke their popularity by making constant self-deprecating reference to it, and other Reddit celebrities. Their fame is reliant on the fact that they are famous (BUT THE KARDASHIANS SUCK AMIRITE???!?!?!/). The only thing they contribute to this site is *the fact that they contribute*. We already went through this with Trapped_in_Reddit, but this website has such a short fucking memory that despite such a furious backlash, they immediately and slavishly buy into every person who comes along and does the exact same thing.

And on the note of short fucking memories, why do people continue to post 'HURR HURR YOU COMMENT A LOT, APOSTOLATE' and 'HURR HURR YOU'RE ALL THE SAME ACCOUNT, APSOTOLATE'? You know how they know who Apostolate is? From other Apostolate circlejerks. You know what those circlejerks consist of? Those two comments.

1376324323.0,155,self.circlebroke,1k7pt4,/r/drugs discovers that CNN's Sanjay Gupta is just a mass media kingpin designed to manipulate society into... making weed legal. Really.,fingerflip,206,51,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1k7pt4/rdrugs_discovers_that_cnns_sanjay_gupta_is_just_a/,"So I post in /r/drugs a lot. It's been a decent community of harm reduction enthusiasts that's been quite well moderated. However, as any community grows (and as any Redditor observing gets more cynical and jaded), the quality of comments just deteriorates. Here's just one example of how /drugs can make any topic and any position into a giant circlejerk about how the media and government control everything and manipulate the blind masses of sheeple, while they themselves rise above this propaganda and know the real truth.

Something to keep in mind for context - drugs are illegal. Really illegal. Which means the type of people who discuss, use, and talk about drugs tend to be a bit anti-government at least. Or, at worst, outright conspiracy theorists and general nutjobs. So sadly, it's not uncommon to see incredibly obnoxious lines of thought such as ""weed is impossible to be addicted to"", ""the government keeps psychedelics illegal to prevent the masses from free thinking"", and ""DAE pharmaceutical industry = literally Hitler"". However, this post will demonstrate that even when mass media / ""the guhhmint"" / ""like, society... man"" goes their way, Druggit users will trip over themselves to circlejerk about how enlightened and out of the SYSTEM they are and how the masses are easily misled sheeple.

Now, the posts that inspire this particular jerk are based on some stuff that's been happening on CNN, the bastion of quality news and hard-hitting journalism in the 21st century. CNN's resident doctor expert dude, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, has notably reversed his professional opinion on the medical applications of marjiuana. He / CNN released a 44 minute TV special about how the conventional wisdom of marijuana is incorrect and, while not risk free, it can be of great help to many. It's actually a pretty balanced documentary that doesn't overly steer itself into the ""pro-weed"" camp like so many others.

So here's the Reddit thread linking to the actual documentary after it came out: http://np.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1k6pok/weed_a_dr_sanjay_gupta_special_for_anybody_that/

The first few comments are notably positive and pretty good:
&gt;Call me crazy but I think this video may play a key role in reforming marijuana laws here in the states. It depicts actual facts based on scientific research and not just judgemental biased opinions, and government propaganda.

**[\(+49/-2\)](http://np.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1k6pok/weed_a_dr_sanjay_gupta_special_for_anybody_that/cblyvq2)**, pretty good. Despite the ""government propaganda"" cringe line at the end, I'll give this a Pass. 

Not two comments down, as someone remarks on how great it is that a wide audience like CNN viewers (lol) saw this video, some witty le scholar chimes in: 
&gt;Shows you how the mainstream media controls society.

**[(+16/-5)](http://np.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1k6pok/weed_a_dr_sanjay_gupta_special_for_anybody_that/cbm2bl6)**. What follows in this comment thread is some random stoner philosophy about self-rule and how any control or authority at all is the worst thing ever.

Also in that comment thread, here's a twist revealing what should be unequivocally good news to any cannabis advocate is actually part of an evil government conspiracy to shut people up... all because, and get this... the Attorney General is talking to the media the day after it aired about something relating to drugs!
&gt;Call me crazy but Gupta reverses his stance and this special comes out right as Eric Holder is set to announce crumbs to the peasants.

**[(+6/-0)](http://np.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1k6pok/weed_a_dr_sanjay_gupta_special_for_anybody_that/cbm2npi)**. The hilarious implication here is that Sanjay Gupta is, to this Redditor, a rock star in the medical world who has such influence that the government would reach out and get him to do something in order to better orchestrate a public movement that they don't support. No, he's just a doctor on TV who isn't an idiot. That's all.

Skipping down a few, there's a pair of comments that are just the highlight of bravery here. These inspired this thread. While not the most heavily upvoted, they do jerk so hard I just couldn't help but cringe and then later whine about them in here.
&gt;How come it takes a doctor this long to realize, when goddamn teenagers with C averages are making sloppy presentations about this same stuff to their high school classes?

**[(+9/-4)](http://np.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1k6pok/weed_a_dr_sanjay_gupta_special_for_anybody_that/cbm1rz4)**. Okay, this comment alone kinda makes me want to hit my head on my desk. Someone whose career rests on them giving scientifically accurate and relevant medical advice to people has a lot more at stake than some random stoner who isn't creative enough to think of a better persuasive topic for a high school assignment. Forgive me for thinking doctors should be cautious about jumping to conclusions on substances that people legally aren't allowed to research in the US.

But this reply... this fucking reply.
&gt;I'm sure he ""realized"" it when the corporatocracy told his bosses he was allowed to ""realize"" it.

**[(+12/-5)](http://np.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1k6pok/weed_a_dr_sanjay_gupta_special_for_anybody_that/cbm395n)**. This is some next-level /r/conspiracy bullshit right here. Not a hint of proof, not a hint of precedent to back this up. Just wild, baseless, thoughtless speculation that a corporate conspiracy prevents doctors from holding opinions publicly. Everywhere, oppressed doctors are all in agreement about this grand substance that non-survey based double-blind research can't exist for, but the evil corporations are holding them back. You'd think this documentary would disprove that hypothesis, but alas, the corporatocracy (THATS NOT EVEN A REAL FUCKING WORD) has allowed Dr. Gupta to think it. There's literally no outcome where the Redditor would be wrong here.

There are a few more budding circlejerk comments but at the time of this writing most of them aren't popular enough to write home about and thus are mostly harmless. There's a more nuanced circlejerk in there about ""physical vs psychological addiction"" that I could go into, but it requires a bit more understanding of the topic at hand for us to truly complain about together. The short version is that drug communities take a tiny component of addiction theory to split addiction into two distinct and clear categories where they can put all of the evil drugs they don't like in one category associated with involuntary human response while the drugs they do like are in another category that makes it seem like you can just think addiction away. 

This is my first post in eons here, so I apologize if I've broken some convention. I just really, really wanted to write about how /r/drugs can even take FAVORABLE news, topics, and positions and turn them into evidence that the mega corporate government hivemind controls everyone except them.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,1376324678.0,,,True,t3_1k7pt4,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1k7pt4/rdrugs_discovers_that_cnns_sanjay_gupta_is_just_a/,

Anyway, this is not much an observation of a jerk, as it is pointing out a very hilarious counter-jerk and ""truth telling"" session which has been going on over in /r/AskReddit for a few hours.

Here is the whole thread:
http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hn7mj/whats_a_hard_truth_reddit_needs_to_face/

Now, you should actually go in and read this thread by yourselves, because it's a gold mine of counter jerking, jerks defending the jerk, gross generalizations, pun thread, etc. It's just a glorious mess of everything that makes up the *perfect* default sub submission.

So I'd just like to highlight some of the more humorous ""truths"" that have been pointed out (and voted up highly) because they play very well into our scope here at CB:

Top comment right now (and it will probably stay that way) is this, which is of course a borderline joke, but still:

&gt; Just because you are atheist doesn't mean you are clever or good at science.

Now I admit, that is not much of a counter jerk, because I'd say, outside /r/atheism and /r/atheismrebooted, this is the prevailing opinion of just about everyone... But I still wanted to mention it.

---
The third highest top comment, I really like, because it strikes deeper to the heart of Reddit, and I imagine many people are in denial of this:

&gt; Reddit hero worships harder than everyone they make fun of for hero worshipping.

---
The next one is especially directed as us at /r/circlebroke I think:

&gt; You guys are entitled pricks.

---
Moving down a bit, we have this one, which also is pretty straight to the point:

&gt; Activism means nothing if you aren't active.

---
This one is clearly directed at the /r/funny community:

&gt; Saying the most preposterous thing is not necessarily funny.

---
DAE still think Arrested Develpoment is the pinnacle of intelligent humor?

&gt; Quoting Arrested Development is not a substitute for wit.

Ah, here's a favorite of mine - this one spans quite a lot of different topic, trying to become a Reddit Catch-All if you wish:

&gt; Teenagers are here. They are always here. 90% of them you don't even realize are here because they don't act like it.
No, not all cops are out to kill you, corrupt, and teaming up with hitler and skeletor to destroy the universe.
You aren't entitled to have sex with a woman just because you're nice to her, by that logic every man you're nice to should have sex with you too.
You're not special.

---
I'm going to round it off with this one, which for many reasons is my favorite. Now, it's already been linked to from SRD, due to the fact that it garnered the most rage from upset Redditors protesting that those are *not* ""truths"" at all!

&gt; Atheists aren't really oppressed.

&gt; * The NSA isn't spying on you 24/7.

**WARNING: THIS IS A *LONG* POST!**

Before I get into the meat of this discussion, let me first give some background. As far as I know, /r/darknetplan was borne in the wake of SOPA/PIPA. Networking is a hobby of mine so I decided to subscribe to it. Anyhow what I thought might be an interesting place for discussions on hypothetical alternatives to the Internet, sadly disintegrated into a horrible rabble of baseless claims, paranoia, conspiracy theories, etc.

This Ars Technica post was recently linked, http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/would-you-give-the-government-remote-control-over-your-router/, and of course a flurry of idiocy followed in the comments. To be fair, a lot of the top comments concern why it is bad idea to rely on things like consumer-grade wireless routers for some sort of public safety network. however there is no short supply of delusional speculation and chatter lower down:

http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/yrxn3/no_fing_way_this_is_exactly_what_we_dont_want/c5yb2el

&gt;Well of course they are thinking about it. Do you really think they aren't paying attention to all of this DarkNet and MeshNet ""chatter""? This is just the sort of thing they fund the NSA for.

Oh give me a bloody break! Do these people really think the NSA doesn't have anything better to do?

Apparently the answer is yes:

&gt;Dear NSA.
&gt;I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid... you're afraid of us. You're afraid of change

&gt;Oh the ending (in the US) is easy to predict.
&gt;
&gt;IF (and it's a big if) people ever get their shit together and build a large decentralized network that ""they"" (the govt.) have no control over ""they"" won't stand for it.
&gt;
&gt;It will be labeled a ""threat to national security"" and those that provide it and use it will essentially be labeled ""criminals"". (They will use the usual arguments; terrorism, child porn, piracy, and probably the militia and anarchist etc. movements as the reason. The first time they can link a violent act to the DarkNet (even if it's not true, it won't matter) the shit will really hit the fan.
&gt;The Dept. of Homeland security will get a bunch more funding and will begin triangulating wireless access points (possibly using drones, but also land based (think of vans with big antennas driving around) and maybe even using existing cell towers and such.
&gt;
&gt;After which will will start seeing raids, arrests and confiscation of equipment. (Should be fun with the NDAA and indefinite detention and all that.) I'd also expect them to start trying to jam wireless signals and infiltrate the network by any means they can dream up.
&gt;
&gt;[Invariably someone is going to ask me ""why are you in this subreddit"" with that attitude? Because I find the concept interesting, I just think (because of the above) it will never work on any sort of large scale.]

&gt;How about we cut back on this war on drugs bullshit and funnel a little bit of that money over to upgrading police and fire/ems communications services? This seems all too much like a Patriot Act backdoor scheme; a data-mining stunt with a glossy shell if you ask me.

A juicy specimen if I ever saw one! This person has managed to incorporate the anti-war on drugs circlejerk into the Internet freedom warrior circlejerk.

In another thread, user jercos goes full on conspiratard:

&gt;The internet is already severely compromised and falling apart at the seams. Single organizations have shown the ability to block domains, to blackhole IP blocks, and to execute denial of service attacks on the scale of entire countries. That being said, I don't see the cattle being affected for the next decade or so. There's no profit in provoking an uprising, but if we don't have an alternative up, running, and ready in that timespan, we'll slide down a gradual slope away from privacy, and away from the people owning any part of our infrastructure.

And here's the only comment calling out the other idiots: http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/y27lv/serious_discussion_how_do_you_stop_the_darknet/c5shv2i

I have always loved this Encyclopedia Dramatica article, it sums these types up to a tee: https://encyclopediadramatica.se/Unwarranted_Self-Importance

In their psychotic fantasies, these people actually believe they are fighting some sort of monolithic instrument of oppression by posting cat pictures on the Internet. Most people there appear to only be interested in things which pander to their moronic world view, rather than engage discussion, as evinced by the downvoting of anyone who hints at self-awareness.

Now, I had intended on doing a writeup on this sub for awhile. However, time got away and I forgot about. I was doing some reading on networking and came back across it. Anyhow I wrote this fairly lengthy post that I am fairly certain was filtered. It never showed up in the new section. In any case, since the original post already describes a lot of the problems with the circlejerk in /r/darknetplan, I figure I'd just reuse it here. 

  
&gt;  It seems to me that lately, this sub has been taken over by a combination of sensationalists, conspiracy theorists, and some sort of bizarre cyberpunk-wannabe breed of neckbeard. I know these are inflammatory words, but I am not trolling (the idea that ""trolling"" is expressing contrary opinions has become prevalent, it's not. trolling is engaging in antisocial behaviour for the purpose of instigating conflict and derailing discussions.) and I intend on qualifying these statements.
&gt;
&gt;    Let me say that first, as I am subscribed to this sub, I obviously have some interest vested in the idea. There are plenty of legitimate reasons to at least theorize about implementing a sort of alternative internet, if not at the very least just for fun! I myself have several major complaints with the internet as it stands:
&gt;
&gt;* ICANN's stranglehold on the DNS. If .xxx wasn't already enough, gTLDs are basically outright admission that ICANN is a racketeering group. Seriously, read their .xxx ""Trademark Protection"" bit, it almost literally reads like, ""Nice trademark you got there, it'd be a shame if not registering it under a TLD you will literally never use to pre-empt domain squatters would be used as evidence of abandonment...""
&gt;
&gt;* The intrinsic insecurity of the internet, and the mess of band-aids that form the horribly byzantine set of protocols which it relies on. In particular the vulneraibility to things like DDoS'ing.
&gt;
&gt;* Outrageous abuses of local monopolies by ISPs. Filtering traffic, throttling, not even providing the bandwidth you pay for, port blocking, instead of, you know, investing money back into the network.
&gt;
&gt;There are of course many more shortcomings I could list. However, instead of discussing how to remedy these and others, many if not most comments seem to be devolving into wild, baseless speculation. Specifically, it seems to be a common belief that the US government is explicitly preparing some sort of mechanism to censor the internet en masse. There is a quote I like by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, that I believe to be pertinent to this issue, ""Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer; nothing is more difficult than to understand him."" SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, CISPA, etc were/are all stupid, and harmful but people seem to misunderstand why they exist. It's exceedingly easy to relegate Congress, RIAA, MPAA, and others into some nebulous concept, of ""the Man,"" but doing so would be incredibly naive. Do I think groups like RIAA and MPAA are composed largely of greedy jerks? Yes. Nevertheless, just because people are greedy does not mean they try to blow up the proverbial dam, or whatver, just 'cus. That doesn't even make sense. I was against SOPA not because I think piracy is some sort of right or that the gub'ment had it in for me, but rather because it had far-reaching implications and imposed US law upon an international entity.
&gt;
&gt;    The thing is, people attach this odd messianic quality to the internet. At best it's misguided, but at worst is reminiscent of a creepy modern-sort of ""White Man's Burden."" Columnist Evgeny Morozov writes, ""When we get the remote Russian village online, what will get people to the Internet is not going to be reports from Human Rights Watch. It’s going to be pornography, ‘Sex and the City,’ or maybe funny videos of cats.” But the biggest problem is that this mythologized struggle against the internet, as some sort token of democracy, is fundamentally misguided if not delusional. For starters, the internet was conceived of by the epitome of ""the Man:"" the DARPA and the US Militarily People do not seem to understand how censorship in dictatorships work. As a dictator is ""the man"" and the internet is some sort of symbolic vigilante, people somehow think a dictator can't access it, or doesn't know about Facebook. The most publicized instances, for instance blacking out all communications in Egypt, have also been the least successful. Think about it, what is more suspicious? Blocking the internet, or a couple of sweat shop shills make fake blog posts? Perhaps the most egregious instance of this stupid saviour complex was the non-existent ""Twitter revolution"" in Iran. I won't bother explaining why it didn't actually exist, there are plenty of articles which can. What I will say is that using Twitter as a medium for activism is almost literally the stupidest way of doing so I can fathom. Twitter is almost a perfect example of of anti-privacy. Who needs spies when dissidents will state their location publicly.
&gt;
&gt;    Well, I apologize for these overly long post. Hopefully, we can put down the tin foil hats and try to discuss the pragmatics of the Darknet.

EDIT: One last thing that should be brought up is that most people on Reddit who invoke free speech or the first amendment don't know how it works. At least in the US, obscenity is not considered protected speech. Now, obscenity is of course tricky to define (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it). But, the point is, when redditors get in a huff over American shows being prudish and not showing breasts, or whatever, the government makes no claim of protecting such things.

The title is just terrible, both in the submission and in its heavily biased source (which embeds an idiotic clip from MSNBC).

Of course, let's throw some American politics in there, because we can, even though it makes no sense, and insult someone's ""journalism skills and basic vocabulary"". I'm not sure what ""journalism skills"" have to do with this, and ""basic vocabulary"" is somewhat ironic considering he's completely misusing martyrdom.

Redditors waste no time to [claim *everyone* who opposes gay marriage is a homosexual](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/yppdk/antigay_pastor_caught_masturbating_at_playground/c5xrmnk). At the time of this writing, this is the top post in the comments section. How does this make any sense?

&gt; #5. [Fixed approach] Thread to remove /u/jij and /u/tuber as mods

Look at this. Let it sink in. Take a step back and remember that the only thing jij and tuber did was to make memes go into a self-post. THAT WAS IT. The chosen one that they huddle around is a mod who admits to rarely being active which defeats the whole purpose of being a mod. Jij and tuber didn't just ""ban"" memes for shits and giggles - they banned them because they were flooding the front page with crap content. They were, as they say in French, DOING THEIR GODDAMN JOB.

&gt; #6. The Mod's [sic] need to give some sort of statement about the poll
&gt; #7. At the moment, 15 of the top 25 posts on r/atheism are against the changes, none of the remaining 10 are for it
&gt; #8. I'm 89 years old and have 8 PhD's, 2 nobel peace prizes, and 4 Super Bowl rings and I want the old subreddit back
&gt; #9. 65% of responding users now reject banning image posts, 23% approve

#8 is probably a troll, but the others... ""If you're not against us then you must be for us"". I want to call it an ad populum again but I think it's an ad everything. It just... I don't... even...
Screw it, let's use that Thomas Jefferson quote again. Hahaha. Ergo, I win.

&gt; #10. The largest free thought and Atheist forum in the world has been hijacked by religious ideals.
&gt; #11. This new mod policy has been shown to have no foundation in the community.
&gt; #12. I'm a 40 year old academic with a PhD and I ALSO want the old rules for /atheism back

I'm more educated then you, thus my opinion is more equal than yours. It's unpopular and therefore a bad thing. Apparantly, moderating content and preventing people from gaining imaginary internet points for a 10 second oh-so-funny rebuttal or attack on religion is a ""religious ideal"". I'm not even sure if these people are atheists, anti-theists are just contrarians anymore...

&gt; #13. How r/atheism lost the gay community
&gt; #14. r/atheism needs its memes and images back and here's why...
&gt; #15. I, for one, am eternally grateful that there is someone like jij out there to decide what I'm supposed to like
&gt; #16. Scumbag Moderator

Oh snap, they're learning the ways of sarcasm. Too bad it doesn't make their point valid. jij isn't deciding what you're supposed to like, all he did was place a restriction on how you express your views i.e. no more karma for low-effort content. Memes and images are still allowed, all you have to do is click ONE MORE TIME to see it. How can these people ""pwn fundies"" if they don't have the patience to click a whole extra time?

&gt; #17. Hate the new /r/atheism? Here's how to get it back.
&gt; #18. The Arguments in Favor of the New Moderation Policy Are Shit
&gt; #19. I want the old system back!
&gt; #20. Here's the problem
&gt; #21. THe new rules of r/atheism are stupid and need to go away

I've never heard so much whinge over such a minor deal. It's practically a non-issue. These people are reacting like jij came in and took all their toys away...

&gt; #22. Let us pray to God so that the new mods will listen to the wishes of the community &amp; take back their silly rules.
&gt; #23. Memes and images are not karma whoring. They condense complex ideas to a short, concise form essential to reaching a population with attention spans measured in seconds
&gt; #24. I like the 1-click memes...

""Memes and images are not karma whoring"". ""Attention spans measured in seconds"". And you wonder why nobody takes r/atheism seriously? Also, I like how after logic and reasoning fail to work, they turn their faith to a higher power asking for their memes back.

&gt; #25. Has it ever occured to you that what you think is ""silly"" or ""stupid"" might hold meaning for someone else?

In other words, the memes were never low-effort to begin with. Right. I'm done.

Reading the image macro i knew there would be some sort of jerk in place but little did i know what i was getting into while opening the comments. 

&gt;As an engineer myself I can say that this is mostly due to lack of personal identity. Engineering IS hard but some people need to constantly remind their surrounding of that since that's really all they got.

**BOOM!** Right off the bat we have this comment basically giving the notion that its ok for engineering majors to be assholes because they need to be.

The first child comment is kinda understandable if you remove the connotation that only engineering majors can get upset when people brag about their higher grades to you. 

&gt;And bitterness about others generally having more free time, putting in less effort and getting higher grades. When someone studying 'retail and marketing' comes to you and says ""I GOT 80% on my essay"" when they've done nothing but go out drinking for the last 3 weeks, while you've been locked away, working and getting 65% the whole time... you get frustrated.

During my brief time in college i've had friends brag about their 80% and 90% to me while i'm in the midst of venting about my terrible grades and it really is annoying, but definitely not an engineering or STEM exclusive complaint.

The next comment is just an irrelevant ""le relevant username amirite?"" comment (because the poster above has Civil Engineering in their name) but it proceeds to set off a chain reaction of ""DAE Civil Engineering is literally non-STEM?"" and a huge dick measuring contest of who has the harder engineering major/degree.

On to the next top level comment: 

&gt;At most places, like my engineering university, it sucks. Like a lot. Lots of alcoholism. Highest suicide rate in the state. Two deaths in the last two weeks. Like if you haven't experienced it its hard to describe. Sometimes we get exam questions that can't be answered.

&gt;1. It attracts people with generally low social skills. Everyone here has a mental problem, sometimes its obvious, but sometimes its not. but it pulls people who don't have the same mental filter as the normal population.
&gt;2. It sucks. Its not fun. Its really hard. Its worth it! Its so worth it!!! but it sucks for 4-5 years and its hard to see the communications majors slide through college and then walk across the stage and receive the same piece of paper as you. It takes a lot of convincing to remember that it is worth sticking it out in engineering. often that means putting down the degrees around you. Whether or not they deserve it.

&gt;tl;dr It doesn't excuse the behavior but these are poorly adjusted people under incredibly high stress, with no short term benefits.

Now this is a beast of a comment to tackle, because on one hand they're right but on the other they're wrong. I can't speak for the opening paragraph since there's no university listed other than ""my engineering university"" (and google can't read minds). but the first point is where i kinda nod my head but raise my finger for a counter point. 

A lot of STEM majors attract people with low social skills because they're painted as these secluded positions where you're only forced to interact with the unwashed masses a few times and are generally left to themselves to be smug and crunch numbers and do whatever it is they do when left alone (Which is highly untrue, at least in regards to most starting engineering positions). And as for attracting people with ""mental problems"", i've met enough seemingly well adjusted people with engineering degrees, and just as many who actually have some sort of mental problems (like depression). it could be anecdotal evidence speaking but i doubt there's some huge correlation of mental illness and engineering majors, and in fact i've seen way more people with mental health issues in the IT field because of how secluded and private a huge percentage of jobs can be.

And the second point is where it just becomes a huge ""no, just stop."" If you're unhappy with your major and you're getting to the point of experiencing depression of cynicism because of it, just stop. find something you want to do, change your major, take a semester off to find yourself, or just play the field and maybe even * gasp * take a non-STEM elective! you're not forced to stick to something you hate just to end up hating it even more and causing yourself problems down the line.

The rest of that comment thread turns into just stories of ""well this guy who knew this guy who knew this guy knew this guy that killed himself because he couldn't handle the stress of engineering"" which goes back to the point i just made. 

And finally the cherry on top of the entire thread, this ""le gem"" of a comment which pretty much solidifies everything in the thread

&gt;Well, if your major is *Liberal Studies*, you sort of deserve it.

The rest of the comments are just iterations of the top three, as well as a few ""aka: all of reddit"" comments and really no voice of reason otherwise. The thread was already close to 12 hours old when i stumbled upon it so i doubt much will change before it falls off the front page never to be seen from again, until someone reposts the image a week or two later and the whole cycle starts up again.

The old joke about Circlejerk just having to copy and paste comments from r/atheism, r/politics, and r/worldnews has never rung this true.

The top comment of the thread is so virulently anti-American that I had assumed it was satire. It wasn't until I started scrolling through the thread that I realized--with horror--that the top comment was *not* in fact satire, but was just as bitter and resentful as any rational onlooker would judge it.

Ladies and gentlemen, with a comment score of +645 to date:
&gt;Hooray for us Brits, fuck the Americans!!

This is the kind of belief that even the most jingoistic nationalist wouldn't vocalize for fear of losing credibility. And yet, there it sits at the top of the most upvoted thread in r/worldnews, with the majority of comments supporting that attitude:

&gt;I normally cringe at anti-americanism, but... they were being fucking douches..."" [+208]

And of course, it wouldn't be an anti-American tirade without Americans apologizing on behalf of America.

&gt;As an American, I wish more of our allies would tell us to go fuck ourselves when we act like asshats. [+33]

One of the (very) few mediators I was able to find, calling out the top comment for what it was, is what finally led me to believe that the sentiment was genuine:

&gt;I'm glad we got the circlejerk started so quickly. [-20]

This leads me to believe that its appearance at the top of r/worldnews is, as usual, a way to disparage the United States and nothing more. I began to probe into why this particular thread was so toxic. Maybe it's that there's considerable resentment towards the amount of attention payed to American politics during the election. Maybe it's something more specific, like anger at the backlash that the Nobel Committee is receiving for selecting the EU as the Nobel Peace Prize winner. Or maybe it's self-loathing Americans trying to make reparations. Even if I knew the reason, it would be totally unfathomable to me.

and

&gt; The troll fight scene has to be done correctly...ideally with R levels of blood and gore...but clearly that won't be happening.

Hah. Okay dudes. Good luck with getting a movie based on a kids/young adult book to be made for adults. 

The whole top comment thread is basically that. Clamoring for a book that is for young adults be geared to adults, because they're adults now (or, at least, close to it) and that's how it must be made.  There's no consideration for the fact that, you know, they may want to market the movie to the demographic that the books were (and are) written for and marketed to, or really any consideration for the fact that all movies aren't always made with the 18-24 ""critical thinking"" white male demographic in mind. 

The next two top comments are legitimate excitement, which is nice, but after that it's a return to much of the same. This made me laugh.

That's my rationale, anyway; if this post is felt to be inappropriate by the mods, though, I will gladly accept its deletion.

---

/r/MorbidReality is an unusual sort of place.  On the surface it seems like just a pretext for posting pictures of gore and death and atrocity and then upvoting them, but - unlike in subs like /r/Gore or /r/WatchPeopleDie - the *point* of the things posted in /r/MorbidReality seems often to be to cast a light on the frequently sad nature of our fragile lives.  Jokes are heavily discouraged, there, and the overwhelming key in which comments are made is that of quiet sympathy.

All the same, I was really surprised with how [this thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/1ad0gy/devout_religious_woman_brings_home_stillborn_baby/) has been turning out.  It contains several elements that would seem to demand a standard Redditor response: an apparently ""devoutly religious person,"" the treatment of a pre-born baby as though it were fully human, the unusual treatment of a dead thing, and more.

TL;DR: A grieving mother brings the body of a stillborn child home for her children too briefly ""meet"" before having the child buried.

My initial reaction on seeing 62 comments on this submission was to prepare for an incoming shitstorm; what I expected was something on the level of ""crazies gonna craze,"" if not worse. 

What I found inside instead was really, *really* surprising.

From the top on down:

&gt; *This getting reposted with a misleading title is frustrating. If you had bothered to read any of the comments you'd know that it's not anything to do with religion. She is grieving, and often it is encouraged to take photos with the child as a form of coping. Remember she was a mother likely very excited about a new baby.*

&gt; *She didn't take it home to ""treat it like a live baby,"" but to cope with her loss. The fetus was buried shortly after.* [+84]

That's... really honest and sympathetic and reasonable.

Has to be a fluke, right?

&gt; *Grieving is an individualized process. She conceived and carried the baby and her family has a right to grieve the loss in the way that they would like. Honestly, I don't see how this is much different from bringing children to a funeral.*

&gt; *That being said, I'm not sure why the photos were taken with the children and posted online. That's the part that's weird to me.* [+58]

Still being really sympathetic and honest and reasonable here, even if the latter part is politely incredulous.

We get to the third response and we're back to what we might have expected from the start:

&gt; *Calling that mom a deranged individual is an understatement. My mom had a miscarriage at home when I was 14. My mom was bleeding heavily. I was the only one there and had to put the baby in a shoebox. Seeing that fucked me up for a while.*

&gt; *Why would you put your other children through something like that?* [+42]

But many of the replies are (still polite) challenges to the assumptions in that comment!

The strange sensitivity continues on down the thread, with top-level comments alternating variously between incredulous (though usually fairly civil) replies and people offering highly-upvoted responses in contrary sympathy and support.  I would never have expected to see this anywhere on Reddit apart from in maybe one of the specifically religious subs.

There's three things about this thread that disturb me:

1.) Those pictures were hacked by some neckbeard, yet Reddit doesn't seem to be bothered by this obvious invasion of privacy (b/c invasions of privacy are OK if they help me masturbate, OK).  It's okay to invade Scarlett's privacy because she's a.) a celebrity, and b.) a hot woman, but shutting down OAG's AMA and getting your shitty ragecomic stolen by 9GAG are the worst miscarriages of justice in the history of civilization.

2.) Going off the previous point, Redditors seem to call it a ""victory"" if they acquire some famous (by both reddit or real life standard) female's nude pics, hence the ""Checked post history for /r/gonewild posts, was disappoint"", the photobucket hacking, jailbait, etc.  They take a perverse joy in acquiring said female's nude pics without consent.

3.) The first two points are terrible but are unfortunately fairly common in Reddit threads; however, this is the first thread I've seen so many redditors talk so fondly and proudly about masturbating.  I think this is indicative of the general downward trend in age among redditors (or, perhaps more disturbing, the juvenile disposition of many adult redditors).  For most people, the novelty of masturbating wears off in the late teens and early twenties - it's still widely practiced but is rarely mentioned or joked about.  Then I remember Reddit's a community of adults who get tangibly upset about video game endings and silly internet drama, and then I remember why the discussion resembles a chatroom full of seventh-grade boys.

And the Reddit community wonders why a legion of misogynistic basement-dwelling chronic onanists has trouble attracting women.  Look in the mirror, amirite?",,True,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_zw9a7,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/zw9a7/a_literal_circlejerk_in_which_redditors_fondly/,
1367262479.0,151,self.circlebroke,1dcti8,/r/games completely misses the forest for the trees and - in a twist that should surprise absolutely nobody - defends piracy.,wyschnei,223,72,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1dcti8/rgames_completely_misses_the_forest_for_the_trees/,"http://np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dbrmc/what_happens_when_pirates_play_a_game_development/

So, the article is about a company who made a game developer simulation video game (meta, I know). You build games, release them, make profits, and whatnot in this game. However, the developer wanted to put a little twist on it: copies of this game that were pirated had a built-in feature where, after your company got so popular, your games were pirated and you couldn't progress farther in the game, because irony, right? The point being made was that pirating media is great until you're on the receiving end of things. Yeah, the article is a bit of a shameless self-promotion, but it gets a point across, and effectively I'd say.

Can you see where I'm going with this?

As you can imagine, reddit defends the piracy and undermines the whole point of the article with irrelevant attacks towards the developer to justify their piracy.

Top comment at 352:

&gt;It buys them publicity on sites like this for a game that probably wouldn't have got any notice, otherwise. The story will do the rounds on various gaming websites as well and they'll pick up a lot of sales that way.

155:

&gt;I think of it like this: If a game is good, it will get pirated a lot, but it will also sell a lot.
If a game is shit, it will get pirated (probably not a lot, though), and it won't sell a lot.
If you go bankrupt because of that, you can't blame piracy, you can blame your shitty game. Don't worry, people will tell you what's shit about it. If you still blame piracy after that without listening to any of the hopefully valid criticism, maybe you shouldn't make games.
For me personally, piracy is like playing a demo (since nobody makes demos, anymore. All you get are videos that might not even reflect the reality of the game (which might also be true for demos that only let you play the most awesome part of the game and omit the bad ones, but at least you get to play them)). If I like the game, I'll buy it, if I don't, I won't.
Watching and reading reviews is fine, but sometimes it's not enough to convince me to buy a game.
The only downside here is that shitty games that are just jumping on the bandwagon of whatever is in style at the moment don't sell, anymore. Boo-hoo.

So if I owned a store and got robbed constantly, I should blame how shitty my product is? Seems legit.

Further down:

&gt;As a fellow amateur musician, just give your music away!
I just put my EP on bandcamp for free and had day one paid sales. If you are trying to play music professionally, then buy all means do what you need to make a living (most likely, tour your ass off an peddle merchandise) . But if you are simply an amateur musician supporting yourself through other means, just get your music out there whatever way you can so people can hear it.

Because that's how we stop a pirate culture - by actively promoting it and then getting surprised and angry when people decide to torrent something they should pay for.

&gt;You could either cry or you could see it a lot more constructive like the dev from Thomas was alone, with which I wholeheartedly agree.

&gt;Thomas getting cracked and put on pirate bay within 3 hours of release was genuinely one of my proudest moments. People wanted my game!
https://twitter.com/mikeBithell/status/328816701531648000

Yeah, okay, people want your game, but they don't want it enough to pay money for it? What?

Free games is cool and all, but do they realize that there are people on the other end who need to feed and house themselves? Don't think you're doing the world a service because you pirated a shitty game. You're just lazy and your part-time job at the local hardware store can't fund both your video game habit and your anime collection even though you live in your mom's basement. Try having to pay for things that actually matter, only to have your source of income actively being taken away from you by people who find it justifiable. And don't even start with the ""torrenting = publicity"" bullshit.

Not even that, she got convicted because she did that.

Most if not all people would say that it's worse enough to loose a child like that, extra punishment is just salt in the wound and a lot also would criticize the traffic planing for not making it possible to get over the road at a bus stop. But not on Reddit it is.

&gt; &gt; She attempted to cross the road from the bus stop, which is directly opposite her apartment complex, rather than walk a third of a mile to a traffic light, cross five lanes and walk a third of a mile back, lugging tired children and groceries.

&gt; So she walked across five lanes of traffic with a toddler and her arms full? 

No, she walked across five lanes of traffic because she had a todler and her arms full and didn't want to walk 15 minutes like that just to get to the other side.

My personal favorite would be this clusterfuck of ""traffic planers had nothing done wrong and how dare you to attack white people?""

&gt; Roads aren't ""built right through their neighborhoods"". This isn't the wild west where the white man comes in building a train.
&gt; These neighborhoods are typically really old sections of the city that used to be decent residential but as the town grew and the traffic increased the homes dropped in value and now poor people can afford them and move into them. Wealthy neighborhoods don't have main roads running through them because they were built after the main roads had already been established and were intentionally built away from them.

My favorite would be the ""law is the law""-comment:

&gt; Wrong. I walk pretty much everywhere; or take the bus. I live in Georgia actually, not too far from where this woman was killed. I would never cross a 5 lane highway with small children in tow at night. I would be super cautious crossing one by myself, night or day. She was grossly negligent; although she probably didn't deserve to be charged in light of the circumstances, the law is the law

Unless it's about pot, than the law is stupid and fucking your freedom.

But let's now finish for real with one of the posts that tried to break the jerk, but was overvoiced by the amount of the other posts laging any kind of empathy towards a mother who lost her child.

&gt; [I love how everyone just puts in their two cents without doing a little digging. Go see for yourself where the damn crosswalk is in perspective to the apartment complex. They put the bus stop there SPECIFICALLY for the people living there but didn't bother with a cross walk. So everyone going on about how the mother is stupid or at fault- let's analyze- you've got two small kids, you're on a bus with your two small kids and your groceries- do you get off at the bus stop, walk 3/10 of a mile to the light, cross, then walk the whole distance back to the complex (over half a mile!)? Of course not, you do the convenient thing (which is what was intended when they built the bus stop) and you try your best to carefully cross the highway.

The sheer number of bullies and douchebags on that sub is astounding, and the fact that they can't even keep their circlejerk on their own website is just obnoxious. Let's start off slow, and read some Reddit comments first. Their original post can be found [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/1f0vnr/a_serious_documentary_about_bronys_with_extremely/)

&gt;I was having trouble breathing just watching that big guy in the hall

This is exactly what I'm talking about. What's the joke here? The fact that the guy was fat. That's it. ""lol le fat guy XDDDDD""

&gt;I have no idea how he survived HS with that amount of social suicide
&gt;&gt;Because the bully movement has been weakened in recent years :(

I pretty much lost my shit here. /r/cringe, the bullying center of Reddit, is talking about the decline of bullying. HA HA HA. HA HA.  
HA.

&gt;How the fuck does this happen? It truly baffles me...this ""culture"" must be the greatest performance art piece in history because I refuse to believe it's real.

Yes, it's all just a joke. Not a single person on this planet likes things that you don't, or acts in a way you find dumb. They're all just joking.

&gt;If they could just admit it's a fetish, I wouldn't hate them nearly as much.

This is like saying that everyone who likes furries also faps to them. There *are* a lot of people who only follow the fanbase because it makes their dick hard, but the vast (or not so vast with furries, sorry) majority just like the artstyle/content. So, no. It's not a fetish.

&gt;It bothers me how much people make fun of these people. I know I'm going to get a ton of people down voting or disagreeing, but hear me out. If you look at these guys, you see that these don't look like the kind of guys who would walk around school holding hands with a girl, they look like the typical guys who get made fun of for everything. In my eyes, they're rejected kids, who found a group of people who accept them, and they're STILL getting made fun of for it, but at least they have the balls to stick with it.
TL;DR: Although I don't like the MLP thing, it's what makes them happy, and it's kind of shitty how much people bully them.

What's this? Someone being a decent human being? That can't happen! Luckily, /r/cringe was here to correct his ways.

&gt;You're worse than the standard bullies in a way when you pity them so openly. Maybe they COULD be average guys that held girls hands if they groomed better, dressed differently, and acted like adults.

If they act exactly like me, then I'll treat them like human beings.

&gt;Why is the video getting downvoted on Youtube?
&gt;&gt;Because it contains bronies.

First, regarding the actual article, why exactly is it necessary to erect a monument to how much you don't believe in something? Okay, you don't believe in god. Cool. Do you have to also kick sand in the face of people who do? Isn't it this kind of aggressive ""marketing?"" (I guess that's the right word...) that you decry christians for so often?

&gt;How long until a loving christian decides to vandalise it?  

Well, that's a nice top comment to kick of with, isn't it? I love how ratheists are tolerant, non judgemental people, until they get the chance to jab at those cretins who key atheist's cars. Yes, *some* Christians are intolerant, and will vandalize things they don't like, but do you really think that that's the majority? In the same way that most atheists aren't fedora wearing, dorito wielding fifteen year olds/neckbearded twenty year olds, most christians are not the Bible thumping car-keying vandals you assume they are. Oh, and don't think this was a fringe comment either.

&gt;It'll get vandalized.
Then taken down for ""cleaning"" by some no-bid monument cleaning contractor.
Then ""lost in transit"" never to be found again
Then the whole thing starts all over.
Or
Vandalized beyond recognition
Never investigated or investigated by Chief Wiggum
Then the state says we don't have money to keep repairing it
Then it gets taken down permanently citing ""eye sore""

You may remember his father, Kent Hovind, as being the founder/proprietor or the creationism museum in Pensacola, FL. And whom is currently serving the rest of his life in prison, with his wife, for tax evasion.

Ah, how could this news article that was intended to relay news through a news outlet forget to poke fun at /r/atheism's personal villain? Also, what does this guy's dad have to do with what his bloody son did to a monument? He's in jail! Was he supposed to break out and help/stop him? Why are you bringing it up?

&gt;im just really hoping he dies in there.

Yes, someone actually typed this. Someone decided that he would publicize his desire to see a man die in jail because he disagrees with his views. But wait! there's an edit he added!

&gt;Okay, allow me to rephrase that. *since he's an old man, and has does nothing but damage to science and education, and is an all around d-bag to his opponents, I kinda really hope he expires while sequestered from society so he cannot do any more harm than he already has.*

That's not a good reason. Besides, he hasn't done harm to science. He has insulted and/or misused it, yes, but he hasn't blown up any laboratories either. He's not exactly Osama Bin Laden. Hell, he's not even the WBC. He's just kind of an idiot. 

Now, there is hope for the subreddit, if you ask me. Comments like

So, when [something bad happens in India and it's brought up on /r/WorldNews](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1j9j6k/untouchable_student_in_india_beaten_to_death_by/), it's only natural that people would mention this.  I'm sure Reddit's foremost experts on Indian culture and society will have lots of insightful comments to make about the numerous problems plaguing India at the moment, right?  Let's check out some of these poignant insights, shall we?

&gt;can we blow this country up already?

Does anyone else find it rather ironic that Reddit loves the idea of blowing up brown people, yet constantly insists that AmeriKKKa is literally Hitler when it actually does so?

&gt;Hinduism - religion of peace.

Yes, because I'm sure that this kid was totally attacked in the name of Hinduism (which, by the way, *all Indian people follow*).  Even if he had been, that still wouldn't be a reason to condemn the millions of Hindus all over the world.  Then again, that's precisely what Reddit always does whenever someone of a certain race/religion/nationality they don't like does something bad.

&gt;India is a poverty stricken, over populated shit hole. This doesn't surprise me at all.

Just because it's not surprising doesn't mean that you should have absolutely no empathy for the victim in this case.  Also, what the hell do poverty or overpopulation have to do with a child being beaten to death by classmates?

&gt;Is someone trying to sensationalize the death by having caste involved (similar to Travyon Martin case in the US)?

TIL that Trayvon Martin was killed because of caste.  At least, according to that unenlightened mainstream media.

&gt;I really wish India would make up its mind if it want to be a 1st world country or a 3rd world country.

Most of the other music subreddits I have visited tend to be of pretty good quality, with some well-informed posts and they can even be very helpful for newbies trying to get into the genre/instrument/whatever-else (/r/classicalmusic is pretty good, as well as /r/jazz and /r/doublebass, etc), so I went into /r/guitar, wary of the usual guitarist attitude, but still optimistic.

This is going to be more of a discussion of the regular vibe of /r/guitar, and less of a focus on a specific thread, because the subreddit moves so quickly that threads often only receive a couple comments before disappearing down to page 2, with most of the same threads popping up almost daily.

/r/Guitar seems to be a perfect case of a bunch of pseudo-musicians who want to get really good at playing guitar, but without actually working at it.

&gt;[A little help tabbing this song](http://np.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1k2g8p/a_little_help_tabbing_this_song/)

This is a thread that pops up pretty often, and from what I can tell, it doesn't usually yield any of the intended results. You'll get a couple of comments stating how cool the song is, and if the tabs exist, someone will just post the link, which is something the OP could have just googled to begin with. 

This is pretty understandable, but the reality is with so many people begging to have more obscure songs tabbed, the fact is that those beggers are losing out on the opportunity to spend some time learning to transcribe the song themselves, which is a skill they're just hoping to mine from others.

&gt;[Posts like these pop up pretty much every day](http://np.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1k2cgr/i_just_want_to_play_help/)

These posts always boil down to ""I am self taught but I have no idea how to teach myself"" and the response is always ""get a teacher"", or links to various resources.

&gt;[""Passively teach me guitar reddit!""](http://np.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1k2j6q/help_with_stepping_up_my_writinglead_playing_feel/)

This thread I feel is the epitome of reddit's passive desire to improve on the instrument, but without doing any real work. I feel like these posters think they can just reach an epiphany by reading people talking about improving on the instrument. Notice the poster has basically provided the vaguest of requests in a list that ultimately boils down to ""teach me everything I need to know about modes and scales"", mistaking reddit for a search engine, where ""modes and scales"" would yield some actually useful results.

If the poster were actually interested in improving their own playing as the title suggests, the best thing they could have done is post a video of themselves playing so that we could actually see what exactly needs improving on.

Occasionally a person will ask whether or not it is ""worth it"" to learn music theory and guitar technique to become a better guitarist. Of course, anyone who wants to be good at anything should know that the best attitude to have is to WANT to learn everything there is to know about the subject, but reddit defies logic here by creating an echo chamber of amateur unemployed guitarists who insist that ""I didn't learn theory and it worked just fine for me!"", further convincing each other that they can do just fine without it. I won't post any links to these threads because I usually get personally involved.

Another common thread to post on this subreddit is to ask off-topic questions about playing in a band or discussing playing in bands. The posts almost never have anything to do with guitar save for the fact that there are guitars in bands.

Since then, I've become more and more disgusted with /r/technology's fascination of Google and condemnation of all other ISPs.

I've noticed that the jerk has become so bad that anyone who doesn't accept Google as their lord and savior gets downvoted to hell and back. Google Fiber threads are *full* of people spouting bullshit and projections about the service.

My last post was focused on debunking some common claims as well as showing off the jerk. This one is intended to be a bit of an expansion of the last one, but this time I'll be covering more subjects. This post will primarily cover the jerk itself and debunk common myths instead of primarily focusing on mocking individual comments like most submissions in here do.

I wrote about a third of this before remembering to disable automatic spellchecking, so if you notice some weird words that don't seem quite right, leave a comment pointing them out and I'll fix it.

So let's get started!

Wall of text warning: This post is roughly 4000 words long, there is NO Tl;Dr, either read it or don't read it, your call.

###Voting

It's clear that Google is popular in /r/technology. It's pretty much guaranteed that you'll see an article about them at least once a week, and articles bashing other ISPs are also upvoted quite a bit. Submitting an article about Google Fiber? As long as the headline is in their favor, it's pretty much guaranteed karma. I have abused this to gain several thousand points of link karma. If you average out the 5 major articles I've submitted about the subject, the actual average amount of upvotes is around 1581. I'd even go as far as saying that this is the biggest circlejerk on the site. Unfortunately, very few people seem to understand anything *about* the whole project. They just get excited at the prospect of 1Gbps without bothering to fact-check or think things through.

Articles bashing other ISPs also see a disproportionate amount of upvotes. The number one link of all time on /r/technology has the title ""Dear Google Fiber: Please, please, please rescue me from Comcast"". Now I can't resist dissecting this article, so let's take a quick look inside.

The author starts off by mentioning that he has network issues. Instead of calling his ISP to get them fixed, he decides that whining about his ISP is a better idea. He then compares his ISP to a girlfriend. It's already a terrible article. But then he starts talking about Google Fiber — praising them, whining about his service (which, ironically, is $66/mo and has both internet and basic cable, while Google Fiber with TV would be $120/mo plus fees — it seems that he isn't willing to pay for better TV unless it comes from Google). The entire article is nothing more than a poorly written blurb about Google Fiber and the author's personal wishes. And yet, redditors decided that it's worthy of being the number one post of all time on their technology subreddit — voted higher than articles like ""397-0. House approves resolution to keep Internet control out of UN hands."", ""Syria has disconnected from the Internet. All 84 of Syria's IP address blocks have become unreachable, effectively removing the country from the Internet."", and ""EFF wins renewal of exemptions to the DMCA for smartphone jailbreaking rights plus new legal protections for video remixing; ""If you bought your gadget, you own it, and you should be able to install whatever software you please without facing potential legal threats"""".

Even as I write this post, the number one submission on /r/technology is bashing TWC for saying that people don't really need 1Gbps. And this brings me onto the next topic of discussion…

###People don't really need 1Gbps

Say that phrase in /r/technology and you've just pissed off a sizable portion of the 2.6 million subscribers. It's like committing internet suicide. For some odd reason, redditors are obsessed with 1Gbps. Why?

Well, it's cool. There's no denying that. Do you know what else is cool? A Ferrari. Let's use the Ferrari analogy to explain why 1Gbps is useless! You see, you've just bought this Ferrari. It's fast. Very fast. But the speed limit is 55MPH. It's cool to show off to your friends, but uselessly overpowered for the task at hand.

If that wasn't clear enough, go read my previous post. Most servers can't even serve 100Mbps clients. Even torrents can have issues saturating that fast of a line. And, despite many projects intended to find a use for it, nobody has found a consumer use for gigabit internet beyond ""lol it's fast"". Of course, reddit finds a way around that argument…

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/19fo5k/you_dont_want_superhighspeed_internetsays_time/c8nmh81

&gt;Time warner is lying through it's teeth, because it KNOWS we DO, but it doesn't want to provide it when it can make so much on it's customers now. 

I think most of you can see the issue here. As I've already shown, 1Gbps is pretty much worthless right now. It's for bragging rights, not utility. But for some reason, redditors seem to think that it's essential.

Just for fun, let's look at ways that we could use 1Gbps with a 5-person family. Let's say Netflix suddenly starts offering 4k streams. Assuming they use the same compression that YouTube used to use before they pulled 4k support, that's a bitrate of 30Mbps per stream. Even with six streams running, that's only 180Mbps — you don't even need fiber for those speeds! DOCSIS 3.0 Cable systems can support up to 300Mbps with channel bonding, and DOCSIS 3.1 will support even higher. And again, we're looking at 4k — realistically, everyone would be streaming 1080p (roughly 7Mbps bitrate with Netflix's ""SuperHD"" option), so that's only 35Mbps.

And on a related note, h.265 will bring that number down to around 20Mbps per 4k stream. You'll be seeing mass adoption of h.265 within a few years.

You can argue all day about ways to saturate 1Gbps, but it's incredibly difficult to do. Torrents can saturate a nice chunk of it, but only if they're well seeded, and how much (LEGAL) torrent traffic does the average person use anyways? Most people are streaming and browsing the web, not downloading Linux ISOs, WoW, and the small amount of software with Torrent downloads as an option.

So really, the entire argument for 1Gbps boils down to ""I want fast speeds, even though I can't use them for most of what I do online"".

Of course, redditors are never happy with this quick of a conclusion, so they dredge out the ""ram argument"". See, someone may or may not have said something about 640k or 64k of RAM being all you'd ever need, way back at some point in the 90s. Nowadays, this (possibly completely made up) quote is used to justify gigabit fiber. But what these people don't seem to understand is that if this was true to the extent they're claiming it's true, you'd have **never** seen **any** innovation in technology. Nada. Zilch. If you actually had to have widespread adoption for a use, nothing would ever be invented. Let's look at electricity. It was useful far before widespread adoption. What about internet? That didn't require widespread adoption to come up with uses for it. And cars? Those were developed when roads were usually gravel paths or dirt, maybe cobblestone if you were lucky. So like all the other ""justifications"", it doesn't really justify anything.

…on the other hand, even this isn't enough to convince everyone.

&gt;I think the fact that people in Kansas City can rent out their houses just on the fact that they have google fiber shows that many people don't just want it, but are willing to go out of their way to get it.

Ah yes, I remember reading about that. Except as usual, the facts are exaggerated beyond belief.

###The shady side of Google's deal

Something a lot of people don't realize about Google Fiber is that their deal with Kansas City is shady in many ways. Here's a few quotes from the [Google-KCMO agreement](http://www.netcompetition.org/wp-content/uploads/Google-Kansas-Agreement1.pdf).

&gt;In consultation with City, Google will decide where to build the initial locations of the Project

Oh boy. Now this is a big one. Did you catch that?

&gt;Google will decide where to build

Yeah. They get to choose where to build out the fiber. Now I don't have the Kansas City cable franchise agreement, and can't find it anywhere online, so let's use my city's franchise agreement as an example, as this type of agreement is pretty generic.

&gt;5.3 Operator shall extend service to all residences within an annexed area adjacent to any portion of the City then currently served by Operator in which the density of homes is at least six (6) residences per 1320 cable-bearing feet (one-quarter cable mile) measured from Operator’s existing distribution system (excluding homes subscribing to direct satellite) within twelve (12) months of a request by residents of such area for service. In the event that such annexed area is served by another cable operator or its technically or financially infeasible at the time of such request, Operator will have the option but not the obligation to provide service.

Now one city is obviously not proof of anything, so here's New York's cable franchise agreement.

http://www.nyc.gov/html/doitt/downloads/pdf/time_warner_cable_franchise_agreement_brooklyn.pdf

&gt;5.3 Provision of Service: Subject to the exceptions set forth in Subsection 5.4 hereof, Franchisee shall make Cable Service available to all households in the Initial Service Area. Franchisee agrees that it shall not discriminate between or among any individuals in the availability of Cable Service or based upon the income of residents in a local area.

Damn! That's a hell of a lot different from Google's agreement! So there you have it — Google gets to deploy wherever they want, while, if the KCKS/KCMO Franchise Agreements are the same as the examples here, TWC is forced into covering the entire city. How again is TWC being ""beaten"" by Google when Google isn't even following the same rules?

But wait! There's more!

&gt;City will make space available to Google in City facilities for the installation of Google’s Central Office (“CO”) equipment and for additional network facilities, in locations to be determined as part of the design. In addition, City will provide power necessary for Google’s equipment at City locations. Google will install all equipment necessary for operation of its facilities. City will cooperate with Google in connection with all equipment matters under this Agreement, and will not charge Google for such space, power or related services.

&gt;Subject to City’s reasonable security measures and escort procedures, City will provide to Google and its contractors 24 x 7 access to Google’s network in City facilities so that Google may perform installation, operation, maintenance, replacement and repair functions. City will secure City locations via locked doors that trigger alarms in the event of unauthorized entry.

&gt;The parties will determine the timing for delivery of the necessary space for the Google equipment cooperatively as part of the Project planning. Location may be changed at the discretion of City to locations at least as suitable. In the event of such a change, City will cooperate with Google to allow for any necessary reconfiguration of Google’s network and the necessary move of any Google equipment. Any such change will be undertaken in a manner that is as least disruptive to Google’s operations as possible. The parties will negotiate in good faith to determine the appropriate cost responsibility.

&gt;City will not charge Google for access to City’s assets and infrastructure.

&gt;City will provide Google with access to assets and infrastructure of City, to the extent such assets or infrastructure are available and are needed for Google’s deployment of the fiber network. City will use its best efforts to make such assets available to Google upon request, on commercially reasonable terms. Such infrastructure may include, but will not be limited to, conduit, fiber, poles, rack space, nodes, buildings, facilities, CO locations, available land, and others (TBD).

&gt;City will not impose any charges for access to or use of any City facilities provided under this Agreement, nor will it impose any permit and inspection fees.

&gt;City will cooperate with Google in efforts to allow Google to gain access to poles and rights-of-way owned or controlled by third parties.

Additional notable obligations under the contract:

&gt;(c) Create a City team dedicated to the Project and allow Google to place Project employees in City office locations, working side-by-side with the dedicated City team.

&gt;(e) Provide access to assets and infrastructure, with no charges for such access.

&gt;(h) Use the dedicated City Project team to provide on-the-spot exception management where necessary to avoid delays in the Project.

&gt;(i) Provide a dedicated inspection team as part of the City Project team for inspection of all work performed on the Project. As part of this process, City will permit Google to use an approved third-party inspection firm to assist the City in completing necessary inspections in a rapid, timely manner.

&gt;(j) Allow Google to attach fiber on City poles, to the extent such poles are technically suitable and mutually agreeable for attaching a fiber optic cable.

&gt;(k) Provide Google with access to detailed GIS data and computer tools, including location information on all facilities owned by City and, to the extent available, those of third parties, with no charges for such access.

&gt;(l) Provide consulting assistance to Google on planning and build of the Project, as requested by Google. Such requests will be responded to in a timely manner sufficient to meet Google’s design and build requirements.

&gt;(o) Cooperate with Google on all publicity and public relations for the Project, including the obligation to obtain Google’s approval for all public statements or announcements related to the Project.

Holy shit! I don't see those provisions in New York's or Carbondale's franchise agreements! Google gets free &lt;everything&gt; from the government? Google gets to censor the government's words?

What was that argument I keep on hearing?

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/14gbzk/time_warner_cable_demand_not_there_for_google/c7cv802

&gt;God I hate cable tv/internet companies. So they admit they can provide faster speeds but the ""demand isn't there."" NO, the demand is there, just not at ABSURD prices. They won't even tell you the real prices on their website they are so bad. I was paying $60 a month for 25 mb/s. That's $10 less than Google fiber which gives 1 gb/s and other perks. Just a complete joke.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/18b0wz/why_us_internet_access_is_slow_and_expensive_how/c8da1yc

&gt;Google Fiber is the monkey wrench in the system that proves that their prices and speeds aren't derived from real, vigorous competition. GF comes into the picture and suddenly they're offering higher speeds at lower prices in the same areas? Why didn't one of them do it earlier? Surely one of them wanted to compete with the other because free market. Surely they wouldn't have colluded and made at least a tacit agreement to only compete with each other at the low end of technically available service possibilities while squashing competition from the high end until someone came along with so much money and influence that it couldn't be stopped. No, that's crazy.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/18b0wz/why_us_internet_access_is_slow_and_expensive_how/c8dhs4x

&gt;Google Fiber is a beacon of hope in these shitty times.

Hmmm. This doesn't quite look like much of a free market success, and I'm not surprised that national ISPs with [8.7 million internet customers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner_Cable#Services) are reluctant to destroy their current infrastructure, build everything with fiber, and somehow get the obscene city benefits that Google got from Kansas City in all the cities these ISPs serve.

So, yet again, Google's little success story is nothing more than a misleading lie.

I could go into further detail on this, but there's lots to talk about!

###The 97% myth

Anyone remember [this article](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/17y3d1/cable_companies_make_97_margin_on_internet/)? It's been quoted over and over again. People are convinced that all the big cable companies are raking in the cash.

Now I'm pretty sure that everyone on this subreddit can already see some flaws, but there's a simple and very big one that should be noted — if margins were this high, everyone would own an ISP!

We might already know that it's bullshit, but gullible redditors latched onto it and started quoting it wherever they can.

Search for the phrase ""cable distribution giants like Time Warner Cable and Comcast are already making a 97 percent margin on their ‘almost comically profitable’ Internet services"" (with quotes) in Google and you'll see an impressive 1200 results. Quite high for a 27 day old article, and this is just direct quotes!

The source for all this bullshit is MIT's David Talbot. On February 4th he published an article entitled ""When Will the Rest of Us Get Google Fiber?"" [link](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/510176/when-will-the-rest-of-us-get-google-fiber/?utm_campaign=newsletters&amp;utm_source=newsletter-daily-all&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20130205). 

&gt;In parts of the country, slower-speed copper, fast-download cable, and a few fiber networks are already built out. The cable distribution giants like Time Warner Cable and Comcast are already making a 97 percent margin on their “almost comically profitable” Internet services, according to Craig Moffet, an analyst at the Wall Street firm Bernstein Research. As Levin points out, “If you are making that kind of margin, it’s hard to improve it.” And most Americans have no choice but to deal with their local cable company.

Full halt!

&gt;according to Craig Moffet, an analyst at the Wall Street firm Bernstein Research.

Hmmm. I wonder where I might find information on this report of his.

http://dailycaller.com/2013/02/15/does-cable-really-have-a-97-profit-margin/

Aha! Talbot is a lying sack of shit who misquoted Moffet so that Talbot's article is nice and controversial. Case closed, party's over.

###The 140 billion dollar question

Another thing redditors like is the prospect of universal broadband. For some reason, they seem to think that everyone is entitled to 1Gbps broadband at $70/mo, so lots of people are suddenly in favor of a government-funded fiber rollout. As such, when an article claimed a nationwide rollout would cost $140 billion, redditors jumped on the bandwagon and started blindly citing the figure.

http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-it-would-cost-google-to-build-a-cable-network-2012-12

&gt;Building out the infrastructure will be expensive. In his September 17 report Still Bullish on Cable, although not blind to the risks, Goldman Sachs Telco analyst Jason Armstrong noted that if Google devoted 25% of its $4.5bn annual capex to this project, it could equip 830K homes per year, or 0.7% of US households. As such, even a 50mn household build out, which would represent less than half of all US homes, could cost as much as $70bn. We note that Jason Armstrong estimates Verizon has spent roughly $15bn to date building out its FiOS fiber network covering an area of approximately 17mn homes. The cost of ongoing test cases like this and the potential for significant cap ex investments also likely contributed to the company’s recent decision to issue non-voting class C shares in an effective stock split, in our view. Moreover, in the same note, Jason Armstrong also pointed out that Google’s TV offering represents the fifth (or higher) competitor in an already competitive market. All that said, while this initiative is clearly still in very early days, going direct to consumers with internet connectivity and video distribution could give Google the potential to become the end users sole channel for media consumption.

I see no 140 billion figure there. What's more, Verizon's costs for deploying FiOS are around $23 billion [[1]](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_13/b4221046109606.htm)[[2]](http://adage.com/article/news/verizon-s-23-billion-bet-fios-paying/136688/)[[3]](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/10/us-verizoncommunications-wireline-idUSTRE7796FV20110810)[[4]](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303703004577474491608119330.html)[[5]](http://www.econtech.com/newsletter/january2012/january2012a1.php), not 17 billion. 23000000000/17000000 = average of $1350 per home. 17000000000/17000000 = inaccurate average of $1000 per home.

Now we're looking at averages in Verizon's footprint here, not all over the country. Rural areas cost much more money than the cities and suburbs that FiOS tends to be deployed in. And, what's more, these per-home numbers are averages of Verizon's costs to pass 17m homes with only 5.4m hooked up internet customers. The much higher hookup rates for a national networks would drive costs up even further than $1350 per home.

Still, for the sake of debate, let's assume the economies of scale would make the average cost per home $1000. There are [115 million households](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=number+of+households+in+the+united+states) in the United States. Roughly 20% are rural. 80% of 115000000 is 92000000. 92000000 * $1000 is 92 billion dollars. That's just to cover all non-rural households, using the lowest possible per-home cost figures. In reality, per-home costs for 80% of the United States with realistic uptake numbers would probably be at least $1500 per home, meaning that 80% would cost 138 billion dollars. And that other 20%? The average cost per home for rural areas could be anywhere from $3000 to $10000 (ignoring the extremely hard to reach areas since those could cost hundreds of thousands each and would skew the numbers too far up). Even if it's $5000, that's 115 billion dollars right there. These numbers don't scale linearly, you can't lump rural and residential together under the residential rate.

So basically, incompetent reporters have manufactured a story of the 140 billion dollar fiber upgrade, an upgrade that would never be anywhere near that cheap to cover 100% of the nation. And, as usual, without even bothering to fact-check, redditors seized the story and used it to promote their wishful dream of 1Gbps fiber for everybody.

(on a side note, I find it hilarious that redditors think that universal fiber is more important than America's power infrastructure, roads, bridges, education, college, debt, financial crisis, etc)

###The international community

Ah yes, other countries. Here on /r/circlebroke there are many articles discussing the ""sweden"" jerk. On /r/technology, people like other countries for other reasons — they can compare them to the US and bash us for not being as fast on fiber uptake! Yay!

..and every single one of these people ignores the government-funded infrastructure projects that paid for the infrastructures used by those other countries, the censorship (china, korea), the terrible international speeds (effectively making many of these networks nothing more than a superfast country-wide LAN), the larger population density (gigabit may be $20/mo in Hong Kong, but a 40-square foot apartment is the hidden cost), the late adoption of the internet (it's easy to build out fiber when you don't have existing copper and coax), the smaller country size, and other inconvenient facts.

###The Dark Fiber Myth

What's that? Fiber is expensive to build out? Then why do we have all this dark fiber? I saw a news article a while ago about Google buying it, I bet they're using it for Google Fiber!

Nope. Nope nope nope nope. First of all, the vast majority of the dark fiber they bought was [backbone fiber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbone_network). It's not very useful for deploying residential FTTH. The primary reason they bought so much of it was for datacenter-to-datacenter private transport and for Google's CDN / free peering. Google themselves have confirmed this.

Case closed.

###Netflix's PR stunt

Way back in November 2012, Netflix published rankings on ISP speeds. As usual, they included all major US ISPs. But this time, they included… Wait for it… Google Fiber!

http://blog.netflix.com/2012/12/november-isp-rankings-for-usa.html

It's a blantant PR stunt. Google has very few customers, if they're ranking Google then they should rank muni networks like EPB as well as private companies like Paxio and Sonic.net, but instead they decided to only included Google. Of course, this thread took off a bit too fast on reddit, spawning a few highly amusing comments.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/14o98f/netflix_ranks_google_fiber_as_the_most_constantly/c7exr5v

&gt;I hope they start rolling out Google Fiber in more cities soon. This has the potential to finally restore some genuine competition to the broadband market.

""I hope Porche gives me a free car soon. This has the potential to make luxury car prices lower. Oh and I'll also be paying more taxes. The IRS guy said something about a grant to Porche to bring cheap luxury cars to the American public, but that's unrelated to my car, right?""

###Shills

""I disagree with you and have no way of matching your arguments, therefore you are a SHILL!""

&gt; How do you guys deal with christmas? I've always been a very, very anti-theistic person from very young age. My family is not of the religious kind, but they still celebrate christmas every year, as everybody does. It's always a nice evening, but somehow, I always feel very, very horrible about it. I feel like we're celebrating an event that led to a lot of terrible events.

Because, how can we possibly enjoy a time spent with family, sharing love and joy when we know that somewhere, sometime, someone did something bad. I too can't bear that thought of evil in my mind.

&gt; I've been trying to teach my family that it's really hard for me to come and celebrate because I think it's a terrible thing that we celebrate. I've never been taken seriously. I think my parents would be offended if I'm absent.

Please mom and dad, please don't force my skeptic mind to celebrate a holiday meant to be around love and peace, because I somehow relate it to the birth of a person I probably don't even believe ever existed and whom I happen not to like.

&gt; How do you deal with such kind of things? Does the ""family-bond"" justify celebrating a religious holiday? It's nice to get together, eat, give presents and get drunk. I have no problem with that. It's just the origin of the day that drives me insane

How can you possibly like being with your family and friends and not let it be about the birth of a person who never said anything other than 'love each other'.

Luckily he is soon met with joyful spirits that actually aren't completely retarded. [One brave soul](http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/159g14/how_do_you_deal_with_christmas_xpost_rtrueatheism/c7kjone) tells him it's all about winter's solstice. [Another](http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/159g14/how_do_you_deal_with_christmas_xpost_rtrueatheism/c7kfmpt) tells him he's getting worked up about absolutely nothing.

_______________________________________________________

In reality those are just side jerks. Typical for reddit and incredibly annoying, but not killer. What really got me about this was the fact that redditors love to give ridiculous parenting advice. Being a parent is a huge responsibility and the path you take in it can be dependent on so many things that it's very hard to say what is ""right,"" but of course reddit doesn't recognize this.

&gt;They are gonna fuck anyway so better for them to fuck in my house than some other potentially dangerous place

Ahhh yes obviously the only two options are let them fuck in your house or they go fuck on the slopes on Mt. Doom.

&gt;Yes, it's the taboos and red tape that make these things rebellious in the first place. These things really aren't a big deal until they're made a big deal by people doing them irresponsibly. 

Ok so lets no longer teach kids that running in the street is bad! That'll stop the rash of kids running into the highway.

&gt;God damn are you right. The moment I lost my viriginty, and the same with several friends the first thought was 'was that it? thats what the fuss was about?'

&gt;Sex is so overhyped in this society, when really, its just 2 people testing out the bedsprings.

Different people put different emphasis on different things? Not on reddit!

&gt;I think more people ought to think in this way, there shouldn't be such a taboo about learning and discovering your sexuality. 

Possibly, but some kids especially teenagers have different brain development that leads to more risk taking. However on reddit it's just a matter of being open and honest and things will work out for everyone.

&gt;Only an idiot would tell a teenager ""don't have sex"" and expect it to have any effect.

Of course nothing parents can do will have any effect.

&gt;Lost my virginity at 13 with my gf who was 13 at the time as well. She was on birth control and I spent about 3 nights/week at her place. The other nights we spent at my parents place. Her mother washed my clothes, sportsgear etc. when i stayed during the weekends, it was pretty chill. 

13 is the perfect time to lose your virginity.

Well, we all bitch, piss and moan fruitlessly about the decline of reddit.  And we all have varying opinions on when the decline started.  And argue about what is required to redirect the backward momentum and whether or not it can be.  But we all seem to justify our continued use of reddit by upholding that there is still some value to be found within the comment threads...

Maybe we just repeat this to ourselves often enough to believe it, but anyhoo...

Once upon a time, image macros were unwelcome.  On the boards I frequented back in the day, downvoting was not a feature; image macros just didn't get voted up.

Something changed, and the miracle technology of high-speed internet now yields animated gifs that reach new heights of quality and hilarity.  (The previous 'height of quality' set by an animated gif that was [advanced warning of shitty content](http://www.animatedgif.net/underconstruction/anim0205-1_e0.gif).  Now a reaction gif is the *excuse* for shitty content.

Or maybe [40 million ants can't all be wrong](http://gifsoup.com/webroot/animatedgifs1/3538095_o.gif), and reaction gifs are actually [the greatest](http://gifs.gifbin.com/092009/1252075488_muhammad-ali.gif) [innovation](http://www.unnecessaryumlaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/steve_jobs_book_cover_terminator.gif) [unleashed](http://1.media.todaysbigthing.cvcdn.com/80/70/a2f5910d5457b92d821236d02d6c3d85.gif) since [sliced bread](http://freezone.photoimpact-international.com/images/food/food-bread-maggie.gif)^1.

Well, subscribers to this educated, highbrow, in-the-know commonwealth we call Reddit have sanctioned reaction gifs with reckless abandon and the most upvoteliest approval.

Now we can come full circlebroke:

Redditors are branding reaction gifs specifically for reddit use:

Yep!  ORIGINAL CONTENT!

Original content with the loosest interpretation of the word ""original"" ever applied.  Here's a good example of [[OC]](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/x4i3c/i_animated_a_downvote/).

I saw quite a few more of these inappropriately applied [[OC] labels](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/yys7u/made_a_new_downvote_gif_oc/) as I searched.  Obviously, [OC] means that whenever you see ""[OC]"" in a post, do this: http://i.imgur.com/cOhmI.gif

These reddit-branded gifs seemed to be a recent trend to me... I've only noticed these upvote/downvote gifs overrunning Reddit just within the last month or so.  In my diligent research for this investigative expose, I of course checked /r/gifs, which lead me to /r/reactiongifs... but then I was directed to a new community of only 27 days: /r/upvotegifs.^2

So we've got ~~a~~ subreddit~~s~~ designed to create reaction gifs meant to be posted in comment threads, the byproduct of which stop meaningful discussion dead in its tracks.

So far I've only seen downvote gifs used against trolls in bottom-of-page hidden comments.  They are upvoted comparably with the downvotes of the trolling OP.

But it's only a matter of time before they're routinely used to respond to actual comments... and then it's a battle.  Will reddit find the discussion comment worthier than the reply gif immediately below it?

I'm pretty certain these gifs will ultimately facilitate the decline of Reddit comment threads at an exponential rate.

Any of you who believe that comment karma is where it's at... you better start making gifs.

We can all agree that the [rape thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x6yef/reddits_had_a_few_threads_about_sexual_assault/) was a bad idea. After a week, we managed to put it behind us and lock it away in the reddit vault of shame; only to be mentioned in hushed tones and glazed-over blank stares...*yeah, I was there...*

But no. There was still a gratuitous amount of karma left untapped. What this called for was an [anti-rape-jerk.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xf5c2/reddit_are_you_aware_how_dangerous_the_askarapist/) Reddit apparently required a separate thread to reassure itself that it knows that rape is wrong... and now it has the endorsement of a medical professional to justify it.

And what was the take-away message of said medical professional?

&gt;Now, when Reddit invites rapists to retell their stories, they offer an audience of thousands. The possibility that individuals reading these stories will be horrified afresh is very appealing to some rapists.

&gt;...the Reddit rape forum is very likely triggering rape cravings in rapists.

So what does reddit do?

* ""I was absolutely sickened upon viewing that thread.""

* ""That thread pissed me off more than anything.""

* ""It was fucking disgusting.""

Yeah, they go ahead an do the very thing that was supposedly so damaging about the previous thread. Not only are people showing their disgust all over again, but people are even *reposting* their personal rape-victim stories from the first thread. This is basically the rape thread all over again, but without the rapists point of view.

And, above all else, this is all just an exercise in back-patting. ""Yeah, rape is so wrong! Those rapists are bad people! The thread was terrible!"" The title of the post might as well have been **DAE Think rape is bad?** Yes, we get it; you are a decent human being, congrats.

[Men's Rights](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xf5c2/reddit_are_you_aware_how_dangerous_the_askarapist/c5ltusu) makes a cameo and reminds everybody that men can be raped too, and somebody likens the rapethread to r/jailbait which of course spins off into it's own ""[DAE think pedos are bad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xf5c2/reddit_are_you_aware_how_dangerous_the_askarapist/c5ltunm)"" jerk.

All in all, very solid jerking going on in there.

Nope!

&gt;Hell, everybody believed in eugenics in those days, including a lot of progressives. It was the in thing up until WWII kind of gave it a bad stench.

That's the top comment as of now. Thankfully, not everyone is as supportive.

&gt;while cultural relativism is important for context it still does not make shitty things ok. 

There are some people fighting back, so at least we have that. However, this is the top reply to the top comment.

&gt;Hitler ruined eugenics for the rest of us.

Holy shit, I don't even know what to say. 

And here comes another guy lacking any self awareness.

&gt;Why would anyone be against eugenics?

Yeah, I can't think of any reason why eugenics could go wrong. /s

Moving on...



&gt;&gt;The year 2100 will see eugenics universally established. In past ages, the law governing the survival of the fittest roughly weeded out the less desirable strains. Then man’s new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. As a result, we continue to keep alive and to breed the unfit. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct. Several European countries and a number of states of the American Union sterilize the criminal and the insane. This is not sufficient. The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.

&gt;Wow. We have to keep in mind though, that this was all expressed in a time before World War II. Eugenics wasn't seen as such a malign crime against humanity back then. Google Sweden + Eugenics to find out why exactly the swedish people have such handsome faces...

&gt;I doubt that Tesla understood the scope of the atrocities that were being committed in Europe (and at the hands of the California eugenics movement[1] ) at the time.

&gt;However unpleasant the idea of eugenics is to reasonable people on its surface, this notion seems particularly strange coming from a man like Tesla, whose own mental illnesses[2] would have likely put him in the “undesirable” category under any authoritarian regime.

In case you missed it.

&gt;Google Sweden + Eugenics to find out why exactly the swedish people have such handsome faces...

This comment was so bizarre and of course brought in the ""Europeans are beautiful"" jerk that I had to point it out. Apparently eugenics is bad but thank god the swedish did it so we can admire their faces. 

I've already gotten a lot so I'll just quote some of the more awful ones.

&gt;1. Hitler's implementation of eugenics was radically flawed. It isn't an inherently bad idea.


&gt;2. I like the concept of eugenics and think it should be practiced today.

&gt;3. Honestly if they could make it 100% reversible, all males should be sterilized before they turn 13. No more 'oopsies'. It will have to be consensual to have children.

&gt;4. The fact remains he is partially correct, it's only a matter of time before we overpopulate earth, this seems like a reasonable solution. (Look up the overpopulation experiments by John B. Calhoun, and the Behavioral Sink) Imagine how much more threatening jail would be if violent felonies were not only punishable by jail time but by sterilization.

And arguably the worst:

&gt; Every single person in here who is bashing Eugenics is a fucking moron. Sorry, but someone has to say it.

&gt; There IS a genetically ""superior"" pool of individuals out there. This is simply a fact of biology, that some people have superior genetics to others for surviving in the world we live in. What traits these are, what genes they carry, where they're located, these are all questions we have yet to answer. But the fact remains that there is a quantifiably better set of genes out there, and we could and should promote the spread of those genes in the population while trying our best to cut down on undesirable genes by providing incentives for those who don't reproduce.

&gt;First step is of course identifying what is superior, by analyzing the world we live in, the demands it places on us to survive, and then by going through the genome to systematically isolate and promote genes which benefit us in life. Genes which promote muscle growth, genes which are less prone to cancer, genes which increase cognitive function, etc...

&gt;The only thing is, we need an unbiased way of determining what is ""best"". My idea? That new IBM simulated brain. Once we improve that and can create functional AI we can use a completely unbiased computer to determine all the variables which humans need to contend with and come up with a list of genes which should be promoted/phased out in order to optimize humanity for life in the most efficient way possible.

&gt;Everyone bashes Eugenics using the slippery slope argument, that because Hitler was a whack-job who took things to an extreme we should discount the entire notion that we could control our population's genetics for our own good. Many other species engage in eugenic activity, either by letting the weak die naturally or by killing them outright, but we are alone in our decision to not only sustain the life of those with clearly inferior genes, but also to promote their reproduction.

I've gotten to point where I'm not even angry anymore, just sad. No matter how many times it's refuted, redditors still believe something that no decent person should in this day and age. I hope its just some kind of ""edgy rebellion"" but of course it's hard to tell. Feel free to look through the rest of the comments. There are a couple of people fighting against the jerk.

In case you've never heard of Bitcoin, here's how Simple English Wikipedia describes it:

&gt;Bitcoin is a digital currency. It was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike most currencies, Bitcoin does not rely on a central issuer, like a bank or government. Bitcoin uses a log across a peer-to-peer computer network to record transactions. Bitcoin's design allows for anonymous payments online.

That just about covers the basics. The fun part is, the exchange rate between Bitcoins and USD is unfixed, so people like to speculate on it. The result is violent swings in price, which just results in more speculators, and so on.

Bitcoin may well be a swell idea - I don't know enough about economics to say. However, the face that the Bitcoin community is presenting to the world is less than stellar. Here are a few trends I've noticed:

The lack of respect for people who don't understand the technology well enough to get involved: [Here's someone lamenting Bitcoin for not being 'idiot-proof'](http://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1bupy9/problem_bitcoin_is_not_idiotproof/) implying that anyone without a stack of IT certifications must be an 'idiot'. If you stick around r/bitcoin long enough eventually you'll come across a non-ironic use of the word 'sheeple'.

The use of 'supply and demand' as a thought-terminating cliche to dismiss suggestions that the market is capable of behaving irrationally: [Here's an example from right before this week's price crash.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c152w/i_dont_think_weve_yet_discussed_very_simple/) A market is not a mathematical function that you can enter two variables into and get a predictable result every single time.

As a junior in college majoring in elementary education, this was an interesting clip to me. I haven't worked with high school kids, but based on what I've learned and my own experiences, I can understand where the teacher in this clip is coming from. Escalating the situation in front of your entire class by entering a debate with this student would be counterproductive (again, this is based on what I've learned/experienced), all it leads to is the class falling more off-track and the potential for an even worse situation. I think she made the right call in continually telling him to leave, cut off the confrontation before it escalates. I personally would have told the student I'd love to discuss my methods with him outside of class, but that this wasn't the time or place. In the heat of the moment though, I can still understand why she just went with the safest route.

I wonder what Reddit thinks?

&gt;This is a perfect example of a young mind thirsting for knowledge and an apathetic teacher who just wants a paycheck who does not care. This kid deserves a medal for standing up for what is right. [+2030]

Uh...that's a HELL of an assumption of all the parties involved, and a broad, borderline cringeinducing, over-glorification of the student in the video. How do we know this teacher just throws packets at her students and never actually teaches, because one, obviously biased, student thinks otherwise? Because holy crap if that isn't a generalization of the worst degree But yeah, throw medals and stuff at him, he doesn't like school just like me!! This out-of-context clip says it all about that teacher's methods and personality! That comment sits at 2030 upvotes by the way, with Reddit Gold of course.

&gt;I hate the ""bye"" response from the teacher, she had no idea how to counter his argument. she's straight up, lazy. [+1850]

&gt;Yeah, her lack of regard for his argument seems to prove his point. She's a lazy, unmotivated, apathetic person. [+845]

I covered why I don't think her response was a bad one in my intro, but again, Reddit continues to completely judge how awful this lady is based on a short clip of an unhappy student. I can definitely psychoanalzye this teacher and just tell how horrible of a person she is based on this commentary from a biased source! The next comment in the thread made me facepalm the hardest.

&gt;Everyone in that classroom looks lazy. They aren't doing anything but just sitting around! [+281]

People sitting in a classroom? Woah, no fucking way, get out of town. I love hands-on learning as much as the next person, but are they seriously reaching THAT far to shit on the teacher further? Did they need there to be a unicycling bear in the background complete with a breakdancing troupe to decide, ""Well, this woman is lazy and apathetic, but damn if she knows how to run an interesting class!""?

&gt;Good for him. He understands the value of his education and the position he is in as a youth in his country. [+341]

Basically, ""so brave"", with some buzzwords thrown in to make the student sound incredibly noble. Every other comment in the thread is basically the same.

Now, I'm not saying the student is obviously wrong or the teacher is obviously innocent. There is probably something at work in the class to make the student say the things he did so passionately, and it's easy to knock the other party down when she gives the safe response while the other repeats a lot of the same thoughts we had as students in the public school system. I just don't appreciate how quick to judge we are a person's entire character on the words of a disgruntled student, whose claims we don't even know are well-founded.

However, this hadn’t stopped me for about a year of enjoying reddit (I mean, you don’t have to be a le STEM major or atheist to like cat pictures and funny gifs).

However, recently I’ve come to realize that there are some really awful and strange people on this site to the point where I can’t ignore it anymore. There are also structural issues with the site itself that aren’t being addressed anytime soon. I’d rather not give any page views to reddit so I'm going to stop visiting this site altogether (even though I don't come here that often in reality), and in closing I thought I’d offer a rant to this community, which is seemingly one of the most moderate and tolerant ones I’ve found on this site (besides maybe, like, /r/swimming or something). I’ve split my rant into three categories so that you may more easily follow it and hopefully you’ll find it interesting. I’ll try not to ramble.

**AMA’s Ruined by Immature Redditors and Bad Moderation**

When I heard Dennis Miller, formerly of SNL and currently a FNC contributor, was having an [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/171ct5/iam_dennis_miller_comedian_and_political_talk/), I was excited to come see. However, to my disappointment the AMA was hijacked by [Tim Heidecker](https://twitter.com/timheidecker)’s followers on twitter.

[This guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/171ct5/iam_dennis_miller_comedian_and_political_talk/c81gquw) explains it well:

&gt;A comedian named Tim Heidecker, who is the Tim from ""Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job"" and Tom from ""Tom Goes to the Mayor"" hosts a podcast called 230PST. On his twitter account last night he posted that Dennis Miller was hosting a reddit AMA and encouraged followers to comment and hashtag ""#230PST"" at the end of all their questions. I am not 100% sure why Tim did this, or what beef if any he has with Dennis Miller, but Tim's followers COMPLETELY had this thread hijacked within 2 hours (like, more than half of all comments had #230PST at the end of them) and it was completely ruined.

From my understanding it was a light hearted prank which I have absolutely no problem with, but it also could have been stopped by the mods before it got out of hand and the AMA still could have been successful. One of them, however, chimes in [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/171ct5/iam_dennis_miller_comedian_and_political_talk/c81d1x1) and says he’s not going to do anything, and gives a tongue in cheek remark about capitalism while he’s at it:

&gt;Mod here -- it's a bit of a gray area as to whether non-abusive questions should be deleted, particularly when the users are rampantly upvoting them. While we have pretty strict rules for AMA topics, we are generally more laissez-faire about comments. To put it in libertarian terms, we've deregulated to allow the invisible hand of the market decide.

Redditors in a unique case are understandably annoyed:

&gt;actually what you've done is further establish the precedent that it's o.k. to massively troll someone's ama. 

And eventually after enough backlash he changes his mind, but not before the AMA is pretty much ruined. The comment section is a graveyard of deleted posts, people asking what’s going on, and some decent questions for Miller. Unfortunately, what could have been a cool thread is a let down because of bad moderating.

The second AMA I want to point out is [NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17fylz/iam_roger_goodell_nfl_commissioner_ama/) that was done today. For those who don’t know, Goodell has made some decisions as commissioner that were controversial (dealing with player fines and changes to the rules that address safety) and a lot of fans don’t like him. So, although this is a very high profile person, redditors ask terrible questions and proceed to pretty much insult the guy.

The subreddit /r/nfl made a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/17g0mb/the_roger_goodell_ama_is_a_fucking_joke_i_wish_it/) that was titled “The Roger Goodell AMA is a fucking joke! I wish it was done in /r/NFL. Then, less trolls and assholes would've known about it.”

There are dozens of bad upvoted comments, but this [user](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/17g0mb/the_roger_goodell_ama_is_a_fucking_joke_i_wish_it/c855y4o) offers an insight into some of the really shitty ones that got upvoted.

&gt;I posted this in the other thread and I'll do it here too:

&gt;Some of the top (score of 100 or more) ""questions"":

&gt;you suck

&gt;do your parents know you suck cock?

&gt;Is your asshole jealous of all the shit that comes out of your mouth?

&gt;Why are you literally hitler?

&gt;If Jonathan Vilma and a dog were trapped in a car on fire and you could only save one of them, what would you name the dog?

&gt;WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?!2

&gt;How high are your socks right now?3

&gt;How do we impeach you?

&gt;Fuck you Goodell.

&gt;Roger, I would like to reiterate that I hate you. And so does everyone else.

&gt;This is why we can't have nice things.

&gt;Edit: Adding more as we go.

&gt;This one was posted by NOS and was kinda funny
&gt;This was posted by ""SocksOnAnkles"" (a 0-day old account)
&gt;Followed by this response: 
&gt;[7] or higher I'd say

He ends up answering like a dozen questions overall, which isn’t that many
What I don’t understand is that it seems like the people who own reddit should care about things like this because it’s a huge marketing opportunity for them and it reflects poorly on the website when things like this happen. But the owners stay true to their hands off style and just let the mods do whatever they please. Maybe I’m missing something but this seems like such a big structural issue on this website- that some nobody with mod privileges can “run” high profile celebrities like this with no control. Just look at /r/atheism and how trashy and bad it is, even though a subreddit about atheism obviously can be good.

**Bizarre Political Arguments**

There are a lot of things that redditors jerk about nonstop that I could discuss here, and they include Papa Johns, SOPA/ACTA/YMCA, and Westborough Baptist Church, but I’m just going to keep it to something that I know circlebroke is familiar with and that I don’t especially understand the hype about- male circumcision.

This subject and the politics behind it are probably about as important to me as Beyonce lip-syncing at the Inauguration or the fact that some random redditor had a Star Trek themed wedding complete with a life size portal guns and two disappointed parents in the pews. I didn’t even know really what it was somewhere in my mid-teens and I keep spelling it ‘circumsicion’ because I don’t think I’ve ever had to type it out before right now. But for some reason on reddit **it will not go away**.

Like [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/16rsuy/okay_seriously_wtf/), or [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/170tzo/what_is_the_creepiest_thing_that_society_accepts/c815hrb), maybe even [here in  big subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/15oyti/til_in_somalia_95_of_females_face_genital/), or [here in smaller ones.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/16xqqe/religious_tradition_more_like_penispenispenis/).

You get the picture.

Not to mention these threads are all within the last week, and if you search it there are a [few dozen](http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/search?q=circumcision&amp;sort=new) topics on it in the last 3 days, albeit none get much traction. 

If I talked about circumcision in real life as much as redditors do here, I would have no friends. But for some reason, people on this website discuss it nonstop. Look, it get that it can be bad and that I don’t want to be on “the wrong side of history”, but in the end who cares? The ratio of how much it affects men to how much it is discussed is way out of proportion, and eventually its going to go away so it doesn’t warrant this much discussion. And it’s harmless until people from Men’s Rights start saying how it’s comparable to female genital mutilation, which seriously fucks up women who undergo the mutilation. It’s almost infuriating.

“Well why don’t you go to /r/conservative or /r/libertarian you stupid fundie?” you might say, and my respond would be “Have you seen those places? They’re terrible.”

The libertarian subreddit mentions 1984 more than anyone who isn’t a conspiracy theorist should ever mention (check out /r/panichistory if you don’t believe me) and the conservative one is devoid of good discussion. The one mod keeps calling liberals “libtards” which isn’t productive and is the kind of offensive stuff I don’t go to /r/politics for. He is even the moderator of a subreddit called /r/libtards, I kid you not.

For an example of the lack of content, when those Americans were being held hostage in Algeria last week there were ZERO posts about it. There were however like 20/25 that were about guns and gun control. I mean, its pretty big fucking news. Twitter had better coverage of the event than reddit did because it trended so often. Think about that.

**Redditors Bullying Kids**

The first two points are pretty much harmless, but this is the straw that broke the camel’s back for me. Even though I’m literally Hitler since I’m a fundie right-winger, I don’t tolerate bullying small children that well. However, I cannot escape from people making fun of kids on this website. And some of them are really cruel.

For example, this one, which makes me angry. [Some ~13 year old girl posts a picture on facebook with some upper lip hair](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/175y1x/classic_vidya/) and someone posts it to /r/cringepics. Comments include:

&gt;www.dollarshaveclub.com [+149]

&gt;She has more facial hair than I do [+75]

&gt;Looks kind of like Nigel Thornberry [+30]

Nothing cringey about this picture, just bashing a little girl.

[This guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/17duts/she_looks_really_into_it_bro/) from the same subreddit posts a pictures of a kid with a physical handicap (FAS?) and got over 1000 upvotes of people “cringing” at him.

&gt;That kid lost the genetic lottery HARD [+381]

&gt;The Spartans would have thrown him off a cliff [+130]

&gt;His face looks like the new kill me now face [+102]

In /r/rage people are raging over [some kid](http://www.reddit.com/r/rage/comments/15q1m0/such_a_punchable_face/) who can’t be over 14, and by “raging over” I mean calling him a douche:

&gt;Word of the Day: Backpfeifengesicht (German) Means:A face badly in need of a fist. [+130]

&gt;The longer I stare at this, the angrier I get. What a stupid fucking ""pose."" He looks like he rehearsed it for hours in the mirror before going out. Also, he looks like a girl. What a baby back bitch. [+25]

&gt;I would love to rip that little fucker's tongue right out of his mouth. [+4]

And finally, a really bad one I saw in a circlebroke post was a guy [justifying school shootings](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/17g8e4/askreddit_commenters_3_school_shootings/). Read the original post to see some really terrible bullying, but the counter bullies are also terrifying. This one in particular [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17fbmq/whats_the_worst_thing_youve_witnessed_someone_do/c851mbd):

&gt;The people that do act on those feelings [of shooting up a school] aren't bad people either. They're ignored and allowed to spiral out of control people. [+34]

I was taught morality in a fundie prison (Catholic school), but I remember being taught that the ends doesn’t justify the means. And I mean, I always thought that was for like cheating on a test, but I think it might apply to this too. I’ve got to draw the line in moral relativity somewhere, and this went way past it.

Now, I am not saying that this is a bad thing. I am nowhere near well-informed enough to pass judgement on the state Uruguayan politics and economics. I suspect that, in this trait, I am similar to the bulk of Reddit.

Clearly not [r/Pics](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics), however. [In this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/130lzg/good_guy_jose_mujica_he_is_the_poorest_president/), a random picture of President Mujica, given a title stating his charitable nature, has spawned a massive pro-Mujica jerk.

Yes, Uruguay has a monopoly on political leaders who care about the people.

&gt; This is the longest video I have ever watched that was in Spanish since Pan's Labyrinth, and it held my attention the entire time. This guy seems like a genius. Especially on the part about India have the same car:family ratio as Germany, and if we would still have Oxygen to breath.

That was in response to a speech that was linked by another comment.

&gt; That's the best thing I've watched all weekend. Thanks for sharing! I wish there was a politician in the UK who was talking about this stuff as frankly. Even if they couldn't pull of this guy's delivery. Which is pretty bloody good.

Ditto.

&gt; MUJICA'

So creative.

&gt; This is a man who cannot be bought.

Blanket statement with no evidence, but perhaps true.

&gt; His country also legalized weed and abortions. YAY!

Uruguay is le paradise.

&gt; He is also an open atheist.

Therefore = awesome.

&gt; This man made Uruguay the global powerhouse it is today.

Global powerhouse?

&gt; This makes our politicians look even worse than they do with their gridlock, constant arguing and incessant ability to be lobbied into voting for the highest bidder

American politics reflects a different political system, society, and nation than Uruguay.

&gt; MUJICAAAA.... FUCK YEAH !

And on and on.

Some actual Uruguayans join the fray as well. Some are quite negative. Surprise, surprise, perhaps Mujica is not a god, and perhaps Uruguayans, like Americans, have differing opinions on their political leaders.

&gt; I live in Montevideo, and it's a great place, but Mujica is not a great president.
Uruguay needs a free trade agreement to get out of Mercado Sur desperately (and a nuclear power plant). The energy costs are absolutely ridiculous down here (gas is ~$9/gallon) and 1 KWH of electricity is about 0.21USD

http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/130lzg/good_guy_jose_mujica_he_is_the_poorest_president/c6zumx1

&gt; As an Uruguayan it is very strange to see such praise of my president on reddit.
Most Americans see a humble pot legalizing man and just rush for the upvote button. This is a mistake, as he is not a very good president. Humble and somewhat honest, yes, but he is not ready to negotiate with the big boys. Every time he goes to Argentina to negotiate something with Christina Kirchner Uruguayans lose something. She plays him like a fucking violin and its so sad to see.

http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/130lzg/good_guy_jose_mujica_he_is_the_poorest_president/c6zvbid

&gt; Are you joking? As someone that LIVES in Uruguay (moved from the US to here a year ago) allow me to correct your BS.
Mujica and Chavez have been close the last few years, and many of his reforms have slowed down the bustling Uruguayan economy (which grew at 9% GDP last year).
Mujica's made several sweeping changes to our healthcare system that has caused massive problems, lines, and also many people are going with worse care cause of it. Additionally, though some things he's done are good, there's been more strikes in the last few years than there's ever been, and it's caused massive public transit issues, trash pick up issues etc.
The middle class in Uruguay is actually shrinking, despite the growth here of late. The lack of ability to capitalize off the influx of new business (and now OIL) is Mujica's greatest weakness. People here are not a big fan of his... He also violated the laws here to get elected in the first place, as he was part of the old dictatorship and they are prohibited from running in elections.
Marijuana reform was seen as a big smokescreen by most of the people I know here, to hide the issues funneling money into energy production, which is OIL based in Uruguay (they desperately need a nuclear power plant, as energy here is so expensive).

http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/130lzg/good_guy_jose_mujica_he_is_the_poorest_president/c6zumcn

&gt; As a Uruguayan, I can't believe you are actually supporting this clown. He is an incompetent president who has destroyed the years of buildup of regional international relationships of the country in favor of relationships with countries such as Venezuela, has been using this social policies which I actually agree with(gay unions, marijuana, etc) to lead attention out of the economic disasters this government has caused, and has done so much retarded shit I could spend a week explaining it.
Oh, and regarding the ""good guy"" part, did I mention the fact that he used to be a terrorist who bombed civillian populations, violently robbed banks and casinos and belonged to the group that triggered the 12 year dictatorship our country had? Yeah, great guy.

Among the comments is a cherry picked from /r/bestof: an [""interesting contrast to the view that women are the only ones who suffer from the media's reinforcement of some ideal image.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/10ftr4/rsonw_describes_how_men_view_their_own/) Let's break down the comment in question.

&gt; You've likely been told you're beautiful, hot, etc. by men and boys from a young age. You've seen men and boys blatantly check out your body from a young age. **Men way too old to be looking at you that way saying things they shouldn't be saying.** And while the media bombards you with the message that unless you're a 5'10"", 115 pound waif, you're fat; unless you wear Maybellene, you're ugly; **men will tell you and show you that you are, in fact, attractive. It's been going on so long that it's just annoying now, but it happens.**

You women have been undeservedly crept on and hounded for centuries, why can't you see that we're just trying to show you that you're attractive? Chivalry is fucking dead.

&gt; Now, imagine if no man ever looked at you your whole life. No man ever told you how pretty you look today. You can count on one hand how many times a man has looked at you or complimented you in that way. 

Imagine a world, surrounded by four walls and a stack of pizza boxes, the only loving glow eminating from your computer screen, under the fascist authority of your life-bearer...

&gt;**But, dig this, the media's still telling you you're unattractive. The difference now is that you have constant reinforcement that they're right, they're absolutely right.** 

So apparently not being called attractive is equivalent to being called unattractive by everyone ever.

&gt;No man truly finds you attractive, your boyfriends and lovers just told you you are because that's what they're supposed to do. That's what being a man is like. Women don't tell us we're attractive out of the blue. Women don't stare at us. And the media tells us that without P90X we'll forever remain unattractive. **And we don't receive any contrary experiences.** Girlfriends and lovers tell us we're attractive because that's what we want to hear, not because it's true.

Firstly, the last sentence reeks of insecurity. The reason you're not being called attractive or complimented on has nothing to do with your gym regiment or the amount of money you have. It's about how you carry yourself. If a man walks around looking and feeling unattractive or sorry for himrself, people will look at him that way. Weak, unwilling to change for his own sake, and devoid of what is required in a relationship. If a somewhat goodlooking woman is depressed, thinks no one cares for her, and thinks she's ugly, god damn it as a Reddit White Knight I must take it upon myself to put this woman on a pedestal, for then she might bestow her fertile vagina upon my neckbeard and become my own OAG.

Let's just look at some more comments in the r/bestof thread, which continues the ""As a man, woe is me"" jerk.

* The top comment is deviated by a girl who is wondering, ""[Can I tell a guy that he is attractive without it seeming that I am hitting on him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/10ftr4/rsonw_describes_how_men_view_their_own/c6d5bib) Reply: ""...something like 'That shirt looks good on you' is far more than we usually get."" Probably because you don't wear a shirt that looks good on you, or there is nothing under that shirt that is desirable, or because women don't care about your Tshirts. Another user sums it up nicely: [""...giving compliments to men that never receive them could give them the wrong idea.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/10ftr4/rsonw_describes_how_men_view_their_own/c6d6516)
* [""... people measure guys by other factors too. Financial success, sense of humor, fashion, etc. What a guy lacks in physical attractiveness, he can definitely make up for with the other factors. I feel like there's an overemphasis on physical beauty when people judge the attractiveness of a woman, and not enough attention on smart, logical, confident, etc.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/10ftr4/rsonw_describes_how_men_view_their_own/c6d3r74) I feel like if you presented most of these Redditors with a not-so-goodlooking woman, but she was funny, smart, and maybe even had some money, they would not go for it. Just a hunch.
* [""I would say this post is more applicable to the difference between a hot woman's experience, and an average man and woman's experience.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/10ftr4/rsonw_describes_how_men_view_their_own/c6d4g47) Bingo!
* [""The prince charming/cowboy/bad boy/immortal vampire/male stripper/whatever is just as unattainable and depressing for the average guy as is the supermodel/insatiable sex addict/cute quirky girl is.
I think the difference is that men are taught to attain happiness through their achievements, while women have historically gained their sense of self worth through the kind of family they can build. So when men are insecure, they go out and do something awesome. When women feel insecure, they hop on the elliptical and buy a new pair of shoes.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/10ftr4/rsonw_describes_how_men_view_their_own/c6d4uti) Wrong. When men are insecure, they get on reddit and bitch about how the media has oppressed them. Hence, thread.
* [""I sometimes wish I was better looking, but women really don't care about muscles and abs as much as we care about boobs and asses.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/10ftr4/rsonw_describes_how_men_view_their_own/c6d4gxr) And here's my final argument, which is:

Bullshit. ANY OTHER THREAD on Reddit will talk about how girls are just downright bitches and sluts for hooking up with that beef-caked douchebag from college. How DARE SHE look over my superior intellect and wit (which is definitely a 10/10 wouldbang), for this cocknut who cares about his outward appearance and strength more than he does about le reason and logic! He is obviously just using her for her body and appreciates nothing else about her! We, as a superior race raised by Sagan Himself, should not focus on personal acheivements or fitness, for our brainpower is something to behold, and to be called attractive.

&gt;Any professional sports player. Here in Australia the media glorifies our football players like they are the greatest thing since sliced bread. They are essentially brutes that have little to no world skills other than being able to play footy well. Most become tradies (construction workers, plumbers, electricians etc) after their footy career and live a paycheck to paycheck lifestyle. Insanely overrated.

And the media, *fuck them* they've gone and glorified something, that media brainwashes everybody except us hey? And they're obviously ""brutes"" because that football player who dated that hot girl who never noticed me was a *jerk* and it's not like, you know, they're just normal people who happen to be talented footballers (the game here, in case wondering is Australian Rules Football, I'm Australian) Then after that do they go get a STEM degree? No they work in a trade, as an *electrician* pfft what a useless job for unskilled people.

Man it's been a while since I've posted here so please forgive me if I am rusty (be gent[le], etc. etc.) and please don't crucify me for going for some low hanging fruit.

The putrid ground fruit I am picking up is [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/16jtpa/what_is_the_most_beautiful_song_youve_ever_heard/) asscredit thread about the most beautiful song you have ever heard. Now I'm a sucker for music, and I love music discussion, which is part of the reason I am subbed to /r/askreddit because seeing the same 3 music questions over and over again gets me off while I groove to some Meshuggah (also for lulz... ok mostly for lulz).

Starting off with a game: The top comment will be

a. Queen/Beatles/Pink Floyd

b. A Joke

c. Someone posting about how reddit's taste in music is soooo great and underground compared to the garbage everyone else listens to!

If you answered **b** you are correct:

&gt;Slob on my Knob - Three 6 Mafia

As if that wasn't enough, the whole thread is a lyric thread except for someone who posted [this](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WRYWotuf3cg) and is currently at -1. I have no idea what that is.

Next top level comment is an Explosions in the Sky song. Now I don't know if this is considered a reddit-jerk but the hivemind seems to like Explosions in the Sky a lot. Who can blame them? That's a pretty sweet band. Their love is a bit weird though, seeing how reddit HATES hipsters but Explosions is basically the prototypical hipster post-rock band (if I'm not mistaken). The biggest reply thread is just some jerking about how much reddit loves Explosions and how great they are but another one wants to tell you about this sweet new underground band he just heard about that is SO DEEP:

&gt;If you like them, try post-rock titans Godspeed You! Black Emperor. GY!BE's album ""Lift Your Skinny Fists like Antennas to the Heavens."" is incredible. Listen to the song Storm first. It moved me completely the first time I heard it.

My problem with this is two-fold: First, I'm pretty sure there is at least a 90% overlap in fans of GY!BE and EitS, and, second, this sounds like he ripped it straight from a Pitchfork review.

Farther down we have someone risking his/her life/neckbeard to tell everyone about:

&gt;Jeff Buckley - Hallelujah

I don't know about you guys but I have never ever heard of that song. I'm glad someone posted it! DAE onions?

My favorite comment, however, is the next one (I can't post it because I suck at formatting) but it's one you see in every music thread, The ""Let me Compile Some Good Songs on this Thread to Get Le Max Karma"" comment which includes such gems as the Buckley song, Johnny Cash, Pink Floyd, Leonard Cohen, Bach (I'm convinced no one on reddit actually listens to classical music and they just say it to sound intelligent), and reddit's favorite RADIOHEAD.

The next comment down is basically the same exact list with some additions no one has ever heard of like Arcade Fire and Velvet Underground.

What's interesting to me about this thread is the lack of my favorite karma whoring trick: Le G[ent]leman Link Poster. In almost every music thread there is a commenter who comments to almost every song post with

&gt;link for the lazy

all while racking up insane amounts of karma and ""THANK YOU GOOD SIR I NEVER WOULD HAVE FOUND IT OTHERWISE""

I guess what I'm going for here is reddit's strange music culture. On the one hand, everyone wants those sweet karma points (joke threads, etc.) but on the other hand, a lot of redditors also wanted their music tastes validated. They know if they post an actual [unknown band](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQToSTTUBAI) no one will bother to listen to it an upvote it so they pick the next best thing: a band that doesn't get much top 40 play but is still adored by tons of people. In their minds this evens everything out because they will get upvotes and nice comments to pretend that they helped a lot of people discover something new! At the same time, looking through the comments it's clear that almost every song posted is a love song. This is another trick that is widely used, and I could go on a rant about how redditor's don't get music and only see as far as the title but I've done enough generalization and being a dick for today.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_16kfsj,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/16kfsj/askreddit_wants_to_know_the_most_beautiful_songs/,

Or ""friendzoning"".",gfour,203,55,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/ysg9w/reddits_objectification_of_women_or_friendzoning/,"Today I bring you this [lovely askreddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yr4hl/i_just_took_a_girl_out_to_dinner_paid_for_the/). For a while now, the internet has been going on about something called friendzoning. What friendzoning is is when a women has the audacity to be friendly with someone of the opposite sex, but not fuck them. Jealous teeenagers and idiot neckbeard virgins love the term because it gives them an excuse. They would be boning every night, if not for the fact that women apparently only like ""douchebags"" (aka people who aren't them).
The term is very off-putting to me because it not only treats women as sex machines, but it assigns a negative connotation to friendship. It seems incredibly odd that people actually complain about being friends with someone. If I were a woman, I would be incredibly insulted by a friend describing me as ""friendzoning them"".

This particular askreddit thread never explicitly uses the phrase ""friendzone"", but it is definitely implied. The actual question is just a rephrased version of ""Reddit, when have you tried to have sex just to be friendzoned?"". Now that I read into it, the actual question is even more insulting. ""What have you done for a potential partner that has been a complete waste of time?"" implies that taking someone out is a complete waste of time unless it ends in secks. 

This particular comment
&gt;Yeah, she wasn't worth the time anyhow. If she's willing to do that behind her BF's back and falsely lead you on, she's a terrible person.

really bothers me. Let's analyze it, shall we?
&gt;Yeah she wasn't worth the time anyway

Because women aren't worth anything if they don't have sex with you.
&gt;If she's willing to do that behind her BF' back

Implying that she didn't make the boyfriend up to avoid someone who would post this creepy thread.
&gt; Falsely lead you on 

Since when is taking someone out (a nice gesture, even if it is only to eventually bone them) equivalent to *them* leading you on? OP probably asked this woman if she wanted to have dinner, and she accepted. How is that leading him on? If you are gay, are your friends ""leading you on"" if you hang out but don't fuck? If she said something that implied she had feelings for him solely to get a free dinner, that might be considered leading him on. But from the post it seems like she was only accepting a friendly invitation. 
&gt;She's a terrible person

WTF??? Women are terrible people if they are friendly with members of the opposite sex but don't date them? This is a very strong statement to make about someone if you know nothing about them. For a place so keen on slut-shaming and rape victim blaming, reddit sure hates women who don't have a lot of sex (with them at least) too.

Here we have another lovely anecedote
&gt;Fun story: I also went on a 'date' with a girl but she made the mistake of telling me that she had a boyfriend DURING dinner. She had ordered an appetizer, entree, couple of fancy drinks and dessert while I had just gotten a pint and a plate of pasta. When it came time to pay, I asked for 2 bills and what to be on what bill. She looked at me like I was retarded and said 'Why did you do that?' I said 'What? Why would I pay a bill for just a friend?' Suffice to say, we never spoke again.
Before this, she had always made me believe she was single. Telling me she had a boyfriend was a 'confession' of sorts but she 'really liked me'. Fuck off, bitch.

This comment pissed me off for two reasons. One: it makes it seem like the only reason you should be friends with a women is if you think sex will come out of it, and two, ""fuck off bitch"". Seriously? A woman having a boyfriend who isn't you is grounds for calling them a bitch and telling them to fuck off?

My point is, reddit has a tenancy to treat women as nothing but sex objects. Put kindness/money/food in, get sex out. The way it sounds like some of them treat women, they don't even deserve to be ""friendzoned"".

Well, except for the gifted redditors of r/talesfromretail.",TheHarpyEagle,172,28,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1hauik/the_teen_generation_is_doomed_to_stupidity_well/,"I was linked to [this thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7ora/she_gave_me_fake_currency/) from /r/thatHappened. I always like to look at the comments for these stories to see how people respond to them and found a little anti-teen circlejerk that quickly transforms into an anti-public school jerk. Bear with me, this thread is all over the place.

The story told the tale of a teen who received a $0.50 coin as change for her transaction, and this ignorant little teen starts screaming that it's fake money.

Sitting at the top of the replies is this.

&gt; [Yeah, there's an entire generation walking around right now that has no clue that money hasn't always looked exactly the same. =/](http://np.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7ora/she_gave_me_fake_currency/carn19x) (+80)

Alright, so one dubiously existent teen is a good marker for an entire age group. Let's see how else teens and children today are doomed.

&gt; [i remember learning about half dollar and dollar coins in elementary school. i wonder if they quit teaching about them](http://np.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7ora/she_gave_me_fake_currency/carn50i) (+45)
&gt;&gt; [Yeah, they have. They just teach basic bills and coins. And even that is barely touched on.](http://np.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7ora/she_gave_me_fake_currency/carn60s)(+31)

Burried further down in the the thread, a person who identifies themselves as a schoolteacher says that they do indeed teach children about half and whole dollar coins. Of course, as a user is quick to point out, this can by no means be the norm.

&gt;[no they haven't. This school year i helped 2nd graders learn how to count money, and we had half dollar and dollar coin questions for the kids to answer/worksheets.](http://np.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7ora/she_gave_me_fake_currency/carrfns) (+3)

&gt;&gt; [You must've been in a really good school district.](http://np.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7ora/she_gave_me_fake_currency/carwlrt) (+1)

Of course no one really pays attention to that kind of reasoning and this comment thread ends shortly after, so we must return to the first comment chain to see more of the jerks in action.

&gt;[It really is. My 12-year-old stepsister is finishing 6th grade right now and still can barely read without doing it out loud. And even then she trips over words. And don''t get me started on the math...](http://np.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7ora/she_gave_me_fake_currency/carnd6r) (+19)

Another users feels the blame lies at least partially elsewhere.

&gt;[You can't just blame the schools for that. Surely her parents should be taking some initiative in helping her read, no?](http://np.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7ora/she_gave_me_fake_currency/carpzwl) (+49)

Which gains the completely unrelated reply

&gt; [My parents helped me start reading around 5 and I am still shocked years later how people can't read very well.](http://np.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7ora/she_gave_me_fake_currency/carsad7) (+32)

Which in turn opens the floodgates for those gifted readers who talk about how they were so much smarter than their peers. Here is a small sampling from that batch.

&gt; [In my year 12 class (class of 10; it's a small school), 70% of the class couldn't read fluently. I think people got offended when I asked why they didn't learn to read... I dunno, back in primary school with everyone else? (or apparently not with everyone else, because this seems to be normal...)](http://np.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7ora/she_gave_me_fake_currency/carvsw0) (+21)

Man, education sucks so much nowadays. I wonder how these redditors got so smart with this crap. Oh, charter schools.

&gt; [Now I am in college and redditing inclass more often than not, and getting more work done than the public school kids. I think It funny.](http://np.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7ora/she_gave_me_fake_currency/cas7rp4) (+2)

Back on topic a little later down, the person with the illiterate stepsister says:

&gt; [Her dad was in jail for a while, and her biological mother is a fucking useless piece of shit. So... Yeah. Let me know how that works out.](http://np.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7ora/she_gave_me_fake_currency/carwm2d) (+7)

So the parents are not taking any part in the child's education, and the school has failed to somehow force them to do so or make up for their lack of parenting? How dare they.

And don't forget to get that anti-American jerk in where you can.

&gt; [And THIS is the issue with America's public school systems. Parents are not involved enough in their child's lives](http://np.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7ora/she_gave_me_fake_currency/carzrx6) (+6)

&gt; [And this is why I moved to the other side of the god damned globe. There are still dumb-as-shit people here, but at least the schools don't pull shit like this.](http://np.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7ora/she_gave_me_fake_currency/cas67a0) (+2)

A lot of you meta-lovers probably also subscribe to /r/subredditdrama, which seems to be falling apart as we speak. This post is not specifically about that, but uses it as an example to showcase a lot of user's sense of entitlement. The situation in short: /u/syncretic was already a controversial mod over there, but yesterday he put up [this announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z7tzn/announcement_the_following_users_have_been_banned/), stating 13 users were banned from the subreddit for posting in linked threads. The top comment seems at first to be a concern about accidentally posting in a thread that is also linked to in subredditdrama. The most upvoted response to that is that it is just not ok to post in threads subredditdrama linked you too. I'll quote the response to that here for your convenience: 

&gt;[Okay. So they did. So? Simply seeing that SRD has linked it means it's now off limits to me? Fuck that. If there is an interesting conversation going that I want to participate it, then I will. And to ban someone for that? Holy shit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z7tzn/announcement_the_following_users_have_been_banned/c62980d) 

This is the mentality I'd like to focus on: “Fuck your rules, I just want to enjoy myself!”, which comes with basically every modpost that limits the freedom of users even a tiny bit. There is usually still discussion about this, and luckily some people make good counterpoints in the thread. 

The fuck-you-i-like-this-mentality is all over reddit. Weed should be legal because I enjoy it. Pirating is fine because I benefit from it. Kids should not be in r/aww because I don't think they're cute. Reposting something every day is ok because I haven't seen it. Taking creepshots is fine because I like looking at them. TIL something I already knew, but like to be reminded of. Feel free to mentally add your own, because I could go on forever.

This mentality can never be good for reddit as a whole, or for individual subreddits. Imagine if every user of subredditdrama went into every thread and started talking there. First of all they would make subredditdrama worse (especially when the drama happens in small subs) because it would be harder to see the drama that was linked. The subreddit is already notorious for going into threads and voting en masse, making it harder for people who come after them to find the drama. Secondly, some poor specific sub might suddenly have a thread full of idiots that don't know what they're talking about. Just [look what happened](http://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthisbug/comments/yewkx/nh_this_spider_killed_a_snake_in_my_basement_what/) when a user in WTF was advised to post in /r/whatsthisbug. That subreddit is meant for identifying bugs and sharing some information on them. Eventually the top reply came from someone who actually answered the question (it took him some time to rise to the top over all the useless speculation and lame jokes), and could have lead to some more discussion about what the spider was doing to the snake, or about if he made the correct identification, but that won't happen because 'lol relevant username', which gets highly upvoted, because fuck you I think it's funny!

I'll stop here because I don't want to get preachy and boring. We are all here on reddit for our own entertainment, sure. But the attitude of 'I enjoy it so it's fine to do, and other people should just put up with it' doesn't do this site any good. This website is not about you as a person (excluding some specific subs), it's about sharing stuff that is supposed to be interesting to OTHER PEOPLE. 

The main point is: Yes this is the internet, don't take it too seriously, but stop fucking everything up for everyone else, because there will be nothing left to fuck up after a while. Maybe think about if you want other people to all behave the same as you do for a second.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_za5pq,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/za5pq/a_long_angry_post_about_the_attitude_of_whatever/,

Taylor Swift is holding a contest wherein schools try to get the most votes, with the grand prize of having her perform at their school. In addition, the top 5 schools get $10,000 towards musical education. Sounds innocent enough right? 

I forgot to mention that Taylor Swift is a celebrity, and therefore deserves the wrath of the Internet's most elite hackers (read: neckbeards who know how to use the refresh button) for having the audacity to make an online contest. 

4chan, the idolized big brother of reddit, is already on the case and has successfully put the ""Horace Mann School for the Deaf"" in the running. Of course it doesn't take long to reach reddit, at which point people [commending 4chan for their trolling abilities](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/z2egs/god_damnit_4chan_you_are_amazing/c60uvc9) and want to take part in the fun themselves. 

[Unfortunately, that requires LIKING Taylor Swift on Facebook (the horror)!](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/z2egs/god_damnit_4chan_you_are_amazing/c60vome0) And we know how much redditors loath Facebook. Plus they don't want to seem ""uncool"" to their friends.This diverges into a whole other jerk about having [a fake Facebook account](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/z2egs/god_damnit_4chan_you_are_amazing/c60wz9k) because not having a Facebook is the new not having a TV.  

Anyway, the 4chan and Facebook jerks are fun, but what really annoyed me was the fact that none of these people who think that this is such ""great trolling"" care at all about the deaf kids. They are just pawns in their pathetic attempt to troll a celebrity. Plus, the people in this thread have an ignorant view that every deaf kid is 100% deaf and unable to appreciate music, [which isn't the case](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/z2egs/god_damnit_4chan_you_are_amazing/c60wmxk). 

[At one point I thought I saw someone who was actually being rational. No wait, he was just setting up a hilarious deaf joke.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/z2egs/god_damnit_4chan_you_are_amazing/c60w5gw)

Like many other online votes that reddit claims to have ""trolled"", the end result will be either the contest makers taking it off or changing it because of the abuse, or it will just be great publicity for the celebrity/company, which was their goal all along. 

What annoys me about this is that it insulting to deaf people. 4chan and reddit only wanted to do this because of the [""hilarious""](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/z2egs/god_damnit_4chan_you_are_amazing/c60usoq) result of Taylor Swift going to a school to sing for people who they assume can't hear her music. All they care about is being part of a group and getting ""lulz"" and any attempts to say that they were doing it partly for the kids at that school is bullshit. 

I'm sure the kids at the school would love to know that the reason Taylor Swift is coming to their school is because of an elaborate prank.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_z2w17,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/z2w17/reddit_once_again_displays_their_closemindedness/,

/r/funny and /r/adviceanimals, we know, are ultra-poo when it comes to humour, but sometimes a post comes through when I'm scrolling /r/all (dae subscribe to too many obscure and slow subreddits and get bored) that raises a sniff of the nose, perhaps a titter. 

But here we have a le new epic meme XD to contend with, beginning as some kind of 'workplace' banter I suppose. When 'America' is asleep, 'Australia' isn't, so they do the 'night shift'. That's the basic concept behind the whole thing. Not very funny really.

[So anyway here's one about how it's like a job to submit this brilliant content to Reddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1cxlaa/america_this_is_australia_speaking_you_have_been/)

[Here's one about how it's Australia's turn to recycle le maymays!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1cxkxx/australia_here_here_is_your_nightly_upload_ready/)

You get the gist.

[In fact it becomes a dialogue.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1cy53y/australia_here_is_our_thoughts_on_thursday/)

Diplomacy in action via reddit, isn't technology wonderful?

[Here's one with the British flag and it's about people living in Britain while people also live in US and Australia etc](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1cxq5b/there_are_other_time_zones_as_well_you_know/)

[Ooh and another ... many lols are had](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1cym0i/as_a_british_person_seeing_all_these/)

This all manifests in a feeling of camaraderie between the two nations. It's a fitting occasion, then, to bring out again [everyone's favourite image macro with text on](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1cy8hh/americas_feeling_towards_australia_recently/)

[You can probably tell what this inspired submission 'fixed'](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1d01cb/australia_and_america_the_last_two_days_fixed/). Yes, Australia are upside down, depending on whether you think North is up!

This leads to le epic new meme: [Ameristralia!!!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1d01tg/googled_ameristralia_was_not_disappointed/) And yes, even the scholars at the urban dictionary saw fit to include a new definition! We did it Reddit!

This calls for a celebration! A new subreddit perhaps! /r/Ameristralia! Huzzaahhhhhh

Now don't get me wrong, there have been some brilliant offshoots directly from content on the default subreddits (/r/wheredidthesodago is one, arguably /r/mildlyinteresting another) but really? I really can't see this meme having legs enough to warrant a subreddit (unless you count geography the most hilarious topic in the world).

[We will rule Reddit day and night](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1cyuao/team_ameristralia_with_our_powers_combined/) ... ""Please don't"" is my quiet reply.


Of course everyone has forgotten other countries, like New Zealand and Canada, so now they are another le epic country, New Zanada / Canland Newada or whatever. But I don't care really.

Where is the humour in this? I literally do not know what we are laughing at here. Maybe I just don't get it. In fact I definitely do not. But considering the frothy excitement of many Redditors over this I'm puzzled ... is it part of the super secret club mentality? A sort of tribalistic ""yeah, you're in our group!"" mindset? Maybe someone can explain it to me.

The general summary, if you dont' feel like reading the thread yourself, is that this high school boy was accuse (wrongly) of planning to bring a gun to school and kill a classmate. A number of classmates testified against them, but it would seem there were two girls who were the main accusers. There a number of typically reddit jerks in here but the most prevalent is 'girls can get away with anything'. Let's find some examples!

First we have a number of examples asking why the girls weren't charged with anything
&gt;Wow, that is bullshit. I personally feel they deserve criminal charges for making that shit up.

&gt;No kidding. Perjury, at the very least.

&gt;Got to be contempt of court

&gt;Why were they not charged with perjury?

&gt;Agreed. Can't you sue them for slander? Not for the money, but for revenge of course.

Ignoring the fact that losing a civil court case doesn't immediately make you a criminal, reddit instead offers it's own explanations.

&gt;Framing someone for attempted murder can get you in a lot of trouble. If they were twenty two year old males in Texas they would probably be looking at hard time.

Yup, males are oppressed, females run around accusing people of rape and nothing ever happens to them.

&gt;Not when you're a teenage girl. They probably got cookies too, if they were attractive.

Even worse than being a teenage girl, you can be an attractive girl. They make the most false ~~rape~~ attempted murder accusations.

&gt;According to SRS, women never lie or falsely accuse men of anything. Men are always guilty, just ask SRS!

A little bit of anti-SRS jerk mixed in with the women can accuse men of anything and get away with it.

&gt;So long as your female. Try being a guy and accusing a girl of anything. Doesn't work nearly as well.

Not really much more to say, just pulling more example of commenters siding with the jerk. You can find a billion more comments going along with this jerk, and it pretty clearly overlaps with some others. It's not too different from the 'all men are pedophiles' jerk, where any male interacting with any child can immediately be accused of being a pedophile and have his life permanently ruined by those damn women. In every single form of this 'men can be accused of anything' jerk, it's always a female accusing them, which is important to notice. Not to be too SRS-lite, but this is a pretty good display of reddits resentment of women. Here's someone who really does hate high-school girls.

&gt;Are you serious when you say you don't know any girls that cruel? High school girls are literally the worst human beings on the planet. In a city not far from me just the other year a group of high school girls locked a boy with downs syndrome (or FASD, I can't remember) in a shed then set it on fire.
High school girls can literally be worse than Hitler. Too many of them are brought up with no empathy, no repercussions for their actions, and no human decency. They might not be the ones to shoot up a school, but they are definitely the ones who drive a kid to do it.

You heard it here first folks, high shcool girls, literally hitler. How is this not even a circlejerk post? I'd be surprised this post would get upvotes, given it literally is just spewing hate at high school girls, but then I remembered that this for pretty much every group they dont' like. Replace women with 'black people' and high school girls with 'nigger', and it's pretty much the same thing. As in, I don't hate women, I just hate high school girls.

However, hatred of women is not the only jerk we see prevalent in this thread. It did take in place in America, so there's got to be something said about that...

&gt;I'm from Holland, so I don't really understand the American law system that much. My question is: Why did it take such a long time for this problem to be solved while the jury only took an hour to come up with a verdict?

As a le superior European, why is your American Court system so bad? To be fair, this is an honest complaint, why did the case take 3 whole years? But at the same time, it fits right into reddit's Europe = Good, America = Bad circlejerk. Surprisingly, the responses upvoted for this are actually reasonable, and the downvoted ones were the typical circlejerk.

**EDIT:** *Upon re-reading this, I'd say I misconstrued their response. This part isn't particularly jerky. When I read it the first time (poor reading comprehension and all) I read the 'I'm from Holland' not as a reason for a lack of understanding of American law, but as an unrelated 'Here in holland that wouldn't happen'.*

A couple downvoted jerky comments:
&gt;Basically in America, you are guilty unless you can prove you are innocent,and if you cannot afford to prove you are innocent, you are fucked.

Yup. Leave it to reddit to generalize actual issues, and say $$$ = freedom in America.

&gt;Quite simply, America hates men. Were this an accused woman, everything would have been handled unofficially in a few days.

Given the rest of the thread, it's sort of surprising that this would net downvotes, but I guess faith in humanity = restored.

Anwyays, that's about all I'm going to pull out of the thread. There are countless other posts that jerk around, but a lot of them are just redundant. There's a bit of reddit's revenge-fetish in there, as in ""Someone should slap those bitches"", and that's probably a jerk of it's own, or mixed in with the others. Remember, your female overlords are free to accuse you of rape, murder, and pedophelia at any point in time, so make sure not to be alone with them, be alone with children, or interact with other people, or those bitches might just ruin your life with one false accusation.

Our ""internet freedom"" redditors are simply fighting the man because they view the takedown of a website to be ""censorship"" and ""orwellian infringement on our rights."" instead of how it's information on how to build a weapon.

Here they are for the lazy:

1. Go fuck yourself. This is a crucial step, and will be recommended should you decide to openly voice your concerns about /r/atheism[3] . Might as well get this out of the way so when it is recommended, you can proudly claim 'I've done that already' and the discussion can continue. A broken bottle is ideal, but whatever tool you have available it fine, even if it is a portal gun.

2. Repeat step 1 to ensure completion.

3. Unsubscribe. You don't HAVE to be here, you don't HAVE to read the memes, sagan quotes, and dumbasses on facebook. Red button on the right. Go away, we don't want you.

4. Repeat step 1 again.

5. Understand our user base. If you live in the UK, you might legitimately not understand a LARGE portion of our users. Google the Bible belt. I will wait..... Ok, that's long enough. There are many atheist teens in the Bible belt, whom stay in the proverbial closet to prevent bad shit from happening to them. This includes something as trivial as being cut off from college (which in the US is not a right, but a paid privilege), to something as sever as being thrown in the streets or (in the rare case) murdered. There have been users on here asking for help due to parents wanting to involuntarily commit them to a psyche ward for their atheism. This subreddit is for them to vent.

6. Repeat step 1

7. We have every reason to hate religion. While we don't necessarily hate religious people, we do find their beliefs silly and worth mocking. However, religion is responsible for many deaths in Iran, Sudan, and the Bible Belt, especially among this particular faith known as Christian Science, which believes prayer is a legitimate alternative to MEDICINE and SURGERY, which sometimes ends up killing the unfortunate kid.

8. Repeat step one, one last time.

9. If you are still here and have concerns, discuss. If not, unsubscribe button is on the right, have a nice day and don't forget to go fuck yourself.

10. Go fuck yourself.

So there you have it. If you disagree with them, you should not look at r/atheism. You should not critique them. You should not call out their bullshit. You should not downvote them. You should not question r/atheism.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_1acp6u,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1acp6u/lef_dear_ratheism_bashers/,

But that's old news.

This comes out of a very unlikely source, /r/gamegrumps.

For those who don't know, Game Grumps is a Youtube channel where two moderately-big internet people, egoraptor and JonTron, come together and play games. Quite often they're shitty, leading to the duo becoming grumpy, as it were. I happen to enjoy the show, and I'm sure there are a few others here who do too.

But... [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/15x5md/gam_gamps_featured_on_kotaku/). This post links directly to a Kotaku (part of the Gawker's network, also known as the Third Reich), about a story featuring an animation that uses a ""famous"" Game Grumps moment. It's just a nice little way to let the guys behind the channel (who have, in the past, participated in that community) know that they have something new up on Kotaku, which is kind of a big deal. They're a gaming channel, they got featured on one of the big gaming websites. Big deal for most people.

But oh boy, did OP step in it. See, he linked *directly* to Kotaku. Meaning every view gives them... *pageviews*! The horror! We are literally contributing to the Holocaust right now!

The first one even uses the phrase ""I have a vendetta against you now"".

An interesting thread to leaf through to see the progression of this). /r/games new queue is also a known Kotaku graveyard from time to time.

DAE Steam?",,173,35,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/12qvrp/dice_and_ea_is_releasing_battlefield_1942_for/,"So. Here is the situation - DICE (the creators of Battlefield franchise), celebrating the 10 years since the original Battlefield release, 1942, has released it to download and play online for free, forever. It is one of the critically most acclaimed games in gaming history, shaping the future of online FPS in the last decade. DICE were really generous with this offer, because it allows not only to play the game, but also to install hundreds of mods, including Desert Combat, Forgotten Hope, Eve of Destruction and many others. Even their beloved god Gaben hasn't released Counter Strike for free yet.

However, one *but* - this game is available on Origin. It basically is the EA-made competitor for the Steam platform. Although our opinions and experiences might differ (I'm yet to encounter a problem with Origin, it's availability, performance, privacy or support), it is criticised for being slow (*because Steam is as lightweight as a hair from Gaben's glorious beard*), having a weird EULA(*because EA is literally illuminati hitlers and Steam doesn't collect information of my computer hardware and other stuff despite [the recent changes in EULA](http://store.steampowered.com/eula/eula_39190)*) and other stuff. But basically because EA is literally Hitler and Mitt Romney has shown support for EA with an advert on 9gag and Gawker.

[This is the post I'm reviewing - ""Good Guy Dice""](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12om3a/good_guy_dice/). Looks promising, because the title suggests it to be a variation of the over-used *Good Guy Greg advice macro*. It didn't disappoint - in true /r/gaming tradition the post is a link to an imgur meme picture with DICE logo and text in Impact font praising DICE for this move; rather than a link to Origin store for download or the announcement post in Battlefield blog. Proves how low-effort even memes have become to be.

Among the 140 comments as of 18:37 GMT, most of them were either thanking the OP for providing link in the comments (yay free karma!), sharing their happy memories of playing BF1942, or, as you would expect, bashing EA, DICE and everyone else for providing this game on... Origin. Because only Valve is allowed to have their own game repository. 

Bravest comments in a random order:

&gt;[FUCK EA FUCK ORIGIN](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12om3a/good_guy_dice/c6wx4ct)

Thankfully, this got downvoted (+5/-23), as well as his next comment in the same thread about how DICE would have been better if it had breaken the relations with its owner EA. Because, clearly, all DICE personnel was kidnapped by EA and held at gunpoint while making Battlefield games; rather than being a part of EA by their own choice. Thanks for advice, armchair businessman n1nj4_v5_p1r4t3.

&gt;[Scumbag DICE: gives out game, only in origin](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12om3a/good_guy_dice/c6x54q0)

&gt;[well to be fair they just want you to download origin](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12om3a/good_guy_dice/c6ww8hs)

While it is sort of true, how dare they release free games? The fact that this comment is (+48/-17) means that either 47 people think that this comment is worthy of being near the top because it adds a lot to the discussion, or it is another evidence that EA is Evil Alliance.

A reply in the thread is

&gt;Origin doesn't benefit anyone but EA

Thankfully, (+2/-6). But still, there are people who think that having a choice between different gaming distributors benefits only EA, and not the consumer.

Another reply to the same thread, stating how he would refuse having 1 000 000 USD just for installing a game distribution platform on his computer:

&gt;[Free on PC, but not Xbox 360? That sucks. I disagree with the title.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12om3a/good_guy_dice/c6x215l)

Yes, Dice are scumbags for releasing a PC-only title only on PC and not on the console on which the game has never been released before (and no other Refractor Engine game has ever been on console), and the XBOX360 even hadn't been out when the game first released.
When being poked fun at with an ironic ""PC MASTER RACE"" image, he replies with:

&gt;Screw that, I would rather have my 200 dollar Xbox that will last me a whole generation than an 800 dollar PC that I would end up needing to update.
Edit: I have an opinion, fuck me right?

I'm not even going to analyze this comment.

The headline is ""Got stuck behind this SUV at the lake. Further affirmed my decision to be childfree.""

Why? How did this affirm their decision? Usually in /r/Childfree there is some perceived reason to bitch (parents can't afford kids, bratty kids, ugly kids, bad parenting, etc). I can't find it in this one. Is there obvious damage to the car? No, just a bit dirty I guess? Their sticker is not expired. I can't see anything here.

They seem to be happy about their kids, since they're advertising their abundance. And they're on a trip to a lake! Sounds fun, I guess. The moral of the story is: Kids exist, so I don't want any.

I went to the comments to see what I was missing, but they're all about icky kids, and ""choose condoms.""

First time long time.  I would like to bring attention to [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ftwdx/what_were_you_surprised_to_learn_was_a_thing/) AskReddit post.

Disregarding the most upvoted comment for a second, we can see that many of the ""things"" are rather extraordinary:  milk in a bad, grilled cheese and tomato soup or pie.

Let's bring our attention back up to the most upvoted comment, currently at 1820 upvotes.  

&gt; I'm Finnish and until I started going on the internet I didn't realize religion was a thing... I just thought it was something that only weird people did

This is backed up by another highly upvoted comment currently at 982.

&gt; Yes. For the longest time, I assumed that no-one really believed in religion. Of course, I knew of 'religious people', but obviously (so I thought) no one could really believe in this stuff. So I assumed that they just 'went through the motions' for tradition's sake, or treated religion as a sort of Live Action Role Play, or a strange myth-fandom: some kids were into elves and orcs, some into vampires and werewolves, some into star wars and some into the god thing. It was a shock when - well into adulthood - I figured out that, no, they really, really, really do believe it, as if it were really, really, really real.

The rest of comments pretty much fall in line with these two.  There are a few things that irk me about these two comments.  First of all, how can someone, anyone, not know that ""regular"" everyday people are religious.  Is it to out of the ordinary to have faith in a higher power?  I try not to feel personally offended by this as my family is religious and not ""weird"" and I am religious as well.  

The second comment is equally as baffling.  I don't know if these comments are placating to Reddit's Nordic centrism or maybe these commentors are lying, but there is simply know way I can imagine someone growing up and not realizing that actual religious people exist.  The second commentor also uses the phrase ""god thing"" and in two words reduces the immensely complicated concept of religion and belief in god into a passing hobby, you know, like stamp collecting.  It also puts all religion on the same plane as Dungeons and Dragons, which is fun don't get me wrong, but is pretty incomparable to religion.

I think this all goes into Reddit's belief that moderate, intelligent and kind religious people do not exist.  They are all fundies, all violent and certainly below the proud and logical race of blonde Nordic supermen.  It sometimes crosses my mind moderation does not exist on Reddit at all.

Thank you

1360016916.0,138,self.circlebroke,17w61x,Home Owners Associations are literally King George III. ,familyorfriends,183,45,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/17w61x/home_owners_associations_are_literally_king/,"For the communists and socialists out there Home Owners Associations, or HOA’s, are groups of people elected by neighborhood vote to enforce contractual agreements between all homeowners to take certain actions and refrain from others. These contracts are built into the deed and are binding on all future buyers, tenants, etc. if [certain requirements are met]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_\(law\)#Requirements_for_burden_to_run_at_common_law) 

Now I was a bit reluctant to make an effort post about this. In a vacuum, there isn’t exactly anything wrong with complaints about HOA’s. They are often home to busybodies who demand strict application of the rules while ignoring the spirit behind them. They can occasionally be used to settle personal grudges. The rules can be inconsistently applied. Their history is [problematic to say the least]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_v._Kraemer). I also have worked as a legal clerk for a law firm that represents homeowners dealing with HOA’s, and have been offered a full time position after I finish schooland pass the bar. I personally know that HOAs can be a pain in the ass. 

But reddit does not exist in a vacuum. This website is full of rugged brogressive individualists whose awareness of the effects of their actions ends at the tip of their nose. Telling a redditor that he has to mow his lawn every week for the sake of the community is comparable to living under a murderous, totalitarian regime.  

Given that some of these redditor’s complaints may actually be legitimate complaints I am not going to focus on those, but the responses to the stories. That said, it’s very easy to give a completely inaccurate portrayal of a situation without telling a single lie based on a selective telling of the facts. I know because I’ve been paid to do that. 

First we start off with my favorite, where voluntary agreements are [literally…fuck it:](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17v1fx/what_are_your_homeowners_association_hoa_horror/c894uqd)

&gt;WTF why would anyone let this become a thing you dont live in nazi germany how can these people have any kind of power.

[Being in a logical STEM profession clearly precludes you from being an asshole on an HOA Board.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17v1fx/what_are_your_homeowners_association_hoa_horror/c898fmi) For formatting reasons and laziness I omitted the equations:

&gt; Man, you could've tossed in a proof that you own both zero and one cats because 0=1. Most anyone that becomes a HOA board member has hit an intelligence ceiling preventing them from falsifying a mathematical proof.

[HOAs clearly violate Human Rights. Thank god I live in Europe.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17v1fx/what_are_your_homeowners_association_hoa_horror/c895k70)

&gt; Wow. I don't think i would buy anywhere with such crazy rules.

&gt;The European court of human rights would have a field day if anyone tried what I read in the comments below (prepossessing a house for unpaid made-up fines etc) here.

[Again, HOA’s are just like this one totalitarian regime that you may have heard about](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17v1fx/what_are_your_homeowners_association_hoa_horror/c8956ro)

&gt; My mom lives in a small subdivision where everything is controlled by the HOA. I mean everything. They have christmas decoration inspectors and even a committee to approve landscaping. Elections are held and the whole place turns into a campaign battleground. There are posters and phone messages, as well as in person visits from candidates. Oh, and they have a committee to ensure the posters are placed correctly. It's like a suburban retirement community version of 1930's Berlin.

[HOA's are not bound by the constitution. They can force logical atheists to start practicing Christianity.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17v1fx/what_are_your_homeowners_association_hoa_horror/c898q6d)

&gt; Contracts trump the constitution - an HOA could mandate that everyone must openly practice Christianity, because everyone who moves in has willingly signed a contract to do so. Think about an NDA agreement, which also trumps your 1A rights. There are only a few types of illegal contracts (such as contracts for things which are already illegal, like murder).

[Voluntary contractual agreements are anti-freedom](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17v1fx/what_are_your_homeowners_association_hoa_horror/c895r3t)

&gt;By reading the comments it seems America is the Land of the Free unless you live HOA controlled housing where small minded petty fucktards can screw you over on the smallest things. And can ultimately foreclose your house if you don't play their game?
 
[I’m not sure if this guy is referencing Thomas Jefferson or Anchorman](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17v1fx/what_are_your_homeowners_association_hoa_horror/c898zfm)

&gt; America, the land of the free where everyone is obsessed with controlling everyone elses choices.

&gt;We will never truly be free until every king is strangled with the entrails of every last priest and every HoA president is beat into a pulp with the remains of both the priest and the king.

One reddit user’s grandmother lived in a gated community and passed away. Her community did not let him come in with a u-haul on a weekend.

&gt;Edit: For those who don't get it, it's called ""making a stink until you get your way"".

&gt;If you owned the property, it probably would, but since I assume the property was still in his grandmothers name, he wouldn't have much of an authority. Red tape everywhere.

I'll repeat this, because I'm predicting I will get this complaint. HOA's can be petty pains in the ass. Some of the stories in that thread undoubtedly happened nearly as described (though just as many probably did not). But an HOA is nowhere near living in North Korea, Nazi Germany, etc. It is a voluntary agreement that you can walk away from. But since the ubermench John Galt's of reddit hate having other people tell them what to do, especially on their property a lack of perspective and scale starts flying all over.

She seems to have a great sense of humor, and is clearly willing to do an impromptu photo with just about any fan that hassles her in any situation. To me this suggests that while she embraces her popularity it's not in any sort of shitty attention-whoring sort of way, she is just living in the moment, appreciating what life has handed to her and giving all of us, her nerdy throngs of fans, what we love. There aren't many women that could handle being the face of OAG on a day to day basis and still maintain that great attitude and charisma.

Raw Story is a semi-liberal site, so I cannot vouch for accuracy of the content, but anyways, it talks about Paul Ryan [republlican], in a negative way. 


Redditors react to the article... let's see the top comment!
&gt;I wish someone would just punch Ryan in his lying fucking mouth. Right on camera, right as he's telling another one of his lying lies. Knock that bitch right out.

Well, that's the top comment on the article, at (101|25). 

Only one person calls out the top comment, but does it in a name calling way:
&gt;You're a lunatic.

At -(8|32).

Then after that, people talk about reddit, and the anti-democratic/liberal mindset of it.

I see nothing wrong with this post (77|7)
&gt;And I'm still arguing with people on Reddit right now that are convinced that this is ""Obama's sequester"", despite the fact that the Republicans forced it through by threatening to not pass the debt ceiling.

But then in response... (75|14)
&gt;Chances are, you're arguing with Conservative political operatives and right wing ideologues who are desperate to shift the accountability for their disgrace/incompetence to this President.
They're still trying to whitewash Dubya's legacy since his Administration has proven to be the worst in modern history.

He's saying that their are conservative political operatives who browse reddit, to try and make Obama look bad.

Anyways, moving on.. People start discussing the fiscal cliff, one guy brings up a relatively liberal view of who started it, and tries to write it unbiased, which is respectable. Then in response a guy brings up how NPR has a great link that shows how both sides are far from clean in terms of blame. A guy then asks why don't people use PBS and NPR more?

In response (23|4)
&gt;Because the conservatives won't accept NPR. It reports the facts. It's obviously liberal and always asking for hand outs.

And then building off of that
&gt;Facts tend to have a liberal bias.

Then, we have more jerking at (29|2)
&gt;Elections have consequences. But only if it's Dems who lose.

and at (20|4)
&gt;Yes, but they're used to ignoring the will of the people in favor of their deeply flawed ideological beliefs and the plutocratic agenda they're paid to champion

Now, we have people who are big fans of ABC: (12|1)

An OAG-related post makes the front page from r/funny. Laina herself [makes the drastic mistake of commenting] (http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/12k1rf/just_doing_as_ive_been_told/c6vpvtd), much jerking ensues (quite literally, I think it's safe to presume).

Aside from the pathetic nature of the overall post; ""LAINA I WANT TO SEE NAKED PICTURES OF YOU PLEASE"", the comments are rather tragic. 

The general mindset seems to be ""Laina commented? I'd better reply to her so she'll see that I am interested in her and perhaps she'll have sex with me!!111!!"".

There are countless more such replies. Fortunately they lack upvotes on the whole, but it's the fact that this mentality is so popular that bothers me.

I'm a guy who likes pot, but man /r/trees is just embarrassing sometimes.

http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/18kw9q/driving_high_tested_by_cnn_found_to_be_safer_than/

A site did a very weak study that showed you have to smoke a lot of weed to get super impaired on driving, this doesn't really prove much but the article takes shots at those uppity moms against driving impaired and calls for Obama to legalize weed because of it, so we know how the Ents will react!

For reference despite what the article says once the daily smoker got high he started knocking shit right over. Keep in mind that the link doesn't mention that.

&gt;I wish Jamie and Adam from Mythbusters would test this out, for Science!

 Starts off strong with this reaching the top. DAE Mythbusters and Science?!

&gt;The problem with getting high and driving is that it effects everyone different and depends on how regularly you smoke (among other variables). Myself, I'm not comfortable driving high, not that I become wreckless but because I get paranoid and don't like the feeling. I have frients that are like ninja's behind the wheel. They're totally comfortable and it doesn't seem to effect them at all. The problem is that people compare being high to being drunk and the two are totally different. I've been tired behind the wheel and that's way more dangerous and more common IMO.

I've got friends who drive BETTER high so maybe the truth is in the middle.

&gt;That's the great thing about driving high is that if you're too high to drive you know it. If you're too drunk to drive on the other hand your stupid drunk brain tricks you into thinking your okay to drive.

Man guys pot sure makes us superior in every way to drinkers, right?


&gt;I still don't know how I feel about high driving. I've done my fair share of stupid things, and one of those things was drunk driving. It wasn't a long stretch of road. About 3 miles. I was having a hard time keeping it together. When I get off my midnight shift at work. I vape a tray, put on some XX and cruise down the 405. Theres a limit. I can't drive at anything above a 7. But I don't see a difference in my driving ability at anything under a 6. Some of us take the preemptive approach and prefer not to drive under the influence, but I believe that stance is too broad. Chemicals affect us all differently. I can't drive on a cup of coffee. I'm too wired. I know some people who feel the same way. But we are of the caliber who despise caffeine, and won't ingest it. So I'm sure there's a lot of you who can only drive while caffeinated. The other problem with the preemptive approach is the same problem that I think occurs with a lot of other things such as anti-smoking commercials, and abstinence only sex education. There's just to many confounding variables to adhere to one cookie cutter standard. We should really be a nation founded on observational, and when applicable experimental, studies. Unfortunately, we're a very preemptive nation. Social stigma and taboos drive our policies. If a nation wide observational study was conducted , and the results were conclusive to show high driving wasn't anymore dangerousthan regular driving will the nay sayers still claim a preemptive approach? What about if experimental double-blind studies were conducted with a nation wide sample test? Would those be conclusive enough to get us all to stop being pussies? Who knows?! at a [7]

A lot of words to say because some people are different laws are bad.

Then this awesome chain.

&gt;I figured. I feel more focused when I'm high and driving

&gt;I used be a pizza man, never went to work not high, never got in a crash

&gt;I knew this I love driving high! windows down nice cool wind and great music, nothing better!

&gt;This is one of the best things I've ever seen

In fairness there are people saying that this blog is stupidly pro-legalization to the point of misrepresenting anything they can find, and 'safer than you'd expect' doesn't mean 'safe', but man there are a lot of dudes eager to say how awesome driving high is and how we should all chillax man.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_18l5kq,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/18l5kq/in_which_rtrees_jerks_over_driving_high/,

[The post in question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16g6d7/iama_21_year_old_asian_girl_with_albinism_ama/) This is a post by an Asian girl with albinism. She included a few pictures to let people know what she looked like, as that's relevant to the AMA. 

So, a girl's posting on Reddit? You know what that means.

But then, THEN we hit it. The real heart of this AMA. The real burning question that everyone wants to ask and at least 34 people upvoted:

&gt;[DO A GW! Ive never seen an albino gw](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16g6d7/iama_21_year_old_asian_girl_with_albinism_ama/c7vqsom)

Oh wait. That burning feeling is actually my ulcers. I hate this place sometimes.

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE. ORDER NOW AND GET TWO AMAS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE. The OP actually [posted an AMA earlier](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16fjij/iama_21_year_old_asian_girl_with_albinism_ama/) that got removed. I don't know why that one got removed and the now front paged one didn't. Honestly, I don't think this is really AMA-worthy, but whatever.

Fortunately for us, the old AMA has the exact same ""ur hawt"" jerk going on:

&gt;[I have a lady clitoral erection right now 0_0 ... Do you have some other websites/social networks/instagram/etc where we can follow you to see more pics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16fjij/iama_21_year_old_asian_girl_with_albinism_ama/c7vrxza) +10 points

And the glorious GW post I was expecting:

&gt;[Also, you are gorgeous and I'm sure I'm not the first to say that you need to take a look at /r/gonewild](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16fjij/iama_21_year_old_asian_girl_with_albinism_ama/c7vy5ng) +4 points

This jerk of ""Oh you're a girl and hot, let me tell you exactly how hot you are and maybe you'll show me tits"" is disgusting. But it wouldn't be so bad if these comments weren't garnering *thousands* of upvotes. In summary, i mad. i dont like thing.

And, before I go, here's one final comment:

&gt;[So, here I am wondering why the he'll you would be doing an ama over something like this. Then it hit me. You know you're cute and want some attention but too afraid to go to gone wild... :)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/16g6d7/iama_21_year_old_asian_girl_with_albinism_ama/c7vwpiy)

Maybe I'm jaded, but I can't help agreeing with this guy. I'm not surprised to see that there are at least 6 people who don't, though, because this comment is sitting at -5 points.

It was blue because I just don't give a shit about whether Yoko Ono is in fact a good person or not. But for some reason I clicked it, anyway. And what I found appalled me so badly that I sprang, like a hero, to my computer, to write up my discovery.

So, the supreme-reigning comment, at +1432 right now, is a gem of a jerk in itself: 

&gt;""Yoko was and is a terrible, talentless person. yet everytime i post that on reddit i get downvoted like you wouldnt believe. i really dont get you some days, reddit.""

Because the idea that Yoko Ono wasn't wonderful has *never* been seriously entertained by this website before, ever. I have never ever seen anyone receive an upvote for saying ""I don't actually like Yoko Ono."" Ever. (I'm going to try to refrain from employing sarcasm from here on out, otherwise I'll be sarcastic the entire time)

As a parent, I hate the comment. But, as usual, its the children it spawns that I resent even more. The first child points out that John Lennon was a jerk, as though that has any relevance to Yoko Ono's qualities, and from there on it's irrelevant [username-reference](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/154w08/til_julian_lennon_had_to_buy_back_postcards_sent/c7jf73v). This is par for the course but its just weird to me that, among the highest visible comments, with a significant number of upvotes (compared to any other comment on any sub), is a failed attempt at noticing a username, and then having to explain yourself. But that's not really here nor there, its just lame.

Some of the totally useless, unjustified, non-constructive comments bandied about for mass karma include:

&gt;""You are right, but the problem is that most people just say she sucks because she broke up the Beatles. They don't really address her inherent horribleness.""

Which is responded to with: ""oh i am familiar with her work, which is why i dislike her so much. yes she broke up the beatles, but im not over 60, so how does that effect me ya know? no, she is a terrible human being, as evidenced by nearly everyone who ever had the misfortune to meet her. picture courtney love as an asian, thats basically who yoko ono is.""

&gt;""What a gold-digging bitch."" +329 (At least this is in some kind of reference to the submission's point, I guess.)

&gt;""And she wonders why she's the most hated woman in the world..."" +165 

Etc. Etc., absolutely literally hitlerally EVERYONE hates Yoko Ono. Now that we've established that, we can turn to the jerk that *really* grinds my gears, that jerk in which all of Reddit suddenly becomes arbiters of what is and isn't art.

To preface an aesthetic discussion, let me just say that I have studied aesthetics in a philosophical capacity, and so I am frankly well aware that there has never been a universal, cohesive theory of art, that the very question ""what is art,"" is almost impossible, and that all of the key theories (representationalism, expressionism, formalism, institutionalism, etc) fail in key ways to qualify certain aspects of what art is. The point is, aesthetics are not an easy and clear field. 

But that doesn't stop everyone who can pass a judgment on demand to judge art as though art is ONE thing and ONE thing only. Not just Yoko Ono's art, but performance art as well, which leads to attacks on modern art, because apparently all art that isn't pretty painted pictures is basically the same.

There are a lot of these comments under the parent comment thread, so because it's 2 AM I'm just going to copy and paste the relevant ones in a chain without any links. Most of them start from [this comment linking to a recording of a performance](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/154w08/til_julian_lennon_had_to_buy_back_postcards_sent/c7jfbyb). Someone says, ""Uh, its not supposed to sound like pop music, it's performance art,"" which brings on the following aesthetic philosophies:

&gt;""Call it whatever you want, it's still just someone screaming into a microphone like a twat."" +231

(Interestingly, someone responds to this with ""And anyone can throw paint on a canvas, so what,"" which receives two almost identical replies totally devoid of arguments, such as ""nyone can scream into a microphone in different patterns and tones. Arguably, anyone can paint as well, but it takes a bit more skill with a brush and talent with colors. I've been more emotionally moved by a Matisse than I ever will by Yoko's ""singing""."" In this case, clearly art = emotional response, which suggests that this user subscribes to an expressionist school of theory)

&gt;""Yoko Ono is to music what that woman with the Spaghetti-Os in her vagina is to art.""

&gt;""People fucking APPLAUDED that?!""

&gt;""Oh, because YOKO FUCKING ONO has room to judge music. Ever listen to anything that she created?""

(Oh, because SOME RANDOM FUCKING REDDITOR has room to judge an artist from a past era.)

All of that's from the parent comment. The second comment is full-on attacking performance art. It starts with [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/154w08/til_julian_lennon_had_to_buy_back_postcards_sent/c7jcepe). Which leads to:

&gt;Q: ""What was that?"" A: ""Shit. Absolute shit."" (+573 together)

&gt;""People actually clapped and cheered.. wtf.. I dont even want to know how much she was paid to do that."" (+118)

&gt;""Because performance art is fake art. If people truly felt emotion from the art, they wouldn't be afraid to laugh or cry. The audience has a feigned respect for the performer, and is afraid to show how they feel, because they are waiting for some special hidden meaning to strike them, but it never happens. The applause isn't even out of pity or respect, the applause is part of the act and fakery of performance art."" +427

This bad boy is the one that got to me. Although midway in a stream of comments with dwindling karma, this one gets a huge boost, meaning people *really* agree with it. A thread of comments going ""thank you, wow, so beautiful, eloquent, this, literally this, *Probably the most succinct description of performance art and it's audience I've ever read, kudos.*"" follows, sucking that huge brave cock dry. One astute Redditor writes, ""The emperor has no clothes,"" and is himself rewarded with praise for his genius (""You perfectly described this phenomenon in five words. Nice.""). It's just circlejerk within circlejerk for these people. One after another, nonstop, with no breaks. 

Here's a nice little anecdote about why modern art is not real art: ""In college, a friend of mine and I were assigned to go to a museum's ""modern art"" section and write about the pieces. We went to go see the new Punisher movie instead(the Tom Jane one. God Travolta was awful in that one) and made up our writing assignment while drinking later. Full credit. I don't think the art teacher liked modern art either.
""Oh wow, a 30 ft white canvas with a solid vertical line off-center to one side. How brave and evocative..."" fucking bullshit.""

Oh wait. That didn't provide any argument at all. 

&gt;""I think shes mentally ill ever since i saw that video""

On and on...

Maybe you don't like Yoko Ono's art, maybe you think she was a bad influence on Lennon.... Whatever. But she was a well-established, renowned and successful performance artist well before she was ever involved with Lennon, an important part of such fundamental modern artistic traditions as the fluxus movement, John Cage-style composition, etc. One user makes this fairly [clear,](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/154w08/til_julian_lennon_had_to_buy_back_postcards_sent/c7jfvxf) fortunately, and he mentions Dogme 95 as well. The response to this is: ""Well, Dogme 95 produced some legitimately good films, that can actually be enjoyed by someone who doesn't care at all for avant-garde stuff. Festen was quite good (although a bit unsettling). I'm not familiar with fluxus, but has it produced anything with an at least moderately wide appeal?"" In other words, I've never heard of an art movement that anyone who has been to a modern museum should know, was it at least insanely popular? Because if it wasn't mainstream, easily consumable, mass-produced and on Reddit thrice a day, it literally isn't art.

And the video that everyone keeps using to discredit her... They hate it because it sounds bad to their ears. That is all they can give. They have evaluated the piece beyond no other criteria than, is it pleasing to hear, which it is not. Maybe, if they understand one fucking iota about these things, they'd realize that Yoko Ono isn't *trying* to provide pop music for you to enjoy? Maybe there's something more going on in her piece than just someone singing something pretty? I swear, Redditors tend to disparage pop music and rap music for being typical and enjoyable, but if something is NOT typical and enjoyable, and not even TRYING to be, it is judged solely on whether it is typical and enjoyable or not. Talk about hating what you don't understand. Fucking gorillas.

I don't know, I'm rambling on and on about this stuff, I apologize. Maybe I'm making a fuss over nothing. It's just downright farcical to see Redditors stumble over themselves to piss on someone who is infinitely more artistically accomplished than any of them most probably will ever be, just because they aren't capable of appreciating any art that wasn't made using Photoshop, a Sharpie, or melted crayons. And those who ARE able to appreciate performance art are clearly faking it, because if they aren't laughing and crying the entire time, they are not engaging in REAL art.

It's *bad form* in the simplest sense of the phrase to behave like that and be so disrespectful, while betraying a total misunderstanding of the nuances and history of art as an institution. These Redditors are the fat, obnoxious stereotypes in a gallery guffawing ""I may not know art, but I know what I like!!!"" while laughing about the penis on Michelangelo's David.

PS: It isn't all bad. A few people try to defend Yoko, one person suggesting there are racial undertones to peoples' ire towards her. Whether that's true or not, gotta love this guy's reaction: ""It's pretty obvious you're just being a contrarian, Yoko is a pretty disgusting person, 'nuff said, no need to disparage others in her defense, the fact you need to drag other people's names through the mud to make her seem O.K. shows you the depths of her depravity. I've read your comments you don't sound stupid, but, maybe tonight you're feeling a bit bitchy, I dunno, in any case, Yoko poisoned John, emasculated him, and ruined his career."" SHE'S DISGUSTING, NUFF SAID, NO NEED TO EVEN BEGIN TO CONSIDER A BALANCED AND TEMPERATE EVALUATION OF HER.

You guys remember that time when /r/adviceanimals linked to CB in their topbar? If not; it was a few months ago, AA had some bad joke like 'I don't always complain about Reddit, but when I do, I do it on /r/circlebroke'. I don't know why they did this, maybe they were just tired of people complaining on AA, they claimed they wanted to help CB 'grow'. In response the CB-mods (*literally Churchill*) made the sub (and some other IIRC) private for the time being.

Now here's a new case; http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1ea3h6/got_an_essay_due_im_sure_someones_done_this_before/ and here's [the direct image](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3uduzc/). It's an /r/adviceanimals post about a different sub: /r/changemyview.

I wasn't formilliar with CMV, but it's a small sub dedicated to open and civil discussion for people willing to change the way they view things. Containing walls of text, no offtopic jokes and a no-fly rule for people that are *too* certain of themselves, it's almost the complete opposite of /r/adviceanimals.

All well and good, let's first see the responses in the AA thread:

[""We don't write papers, we do science""](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1ea3h6/got_an_essay_due_im_sure_someones_done_this_before/c9yee00)

But this doesn't really bother me, there's no hard jerking, it's not that bad. What is interesting however is the effect this has on /r/ChangeMyView, Let's take a look.

First off, this [mod post](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eajjj/mod_post_welcome_to_all_new_readers/); the bot that they use has crashed and the sub had to be down for 15 minutes, but that's just because of a sudden increase of users. 

The AA post is (now) 6 hours old, so I'm gonna take it that the majority of the posts under 4 hours come from the new users. Let's see how typical redditor responses shine trough, in the posts only:

[""Minority based clubs are racist""](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eaiee/i_believe_that_having_minority_based_clubs_or/), reddit's deal with 'reverse racism'.

[""Religion has no purpose in modern society""](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eahdk/i_believe_religion_has_no_purpose_in_modern/)

[""Higher education should be free""](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eahz6/cmv_higher_education_should_be_provided_at_no/)

[""Traditional gender roles are important in today's society""](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eag7e/i_believe_that_gender_roles_are_still_important/)

[""Star athletes are overpaid""](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eahna/star_athletes_are_just_glorified_overpaid_actors/)

[""People against gay marriage are ignorant""](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eags1/i_believe_anyone_who_is_against_gay_marriage_is/)

Now these were all in the front page of populair, the new queue was... Well it had titles like these:

The best part though are the people who read the ""no Tesla"" rule and made it their job to fight OP's evil anti-science oppression. 

&gt;It's a little ironic that you forbid Telsa from taking part in a survey question about people being screwed over.

OP is [le]terally Thomas ""Hitler"" Edison. 

&gt;In a sense, I don't think Tesla would mind [being excluded] all that much. I mean, he worked to his dying day, and was celebate, just to forward science. And that he did. He wasn't in it for the money, the fame, or the legacy. He was in it for the science.

DAE SCIENCE? Does ignoring the OP make me a martyr for logic and reason yet??

",ActualRAtheismPost,159,27,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/10jqvr/hubris_pseudointellectualism_and_the_neverending/,"I know this involves some smaller subreddits, but watching this type of activity is fascinating and, to me, reveals a microcosm of exactly why places like /r/Atheism are so out of control.

There is a community for ex-Muslims called, unsurprisingly /r/exmuslim. The community in and of itself isn't much of a bother. However, just like /r/Atheism, the community prides itself on logical thinking and rationalism.

So naturally, when a random person appears calling himself a ""Former Community Leader"" of Muslims with few other details, naturally the community vets him, right?

His first post includes this cringe-worthy blog and statement:

&gt;I'm very interested in your feedback. Love? Hate? Tomate? Let me hear it. Here's le link: http://skepticshaykh.wordpress.com/

And the unflinching joyous reaction:

&gt;Oh man, this is exactly what is needed, more ex-Muslims creating content.

And

&gt;Web sites that highlight the journeys of individuals who've struggled with their faith and where those who are currently questioning can interact directly with the blogger are vital, yet few and far between.

Yet, despite his immense ""leadership"" status, when asked to speak in Arabic (a basic requirement for any real Muslim ""Leader""), he replies:

&gt;My Arabic isn't strong enough for me to write anywhere near at the same level. =(

This person also seems to be having a real identity crisis. When he posts in /r/Exmuslim, he is careful to always point out that he doesn't believe in Islam. However, when he posts in /r/Islam, he howls and says that nobody should ever be allowed to treat him as an ""outsider to the Muslim community."" I can't find it now, but I remember a post at some point asking why it wasn't okay to be a ""non-Muslim Muslim."" 

No matter, /r/ExMuslim needs a leader.

Later he declares:

&gt;How to learn more about Islam than most scholars (let alone Muslims) very quickly.

Nobody rush to point out that he hasn't really shown any proof of scholar-level knowledge about the religion in the first place, let alone the fact he readily admits he lacks the very first step of becoming a scholar. For his resource, he actually cites a scholar who works at Georgetown, who is in his early 30's, and has only penned one or two books on Islam and who readily admits he is an amateur in the field and is ""blown away"" when watching those who have done hadith studies their whole life. Nevermind that though, this single person is CLEARLY the source for knowledge because it backs up his premise, right?





**So far, while this is just a bit of delusion and hubris, it couldn't possibly cause much more of a problem, right?**

Skeptic Shaykh decides to take his practice further: he begins visiting other websites and attempting to troll the boards. He is so proud of his efforts that he gleefully declares his superiority in the form of his own threads.

&gt;Muslim blog Suhaibwebb.com decides to write about apostasy. Couldn't resist.

To which he naturally gets a delicious circlejerk.

The worst of it all, though, is that when a LEGITIMATE, educated, highly advanced researcher of Islam shows up, Skeptic Shaykh decides that he is the ultimate David ready to topple this Goliath.

Forget that Skeptic Shaykh is trying to argue against a REAL Muslim Community Leader (while SS doesn't seem to even have evidence of his former leadership at all), and forget that he hasn't shown the slightest bit of Arabic knowledge while Nouman Ali Khan is both FLUENT and studied in classical Arabic literature. Forget even that, while SS thinks he is a ""Former Community Leader,"" this much more knowledgeable individual refuses to even call himself a scholar (a title SS believes he can arrogantly outstrip in a couple books and videos). SS still takes on the challenge:

First, SS asserts his knowledge:

&gt; If there's any video/audio of yours I've probably seen/heard it, and the same goes for most of the popular public du'aat (preachers). I know the material quite well, I've taught how to teach and argue in favor of Islam effectively. 

See, he KNOWS all of Mr. Khan's work. Not only that, he's taught others. He's clearly a superior figure. But he had an epiphany!

&gt;Quiet frankly after learning more, being genuine to myself and giving an honest critique, none of it stands ground.

Unfortunately, Mr. Khan's answer to SS's question (would you listen to rational evidence that disproved God?) is gone to the winds of live video (unsurprisingly, people busy mastering a skill typically don't understand Rediquitte because they aren't here all the time). It was quite nuanced, and essentially boiled down to ""I was an agnostic myself, I have observed the evidence, and I have made a concerted decision."" Of course, SS declares victory:

&gt;My back and forth with Nouman Ali Khan, I enjoyed this too much!

And naturally, his retelling of the story is considerably generous to his position.

I really enjoy some of them, but most of them are boring. I'm not really interested in digging any deeper than last month's posts, but here are a few examples of some pretty shameless pandering.

So first up is basically the redditor's hero brought to life: [le brave atheist murderer marine who has a *hiss* money grubbing, ""wife.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/183gn2/a_conversation_i_had_with_my_exwife_semirecently/)

I'll do a tl;dr for ya'll even though it's a short story.

&gt;I'm in the Army. I've been Special Forces for about seven years now.

So he's army, but not only that: he's SPECIAL forces.

&gt;as a medic

No man would be perfect without an ounce of science.

&gt;Judy is gay.

Not a choice quote, but I'm too lazy to go back for another one. Judy is his gay wife. So we now have a special forces man married to a gay woman for benefits. 

&gt;[kills an enemy combatant]... I didn't even know this man's name. I didn't really care.

We've got a stoic badass military man not afraid to kill with a living arrangement with a gay woman. 

&gt;I wish I could say that the the final straw hadn't been having to cut into this young man's stomach and remove his intestines and show them to him as he screamed the coordinates in Arabic to my translator. 

So here he is torturing enemy combatants. So what didn't faze our hardened atheist brave soldier caused the translator to cry. This is reading like a wet dream.

&gt;Anyway, that translator shot himself later that night. I still wish I could tell you his name.

What a badass.

&gt;It was at this point that he reached for the phone and I broke his hand. He yelled for his wife to wake up, but she didn't. Jeremy began to cry.

So in the beginning of the story there was a fellow soldier who gave him shit for killing an enemy combatant. The first kill that I mentioned. He is now at this soldier's house in arkansas. How is he there, you ask? He mission impossible'd his way into the house, tranquilized the wife, and announced that he'd kill the guy in 2 years. Let me repeat the middle part. HE TRANQUILIZED THE WIFE. Oh and by the way, it wasn't his first time in the house. He had been there multiple times before. He was undetected all times before, of course.

&gt;Tina's eyes rolled into the back of her head. She was clearly unconscious. I relented and turned to Judy.

Gay wife gets gay girl friend who convinces gay wife to file for divorce and take his money. Literally. So at a meeting between the three of them, the guy chokes the living shit out of the wife's gf, tina, and delivers some speech about being a badass that the gays don't want to mess with. You'll love the conclusion: ""NEEDLESS TO SAY, SHE MOVED OUT."" NEEDLESS TO SAY.

Story ends with him flying to go kill his gay ex wife's family. To be honest, I'm at nosleep for paranormal stories. Gore ain't my taste. But I'm not against it. I'm just pointing out how obnoxious this story is. It would be a little jarring if it weren't so damn unbelievable. 


Story Two: [introvert jerk](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1852bj/my_friend_jeremy/)
&gt;My parents, however, were concerned that they’d raised a socially retarded mute who’d no doubt grow up to take drugs and mutilate cats or something - so they instantly over spoke me and told them that of course I would. They subsequently encouraged me with their gentle ‘go on, go and get some fresh air’. I didn’t need the fresh air, I didn’t want the fresh air, I just wanted my fucking dessert, but evidently I wasn’t getting one. I never forgave him for that, but that’s not why he’s dead. In fact, I didn’t even kill him.

Story could basically be told without the part about him being an introvert or whatever the hell it is redditors call their antisocial asses. This happens a lot on the subreddit, but in the spirit of friday, I can't be assed to find more examples.

Story 3: [about a girl who used to wear too much make up](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1692on/all_the_papers_lied_tonight/)

&gt;I’d never had to chase a guy before. It’s not that I’m Angelina Jolie or anything, it’s just that I used to spend an enormous amount of time and money making myself look nothing like myself. You've seen the old me, or one of my countless clones: a golem of silicone and acrylic, spangles and bleach. It was a lot like being a zombie, I suppose; you can barely move for fear that parts of you will fall off.

Self explanatory

But being a news/politics junkie I searched for other subreddits to get my fix. I subscribed to /r/libertarian and found it to be a lot more to my liking. Discussions and articles that I enjoyed reading. But then things started the change, the jerk became stronger... Maybe it was the election, or maybe it was always this way and I never noticed before. But now it seems /r/libertarian is limited to four types of posts. 

1.  Picture with wall of text (sound familiar /r/atheism?)   
2.  Memes  (college liberal, amirite?)   
3.  News article that results in a circlejerk.   
4.  Self-post that results in a circlejerk.   

I feel like I only subscribe to /r/libertarian to roll my eyes every so often and cross my fingers that maybe today is the day a quality post will pop up again. Today we will be looking at number 4. [This post](http://np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/16omrp/i_wish_my_liberal_friends_were_as_passionate/) popped up today, it's currently #1 on /r/libertarian. I clicked and dove in to a very brave OP.   

__________________________    


Now, let's just take a moment to admire the title of the post,   

&gt;  **I wish my liberal friends were as passionate about defending my reproductive rights as they are about taking away my rights to defend myself.**   

Right away, we know we're in for something good.     

&gt; I was thinking about posting this on r/politics, but that would be going against the hive mind and it'd be down-vote city since apparently everyone thinks the up/down arrows are ""agree/disagree"" buttons.   

Wow. I thought about posting it in /r/politics, but why post it where people might have a different opinion when I can come here and get all the upvotes I need.   

&gt; I'm normally very liberal on most of the issues, but taking away gun rights is not one of them.  

Don't worry guys, I'm just like you!   

&gt; Everywhere I look it's ""gun control! gun control! GUN CONTROL!!!"". It's like a beast has finally been awoken.    

It's so weird! A mass shooting is being covered by the news and has a renewed a debate that's been going on for decades. What a shock!    

&gt; I just can't seem to get them to understand that the way they're acting is like conservatives with regard to abortion.    

I guess...  Let's roll with it!   

&gt; There's no reasoning with them either. They're whipped up into an emotional frenzy...   

Can't reason with liberals guys, they just don't understand!    

&gt; so they want to punish me, a law abiding citizen    

Ah the classic cry of /r/libertarian.     

__________________________________________________________       

Well, let's check the comments. Surely they will calm the OP down and bring a little reason to the gun control debate.

My god the bravery is just oozing out now.    

As you can imagine, this continues for a while. There are some posts sitting at 0 or -1 that attempt to start an actual discussion, but nobody is biting. A couple snarky comments at around -3. But then we see this one at -9. It seems like a legitimate question, although it could simply be baiting.

If you're subscribed to /r/cringe, you know that posts like this show up practically every week. I swear, I've never seen a subreddit more actively hated by its users. What's particularly baffling about this post, though, and the reason that I'm writing about it, is the assertion that the decline of /r/cringe took place entirely within the last month. It's hilariously clueless, considering how often these posts come about. But there's something deeper here, I think. 

There's an entitlement aspect going on. OP's first comment on /r/cringe? [One month ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/11sqs2/just_click_around_on_scenekidscom_every_profile/c6pc86y) Seriously. I think that people assume that quality has gone downhill, when the reality is that the place was never all that good to begin with, and the more time you spend on it, the more the shit stands out to you (and the less you're willing to forgive it.) OP has only been on /r/cringe for one month, we can assume, and one month later he's lamenting the tragic fall of what was once such a great subreddit. You're not entitled to nothing but great content. Maybe try submitting some yourself. Oh wait, turns out he has submitted to the subreddit. Only twice. [The first one](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/1398o2/that_phantom_load/) got 23 upvotes, and [the second one](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/13tkzq/leave_behind_your_carphones_and_beepers_its_time/) got only 3. See, that's perfectly indicative of something else.

What also boggles the mind is that no one on /r/cringe seems to realize how subjective the feeling that the sub is based around actually is. You think that just because you're all on the same website you're all going to cringe at the same stuff? It doesn't make any sense. And on a subreddit where quality is determined by how much you cringed at something, of course you're not going to like every single post. Most people didn't like yours, in fact. Quit whining and get over it. Here's a comment:

&gt; [To the people bitching about posts like these, you are actually part of the problem. This subreddit was created for what OP is describing, but it's devolved into stupidity instead of actual cringe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringe/comments/14jid8/this_subreddit_fucking_blows_now_in_less_than_a/c7dn1sf)

Not sure that OP described anything in his post. No statement of what ""true cringe"" actually is, probably because *there is no such thing*. Even if he could explain exactly the elements that a submission needs to qualify as ""true cringe,"" there's no way that a consensus could be reached on that. /r/cringe is, in a lot of ways, the opposite of /r/Frisson, a great subreddit which you should check out. The feeling of frisson is just as subjective as cringing, but there, the users are aware that differences in opinion are inevitable and don't write bitchy posts about how we need to ""bring back true frisson!"" 

Now, the vast majority of the comments are actually calling OP out for this repetitive, whiny post, but it's still at the top of the subreddit with over 1000 upvotes at the time of this writing. And you can bet that there'll be another post just like it with just as many upvotes next week. Why is this?

You see, the people making these posts want to believe that they're the ""old crowd"" of /r/cringe, the people who have been around long enough to know that these new kids don't know what they're doing. They aren't, of course. OP has only been around for a month. But it gives them a sense of power to be able to say, ""Well, back in my day, /r/cringe was much better than the shit we have nowadays!"" 

So, what I'm saying is, CB is shit now.

Bonus points for addressing Reddit's personal proclivities. Please bear with me through this, because I have a tendency to rant.

The top comment thread is an obvious karma grab, although benign in and of itself. The next two top comment threads involve urine and masturbation, nothing new for Reddit. The fourth comment thread, however, starts with my favorite Redditism of all:

Reddit-to-English:

""Just admit it, you only have female friends because you want to fuck them. I mean, what else are they good for?""

Beside the fact that these comments marginalize female friends into a subset of ""potential fuck-buddies"", this entire line of reasoning is fraught with hypocrisy and self-defeating behavior. Oh, but the karmatrain must go on!

I would also like to point out that while this reply to the original comment stands at ~~+1498~~ (nope, as I was typing this, it jumped to +1940), the **next highest reply** only stands at +69. This means that a vast majority of Redditors who read that initial statement and the following reply empathized so much with this sentiment that they barreled on down the karma train without so much as looking for a dissenting opinion.

This passive attitude toward relationships has always fascinated me; at one point in my life I would have empathized with them. However, having learned from my mistakes, I can see how absolutely defeatist these attitudes are.

On one hand, people who think like this get drunk on their own misery, wallowing in low self-expectations and self-criticism. On the other hand, they match their own loneliness with unreachable expectations of what they deserve and arrogant judgement of others.

Though the tribute i bring to your mighty half eaten pizzabox thrones be less mighty than glaring examples or racism in /r/funny, misogyny in /r/gaming, or bravery in /r/atheism, I still bring it forward and hope you, in your hairy necked wisdom will accept this humble gift. 

The politics of marijuana legalization is a sticky (lol dank) subject. While there is data and science (contain yourself, reddit) involved the argument, there is also a great deal of misinformation that really clouds the debate. Marijuana has been proven to have a real positive effect for people with serious medical problems. It doesn't cure disease, as some might wishfully claim, but it does help stimulate appetite and lessen pain. This is a positive thing and I think that most people, even in the contrarian-jerk of CB would agree that pot has medical applications. 

California has hence allowed medical marijuana dispensaries to operate within their state, with questionable legality and a whole lot of jurisdiction dick measuring between Federal and State agencies. One would think that the pot community would see this as a good step towards legalizing it for everyone, not just those with serious medical conditions. A great opportunity to help prove this can be a real positive thing for communities!

[NOPE.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/12i789/on_how_easy_it_is_to_get_a_medical_marijuana_card/) Instead we get a thread about how sweet and easy it is to scam the system.Exactly what opponents of medical marijuana are afraid of. 

We have a commenter telling OP that he got ripped off and should have payed far less for his prescription drug abuse scheme. 

We have ents from across the country letting OP know how jealous they are that OP lives in a state that would dare to trust people not to abuse a system that has the potential to help a lot of people.

I can't act like I'm that surprised, this is the place that routinely has difficulty rationalizing why you ought not to drive a car while intoxicated. 

I guess this just frustrates me. The fact is that every other state in America is going to look at the California example before they decide if its something they want to try. This type of abusing the system really just provides ammo for the opposition. ""Damn hippies are just going to make up bullshit medical excuses to use it"" SO WHAT DO YOU GO DO? YOU GO AND DO EXACTLY THAT. Its jeopardizing access to medicine that could help a lot of people that actually need it. 

I'm sure I've missed a lot of whats going on here, o great cheeto dusted overlords. But I humbly submit this rant in the hopes that it will appease our elder gods. So CB, what do you think!

If you're like myself, you might skip reading the original post and go right to what my post has to say, but I encourage you to look at the linked article.

&gt; TIL that Walt Disney's last words were ""Kurt Russell,"" and that no one, including Kurt Russell, knows what he meant. 

Huh. What an odd story. Almost too odd to be true.

Well in fact, it *is* too odd to be true. As [this article](http://www.mouseplanet.com/9734/Walts_Last_Words_NOT_Kurt_Russell) from /u/soillodge points out, Mr. Russell's name was merely one of the last things Disney wrote on paper (if you want to get technical, Russell's name wasn't even his last written words, rather they were ""3. CIA-Mobley""). No one knows for certain what Disney's last spoken words were.

Now here's why I wanted you to look at the original article from WikiQuote. Notice how Disney's name isn't there anymore? That's because the article (and its debunking article) got so much attention that users removed Disney's words from the page. Mystery solved, right?

Well, don't ever let the facts get in the way of a good story. As of right now, the article, which I want to reiterate has been proven to be an urban legend, sits at fourth on TIL at +1741. What's worse, [the comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/115318/til_that_walt_disneys_last_words_were_kurt/c6jlohv) pointing out that the statement is bullshit sits at *fifth* in the comments.

Now wait a second, didn't the OP ask 
&gt; So republicans of Reddit please tell me how on earth you can vote for Romney/ the republican idea? Economy, welfare, social, common health etc. Thank you

But I guess a liberal telling the republicans side of the story is just [too advanced for my insane Republican mind to comprehend](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/zljrz/hey_reddit_as_a_norwegian_i_cannot_understand_how/c65mwqt).

&gt;[That's absurd. The republicans stand up for the individual? Unless you are a woman, then they want the state to dictate their birth control and reproductive choices. Republicans want the state to own the uterus and female sexuality. If you're a minority, you will be used as the villian in their lazy welfare narrative. How do republicans protect the working and middle class? They don't. They protect big business and the wealthy.
I cannot be an apologist for the democratic party because, far too often, they merely play along with republicans excess due to lack of balls. But then, perhaps they are choreographed to play the faux opponent until most Americans forget how awful republican policies were to their economic interests.
Don't even start about fiscal responsibility. Under Dubya, the debt was doubled from 6 to 11 trillion. There was a huge expansion of government. Small government, my ass. Everything was put on the national credit card, nothing was paid for since they abolished the ""pay as you go"" rule established under Clinton.
Republicans are war loving religious fascists who reject the science of climate change, the need for national health care, disprespect the rights of women and the economic opportunity of the ""individual,"" which you claim they support. Sure, you can be an individual, code for ""you're on your own,"" and forget about Medicare and Social Security that you paid into your whole life.

Oh cool.  In a thread that specifically asks republicans what they believe, another non-republican telling me what I believe and why I believe it.  

&gt;[My father and a few friends are Republican voters. When I ask them why, after 10 minutes or so of blaming democrats for every thing, they explain the following: They believe in a free market that when corporations get huge amounts of tax breaks they do the following with the money:
Invest into research and development\(R&amp;D\). This ideally means the corporation will become more competitive, creating new or more efficient products for consumers/customers.
Give back to their employees in the ways of pay increases, better health care, etc.
Create more jobs because of the excess of income. Ideally this is great. It doesn't happen, unfortunately. Corporate higher ups invest their money into themselves, and move corporate money overseas for cheaper labor/better savings. They blame this on regulation, ""Why would I want to invest in a country when I can just save tons of money overseas, not have to worry about unions, get better interest in oversea banks and have little to no taxes?""
They have more arguments but those are generally the first things that come out. Gay marriage/abortion/failing middle class are the follow-ups.

ALSO WHITE!

&gt;[There are a couple of reasons:
Party loyalty often has people indoctrinated not to consider the actual politics. This party stands for X, I like X, so I'm voting for them. It doesn't even have to align with reality. If you look at the electoral map, it's easy to see how the country is 'divided' between us and them. The south and the midwest are 'GOP territory' and the coasts are 'Democratic territory', with only a few states on the fence \(funnily enough those states tend to be 'border states', on the line between to traditionally opposed territories\).
Single issue voters: ""Sure I understand that Mitt Romney is the anti-christ and that voting for him will herald the apocalypse and destroy mankind, but I have to vote for him. He's the pro-life candidate.""
Media brainwashing. If you only watch fox news and listen to conservative media, then you're caught in the GOP Echo Chamber. This means that you only ever hear the spin they put on things. You hear Obama telling people that ""They didn't build that"" with no context. You hear how he's ""Apologizing for America"" and spending ""$10 billion dollars and taking a third of the US Navy"" for a one week trip overseas. You hear how he's not an American, not a Christian, not a believer in Capitalism, that he hates the country and is perpetuating a war on religion. When that's all you hear because you've been taught not to turn the channel, it's easy.
A firm belief that a vote for the Republican Party is a vote for God. (No, seriously)](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/zljrz/hey_reddit_as_a_norwegian_i_cannot_understand_how/c65oh1d)

I actually agree with Reddit's general position on this, but as usual, Reddit takes it too far. They're not asking or discussing this in order to really find out why. They're doing it to insult America, insult Christians, insult the FCC (an example Reddit's anti-Government libertarianism, popping up when most convenient to them), insult people whose values are different than their's, and to circlejerk over how much more logical they are than others in this OBVIOUSLY objective valuation of media content.

Of course, Reddit PHRASES these threads in the form of a question, but strangely, the threads never have answers or a good back and forth debate or discussion.

I also think this jerk encompasses a lot of other Reddit jerks in one delicious neopolitan jerk. Or perhaps tutti-frutti. (BTW, as a neckbeard who eats a lot of junkfood when gaming, DAE hate HFCS, fat chicks, and Amerilards?) To butcher the Coen Brother's True Grit, I shall try to explain how this encompasses these other jerks, but let us restrict the conversation to the /r/BreakingBad thread(s) so that we may have a manageable figure of examples to work with!

One of Reddit's theories: [Fucking plebeian Americans!](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/yi899/mikes_note_uncensored_courtesy_of_4chan/c5vtqb9)

Never-mind the fact that America has plenty of shows like The Sopranos, Deadwood, The Newsroom, Sex &amp; The City, Lucky Louie, with uncensored swearing on premium cable channels like HBO and Showtime. Obviously [MURRICA](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/zc9tw/tv_network_logic/c63dita) (lol, get it, guys, Rednecks yell things like MERICKA!) must be the problem. Notice when [user Kranar attempts to argue that it has nothing to do with America,](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/yi899/mikes_note_uncensored_courtesy_of_4chan/c5vzen0) he gets downvoted, to -16 points. Reddit really hates nuance.

More of Kranar getting downvoted:

&gt;Plenty of American media contains vulgar language, nudity and mature, uncensored content. Sopranos was American and had plenty of all of the above. I really don't see how AMC deciding to censor the word fuck is some kind of American cultural issue. If it was shown on HBO, another American channel, it would not have had any censorship.

[-16 points](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/yi899/mikes_note_uncensored_courtesy_of_4chan/c5w07hx) for stating a fact. Clearly those downvotes are well deserved, Kranar, how dare you question the hivemind? A response:

&gt;HBO is premium cable, and if I'm not mistaken, AMC is technically basic cable. Different standards. HBO can get away with nudity and vulgarity because they're a pay channel, AMC can't, it's as simple as that. I think exceptions are made if they put up disclaimers, but I doubt AMC wants to air a 10 second disclaimer after each commercial break.

[+7 points](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/yi899/mikes_note_uncensored_courtesy_of_4chan/c5w0fk0) for stating something very similar Kranar did. This guy CONFIRMS Kranar's point, that it has nothing to do with MURRICA, but with differing bodies of overseeing the content of television (premium vs. basic cable) Notice this guy doesn't mention both standards are American in origin, even though that's Kranar's point.

&gt;Okay fine, then it's as simple as the difference between basic cable and premium cable. Why does it need to be turned into some kind of cultural/political issue about America

[-5 downvotes.](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/yi899/mikes_note_uncensored_courtesy_of_4chan/c5w0k8c) NEGATIVE FIVE DOWNVOTES. At this point in reading the thread Jorge blacked out and woke up three hours later with his temples smelling of dried blood. Weird.

That last link has a whole tree of SRD-style quality popcorn!

That's why! That's the answer, religion is the DIRECT reason Breaking Bad is allowed to portray simulated murders but not swearing. And if religion hadn't made MURRICA so puritanical and afraid of the human body nudity would be 100% accepted in America as it is in Europe! I wonder how many of the people who upvoted that are nudists or who would willingly be nude in front of their parents or want to see their parents nude. The fact is, shame and/or embarrassment about the nude body is ingrained into humans.

[The man who brought us /r/Jailbait explains that this is because AMERICANS HATE SEX but LOVE violence](http://www.reddit.com/r/breakingbad/comments/zc9tw/tv_network_logic/c63edwu) +28 points.

&gt;""Fuck"" means ""sex"", and sex is always bad, while violence is not.

This comment pretty much sums up the entire jerk in one sentence. The creator of a subreddit that was shut down for distributing child pornography criticizing puritanical MURRICA for hating profanity &amp; sex (which are the same thing is his statement) but not violence. Everyone knows America LOVES violence, and war, which was caused by RELIGION. Even his subreddit flair, ""I fingered Jane's corpse"" is perfect. Sublime. Bliss. Rage.

Again, the worst part about this jerk is that when Reddit asks itself why this apparent double standard exists, the question never gets answered. People who provide theories get downvoted, and conversation is cut off. But let me provide some theories about. First, here's perhaps why Reddit gets so up in arms about this one:

Reddit loves to think of itself as a drastic and edgy website, and can't imagine other people having different sensibilities than them. They have the mentality of 13 year old boys who just learned to swear, who then run away from their house so they can yell it as loud as they can without being heard. FUCK! SHIT! CUNT! They consider themselves highly evolved, so that media content can't affect them. 

Reddit thinks they're mature because they like ""mature"" themes in their media and have a youthful arrogance and excitement over ""taboo,"" ""forbidden,"" ""naughty things! Reddit's version of maturity has nothing to do with being an adult with responsibilities to children, which involves moderation. Reddit is stuck in a responsibility-less adolescent view of media, a hedonistic, anything goes love of novelty and edginess.

Now, here's MY theory on why violence is more accepted in media than sex and profanity:

The reason violence is more acceptable on basic cable and broadcast television than profanity and nudity is because violence is simulated and whereas nudity and profanity cannot be.

It's the same reason I can watch a Scorsese film and enjoy it, but why a gore thread or raid from 4chan, with pictures of actual citizens with their heads caved in, scars me for life. And Reddit knows this. That's why they insist posts like that be tagged with NSFL, even on subreddits like WTF. Violence in fictional television &amp; film is ABSTRACTED, removed from reality, even if it's done with realistic make-up and effects. We know it's 100% not real.

Nudity, meanwhile, isn't. If you're a parent and you watch a movie with nudity, your child is ACTUALLY seeing a womans actual breasts or vagina, or a man's real penis. It's not all that abstracted or simulated.

Swearing is even more immediate, because it's invasive. So when a television show has swearing, the swearing takes place within your home. If I'm watching Goodfellas in my living room and my mom is in the kitchen next to it cooking, it's extremely easy for her to ignore the graphic violence, which she hates, or even the nudity. She feels completely comfortable doing so, it's easy for her to block out and ignore, and is again, abstracted. But when Pesci starts in with saying ""fuck this,"" and ""fuck that,"" my mom is hearing it, and I begin to feel guilty. She begins feeling uncomfortable. She only wanted to cook a meal, and my choice of media is flooding her space with language she hates. It might as well be me telling her ""fuck"" and ""cunt."" Why not? There's no abstraction there, and the sensory effect experienced by the consumer is the same. 

Personally, I think parents should monitor what their kids watch more readily, and that it's their responsibility to limit media exposure. But Reddit is so arrogant in its position and has its head so far its collective ass that I actually hope the Hayes Code gets brought back and every film has to be rated G from now on.

I believe in rational discussion about this situation because I find it incredibly fascinating from a sociology standpoint, but I can't claim not to be biased by the incredible amount of slander and misinformation being supported by the reddit community.

It starts with [this post.](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iu67f/xmen_first_look_days_of_future_past_posters_split/) X-men posters. Apart from accusations of /r/hailcorporate or whatever, we allow new movie posters to be submitted, and if we banned such alerts we would be cutting off our noses to spite our faces. Makes little sense. However, we only allow *new* posters, or OC fan art (we support the idea of people celebrating movies so much that they make sculptures/posters on their own, as long as they aren't in /r/movies just to sell their work, which is illegal due to intellectual property laws).

Then a few days later [this post](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3e73/fixed_the_eyes_on_the_xmen_days_of_future_past/) appeared, and hit the front page before anyone noticed. It's a modified version of the first post, just with the eyes leveled (and other minor differences). I removed it as soon as I saw it. Then the user asked why, and in a nutshell, this was our modmail exchange:

Me: 

----------

For one, it's a response to another post, which by definition should be made within the other post.

Two, it's not new information, nor is it fanart. We allow posters when it's new information regarding the movie coming out. Otherwise it belongs in /r/movieposterporn

Third, the point of this subreddit is for discussion of movies and movie news, whereas this discussion is about a modified movie poster.

and Fourth, the popularity doesn't matter. It in fact works against you, because we don't want to encourage more posts like this (which popular posts always do)

Nothing personal. I dig what you did, it's just not /r/movies material. The post still exists, you still get the karma, but it's not on our front page anymore. Hope you understand.

-------------

then the user:

-----------

Sigh.  I hate burning bridges, but...  it's not like I really ever post in this subreddit *anyway*, so I might as well be as honest and outspoken as my post history would suggest I am.

So, in closing, I have to say... for one, it was not a response to another post.  I might have first seen the posters (low res, covered in watermarks and URLs) in the Reddit feed awhile back, but I discovered and modified them only after viewing the much newer high res pics on [Superherohype](http://www.superherohype.com/news/articles/178381-hi-res-versions-of-the-new-x-men-days-of-future-past-posters) this morning.  I even linked directly to their pics at first, but the links soon broke, so I migrated them over to imgur.

Two, I don't see why the fact it's not new (although these *are* HD, logoless, and properly aligned, whereas the originals were *not*) or fan art should matter.  If it were a superfluous fix, I'd understand.  But then again, I wouldn't expect it to have been so popular, were that the case, so clearly I had the majority's support.  And isn't that the point of Reddit's pseudo-democratic system, after all?  Well, more on that in a bit.

Three, you say this is a subreddit for discussion of movies, but this post has spurred quite a bit of discussion about the design choices made in the material that has been released so far for this upcoming movie, and more, including such topics as multi-actor based characters in other movie franchises as well.  Discussions which are still going on right now.  (well, as of the time I started typing this, anyway)  [Example.](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3e73/fixed_the_eyes_on_the_xmen_days_of_future_past/cbaslk6)  [Example.](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3e73/fixed_the_eyes_on_the_xmen_days_of_future_past/cbasn13)  [Example.](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3e73/fixed_the_eyes_on_the_xmen_days_of_future_past/cbavmew) [Example.](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3e73/fixed_the_eyes_on_the_xmen_days_of_future_past/cbatg8u) [Example.](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j3e73/fixed_the_eyes_on_the_xmen_days_of_future_past/cbasvjw)  Why that's to be *discouraged*, I could only guess..  (don't support independent film criticism, perhaps? \*shrug\*)

and Four, the popularity *should* matter.  If a subreddit is no longer democratic, and the votes don't matter, then that subreddit's *community* no longer matters, and I do *not* think that's the kind of message you want to be sending to *anyone*.  Your job as a moderator is to keep things in line.  Review flagged comments.  Make sure posts (mostly) adhere to the rules.  If and when the users skirt those rules, it should be up to the rest of the community to decide whether or not they support that divergence, by voting it *up* or *down.*  If you disapprove, then you should *voice* such disapproval *in reply.*  That's what your nifty little green name tag is for, after all!  What you should *not* do, however, is tear that post down without any given notice, at your sole discretion.  When that starts to happen (and it's been happening for some time, in all manner of subs, and I have been vocal about it), then that means the mods are picking the winners and the losers, and that's not fair.  When visitors start to see that about Reddit, they will resent you for it, and no longer find this site worthy of their time.

*Finally,* ""post still exists, you still get the karma""?  *Really?*  Patronization?  That's how you choose to wrap things up?  Well thanks *so much* for letting me keep all that *karma* people *gave* me.  It means *so* much to me, that you would do that for me.  \*condescending finger twirl\*  You know, *because I totally do it all for the points!*

\*clears throat\*

But don't get me wrong.  It's nothing personal.  I dig that you're a pro Redditor and all.  I'm sure you're very good it.  I mean, it looks like you even have one or two successful submissions *not* in the subreddit you lord over!  ...I just don't think you're quite *Mod* material, is all.  At least, not if you've any intention to continue moderating like *this*, anyway.

Good day.

*PS:  My favorite movies are, in no particular order:  Fight Club, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Mr. Nobody.*

-------------------------

I didn't argue, because I've been down this path countless times. We run a massive sub with heavy moderation, goes with the territory.

Then today one of the other mods noticed [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1j71nm/edward_snowdens_not_the_story_the_fate_of_the/cbbvdo0) from our bitter user. I'm not even sure where he got this theory, and he hasn't responded in modmail when it was brought up.

So what is he referring to? Therein lies the mystery of this entire post. I'm one of the most active mods and I can't account for any behavior that he's accusing us of, yet 413 other redditors read his comment, and *agreed* with such zeal that they upvoted him. Well, 607 upvoted him, by RES count.

Then we got [this guy](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1j71nm/edward_snowdens_not_the_story_the_fate_of_the/cbbwe2z) with his 45 upvotes.

There's a massive amount of attempted pscyho-analysis of our moderation but *no one asks us anything*. We've been [enormously transparent](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/yrbmq/if_we_cant_talk_about_piracy_can_we_talk_about/) whenever [a meta post](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ir79m/psa_if_you_tell_someone_there_is_a_twist_in_a/cb7alxs?context=3) pops up. 

So what we have is dozens to hundreds of redditors trying to make broad generalizations about moderators *with no evidence* and actively rejecting any testimonial from actual moderators. At that point, what evidence can even be discussed? If it's all user-generated baseless theory- why would anyone get mad about it?

Now moderator-hating is nothing new, I know. We've been [through it before.](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1ak0fq/pic_of_a_dude_handwriting_out_the_entire_script/c8y5j6z?context=3) And [it'll happen again.](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1f9x5y/im_samuel_l_jackson_and_ill_record_a_video_of_me/ca89l7j?context=3)

But the truly fascinating thing, to me, is that the scandal is more delicious than the truth. If I were to make a video or a post called "" a day in the life of /r/movies moderation"" we'd get very little attention, because it's boring as hell and not nearly the puppet-master operation that reddit thinks it is. Is it because reddit is just insecure and hates any form of authority? I'm sure that's a large part of it, but I also think that reddit needs something to complain about to feel superior to their surroundings, as well as have an entity to blame for their unhappiness.

Now our original user in this situation isn't a target here so much as just another example in this whole dynamic. It happens once a month, so I don't mean to single him out as a super-special case that deserves negativity, this is purely for the clinical observation of the crowd-dynamics of reddit.

Everytime I see a thread like that /r/worldnews one, my opinions about politics get stronger and stronger. Moderating a default sub is extremely similar to being a politician. Our words will be nit-picked and twisted up by the dozens or millions of people who read them. We set legislation to help my people lead happier lives in this tiny corner of existence. We listen to the users and tilt the subreddit the way the pulse of the people desire. And, like I imagine politicians, we get massive amounts of negativity from people who haven't the slightest idea what they're talking about. And there's *always* going to be unhappy people, because if daily moderating a default sub for 18 months has taught me anything, it's that a) Can't make everyone happy, and b) The people cannot govern themselves.

Oh, and as for the accusations that we work as Studio PR people, let's just take a look again at what the inciting removed submission was, the one that started this whole thing - [*another round of X-Men posters.*](http://imgur.com/a/iEMII)

 I really don't know if I should even post this, what can be said that hasn't been said before.  /r/gaming is /r/atheism in a different form.  This circlejerk is obvious to anyone familiar to video games on Reddit.  MS and Xbox hate has been the talk of the entire community for weeks now.  But this day in particular seems to be even more terrible about it.  With the recent news of alleged MS involvement with the NSA (among other companies) and a published set of policies for the new Xbox, /r/gaming *as well as* all of the Reddit games community in in outrage.

 Now I do know, not all reactions have been negative.  In fact, I am not too upset by any of this.  I really look forward to what devs can do with the assumption that all Xboxes will have internet connections and kinect sensors.  I think those two things can create very immersive and creative experiences.  But that aside, if I did not like these things what would I do?  Hold an indifference to what is essentially a luxury entertainment device.  But beyond my opinion, there is a noticeable counter reaction to all this.  I don't think I would call it a counter jerk, but rather a small semblance of reasonable comments.

 But this reaction against MS isn't new nor unique to MS.  Wherever you go its about hate toward companies and publishers and love towards Steam and indies.  So this is really why I question doing any kind of post here at all.  As much as I wish it to be, this reaction is normal and not special.  This is day to day and indications of the gaming industry as a whole.

&gt; Damn, Microsoft seems pretty dedicated to creating a bizarre Orwellian gaming system. Complete with in home government surveillance.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps they should have called it ""Xbox 1984"".

Which then spawns the new subreddit /r/xbox1984.  This one I can probably get the most, and not surprising considering all things.  With the NSA spying thing, and a ""always on"" camera, 1984 would be the expected response.  Hell, I'd probably do this IRL.  Maybe the circlejerk is rational this time?  The world we live in.

 * [This sitting at +600:](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fuj2v/im_sorry_ive_defended_you_for_too_long/cady7qa)

&gt;While the constant ""Xbox One sucks"" posts can be extremely annoying; I must say they've opened my eyes. I've been trying to stick by the master chief's side, but the more I find out about the Xbox One, the more I sense myself loving the idea of getting my first playstation.

Which reminds me of the /r/atheism gem of which being mocked by memes enlightened me.

&gt;I REALLY want to believe that I'm overreacting, or missing something about microsofts approach to the next gen system. But I honestly think this will be the biggest bust in gaming history. It's vital to get off on a strong note w customers, and they are literally pissing in the open arms of loyal xbox 360 owners who WANT their product.
&gt;As a very, very loyal xbox owner I am done. PC here I come.
&gt;Fuck you Microsoft.

This is really the most common reactionjerk to all this.  Even when people mention PS4, or WiiU god forbid, it invariably redirects to PC gaming master race.  I guess that is really a jerk across Reddit though.

 * [How is it legal? +60:](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ftls1/microsoft_confirms_xbox_one_to_perform_online/cadq7wt)

&gt;How is it legal for them to prevent you from playing a game you paid for for not having internet for 24 hours?
&gt;MS must have a really strong lobby in congress or something.

It must be **illegal** for them to not let us play games.  There are laws that state that we are entitled to play games.

To conclude I must note I am not good at typing these.  Theres something more I want to say, but I can't really seem to type it down.  But this time I felt the need to just vent and talk about this.  I'll really just disappointed with the entire gaming industry.  There is only one gaming journalist I respect, that would be Adam Sessler.  I just don't understand the fervor of the debate.

At this point, the EA hate is comical, but now the mouthbreathers of /r/Games have a personification of everything that they hate about EA: SimCity. The evil EA acquired Maxis and ruined them (i.e. got them to create one of the most popular franchises ever in the Sims) and has turned the eye of Sauron onto the gleaming jewel that was SimCity. It's laced with DRM, it has forced multiplayer, and the cities are too small. A greater nirvana could not have been imagined by the stalwart truth seekers of /r/Games and SimCity will be their call to arms to the rest of the community, eventually leading to EA's utter destruction. Except for one thing...

... if the early previews are to be believed, [SimCity is actually really](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/02/07/hands-on-simcity/) [fucking good.](http://www.pcgamer.com/previews/simcity-hands-on-clever-beautiful-and-terribly-terribly-addictive/)

But /r/Games can't have that, can they? So how do they explain two reputable sources that are absolutely glowing about the game? By making shit up. 

*As a quick info dump, it's common in the games industry to give journalists 5-8 hour previews with games before release. These aren't reviews and aren't meant to be; they are previews. They help drive hype and bring in traffic for the previewers. So off we go!*



&gt;It's my fear that this game is built for those first 6 hours.

Yes. Maxis built an entire game building up ***specifically for this one moment: so that the early previews of the game are glorious!***

&gt;Sorry, the idea of online-only single-player games is still abhorrent to me.

Oh. We jumped into the DRM stuff quite fast. But then we have someone that dares to counter the anti-DRM jerk and mentions that it's nice to hear something about the game other than said ranting!

&gt;Thank god /r/simcity changed or I would've never learned anything about the game other than ""EA bad, DRM bad, Origin bad, game garbage."" I've seen quite a few threads in /r/SimCity that had good discussions over gameplay, city efficiency, etc. It's actually the only place in all of reddit that has any meaningful discussion of what SimCity is as a game and what its features are.

But then /r/Games has to be /r/Games again.

&gt;A popular opinion doesn't have to be wrong. The DRM is bad and needs to be mentioned as much as possible, even if it's just to counter the marketing which intentionally downplays it.

DRM is so bad that we should probably talk about it in church, guys.

&gt;Sorry, but I believe you guys have to live with that inconvenience. It's simply an important point. It goes far beyond ""but everyone has internet, now"". 

&gt;I actually do. I see it being downplayed to much applause all the time because it's apparently ""annoying"" to see all this negativity. There plain aren't all that many things that can be discussed about a game. That PC Gamer preview didn't contain a single new piece of information for me. You'll see the same points being made over and over again because that's all there is to discuss.

What?

So he's saying that the fact that the previews are all talking about the things that they love about the game is proof that that's all there is to it? So it must be bad? And that DRM is terrible but people on /r/Games simply don't listen, hence why it has to be brought up? Maybe the reason there is an anti-anti-DRM jerk is because many of us really don't care too much about it. Yeah, it's a nuisance. But it's just a nuisance. 

&gt;This is the same PC Gamer that gave Dragon Age 2 a 94/100 score, right?
Pardon me if I take what they say with a grain of salt.

Ah, so now we have to attack the source, yes?

And here's my favorite quote of the thread...

&gt;There is no jerk. That kind of DRM is unnecessary, justified through questionable logic and has proven terribly inconvenient in the past (see Ubisoft). I'm sick of drama being generated as a self-fulfilling prophecy. I see almost more top level posts decrying the mention of DRM than DRM itself.

This is an /r/Games mod chiding a user for buying into the anti-anti-DRM jerk while also promoting the anti-DRM jerk. As such, it is the perfect personification of what's wrong with /r/Games. 

I'm sorry, but maybe if the gaming community as a whole was more anti-piracy instead of openly applauding it, DRM wouldn't have developed the way it did. As it stands, developers do lose money to pirated copies and this is their way of dealing with that. ""But Gaben said!"" blah blah blah. Newell isn't the only voice in the game industry and there are many just as influential as he is that disagree with his position. What's more, Valve operates uniquely in the industry, as they have a small staff that is funded by an online store, whereas companies like Activision, Ubisoft, EA, Square and the like are huge companies that have to operate on the margins, so piracy can cost jobs there. Meaning that Valve can afford to say things like ""the best way to combat piracy is to make better games"" and then spend 7 years making a single title. 

/r/Games is no longer useful. It's circlejerkness is now on par with /r/gaming but it's so wrapped in pretention that I find it even less palatable. Shame, because it was great for a bit.

The idea that individuals and groups should be forcibly deprived of their reproductive capacities is abhorrent in the extreme. Unfortunately, this seems to be a common viewpoint among quite a few redditors. [In this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10c0zc/what_are_some_things_that_most_people_assume_are/c6c79nv), it's exposed at its near-worst. Let's take a look.

The first thread post: 
&gt;I hear people say that they wish the government could sterilize people who shouldn't be parents without realizing that in fact, the U.S government can legally sterilize someone, they just don't anymore.

The post immediately under it, the post that sparked the whole thing: 
&gt;My ex's mother was pressured into sterilization by the state of california after her 8th child, they used custody of (some of) her children to seal the deal.

And so it begins!
&gt;In Ireland they would probably give her a prize and encourage her to have more :(

Because Ireland is the land of the drunk Catholifags, amirite!?

Queue Irish jokes:
&gt;I have a joke. What do you call an Irishman in your back yard? Paddy O'Furniture!

&gt;What do you call an Irishman in a suit? The defendant

But wait! There's oh so much more!

&gt;That is entirely too many kids.

So some of them should be taken hostage and used as leverage to have their mother sterilized? All questions of responsibility aside, that's a pretty horrible thing to do. 

&gt;Good for the state of California.

Yes, good for them. 

&gt;Is it wrong that I think that's awesome?

Yes it is. 

 &gt;  Lastly, is it ethical to systematically prohibit the right to procreation based on characteristics, and, if so, what characteristics is this ethically justifiable?
Yes. People with genetic diseases shouldn't be allowed to procreate.

Thank you for deciding that for everyone. Now let's go abuse some people who are disabled. 

Perhaps these enlightened neckbeards should read the stories of those who were forcefully sterilized for being ""feeble-minded"" and learn of the pain and humiliation they experienced. Perhaps they could then rethink their faux-provocative stance.

Immediately I saw ""Sagan"" and ""Apple"" and assumed it was a CJ post, but as it turns out this actually came from TIL. An interesting read in itself, but I was curious how the comments on this one might read.

Think about it: tech geeks attempt to pay tribute to someone, person gets upset and demands they stop, tech geeks poke harmless fun at person getting upset over a tribute, person gets so upset that they take tech geeks to court for libel and lose, tech geeks poke fun at the general absurdity of the situation. You plug literally any other two characters in there and reddit will come out in support of the tech geeks trying to have a little fun. But because these tech geeks worked for Apple and the person was the good and just Lord Sagan, reddit naturally does a 180.

How dare they? This site that revels in immature, off-color humor 24 hours a day is looking down its nose at you, Apple!

Except it's clearly stated that it was an internal code name amongst the company's programmers and that Apple never once tried to use Sagan's name for profit. But hey, fuck them right?

This accounts for about 75% of the comments in the thread. Never, *ever* pass on a good opportunity to discuss your Apple hate. Even when they do things you like

The coup de grâce of this one though has to be the host of downvoted comments dwelling at the bottom of the article.

1347391097.0,133,self.circlebroke,zq232,AskReddit determines the most important fact to educate everyone in the world on,AnalAsPubicTofu,156,23,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/zq232/askreddit_determines_the_most_important_fact_to/,"So I saw [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zpc7n/if_you_could_make_the_whole_world_aware_of_one/) and figured I would take a look. Educating every man, woman and child on the face of the planet is a powerful notion, and could change many things all over the world. I wonder what kind of thought-provoking discussion is OH RIGHT, DUMB AMERICANS ARE LITERALLY WORSE THAN HITLER. I forgot.

AskReddit assumes that ""the whole world"" means ""all the dumbasses I see on Facebook screencaps on Reddit."" So obviously, the most important thing to educate them about, as chosen by Reddit, is [what the word ""theory"" means in a scientific context](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zpc7n/if_you_could_make_the_whole_world_aware_of_one/c66k63h). Yes, out of everything you could tell every person on Earth, Reddit chooses to be pedantic over one word that ~~people~~ evil, stupid Christians may not know the full meaning of. Forget hunger, poverty, war, and anything else that education could help stop, no guys, we have to make sure that fundies don't use that ""evolution is only a theory"" argument. Way to make the world a better place. So brave.

So that was the top comment, and the second one wasn't [TOO](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zpc7n/if_you_could_make_the_whole_world_aware_of_one/c66ktuu) bad. I mean, cars are fairly common all over the world, and car-related deaths are tragic. Okay, so, this guy isn't a big-picture kind of person but at least he would be doing some good. Maybe this thread isn't so DAE INSECURE ABOUT THEIR PENIS?

Yes. Third top comment: [how to accurately determine how great your penis is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zpc7n/if_you_could_make_the_whole_world_aware_of_one/c66k17k) Something that everyone on the planet needs to know. Of course this is a joke, but it's pretty close to literal circlejerking. Also [Asians have small penises](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zpc7n/if_you_could_make_the_whole_world_aware_of_one/c66lr7l) hahahahaha never gets old.

Next up: [Vaccinations do not cause autism](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zpc7n/if_you_could_make_the_whole_world_aware_of_one/c66k6vz).

It would truly make the entire world a better place to let a few people know that it's okay to vaccinate their children.

Okay well, that's the worst of the storm NOPE, NO IT'S NOT. Now we have the mother of them all, the biggest circlejerk on askreddit. So big that I'm sure they would have to rent a football stadium for this to take place in real life, if only to hold all the semen.

Jesus Christ guys, we *know* the US spends a lot of money on war and has been making cuts to NASA's funding. We *know* that it would be great for us to all hold hands, quote Carl Sagan and blast off into space with the power of science. But, addressing the first comment in particular, people don't start wars because they think ""Well fuck space, let's spend all our money on killing people instead!"" Letting every person on the planet know how great life without war would be is not going to help a god damn thing. No one likes war (well okay, most people). And finally, that comment didn't even state a fact; the end of war doesn't mean the start of space colonization. It *could*, I guess, but it's not a guarantee.

Oh but wait, if we spent all our money on science, [there would be no more poor countries](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zpc7n/if_you_could_make_the_whole_world_aware_of_one/c66kpiy). Well I'm fucking sold, then. Dumbass.

And now, we wouldn't have a complete thread without [bashing organized religion](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zpc7n/if_you_could_make_the_whole_world_aware_of_one/c66kyho), would we? I don't need to go into any detail about this particular circlejerk, you guys have all seen it before. It pops up in half the AskReddit threads, which end up over here.

The 9th top reply to the OP is the first one that actually addresses a real issue with undereducation that afflicts many, many people in more places than just America.

&gt;Then my next thought was, ""Oh, shit. Are guys actually dumb and debased enough to come to this sad sack's rescue?"" What say you? Does this woman actually have a reasonable expectation that random dudes are going to swoop in and white knight for her?

Yeah, because the only reason anyone ever asks for help is a gender issue. 

&gt;Even if I was dating, I would never date a single mother, unless the man died and she was a widow or something. It says terrible things about the woman's character to have a baby with a man she doesn't intend to stay with, or who doesn't have the character to stay with her

That gem is an edit of OP after the many comments implying she merely wanted sex from him (a huge assumption to make based only on the biased viewpoint of the misogynist OP). To him, a single mother whose children's father is still alive obviously has some personality flaw that led him to leave (ignoring the fact that if this retarded fallacy was even correct, a personality flaw doesn't preclude anyone from being loved).

Redditors a very violent, envious, and generally judgmental bunch.  But you already knew that.


**Death to people who wear clothes that I think are ugly:**

If your pants don't make your ass look good, you should die.

&gt; Pajama Jeans. Those are NOT butt-flattering!

If you wear a loud graphic tee, you should die:

&gt; Ed Hardy shirts

If you stole a Redditor's lunch money in third grade, you should die:

&gt; Tapout T-shirts

along with Sagan-level bravery and a touch of homophobia:

&gt; This! I call them Tapettes, it infuriates them. (happens to be French-Canadian slang for ""faggot"", they're usually too dense to get it though and just feel insulted but they don't know why.)

**Death to those who consume media I don't like:**

Redditors talk about the Jersey Shore more than anyone else I know, but thank goodness they only torrent the show and don't actually buy the DVDs:

&gt; Jersey Shore, Seasons 1-5 DVDs...

The inevitable I-Hate-The-Ghetto jerk:

&gt; Nicki Minaj CDs

Don't you ever try to burn a book in front of Redditors, but killing readers of certain literature is A-OK:

&gt; Twilight   

...

&gt; 50 shades of grey Books.



**Death to those who own expensive things that I don't own.**

Your headphones are overpriced by 30%?  Your shoes are ugly?  Die in a fire:

&gt; Beats audio headphones. And crcocs

&gt; To the people who think their Dr. Dre headphones are good headphones.

&gt; Beats by Dre. Only people I know who own them are arseholes.

Do you own a new luxury car?  Death awaits.

&gt; Any car with integrated Facebook/Twitter/etc. built into the dashboard.

Or maybe a really big car?  Go die.

&gt; Hummer.

And last, I can't tell if this guy is serious:

I'm guessing only a small percentage of those that vote actually comment, and those are the older people tired of stuff like this that don't blindly upvote any le epic post that they see.

However I wake up from this dream to discover that reddit is still the cesspit of hate against Muslims it always was - the principle thread for this news is of course in the ~~delightful~~ scummy /r/worldnews

Followed by -
 
&gt;I'm glad that there are Moderate Muslims in the UK and in France 

with this link - http://imgur.com/s5PSzrg

and then

&gt;""Good to see some more cultural enrichment in Europe.""

The really annoying thing about this is that */r/worldnews hasn't learnt a thing* Usually when something like this happens, reddit (and the planet) goes crazy for a day or two, before settling down and realizing how incredibly racist and misguided they were (perhaps a second-option bias) However, we've had time, we've had the Muslim representatives disavowing the original stabbing, we've had the exponential rise in hate crimes against Muslims (there was a story on /r/worldnews not long ago about a guy who threw a grenade at a mosque as a 'reprisal') and yet the hate keeps flowing! 

There are some decent rebuttals in the thread, but are usually less upvoted or downvoted than the hateful ones.

This brings me to the comment which I think sums up /r/worldnews and is the link to the slightly exaggerated title

&gt;I grew up in La Defense in Paris and I am so sickened by this news. We can't just be sitting around and watch as they kill our people, especially our soldiers. Unlike them, I will NOT strap a bomb to my chest, but I will use Democracy and vote for Le Pen in the next elections. Call me racist if you want, but we've given these people too many chances already and enough is ENOUGH! +29

Notice the elegant use of 'they' and 'we,' separating 'us' and 'them', presumably Muslims and non-Muslim French citizens. More importantly, the poster states a desire to vote for Le Pen - who for the uninitiated leads the far-right  'Front National' Party [FN], who are considered fascists by many (hence the title) Its very interesting to note that the FN are led by the virulently anti-muslim, Marine Le Pen who is the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, a previous leader of the party who was openly anti-semetic and questioned the holocaust.

This is who reddit is endorsing. Reddit is not liberal when they upvote posts stating a desire to vote for the far-right

So this guy wants to start a business selling homemade hammocks. He says he 'just wants to test the waters to see if this will be a profitable endeavor', and by that I'm sure he means 'whip Reddit up in a mini-frenzy before opening a kickstarter' (which he plans to do, because he sure as hell isn't paying for it.)

I'm not sure what led him to land on the selling price of $30. He says the materials alone will cost $20. This really makes me question the kind of value this guy puts on his time. The U.S. minimum wage is $7.25. He needs to be making one hammock every 1 hour 20 minutes to keep up with the MINIMUM WAGE RATE (and that's forgetting other expenses).

Maybe it's a ploy to get people to click the orange arrow and he hasn't disclosed the real price. He says he just wants to 'test the waters' first:
&gt; 'If I get a good response and people like them, I'll bump a little. I want to build a strong base first.'

Yeah, except establishing a reputation for $30 hammocks and then bumping up the price by $20-$30 is the absolute quickest way to piss off your customer base and decimate all that goodwill you built up.

And if he doesn't answer a question poorly, he doesn't answer it at all. A user asks him a really simple question - where he plans on selling them and who his potential buyers are:
&gt; Where I plan on selling them is still up in the air. They will be made per order because they are customizable. Potential buyers would probably be outdoorsmen and hammock lovers alike.

Seriously? Hammock lovers buying hammocks? Get outta here! And not being able to name a single place you plan to sell your stuff? Camping store? Sunday market? The internet perhaps?

So there you have it. A guy with a decent idea, but a very poor understanding of promotion, pricing, competitive advantage and customer behaviour, who is in the process of creating a kickstarter for his project because he doesn't want to take any of that risk on himself.

Some.

You tell 'em, Duke. 

Here we witness the birth of something extra-special. We're probably going to be seeing this one for a looooong time.

It's almost as if CNN thinks a national tragedy has occurred or something and are rushing to report anything they can. That a news agency of any kind would fail to check every single tip it gets during a nation-wide panic is absolutely disgusting, if you ask me.

Besides, wasn't FOX-hate Reddit's favorite news-related circlejerk? Do we even have enough room for both?

Honestly; what are you looking for when you post a thread like this, other than a circlejerk of congratulations.  You haven't said anything new/original/enlightening to the centuries old discussion of the world beyond us.

The [first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/19y3x9/my_dad_is_a_street_preacher_my_brother_is_a/c8sdphw) is reasonable, and understandable from the most moderate of (ardent) atheists.  Choice quote:
&gt;Rationality is not going to get him out of those beliefs.

The rest of the comment is the similar atheist tone of rewarding *le* skeptics for all their intellectual capabilities.  The comment even admits that it cannot offer anything productive other than a congratulations for being so articulate (if your dad is smart, I'm sure he'll be convinced by your amazing rhetoric skills!!!)

The [second highest](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/19y3x9/my_dad_is_a_street_preacher_my_brother_is_a/c8sdcx6) upvoted comment, however, is just plain /r/atheism intellctual elitism bullshit

&gt;you may be according to your relatives a rationality that is simply not there.

Yes, these people who I have read one (incredibly biased) opinion piece on; I know these people lack the skills of rationality us atheists posses.  You can only try so hard to help people like this.

At least the [highest rated response](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/19y3x9/my_dad_is_a_street_preacher_my_brother_is_a/c8sfnxj) to this is reasonable.  Which is really my biggest problem with this subreddit.  I love theology/philosophy of religion, if it is handled by people who understand that we are talking about the translations of translations of oral traditions dating back thousands of years (whether they agree with it or not, and pretty much regardless of which religion you are talking about).  There are plenty of people who understand this on /r/trueatheism, but in order to get any traffic/views/appreciation of their posts they have to hijack and reply to implicitly ignorant and naive comments.  But even this response has 1/3 as many upvotes.

The [third biggest](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/19y3x9/my_dad_is_a_street_preacher_my_brother_is_a/c8sdvg3) comment.  I don't even want to talk about it.  Just read it.

I get that in the first place the dad is being an ignorant asshole, but, as two wrongs don't make a right, two ignorant assholes don't make a truth.  I don't personally believe in any God, but the extent to which Atheists, no matter how much they try to separate themselves from the core movement, are uneducated about religion actually appalls me.  When I first came to Reddit I loved /r/trueatheism because you could have intelligent discussion.  Now it is just the same Facebook posts we see on /r/atheism posturing as intellectual discussion.

The core thing that strikes me about Reddit/internet atheism in general is that it assumes biblical literalism is the only way to interpret the bible, when actually very few Christian groups are biblical literalists (in the truest sense) and most religious people alive today don't give two flying ducks a buckshot for the new testament.  And this thread reflects that, I suppose (slightly) justifiably as it is about a Christian parent v their atheist child, however, there is no actual understanding of any of the scientific principles OP talks about, just a general jerk about how brave the Atheist was to tell their oh so ignorant parent the truths of the world, but how their attempts to better their families lives will be met in vain, because they have already given themselves up to the evil of God (sounds like a very evangelical position to me, just with some words rearranged/added/changed because evangelical Atheism is **in no way** influenced by evangelical Christianity.  I swear)

TLDR; The typical Reddit atheist circle-jerk about how I am so much more intelligent than the straw men arguments I create about the religions I don't understand.

",odin_the_wanderer,203,70,249,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/11nncd/people_who_limit_their_sexual_behaviour_are_idiots/,"This post is actually from two different threads, but it's a circlejerk that just really, really gets under my skin. Basically, in the world of Reddit, if you aren't of the mindset that imposing any limitations on sex is stupid, and anyone who does is a moron. People on here just love to whine and complain about people ""shaming"" them for having sex, but in reality, coming from a rather conservative state (Texas), I've seen much, much, more of the reverse: people being viciously criticized and mocked for their decision to remain abstinent. I guess I'm confused how it's bad to shame someone for having sex a lot, but it's perfectly fine to ridicule someone who ends up not fulfilling their desire to remain abstinent. I'personally am asexual, and have no desire to ever have sex. I cannot tell you how many people, online and off, have lectured me about this. Can you /imagine/ the backlash if I lectured them on not having sex? (I don't.) ""ZOMG STOP OPPRESSING ME YOU FUNDIE BASTARD!!!"" I hate how Reddit's idea of liberation is merely the dissolution of self-control. I do love this quote from Aldous Huxley though:

""There are already certain American cities in which the number of divorces is equal to the number of marriages. In a few years, no doubt, marriage licenses will be sold like dog licenses, good for a period of twelve months, with no law against changing dogs or keeping more than one animal at a time. As political and economic freedom diminishes, sexual freedom tends compensatingly to increase. And the dictator (unless he needs cannon fodder and families with which to colonize empty or conquered territories) will do well to encourage that freedom. In conjunction with the freedom to daydream under the influence of dope and movies and the radio, it will help to reconcile his subjects to the servitude which is their fate.""

The thing is Redditors only tolerate people who don't want sex, or want to wait to have it if they're commited to being syncophantic morons. That is, ""AS A PERSON NOT HAVING SEX I FULLY SUPPORT YOUR RIGHT TO MAKE FUN OF AND BELITTLE MY LIFESTYLE CHOICES AND NOT HAVE ME OFFEND YOUR SENSIBILITIES BY DOING THE SAME TO YOU."" This isn't to dissimilar from what people have actually said. I got a PM from someone awhile back that said, ""You're free to not have sex (even though this decision is immature and ignorant) but stop thinking you have the right to police my body or shame people for expressing their sexuality."" What prompted this? I commented in a thread that about college or something, ""I have no interest in sex, college hasn't exactly been a 'blast' for me seeing as how most social get togethers center around it at least indirectly.""

Anyhow, let's get started:

&gt;[""Wait until you are married""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11mkd0/what_is_the_most_horrifyingly_wrong_or_incorrect/c6nqvfg)

Yep, because waiting until marriage is ""horrifyingly wrong and incorrect advice."" Even if you think pre-marital sex is fine, does that mean waiting until marriage is wrong? No, it means the information is incomplete. No one I know who is for non-abstinence sex ed believes we should ENCOURAGE kids to have sex. . .

-------

&gt;[Is the whole no sex before marriage a typical/common American thing? Because I've never once heard anyone give that advice to anyone in the UK.

Oh dear God, the circlejerk here, it hurts. Of course all of we here AmeriKKKans are just stupid inbred hicks.

&gt;[It's shocking to me that you've never heard that before. I'd say it's a pretty typical American thing, very popular with conservative Christians.

Nothing to say here other than I've had it with this stupid pattern of ""As a European, why are Americans so dumb?"" With the then inevitable self-hating idiots replying back ""ZOMG FUNDIES""


-------

&gt;[Well I mean I've heard it in terms of ""on the internet"" but I've never heard/known of a person in real life (in the UK) that had or would give that advice to their kids, or that has recieved that advice from parents. It's kind of an understanding that pretty much everyone will have sex before they marry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11mkd0/what_is_the_most_horrifyingly_wrong_or_incorrect/c6nrmhf)

-------

&gt;[Don't know a lot of people who waited, but I know a few. Don't know ANYBODY who didn't claim that waiting is better- it just didn't hold up once they started getting horny.

It's weird what picking and choosing your morals can do to a brain, in a culture where the rules contradict so much with what you really want. In the end she took a summer vacation away from me because she felt too tempted to have sex, but while she was away she started fucking her uncle behind her aunt's back.

You heard it here first, abstinence causes incest!


-------

&gt;[don't be melodramatic - no one is calling you a ""LOSER"" I don't know how old you are, I am curious about that... Anyway, while I won't call you a loser, I will say your perspective is very immature. Look Evan, at the end of the day it is 100% your choice to abstain from sex till marriage. However, a strong physical relationship is very often an integral part of a strong marriage. And guess what? You won't figure out sexual compatibility until you actually start having sex. A strong relationship has a number of integral characteristics. Physical intimacy, according to any study you read on what makes a good relationship, is one such characteristic. How you can jump into a lifelong commitment without knowing that you are a good fit is beyond me. Please don't tell me that you will magically be good together in the sack - trust me, we all make that assumption when we are madly in love with someone. However, sexual compatibility isn't determined what you do on the first day you start having sex with each other (or before that first day), its what you're doing several years into the relationship. of course, if you are asexual and your partner is asexual, then I completely take back all that I said :) really curious though - how old are you exactly? and why are you waiting?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11mkd0/what_is_the_most_horrifyingly_wrong_or_incorrect/c6nv6ir)

Well, now that that's done with let's travel to the other thread. Basically a woman says she's uncomfortable with her boyfriend going to a strip club, you can imagine the idiocy that follows. I'm not giving any commentary, because this whole thing is pretty exhausting, but you get the idea.



&gt;[I used to feel the same way. How could I be with anyone who went to a ""titty"" bar to gawk at naked ladies. Then I went to a strip club. Why dont you and your special someone head on over to the local club and check it out. It is actually a really sad place, unless you are boozed up, then it is beyond entertaining! I have now seen men and ladies strip it down for a crowd, they are just people who have a job. Sure, some places have the champaign room where you can indulge in extras, but it sounds like you are with a guy who wouldn't want that anyway. Figure out why you are uncomfortable with the strip club. Having a hang up like this is only going to make you upset. You can let these emotions go or find a partner that feels the same way that you do.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11mpz9/why_is_it_socially_acceptable_for_attached_men_to/c6nv6gi)


-------

&gt;[I get the feeling you've never been to a strip club. My suggestion is you go to one and see what it's actually like, most of them aren't all that bad. (And that doesn't mean searching porn sites for ""strip club footage"" because you're going to find a lot of shit that is not real strip clubs... You are going to find fantasy porn that pervs who spend all their money at the stripclub like to watch) If it's a strip bar (they serve alcohol), then they are not allowed to be fully nude (or at least it's like that where i'm from). Which makes it really come down to a regular bar, but there are topless girls serving the drinks. And jesus christ, if a stripper tried to put her ass anywhere near my face, I would get the fuck out of that place. If he says he's not getting a lapdance, he's probably not getting a lapdance. A lot of guys, including myself, are not really into lapdances. They are really expensive, and not all that entertaining. As the lapdancee, you know you're not getting any, you know you're not allowed to touch, and you know that the lapdancer also knows this, and they are only there because they want your money. Overall, it's a very impersonal experience.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11mpz9/why_is_it_socially_acceptable_for_attached_men_to/c6nuqlk)

-------

&gt;[Why wouldn't it be socially acceptable?
I honestly don't understand your perspective on this. At all.
Background on why:
I've only ever been in 2 committed relationships and both times the girl had cheated on me within 2 months. Every single other relationship that I've ever been in (including the girl I am with right now who I've been with for almost 2 years) have been open relationships. I have never cared who they did things with (as long as they weren't fat, unhygienic, gross, or I had a personal vendetta against them) and I have done things with others as well. We have done things with others as couples. The whole idea of being turned off because your partner was with another person is just ridiculous to me.
Furthermore can you honestly say that you don't look at/read porn? I see no difference between that and going to a strip club. Just have him shower first. Maybe my perspective is warped because I don't understand jealousy or commitment, or ever being grossed out because my partner did something with a beautiful man/woman but maybe you need to realize that it's just sex and it doesn't really matter as much as the love you hold for him.

&gt;[Why is it socially acceptable for attached women to show cleavage?
Edit: The comments below have produced the following answer: Cleavage is socially acceptable for attached women to show because it's not inherently sexual. I think this answer is quite applicable to the question of strip clubs, even though it may seem odd to say strip clubs aren't sexual.
I'd argue that going to a strip club is not an inherently sexual act when done in the context of a bachelor party. It's done as a tradition, and it's done in order to bond with friends in taboo man-centric environment one last time as a contrast to the equal gender environment of marriage.
I've been to strip clubs in this context, and while I can't speak for everyone, I can certainly say it was non-sexual for me. I wasn't aroused at all (in fact, strip clubs generally disgust me), and spent the entire time bullshitting with the other groomsmen and drinking. We left in under an hour. If we had wanted a sexual activity we would have gone to a local 'massage' parlour and got a round of rub &amp; tugs.
This of course does not apply if the man is visiting the strip club outside of bachelor parties, and by themselves.

&gt;[Because you and him both shouldn't be afraid of sexuality. Do you make him change the channel, or turn off the TV if breasts are shown? Also, do you constantly ask him if he finds other women more attractive than you? To me this sounds like a self confidence issue. He's going for a bachelor party, he's not just going to hang out at a strip club. Often in scenarios like this, there's a few guys that don't even particularly want to go there, they're going for their friend. He's going to see some naked girls, probably not for the first time. And he has less of a chance with making out with or sleeping with a stripper than he has of picking up any random girl anywhere else to cheat on you with. Chill out. TL:DR Sometimes people get naked. And regardless of how attractive you are, there's someone somewhere else better looking than you.

Of the image posts, *only three of the nine* contain gore of **any** kind, and all of them do make one stop and mutter ""what the fuck..."", be it for the [sheer](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/i6q1e/he_sat_like_this_the_entire_class_period/) [absurdity](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/i21nq/worm_guy/), [incredible](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/rrm4v/18_wheelers_flying_through_the_air_in_a_tornado/) [nature](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/m8of9/til_%E0%B2%A0_%E0%B2%A0/), or [just](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/qox2b/one_of_those_things_that_i_thought_was_a_plant_is/) [plain](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/q3pf9/a_wonderful_story_for_children/) [oddness](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/9e157/microsoft_poland_spot_the_difference/).

The links are all to things that are incredible enough to make one say ""what the fuck"", with the exception of the [top link of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ac9l8/paybacks_a_bitch_the_big_music_companies_are/). This one ties in hand in hand with the pro-piracy attitude on reddit, and was probably the reason the mods banned political or call-to-action posts. The videos are much the same, with much more gore, including murders, severe injury, and good old police brutality (I'll leave you to imagine the comment threads on [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/gqu1l/nypd_gives_guy_a_ticket_for_riding_his_bike_on/) [links](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/i4ocf/officer_with_a_well_known_history_of_violence/)). There are only eight videos on the top page, and only three contain no gore. The ones that are goreless are patently absurd, so they fit as well.

Overall, with the exception of the top link of all time, that's 24/25 good, on topic, and truly WTF-inducing posts.

Let's take a look at the [Hot page as of August 24, 2012 9:33 am EST](http://i.imgur.com/8dXvJ.png). The first thing that sticks out? **Every post is an image post**.

That's not a good sign to open things up, but let's break it down. Eight of the top twenty-five hot are gore posts, and, not surprisingly, only *one* is labelled as such. Another seven of those posts are rather inane, really. They range from a [modern art display](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypizu/i_know_im_not_a_student_of_art_and_i_know_its/), to a [picture of Conan's head on a My Little Pony body](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypmg3/my_little_cony/), to [someone's medical bill](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/yqgu1/my_wtf_i_received_in_the_mail_spent_only_8_hours/) (because fuck the rules on post with political connotations), to a [wedding picture whose only shred of a tie to WTFness being something a bartender purportedly said about the picture](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/yq7tv/my_bartender_asked_me_if_i_was_in_a_wedding_with/), and [someone bending their thumb the wrong way](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/yqv2k/look_close/).

Of the remaining ten pictures, you can divide them up between ""I'm easily scared, and I found this scary, so give me karma"" ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypzql/dog_just_dug_this_up_needless_to_say_it_scared/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypv38/got_my_hands_on_a_bbw/)), ""I'm easily offended, so give me karma"" ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypett/someone_spray_painted_a_squirrel_at_the_local_park/)), and legitimate WTF-inducing posts ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/yqli3/my_friend_has_brain_cancer_and_this_is_the/), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/yq2fh/this_popped_up_on_my_news_feed_nsfw/) NSFW, [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypbhg/what_the_fuck_kind_of_sex_tips_are_magazines/), [4](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypl1s/local_craigslist_ad_with_the_title_mustang_lovers/) NSFW, [5](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/yq3nk/veggie_man/), [6](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/yp72r/i_googled_pc_case_mods/), [7](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypcn9/all_i_can_think_is_balls/) NSFW).

Now, I haven't linked to any gore threads yet, and I'm not going to, so if you've been avoiding those links, I promise, they're not going to make you puke.

Now, bear with me for one more run. Let's take a look at /new on /r/WTF. I know it's not really fair to judge the page as an indicator of content as a whole, since a *lot* of terrible posts get downvoted to oblivion then and there, but let's look around at 9:59 am EST for good-quality WTF posts. [This is the page, images closed](http://i.imgur.com/la4Fk.png).

I count eight decent-quality image links that abide by the rules of the subreddit (nine if you allow the MURRIKKKA FUCK YEAH coloring book one). There are two news stories about the shooting in New York City, one bitching about Armstrong getting his wins revoked because drugs, one about a porn star admitting to using faulty STD tests knowingly, one about pet food, one about a music video, and one about a FurBQ in New Jersey. Overall, I'd say that the /new page has roughly ten/eleven good-quality posts and I was very surprised that not all of them are image posts (16/25 is a pretty decent record, actually). Still, ten/eleven on /new lines up pretty well with fifteen/sixteen of /hot being decent.

It's sad, really. /r/WTF used to be a pretty interesting place to browse, and was good for that *I'm so fucking bored, I guess I'll scroll through every page ever"" feeling. It *might* have a slim chance of being saved, but only drastic measures can do it at this point in time. Maybe if the mods remove it from defaults. Regardless, /r/WTF has one foot in the defaultcesspool grave.

Why not flash mob that embassy dressed up as Julian?""

No, seriously. That's their idea. You can see for yourself [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yga1n/hey_brits_i_keep_hearing_about_julian_assange/)

So the juiciness usually ramps up in the comments so lets go!

Oh an interesting question

&gt;And seriously the guy might be a rapist. Why shouldn't he face the legal system of Sweden?
&gt;&gt;ell if he goes to Sweden, it is likely he will be immediately extradited to the US to face charges of treason and espionage in front of what has been widely accepted to become a facade of a just trial. 

Widely accepted. You heard it heard it on reddit first. Of course there's no source or anything, but by gawd a redditor told me there's no just trial in the U.S.

&gt;As an Australian, I am disgusted by my governments lack of support for this crusader of free speech. (Sorry for the essay, but I feel the mainstream media has painted an unjust picture.) 

Le crusader, and le rapist!

&gt;An international law expert said theoretically a hundred people in disguises could enter the embassy and Assange could exit with them disguised as one of them when they all left and the police would not have the power to arrest any of them.

An international law expert? I'm convinced. Let me go get myself tased to protect a rapist!

&gt;As we are british we do no such thing, we sit back in our chairs and tut. Similarly we might pop to the Winchester and wait for all of this to blow over

Hah! British people are sophisticated!

&gt;Do police use tazers in our country now?

Le pigs have weapons to protect themsleves. Fucking assholes.

&gt;The problem is, once he goes to Sweden, he will then be taken to the USA to face treason charges which may result in the death penalty.

Completely unfounded conspiracy? Check. Implicit denial of sexual assault? Check.

&gt;I actually laughed out loud when I read this. Have you heard of David Hicks? And nobody cares what he's charged with, only whether he's charged, extradited, and possibly disappeared.

The U.S. would just you know make him disappear, but they can't do that until they go through with getting him to Sweden and starting up extradition proceedings...... you know which is much easier than just nabbing him in Ecuador.

&gt;Since 2001 these laws are essentially worthless with regard to the US. If we need someone, we simply demand that the local authorities hand them over or in some cases kidnap them. Hell, we were (and may still be) running secret prisons right in Europe. You think these human rights laws apply? All bets are off when America starts blabbing on about national security. 

Yeah, we just kidnap people. Again though we really need to get him to Sweden for no apparent reason.

&gt;In your honest opinion. Do you think this rape allegation has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with wikileaks and extradition to the US?

In your honest opinion can you really disagree with my conspiracy theory?

&gt;He isn't being charged with rape. In fact, even the two women he supposedly raped haven't pressed charges. The police interpreted their concerns as ""yep, definitely rape"" and decided to charge him regardless of what the women said.

Oh they only said it was sexual assault. That means nothing actually happened. Silly women, probably friendzoners.

&gt;just make assange black, no one will think its him, boom case closed. Source: As a German we had to deal with getting high party members into south amerika while under the watchful allied eyes.

Something about making Assange black or something.

&gt;This works under the assumption that he will receive a fair trial, these people aren't being fair, they're doing all this when he hasn't even been charged with a crime, if he ends up in a court, they are going to bury him, i wouldn't be surprised to see him convicted of rape and put away for the maximum possible time, and if they don't manage to pull that one off, he can simply be sent to the US, either directly or not, send him back to Australia, they will hand him over like its nothing. As for being shipped to Guantanamo, you're probably right, he may not go there, but look at Bradley Manning, they will put him away somewhere, and there are plenty of holes in America for a man to spend years of his life rotting away.

Nothing but some AmeriKKKa jerking here.

Finally I'll leave you with this nugget even though it's downvoted since we've decided to go full on tinfoil hat and rape denial.

&gt;I think that Julian assange didn't rape or sexually abuse anyone. I think that this is a set up because he has classified information or because he has revealed classified information. I reckon that the US givernment has influenced certain other governments and are trying to catch him for whatever reason's. Look at the Australian government, they go help fucken drugos in Asia but they wont try to help Julian Assange. The Australian government is shit, it's right up the American governments arse.

However, on /r/wtf there is [this post](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1anvg2/i_work_in_it_and_i_just_found_this_gold_mine_on/) in which an IT worker finds some weird drawings done on an employee's computer.

&gt; Sorry to be that guy, but isn't this a serious breach of ethics on OP's part? You took somebody elses files and publicized them?

It saves having information spread out in a hundred places and drowning out other topics. As far as I'm aware, /r/games haven't tried doing that before.

The liveblog that the /r/games mod is providing is pretty rubbish. I thought that was to be expected - they're not a professional journalist or writer, they're just a volunteer mod. I liveblogged a Nintendo Direct for /r/nintendo once and honestly halfway through I was fed up and just wanted to watch it. That was half an hour. I'm writing this /r/circlebroke post **two hours** into the Sony conference and it's **still going**.

So, I think it's fair for people to critique the liveblog and hope for better next time. I think the entitlement on display is disgusting. Here's some choice quotes, bold emphasis added by me:

&gt;Regardless of the comments in the thread, why is the OP posting such terrible info?
&gt;
&gt;""Some new Killbone game or something""
&gt;
&gt;""Second Son game announced. Super hero something or another""
If this is the only thread allowed for the PS4 event, can we at least have someone posting decent updates? This is **ridiculous**.
&gt;
&gt;EDIT: Looks like OP has changed. Still not impressed. **Totally unprofessional and unfair.** You don't allow people to post their own threads, and **treat this thread like a joke and its readers like idiots. Unsubbed.**

&gt;Every place has one guy who spits in people's food. **This mod is that guy**.

&gt;For real, this is pathetic. I don't want uptight professionalism but at least make an effort. Since this is a mod post I'm **definitely unsubbing**.

Again, there's room for critique of the way the liveblog was done, but there were so many professional resources that were even linked to in the original post that it didn't matter at all.

The demands requested of mods are unreasonable and punishing. It's hard work and unrewarding. And this incident is further proof that the Reddit userbase at large are childish, entitled brats.

Anyways, I don't know if anyone else has noticed this one yet, but this morning on r/music the top post (1089 upvotes strong) is [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/15k0t0/i_gotta_admit_my_hate/) daring declaration of hatred against, no joke, ""Physically disabled kids trying to sing pop songs.""

&gt;Come on internet, you know fully well that these people are physically disabled, they are not ""beautiful"", they are not ""singing like angels"". Just stop, you know its not true, i know its not true, and so does everybody else.

I can't really tell if this statement is trying to imply that being physically disabled and being beautiful or singing like an angel are mutually exclusive, but that's certainly how it comes off. I guess he's also ignoring the idea that the enjoyment of music is subjective and that lyrics and emotional content can often be more important than the quality of the singing specifically (otherwise how can you explain artists like Bob Dylan?). So even assuming that all of these videos to which he alludes have bad singing, it's still possible that people enjoy them anyway for their musical expression, or lyrics, or whatever. 

Luckily, many of the top voted comments do call him out on his somewhat douchy sentiments, but many of the replies that follow them attempt (rather badly) to explain why disabled children *are* evil. As a result, this:

&gt;I can't believe something as unimportant as giving strangers imaginary internet points bothers you this much.

gets chased by this: 

&gt;It always surprises me when people think that this is about 'imaginary internet points'. Do you know how many thousands of dollars advertisers pay for 'imaginary internet points'? Do you have any idea how much revenue can be generated simply by getting people's attention? I'm guessing not, because you're calling it 'imaginary'. It's only imaginary to people who don't know how to leverage it - well, there are many hundreds of people who do know how to leverage it, for whom YT views translate to cold hard cash and yes, even reddit karma can be worth money if you know where and how to shop it. It's not quite so obvious that the average schmo can do it, but trust me, there's nothing 'imaginary' about the power of getting thousands of people to look at something.

I'm not one hundred percent sure how this relates to the topic. The idea that youtube likes can translate into advertising revenue isn't exactly new, so I have no idea why a kid singing a song she wrote should be worth any less than anything else on youtube.

scrolling on down...

&gt;People aren't supporting them because they are good at it. It's not pandering, it's compassion. It's that despite their difficulties they are trying to express themselves in a creative and positive way. That you would be offended by their popularity is an indication of your immaturity, insecurity and indifference.

A little bit ablist, but their heart is in the right place. Then this jackass has to jump in:

&gt;I'm sorry, but the majority of these ""I have cancer and here is my goodbye song"" songs are shit. Anyone that's listened to any kind of skilled music can admit that. Random acoustic guitar wankery and sad lyrics aren't creative, they're cliché beyond belief. There is no other kind of guitar music that's as cliché as a sad acoustic song.

Oh great, we have a self-proclaimed music expert here to testify to the inherent inferiority of these songs (incidentally, people who try to claim that the music they like is inherently superior to the music that they don't like piss me off quite a bit as well). He seems to have unironically ignored the point of the first commenter, that there's no reason to be offended by music you don't like. This comment goes on for a while and makes some other silly points, but I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise.

There is, of course, a lot more where that comes from. So I guess the question I would leave you with is this: why the hell do these redditors care so much about this issue? What about this issue pisses them off so much? Is it the perceived hypocrasy of people liking ""bad"" music? have their own shitty music videos not done as well on youtube?

I hope you all already have your 3D glasses on because the euphoria of that last sentence is practically coming out of the screen. First of all, the thread OP linked to isn't a poll but rather a thread looking for feedback about the new changes. Secondly, 36 hours notice would not lead to a fair poll. Lastly, OP is invoking one of atheists' favourite debating tools in the form of an ad populum logical fallacy. Just because the majority of people think something is true, that doesn't make it objectively true. If people voted evolution out of schools by the same margin and followed it up by saying ""you can't tell us you're better at science than us"", r/Atheism would go into meltdown.

Okay, maybe that was a one-off. It's not like people think voting out of the blue holds up in any way as a valid argument... right?

""Satire is how to change people's minds.""

www.np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fy4zp/satire_is_how_to_change_peoples_minds/

&gt; I only began to question my religion once I heard people making jokes about it on TV and at school. Comedy and satire are the way to change people's minds since you need to get them to question their beliefs. It may sound absurd to atheists not brought up in religious households but most people never question their beliefs because they are surrounded by people who don't either. Seeing a funny meme about something stupid in a religion begins the process of getting people to question their beliefs. I only knew about the other insane things Leviticus says (like the not mixing threads etc.) via memes I, like many others, was never going to read Leviticus myself and these short sharp jokes are quick and easy to repeat and spread easily.

This person is so free-thinking and rational that s/he gets his/her arguments from incredibly watered-down memes and jokes. OP confesses to regurgatating other people's arguments because s/he couldn't be bothered going through the effort of forming his/her own opinion. I hope this person doesn't come across an image macro of ""Fucking magnets, how do they work?"" lest this person honestly thinks ""Oh yeah, that is absurd. Thus magnets cannot real Q.E.D.""

Finally, we examine this shiny nugget of a quote:

&gt; “Ridicule is the only weapon which can be used against unintelligible propositions..."" - Thomas Jefferson [+298 karma]

Because if Thomas Jefferson said it, it MUST be true...

And so, the Great Civil War of r/Atheism rages on - for freedom, for equality and for crappy memes!",,False,,t5_2tnz9,1370799050.0,,,True,t3_1fz34w,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1fz34w/ratheism_and_irony_or_logical_fallacies_are/,

Now heres a jerk that, while not HARMFUL to anyone, is still quite sad and laughable. 


Basically OP posts a meme detailing her unfair treatment for reading a book out of her reading level, fair enough, it is ridiculous to punish a child for attempting to read a book that may or may not be too advanced, and its even more ridiculous still to punish them for reading it successfully and writing a report. 


Where it gets downright stupid is when all these redditors come out of the woodwork to wave their reading aptitude results around.


&gt;I sort of had the opposite problem in grade school - I always tested into a reading level of at least twice my actual grade (in fifth grade I tested as reading at almost a 12th grade level). My teachers told my parents I should start reading the Wall Street Journal. Really? Luckily my parents just gave my teacher a funny look and bought me more horse books.


Cool, I guess it isn't out of the question that some-


&gt;Yeah, I had college level in 5th grade. High vocabulary and I could read extremely fast while maintaining comprehension. Reading class was the most annoying thing in existence.


Oh what are the odds that two people in the same thread-

&gt;Once I discovered real novels in 6th grade my reading level was far too advanced for school. My reading teacher said I was at least 12 grade reading level and I was reading stuff like Stephen King by that point. Read them because I wasn't allowed to see the movies. haha I was too smart for my own good.


Oh are you kidding me? How in the hell is Stephen King considered a book thats at a 12th grade level?


&gt;My English teacher in 11th grade gave an exam at the beginning of the year on everything that we were required to know at the end of the year, so the whole purpose of the test was for everyone to fail it. I got 99/100 at the beginning of the year and when she re-issued the test I got 94/100. Her class literally made me dumber and she managed to give me a D for the year. At the time I was writing papers for my boyfriends English 200 class and getting A's on them.
I also took the reading test that gauges what your reading level was. Ours went by 100s so every 100 was a grade level, but it would have weird middle numbers like 1034. I scored a 1400 (which was ""above college level"") and she made me take it 3 times because she thought I was cheating. Scored the same thing over and over again. (pissed her off to no end).

I'm gonna go ahead and call bullshit on this.

This thread is littered with comments like these, and while they clearly do not make up the majority of comments I'm sure everyone is aware of these common assertions being made everywhere. Whether it be casually mentioning how you were deemed ""gifted"" in kindergarten, or dropping your 160+ IQ into a conversation; Redditors are still suffering from what I like to call the ""Nobility Delusion.""


Basically I think this stems from the victorian class/caste system, just bear with my pedestrian reading of Marx for a moment, I think most redditors, and probably most PEOPLE, believe that being BORN smart is more important than becoming a well read/intelligent person over time. To most people who grew up in a society that has it's roots in a class system it would be more appealing to be born a genius (or born a Noble for the sake of analogy) than to have become one. 


To your common redditor, who hasn't finished College, probably wasn't ranked too well in High School, had an average SAT score, having been identified as 'gifted' or exceptional at an early age makes up for these feelings of inferiority. 

So why is this more prevalent on Reddit than it is in real life? Since most people are average, why don't people in the real world begin every conversation with a mention of how high their IQ scores are?

Well I think this has to do with two things

1: Reddit values intelligence more than other traits, in any sub, in any discussion on reddit intelligence is valued. This is probably the logical result of reddit being a discussion site where interesting discussion is valued. 


2: Having high intelligence as an inherent trait give credibility to the excuse of ""I'd do it if I weren't so lazy."" Once they've established that they were born with a superior intelligence they can instantly continue to feel superior to everyone. Oh a rocket scientist disagrees with me? Well thats not a big deal, I could have done what he does if I wanted to, I mean check out how talented I was when I was 5. 


For all of it's posturing about being a liberal place where Lockean ideals matter Reddit sure does give a lot of credit to having an innate intelligence. ",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_1fjnwq,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1fjnwq/i_guess_everyone_had_a_postsecondary_reading/,

&gt;Reposts also have an advantage- people already having seen them, can vote on them that much quicker.

What he missed is that reposts have more going on in the background rather then people just upvoting them because they have already seen them. Let's explore this idea of why and how stereotypes/familiar content effect every redditor.

______

**Why Reddit Loves to Hate Things**

Reddit loves to hate things. A small list of the most recent popular ""hated"" topics include:

* Islam
* Mitt Romney
* Yolo
* EA
* Women in a Divorce
* Americians
* Christians
* Pro-life people
* TSA
* Republicians

I could go on for a while longer about things reddit ""hates"". The thing that ties these all together is that reddit loves to hate (and by hate, I mean upvote to carl sagan's cosmos) anything portraying these “hated” things in a negative light. Some notable examples are threads such as [this one applauding a group of teens that died](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/zkbd3/i_was_told_you_guys_might_enjoy_this_cross_post/), [this thread attacking the TSA for existing](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/xszxo/its_time_we_told_congress_to_replace_the_entire/), and [this a thread comparing believing in religion to being drunk](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/10iqya/religion_is_no_different_than_being_drunk/). There are plenty more examples to find. A good place to start looking would be the top submissions category for each medium to large subreddit.

Now, reddit constantly says that they hate Mitt Romney, the term Yolo, EA (literally Hitler), Christians, and Republicians. So why do posts like these often hit the frontpage/get many more upvotes compared to others submissions? It is because of the positive or negative response tied to the hivemind's stereotype of the word. Let us use the term Yolo as an example.

Yolo is a polarizing word inside of the hivemind's opinion. Anything tied with the word yolo is to be [mocked](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/10050l/you_did_not_just_bring_yolo_into_this/), [attacked](http://www.reddit.com/r/reactiongifs/comments/tuc5b/when_my_friends_told_me_they_were_getting_yolo/), or [applauded](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/10dnfb/these_two_started_out_the_night_by_yelling_yolo/). Why does this happen you may ask? It is because the hivemind that inhabits reddit has a built in response to key words such as yolo. Here is an example using the term yolo:

&gt; These two started out the night by yelling ""YOLO!""

The keywords ""started the night"" sets the setting. From there the title continues on to "" yelling YOLO!"". The point of those two words is to get you to love to hate the post. You hate the people in the post because they yelled yolo. You don't know the people, and you never will. Of course though, you hate them with all your heart. The hivemind is captured by this use of words because they are so recognizable/familiar. It is a commonly accepted stereotype on reddit that the term yolo is ""bad"". Therefore people are willing to auto-upvote the [image of two young girls sitting depressed in their own puke](http://i.imgur.com/E7SMK.jpg) without feeling even a glimmer of sadness for the obviously regrettable experience. 

**People want to upvote things that go with the hivemind.** It gives them a sense of community and a sense of ""I know what is right! DEBATE ME!"" That is why anti-islam xenophobic posts are so common right now. That is also why /r/atheism and /r/politics have such a predictable circlejerk. 

_____________________

**The Reddit Beast**

The reddit beast is the predictably irrational hivemind that influences everything in the reddit universe. According to science/economics we should be able to predict the trends, decisions, and thought of the hivemind because the reddit beast is supposed to be ""rational"". Sadly, one thing we all know about humans is that *we are not always ""rational""*. Usually emotions and feelings will cloud our (and therefore the hivemind's) ability to make the ""correct"", trends/decisions/thoughts. The reason why the reddit beast exists is because we like to have a community of like-minded opinions. We still remain predictable while in the hivemind (hence the ability to use the same key words/stereotypes again and again), but we also continue to be irrational (hence the ability to use constantly negative stereotypes to get upvotes).

The reddit beast likes these stereotypes as they tell them what to believe. Contrary to reddit's belief, people like to be told what to believe (at least they like to be suggested rather forcibly. see /r/atheism for evidence). Conventional wisdom/rationality says that no human being would support a completely emotion based title to a post (see ~~/r/revengeporn~~ err.. I mean /r/justiceporn to see emotion based commenting and voting), but thanks to the predictable irrationality that inhabits the reddit beast we can guess pretty accurately what they will upvote. Generally anything with highly provocative/emotional topics such as anything having to do with sex, religion, fads, politics, companies, money, or opinions is bound to get upvotes if the title is correctly worded.

To correctly title a submission/comment, you must paint the subject you are using in a positive or negative light based on the subject. Take [this example](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/10dws1/christian_right_wing_group_focus_on_the_family/): 

The title of this submission: 

&gt; Christian right wing group 'Focus on the Family' Humiliated by Al Franken

Key words desired to create a love-to-hate effect:

* Christian
* right wing
* humiliated

The entire submission's title was created to inspire the hivemind to upvote without thought. Two negative ""love-to-hate"" words are prominently displayed in the title. To encourage you to quickly create an emotion based decision included is the ""call to action"" key-word ""humiliated"" which makes you feel like you won something.

With 1,971 positive, we can safely say that the reddit beast was *predictably irrational*.

_____________________

**Why We Tame The Beast**

Reddit's hivemind wants to love-to-hate things. People want to have stereotypes because stereotypes are productive at making predictable emotional responses easy to upvote or downvote. No matter how much the hivemind may deny it, a large part of the score/popularity of submissions on reddit are based on the emotions and stereotypes of reddit. People use these stereotypes to create comments and submissions that will collect upvotes. Sadly these stereotypical comments and submissions that rise to the top often are low effort, or incredibly shallow.

Effectively, the reddit beast has tamed itself into using stereotypes to choose it's content. Not the idealistic rational so much of reddit claims to use.
__________________________________________________

Reddit will likely continue this trend into the future. With older stereotypes being stomped out, and new ones being brought into the hivemind's collection. We've seen bursts of rapid stereotype change (see [genetics based dragon sex mmo](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p1ssv/dear_internet_im_a_26_year_old_lady_whos_been/) from /r/gaming for an example), but for as long as we have the flawed ranking algorithm we have today, there is little chance we will be able to fight this irrational, emotion driven hivemind voting. 

On a good note, now that you know how to tame the reddit beast, I expect each of you to get to the top of /r/atheism or /r/politics by tomorrow.

**TL;DR** Reddit loves to use it's own predictable irrationality to use emotion loaded/stereotypical topics to shoot low-effort/derogatory/spiteful comments/submissions to the top. You can guess what will get to the top by knowing what the hivemind likes to upvote/is familiar with.

What bothers me is how these jackasses have to jam their beliefs down everyone's throats.  It seems like you can't read any thread on reddit without some token ""religion sure is dumb, durr"" comment.  What bothers me more is the ""well I'll probably get downvoted"" pretense, acting like he's willing to bravely stand up for his beliefs instead of posting a pandering comment for reddit.  Seriously, has anyone every gotten downvoted for making an atheist comment on Reddit?

Normally, I'm able to just brush these off and ignore them, but for some reason this really got to me.  I think it's the support of the replies, and their support of OPs narrow-minded view that religious people can't be intelligent.  OP says he can't believe intelligent people believe in religion, so of course the top replies are all about how religious people aren't really intelligent, they're just book smart.  It's your typical atheist circlejerk about how if you don't agree with us, you're not really smart, even if you are by objective measurements.

It's some low-hanging fruit, but this particular comment got bestof'd, and even the people in the [bestof thread](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/19p6pq/seductivemango_gives_a_great_soup_analogy_for_why/) can tell it's shitty. So I feel a little justified in complaining about it since, rather humorously, this post is within the top 10 of /r/all and the comments for it are talking about how terrible it is.

[This](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19o0na/sim_city_is_a_complex_game_and_deserves_a/c8q1w1x) is the comment in question. Now if this isn't upvotable material, I don't know what is. Soup and gaming at the same time? Well, butter my knickers and smack me with a garden hose because this is some grade-A wall-banging fist-pumping soup-eating terrible-analogy-making Redditsauce.

First I want to point out the hilarious offset between the comments on both threads. 

I won't get into too much detail but suffice to say the top 5 comment threads on the /r/bestof link unilaterally agree that the analogy is bad, whereas the top 5 threads below the comment in question in /r/Games all unilaterally agree that the analogy is awesome and here's more analogy and let's continue making analogies DAE EA is basically selling us soup but being really condescending about it? Wouldn't you buy free soup instead? *Analogy.*

The comment proper is too long to quote here concisely, but again, it's [here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19o0na/sim_city_is_a_complex_game_and_deserves_a/c8q1w1x) if you want to skim it real quick -- there's not much to it. Fairly typical ELI5-style explanation that seems clever because it uses narrative devices to explain an abstract concept how creative and original.

So I'll start with the most blatant direct reply.

&gt;[And then comes your friend, Stephen. Stephen is a disgruntled customer as well. He loves the soup just as much as you and decides that he can make a batch just as well as the restaurant. [...] Now, instead of going to a poorly run restaurant, you can get a helping from Stephen for free.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19o0na/sim_city_is_a_complex_game_and_deserves_a/c8q3pth)

You can see how this analogy has already fallen apart and changed subjects. But more importantly, the implication that a customer is justified in pirating a game because ""Hey, if it were *soup*..."" is pretty funny to see codified in comment form.

&gt;[Sadly your friend, Tess, is gluten intolerent and the restaurant and Stephen both put noodles in their soup so she can't eat them. So she decides to also make her own recipie so she can make soup at home but she does not want other people to have to redo the work she has already done so she gives out the recipie to anyone who wants to use it as long as they share what changes and additions they make.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19o0na/sim_city_is_a_complex_game_and_deserves_a/c8q4bzr)

This is sitting at (13|0) right now but what the hell does it even mean

&gt;[Your friend Stephen who has been a loyal customer for many years is finally getting annoyed of the stricter and stricter rules. He sneaks in the kitchen and takes a copy of the recipe, nothing has been stolen but he does now have the ability to supply his own copy of the soup.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19o0na/sim_city_is_a_complex_game_and_deserves_a/c8q4ple)

The ""nothing has been stolen"" made me laugh out loud. This particular reply is hideously long and has its own narrative about how HEY YOU'VE CHANGED THE RECIPE AND THIS IS _ILLEGAL_. Plus this vaunted ""Stephen"" guy sounds like a douche.

I just want to point out that if this scenario ever were to occur in real life, Stephen would be legally on the hook for a ton of money and perhaps jail time assuming the recipe was a trade secret, so this analogy also falls apart. I'm seeing a pattern here.

Let's move on to the more blatant piracy-is-good jerk that you knew was coming.

&gt;[If a game you purchase ever works against you to such a degree, I would definitely suggest obtaining a cracked version of the game. There should be no moral objection to this, but if someone disagrees I would love to hear their take on it. TLDR: Support the developers and buy the game, but download and use the ""pirated"" version, instead.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19o0na/sim_city_is_a_complex_game_and_deserves_a/c8q51hz)

True. Absolutely true. Because if my restaurant has the audacity to require a periodically-checked membership card, for example, I am morally justified in stealing the recipe and making the restaurant's soup at home. I hereby submit that my sarcastic analogy is better than yours.

Just a quick aside, I actually agree with his TLDR. If you bought the game, I don't see a moral problem with using a cracked version so that you can play it.

Apparently the rest of Reddit doesn't...

&gt;[DON'T support the developers and buy the game, doing so will just encourage them to do the same thing again, you bought the game, they assume you agree with the model. DO NOT buy that which you do not agree with. Simply don't play the game, or if you feel like you must, pirate it, because often pirated games that have DRM offer better services](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19o0na/sim_city_is_a_complex_game_and_deserves_a/c8q5amo)

Hahaha no they don't. But I like the implication that developers and publishers are incapable of just listening to people and their only method of communication with the outside world is their sales figures.

Someone points out that the publishers are the ""guilty"" parties here and the developers will be hurt by piracy, only to be roundly defeated by this paragon of wisdom:

&gt;[No, they're not, they're using publishers like bands use ticketmaster. [...] They do not get absolution, they get piracy till they smarten up.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19o0na/sim_city_is_a_complex_game_and_deserves_a/c8q6fji)

There was a post on CB a few months ago where someone actually argued that piracy is a kind of political speech. Someone find that post and compare usernames with this guy. (Don't really.)

But wait, here's another Reddit analogy!

&gt;[I completely disagree with your premise. It's like saying, if your dog takes a shit on the floor, reward him with a cookie and clean up after him so you can enjoy your nice house. If someone does something bad/shitty, you don't reward them for it. That's just bad parenting.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19o0na/sim_city_is_a_complex_game_and_deserves_a/c8q5gzp)

You heard it here first: buying games with intrusive DRM makes you a bad parent.

I don't think I can top that.

&gt;Have sex with all of them, just to get the curiosity factor out of the way. Then drive 'em off a cliff and jump off at the last second. This way you won't get in trouble for the ""accident"" and none of them could ever complain about you later. Job security.

So we have ELI5, a nice little sub that has grown in popularity. A nice setup for having complex ideas explained in layman's terms so your average Joe can get a grasp of a concept.

However, it appears that much like AskReddit, it has become a bastion of bravery, an echo chamber in which to pronounce to Reddit how euphoric you are. The Mods are currently leaving comment graveyards in their wake, but I fear they can only remain vigilant for so long. Let us examine some current submissions.

Mmmm right off the bat you can tell this is directed at Obama and the current political situation and directly going against the rule of ""overly loaded questions"". Some answers are quite commendable but they quickly go into bickering. Let's not linger too much.

&gt;I, personally (Danish) have only had a bible in my hotel room once or twice in my entire life, and if I remember correctly I was out of country.

Top comment, with 547 points: 

&gt;I've seen more videos of real explosions in this last month than I have seen overall in my life on the internet.

Alright. So, the top comment is not about the Syrian civil war; it is not about the specific events under discussion; it is about the redditor themselves. This is understandable, but it's also a bit nauseating that such a narcissistic comment is at the top.

Then, a little further down, we have this, standing at 83 points at the time of writing:

&gt;Why did that happen? Sorry, I don't know much about politics and events, who made the explosion? Does no one know yet? How many people died? Who are you?

OK, so they don't have a full grasp of events in Syria. This is fair enough, I suppose, but then take a look at his other comments:

&gt;FUCK ISRAEL. I don't hate jews but I don't care what your religion is, you push someone out of their homeland and make them look like the bad guys, you are fucked up in my eyes.

&gt;Are you shitting me? Look how far you've pushed them. The jews are the ones who started it. Were they living there when the kingdom of israel was there? No? THEN IT'S NOT THEIR HOMELAND.
As far as the palestinians know they've lived there their whole lives and suddenly the jew show up and claim it. There was a kingdom of israel long ago huh? Well whenever the fuck that was it's over, you stupid fucking jackass. The palestinians are living there and suddenly the jews show up and tell them to leave.
That's like a native american showing up at your house that you paid for and saying its his because of what happened in the past. Also, the palestinians didn't rape and kill the jews and get them out, THEY WERE ALREADY THERE.

&gt;FUCKING NIGGER LOVER FUCK FIGHT ME BITCH
In all seriousness though, I don't hate jews. I just hate war and capitalism. Why can't we smoke weed and get along? #love #peace #socialism #yolo

So, despite his professed ignorance of ""politics and events"", they feel perfectly capable of making judgements about the Arab-Israeli conflict. I feel that this attitude is all too common on Reddit (and, admittedly, in real life): ""I know Sweet FA about this, but here's my opinion anyway."" (Also, I may be taking things a bit too far, but hating ""war and capitalism"" easily transforms into hating Jews.)

Then we have /u/Sprengstoff with this comment:

&gt;So hypothetically, If i lived in syria and this shit was going on. would i be able to like you know.. leave?

Fair enough. Further down, though, they say this:

&gt;wow that fucking sucks. We barely hear about syria here in canada.

This is bullshit. I'm in Australia, and CBC has some great coverage of Syria. Thankfully, he gets called out for this:

&gt;What? Literally every half hour on CBC News this morning they had updates from Syria, both reporters in Jerusalem and Damascus. And it runs every day on the National. Not to mention I see reports on Global and CTV with fair frequency.

&gt;Yeah there's plenty of coverage of Syria in Canada, I think it's more likely Sprengstoff just hasn't been paying attention (which is fine, but making it sound like the Canadian media really dropped the ball on this one is unnecessary).

&gt;Eh, it's the Reddit way. Every day you see people claiming either incompetence or conspiracy to cover up a story by the mainstream media. I usually google the story for grins and find a half dozen articles about it. I think the moral of the story is if you aren't happy with the quality of news you're seeing, please go find better outlets and reward those who are doing real work.

&gt;Sometimes you just have to listen a little harder...

I'm not quite sure if I'm expressing what I think is going here properly, but I think it goes something like this: ""I'm uninformed about a world event. But I can't be responsible - it must be the lamestream media!""

Further down, we have an excellent comment from /u/sultayne, providing some context. It turns out that they are a Syrian and they are about to travel to a refugee camp to help out. This prompts this charming comment:

&gt;...until Israel comes and bombs your schools, playgrounds and then they will say ""the government fired rockets from the school playground into israel so they need to be eliminated"".

Admittedly, it's standing at -1 point, but it often seems to be me that some Redditors can't get over ISRAEL MAN FUCK THEM RIGHT. I'm using this comment as a bit of a strawman for what I think is a wider problem, I'll admit. But it feels to me like the only reason that Redditors harp on about Israel is because it's one of the few international issues they actually know about. They want to appear knowledgeable, worldly and empathetic, but they don't put any effort into it. Speaking of which:

Fuck the lamestream media, amirite? I can't decide if this an attempt at a political circlejerk, a desperate desire to feel superior or an attempt to excuse ignorance of major events. Maybe all three. But hey, who needs the news when you have Reddit and The Daily Show?

&gt;There is absolutely no comparison between the way people lived in Syria and how things are in Saudi Arabia. I spent a good amount of time there as a kid and to this day people from there still think highly of the Assads. It was also the most Christian-friendly country in the middle east before this shit started going down, but that's long gone.
edit for clarification: I stayed in Syria.

So, an outsider's opinion of Syria gets highly up voted. It's fairly obviously wrong (some Syrians think highly of Assad, others - like anyone with family in Hama in 1982 - hate him. You can't make generalisations like that about a country as divided as Syria). However, it's a contrarian statement, and so it gets up votes. Below, there is a reply from an actual Syrian:

&gt;You're right, he is spoken highly of, but as a Syrian citizen, I have to inform you that the reason we have portraits of the Assads all over the place, from restaurant windows to taxi cab rear-view mirrors, and the reason we speak highly of them, is not respect. It's because if you're seen or heard speaking against them, you're likely to get imprisoned or killed. Sure, some people might actually support them, but definitely not a whole lot.
I've spent several years in Syria overall, living with my enormous extended family. At first, whenever I spoke against Assad, they would hush me up immediately and cover up my mistake, even if it was on the balcony of their own apartment, or within our own car with the windows down. It's fear, not respect.
It's what finally spurred this war. If he was so thought of so highly, why were there so many protests at first? And why did he begin firing on peaceful protestors and on funeral processions? In the end, my uncle was recognized as a leader of one of the peaceful protests and was seized in the night two years ago, just before the actual fighting began. We haven't heard from him since and have no idea what has happened to him. Also, his apartment was held by Assad's secret service for months and cleared out before they abandoned it.
And you're right, it was very Christian friendly before, and I only hope it somehow remains so after this is all over. As much as I loved my country even under Assad, you have to understand that it's because of how uninvolved his government was. Nothing really ever happened domestically. I once asked my my aunt (grew up in Syria, but studied in Germany and is a practicing doctor who had her office burned down by Assad's secret service for treating wounded women and children near the start of it all) about the court system in Syria and she laughed and said that nobody in our family has ever had any experience with it. I'm only 22 and live in the U.S. and I've already been to court here at least a dozen times.

Essentially, OP has a child that gets enticed by DLC (Downloadable Content). OP wants to teach the child the value of money, and that paying for DLC in a game that is rarely played is spending money that could be used for more fun.

Cue the Redditors - Champions of arguing against the premise of a question without a shred of intention to ever answer it.

The top comment may not answer the question, but it explains why OP's child might want the DLC so badly. However, its [only reply](http://np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dgyps/to_parents_using_rgames_how_do_you_explain_to/c9q8gbu?context=3) calls out OP for wanting to educate the child on an important life lesson. Good job!

&gt;[My cousin asked me why I didn't buy the DLC for most of the Call of Duty Games.
ergo, I gave him a teddy bear without the eyes, he complained that this doesn't have eyes. I said the eyes will cost you extra, but at least you can still play with the bear.
and I told him, THAT is what DLC is.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dgyps/to_parents_using_rgames_how_do_you_explain_to/c9q7771)

This is my 2nd favourite comment in the thread. I'm not sure what makes it. Perhaps the pretentious, nonsensical use of ""ergo"". Maybe the fact that it has nothing to do with the question. It could even be the image of sheer tween nerdrage it conjures up. This of course brings up a debate on horrible analogies for DLC. It's worth noting that this comment has 42 children out of 85 comments made on the page.

Another says, [Don't. I have a child over twice the age of yours and he seems to get it](http://np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1dgyps/to_parents_using_rgames_how_do_you_explain_to/c9q8rts). OP's child must be slow or something...

I really don't understand what this guy thinks the implications of the question are. The reading comprehension skills are through the floor.

You'll see it all the time in any thread with a picture or description of a pig. This is commonly dubbed the ""bacon circlejerk,"" and is doubtlessly one of the most aggravating on the internet, Reddit included. The problem with this circlejerk (other than the fact that it's completely devoid of content) is that it's consistently among the most thoughtless. See, unlike a thread in which Redditors post offensive content and attempt to justify it, the bacon circlejerk requires no forethought of any sort. This brand of comedy is a staple of unclever teenagers and really isn't exclusive to Reddit. It's not hard to imagine a group of kids wandering around the zoo, pointing out each baby animal of which they'd like to get a taste. There's no intellectual content in a comment like that, and it gets old pretty quickly. It's puerile humor to be sure, but I begrudge them their jokes. I've heard worse, and I've heard more offensive.

My concern, then, is that on Reddit, it's impossible to avoid. Unlike in real life, where a joke can only be repeated once before it gets old, it takes little to no effort to post a two-worded reply to a picture insinuating that the commenter sees the subject as little more than a meal. There's no give-and-take, only a one-sided, snide remark. Whereas a typical circlejerk might appear in this format:

     -Boy, Christianity sure is stupid, isn't it?
    
        -It sure is. Check out this meme I made.
            
            -Man, that is so true.

                -I know, stupid dumb fundies.

The bacon circlejerk will instead appear in this format:

      -Mmmm, can't wait to chop this little guy up and eat him.

      -Yummy yummy in my tummy.

      -I could never be vegetarian. Bacon is just too tasty and delicious.

      -Pigs are cute, but bacon is cuter!

It just never ends. It's everywhere, and it's unavoidable. Maybe it's my fault. I should know better than to visit the comments section of r/aww expected a real, genuine discussion. The subject matter in that subreddit is particularly conducive to circlejerks anyway, since there's not usually much to remark on. Mostly personal anecdotes and compliments and the like. Today, though, I was curious enough about the animal in question and the locale that I decided to poke through the comments section hoping for a little more information. That was a mistake.

And that brings us to today's subject, [a newborn bison at Yellowstone](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1dc6pb/newborn_baby_bison_at_yellowstone_national_park/). Our lowest common denominator here is a bison burger, so that's what will be in the comments. Lo and behold, there's almost nothing but. Without further ado, I give you a small sample of the bacon circlerk (or in this case, burger circlejerk) that shows up in the thread in question. 

&gt;now i want a bison burger..

Keep in mind, I'm writing this as of 217 comments in the thread. Not only that, but I've only posted some of the responses here. There are plenty more in the thread if you're so inclined to suffer through more of them. All in all, these comments constitute a good quarter of the thread's comments section, not that I should be surprised.

Now, just looking through those comments (if you made it through them), I'm sure you've noticed that many seem to be quite similar. No, not similar. *Identical*. These comments—which are, in fact, duplicated verbatim—seem to indicate that the authors of these remarks didn't even bother to look inside the thread in which they're posting. And here is my problem. It's not that this circlejerk is annoying (which it is) or that I don't care for the content (which I don't); it's that this circlejerk is so utterly anti-content that it's hard to even approach the thread without being bombarded with exactly the same comment. I'm inclined not to bother wading through it in the first place.

Now, fortunately the comments I really came for—the ones about Yellowstone—are located towards the top of the thread while the bacon circlejerk tends to wallow at the bottom (though not exclusively). Also, in the interest of fairness, there *is* one comment that attempts to address the bacon circlejerk much more concisely than the essay I'm writing for you all:

&gt;We get it. You guys love talking about how it will be delicious. That is not what /r/aww is about. Please stfu.

And that's really all this is about.

Here is [the thread in question](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/13mdev/this_made_my_blood_boil/). now, we all know that ratheists act like assholes, but now they are conjuring up reasons to justify their actions. 

now, without further a-do, here is the bravest comment i have ever seen:
&gt; Why [should we be nice to non-believers and treat them with respect]? So they could spread incorrect information?
Listen, I know it feels good to say it, but it's not true. The most rapid rise in atheism in history coincides with the New Atheist movement, wherein vitriolic attacks on religion became mainstream. Thousands attribute their deconversions to Christopher Hitchens and his unrelenting speech against religion.
You want to know how to eliminate religion? Ridicule. It's the most effective idea-shaping tool since we discovered language.

""the most effective idea-shaping tool since we discovered language"", wow, all i can say is wow. also his use of ""vitriolic"" is amusing as well, i dont know if any of you guys have read any of Dawkins, Dennet, Hitchens, or Harris' material, but it is possibly the worst and most pathetic excuse for ""philosophy"" i have ever seen in my entire life. i mean, Dawkins, for example, attempts to critique the [Ontological Argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument#Anselm) in his book ""The God Delusion"" and not only is it apparent that he has never ever ever ever ever read anything by St. Anselm, he obviously doesn't understand Anselm's use and meaning of the term ""greatness"" or the fact that nobody uses this argument anymore because of [Kants Critique that was presented fucking forever ago](http://www.existence-of-god.com/ontological-objections.html). I mean, Dawkins even presents this critique in his book and this doesn't dawn on him. so, being far from ""vitriolic"", its really just dead horse beating combined with teenage angst. And i haven't even gotten started on Dawkins ""central argument"" which would leave anyone who knows what a syllogism is speechless, and should be submitted to the hall of fame for hilarity. 

If any of these idiots who claim that the Four Horsemen are the most ""vitriolic"" movement against religion actually spoke with an *actual Ph.D holder* in philosophy, they would realize that most things they say is complete balderdash. i mean shoot, just mossy on over to /r/philosophy and they would tell you the exact same thing. If you want to read good Philosophy, stay away from the Four. 

moving on: here is another gem made by super awesome atheist polemist __DELETED__ in response to someone saying essentially the same thing [i said](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/13mdev/this_made_my_blood_boil/c75b8vz), but has more upgoats:
&gt; I appreciate your kind-hearted approach to promoting atheism, but I am missing where anyone has been sufficiently rude here as to require censure...(insert boring diatribe here)...
Again, definitely welcome and encourage you to take the path of positive focus on science. Happy to be on the same team, if not on the same line!

im really scratching my head now, the poster seems to be confused with what he believes in terms of good ways to promote atheism. first he's saying that we need to ridicule them, and mock them (akin to [St. Dawkins legendary speech to his fellow Dawkinites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPqqp8KVuQU)) and that NOTHING ELSE WILL WORK to get the holy message of Hitchens to those stupid fundies, but now he's sympathizing with a fellow atheist who wants to be nice to people. Wow. 

i have got to say that this is a lot less jerky than most posts here on CB but i think it still brings up a valid point. ratheists/Dawkinites are really so smug that they feel like they have the **right** and have a **moral obligation** to be a dick to people. FOR THE GLORY!!!!! 

a side note, this thread is full of other lovely soundbites of smugness, this one is my favorite:

But the outcry is so cliché: name calling, revenge schemes, banhammer swinging and hating a person really hardcore because they are told to do so.

Dear Reddit,

You can oppose something without going rampant. You can stay calm and criticize. But you have to keep the reality in your minds. /u/violentacrez wasn't some choirboy and played with fire until he burned himself. This is a case of the spirits that you've cited.

I also oppose the methods how the shutdown happened, but it happened and the way it happened unfurtonately is the only way it could've been possible since Violentacrez and POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS manage to unite a crowd of creeps that in no way thought their sexuality might be going out of hands and of people denying any form of personal right.

It ended 5 hours later, luckily no one was hurt.  But, here is where it gets sickening.  Someone looked up the hostages facebook page and linked it on the /r/pittsburgh post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/108uwn/emergency_crews_respond_to_possible_hostage/).  Someone submits the post to [r/bestof here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1092zw/not_a_hipster_gives_us_link_to_hostage_takers/).  The best of post has since been removed.  

Conclusion of story [here](http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/local/emergency-crews-respond-possible-hostage-situation/nSG9k/)

This is just plain old creepy and a very very bad idea.  The hostage taker was still posting updates to Facebook.  Friends and family were telling the man to give up, but then the internet invaded.  This got linked around the web, so not all of the posts on his Facebook page were strictly from reddit.

Someone told the hostage taker to poop out the window, not sure if he was from reddit or not, but I don't believe he was.

Here is a blurb from a news article about it:
&gt;Initially, police wanted the Facebook page kept open, hoping to gain useful information, but they later asked Facebook to take it down so that Thaxton could focus on communicating with authorities.

&gt;The Facebook exchanges had the potential to both help and harm those efforts, said Police Chief Nathan Harper. It was helpful that Thaxton could see ""that people are concerned about his well-being,"" the chief said, but ""it is a distraction for negotiating.""

&gt;Hours into the standoff, Pittsburgh's public safety director, Michael Huss, asked the media to refrain from reporting about the Facebook page, though many outlets had already done so.

I'm walking a fine line here, for several reasons:

1. It regards a very sick, adorable little girl.

2. There is a subreddit specifically for this: /r/getwell. 

3. I don't like this post.

How could I possibly be bothered by this? Well for one, I don't think any 7-year-old has only one birthday wish: 100 cards from anonymous strangers. I think she'd prefer one Barbie instead, or whatever little girls play with these days. I think the OP hopes to delight the girl with 100 cards as a surprise.

&gt;She has only asked for cards for her birthday

From her friends and family, I assume. Many people request this. It's incredibly mature of a seven-year-old girl. Sounds like she didn't ask for 100 though, which would negate the selflessness of the request, and transform it into something greedy. I think we're getting to the truth: mom or dad want to reward their little angel's modest wish with a blockbuster number of cards. Upon reflection, this is very understandable, if annoyingly posted to the wrong sub, perhaps in an attempt to get more views and thus more cards.

&gt;What does she want on her pizza? [+308]

Faith in Reddit: restored.

&gt;How about we donate to a CF-related cause in her name instead of buying her 1000 pizzas? 

Or how about we donate instead of sending her 100 cards? Maybe she'll like receiving 100 cards from us mouth-breathing neckbeards, but it's not what she asked for, nor is it in the spirit of her request. But yes, donating to a relevant charity is an excellent idea.

&gt;Apologies for the shameless plug but you should check out /r/getwell. I'm sure there're folks over there who would be glad to help too.

A very polite way of redirecting the OP to a more suitable sub. Someone cracks a joke that he must be Canadian for apologising for something shameless.

We started on thick ice with a polite redirect to the relevant sub, we've now taken a turn into snarky internet land. Pull this one back from the gulley, Reddit. We're talking about a sweet 7-year-old cystic fibrosis patient here.

And **BOOM!** First we had the Yin: a polite redirect, followed by a checklist to call out a tired old joke; now we must suffer the Yang: snarky re-direct, followed by a checklist calling out the OP, who is presumably one of the tragically unwell girls' parents or family.

And just like that, a family's love for a sick little girl is reduced to a formula. Here's the thing: if you don't like these posts being upvoted, blame the upvoters, not the OP. This isn't a jaded sitcom writer using the same old recipe for stale laughs. Each OP is different. The common person is not the OP, it's the upvoters. They are the ones to direct your reductive checklist towards. 

This OP really should have posted to /r/getwell, but their heart was in the right place, even if they missed their mark. *They asked for cards for a sick young girl, for Heaven's sake.* The checklist conveniently leaves this last part out, replacing it with ""[**x**] Thought you guys may like it"".

&gt;/r/Favors 

&gt;/r/pics is a place to share interesting pictures and there is nothing interesting about this picture. This picture is being used as a thumbnail or way of getting attention for something that has nothing to do with a picture or photograph. You are also soliciting upvotes with ""Lets blow that wish out of the water Reddit"" which is against the rules here. These types of sob story submissions need to go and I cannot believe that they are still allowed to be posted on the internet's most popular image board that, in spite of these terrible submissions, is growing at an amazing pace. 

I think the girl's photo has ~~*something*~~ everything to do with the request. And he hit the nail on the head by saying 'most **popular** image board', instead of 'best'. Pic + sob story posts exist because they gain *popularity*. That same argument could be used against cat pics, or photos of retro gaming technology, or most other things on Reddit.

And he requested cards, not upvotes. Second time that's been conveniently omitted.

And just to prove that Reddit has no bottom, this next one smashes the bedrock and reaches Earth's very core:

What makes this worse than the previous one? Because it comes **FROM A NOVELTY ACCOUNT**, [sob_story_checklist](http://www.reddit.com/user/sob_story_checklist). Bravery has a new champion. I checked their history, they post this list on people who submit photos of their friends, family, and pets who have recently passed away. There's no novelty account for calling out Canadian sorry jokes, or redundant cat pic posts, or any other of Reddit's many circlejerk favourites ([**x**] Snowden good, [**x**]Obama bad, [**x**] science is fucking cool). Instead, we are honoured to have a courageous truth-teller who reduces the love of parents of children with a [median predicted age of survival in the mid-30s](http://www.cff.org/aboutcf/faqs/) down to a formulaic trope.

&gt;This is a great thing, thanks for posting OP! I'm having my company (~50 employees) sign a card for her.

Most recently, /b/ or /pol/ decided to invade /r/atheism with a fake Richard Dawkin quote which said 

&gt;Faith is harder to shake than knowledge

since /r/atheism is full of people who overcame the mind control of their theist parents, they of course ate it up and it was most likely removed by a mod.

The OP image of the first thread was posted to /r/circlebroke in a self post and it was removed due to it not discussing, complaining or being smugger than the rest of reddit about trends on reddit.

Here are some of the posts which take part of the circlejerk of saying Hitler did nothing wrong.

&gt;I think it's sad that people can't see the validity of a quote just because someone awful said it. If Osama bin laden had said ""Save the children they are our future"" i swear we would be putting toddlers to death for some reason.

Reddit is now taking media sensationalism to a whole new level, in a way that news aggregators like Reddit (and Facebook, Twitter, Digg, etc.) do: Badly.

**The motivations**

I'm a Reddit cynic and think that /r/karmaconspiracy is probably right a lot more of the time than you would think. But this line in the /r/news [update thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1cnwms/mods_removed_thread_live_updates_of_boston/) (after complaining about the mods deleting the previous one) really got me:

&gt; Note to MODS: Don't touch this thread. News and info is needed to keep people safe. Sit behind your computers with all the power you want...but I won't let people die because you are entitled.

Firstly, what?

Secondly, the vast majority of the news coming out of those epic news threads is not about public safety. If it was, they should solely be repeating official warnings (e.g. about the University or about areas to stay away from), not anything other than that. Nada. Half of the posts were about the status of the officers involved, their current movements or reposting photos of the bombers.

If anyone has a compelling argument for these news threads on the basis of public safety, I would love to be proved wrong. But those threads are currently filled with people on their scanners, posting unhelpful things like:

&gt; EDIT 3:21 EST: Sounds like shots being fired! My fault, 2nd stream played a video with shots

Great.

**The information is wrong**

A far more pressing issue is this: The information Redditors post is not only massively sensationalised, it's often wrong. The feeds they pull information from, from police scanners to on-the-scene pseudo-reporters or CNN 'insiders', is often so wildly speculative it actively harms the pursuit of justice as well as the individuals affected.

Reddit took it to the next level by getting their information from completely unverifiable sources, like police scanners. Getting such raw information is only bad, especially when it gets pursued in the way those 'leads' were. The wrong people get targeted by the internet, and the plague that will come on their houses will be unimaginable.

Need more evidence? Look no further than [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/findbostonbombers/comments/1co7kp/mod_note_despite_what_was_allegedly_overheard_on/) thread:

&gt; I'd like to extend the deepest apologies to the family of Sunil Tripathi for any part we may have had in relaying what has turned out to be faulty information. We cannot begin to know what you're going through and for that we are truly sorry. Several users, twitter users, and other sources had heard him identified as the suspect and believed it to be confirmed. We were mistaken.

This is case in point, straight up and down plain evidence for Reddit staying the hell away from investigating. For a userbase that spends so much time decrying the woes of victims of false rape accusations, they are *awfully* quick to accuse others of what is a much more serious crime. The consequences for those individuals may well be felt for a very long time, and that was only really because they caught it before it got too out of control.

From [this news article](http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/sunil-tripathi-missing-student-wrongly-identified-as-boston-marathon-bombing-suspect-356334):

&gt; Sunil, they said, ""has been struggling with depression since he took a leave of absence from Brown last year. A note suggestive of suicidal intent left behind in his apartment has his family extremely worried."" His father, Akhil Tripathi, runs a software firm in Pennsylvania. 

But it was even worse because police had to take time out of their day to deal with this shit. Time they could actually be spending combing through the hours of footage they have to, you know, find the bombers? Oh no, much better to have them deploying their resources to pick up your mess.

The police had to issue further PSAs to shut down the internet information spewing, like [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Boston_Police/status/325230546928160768). 

The reality is that if the police have something they want people to help with, they will ask the people. And those people probably won't be the subscribers to /r/news.

Finally, there's the victims to consider. Because yes, while attacks on such public events are, to a point, crimes against the whole country, they are, at their heart, crimes against individuals. Those individuals will not only see the workings of the sausage factory, they will have their stories exploited for karma, TV ratings and ad hits.

The incessant search for 'truth', done under the guise of 'safety' or 'justice', is the worst possible move for respectfully covering those crimes and doing what's best for either 'safety' or 'justice'. If you have *actual* information, don't report it on Reddit: Give it straight to the authorities. If you have wild speculation, don't post it: Keep it to yourself.

**What should happen**

A very long time ago now, it seems, I read [this](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/12/the-media-needs-to-stop-inspiring-copycat-murders-heres-how/266439/) article on the Newtown shootings. For those who don't read it, it contends the following:

&gt; As a sociologist, I am increasingly concerned that the tornado of media coverage that swirls around each such mass killing, and the acute interest in the identity and characteristics of the shooter -- as well as the detailed and sensationalist reporting of the killer's steps just before and during the shootings -- may be creating a vicious cycle of copycat effects similar to those found in teen and other suicides. 

I actually think the best approach would be for the police to release very frequent and very comprehensive fact sheets as soon as events like this happen, but with some key omissions (in line with the above article): They should *not* publish the names of suspects or the process of investigation, should *not* publish the specifics of the means of attach (such as a virtual DIY of how to make a bomb), and should *not* release the names of victims (at least, perhaps, until the family has consented).

Media organisations should take point in shutting down speculation (ala that Newsroom episode), and emphasising that people are innocent before they are proven guilty. Important public safety announcements, such as reporting suspicious behaviour or bags, should be key, especially in the area around the attack. The threat will come from new attacks, not the old ones already being investigated.

&gt;Did we not learn anything in Prohibition? Drug money is fueling the gangs. Take away that drug money by legalizing drugs, and the gangs then become much less attractive to kids. [link](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/17k5k0/15yearold_girl_who_performed_at_inaguration_shot/c869253)

Now, what does [the article](http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/01/29/15-year-old-girl-shot-and-killed-in-kenwood-neighborhood-park/) actually say?

&gt;“We hardly … have any crime. There’s been a few break-ins over the past two years since we’ve been here, but nothing that’s ever caused alarm,” she said.

&gt;Police said Hadiya had no gang affiliation and likely wasn’t the intended target. 

&gt;CBS 2′s Suzanne Le Mignot reports the park where Hadiya was shot is just blocks from King College Prep High School — where she was an honor student, volleyball player, and majorette with the school band.

---------

Whoops. The article never says anything about the victim's gang membership. It, in fact, mentions that she had *no* gang affiliation. There's not even the slightest mention of drugs -- not marijuana, crack, heroin, or any of the other urban blights /r/politics is very, very concerned with.

So, what is reddit concerned with?

I'll try to bring a bit more flavour, with this exotic journey into the heart of the scientist realms. With more than 70.000 subscribers, [/r/math](http://ww.reddit.com/r/math/) is the third largest scientific subreddit, and the largest non-default subreddit among them. Large attendance, low moderation: everything is in place to create a wonderful circlejerk. 

But what kind of circlejerk are we talking about? Mostly, you will see, upvoted low-quality content, and a few ideas which ooze through each thread. Their common point is that they convey flattery of the average user of this subreddit. In other words, the greatest common divisor becomes what set them apart from the more mundane folks wandering elsewhere. The true nature of a circlejerk. Due to the nature of the subreddit, we won't avoid some amount of technical considerations. I'll do my best to keep them as low as possible.

To give you a sense of scale, most of the threads are between 0 and 10 Karma, about one in five reach the +20 mark, and about one in ten goes up to +100 or beyond. The best submissions are between +600 and +1300.

Disclaimer: the circlejerk which does exist in /r/math does not prevent sensible comments, as there are also a few decent subscribers there (I have a reputation to hold). Sometimes the most upvoted comments provide a surprising but refreshing break from an onanism-centered thread.


**Most upvoted threads**

We want to see which ideas are the more upvoted; let's start with a look at the [best threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/top/). An alarm immediatly sounds in the head of any savvy reader of CircleBroke: while most of the submissions are self-posts, the top features 18 images (including comics and memes) and 2 YouTube links among the 25 first results. Easy to eat but bad for health. Now, look closer. What *ideas* are the most upvoted?

* ~~People are stupid~~ I am more clever than other people (or the machine): [[1]](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/os7xi/this_is_one_of_the_reasons_i_hate_doing_homework/) (+1295), [[7]](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/t2pxq/what_can_we_do_about_these_pervasive_bad_math/) (+874), [[8]](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/h89n7/i_teach_calculus_i_in_one_of_the_top_universities/) (+869);

The first point is the hallmark of any good circlejerk: autocongratulation. Yes, we are better than ""them"" - whatever ""them"" means! Yes, we are awesome! The two following points are more subtle, but more interesting. They deserve their own presentation.


**The Greatest Common Divisor**

From the FAQ:

&gt; As the sidebar on the reddit says, the reddit is intended for mathematical topics. [...] The posts in /r/math/ tend to be mostly about topics at an undergraduate level [...].

This explains the predominance of low-level subjects: trigonometry, as shown previously, but also prime numbers, equations and curves, and low-level manipulation of complex numbers (Euler's identity) are favorites. I am not familiar with the American curriculum, but their common point is to be high-school or college freshman level. 

One of the features which distinguishes mathematics from the other sciences is that it is often extremely hard to explain research-level subjects to people who do not have already a very good grasp on the problem, let alone undergraduates. Hence, it is not surprinsing to see very few current problems on /r/math: most of it is at best from the XIXth century. This is not a problem *per se*. We can't expect everybody to be a full-fledged professor, and it is a good thing that people can speak of mathematics whatever their skills are. What distinguishes /r/math is the lack of awareness of this fact.

You can critic [/r/physics](http://fr.reddit.com/r/physics) all you want, but it regularly features advances in physics and graduate-level subjects - relativity, quantum mechanics, etc. The folk in /r/math seems joyfully oblivious of the larger picture. I now present you two gold mines from two weeks ago (alas, they were worse at their beginning; they have been somewhat tamed):

[What is your most loved area in mathematics and why?](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/) (+91)

[Your most hated topic in mathematics](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/120pg0/your_most_hated_topic_in_mathematics/) (+68)

You will learn that [topology](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/c6rqjr8) (+41) is a whole area of mathematics, and that [computing determinants](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/120pg0/your_most_hated_topic_in_mathematics/c6rak73) (+16) and [matrices](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/120pg0/your_most_hated_topic_in_mathematics/c6r9sql) (+13) are valid topics in mathematics. They are not: they are tools, or at worse a source of grim exercises for college teaching assistants. And that is why they appear in this list: these people have little idea of what actual mathematics problem are, so they answer to what they have studied in class. And get upvoted, not because of the pertinence of their answer, but because many other people can share their experience. Their irrelevance is irrelevant.

To sum it up: a lot of people in /r/math is only familiar with the most basic tools of mathematics and the [high-school curriculum](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/12jzg2/what_is_this_image_missing/) (+171), and will gleefully upvote them. You want Karma? Post some neat little thing about [prime numbers](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/p5x53/every_odd_number_greater_than_1_is_the_sum_of_at/) (+262) or [trigonometry](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/121we1/i_had_trouble_keeping_trigonometry_straight_in_my/) (+70); anything more unusual will be ignored. 

We could push the argument to show the existence of another kind of idol: not subjects or mathematical objects, but famous mathematicians. However, while I believe this circlejerk exists, it is harder to expose. You may start to be bored, and want something fresh to fuel your superiority complex. Thankfully, there is a ripe fruit, ready to be eaten. Here is the biggest circlejerk of them all.


**Holiness**

Let's begin with some context. A popular reductionnist view asserts a hierarchy of sciences. Mathematics is the most fundamental science, as it relies only on basic logic and nothing else. Then comes physics, which uses mathematics; then chemistry, which is applied physics (molecules are only a bunch of atoms); then biology, which is applied chemistry (live beings are only a bunch of molecules)... Some people go as far as seing psychology as applied biology. Mathematics, being at the top of this metaphorical food chain, is obviously the best, right? Well, actually, some people have found a way to feel even more superior to some other people. The trick is to distinguish *pure mathematics* - basically, mathematics done for the sake of mathematics (e.g. mathematical logic and algebra) - and *applied mathematics* - mathematics done for application in other (who said lesser?) domains (e.g. statistics). This dichotomy exists in the real world, and I won't list the journals or departments of ""pure and applied amthematics"", of ""mathematics and their applications"", etc. 

My opinion is that it is mostly bullshit, but then again, it is only my opinion, and not necessary in any way for the following. Then point is that, on the one hand, you have universality of pure mathematics, done for the sake of mathematics, of beauty, or whatever you like; unbounded by our mundane, down to earth, dusty, *real* world. On the other hand, you have applied mathematics; but since they are here in opposition to pure mathematics, they are obviously *impure mathematics*, mingled with lesser sciences. Where does this leads us? In most isolated community built around a subject, the most involved and fanatic will be rewarded. In /r/math, you can expect that people will boast to like mathematics for itself, and not its applications; we can expect that anything supporting pure and holy mathematics will get upvoted mindlessly.

Well, bravo. You've won, you clever circlebroker.

From the FAQ:

&gt; If you've felt frustrated by the way math is taught in k-12, so did Lockhart. He wrote a fantastic essay on this very topic, read it [here](http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf).

Lockhart's Lament is a ten-year-old text which thoroughly critics the learning of mathematics in the United States - although the same could be said anywhere - and asks for mathematics to be taught as an art, like music, rather than as techniques. In his opinion mathematics should be self-sufficient, and applications mere byproducts. You can support this opinion, reject it completely, or even find some kind of middle ground; the important part is that the only piece of opinion in the FAQ already chooses its side in the ""pure against applied"" battle. While I believe I've already seen Lockhart's Lament used for Karma benefit in /r/math, I am unable to find any good quote. However, if you wish so, you may track it into other subreddits. 

Now, if you want more meat, you may go back to the two threads I pointed in the previous section. In ""[What is your most loved area in mathematics and why?](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/)"", the top answer is:

&gt; [I'm suprised nobody has mentioned number theory yet. It and its offsprings are something special.](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/c6rsetk) (+69)

This is actually a good quality comment. However, to explain the fact that it comes first, consider that this subject is included into pure mathematics (1 point), frequently deals with prime numbers and problem which are easy to formulate (1 point), and on the side is one of the areas of election of Terrence Tao, one of the mathematician idols of the subreddit (1 point), for a grand total of three points. The following best comments also ride the pure mathematics train: [category theory](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/c6rq1gn) (+44), [topology](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/c6rqjr8), [abstract algebra](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/c6rruya) (+33) (certainly because algebra alone does not sound abstract enough), [combinatorics](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/c6rs4k0) (+31), [algebra again](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1230jm/what_is_your_most_loved_area_in_mathematics_and/c6rrklj) (+22), because once wasn't enough...

In the [evil twin](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/120pg0/your_most_hated_topic_in_mathematics/) of this thread, the most hated topic in mathematics is of course:

&gt; [Statistics, with all my heart.](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/120pg0/your_most_hated_topic_in_mathematics/c6r6ugp) (+175)

Of course one of the most applied area of mathematics comes first. You even get some capslocked nonsense such as [statistics are not mathematics](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/120pg0/your_most_hated_topic_in_mathematics/c6r779x) (stupid comment, badly worded, and still at +37). The connaisseurs will appreciate the little [bayesian circlejerk](http://fr.reddit.com/r/math/comments/120pg0/your_most_hated_topic_in_mathematics/c6repwm) (+7) on the side.

Today, they reached a new level of braveness.

The submission [Matador Justice](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/zpouz/matador_justice_xpost_from_rpics/) (as of 9/11 at 7:05 pm PST) currently sits on top of the /r/JusticePorn Subbreddit's front page with 616 postive karma (1288▲/672▼). Lets go ahead and de-construct this perfect example of the /r/JusticePorn circlejerk.

**The Submission Itself:**

The thread started as [a cross post](http://fr.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/zpaok/matador_justice_nsfl/) from /r/pics with the title ""Matador Justice"". After being cross-posted it quickly made it's way to the top of the /r/JusticePorn's front page by pandering to the braveness of the JUSTICE ERRY DAY circljerk crowd that inhabits /r/JusticePorn. The submission shows this [picture](http://i.imgur.com/WmZfd.jpg) of a spanish matador getting gored in a fight with a bull (video of said fight can be seen [here](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=85b_1243583966)).

The circlejerkiness of this submission really comes from the subject matter of the post. Justice porn states in their rules:

&gt;Must include justice, don't stray away from the theme

Now you might ask yourself how a picture showing a Spanish Matador being gored by a bull is justice? The answer is that it is not. It is a tragedy from every (sane) perspective. The bull and the matador are both crippled in the fight. So how come this post currently sits on the top of the /r/JusticePorn frontpage? It is simple really. Reddit loves to hate (and upboat anything about) cruelty/the death of animals while they worship bacon, hamburgers, fried chicken, and many other meat products. Simple fact of the matter is that such things happen on this planet, why would it be justice if a person is gored along with the bull. Shouldn't it just be viewed as a tragedy on both parts? Even still these sort of posts continue to be upvoted by the mindless /r/JusticePorn circlejerk that worships the violent injuring between two beings.

----

**The Comments Within**^^^oh ^^^dat ^^^uber-circlejerk

Comments inside of the /r/JusticePorn subreddit tend to follow one of these simple, and easy to use template:

&gt; (person x) TOTALLY DESERVED WHAT WAS COMING TO HIM

or

&gt; I HOPE THAT (person x) DIES/IS MUDRERED/IS GORED

or

&gt; I THINK THAT (person X) DESERVED TO BE SHOT DEAD! EVERYONE WHO MAY BE GRIEVING OVER (person x's) DEATH IS WRONG AND SHOULD FEEL BAD FOR FEELING BAD

or

&gt; I FOR ONE FEEL THAT MY EGO HAS CLIMBED TO NEW HEIGHTS NOW THAT I HAVE WATCHED A VIDEO OF (PERSON X) BEING BEATEN BY (PERSON Y)

Many people use these templates to their fullest extent by changing some of the words to seem even more vulger/revenge driven.

One thing that I do want to make clear is this: Yes there are many bad people being displayed inside of the /r/JusticePorn subreddit, but do we really want to support the gut ""JUSTICE IS NEEDED"" reaction people get? 

The actual comments of this submission are just as HUMANS BAD, ANIMALS GOOD as you would guess. Comments such as 

[This (285▲/45▼):](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/zpouz/matador_justice_xpost_from_rpics/c66o0i4)

[and more(23▲/11▼):](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/zpouz/matador_justice_xpost_from_rpics/c66p5l5)^^^matador ^^^holocaust?

&gt; I know what we need to do. We need to breed a new kind of superbull, with steel-impregnable skin and an actual predatory instinct that makes it target people, and not waving cloth. Give it steroids until it has muscles coming out of it's muscles. Put on ""decorative"" clothing made of kevlar and titanium. Then challenge the ""top matador in Spain"" and get his ass gored on national television. Open invite for the next one. Lather, rinse, repeat.

**Yes bullfighting is a cruel sport.** **Yes the matador wounded the bull.** **Yes the entire sport is a barbaric display of cruelty.** Does that justify *you applauding the bull for causing a possibly deadly injury in the human?* Spanish matadors usually have a family history in the sport. It is their culture, their surroundings. I know you really hate the sport (I for one really dislike it too), but do you seriously ***have to make light of a human having his liver and kidney destroyed by a bull's horn.***

1375983827.0,126,self.circlebroke,1jyvzk,Why is Cycling so Popular in the Netherlands? Why is America so stupid?,redmosquito,207,81,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1jyvzk/why_is_cycling_so_popular_in_the_netherlands_why/,"http://np.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/1jyc1v/why_is_cycling_so_popular_in_the_netherlands/

Welcome to /r/truereddit, also known as ""hey didn't this actually used to be a pretty good subreddit like 3 years ago?""  Today we're having a conversation why so many people ride bikes instead of cars in the Netherlands and why that has *nothing to do with the fact that the Netherlands is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.*

&gt;The bike is the ideal form of personal transport, but because it's so inexpensive there's no massive multi-national corporations like there is in the automobile industry or oil and gas to represent the interests of bicyclists. Without a critical mass of people who will politically support the mode choice, it's tough to improve the situation.

Cycling is perfect but because of those damn corporations there is nary a bicycle in America.  Another uses agrees with the main premise, but argues that bikes are not ideal for all people and situations

&gt;Eh, the bike is the ideal form of personal transport for relatively short distances in good weather for people who are physically capable of pedalling (this excludes the ill, infirm, elderly, children, etc), who do not need to carry significant loads. There's also a significant safety issue...not a major concern to me given my fondness for both bikes and motorcycles, but significant nonetheless even if all you do is plow into a bench.
In congested cities I'd love to see more support of walking and cycling (I complain about lack of sidewalks constantly), but that doesn't mean that there isn't a massive need for automotive transportation. The speeds readily available to even a scooter are difficult to consistently maintain on a bike in normal city traffic.

Comment sitting at 15 up 14 down currently.  How dare you question the convenience of the bicycle!  

&gt;We bike in the rain or snow just fine here in the Netherlands, and children and elderly (except if they are infirm) bike just fine here. You'd also be amazed how much loot you can transport using bicycle bags (I don't know if that is an actual word)

The Netherlands is well known for it's brutal winters.  Not wanting to show up sweaty to the office is no excuse either, look at how cool biking makes this guy:

&gt;I work in IT. I show up sweaty or sometimes even change shirts when I arrive. It works out fine. It doubles my commute time, but I get to completely ignore traffic and as far as I can tell, it actually builds some pretty baus social cred at the office.

What about population density?

&gt;Not exactly true, no one is talking about cycling from amsterdam to the hague, the size of states is irrelevant and an easy out for your argument - it doesn't hold up - this is about people who live in the city cycling around.
Friend lives there regularly cycles a distance to hop a train to get to work. So cycles 4km to get train 40km and then returns etc.
Anything 8 -15km one way and I would feel obliged to cycle it there. It is not about geography it is about culture. You don't see the same in many similarly sized cities around. Edinburgh, Dublin off the top of my head that I also lived in.

Doesn't matter.  Another uses is downvoted for arguing that cycling might not be the ideal choice for every person

&gt;Note: I'm not hating on Cycling, as I (as an American) regularly bike to work and to school. My argument is that Population Density drives this. What about Groceries? Many people need to drive miles to get to a store to buy things like food. I know many people who shop for a month at a time because they need to be working and there's very little time for things like shopping.
You can't drag several hundred pounds of food over 5-10 miles with a Bicycle.
Also hills are my demise. To get to work I have to go down an extremely steep hill (going to say its &gt; 45 degree incline) and up one of an equal incline.
I could go on and on on why Cycling is viable in some places more than others. Have you ever Cycled in subzero weather (F or C, it doesn't matter really). I have for one and people think I'm crazy for doing it.

I like cycling, and I support bicycle infrastructure and other forms of public transportation.  I just wish people realize how huge of factor population density and terrain has on how viable these things are.  [Much of Europe is orders of magnitude more dense than the USA](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/World_population_density_map.PNG/800px-World_population_density_map.PNG), and the Netherlands is not a very good model for most of this country.

The article is about an ongoing court case in which lawyers allege conspiracy.  It's a way-out-of-the-park homerun of inflammatory yellow journalism to begin with, but it takes a turn in the first comment:

&gt;activists accused of conspiring against a polluting oil corporation?

&gt;The same private corporation could be granted access to these people's communications?

&gt;This is exactly why the NSA scandal is such a big deal.[+867]

Yes, because a judge ruled that the IP information of certain relevant individuals was germane to the case, the NSA is to blame.  But it's really a daily double here of corporation hate and government hate.  Mix it all into one pot and get a stellar circlejerk!

&gt;Chevron and the NSA are one and the same thing.[+145]

Q.E.D. motherfucker.

Later on, a reply to the first quote:

&gt;I'm convinced at this point the only way we'll have any (VERY NEEDED) change is when someone finally gets fed up enough to actually catalyze something big such as a militia to dethrone our current **totalitarian state** and the congress built on corporate lies and personal interests.[+76]

Emphasis not mine.  Totalitarian you say?  Indeed fine sir, I would give you an upvote but the NSA will monitor this action and catalog it and hold it against me when I'm tortured to reveal my libertarianism in a FEMA Gulag in Arkansas run by a for-profit corporation that is controlling all of our minds with HAARP.

Revolution, as you say sir, will solve all the problems:

&gt;If people can't be motivated enough to get out and vote they sure as hell won't start an armed revolution.[+8]

Or any redditor just crying about revolution while eating cheetos and drinking Mountain Dew and playing Starcraft.  Everyone else should start the revolution so you can go about your day as usual.

&gt;There does not seem to be an organized militia to join.[upvotes hidden]

Oh, there are plenty.  They're all crazy right-wing extremists though, so you probably won't get along with them.  You and your tin foil buddies can go flopping around the local woodlands taking pot shots and Birch trees and squirrels and go home at night feeling confident that you could take on the American military.

&gt;Is there any information on what law or prescedence this falls under?[+48]

&gt;&gt;The obey your corporate masters act of 1980.[+58]

I applaud your wit!  But, for real, it's really a real thing.

But, Lo!  A voice of reason appears:

&gt;If anybody wants a link about the story with actual facts and way less bias:[+104]

How banal.  Facts.  Pfft.  Lets get on with the jerking!

&gt;I'm really tired of the way the government not only decides to quash the Constitution on our own citizens, but blatantly interpret it as non-existent for anyone outside of the U.S. As if ""unalienable rights"" somehow makes a difference where you were born.
What's worst of all, is that people are afraid to even speak against it, in fact, I feel like I'm taking some sort of personal risk to even say this. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness suddenly feel like playground sayings of a forgotten era.

So.  Fucking.  Brave.  You took a huge risk posting this and I upvote you sir!  I will protest for your release from prison!  Be safe out there!

Reply:

&gt;its ridiculous. im afraid to comment on reddit now even

Yes, it is scary isn't it, commenting on a public forum that has always been public.  You should be afraid to say things in public too, especially to girls, because they might be NSAgents.

I can't stand this BS anymore.  This whole reaction to the non-issue of the NSA's recent activities has almost made me quit reddit on several occasions.  The [second leaked slide](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/#) says, very specifically, how this data capture can only be used against foreign nationals overseas.  But this isn't important enough to warrant the attention of the jerk.  No, the possibility that, in the course of an investigation, the NSA might find out how you have a predilection for Hentai and stalking women on facebook is too much to bear!  To the revolution!

Seriously, what is going on, lately? I understand the anti-NSA jerk, and I'm getting used to the anti-Obama jerk, but I never thought I'd see the day that reddit goes right wing. Don't believe me? Hey, neither do I!

http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1gxkta/heres_my_shot_at_it_blank_inside/ (3300+)  
  
A joke about Obama spying on citizens. Lately, this is not that unusual. With the NSA as an endless supply of lube, reddit has been jerking for several weeks, with a lot of jerktasmic jerktacity directed towards the current commander in chief.  
    
But what about his predecessor?   
    
After browsing through /r/all for a bit, I noticed a picture of President Bush.  ""Haven't seen something about him in a while,"" I thought.  Imagine my surprise reading this caption, a rebuttal to a quote by Kanye West:  
    
&gt; Made stopping HIV/AIDS in Africa a top priority and spent $44 billion on the cause, saving an estimated 5 million lives.  &gt;Accused of not caring about black people  
  
www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1gxi8k/kanye_needs_to_do_his_research/  
  
I couldn't believe my eyes. A pro-Bush post on reddit, currently sitting on 1500+ net karma. How could this happen here?  Are redditors so fickle that they will mock the man they used to collectively blow day and night and upvote the man who just a year or so ago was [Le]terally Mittler? The whole jerk is even more pathetic when you realize that Kanye made that statement in *2005!* We're so desperate to jerk we're willing to use 8-year-old lube! Again, how could this happen?  
  
This comment in this thread says it all:  
    
&gt;Say what you want about Cheney, but George Bush is genuinely a nice guy and actually cares about helping people (+186)  
    
Yeah, Bush is a real stand-up guy and not just because I can easily contrast him to the person I see as his opposite... Who we dislike now! But fuck Cheney, right? We don't like him yet.  
  
Well, they just might soon enough.  
    
Your looking into a subreddit. A world where consistency,  either in thought or principle, doesn't matter, and a vote in the up direction matters more than discussion.  This, is the /r/politics zone.  
    
The post in question is typical circlejerk material: A quote that is an accusation and a popular opinion:  
  
&gt;""Snowden Is Not The Problem; The Problem Is Government Violating Our Fourth Amendment Right""  
    
Seems like pretty typical jerking material, like I said. Except the quote is from Sarah Palin.  Did I mention that link is at +1880 karma right now?  
  
http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1gwp5m/sarah_palin_snowden_is_not_the_problem_the/  
    
That's right, people. reddit has antijerked so hard against the president that it will give upvotes - en masse! - to an antigoverntment Palin quote.  
  
PALIN-LIMBAUGH 2016

Edit: typos and formatting

Edit2: this has been a learning experience for me. After reading some of the comments, I realize my arguments were not as solid as I originally thought:  

1) Some anti-Obama sentiment is not necessarily indicative of a right wing argument, as privacy concerns can outweigh previous political alliances.  
2) Pointing out one positive point of the previous administration is not necessarily indicative of right wing sentiment, but may just be a small area of agreement in opposition to another entity (in this case, Kanye West). However, the case of a rebuttal to an eight-year-old comment shows, in my view, some desperation to fit in with the new norm.
3) /r/politics agreeing with Sarah Palin, although surprising, actually shows more consistency in the political concerns (privacy) of reddit than it does a jerk. Reddit can simultaneously hate Sarah Palin and agree with her on one issue, shown by the top comment on that thread being anti-Palin and getting a higher upvote score than the actual post.

More often than not, these tattoos go against what is normally popular in the thread and instead appeal to the wider Reddit audience - videogame references, watercolours, abstract/modern art pieces, etc. But the tattoos themselves aren't what I'm here to talk about.

The comments. My god, the comments.

One of the more annoying trends is for people to post about the location of the OP (submissions in /r/tattoos are required to say who did the work and where) and to announce their upvotes because of said location.

The other trend is just general off topic crap. The subreddit is for discussion of tattoos - critiquing work, researching artists and styles, answering questions and assuaging doubts. But that's not what happens when the rest of Reddit finds its way into the sub.

Take, for example, [this recent thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/1c2ncq/calvin_by_ty_at_ink_addiction_in_saskatoon/) from last week. It's a Calvin &amp; Hobbes tattoo, so of course it got upvoted like crazy and OF COURSE the comments are irrelevant.

[""So glad he's not peeing on something""](http://np.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/1c2ncq/calvin_by_ty_at_ink_addiction_in_saskatoon/c9cfzc7) the top comment says with a sigh of relief.

Unfortunately, the next top irrelevant comment comes from a CB favourite user, asking OP [""Have you considered becoming enlightened by your intelligence?""](http://np.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/1c2ncq/calvin_by_ty_at_ink_addiction_in_saskatoon/c9cg38n) - purely because OP's tattoo has the word ""euphoria"" in it.

Then the location comments begin.

We have a huge Canadian circlejerk (for some reason the location jerk always seems to be Canada, go figure) [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/1c2ncq/calvin_by_ty_at_ink_addiction_in_saskatoon/c9cgqu6), with smaller jerks throughout the comments.

It's not until about halfway down the page that there's finally a comment on the tattoo itself that isn't just ""good/great tattoo"" or jerking over Calvin &amp; Hobbes.

Then today we have a new post to make the bigtime and draw in the great unwashed. [OP got a tattoo](http://np.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/1cd590/drawing_by_my_friend_who_committed_suicide_just/) of a drawing from her friend who recently committed suicide. It's reasonably well done, although technically facing the wrong way. But it's ""unique"" and the sad circumstances (""sob story"" for all you empathy-less STEMlords) are enough to get it popular.

Pretty much every comment is expressing condolences and simple complements on the tattoo - it's a mindless echo chamber but it's harmless.

However, a novelty account pops up in reply to the top comment and we're off with irrelevant comments, karma trains and good ol' Reddit entitlement.

/u/IGiveFreeCompliments posts a sappy self affirmation comment, which has since been deleted but was reposted [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/1cd590/drawing_by_my_friend_who_committed_suicide_just/c9fhkqe) by another user.

It's followed by [a stupidly saccharine jerk](http://np.reddit.com/r/tattoos/comments/1cd590/drawing_by_my_friend_who_committed_suicide_just/c9ffe92), with bonus username discussion at the end.

Thread: http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/19pmwg/silicon_valley_reportedly_full_of_stoners_silicon/

Reddit channels ABC afterschool specials and lets you know that ""Everybody's doin it"" for the top post:

&gt;Its 2013. Every non-police workplace is full of stoners.

http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/19pmwg/silicon_valley_reportedly_full_of_stoners_silicon/

The comment reply mentions how many people he knows smoke pot in spite of the fact they could have serious career consequences if they get caught. When talking about pot on reddit this is apparently a good thing.

&gt;I work in DC. Most of my coworkers have clearances, and of course drugs are a big no-no for people who want clearance.

&gt;Half the people here smoke anyway.

This guy mentions how pot got him his STEM degree:

&gt;I attribute pot to one of the sole reasons I was able to wrap my mind around coding while going to college. Early in my freshman year, I was having a tough time getting over some simple, fundamental looping constructs and dot-notation for objects (yeah, they started us off in Java -- yuck -- I think as some kind of torture).

&gt;A half-bowl later, I was a master. It apparently relaxed my mind, made me a bit more creative, and also gave me the gumption and balls to just say, ""fuck it, what if I do this?"" instead of stressing about the ""correct"" way to do something before writing a line, and, like magic, it worked.

This post is a bit further down but I'm gonna put it up towards the top because I enjoyed how it's true in more ways than the author intended.

&gt;I smoked daily for an entire decade. I want to smack anyone who makes broad generalizations about how the drug affects people. **A good reason the drug is still illegal is because of the idiotic evangelism**.

http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/19pmwg/silicon_valley_reportedly_full_of_stoners_silicon/c8q9506

A redditor mentions how much his pot smoking helps him at his writing and coding job. Oh wait, excuse me. The dude actually isn't employed and is just talking out of his ass.

&gt;As a writer and a coder I can confirm that marijuana is a magical awesome drug where if my future employer attempted to tell me what I can and cannot do with the time that I'm not spending in the office I would tell them to go sit on a tack. I show up, I spend my 8 hours doing anything and everything you want, and then for 16 hours I get to be a free human being that can do anything I want keeping in mind that after the 16 hour period I'm expected to be in a state where I can work for those 8 hours and be ok. I can do this after 20 joints, I have a hard time doing it after 4 drinks.

This guy thinks Brave New World sounds like a great place because it effectively mixes his unique blend of libertarianism and totalitarianism which totally don't contradict each other.  He actually is getting downvoted, but RES shows him having approx 29 upvotes.

&gt;This is why I like the idea of Brave New World, because everyone works and puts in their share of labor then **when they leave work they do pretty much whatever the hell they want. Which is how it should be. What I do in my free time is up to me, and me alone.**

&gt;EDIT: No, I did not miss the point of Brave New World, **I simply don't value liberty and freedom** more highly than human progress, happiness, and peace. Liberty and freedom are only acceptable when they aren't abused, and since there's no consensus on what constitutes abuse I find that it is not only easier but actually preferable to strip freedoms and liberty away so long as the society is unified in its decision to treat everyone well and attempt to secure happiness and constant comfort for everyone.

I just very much wanted to whinge and don't mean to break rules or repeat the obvious if I do. Be gent[le].)

Many of you are probably familiar with the zealous debate regarding the use of NSFW tags that flares up occasionally, with an equal number of users feeling that such tags are either insufficiently used or too liberally applied. I'd also wager that you may be familiar with the 'Butthole' novelty account, who only posts links to images of what is apparently his own butthole (I would provide a link to their account for context but it has been recreated so regularly following bans that I couldn't even guess the numeric suffix he is on by now). Any time that this user provides such material in a thread, there is fervent criticism against his novelty and subsequent warnings from fellow users that the only responsible thing to do is provide NSFW tag. I have seen this novelty account inspire imitators who seem equaling keen on hiding their potentially irresponsible content in plain sight, of which my latest discovery highlights a massive hypocrisy in the reddit crowd (*surprise surprise*).

It seems that the altruistic safeguarding of our fellow user's digital dignity is only a zealous issue when the reddit crowd *doesn't like* the NSFW images that are being posted un-tagged.

In this highly rated /r/videos submission - [""best slap i've ever seen""](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/142k60/best_slap_ive_ever_seen/) - the second topmost comment is from account ['PostsBoobs' (6 days old)](/u/PostsBoobs), which is an ASCII 'art' link to a .gif of a girl dancing with her boobs out:

This is swiftly followed by the erudite proclamations of fellow gentleman scholars applauding the novelty account:

&gt; [""I'm gonna be totally serious right now. If you keep posting boobs of this quality, I'm just going to accept you as part of the reddit experience. Like pigeons in NYC.

None of the currently visible comments share any warning that this is NSFW material. Expanding those comments below threshold, we find a now [deleted] comment that I presume was a sincere complaint or warning about NSFW material which evoked this response:

&gt; [""Like someone said in another thread I saw today. His name is postsboobs, the text is a pair of ascii boobs, and people are surprised and angry when they find out the link is boobs too."" +4](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/142k60/best_slap_ive_ever_seen/c79jxen?context=4)

Alongside this are several significantly downvoted comments that at least imply the NSFW content of the parent link, however it seems difficulty to tell whether they have been downvoted by the pro-boob crowd out of scorn for even questioning the value of posting porn, or by the anti-boob crowd who dislike the flippancy of the possible defense of un-tagged NSFW content suggested by their sarcasm.

What pisses me off is not that this is NSFW content or that I am offended (I'm not), nor do I have particularly strong opinions regarding how often NSFW tags should be used. I have once or twice posted warnings following such novelty accounts out of empathy for those who may genuinely be at work - knowing that I would appreciate such a gesture in their shoes. Nor am I concerned with questions around how much attention redditors should or should not be paying to account names and links when redditing, knowing full well how easy it is to get lazy or skim through comments. What pisses me off is the blatant hypocrisy in such communal adoration for something that - divorced from the actual image content provided - is essentially the same act as something they chastise.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,1354391723.0,,,True,t3_143u49,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/143u49/reddit_hypocrisy_and_the_sexualization_of_novelty/,

Out of all the shocking, disgusting, bewildering, and downright ignorant things I've seen on this site, this was the first to induce a state of utter disbelief. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10ekun/i_found_porn_on_my_sons_internet_broswer_did_i_go/

The OP, a father who discovered a trove of pornography on his 13-year-old son's computer, employs the cliche title structure of ""hey reddit...did I do this correctly?"", implying that he's already harboring doubts about the way he handled this situation and needs to seek approval and reassurance from the reddit community. 

Moving into the body of the posting, the OP explains that while cleaning a virus off of his son's computer, he looked at his son's browser history and saw a bunch of pornography. He decides that rather than confronting his son in person about this sensitive and important topic (and allow for a teachable moment), he will passively leave a word document discussing the issue open on his son's computer. He includes in his post the text of the word document.

The word document opens rather benignly, in the language typical to a permissive, ""best-friend"" type parent, telling the son that he loves him and it's ok to look at porn, he did it too, etc. He does strangely seem to harp on the fact that visiting porn sites could cause viruses that would damage his son's ""1800 dollar computer"" , but whatever, he has already shown himself to be a passive parent and maybe he feels too awkward discussing the actual issue at hand. But then comes the bombshell when the father ACTUALLY LINKS HIS SON TO OTHER PORN SITES, claiming that they are ""better"" because they will not leave a virus on the computer: 

&gt;There are sites that are completely safe and you can go on them and not have your computer turned into a piece of junk. You can go to these sites and not screw up your computer. Don't click on any links taking you to other sites and please only go to these. Ninty percent of porn sites have crap that can brick a computer.
www.pornmd.com www.pornhub.com www.xvideos.com www.xhamster.com www.beeg.com

The OP then goes on to re-assure his son that he's done nothing wrong, continuously referring to the viruses that could ""fry his 1800 dollar machine"" as the only thing that he has done wrong.

Although I was shocked at the fact that any parent could be so irresponsible, what really got to me was the fact that the majority of the comments actually praised his actions, telling him that he had done an excellent job of parenting, wishing their own fathers had acted the same way and the like. 

For example, the fifth ""best"" post, with over 1,000 upvotes:

&gt;This is an awesome approach. When my dad caught me, all he said was, ""Well at least we know you aren't gay."" Thanks dad.... Anyways keep up the good parenting

While ""well at least we know you aren't gay"" isn't a good way to handle this situation, clearly neither was the OP's way.

And below, the very ""best"" comment, once again approving of the OP before turning into an oh-so-tasteful deluge of religious jokes:

&gt;Much better than my parents. I had printed off a risque pic of a lovely young lady that was simply breasts and hidden it under my bed temporarily. Took it to my cousins later amd he asked about the writing on the back. I'm like ""What writing?"" and there it is...... my mothers handwriting.... with the note asking simply... ""What would you tell Jesus if he returned while you were looking at this?"" Never mentioned it to her.........ever.

The comments go on, with many of the other top comments jokes about thanking the father for linking them to new porn sites or about the father sitting there watching his son while he masturbates (the most upvoted comment with over 2,000 points):

&gt;Nah, you should have gone the cigarette route and sit there and watch until he's beat off to every last one of those videos.

But no one seems to reprimand the father or suggest that he should have handled the situation in a different way. It just goes on and on with people telling him he handled the situation well. 

You have to switch over to the controversial comments just to find posts that don't blithely approve of the OP's handling of the situation. This comment, for example, with 1 point, took exactly the right approach:

&gt;This is one of the worst displays of ""parenting"" I've ever seen. Are you proud of yourself? Proud of showing your son that being cool and buddy-buddy with your son is more important than your relationship with your wife? Proud of showing him that it's okay to lie to your significant other? Where do you draw the line in lying to the one you love? How does he know that? How is he to respect his mother as much as you, now that y'all have this secret together, this secret that his mom just can't handle for whatever reason your small brain uses to justify these actions? And you encourage him to watch porn as far as giving him sites to go to...sites with orgies and bukkake and men demeaning women and thousands of other perversions, and you encourage him to visit those sites, with no sort of guidance whatsoever as to what he is going to see. Do you think it's appropriate for him to have those sort of images in his head when he's hanging around young high school girls? What do you think he's going to think of them, after being encouraged by his father to view videos of girls like them being degraded and cummed on and treated like animals? If I had a daughter, I certainly wouldn't want her around some kid who watches that sort of thing with not only his father's consent, but his father's encouragement! Your son isn't allowed to drink or smoke for a reason. His brain isn't fully developed yet. He can't handle those things without damaging its development. And here you are pushing this stuff on him without a word of advice on how badly women are portrayed in porn. You have done him a great disservice, and you should be ashamed of trying to be his friend when he needs you to be his dad.

One other comment, while more of a rant then a helpful comment, rightly points out that OP may even have broken the law:

&gt;Also you just possibly commited a felony by providing pronographic material to a minor, I suggest you delete this thread before you lose your kid rightfuly and have a police officer at your door

Look, I understand that reddit likes to bend over backwards to show that it is an accepting, open community, but posts like this make me wonder if it's becoming a full-on bastion of moral relativism. Nothing is wrong; everything is permitted; the only moral thing to do in any situation is accept what others are doing. OP has done a major disservice to his child, who, while still developing mentally and emotionally, now has explicit approval from his father to look at all manner of pornographic material, including the number of disturbing, degrading, and disgusting videos available on sites like these. 

I'm not naive enough to think that the OP can truly do anything to stop his on from looking at porn; most people do, and that's not what this is about. It's the fact that a young boy's father actually aided him and gave his explicit approval for this activity, giving him access to material that encourages exploitative and sometimes even dangerous activities. Maybe this is an isolated incident, or maybe it is just another signal of our society's slowly failing ability to decipher between right and wrong. If reddit's comments are any indication of the views of the younger generation, my generation, then I'm beginning to fear it's the latter.

So let's summerize: Reddit HATES celebs relying on their looks. Paris Hilton, the Kardashians and everything alike. How dare you to sell your looks and pretend to be stupid and get moneyz. Well, but if your just a random girl that a ""friend"" of her cousin posted on the internet, it's very acceptable to creep about it. Reddit even upvotes it, even though it has not much to nothing at all to do with /r/funny. It's also okay when you are a pornstar, because that's just awesome as you help me to fap.

As we all know ever since the Anderson Cooper Jailbait fiasco pedophilia has been a very popular topic on Reddit. They defend it, they rationalize it (""ephebophilia""), they attack it. 

This TIL has brought out all three sides. So far the people attacking it seem to be on top, but for most of the comments saying it is bad there are multiple replies defending or rationalizing it. 

My biggest problem is the people defending and rationalizing don't seem to realize that people are often abused to make CP, and people viewing it creates a market that leads to more abuse, simple supply and demand. These people have no empathy for the victims, to them they are not people, they are objects. 

Sure some 16 year olds might film themselves fucking or a 17 year old might post a pic of her boobs on 4chan, but I'm guessing very little CP that is distributed on the internet is self-made.

Anyway I would like an expert to comment.

For starters, the video shows no actual police brutality. He's alone in a house and is whining into a camera, clearly hysterical, while a large number of police are outside. They bust down his door and arrest him. There is no prior information provided, but there are other videos where he appears to have a history of police, intermixed with a whole lot of crazy. The guy is clearly unstable, all of his videos reflect this, as well as his subscriptions.

&gt;Here's a message he posted on another video, let's help this man out!

&gt;&gt;""Outside my door on 7/16/2012 I hear my 65 year old military veteran woman neighbor screaming for her life for help! I crack my door and her 300lbs 7' tall 45 year old boyfriend who's an x cop - was about to kill her. I cracked my door and he stepped right thru me and the door in one second flat. Punched me in my nose and monologued for 5 minutes. After he left I called 911 I and his girlfriend desperate for help! I had to make 4 separate calls to get help. When it arrived you see by the video I posted (hit more videos button) see the police and paramedics refuse to help me. I turned on my camera to document it. They are clear on film forcing me to shut off. As soon as camera went off a cop put me in cuffs behind my back and brutally up punched my guts. The paramedics laughed they never arrested the x cop for assault as I almost died. The dr's said my Internal bleeding was so bad I was minutes from death had I not reached their care at that very moment i would be dead on arrival as more then 2 of our 4 liters of blood in our body had seeped hemeraged into my abdominal area. Was about to die when reached dr's care. The police and paramedics almost killed me what some call a stupid hero for saving the neighbors by opening my door. Don't play a hero it will get you killed and no body cares about you not the paramedics not the cops not anyone. You have no recourse. I posted these videos and when came home from hospital was warned by the police to remove these videos or else. The very next day with my open wounds they invaded my home on film nearly killing me and had no warrant. My family has had to flee because we were warned death threats if I don't take down the truth abuse by dirty cops videos. You lost your right people if I lost mine. I have a 6 year old son and a wife all lost with my spleen my guts assorted organs removed per dr's.

Surely he doesn't try to justify his actions, right? WRONG
&gt;Most girls don't really understand how horny guys are, how much stronger guys are, how guys will rationalize what they do. I see feminists and women on the Internet saying that no means no and women should be able to get as drunk as they want and not be sexually assaulted, and I couldn't agree me. But the reality of the situation is that women have to be careful because guys are one way when they're hanging out and another way when they're horny or worse drunk and horny. That doesn't make what happened okay, but it is what it is. 

Reddit loves this idea.  [Maybe rape wouldn't happen if all men assaulted their female friends.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x6yef/reddits_had_a_few_threads_about_sexual_assault/c5jrsga)

&gt;I want to comment to your ""how much stronger guys are"" remark. I wish more girls would realize this. I had a friend who put herself in stupid situations quite regularly, but felt like she could take care of herself if she had too. Typical 130ish pound girl. I was a 240 or so and 6'2"".

&gt;One night, I decided to open her eyes a bit. The topic came up again one way or another, and she was talking about her self defense class. I said, if a good chunk of guys wanted, they could do whatever they wanted to you and you couldn't stop it. She disagreed, I said, ""we'll see"" and quickly grabbed her and pressed her against a wall. Since I had so much longer reach and much more strength I could hold her there no problem. Initially there was quite a bit of panic on her face, she clawed at my arm a bit and tried to kick but I just let her. After the moment of panic I just said, ""now imagine I wanted to hurt you.""

Yeah, these are not attention cuts. People do not cut in fact themselves different if they want to gain attention or just hurt themselves. It's not about killing yourself. People cut themselves to avoid killing themselves and try to relieve stress. I really hate the armchair psychology bullshit like this.

You're gonna retire on that, cock-knocker? YOU NEED 1.5 MILLION IN THE BANK IN FIVE YEARS' TIME TO SUSTAIN YOUR LIFESTYLE - AND THAT ASSUMES YOU DIE WHEN YOU'RE 85!!!
""Oh, we'll just work longer.""
Fuuuuuuck you. BTW, your POS $400,000 McMansion that has 20 years left on the mortgage is not an investment.
Nice garage full of classic muscle cars, though - I bet you'll get a nickel each when every other boomer retires and has to sell them off, completely collapsing the market.
Fucking retards.

Gobs of upvotes and comments, especially on celebrating low prices of muscle cars. Very little attention on replies that questioned his idea that all boomers are ""fucking retards"".

&gt;(+345)Yep, even more frustrating when they don't realize how lucky they were.

&gt;&gt;(+228)Every person over 50 I talk to that doesn't understand why good, talented, educated people can't find jobs.
I was an Army trained X-ray tech, and damn good at it. I got laid off twice, along with other people just because of the economy and general downsizing because of seniority. The older techs were lazy, and just made all the students do all the work.
Then all I hear from people after I got my BSN was, ""Well why didn't you stay in radiography?"" .... because there are no fucking jobs there. Vicious cycle.... I am sure it will be a great field to go back into in about 5 years. Until then... fuck a whole bunch of that.

So ALL people over 50 just can't understand. They're all lazy too, but I'm skilled and ambitious.

At +184, next post says Baby boomers should be working longer. A tiny bit of real discussion.

Under that is someone giving away his ""How to steal your boss's job"" book. Hm.

2 more posts down, there's another Baby Boomers should be working longer post only this time with replies.

&gt;(+88) A good majority of them can't afford to. Mortgages are upside-down, helping kids will school loans, medical bills piling up. Look at all the retirees and seniors who are trying to go back to work.

Then the replies.

&gt;(+52)

&gt;&gt;Mortgages are upside-down

&gt;Who's mortgages? Most of the people hit hard by the housing bubble bought way too high in the 2000s, that's not most of the people who are retired or are about to. Needless to say as well the writing was on the wall in pretty fucking huge letters. 

&gt;&gt; helping kids will school loans

&gt;The probably shouldn't have voted to defund state education programs while creating a culture of everyone must be college educated. 

&gt;&gt;medical bills piling up

&gt;The public option was on the table less than 4 years ago, but was shot down by retirees because they fear big government. 

&gt;&gt;Look at all the retirees and seniors who are trying to go back to work.

&gt;They could have voted to increase social security payments by taxing themselves more instead of rehasing a mantra about how it's going to go broke for so many years. Or being smart with their money. They are the ones in power because they vote in large numbers. 

&gt;I don't want to hear them whine and complain about living a hard life when they should have had the foresight to realize that they weren't as good with some of their money as they thought. Americans especially don't realize that they aren't paying for someone else so much as paying themselves later or earlier in life through government programs. 

So all baby boomers are the same, are all evil conservatives, self-awarely helped create an environment needing education, and are responsible for every problem in government.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/zvpab/how_google_fiber_is_trying_embarrass_the_cable/

Before starting: [here's some blantant karma-whoring](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/zvpab/how_google_fiber_is_trying_embarrass_the_cable/c685mge)

Here's my gripe about the thread as a whole. Gigabit fiber-to-the-home projects have existed for several years ([2004 - HongKong deployed 1Gbps FTTH](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/100Mbps-Symmetrical-4850-87851), [2010 - EPB Announces 1Gbps FTTH in Chattanooga, TN](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Chattanooga-MuniFiber-Offering-1-Gbps-110311?nocomment=1), [2011 - Sonic.net Announces $70/mo 1Gbps FTTH trials (with two phone lines and free calling)](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Sonic-Offers-1-Gbps-For-70-114594?nocomment=1). Gfiber hasn't even been deployed to a single home yet, and yet there's already all these projects out there that are being ignored. (by the way, there are some other small 1Gbps FTTH projects in the US, but I left quite a few of them out of this on purpose).

The common mantra at work here is that Google's project is going to ""shake up the ISP industry"". As you can see, 1Gbps FTTH has existed in the US for over two years without shaking up the industry, and Sonic's trials have gone on for over a year without changing anything (not to mention that they're pricing their fiber the same as Google for the beta trials). The biggest changes in speeds have been started by price/speed wars between Verizon's FiOS and Comcast (like the new 300Mbps [cable](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/120503)/[FiOS](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Verizon-Confirms-FiOS-Speed-Increases-300-Mbps-119727) tiers).

Of course, the next argument that's deployed is that it's only going to change things because it's *Google*. The company with [a long list of failed projects](http://i.imgur.com/QQwmX.jpg). Not to mention that picture is from 2010, there's already quite a few more to add onto that list. [Here's another list of 20 failed products](http://memeburn.com/2011/08/the-google-graveyard-20-products-that-failed/). Google is king of the beta — and if they don't like it, into the bin it goes!

Still don't agree with me? Then why does their contract with the Kansas City Government explicitly include a clause allowing them to [exit the project within (or after, the wording isn't clear) two years](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Google-Can-Ditch-Kansas-City-After-Two-Years-120807)?

Ah yes, Google fiber must be a [success story of capitalism](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/zvpab/how_google_fiber_is_trying_embarrass_the_cable/c689orj)! Disregarding the general hate for capitalism and big business, let's focus on things like the construction location and costs. Contrary to popular belief, Google fiber is [not a free market success story](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Google-Fiber-the-Free-Market-Success-Story-That-Wasnt-121078). They got very, very lucky for Kansas City, and the model they used there isn't something that they'll be able to replicate anywhere else.

Now, let me sidetrack onto a different tangent. The cost of this all. How is Google going to be making money on $70/mo 1Gbps, when [Utopia claims to be loosing money on their $300/mo 1Gbps FTTH service](http://www.gfiberforum.com/forum/threads/17-Utopia-FTTH-not-ready-to-budge-from-300-month-gigabit-service-plan)? Despite cheaper costs on some stuff, they're still going to be paying a LOT of money for the infrastructure. There's a lot of figures floating around on this, ranging from $6k to $1500, but it's pretty fair to assume, given current technology and Google's sweetheart deal with Kansas City, we're looking at around $1500 (for combined passby and consumer hookup). You aren't going to be making much profit off of $70/month 1Gbps service, even if you're Google, and have great already-existing cheap bandwidth contracts. So, how are they going to make the money? The common theory here is by monitoring internet use, then using the data for targeted advertising. However, since we don't have proof for that, I'll leave the conspiracies out of this for now.

One thing we DO know about 1Gbps is that it's pretty damn fast. Seeing as I have a dedicated server with a 1Gbps fiber line, sitting in a datacenter up in Toronto, I might as well show you what 1Gbps looks like on speedtest sites.

http://speedtest.net/result/1960836609.png

http://speedtest.net/result/2059787466.png

It's worth noting that those servers are located in the same city as my dedi, so here's what a test to a (far) offsite server look like.

http://www.speedtest.net/result/1908466130.png

This is just using basic hardware. i3-2100, standard HDD, and what looks like Ethernet -&gt; router -&gt; fiber internet connection (BGP mix of Hurricane Electric, Cogent, and Tata Communications). Not a very fancy or high quality bandwidth mix, and my gigabit line isn't dedicated bandwidth.

So, I'm sure that you're bemused about me linking to a test from my server. Well, let's take a look at some speedtests from Google Fiber users at some existing Kansas City demo installations.

http://i.imgur.com/D5x9E.png

No, this is not over a wireless network, this is the wired result. See post here: http://gigaom.com/2012/07/31/google-fiber-in-the-real-world-heres-whats-good-and-what-needs-work/

Okay, maybe it's just a fluke! Nope. I had the luck of getting some results from another person who visited a location with their 1Gbps line. Let's look at the test to the Google server:

[930Mbps](http://i.imgur.com/KlwFs.jpg)

Pretty good, right? Oh wait, it's to Google (the speedtest site/app they're using isn't even accessible to anyone on the public internet, this should tell you a lot about what kind of ""test"" they're using). Let's see what a third-party like speedtest.net shows.

[319Mbps](http://i.imgur.com/WyAbS.jpg)

Further testing showed that [downloads are ratelimited to around 300Mbps each](http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r27511430-Interesting.).

Now, I had some somewhat heated discussion on DSLreports about that. This isn't the final network yet, it's technically just being tested, but Google is supposed to be showing us what 1Gbps looks like. I know what 1Gbps looks like. And this is not it. This is some extremely clever throttling. And it's false advertising to advertise 1Gbps but make it impossible to download that fast, even from servers that support those speeds.

Now, this brings me to another part of this extremely long post. Servers.

The average web server is sitting on a 100Mbps or 1Gbps line. Some people use 10Gbps servers, but 10Gbps lines and the SSDs and high-end SAS RAID arrays needed to drive that speed are expensive and rare. In addition, ratelimiting/QoS is employed on almost all servers, which allows many clients to connect at a slower speed, instead of providing 1Gbps to a single user and nothing to everyone else.

What does this mean (in plain english)? Most servers cannot deliver content at 1Gbps.

Netflix limits itself to around 5.4Mbps. Back in 2011, [they claimed a max of 4800Kbps (4.8Mbps)](http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/01/netflix-performance-on-top-isp-networks.html). Even if using all six or so streams a single account can simultaneously use, that's only 32.4Mbps.

Okay, what about YouTube, file-sharing sites, etc? I'm going to go log into my dedicated server, and give you guys some piping hot &amp; fresh results from some popular sites.

Mediafire download: [2.8MB/s](http://i.imgur.com/iks3D.png) / [23.1Mbps](http://i.imgur.com/qsMDt.png)

Just to confirm I'm not seeing network issues (offsite test!): http://www.speedtest.net/result/2180561014.png

YouTube (4K video): [6.8Mbps](http://i.imgur.com/iAKgh.png)

Now, that's actually inaccurate. It burst up to about 25Mbps, then died. I've seen 40Mbps from it once, usually around 20-30Mbps, and a possible burst of 70Mbps a month or two ago. However, my point is, YouTube isn't even showing speeds to me that would saturate a 100Mbps line. Not very impressive at all.

Of course, if we're looking at large files.. Sooner or later the question will be about torrents. Now those can and will saturate a good portion of the line. Since my provider isn't exactly pirate-friendly, I'm going to download a well-seeded CentOS ISO file.

As you can see in the above screenshots, it started out slow-ish (25MB/s), and reached about 50MB/s (I saw just shy of 60MB/s, but didn't get a screenshot) at the peak. 

It is important to note that 8Mbps = 1MB/s. They are two separate units. Please don't confuse them. Also, Google is advertising 1Gbps, not the 1GB/s that some redditors I've seen think it is.

What have we established so far with these speedtests? Most servers cannot serve up or receive at 1Gbps. If you have more servers you would like me to test to, feel free to request something, and I'll do my best to deliver results.

After looking back at that all, I've realized that this post might be better suited for a tech blog, not /r/circlebroke, but I'll wait and see if this is or isn't a good place. Anyways, here's why Google Fiber is a big deal and redditors are obsessing about nothing. Maybe somebody will find it informative, maybe this will explain why I feel so annoyed about the hype over something that doesn't deserve it. Is 1Gbps FTTH cool? Sure. Is it a service that's worth it? Probably not. Is it good that kansas city ISPs have competition? Yes. Is this going to change anything for other ISPs in the country? No.

So there's my ~1100 words on the subject ;) I left out a bunch of stuff that's too technical or not interesting enough, so this is a bit trimmed down from what I was planning. This is more of a complaint about redditor's Google Fiber than reddit itself, so mods, if you don't think I'm whining about redditors specifically, please remove this post, and I'll repost it somewhere else.",Approved Novel,False,,t5_2tnz9,1347694301.0,,,True,t3_zwwjm,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/zwwjm/reddits_irrational_obsession_with_google_fiber/,

Do you think Jesus, a person that many would consider the most loved and influential individual of all time, is overrated? That's an inadequate answer.

Do you think sports players are unworthy of all of their adoration? Clearly this paragraph describes you:

&gt; At +53. DAE never got picked in gym and hate that people make a living out of sport, sport sucks! And the media, fuck them they've gone and glorified something, that media brainwashes everybody except us hey? And they're obviously ""brutes"" because that football player who dated that hot girl who never noticed me was a jerk and it's not like, you know, they're just normal people who happen to be talented footballers (the game here, in case wondering is Australian Rules Football, I'm Australian) Then after that do they go get a STEM degree? No they work in a trade, as an electrician pfft what a useless job for unskilled people.

Do you think people that are famous for being famous are overrated? Your 'bravery is reaching new levels'.

Do you find it upsetting that someone known for ripping off other musicians is as famous as he is? Clearly you only dislike him because

&gt; +160. The fact he gives away lots of money to charity is irrelevant when he's making fucking chart music amirite? DAE only listen to Queen and The Beatles

and any transgression you do can be wiped away by throwing money at it.

Do you think that the whitewashed version of Christopher Columbus taught in early schooling has caused people to believe that he was a better person than he was?

&gt; Second, there's the old anti-Christopher Columbus jerk. It's one of the more blatant examples of Reddit's second opinion bias. He's obviously not a perfect guy, but I think it's hard to see him as overrated - he discovered America for Europe. It's just classic 'read one book/reddit comment that went against my primary education, so my primary education is wrong.'

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; So how is he overrated? He discovered a whole fucking continent.

He's not overrated because he discovered America for Europe!

&gt; I get the point that most historical figures aren't saints and have done some bad stuff. Is it the point of studying history to just make moral and political judgements on everything? The majority of history is filled with brutality and all sorts of crazy stuff. Does that make their part in history any less significant. It's important to recognize that part, but to make that the singular point of focus is overboard as well.

We aren't allowed to judge whether or not we view people as overrated in the context of history!

Of course, when circlebroke deigns to list who they think is most overrated, amongst many joke answers (similar to the topic that they're lambasting, interestingly) are nestled such timelessly overrated figures as 'Macklemore' or 'Louis CK'.

Just yet another example of reddit's dreaded second option bias.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_1e8ene,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1e8ene/confronted_with_a_slew_of_opinions_reddit_feels/,

&gt;Hitler's entire crusade was set forth by Martin Luther himself...  If you have evidence to the contrary, or sources/citations for where you claim he was not religious, or that WWII was not a modern day Christian crusade, please, feel free to rewrite the history books.

How do our logical overlords respond?

&gt;The pogroms by the German church against the Jews and some other minorities were fairly common, Hitler industrialized them.

_________

&gt;Don't worry about showing anyone of ""faith"" this. The minute they start to think that Hitler was doing this with religious intent is the day they start becoming a holocaust denier. ""What? A Christian acted this way? Must not have happened then."" After that, point to the parts where God kills millions for the heck of it in the bible.

____________

&gt;My brother is in politics (though not a public figure himself). He uses religion. It is like a handle you can pretty easily (and cheaply) grab onto and twist, and the people react predictably. It makes large groups very manipulable, since they all have the same not-well-considered thoughts (if that word is appropriate) running around between their ears.

&gt;In short, when people decide to turn off a portion of their brain, it is not too surprising that other people will jump in and use it for them. This is not new.

&gt;lousy education= easily ruled people.. (specially if you keep them superstitious and fearful of others.)

_____________________________________

&gt;I think this sums up the primary issue most atheists have against established religion (aside from not believing it to be true), which is: people who affiliate themselves with organized religion are either being duped into following something that they haven't really thought through logically, or they are just totally full of shit and using the drooling idiots by the nose for their own advantage.

&gt;Famous bullshitter / apologist / convicted tax fraud Kent Hovind came to a debate at my college. I confronted him before the show about his despicable use in a video of a swastika and scary red and black colors for the ""atheist"" side of the screen compared to cross and blue colors for the Christian column. He waved me off, saying he had to prepare for the show and I let it go. After the debate, some of us got in his face to challenge the extraordinary crap he had just presented. We were demolishing him with reason and good questions when Hovind gets desperate and blurts out, ""Well, Hitler was an atheist."" My buddy says, ""No, he was a Christian,"" at which point Hovind says, ""Well, I gotta go!"" and immediately beelines out of the building. Seeing this conman in person was one of the last nails in the coffin for my religious leanings.

(He forgot the part where he leaped onto the stage and debated Hovind right there to the wild cheers of the audience.)

&gt;I got into an argument with my overly-Religious uncle (its almost to the point that he's in a cult) because he was very adamant that all Muslims are ""Satan's minions"" because of 9-11 and I responded with ""and Hitler was a Catholic but you don't see me calling Catholics Nazi's"" so I then proceeded to show him endless amounts of evidence about how Hitler was, in fact, a Devout Catholic. He would absolutely not listen to anything i said and our conversation degraded into him quoting the Bible and gospel verses. Just goes to show you how little ground these people have to stand on while arguing.

Anyway this is where I add my two cents right? What's really upsetting me is that nobody in any of these threads, especially the heavier confessions (we'll assume that they're all real even though a few of them are most certainly not), didn't tell the OP to go through the proper channels and seek professional help. It really sounds like we have some troubled spirits here on reddit and it pains me to see how they think reddit is the proper avenue for airing their issues. For example, in the thread with the OP who was abused by his father and subsequently beat him up, people were congratulating him. **NO REDDIT, THAT IS NOT THE PROPER RESPONSE.** I appreciate that they're just trying to reach out to a fellow person but they should really be telling him to seek help; telling him that it's nothing to be ashamed of. Didn't we just have this talk about expanding mental health care to all individuals? Oh wait, that was just when people were threatening to take away your video games. Guess it's back to business as usual.

Other than that, you can basically tell from the title of each link what kinds of 'jerks abound. There's even a separate CB post right now for the ""I beat up my friend's rapist"" confession bear.

The popularity of the two individually as well as their obvious chemistry as friends and performers quickly grew the channel to over 500,000 subscribers and, of course, a subreddit was spawned for discussion and all kinds of fan content. Really, for all the usual pitfalls of such a small, focused subreddit, it has, generally, been a very enjoyable place for all Grumps-related entertainment.

Recently, however, the Game Grumps posted [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yr0KUculTZA&amp;list=UU9CuvdOVfMPvKCiwdGKL3cQ&amp;index=1) of them playing the Dead Space 3 demo. This was a bit of a deviation from the norm for the Grumps, who tend to stick to older games, and when they do venture into newer games, they were never demos, and typically either games one (or both) really wanted to play, they were sent by fans, or continued a running ""theme"" (see: Kirby Return to Dreamland and Donkey Kong Country Returns.)

This, combined with the fact that a number of other video game related YouTube channels had posted similar videos on the same day, lead to many to suspect that the Grumps had ""sold out"" or were otherwise sponsored by EA to produce this video.

Of the two main jerks possible here (Screw EA! and a hipster variant “They used to be cool but then they sold out,”) neither really rears its head. Instead, the power of the Small Subreddit (currently under 20,000 subscribers) kicks in, and instead we see any and all opinions remotely negative toward the video downvoted, and downvoted hard while the “Our preferred entertainment venue can do no wrong” jerk kicks into full swing.

On the front page, there are, at the time of writing, no [fewer]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/16ocpz/wuzzat_you_didnt_like_the_dead_space_review/) [than]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/16o02u/max_tells_it_how_it_is_dead_space_3_episode/) [four]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/16mu12/i_personally_loved_the_dead_space_episode_but/) [posts]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/16nedh/just_a_quick_psa_about_youtube_lets_play_series/) specifically calling out detractors of the video. The number of posts saying anything *negative* about the video? Zero. 

Huh. Four separate posts to address opinions that seem to be entirely contained in comments (both YouTube and Reddit.) We’re in for a looooong ride, aren’t we?

Might as well start with the post for the [video itself]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/16m8s5/dead_space_3_game_grumps/).
Top comment?
&gt;That is some dang-ass hilarious bird animation. (180|16)


Ah, a Game Grumps meme (dang-ass, that is) referencing something in the video. Fair enough. Let’s find some of those negative opinions the other posts are up in a tizzy about.
&gt;I'll probably be skipping any further ""Sponsored Grumps."" I'm all in favor of them making money, and if this helps them out, then hey, more power to them. I just probably won't watch those videos.
&gt;It hurts the illusion, imo. There's something to that sense of ""camaraderie"" with the Grumps when they just sit down like ""hey watch us play this game"" that gets lost when it changes to ""watch us advertise this game."" (16|22)


… huh? That seems entirely reasonable. What else have they downvoted here?
&gt;I feel uncomfortable watching this.
&gt;And don't tell me to get over it, because I really just can't by snapping my fingers.
&gt;I like this channel because how real it was (aside from some censoring), but this + the t-shirt money grabs makes me feel like they think I'm just a brainless consumer who solely exists to give them money.
&gt;It just makes me uncomfortable and I don't have fun watching. If you don't agree, sorry, downvote arrow is to the left.
&gt;In no way do I feel bitter or judgmental, I woulda said yes to free dosh too. I'm just saying if this continues I'm just going to skip over these kinds of videos. (15|36)


Another reasonably expressed opinion that just happens to not be a fan of this direction of videos. Maybe all the downvotes are for the “downvotes to the left” comment.

And honestly? That’s… it. Those are the people angriest about the video. Maybe the other posts will reveal what everybody’s upset about.


[This]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/16mu12/i_personally_loved_the_dead_space_episode_but/) post specifically asks for dissenting opnions, and why people hold them. Surely this will be a source of good discussion, where even the negative opinions are given the merit they deserve! Let’s see what’s at the top. Perhaps a well-reasoned, level-headed explanation of the problems they had with the video?
&gt;My whole family was pecked to death by a raging gaggle of black bellied budapests. (116|6)


Oops, nope. Just a joke from the video. Should’ve figured. Let’s find the highest dissenting opinion in the post, then, shall we? Get to the meat of it all.

Here’s one, finally. 

&gt;Reposted from elsewhere, but I'm determined to get my point across without it getting downvoted to hell;

&gt;The major problem I see about this is that it erodes the sense of fan trust with the Grumps as a product. Up until this point it has essentially be a ride between us as the audience, and Arin/Jon/Barry as the Grumps.

&gt;Now, however, there is a much larger company that is effectively attached to this video. In itself this company is known for being an amorphous entity, and is often seen as an unfeeling, profit-centric corporation. EA being EA, between their business practices and their history, are de facto ""enemies"" of most gamers, especially the ones most likely to watch something like Game Grumps.

&gt;This in itself sets a worrying precedence (and I would argue rightfully so), of an erosion of what many people enjoy about the GG product. If this turns into the first of many publisher sponsored playthroughs, we will begin to see less output directed towards what we as an audience have enjoyed, and more towards products we may not be. In effect, we don't want our advertising in our GG thankyouverymuch.

&gt;This would have been a lot more sensible if the game in question was something like an indie game. It would allow less well-advertised games to be seen by the general public (let's be honest, who doesn't know about DS3 at this point?), keep trust in the GG brand and allow for additional revenue to Jon and Arin.

&gt;In short, people are annoyed because they like GG for a reason, and see the intervention of a company like EA as an erosion of these reasons. That is not to say that GG will become a shilling channel for the latest games, but were it to continue we could see monthly corporate sponsored game playthroughs become the norm rather than the exception. GG would do much better to target smaller independents to highlight as it would achieve the same effect as this video without the harsh stigma of a conglomerate like EA looming over them.

Sitting buried some pages down at (38|19), an admittedly restrained score given some others we’ve seen so far, sits the first person presenting the reasons he, personally, didn’t like the video. What’s voted above him, you ask? Lots, and lots of people praising the video, as well as people *guessing* at why other people might not like the video, THEN praising it.

The thing is? I’m having a REALLY hard time finding the opinions of people that *actually* had a problem with this video. I finally found another waaaaaaaay at the bottom of the comments
&gt;Because it felt fake and forced. (12|23)

-11 for that? For an opinion that is *actually relevant to the question that was asked*? And those are… it? What are the other two posts going on about then?

Alright, let’s check [one more]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/16ocpz/wuzzat_you_didnt_like_the_dead_space_review/) post then. (333|60)

It’s a meme post, calling out all those dastardly dudes who didn’t like the video for how little everyone cares about their opinion. Fair enough. 

Let’s see what’s hidden due to downvotes.

&gt;Wuzzat? You liked the Dead Space episode?
&gt;People care about as much. (9|14)

Sarcastic, maybe. Mean, perhaps, but it does nothing but flip the post’s point around. Doesn’t seem nearly as acceptable as not caring about people who dislike it.

&gt; What's that, you feel so threatened by people with different opinions that you have to make a shitty image macro to tell them to go away? (14|19)

The jerk doesn’t like being called out, it seems.

I guess no one will be really surprised that a smaller, focused subreddit will be circlejerky regarding source material, but it truly becomes bizarre when the jerk is against people holding opinions that seem to be imaginary. They have invented people to hate, invited them to share their opinions, then ensured those opinions will never be seen by people who aren’t specifically looking for them.

Reddit uses this opportunity to jerk about Chicago politicians, people supporting a candidate for reasons redditors wouldn't, and Obama. 

In response to an Illinois resident saying that voters knew Jackson was guilty and it just took time to gather evidence: 

[Your state loves to put out corrupt politicians. Is there something in the water?](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1kcf8f/former_illinois_congressman_jesse_l_jackson_jr_is/cbnkpg0) [+20]

In response to this euphoric question, a redditor decides to point out that a state that goes after its corrupt politicians is going to be in the news for having corrupt politicians more than one that doesn't. 

[It's probably more like Illinois actually goes after corruption.](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1kcf8f/former_illinois_congressman_jesse_l_jackson_jr_is/cbnlaxv) 

Does reddit accept this logical explanation? Of course not. [-4]. Okay, so commonsense explanations for things are a no-go. How about jerking over straw-voters? You betcha. 

[It's stupid voters who don't know shit going to the poll because he's ""a Jackson"" or ""he's black"" or ""he's a democrat"". Same goes for all the other politicians in our state. Our state is pathetic. In my own area the voters voted for a woman who stole a million dollars and not only once but twice. It's pathetic.](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1kcf8f/former_illinois_congressman_jesse_l_jackson_jr_is/cbnmlv5) [+9]

DAE black people aren't voting right??? Because you should definitely support someone you disagree with ideologically over someone whose moral character you may find subpar. 

Of course, where racial and political jerks intersect like this it's only a matter of time before [le]terally satan Obama comes up. 

[its not just the state of illinois, the American people elected a Chicago politician to America's highest political office... twice. ](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1kcf8f/former_illinois_congressman_jesse_l_jackson_jr_is/cbnmavl) [+8]

In which reddit is reduced to using Fox News dogwhistle language to voice their distaste for Obama. 

Reddit loves to beat dead horses, so another user chimes in with [""did u know Obama was one too?""](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1kcf8f/former_illinois_congressman_jesse_l_jackson_jr_is/cbnlm87) 

The bravery starts reaching a critical mass at this point. A response to that comment reads: 

[Downvotes for pointing out that Obama is just another corrupt IL politician.

Later down in the thread, someone points out that at least Illinois sends its corrupt politicians to prison ([Meh. It's a bit embarrassing, but at least we send our corrupt politicians to jail.](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1kcf8f/former_illinois_congressman_jesse_l_jackson_jr_is/cbnke63)) He doesn't suffer mass downvotes, but his comment does serve as the launching pad for peak bravery levels:

[Or they become president. ](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1kcf8f/former_illinois_congressman_jesse_l_jackson_jr_is/cbnkkeo) [+32]

You know, I'm really thinking reddit doesn't understand what ""corruption"" means. One commenter shares my doubts, as well as my bravery diagnosis: 

[Obama's corrupt? So brave.](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1kcf8f/former_illinois_congressman_jesse_l_jackson_jr_is/cbnlr61)

I'm probably a masochist.

This subreddit's islamophobia has been pointed out on circlebroke many times (most recently [two days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1eurad/rnews_and_rworldnews_goes_on_islamaphobic_field/)), but [this /r/worldnews-post](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/) and its comments made my brain weep in agony, so I guess it won't hurt to point it out one more time.

The linked article (which *astonishingly* was submitted by one of the moderators of /r/niggers, if this brief remark is allowed) deals with the violent riots against racial inequality in the labour market which currently happen in Stockholm; most of the rioters are muslim immigrants.    
The article has some very obvious issues, contradicts itself a few times and is in no way obective. Surely the deeply logical reasonable scientist redditors will notice those journalistic defiencies and point them out in the comments, right?    
Of course not.

The [top comment at this time](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5jym5) (+202) is some unbelievably dumb /pol/ copypasta:

&gt;Why are you so racist against these poor innocent Islamic 'youths'? It is a part of their culture to rape, steal, loot and riot. 

&gt;Not allowing them to exercise their cultural and religious beliefs is racist. 

&gt;Don't you embrace multiculturalism anon?

&gt;Don't you embrace diversity?

&gt;I think all women should start wearing Burqas as a sign of solidarity with them. It really is offensive to their beliefs if you do not. Why would you intentionally offend them by not covering your head as a sign of respect? 

Yeah, because violent riots for equal opportunities are *totally* part of muslim culture and religion, therefore this comment is *extremely* relevant to the article, right? It's basically the same thing as forcing your religion on other people and making them wear burkas, isn't it? The other comments in this thread are equally insightful: 

&gt;It warms my heart to see how r/worldnews is slowly becoming /pol/, a place where discussion can flow without being hindered by the PC bullshit. [\(+31\)](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5p3ls)

Hurr durr everyone who calls out ignorance and racism is a brainwashed PC-idiot and has no right to have an own opinion. Yawn.    
Let's take a look at other comment threads:

&gt;They don't want to integrate with you, they want you to integrate with them. [\(+199\)](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5lkeq)
&gt;&gt;Of course they want us to integrate with them. That is what their whole religion, nay culture is but a missionary based work. They kill apostates and atheists alike, go to war against their Abrahamic brothers \(Christianity, Judaism\) alike. The apologist will say that this is the ""minority"" that is doing it, which I would proceed in calling out their deception by asking, ""why haven't the ""majority"" spoken out against them?"" It is essentially giving silent consent to the more militant members. If it is a minority then why must they oppress their women and mutilate their female's genitalia (granted we still to this day perform circumcision)? Furthermore why must it always be immigrants from third world hellholes that do riots or think that they ""need"" (read:leech) welfare. They actively exploit Europe's more socialist governmental policies as a sort of career. In summation they need to integrate or get out of their respective host countries. [\(+70\)](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5nqqq)

Did this fucker even read the article? The immigrants are rioting AGAINST unemployment, which means that they do NOT want to depend on the welfare system anymore. The riots have nothing to do with missionary work or spreading muslim beliefs. Furthermore, many muslims *did* speak out against the violence of other rioters.

Most of the other top comments are of similar content (""Time to call in the Kebab removal unit"" [\(+91\)](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5hyz0)) or *hilarious* calculus puns. Let's see how far we have to scroll until we find somebody [who actually calls out the article for its lack of obectivity:](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5mtuu)

&gt;Let's consider some of the brilliant work put forth by Gerolf Annemans (the visionary quoted by this article), and the political party Vlaams Belang of which he is the parliamentary leader.

&gt;Vlaams Belang is a far-right conservative Flemish political party, formerly known as Vlaams Blok before 2004. The party changed names after a trial which condemned it as explicitly racist. For instance in 2001, Roland Raes (former VP of the party) expressed doubt about whether or not the Nazis killed as many Jews as the prevailing history claims they did, and went so far as to explicitly question the validity of Anne Frank's Diary.

&gt;Now that Islamophobia has replaced anti-semitism as the fashionable form of European racism, recently Vlaams Belang has focused primarily on speaking out against all things Muslim.

&gt;As for Annemans' individual contributions: he co-wrote the so-called ""70 point plan"", which has been universally denounced by human rights organizations in and outside of Belgium as ""a strategy of aggressive expulsion in order to create a mono-ethnic state"" (the Belgian Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism). But then again, Annemans doesn't claim to give two shits about human rights:

&gt;""The Vlaams Blok indeed does not feel bound by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This UN-declaration was written together with people from Senegal and Côte d'Ivoire. Here in Borgerhout [sub-urb of Antwerp ], we don't have to take that into account.""

&gt;All of this information is not disputed and is freely and readily available on Wikipedia, for instance.

&gt;Let's just conclude this little PSA by noting how eerily similar some of the comments on this post (and more broadly in this sub and on Reddit) are to the comments made by Annemans and company regarding Muslims and Islam. Not to mention the fact that by linking to articles like this, you're parroting this racist bullshit. I'm not saying that the riots are justified, but you need to understand who you're all starting to sound like.

An insightful comment providing context and background information as well as encouraging critical thinking will surely be upvoted by reddit's self-proclaimed scientists, right? Nope, its hovering between a (-6) and (-9) everytime I check, while the smug reply [""Well these rioting muslim youths are not helping their cause""](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5myu) is always between (+10) and (+12). There are some other comments calling out the source of the article who aren't downvoted as badly ([here](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5ohcx) and [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5oy5r) for example), but according to RES they all have a very low upvote-to-downvote-ratio (eg. 9 upvotes, 7 downvotes) which implies that a lot of the islamophobes downvote any fact which doesn't fit in their worldview. The same thing happens to [redditors who point out](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5nqx6) that many others are ""blowing it [=the situation] out of proportion"" and that, in their opinion, the issue is more a socio-economic problem than a race/religion one. 

I'll end this post by quoting a few other le racist gems:

&gt;The ones that aren't using violence prefer breeding and beating naive Europeans at the polls until they can vote in their own theocracy. [\(+3\)](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f06hv/they_dont_want_to_integrate_fifth_night_of_youth/ca5q2yl)

The OP's statement itself isn't very jerky, what gets me are the stale jokes in the comments implying that his wife is cheating. Because nobody ever goes for 2 months without sleeping with their spouse unless they're getting some from somewhere else.

What's reddit's advice?

&gt;You should comment and say its her fault.

Just lovely.

&gt;He should say he was thinking about her sister. 

So edgy.

But what really convinced me to post this here is the 'D' jerk. You know, that super original funny joke about women ""wanting the D""

&gt;I have some bad news. She's getting the D from someone else.

Then, the relationship experts of reddit offer the first sage advice in the entire thread.

But surely the next comment will be some non-jerky wisdom, right?

What a fucking shock in an article about the FBI conducting a major sting against pedophiles on the internet the current top comment is:

&gt;As big a scourge that CP is, somehow I don't think having the FBI act as one of the largest distributors of said garbage is a good idea.


From there we have plenty more brilliant insights such as

&gt;With that reverse aging software they could have avoided this, but I guess it is ok for law enforcement to sleep with prostitutes and distribute child porn, because they are the good guys.

and 

&gt;I agree. I think there would have to be a better way then putting it out there like that. Those are someone's pictures. Probably an adult now, how would they feel knowing that their pictures, which were recovered, helping them move on, was purposely being used by the same people who swore to protect them. Ehh just my 2cents.

and

&gt;I agree with you. If the FBI were distributing cocaine only to tag and bag their customers, people'd be upset. I don't think it should be any different, even if the very thought of child pornography is disturbing.


Of course, all ignoring the actual article that said they DIDN'T make this site, they busted the owners and took control of it to observe their user base!

Beyond that we have a ton of ""THIS IS JUST LIKE FAST AND FURIOUS!"" stuff coming in and more retelling of the same 'man the FBI is just as bad as pedos man' bullshit.

Also one of my favorite new posts

&gt;The thing that bothers me is that the FBI isn't saying ""Hey! We teamed up with the families of some abused kids. It was a brave move and we were able to stop blah blah blah.""
It seems like they just did it, and guessed nobody would mind that they were doing something crazy fucked up.
What if they didn't catch everybody involved? What if they just let some dude download a bunch of child porn?

&gt; They can really only prosecute you if you were taking a test for licensure, or you were taking a test for someone else (fraud).
That said, if you ever got caught cheating, just sue. ... So if you get caught, you just sue saying that if a school trusted you enough to be a student, they legally have to trust you to cheat on an exam if you want without checking.

1360905080.0,115,self.circlebroke,18kdqk,"Reddit's world is black and white, and if you aren't on the right side, you are on the wrong side. For every single issue.",jamie_byron_dean,139,24,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/18kdqk/reddits_world_is_black_and_white_and_if_you_arent/,"This is not a new trend, but a few issues in the last week or so have really brought this issue to the fore for me.

Whatever you may think about the world, one thing is clear: the world is a nuanced place.

And although many people will proudly proclaim that ""nothing is black and white,"" that doesn't seem to stop them from from reducing every single issue into a black and white dichotomy.

Both the Dorner case and the recent Tesla/NYT debacle are the two shiniest examples of this. I'm sure most of you have seen what I'm talking about.

Watching drama unfold and being intrigued is one thing - you are allowed to be interested in anything you want, and frankly almost everything dramatic is interesting in some way. So I'm not picking on people for giving attention to these issues (although the Tesla/NYT thing is, in my not-humble opinion, pretty overblown).

But it is absolutely unfathomable to me why people - in this case, obviously, Redditors - feel such an innate need to:

1. Invent 2 distinct sides.
2. Take a side.
3. Act indignant and righteous in favor of their side.

It's possible to read an article about an event without splitting the issue right down the middle. Isn't it? 

But even if these dichotomies were absolutely genuine, why the *hell* do Redditors immediately take sides? Especially in issues they have no direct involvement in, no objective source of information of, no professional or academic authority in, and usually no life experience regarding the issues at hand. Not every single issue in the world needs champions to defend it, and they definitely don't need Redditors to be those champions. Why is it impossible for Redditors to observe a situation without making gut decisions off a 3-second headline, brandishing their pitchforks, and then marching off to battle? In a website whose base is so proudly Atheist, why do they reduce the world into God vs. the Devil fictionalizations? 

I'm too tired to really get into this, and since it's Friday on the Eastern seaboard I'll chalk it up to LEF. But browsing through links regarding both these issues - Dorner and Tesla - will make it evident how Reddit loves to make up rigid dichotomies and stick to them, and then act like their side is the only side and everyone else is evil and part of the great American injustice machine (BIG OIL SHILL! CORRUPT MURDEROUS LAPD! CRAZY MANIAC! INCOMPETENT DRIVER!)

[Here's an /r/bestof post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/18ipuq/cikedo_answers_an_eli5_about_the_dorner_case/) that tries to give credit to someone for ""breaking the issue down into the two sides,"" in which the top comment is someone breaking down the illusion that there *are* two sides to begin with. Clearly, I agree with this commenter (inb4 I'm taking sides). This might give you an idea of the phenomena I'm describing, if you don't have one already.

As for the Tesla stuff... it's even worse, really, because the information is so unclear on both sides and both parties have clear vested interests in proving the other ones wrong (at least, Musk does - whatever Brodan's interests are is unclear, although apparently he's a shill for Big Oil so there you go), and also because it's so borderline a non-issue anyway. Shit can happen without a hero and a villain being involved. Can't we at least wait for a neutral, after-the-fact arbiter to assess the information reliably and objectively before committing ourselves to a cause and fighting to the death for it? Why does it have to be One or the Other, Us or Them, Right or Wrong? 

I don't know. This post isn't very good. Maybe someone can do a better job of it then me. I've grown weary of wading through P, ~P rhetoric all day in every single thread of every single issue that arises. Situations can arise in the universe without being evenly split down the middle into ""good"" vs. ""evil.""

You see it a lot on a micro level, too. People try to justify something like r/jailbait with some little caveat that suddenly makes it a black/white issue where they are right, because of some little caveat that somehow overrules everything else. Nothing is grey... If you are white and were denied a job, it is because of racial discrimination. If you like a girl who does not return the interest, it is because she's a friendzoning bitch. If someone says a prayer, it's because they are deluded fundie idiots. Everything is hyperbolized to one of two binary extremes, and those extremes are in existential opposition to each other. 

I'll try to dig up more specific examples in the morning.

The main thing that gets me riled up about /r/atheism is their stupid fucking obsession with [drawing Muhammad.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zxne1/lets_see_how_many_people_can_draw_muhammad_ill/)

First of all, I want to address the whole ""if it doesn't offend me it isn't offensive"" attitude on the sub. These are the same people who throw a shitfit if someone says ""thank god"" after surviving cancer, and they are intentionally doing one of the most offensive things possible to 1/4 of the world. I know that some of the reactions of extremist muslims can be, well, extreme, but that does not warrant pulling this shit. 

Secondly, what exactly are they trying to accomplish. ""Look at this picture of Muhammad sucking his own dick! We showed you, terrorists!"". ""Wow I hated america before but a 14 year old re-creating the very thing I am offended about really changed my opinion"" said no one ever. Are they trying to restore peace to the middle east by doing this? Are they just trying to make EVERY muslim angry? Are they just doing it to be edgy? What is your motive, /r/atheism!!!!

Here's a [great idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zxn9q/hey_r_atheism_i_think_we_should_make_more_videos/) coming from another user. Gee, what a great fucking idea! What a twat. 

And [another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zxbcf/dear_crazy_fervent_muslims_you_really_showed_the/c68imgl), slightly less offensive than draw Muhammad, but still over the full retard threshold.  

Another thing /r/atheism loves to do is spread their vast knowledge of the middle east. They love to talk about what a shithole the entire region is. [The cities are trash](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zxbcf/dear_crazy_fervent_muslims_you_really_showed_the/c68n8mr), and the region is a backwards third world. [Apparently having been to an airport in one country qualifies you to generalize an entire region.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yg0bv/reddit_what_is_the_worst_city_that_you_have_ever/c5vaq76)
Ratheists also know almost nothing about the religion they insult. As [seen here](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zt8rd/my_first_facebook_rebuttal_to_a_post_by_a_fundie/), they do not know that Islam is a judeo-christian religion. Somewhat related [this picture depicting Jesus as an Arab, accompanied by the title ""why don't fundies realize that jesus was an Arab"" that is popular on the sub](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_GOUAO0qWKsk/TCkbP6gub3I/AAAAAAAAAXQ/wHFc7Di6f7U/s1600/Jesus-Christ%2525252Bfrom%2525252BShroud.jpg) is just straight up wrong. In all likelihood, Jesus was of Israelite descent. 

I know that Islam seen as shit to them because fundies, but I think a lot of their immaturity can be attributed to straight up racism. The animosity displayed towards the region and its inhabitants is rivaled only by stormfront. I can't completely tell what this guy is trying to say, [but it sounds like he is advocating genocide](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zx392/so_my_staunchly_christian_father_asked_me_about/c68j6y4). [This guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/zx392/so_my_staunchly_christian_father_asked_me_about/c68j6y4) thinks that all fundies are either delusional or stupid.

I'm just pissed that such a large group of people can be such douchebags about a subject they know nothing about.

&gt; Just a bit under a year ago the a good portion of the internet was migrating and boycotting Go Daddy ... due to Go Daddie's [sic] support of SOPA and it's later attempts to weasel out of taking responsibility for supporting it. 

&gt; What happened? Now Go Daddy is advertising on Reddit - I'm sure people are buying their service through the ads... WTF Reddit, does the hivemind really have that short of a memory?

Well, a.) yes and b.) goddamn, this makes it so obvious that Redditors don't really understand the point of a boycott and just want to destroy companies that have ever broken with the hivemind.

For example, did you know:

&gt; ""[the ideal boycott for a company that doesn't bend over backwards to reverse some harmful effect ... is one that drives them out of business. That lesson isn't for them, it's for other businesses to fill the vacuum of their collapse and do it right this time...](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z2rhj/just_a_few_months_ago_reddit_was_boycotting_go/c61076w)""

In other words, if your company has ever fucked up, even if you reversed the fuck-up, you deserve to burn in hell. Why would they think this? Because Redditors are incaple of actual contrition.

&gt; ""[It's like when you were a kid and your parents made you apologize...you didn't meant it and only did it to keep out of trouble.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z2rhj/just_a_few_months_ago_reddit_was_boycotting_go/c610dst)""

[](/OhGodItsALineBreak)

&gt; ""[They 'changed their position' by telling us they changed their position and continuing to support it anyway.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z2rhj/just_a_few_months_ago_reddit_was_boycotting_go/c60zxen)""

No apology is ever real. Gosh, Redditors are just so cynical, it must be because they're so _smart_! But at least someone gets it (at least I hope so, being Reddit this person might be serious):

&gt; ""[That's why I advocate infanticide as the only method of discipline.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z2rhj/just_a_few_months_ago_reddit_was_boycotting_go/c610mh3)""

So why does Reddit think boycotts should last forever? Might have something to do with not understanding the economy:

&gt; ""[It is not gains but losses that drives the economy forward. Gains are of course necessary as an incentive and because without gains, there can be no losses.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z2rhj/just_a_few_months_ago_reddit_was_boycotting_go/c610pc9)""

How can we make Redditors understand this concept? (Poorly) connect it to (bad) science, of course!

&gt; ""It's pretty much like evolution. Someone comes up with something and ""mutates"" their company. If that mutation sucks, the company dies. If the mutation is good, the company has a higher survival rate.""

And then a Redditor admit he's effectively boycotting Reddit. I bet he complained when the site went down yesterday:

&gt; ""[Reddit has ads????](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z2rhj/just_a_few_months_ago_reddit_was_boycotting_go/c60yfno)""

  The woman ([Lucy Komisar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Komisar)) is clearly being heckled by the men in the background, but this doesn't do much to give her much sympathy from the redditors who are quick to make this a men's rights/arbitrary amendment issue.

  [This particular fellow](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryPorn/comments/16j8pe/after_116_years_of_prohibiting_them_mcsorleys_old/c7wlnu0) sympathizes wth the *men* in the picture, saying that he'd be ""pretty bummed"" too if he was in their situation. There's something special about hanging out with just dudes. This comment is currently the second-highest voted comment in the thread.

  The wonderful liberty of being able to bar people because of their gender is one that is enthusiastically defended by many other commenters.

  [This commenter](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryPorn/comments/16j8pe/after_116_years_of_prohibiting_them_mcsorleys_old/c7x1igf) bravely faces his own karma suicide (a rather mild one: 24 points, making his one of the highest-voted comments in the comments section) by suggesting that women should open a women's pub instead of complaining, and that it's a shame to ruin a 100 year old tradition. I wonder what other century-old practices are worth defending...

  One female redditor feels obliged to [ask](http://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryPorn/comments/16j8pe/after_116_years_of_prohibiting_them_mcsorleys_old/c7wut4r) if women are some kind of problem in a bar. The answer is generally polite. The problem lies not with the women, but with the men whose testosterone levels make them unable to act normally around women. The logic is not very different from that of more extreme Muslims whose main motivation for subjugation of women is the potential temptation they'd make for us poor men and our uncontrollable sexuality. Oh and did I mention her comment being currently at -3 points?

Today, in the soapbox of r/adviceanimals, [a smash hit of a post](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1i0b0j/my_coworker_tells_me_her_daughter_is_27_months_old/?sort=top) has done it again.

I want to play Civ, so let me try to keep this brief. 

Of all the things that reddit jerks off about, those that bother me the most are the ones that can be easily solved/dismissed/satisfied etc. with a simple explanation. In this case, the explanation is ""Infants are aged in months instead of years because it is more accurate developmentally, and all of the popular science/literature on infants parents are exposed to uses months instead of years."" That's really all there is to it. There is a *reason* for it, and it is a non-offensive and innocuous reason. 

(As an aside, here's the catch with rejecting month-convention. If you think babies should be aged in years and not months, you are ignoring the simple reason for the measure. Thus you are being arbitrary. But if month-conventions seem arbitrary, then year-conventions must be equally arbitrary. The question isn't why do we age toddlers in months, but why do we age adults in years? If you answer ""Well, aging by year is a well-established social convention..."" then you are also defending the argument for aging by month. In other words... No matter how you go about it, the ""proper"" way to give an organism's age is a non-issue.)

So this should be an open-and-shut case. Once a single redditor steps out and explains, ""Well, we do it like that, because that's how doctors and everyone does it, because important developments happen on a monthly or even weekly, not yearly, basis,"" everyone should either go, ""Okay, that still annoys me, but I'm arbitrary so it's not your fault,"" or, ""That makes a lot of sense I guess, it's a non-issue so I don't care."" Instead, everyone just repeats the same bone-headed objection, over and over, in many cases trying to use ""reason"" to prove why month-convention is stupid, despite being directly told - over and over - the *reason* month-convention is *not* stupid.

Here's a sample chain - the 2nd top comment. It's relatively civil, but it plays out like 100 other comment chains in the same thread, progressively less civil.

&gt;That pisses me off, as well. I can get 18 months. It's quicker and easier than saying a year and a half, but once they're two, they're fucking two.

&gt;&gt;It's because babies develop by the month, not by the year. Parents need to know the exact month of the baby for shots, and other important milestones. It normal to do this for 2-3 years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Great, but do you have to tell non-doctor coworkers their age in months?

Obnoxious comment. There's not really an answer to that, other than, ""No,"" or maybe, ""yes,"" because what kind of issue is this anyway?

The next comment basically says, ""Yes, because once again, development is fast at that age."" But no, no matter how many times this simple, non-intrusive, universal explanation is given it, it just does not fall on receptive ears. Next reply:

&gt;Okay. But most people don't give a shit about all that and are just asking to be polite.

This is like when redditors complain about how horrible their facebook feeds are. If you're in a situation like this and you somehow don't like it, it's not like you can't just get yourself out of the situation. In the case of facebook, it takes two to tango - if you don't like your feed, cultivate a different set of friends, and either take an interest in their daily activities or stop using facebook. In the case of baby ages, either don't ask in the first place, or do ask and understand the nature of the answer you will be given without getting pissed off about it. 

I just don't get the damn issue! It seems so adolescent! If you don't give a shit, then don't give a shit when they say ""22 months"" instead of ""2 years,"" and if you still want to be polite, then just give a shit! Fuck! 

After a point, people try to introduce reason into their rejection of month-convention, which makes the whole thing worse because, like I said, there *is* a reason, and it's not whatever arbitrary STEM-lord schema you personally care to develop.

&gt;I hadn't really thought about why it was annoying until now. Clearly it's something that bothers a lot of people and I think might be why: It comes off as very self-absorbed. Not only do most people not care about the exact level of your kid's development, but you're also telling them about it in kind of a jargon. Obviously dividing by 12 isn't that difficult and everyone should be able to figure it out, but it's presumptuous to assume that anyone will know/care about the difference between 16 and 17 months.

If someone asks you a question and you give a proper answer, you are literally **very* self-absorbed. Also, ""22 months"" is total fucking legalese elitist jargon, I can't even understand what you are saying, what are ""months?"" Speak ENGLISH!

And then the bit about dividing by 12 being presumptuous? Come again? You don't divide by twelve - that's the point. ""22 months"" isn't meant to be divided by 12.

And now, a fresh breath of realization from someone:

&gt;If you don't care about the difference between 16 and 17 months, why should you care about the difference between 1 and 2 years? Either you give a shit or you don't. If you don't, does it really matter what unit of measurement they used? Smile, nod, and move on.

&gt;&gt;I like this train of posting. I went into this also thinking ""yeah it is so annoying when I get told that"" and after seeing this back and forth, my thought is ""well, I guess I get what I pay for"" and we can all go back to enjoying our day. Thank you.

Wasn't that refreshing?

Onto the bone-headed horde of childfree anti-breeder anti-month-convention coworkers!

&gt;""He's almost two"" ""He just turned one"" ""He's one and a half""
All acceptable alternative answers that are relevant to most people. We get that there are big differences per month for a kid, but that question isn't usually designed to elicit data that can be extrapolated to determine the probability of your kid having reached some developmental milestone; it's probably just the person trying to be nice. Also, they probably don't actually give a fuck anyways.

BLOOP BLOOP EXTRAPOLATE DATA FUCK NOT GIVEN (If: then: goto 0 lolol)

&gt;But a person asking just to be polite doesn't give a shit about the exact month.

Blah blah blah. Please, tell us for the 100th time reddit, how much of a shit you don't give.

Another parent comment just reiterates the simple, unassuming reason why month-convention exists. Instead of accepting it, we get to go through again why its stupid, and how little of a shit we give.

&gt;Parents are assuming that people give a shit about all that stuff.

Oh, and here's this bonus comment:

&gt;Why was your first calculation on a 2 year old ""Oral""?
EDIT: Wow, not bad for my second post on here .^

When I read this comment a few hours ago, the comment score was +43. Now it's +49. Not only is this comment a ""OMG TOP RATED COMMENT ABOUT SEX LOL THANKS REDDIT WE DID IT,"" but it's over *49* points. What's gonna happen when this person gets 100? But now I'm just making fun of someone, I guess, so back to the topic...

&gt;The whole question is pointless and a waste of time, we're just trying to be polite.

FUCK YOU AND YOUR BABY, TOO. I'M POLITE AND YOU SUCK.

&gt;Those parents are just pretending to be interested so you'll talk to them about their crotch spawn, just like you did with this post in order to lead into you talking about your crotchspawn.

**DING DING DING**, ctrl+f ""crotchspawn,"" was not disappoint. 

&gt;The typical defense of parents is that there is a massive difference between a 24 month old and a 27 month old.
they fail to realize that no one actually gives a fuck, and we're just being polite asking how old their dumb crotchspawn is.

The first crotchspawn comment was negative-rated, but this one is a parent comment and is positive.

Followed swiftly by...

&gt;It's just a stupid fuck trophy.

----

I intended for this post to be fully about the jerk itself, how reddit just blithely barrels through an issue with no subtlety and repeats the same inanity without fail, like an unmoveable object refusing to step aside for an unstoppable force, but I may have veered into part of the jerk itself. There are as many comments in that thread repeating the exact same line of reasoning from parents, repeating the same single reason over and over, and I didn't quote from them - but what's the point? What else can they do, when there's a simple answer to give, but give it? 

This little wiseguy gets the picture.

&gt;Does this qualify as a circle jerk yet?
I mean childless people complain about the math
Parents complain about you asking if you get mad about how they keep track during the first few years

Looks like the jokes on me, though, because I just wasted half an hour of my life on this non-issue.

For once (praise Sagan) they've managed to take a break from jerking about Kim Dotcom and their right to piracy for an interesting topic, [coding being taught to children in elementary school](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/13tc64/coding_should_be_taught_in_elementary_schools/)

Now before we begin our ascent into the comments, lets take a look at the [article in question](http://venturebeat.com/2012/11/25/pixel-academy/). All it is is just a feature piece on a neat little startup called The Pixel Academy, who's focus is to get kids interested in programming/coding, and their fundraising to find a permanent home in NYC. Simple enough, nothing ""controversial"" about it, and to top it all off, 
##***nowhere remotely related to the title of the submission to r/technology.*** 

So now that we've hyped the masses with STEM pleasing sensationalism, its time to weed out who actually read the article versus people who just want to jerk over how learning a STEM skillset is better than meeting our Lord and Savior Neil DeGrasse Tyson.

First comment (+818|-154) attempts to make a valid point on the issue
&gt;Maybe I really should be dug down for it, but why push coding in elementary? Shouldn't it focus on the core subjects and let the child grow up? High Schools have electives for whatever someone wants to focus on.

I'll admit I agree with this, let elementary schools be sure that a student can read, write, and do math at a satisfactory level before introducing a skill set, that while valuable, has little real world application out side of CS

The comment then goes on to say how instead, elementary schools should focus on teaching about self image, healthy eating (which most do, to some extent) and money managing, all of which are taught later on, in middleschool and highschool, in fuller detail.

First child comment (475|111)
&gt;Because introduction to programming is not about programming as a job or even a hobby.
It is about getting a certain mindset to tackle problems in a efficent way.  
One could rather see it as applied logic and maths instead. It contains strict rules but it also grants a gratification if you follow those rules.    
Set up correctly, I think programming could help kids expand their interest in core subjects but it would be need to be tailored for it.
But in a day and age when schools basically competes for the attention of the kids it might not be a bad approach. And having some sort of formal early education on a thing that basically run the world by now is not bad either.

""Because it has the potential to help some understand math better, it's  more important to stuff another skillset into the classroom, instead of working to improve what is there already""

Further down, in between the ""DAE remember BASIC and LOGO?"" going on, comes a voice of reason (32|6)

&gt;I don't envy the schools dilemma in teaching a child, but there are a lot of tools (not just programming per se) that can help build a fundamental logic / approach to obstacles and challenges.  
Between physical puzzles, activities and games (focusing on problem solving/challenging a person) they could offer up some valid skill building as well.  
Now if there were themes/groups to have a child focus on as an option sure. Such as one group focusing on sports, another on math (programming in it), another etc.  
But I still feel elementary schools should focus on the core first, let the parents (hopefully) manage the child's attention outside of the class.  
Perhaps evolve the existing traditional classes to a more interactive logic/skill building than wrote memorizing from a book.  
I never liked how schools were often more about memorizing than natural/dynamic comprehension. Were applicable of course, you still have to know somethings!

Further down, the parent comment of another thread shines more light as to what should be focused on in elementary schools

&gt;No, discrete mathematics should. Programming is way to specific, discrete mathematics applies to everything (250|42)

I actually like this, a lot. while Programming does teach you some basics of discrete mathematics, it doesn't cover everything, especially the more algorithmic thinking behind it. Learning to analyze the information you have and what you need to find out in various situations has way more real-world applications compared to learning how to analyze it for use in code.

Moving on, we have a simple, albeit misguided, analogy voicing why it seems unnecessary

&gt;Coding should not be taught in elementary schools. Your bias is showing. Coding is not essential. It's not a life skill.
Do you think we should be teaching automobile maintenance in elementary school? There are many, many more people who drive than there are that write code.

Obviously coding and auto repair are far from essential life skills, sure they're both useful, but its like comparing apples to televisions. First child comment pretty much sums up the side that is for coding in schools
&gt;I have to disagree with you on this. I was taught coding in elementary (I'm 35), and it helped us understand logic, which is the basis for a large number of things: math, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, etc. It's not a life skill, but it helps teach a building block for a number of things that are.

""What's good for me is good for everyone""
&gt; Then why not teach logic? Serious question.

way easier solution to this problem, most teachers can explain simple logic to children, and no need for them to be trained, or yet have to hire more workers in a floundering market

&gt;The point is that teaching something like LOGO is fun 

What's fun for me is fun for everyone!

&gt;This is like saying kids should be taught accounting so that they can learn to add. Just fucking teach them to add.

&gt;Though accounting is probably applicable to everyone's life, so even that would be better than forcing everyone to learn programming.
If you want kids to learn logic, you should have them take an actual logic class. Then they can learn how to think logically, and knowing things they teach in logic class (like logical fallacies like the false dilemma you are presenting) is way more useful to everyone than knowing how to code.

This is the comment i'm choosing to end on, It sums up the main argument and offers somewhat of a better alternative than just slapping some programming classes in the middle of a curriculum designed to help teach children the basics they'll need for the rest of their life. If you're worried about children not learning logic, design a curriculum or activity that teaches it in a way that most will understand and enjoy. Going further down you'll see pretty much the same arguments ""Teach actual logic in a way most can understand instead of coding"" vs ""it has the potential to help some understand concepts better""

 I just want to clear up that while I do get excited when a child wants to learn programming or just Computer Science in general, forcing programming in schools is somewhat counter intuitive. There are easier ways to help struggling children improve problem-solving and mathematical comprehension without adding a complex layer of rules on top. If you want kids to get interested in coding, start them off with basic computer sciences. (eg: learning about hardware, software, and basic computer use) If they gain more interest then they can work outside of school to follow it, or if offered, take programming as an elective.

Let us begin with the [music of our circlejerk elders](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lKUYAnqxjU&amp;feature=relmfu) and remind ourselves of the wrath and appraisal of the hivemind. Allow me to begin with a prayer. 

*  *Reddit, I have never pandered to you before. I have no idea how to. No one, not even you, will remember if it was a good or bad idea. Why I thought of it, or why it died. All that matters is that idea stood against many. That's what's important! Bravery pleases you, Reddit... so grant me one request. Grant me revenge! And if you do not listen, then to HELL with you!*

In a time of waning site wide circlejerks we may refer to as the time of lore, great hydras had shown the ugly heads and no single moderator could muster up to the challenge of slaying any of them. The dark storm of our beginnings, the faces of Atheism, still loomed beyond our knowledge and all was peaceful. 

Many dark commercial deamons had been slain once before on the battle grounds of the front page, but this one, this one may have torn Reddit apart.

At first the creature flew in with great vigor and speed. The pure power of the post lured many fools into its grasp. The hivemind may have been doomed this day to seal in the evil that lurked. The perfect circlejerk had arrived and it possessed the 4 major hivemind sins. Women, Science, Video Games, and Sex. The battle was rough and at first the post had taken place at it's rightful spot on the top or /r/gaming. No single voice could muster up the strength to call out the OP with serious regard.

The first attempt begins as a [sly misogynistic remark](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p1ssv/dear_internet_im_a_26_year_old_lady_whos_been/c3lsugu) denying credibility because the OP is a woman. The first attack begins with the incredibility based upon gender. *Of course the pandering is obvious with gender*. Let us mock you for it. Yet this brave night was slain quick.

Soon enough, another attacked with their full force. Could they slay the beast based upon [strange sexual ideas](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p1ssv/dear_internet_im_a_26_year_old_lady_whos_been/c3lsxph)? The beast wiped him away with the help of Science^TM . Once again the OP had serious ideas and would not let the criticism of a [scalie](http://en.wikifur.com/wiki/Scalie) fetish deter her. 


A shining knight approached and the silver sword of biting scientific commentary. A critical [(comment) strike cut deep](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p1ssv/dear_internet_im_a_26_year_old_lady_whos_been/c3lswro). The beast raised its head and spewed out a storm of *evolution* which scorched the thread into a nonsensical joke where no further discussion could grow. A garden that had been salted. A weak plant that had been snuffed out by the soot and chaos of inane joke comments.


The lizard had taken enough. No Champion could reason through the hivemind and yet the post still stood with high. Only one bitter knight could take them on. Only one with the experience to set this post to rest.

Finally a fighter worthy of making a criticizing comment. The only hope in making any real commentary. A challenger who's blade was as keen as their (s)word. The battle raged long and hard. The hivemind had once upvoted the post onto the front page and yet would only be swayed to kill it when actual criticism began. As always, the tradition remains that a post may only be judged by it's top comments. Still the roars of ""that's why i always go to the comment section to see how the post is bullshit"" are deep rooted and may be one great evil that has ended the age of article reading in favor for memes, image macros, and other easy low quality content. 

It had ended almost as abruptly as it has started, and now only tales remain to sing of their stories. No one won that day.

If you take a few minutes to read through /r/worldnews, /r/politics, or, god forbid, /r/economics (but in reality almost every subreddit that could possibly have anything to do with anything slightly law-based), you'll often see posts that essentially instruct the legislature, executive, and judiciary on what they should do and how they should do it. The problem being that these people don't fucking understand legal processes in the first place. The most recent example (forgive the lack of source) was a comment that said that the head civil engineer on a US bridge project 40 years ago should be prosecuted for the bridge having collapsed a few years ago. Jesus H. Christ, notwithstanding the statute of limitations on that sort of thing, how is that at all *natural justice*? You know, that thing the entire western legal system is based on? That thing that /r/politics will provide countless unfounded assertions claiming that it exist?

Even leaving aside concepts that are open to interpretation, people still don't know what the fuck they're on about. A few months ago, a bunch of /r/politics redditors decided that they'd draft up some legislation to oppose the imposition of SOPA-like legislation and submit it to US Congress for consideration. My god, anyone that has any knowledge of legal process, or legislation itself, would've had a good laugh at that one. The pile of shit that passed through the sphincter of /r/politics on that day was a fucking travesty, and it was pointed out by a laywer who reached critical mass after everybody decided that this asinine, chicken-shit attempt at drafting legislation was actually a great idea, and had been structured and written beautifully. To top it all off, /r/politics and /r/law started trying to solicit *free* legal advice to get the document to a submission-ready state. Well, the aforementioned lawyer had a perfectly-justifiable shit-fit about that, tearing strips off both the legislative document and /r/politics and /r/law themselves for trying to get the free legal advice, despite having stated in the past that all lawyers are capitalist assholes (source: pretty much any /r/politics thread about lawyers). In Australia, we have a group called Parliamentary Counsel who draft legislation the way it's supposed to be written, because they're experts with years of experience. They also get paid a shit-tonne for doing this. Meanwhile, /r/politics and /r/law think they can waltz in with their piss-poor excuse for a legal document and get free instructions, guidance, and editing.

Don't even get me started on the people who breeze through threads saying ""Well, the judiciary *should* do this."" Firstly, these people wouldn't know criminal law if it kicked them in the fucking groin, and when they comment about sentencing? Well, let's just say that they've got about as much idea about sentencing legislation as a pre-schooler does about quantum physics. They throw out all sorts of suggestions, totally disregarding the reason that the government's judicial arm is independent (but then bringing back that idea of independence of judiciary when it allows them to attack Republicans and anyone else even slightly right-of-centre), and not even acknowledging the fact that there are strict rules for conviction and sentencing for every existing law. My favourite people, though, are the ones that say businessmen should be arrested on charges that don't exist, but then police arresting someone poor for stealing shit from a shop should be sacked.

Thank god the judiciary isn't a direct democracy, and thank god there's an unsubscribe button from /r/politics, /r/worldnews, and every other sensationalist subreddit whose members like to think they have some kind of sophisticated knowledge about complicated concepts and processes that they in fact know nothing about at all.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_vtx22,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vtx22/if_you_dont_properly_understand_the_legal_system/,

It’s got some anti-theism, some internet armchair activism (upvote to put this guy in his place) and a few other things. 

But I want to focus on a jerk I haven’t seen that particularly much. That people who were hard partyers in their teens and twenties who go on to settle down are big ol’ hypocrites. To be honest it isn’t the biggest jerk in the thread, but it’s one I haven’t noticed before and one I’d like to point out. 

Some background info. I have some personal friends who are addicts. I’ve been with them to AA and NA meetings. I have some friends from childhood who have died because of substance abuse. I have a shitload of respect towards people who realize their relationship with substances is not healthy and work to do something for it. The amount of work and effort it takes for these people to do it is fucking enormous. 
 
Frankly, I don’t really understand where this jerk is coming from. I usually can understand the anti-theists come from but this one is just kind of strange to me. Now, if these people who “got clean” were saying things that belittled those who still partied it would be one thing. That may even be the case with the individual who started this jerk. But once that ball got rolling it turned into a way to just shit on everyone who used to party hard but then stopped. 

But anyway, here are some quotes. 

Ignoring the baby boomer dig, it starts out somewhat reasonable: 

&gt;Standard baby boomer bullshit - fucked around when younger, discovered god after his belly and hairline gave up, and now he insists on controlling the evil materialistic world that every sinner lives in. Fuck these dipshits.

So yeah, if someone gets clean and tries to judge others who keep on using they’re kind of a dick. 

But it quickly spins out of control and expands its scope:

&gt;That still happens. I'm nearing 30, and I notice it happening already to my generation. People who I used to hang out with have already gotten fat and are balding, then suddenly they make a 180 degree turn towards The Light and start facebook preaching against the very things he's guilty of. Just 5 years ago the same person was doing naked kegstands and sliding credit cards down strippers' ass cracks...

&gt;I really honestly think it has to do with the fact that these people no longer belong to cliques like they used to in high school/college, so they join the church but they're not bright enough to realize they care more about the social aspect than actually following ""The Word.""

Yes, they stopped partying because they got fat. It couldn’t be that they felt they had a problem with drugs and alcohol. Lots of people become religious after getting sober. My gut tells me because it gives them an instant support system and social circle, but I’m really just idly speculating here. 
Reddit, never leaving a chance to be misogynistic jumps at the chance to hate women: 

&gt;She lost it. All the positive attention she got from being 'wild' went away with her looks. Somebody may have said something to her that caused a paradigm shift. When the middle aged lady gets hammered and acts retarded everybody looks on with pity and concern. When it is the hot 20-sumthin' everybody acts like she's the life of the party.

I have to go out  for a bit. There are actually quite a few different jerks going on in that submission’s comments but this one that I had not noticed before and wanted to point out. Even though it is admittedly a small one.

The CEO of Verizon says he will happily drop contracts if customers make a demand for it. This is something reddit has clamored for in the past (not gonna dig through /r/technology to find it because fuck you; just go with me) so you figure the top comments will be applause and links directing Verizon customers how to voice their demand? Of course you don't, because you're in /r/circlebroke. You know what the top comments will be.

&gt;Where do I demand it?

&gt;[Why, just place your comments in the bin!](http://restlesspilgrim.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/suggestion-box-shredder.jpg) [+427]

Because the CEO flat-out saying he will do something if you all demand it is just like him putting everything in the shredder.

&gt;Yeah, no...seriously. How do i do this? I'm done with Verizon. Had an unlimited data package; Upgraded my phone and I guess that counts as me ""changing my plan"". How is getting a new phone changing your plan and why am I paying the EXACT SAME as before but now with limited data? Pay more for less! Thats one jiggidy-janked business strategy and I'm the dumbass that got swindled by it. Shifty motherfuckers. [+236]

It wouldn't be a thread in /r/technology without an unrelated rant. Verizon sucks, but do you really need to do this right now? When the CEO himself is saying he will do what you want?

&gt;This is the thing I hate about these corporations we're surrounded by these days: they're completely disingenuous.

&gt;The CEO of Verizon knows full well that there's no direct way for customers to ""demand"" that Verizon drop their contracts -- and any idiot can see that if there were a reasonable way to make any such demands, those demands would have been made years ago.

&gt;The truth is, everyone hates those contracts, and this guy is pissing down our legs and telling us it's rain.

&gt;[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=HNmIQX_ImgM#t=49s) sums up the attitude of companies like Verizon. [+103]

Yeah, dude. The only reason they're not selling you contract-less plans is because they're trying to swindle you. Everyone secretly wants to drop $800 on a new phone all at once, but those mean old multinational *communication* companies don't provide any way to contact them, so they're forced to sign a two-year contract! If only they had a phone number or a physical store or something!

&gt;It feels like Verizon is setting up a trap. They drop cell phone contracts and pin us against the wall by another method.

Whatever you need to rationalize your hypocrisy, boyo.

&gt;that's exactly how a satisfied customer *should* feel, scared and leery.

Replace ""satisfied customer"" with ""armchair mouthbreather on reddit"", and I'll agree with you.

&gt;Everybody Email Verizon Customer service! Demand it! Go to their webpage here http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/contact/index.jsp put in your Zip and DEMAND IT!

Halfway down the page and we finally hit a top-level comment that isn't laziness masquerading as cynicism.

&gt;Sounds like HBO. ""There's no demand for streaming our content guys!""

&gt;Or Time Warner. ""There's no demand for faster internet guys!""

I really trust the *owners and operators of a service* more than a *random commenter on the internet*. Considering 95% of folks never go over 2GB of data on their cell phones, yet the internet is filled with arrogant nerds demanding unlimited data, you'll have to forgive me while I believe Verizon.

I honestly felt like this was a fun gift, and as the dad points out in the thread, the gift is about the journey rather than the actual gift at the end (a shirt). The dad does point out in the thread that he has actually bought his son a Fender and will be giving it to him once he reaches the shirt. 

All this sounds fine and dandy until you begin reading the comments... I can't recall the last time I've seen such an entitled jerk as the one going on in that thread. Besides the top comment, it's just a never-ending jerk about how shitty of a father he is due to having his son go through ""all that work"" just for a crappy t-shirt. Maybe my upbringing is different than most of the redditors in that thread, but I never grew up expecting gifts and when I did receive a gift, whether it was some chocolate, a t-shirt or a new bike, I was always appreciative.

I know CB posts usually contain quotes of the offending comments, but due to them all being the same exact comment, I'll just leave one example:

&gt;To be honest, all that effort your son will take to get that bank vault of a box open only to have him find a T-shirt inside is a major asshole move.
At least get a gift that's a little more worthwhile and not just a T-shirt.

[The highest rated question](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12wyyn/yesterday_i_was_laid_off_because_president_obama/c6ytar1) isn't actually a question, it's a statement phrased as a question. It's not like the guy was going to reply ""no"". But hey, it's informative.

I mean I don't even know where to begin. Yes, a black person is the perpetrator in this video, but I could VERY easily see a white, Mexican or person from any race for that matter doing the same thing. This African American happens to be a thief, doesn't mean all blacks are automatically ni*ger thieves as one would be led to believe after reading this thread.

Why DIDN'T he put it in the designated bike rack 50 feet away? Obviously there's a lower chance to be stolen over there. I mean, of all the things to type ""Un Fucking Believable"" over...this is what got you?

- **2nd comment:** [""You're asking black people to call the police...""](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/x06vr/guy_catches_bike_thief_red_handed/c5i0l8o) let's just ignore the fact that one of the 2 guards was white.  Also, aren't the police dumb corrupt pigs that only want to bust pot smokers and don't give a rat's ass about our safety? Which is it?

- **12th highest comment** (out of 900+): [""Those crazy niggers""](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/x06vr/guy_catches_bike_thief_red_handed/c5i1j9s). Not only is this blatantly racist, but it's not inherently funny, witty, amusing, creative, or helpful in any way.  People get downvoted to oblivion for posting a comment such as ""great point, I totally agree"" which isn't any of those adjectives either.  But this is just sick. SRS got to it thankfully, so it may not have as many upvotes as when I originally submitted this

- **a reply to the above comment:** [This entire comment is sick](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/x06vr/guy_catches_bike_thief_red_handed/c5i273c) the worst part is his account name is: ""MadeThisAccountToSay"".  So he clearly believes what he says but too scared to post it on his real account. Exact quotes but left out some words for the sake of brevity:

&gt; Black people perpetuate negative stereotypes all the time. Listen to how they talk and act. **They (black people in general, not just the ones in the video) are lowlife scum with no respect for law or others.** I felt compelled to condemn there (sp) entire race for their actions. There is something inherently wrong with black people, therefore they may be classified justifiably as niggers.



- Not only that, but does anyone else kinda find themselves agreeing with the security guards? The guy filming the video complains 15 times about how no one called the police for lil ol him, despite the fact that he was the sole witness.  Why don't you take 15 seconds and call them yourself if you want it done so badly?  Do you really think the security guards should drop everything and immediately call 911 because a guy claimed he saw someone cut a lock, despite the bike being fine and the suspect is long gone?  Really? They're most likely making $10 an hour, so sorry if a failed bike theft attempt didn't rustle their jimmies.  They have bigger issues than your plight.  You want to be reimbursed for your $5 Masterlock?  Seriously? Be thankful for your good timing and bike your way to Target to grab an actual bike U lock.

Let me preface this by saying this isn’t the thread you’re expecting it to be. If you came here hoping to find an in-depth discussion on why proposing on the internet (or use of memes in general) is the worst thing since sliced euphoria, you’re going to be wildly disappointed. Maybe I’m playing a bit of a devil’s advocate here, but truthfully, I’m not shaking with anger at [this AdviceAnimals post.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1jqm05/this_is_a_marriage_proposal_she_will_recognize_my/)

Since I know we’re all busy and hate reading, I’ll break down the situation here: The OP of the post proposed to his girlfriend using 12 or 13 memes. Right off the bat, the [OP makes it very clear the internet and memes have played a very big part in their relationship](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1jqm05/this_is_a_marriage_proposal_she_will_recognize_my/cbhb6gx), meaning the proposal is probably very meaningful to his fiancée. Additionally, the meme proposal is accompanied by[ a dozen commissioned deviantart portraits of the couple](http://imgur.com/a/KltfH), several of which are legitimately cute. Finally, it’s important to recognize the meme proposal was more of a cutesy suprise thing and less of an actual proposal, since they had[ already commissioned a ring,](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1jqm05/this_is_a_marriage_proposal_she_will_recognize_my/cbhd6dq) were [living together](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1jqm05/this_is_a_marriage_proposal_she_will_recognize_my/cbhcndy), and were planning to get married. The fiancée loves it, is thrilled by her future spouse’s creativity, and says[ yes on the spot](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1jqm05/this_is_a_marriage_proposal_she_will_recognize_my/cbhcibi). Everyone ends up happy and everything goes as planned.

But Reddit will have none of that. 

The post goes over well for a little while on /r/AdviceAnimals until it is cross-posted to /r/cringepics (and subsequently, /r/all if it wasn’t there already), at which point it suffers a massive wave of downvotes and comments. Let’s look at a few choice examples.

I think there’s got to be a point where we all step back and evaluate how we interact with other humans.

Down near the bottom are the jerky reddit opinions we’re all used to. They must be fat, they must be idiots, etc. Nothing new here.

In conclusion, I know that this internet proposal seems immature and silly, but if it makes the two of them happy, I fail to see why it warrants every single person in the comments thread exploding with hatred. I can’t understand why the entire comments section is predicated off fat jokes and links to /r/cringe when EVERYTHING GOES AS PLANNED. Just because something isn’t meaningful to you doesn’t mean you have to make fun of people it matters to.

I was reading a comment somewhere about reddit and relationship threads, and how the hivemind loves encouraging people to break up. The comment basically boiled down to the claim that it’s easy for reddit to encourage people to end relationships because they aren’t in love with the other person. I think that kind of thing applies here: with 2 exceptions, nobody in the comments thread is a part of the relationship. I trust the two people who are dating to know what the other one wants, and I’ll always accept that point of view over a furious redditor telling them how wrong their decisions are. It took a while, but about halfway down the[ /r/cringepics thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1jqnxy/so_a_guy_is_proposing_to_his_girlfriend_through/), I found one guy who agrees with me.

Not only is the pirate bay a good site to get your movies from, it is **the worlds greatest repository of culture ever assembled**.

Top comment so far is a bunch of people patting each other on the back for supporting piracy and freedom and praising the pirate bay owner for making it. No word of praise for any of the artists who make the movies, songs, and games that people download from it though.


Second top comment is Notch making a joke about losing money from piracy. His second post though, is a lot more reasonable, of course it gets almost no replies compared to his first post.

&gt; For other games, I think piracy can definitely negatively affect the total number of units sold. This is especially true for hollywood style big story heavy big productions that are only expected to sell well and stay in the public conscience for a few months. That still doesn't mean anyone has actually LOST any money, as a bad review also can affect the total number of sales, and hopefully nobody thinks it would be sane to sue magazines for ""loss of profit"" over bad reviews.

Its quite charming actually, he just forced people to disagree with piracy for all or disagree with Notch, I wonder what reddit will choose?

Considering how many times ""notch says pirate his game!"" is used as a justification to pirate EVERYTHING, without people stopping to think that maybe he's only saying that because he actually wouldn't be hurt even if minecraft never sold a single copy ever again.

Further down we have peter sundre's justification for it

&gt; 99.9% make their living on working in grocery stores, gas stations, office work or whatever. Rather put a system in place where culture is supported by the government, which it is partially today.

**Point of the day: Reddit constantly screams and cries at any hint of active moderation. This jerk is probably one of the most self-destructive ones I've seen on this website, and here's why:** 

Reddit has gotten really, really shitty in terms of quality-- no surprise there. Is there a particular reason as to why this is?  
  
Eh, no. However it's widely speculated that it's because of the increase of users/more young people/etc. I don't think that's the biggest factor.  
  
It's the lack of moderation. Quick (semi-hyperbolic) comparison here:  
  
/r/askscience, large user-base, constantly praised for the strict moderation with no backlash from the users. [Even was nominated, and won, for the best moderation team of 2011](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bestof2011/comments/pr4yd/congratulations_to_the_askscience_mod_team/). Could the quality of the subreddit be due to the moderators removing it from the default list? Maybe. But the quality has no doubt been maintained since I've been here (inb4 'only 7 months hurrrrrr'. I have like 7 accounts).  
  
Then we have our most loved subreddit, the tolerant and loving /r/atheism!  
  
To be fair, moderation has *slightly* tried to take a turn for the better,  with the addition of /u/jij and the removal of /u/juliebeen. However, the top moderator has [always](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9em07/a_note_from_the_creator_of_the_atheism_subreddit/) taken a laissez faire approach, and says that [it won't be changing any time soon](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/rg164/moderator_message_updated_community_policy_for/).  
  
Anyway, that was just a quick comparison to wet your whistle for a second.  
  
Redditors have always encouraged behind-the-scenes leadership. In fact, it wasn't even a year ago that the /r/jailbait debacle took place, with people discouraging action from administration due to 'free speech.' Don't know what I mean? [Yeah](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkslu/why_do_the_reddit_admins_allow_child_exploitation/). People defending those subreddits because of free speech. Riiiiiiiiight.  
  
Then you have the 'democracy' thing. There's some kind of widespread opinion that [reddit is a democracy](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/s4sgd/have_the_official_owners_of_reddit_told/). Old thread, but it pretty much encompasses  the basic idea a lot of people around here have.  
  
&gt;But that's why we have upvotes and downvotes! The community can moderate itself! We don't need censorship!  
  
Yeah, okay. I wonder if anyone has evidence of this actually working.  
  
Wait a second, /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu did an experiment with this, didn't it?  
  
[Yeah, yeah that's right! They had a no-mod month!](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/rolbw/after_careful_consideration_we_the_mods_have/)  
  
Oh... wait....  
  
[I forgot that they shortened it to no-mod week, after the community of one of the worst quality subreddits made a fuss about the lack of moderation and the immediate decline in quality.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/rzhmo/since_you_guys_are_pretty_adamant_about_it_were/)  
  
Yeah, that democracy you guys want? Doesn't fucking work.  
  
&gt;Lol, but that's /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu. They have terrible quality anyway!  
  
Uh-huh. So let's check out these other laissez faire subreddits.

/r/politics: Shit  
  
/r/videos: Racist shit. [Constant](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/search?q=videos+racism&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on) racist drama, with heavily upvoted, blatant racism and racial slurs being used. [Also shameless link to my own comment with context concerning this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/x0ixs/holy_racism_batman/c5ibaag?context=5)  
  

/r/gaming: Shit. However it is a very [self-aware piece](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/zguzc/hear_me_out_before_raising_your_pitchforks_what/) of shit. But what do you think will come from that thread of anti-jerking? Oh yeah. Nothing. That was less than ten days ago and the front page of /r/gaming is currently macros, cosplaying, Black Mesa Black Mesa Black Mesa, and 'DAE PLAY THIS?!'  
  
The userbase of the default subreddits is *too content* with their shit quality. They won't change unless they're made to by moderators-- and ooh boy! What happens when moderators moderate subjectively?  
  
Well, they don't. [They're afraid.](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/r5ew8/a_plea_to_you_rscience/c431evo)  
  
Reddit has a tendency to give ridiculous backlash when moderators make decisions they don't agree with. Most recent example is Overly-Attached-Girlfriend's AMA removal by /u/SupermanV2.  
  
[In case you missed it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ztvyi/i_am_laina_aka_the_overly_attached_girlfriend_ama/c67o6f2)  
  
[Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ztyb5/internet_meme_drama_part_deux_over_in_riama_as/) the /r/SubredditDrama thread about it. [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/zw3re/overly_attached_lynchmob/) the /r/circlebroke thread about it. [*Here's*](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/zw1k7/what_i_imagine_supermanv2_looks_like_the_iama/) the mighty backlash by /r/AdviceAnimals.  
  
Has this been the first time?  
  
[Hah, no. Karmanaut.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uifof/recap_karmanaut_and_riama/) Also, [here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ugzsl/is_there_anything_an_ordinary_reddit_user_can_do/) the /r/AskReddit revolt against the facist moderator censorship. And [here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/tej5o/to_karmanaut_the_riama_moderator_who_deleted_bad/) the obligatory /r/AdviceAnimals meme about it. Because they really fucking love their self-made internet memes.
  
[And this is quite older in comparison, but Saydrah.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/b7tew/fine_here_saydrah_ama_it_couldnt_get_much_worse/)  
  
[And just think of the shitstorm this little comment cause, courtesy of power-user,](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sas91/moderator_deleted_without_explanation_or_prior/c4coh9w?context=3) /u/andrewsmith1986. 
  
Also, here's a /r/TheoryOfReddit post about moderator witch-hunts. [Goes into a little more detail than I.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/t2w14/unintended_consequences_of_moderator_witchhunts/) 
  
So not only is reddit aware that there's shit quality around here, they oppose the moderation that obviously keeps several subreddits together.  
  
Possibly my biggest issue with this is that moderators choose this, which is fine, in their respective subreddits. However, this ""you can't tell me what to do"" attitude spreads and infects. It becomes the 'norm' to not moderate based on quality, and subreddits that *do* get [chastized](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/dmpzr/the_moderators_of_rchristianity_actively_censor/) in the process with cries of 'le censorship!'  
  
Also, in order to not come across as if I think all moderators are amazing and should never be questioned, there [are](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/rxjx4/ebay_employees_should_not_be_moderators_of_this/) cases of shitty moderation or... [well, whatever happened here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDramaDrama/comments/zafff/recap_the_great_subredditdrama_banfest_and/)  
  

I guess I'm going to wrap this up now because I now realize that I've watched five episodes of DBZ in the process of writing this and I have no life.  
  
Healthy moderation is required for quality communities, as legal authority is required for those in real life as well. Unfortunately any attempt at enforcing subjectively made rules this late in the development of default subreddits (as well as smaller ones) is too little too late due to the remarkable anti-authority jerk around here. I honestly don't think this is fixable anymore, unfortunately. I guess this jerk has really destroyed this place from the inside out.

Things like this are hard to come by, but when it shows itself in the form of ""please don't upvote"", reddit blows its collective load and jerks so furiously that not even the strength of The Hulk and speed of The Flash could keep up. 

These posts can be found high and low on reddit, the most recent offender being [this /r/askreddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wxfat/dont_up_vote_i_dont_know_what_subreddit_to_ask/), complete with such hit comments as [*""SHUT UP AND TAKE MY UPVOTES UHHUEHUE""*](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wxfat/dont_up_vote_i_dont_know_what_subreddit_to_ask/c5haifh). Is it getting brave in here?

And of course, what more would we expect from /r/gaming than to [do the same](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/wuv5r/really_stupid_question_dont_upvote/). If you were expecting comments better than [*""lol i sure showed you OP!""*](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/wuv5r/really_stupid_question_dont_upvote/c5gmz5r), you were sadly mistaken. Bravery of this magnitude knows no bounds.

But if you even look to the more specific subreddits like /r/pokemon, you will find it [no different from the rest](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/v1gd9/4th_gen_pokedex_question_dont_upvote/). Even here will you find classic hits such as [*""NO OP I UPVOTES U ANYWAYS""*](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/v1gd9/4th_gen_pokedex_question_dont_upvote/c50h5gn), [*""it's a trap! like that one joke from 2006 lol!""*](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/v1gd9/4th_gen_pokedex_question_dont_upvote/c50j7od), and [*""guys seriously I'm so edgy do i get upvotes too?""*](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/v1gd9/4th_gen_pokedex_question_dont_upvote/c50ittx) I'm squirting bravery juice all over this motherfucker.

It is the jerk that can't be stopped, the paramount of self-gratuitous wit and charm, the only way most of them will ever *""stick it to the man""*. Sometimes I believe honest discussion can be easily found on the frontpage, sometimes I forget that deep down they can't deny themselves a good ol' jerk, and that's when I realize the error of my ways and remember [reddit's top-rated post of all time](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/92dd8/test_post_please_ignore/).",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_wxmc1,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/wxmc1/op_asked_us_not_to_upvote_his_mundane_question/,

So [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1glqon/redditors_who_are_against_smoking_the/) we have the typical ""People who hold [Insert Unpopular-on-Reddit-Opinion Here], why?"" thread in AskReddit, with a well-intentioned but ultimately failed question about people who are against pot smoking and legalization. 

Sorting by Top comments, there's literally [only](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1glqon/redditors_who_are_against_smoking_the/calgljk) [a](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1glqon/redditors_who_are_against_smoking_the/caljmxg) [handful](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1glqon/redditors_who_are_against_smoking_the/calkahj) [of](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1glqon/redditors_who_are_against_smoking_the/caliryf) [answers](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1glqon/redditors_who_are_against_smoking_the/calknlz) from people who actually *are* against pot that have kept positive karma.

So the jerk here is very, very strong. What we have is a thread full of pro-marijuana Redditors voicing their devil's advocate comments in an effort to get the best of both karma worlds. They pander to the marijuana crowd by mentioning little things that they all hate about weed culture, but always remember to add some version of ""I'm still pro-legalization though"". It's the ultimate karma grab.

We've seen similar jerks in threads like [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10g8vd/i_have_to_write_a_paper_about_and_argue_against/) about gay marriage, or in the subreddit /r/changemyview (although in that subreddit, there's actually mostly non-pandering).

Now, to get to the comments....

You get the picture.

One of the more unpleasant bits of this thread are some of the response to [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1glqon/redditors_who_are_against_smoking_the/calgljk) comment. It's a Redditor telling his story about how a friend was hit by a person driving under the influence of marijuana, and how his friend is now paralyzed and in depression. Here are some responses:

&gt; [I am very sorry for your friend...but often times they will test the blood of the person, and marijuana will show up, therefore they are said to be on it. For a daily smoker, it may stay in the system for 1 month or longer.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1glqon/redditors_who_are_against_smoking_the/cali215) +202
&gt;&gt;[Also the substance they test for is not the substance you get high from. It is a byproduct created when THC is broken down. The substance that causes you to fail a piss test does not get you high.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1glqon/redditors_who_are_against_smoking_the/calkes5) +65

I am at a complete loss for words here. These guys are jerking so hard in defense of weed that they just go ahead an assume a hell of a lot from the commenter's story. They assume that:

* the driver was not obviously high
* the police did not do any number of the tests that don't require a urine sample (crossed eyes, balancing, counting speed, and there's actually a [saliva test](http://norml.org/legal/drug-testing/item/the-abcs-of-marijuana-and-drug-testing) that determines weed use in the past few hours).
* the driver didn't just flat out admit it
* the driver did not have any weed on his person

...and more.

Further jerky responses come in, with one Redditor saying [""not here to argue, but what is your stance on alcohol?""](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1glqon/redditors_who_are_against_smoking_the/calkbja). We all know the real reason he asked that question.

Continuing:

* **Orwellian:** when you have to go to the store to buy a gun for under a thousand dollars instead of using a device which costs thousands of dollars to print a low quality gun.

Also in the dictionary: 

* **Censorship:** When someone else has a website, and that person decides what you can and can't post on their website.
* **Freedom of speech:** When you should be able to download the latest movies for free, but instead have to pay up to 25$ to see said movie.

**Feminist**: Female supremacist, someone who wants to take away **Video-Games** and **Freedom of Speech**, they will often attempt to achieve this through **Censorship**

**Egalitarian**: The only fair way to approach equality - someone who is focused on making sure that the oppressed middle class white men in society get given the same boosts as minority women in poverty. The opposite of **Feminism**.

**Ephebophile**: Poor misunderstood men that are burdened with their attraction to young teenage girls and pornography involving them who need to be protected and given support, much like **Paedophiles**, although the distinction is necessary so no-one is confused. Often oppressed by **feminists**.

EDIT: **Pirate**: Freedom fighter; someone who makes a stand against **Big Media** and other large **Corporations** such as **EA** while single-handedly assisting underpaid indie groups and other small-time artists in the media industry by **Torrenting** and downloading TV shows, music and games they like without paying for them.

**Hitler**: Leader of Germany 1933-1945. Fixed their economy, good public speaker. Best known for incorrectly using eugenics.

**Jews**: Members of the most laid back religion, with the exception of those who live in Israel, those who support Israel's right to exist, those who believe in the covenant of the bris, those who complain about anti-semitic jokes, and those who are members of the global cabal that controls every bank and the media.

Let us applaud these wonderful people and let's contribute some more. I'm sure you know what needs to be done.

 There are a lot more words that need to be redefined and properly defined by the way redditors use them frequently. Such as: Politically correct, friendzoning, attention whores, SRS, women, Sweden, USA, rape, redditor ...

 The name of the dictionary must be decided. Is it going to be Smugapedia, superiorictionary, bravictionary or something else. 

Let's convert reddit-speak to English, comrades!

As is stated on the sidebar:

&gt;/r/worldnews is for major news from around the world except US-internal news / US politics.

Now, to me this rule seems pretty clear. If it happened in the US, it doesn't belong here. This isn't some new-fangled Reddit idiosyncrasy, every newspaper in the world uses the term ""World News"" to refer to news from outside the medium's country. Since Reddit is for all intents and purposes an American site, /r/worldnews was supposed to be US-news free.

But most Reddit comments said things like:

&gt;[Boston Marathon is a WORLD EVENT, mods.](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1cerrp/boston_marathon_explosions_dozens_wounded_as_two/c9fsqva)

 -

&gt;[The BBC just said ""THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL EVENT""](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1cerrp/boston_marathon_explosions_dozens_wounded_as_two/c9ft0id)

Claiming that this event had a global impact, it therefore deserved to be on r/worldnews. Despite the fact that the label ""World News"" isn't a judgement of importance, but a geographic classification.

/r/worldnews was already quite Ameri-centric, with news directly affecting the US being more upvoted than more important events that had little effect on Americans. But this wasn't too bad and r/worldnews was a bearable source of international news, although with some horrendous comment threads. Knowing this, yesterday I made the following prediction:

&gt;[I really hope the mods stick to their guns and because of this /r/news grows and becomes the default US news subreddit. Otherwise, we risk the slippery slope that "" any big US news are international news"" and /r/worldnews essentially becomes r/AmericanNews, leaving actual international news buried.](http://np.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1cf5tb/id_like_to_take_a_moment_to_talk_about_the_reddit/c9fzmpd)

Presumably because of yesterday's backlash, /r/worldnews mods have loosened the first rule in their sidebar. [This is what /r/worldnews looks like now](http://i.imgur.com/pWtGGwQ.png). Five of the top ten news stories are from the US. Meanwhile, [news that 7 people died in protests due the Venezuelan elections](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1ch0b1/7_dead_61_injured_following_protest_after/) is sitting at a measly 324 upvotes. 24 hours it has taken Reddit to completely destroy the original spirit of the subreddit.

It just goes to show what seems obvious by now: without moderation any decent sized subreddit will be wrecked by Redditors.

TL;DR of the video: German tourists in the US were going 98 in a 70 and got pulled over. The cop was a little verbally aggressive but let them off with a warning even though he could've arrested them and detained them as foreigners in an American prison.

I don't even understand the anti-cop mentality.

He seriously could've fucked them over hard if he wanted to, but instead let them go on about their day with a warning, yet reddit automatically labels the cop as a raging asshole because he's confrontational.

My favorite one out of all of them was the one about Staples.

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10rdtd/what_is_something_your_current_or_past_employer/c6g37nf

Apparently, this brave IT worker used to be a tech there, and insists that all the store's services amount to ""just a norton scan"" and a quick run of ""malwarebytes freeware"".

Sounds awesome right? What a story!! There's just one problem with it; I used to work there too, and it's complete bullshit. The ""tuneup"" he's referring to is an entire suite of programs run consecutively, including registry cleaners, a defrag program, an automated version of disk clean up, and a lot of msconfig tweaking.

Perhaps he wasn't motivated enough to actually give a shit about what he was doing (too busy aspiring to be an IT worker), but that was the minor part of his thread though. The best part was when he bravely claimed that Staples was illegally using freeware to perform one of their most expensive services.

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10rdtd/what_is_something_your_current_or_past_employer/c6g37nf?context=4

As you can see, someone immediately insists that the OP report them for their dastardly deeds. The OP actaully responds with:

&gt;I did try at one point, I left a message ""What if I told you a MAJOR retail chain is using your product to generate profit"" no reply

No reply? I'm just SHOCKED! Why would they ignore such a vague sketchy phone call? One of his responders insists that he should:

&gt;Be willing to testify!

Yes! Call them back and insist that you'll go to court! Stop the evil corporation from tricking people into paying for illegally used freeware. Why oh why won't MB respond?

Because, if this halfwit neckbeard had been awake for more than a few moments at work, he'd have noticed that not only is staples using MB with their permission; they're using a customized version specifically **made for Staples**!

A current employee actually attempts to break the jerk, posting this:

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10rdtd/what_is_something_your_current_or_past_employer/c6gdx3t

In it is actual [visual proof](http://imgur.com/a/c6KA9#1) that Staples indeed is running a custom corporate version of the program.

Reddit's response?

&gt;[I don't see how this is any proof of it being licensed](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10rdtd/what_is_something_your_current_or_past_employer/c6ge3ge).

Are you fucking kidding me?! He posted a motherfucking screenshot from his damn job, and you still don't believe him?!

Overall though, my favorite quote (and a perfect summary of reddits attitude towards society and all things non-STEM) from the OP is:

&gt;these ""EasyTech EXPERTS"" are actually just retail employees.

Anyway, let's move forward with some of the insight this thread gave us into the operation of our prison system. I can't say which one, as the OP did not specify whether we were talking about a state, county, or federal prison, but that's irrelevant since no one is actually interested in answering the question anyway.

Annnnd, we're off!. Our top comment, ladies and gentlemen, is naturally going to be about prison rape. At +1517, Redditors agree that this is, without a doubt, the best answer to OP's question.  
  
The [next highest comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10lrjq/say_im_sentenced_to_10_years_of_prison_for/c6ekaam), currently sitting at +968 was the result of a half-assed Google search and relates to Medical Parole in Maryland. Close, but no cigar. This law applies to terminal illnesses or an *irreversible coma*. Neither of those were included in OP's question. I know it sucks neckbeards, but Google can only get you so far.

&gt;I would like to point out the issue of having found out for sure they're watching everything we do, and then wanting to buy things from here. (I'm going to go get a visa gift card and do it. That's probably a good way around my fears.)

These are just the ones that pop up with my filters, I can't imagine how much actual crap is out there.  I'm not saying Snowden is necessarily lying, or that he shouldn't be taken seriously.  I just find it ridiculous that if a low level civilian contractor makes claims against the government reddit is so excited they'll eat it up without anyone questioning his credibility.  I've been noticing this trend a lot on here lately where credibility just doesn't matter as long as you're saying what redditors want to hear.

At this point I think the only subreddits I subscribe to that haven't been affected by this are the ones that revolve around sex, alcohol, and money.  Pretty sad that these are the subreddits least overrun by filth.

Clearly this is an important topic and one that I've spent plenty of time looking into, but I think we can agree that reddit is the single worst way to get unbiased news, especially anything relating to politics.

The image, if you have slow internet or are feeling particularly lazy today, is a facebook screenshot of a couple asking for friends to come help them move. The replies to the couple are Christians saying that they are praying for it to go well.

Obviously, the sane thing to conclude is that the theists are evil, lazy morons who don't have anything better to do than lay in bed all day. If you thought that the Christians had prior engagements, like work for example, you're an idiot. 

Let's ignore the sarcastic comments about /r/atheism subscribers sending prayers for the move to go well and get down to the nitty gritty. It starts with a person pointing out that maybe the Christians aren't being purposefully lazy and that they want their friends' move to go safely:

&gt; To play Devil's Advocate for a moment - pretend this was an Atheist couple posting a similar request, and a bunch of their Atheist friends posted notes like ""I wish I could! Good luck! Hope it goes well!"" etc. Would you consider anything about that annoying/infuriating/outrageous enough to be worthy of complaining about on Reddit?
Granted, there are many times that many Christians play the ""prayer"" card to justify all sorts of bad behavior, ranging from general passive-aggressive douchebaggery (""we'll pray that you learn to be a better person"") to dangerous insanity (""Timmy doesn't need any antibiotics, we're praying the meningitis away""). But there are also many times when it's simply a gesture of emotional support for others.
Now, I don't know, based on the information given, whether these particular folks are being assholes or not in this case (any more than I would know in the Atheist version I gave). Are they actually unable to help, and expressing support anyways? Are they just not wanting to help out, and pretending to care to save face? Who knows. Either way, this really isn't a great example of how/why religion can be harmful (which, I assume, is the reason so many posts like this show up here), so it just comes across as petty and bitter. It's posts like these that give this subreddit a bad reputation, and if we really want to demonstrate to the world that ours is a better viewpoint to operate from, we need to start examining behavior like this and making adjustments. +106 karma

This man, of course, is wrong. As our heroic commenter who replies to this absurd statement is quick to point out that the theists actually think they are helping with the prayer while atheists are much more humble with a simple 'good luck' wished upon their friends. 

&gt; The key difference is that praying Christians actually believe they are doing something, while the Atheists in your scenario are just politely opting out and realize they aren't. Of course neither group are actually helping, but the annoying/infuriating/outrageous part (at least for me) only comes from the Christians believing they are helping, not from the lack of help itself. +110

Christians aren't humble, now let me tell you just how humble I, as an atheist, am. I am smarter than theists, I have more critical thinking skills than theists, and I am far more humble than theists. In reply:

&gt; Thanks for this. This is exactly what I was going to say. The hypothetical atheists are sending their regrets; the Christians here are patting themselves on the back while doing absolutely nothing. +32

They said they were going to pray for their friends, so clearly these idiot Christians think that they are actually helping them move boxes from the house to the truck. 

&gt; You see, now you assume that those people will actually take the time to go pray specifically for the moving couple. Most of them wont, maybe a quick mention during mandatory grace, but that's it. +7

They are too lazy to even pray properly. Thank goodness we have a /r/atheism subscriber telling us this, since atheists are such reputable sources on Christian prayer ethics.

&gt; Nah, a lot of them really will, and really will feel like they're ""helping."" They'll even mentally give themselves credit when other people step up to actually help, since it's ""because I prayed!"" (so much for free will, eh? :p) +4

The Christians said they were going to pray for their friends, so we should immediately assume that they think that they are actually helping them move. 

&gt; Ahhh, prayer. Helping folks remove personal guilt and responsibility for thousands of years. +64

This is assuming that the Christians are being lazy and that they are entitled to help every single person who ever asks them for anything.

&gt; Praying: So much easier than doing. +28

Once again, the Christians are not helping their friends because they are lazy, not because they have jobs or other things they have already agreed to do.

Let's finish looking at the comments with one of the most original and clever comments that you will ever see:

&gt; Jesus will help you load that truck. You should also hire Jose and Paco, too. +27

I wonder when /r/atheism will get tired of that joke?

I'm mainly just talking about this particular comment thread. The AskReddit topic was ""What's the worst thing you've witnessed someone do, and never told anyone about it?""

This commenter tells a story about how he witnessed a freshman in his high school gym class get ganged up on by the popular athlete archetype kids. He found out later that the kid was beat up and sodomized with a ruler. Pretty dark stuff.

One commenter wonders how kids can think this is okay, to which another replies with:
&gt;Really immature + low IQ + thinking they're really mature = 90% of highschool.

Pretty broad generalization there, but pretty par for the course with reddit.
&gt;Then the victims one day bring a gun to school and kill a few douche bags and then they're the bad guys.

... WHAT?! How is that an okay thing to say? 382 points at the time of this writing.

Luckily a lot of replies disagree with him.
&gt;People who shoot up schools are bad guys, even if they are bully victims, even if they felt justified in their revenge.

To the tune of 823 upvotes.

This next comment tells a story about his experience with bullying.
&gt;But what if there really is no other way out?
I got beaten up daily after school for several years. I tried everything. I told everyone about it, I showed the teachers my wounds, etc.
But all they did was saying that it must have been my fault because I was cheeky, **always countered their verbal attacks**, never subordinated myself and never even fought back. I grew up with abusive parents so I never even cried when I got hit and always tried to remain calm.

Sounds like this guy *might* have been using some fighting words.

&gt;I really haven't seen a way out of this and one day took a rusty metal rod that ways laying around and chased them away from me.
This was also the first time that the school intervened. By giving me detention.

Stupid fundie school system...

&gt;All the years of constant bullying, unjustice by everyone and total ignorance from the teachers made me hate everyone. If I hadn't had good friends as neighbours at that time and if I had access to weapons I would have killed them all without thinking twice about it.
They weren't humans too me. They were like animals. Animals that don't deserve to live.

I'm sorry, can you run that by me again?

&gt;They weren't humans too me. They were like animals. Animals that don't deserve to live.

Even though this has only 32 points that's still 32 goddamn people that read this and agreed with him.

What they don't realize is that they themselves will become those shitty old people who bitch about the good ole days and the next generation are waiting for them to die if only so they can't listen to their bitching.

My generation, the 90's kids, has a lot of those kind of people when it comes to video games. Video games weren't as accepted in mainstream culture when I was younger. Now that playing video games is more accepted, the market for video games is much more vast. From your nerdiest neckbeard to your casual grandma, companies want to tap into that market which means they need to change. Which is something some gamers fail to grasp.

One of the biggest thing is DLC.There have been really good DLC (akin to expansion packs) and really bad DLC (horse armor). DLC stands for downloadable content so it's a broad concept. Well, some gamers in /r/games can't seem to get the concept of DLC.

[Could we start using the term 'Expansion Pack' again?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/11gtdd/could_we_start_using_the_term_expansion_pack_again/)

In their second paragraph, OP states how he knows how things have changed.
&gt;Nowadays, though, things are different. Nowadays, the gaming landscape has changed, and, as the demographic of gamers has grown

Okay, so OP is pretty self aware

&gt;Those were the glory days, of course, when FPS protagonists weren't strapped to corridor-bound snails, before EVE Online and WoW had driven every other MMO to extinction


The glory days? ULTIMA ONLINE ANYONE?!?!? OP has nostalgia glasses on so hardcore that he's become stupid. First off, there are more MMO's besides EVE and WoW. Rift, LOTRO, etc... I'm not even gonna go into the FPS bit because I'd get an aneurysm.

&gt; For, as every hardcore gamer knows, deep in their heart, every bit of DLC is really just a fragment of content, that was rightfully ours anyway when we bought the game, taken away by the evil publishers so they can charge us extra, for far more than it's worth.

Actually, I think I'm probably going to get an aneurysm anyways. I play video games, it's a major hobby of mine. I've been going to PAX (video game convention) for six years in a row. I don't call myself a gamer, much less a hardcore gamer exactly because of people like OP. Triple A titles cost a lot of money to produce and the developer doesn't owe you shit. They didn't take anything away from you. To call publishers evil and demand content reeks of bullshit entitlement. My opinion as an barely informed consumer is that if DLC's werent an option. They wouldn't have been fucking made for you to buy because life lesson #1 no one is going to give you shit for free. If they do it's shitty no good.

&gt;And so I'd like to ask a question of you, r/Games; Could we start using the term 'expansion pack' again?

Let's start calling black people niggers again because OP is too stupid to read a fucking description.

&gt;And, frankly, I'd like to be able to tell which it is when someone mentions it, and whether I should be OK with spending $5, $10 or $20 on it.

There are reviews and stuff you can read. Stop being a lazy fuck and inform yourself.

Top comment has this line

&gt;DLC:Short,Costs around $10,You wont get the full experience without it.

Refuses to acknowledge that DLC is a encompassing term and sees DLC as some boogey man term. Goes into the whole DLC BAD, Publishers = EVIL jerk. There are plenty of DLCs that give you a new experience

Luckily someone mentions this

&gt;What is this? You won't get the full experience without it? Borderlands DLCs were $10 - you didn't need them to have the full experience with Borderlands.
Saints Row 3 DLCs were absolutely not necessary to have the full experience.
DX:HR - full game without any DLC
Skyrim's Hearthfire - DLC, not needed for full experience
Skyrim's Dawngaurd - DLC, not needed for full experience
Assuming that all DLC is ripped from the full game is foolish.

Much like how old people want to legislate to benefit them or fuck the young people in the ass. Let's make publishers follow a rule of what is an expansion pack.

&gt;The problem is that publishers might actually start using it, but without a set of rules for its usage, they'll start branding small DLCs as ""Expansion Packs"" even if they aren't on that level.

Big companies don't give a fuck. We're moving towards a world of megacorps and a dystopian world. Enough people don't give a shit that it's gonna happen.

The comment that set off this rant was in a completely different post about SimCity. Take from it what you will

&gt;No word on whether you could just randomly unleash disasters for fun and reload an old save game (80% of what we did back in the days). Also clearly marketed towards ""social""/Facebook shit (""Tim Timmerson of Timtown, Missouri will now have a random stat of his city rated in school grades""). I doubt we'll have any control over this whatsoever. Actually, I always just switched off disasters when I wanted to build really nice, big cities instead of just fooling around. I bet you can't do that, either, because it would be unfair to your global Twitter highscore list or whatever.

I'm not bitter about this because like whatever.

I don't understand how Reddit has a wankaround over how brilliant Gandhi was but ignore the whole 'eye for an eye makes the whole worl blind thing'. Also in this one, there's a brilliant ignorance over saying this type of justice is wrong, yet going ahead to justify it. Wut?

I'll admit, most of these are heavily downvoted, but I really was shocked about how easily these people condemn people to being burnt on the spot, despite the fact that they went apeshit over Kim Dotcom being inspected by the police despite pretty clearly being guilty of fraud! It's ridiculous! 

Also, reddit fights so much for 'freedom' of different forms (internet, speech etc...) but they neglect that perhaps we have a fundamental freedom to life, and not be executed by an angry mob! It's fucking ridiculous.

Today, in /r/askhistorians - which is usually but not always refreshingly free from the sort of shit that gets scrutinized here - a user's question about [how to deal with the claims of Holocaust deniers](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z9ywa/how_to_deal_with_holocaust_denial/) was met by an invasion of actual Holocaust deniers eager to spread their glorious truth to anyone who would hear it.

Predictably, the mods conducted a sort of low-impact holocaust of their own, deleting dozens of comments, banning dozens of users (a lot of whom had apparently just created their accounts within minutes of posting), and generally not putting up with that shit.  Makes for a nice change from /r/politics, /r/worldnews and /r/worldpolitics - to say nothing of /r/conspiracy, where there's nothing so perfidious that The Jew has not allegedly attempted it.

Two /r/subredditdrama threads and counting - [one](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/zb94k/a_question_about_holocaust_denial_in/) and [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/zbqc6/raskhistorians_zionist_moderators_go_on_ban/).  The second one appears to have been posted by a denier, accuses 'em all of being Zionist shills, and so on.

So far, so fucking stupid, but at least the mods are doing their job.  What about the rest?

/r/askhistorians gives flair to users who have demonstrated their credentials in commenting on historical matters.  The flaired users are being pretty reasonable about it, urging caution, exercising charity, trying to tease out nuance - but also being firm in condemning bullshit when they see it:

---

[There are actually two types of Holocaust denial that have been identified. One type is the outright denial that the Holocaust ever happened. The second type is the minimization of the Holocaust. That is, that the extermination of the Jews was not a unique event. Rather, that it was one genocide amongst others.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z9ywa/how_to_deal_with_holocaust_denial/c62vb59)

[Holocaust Denial on Trial is a superb website maintained by Emory University that details David Irving's suit against Deborah Lipstadt for libel. You can read the full-text decision of the suit, as well.  The website gives a history of Holocaust denial and goes through common arguments and statements of prominent Holocaust deniers - sometimes line by line - and demonstrate why these arguments don't follow the historical method.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z9ywa/how_to_deal_with_holocaust_denial/c62ypl1)

---

[One of the issues in dealing with Holocaust deniers is the same as dealing with Confederate sympathizers and other fringe groups. Those that honestly believe this alternative narrative have made it part of their character, or their family's heritage. As such, you begin to argue belief rather than fact. They typically will see an attempt to correct them as an attack on their values, character or morals. Once you have reached that point, there is no way to actually persuade someone they are wrong. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z9ywa/how_to_deal_with_holocaust_denial/c62sajt)

---

[In some ways, therefore, and forgive me, Holocaust deniers aren't attacking the historical truth of the holocaust - that would be an absurd thing to do. If it was just the historical truth of the Holocaust free from this meaning, then they wouldn't give two figs. They are seeking to reject parts of that richness of understanding built up around it that they find themselves objecting to - and they chose this ridiculous, offensive method to do it. As an historian and a human being, I cannot have more contempt for them. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z9ywa/how_to_deal_with_holocaust_denial/c63161o)

[A good historian tries to ascertain accuracy and falsehood by means of evidence and reason, not by means of personal views. ""Having a different view"" has no value unless both evidence and reason break down (and not much even then).  Anyway, that's not the case with the Holocaust, so ""having a different view"" is exactly equivalent to a deliberate attempt to spread misinformation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z9ywa/how_to_deal_with_holocaust_denial/c6348c9)

[I think it's clear that people who argue based on some moralistic bent when it comes to the Holocaust as being ""unique"" compared to all the other genocides of history have an axe to grind and interests to promote, and have left the realm of history for ""Holocaust studies"", an area much more based on literary criticism than history.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z9ywa/how_to_deal_with_holocaust_denial/c633agf)

I wonder what that ""axe to grind"" and those ""interests to promote"" might be?  Might they rhyme with *rionism* or *rorldwide rewish ronspiracy*?

---

[Well, define denial, because most informed people that actually talk about this are not focused on denying that anything happened so much as putting it in context with other world events and questioning the kid gloves we handle the Holocaust with compared to other world events.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z9ywa/how_to_deal_with_holocaust_denial/c62syzk)

""This subreddit"" is comprised of just under 40,000 subscribers, most of whom are there because they do not know a lot about history and want to learn.  Maybe 1% of those subscribed to /r/askhistorians have flair, and not even all of them are qualified to discuss this matter without being misled by propagandizing revisionists.

[And as another commenter said, where does it end? What other questions or statements will be banned?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z9ywa/how_to_deal_with_holocaust_denial/c633uyy)

It ends when racist liars realize they are not welcome.

If there's anything more circle-jerky than that spurious Voltaire quote as deployed in defense of *absolute bullshit*, I've not yet encountered it.

[Moreover, simply banning opinions on historical events is censorship and anti-intellectual. If you're going to ban holocaust denial, why not ban young earth creationism or AIDS denialism? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/z9ywa/how_to_deal_with_holocaust_denial/c631ca3)

It's the slipperiest slope since Grease Mountain, boys!  Obviously there are dozens - hundreds! - of other perfectly reasonable positions that look so much like ***Holocaust Denial*** that they might suffer under the same strictures here set forth.

Also, about a million posts about how making unauthorized copies of content is fine for personal use, but it's totally different because this guy is posting it on a blog with adsense.

""I wouldn't have bought it anyway if I didn't download it, so it's victimless.""

""It's free publicity."" 
""Putting the article on his site doesn't take it off of yours, so it's not theft."" 
""People who went to his site weren't going to go to yours anyway so it's victimless.""

It was exactly how I imagined.

Cannabis is literally a wonder drug and everybody wants to smoke it. 

&gt;How is the job market in Uruguay for programmers? I would consider relocation.

I am willing to uproot from my home in the United States, one of the most developed countries in the world, and move to South America, I do not speak their language, know their customs but they have cheap weed. 

.
&gt;As an American I am really aggravated about this because now I have to look at a map to learn where Uruguay is. 

Gotta throw in a ""American's are all dumb as shit"" jerk in there.

&gt;I think I want to move to Uruguay.

.
&gt;So when will the US invade on some pretext, or will there be ""sanctions?""

Another Merickkka jerk, the US has done some shit to South America but thinking that the US would invade a country because they have legalised a drug is amusing to say the least. 
.
&gt;This is the wrong way to do it. Like everything else, there should be an open market where buyers and sellers agree on a price. What will happen is sellers will flock to the cheapest production costs/highest margins. If you can only sell for $2.5/g, why spend $1.80/g growing it inside if you can grow it in a ditch for $.10/g?

I know linking to users names is frowned upon but this guy is called [REDACTED] and is obviously a free market fanatic, because the free market fixes everything. There is a decent comment below saying why it's being priced so cheaply though.

&gt;Weed that costs $2.5 a gram should be a human right.

I can't tell whether this person is serious or joking, the child comment below is as amusing. 

&gt;Free markets should be a human right, then the prices of all drugs would drop by a few orders of magnitude. 

Yeh...

&gt;BRB. Moving to Uruguay.
.
&gt;TIL: Uruguay has the highest interest of any South American country in job related relocations from other countries, as of August 05 2013.

Because the only thing everybody in the world wants to do is smoke weed, it's not like most people have higher priorities like family and their careers, nope it's literally weed.

It goes on and on. This thread is a prime example of why people think stoners are a joke, these people are actually saying that moving to a country where weed is cheap and legal is more important than anything else. I like smoking weed occasionally, it's good fun, but the way reddit jerks about it you'd think it could cure cancer and give you superpowers with zero negative affects. 

Though because all these people value weed so much I can't imagine any of them getting off their arses and leaving the country because that would require far far too much effort for your average stoner.

Top comment...

&gt;The ones I hate the most are when they take a common name and spell it wrong.
Edit: TIL there are even more fucked up names than I thought... the world is doomed.
Edit2: I would also like to say that I try not to immediately judge people on their misspelled names... especially if they know I'll have to type it in and they go ahead and give me fair warning that's it's a weird spelling. If I spend a week trying to find a Michael in the company directory that ends up being spelled Mykel, I can't be held responsible for what I may do. That said, I do immediately assume they were raised by absolute idiots.

I like this series of backpedalling, you can see that somewhere someone must have implied that this person was being overly judgemental, to which they reply, ""No, I try not to be immediately judge people... That said, I do immediately assume they were raised by absolute idiots."" So progressive, bro.

I was going to carefully dissect every comment in CB fashion, but fuck it. There's no reason to. It's just people making fun of unconventional spellings of conventional names, unconventional names with conventional spellings, and, underlying all of it, a heavy dose of racism. Actually...

&gt;♪ In the Ghettoooo...♫

Sings one insightful individual.

As for black people (because it's black people we're talking about here)...

&gt;I'm an EMT in an urban environment and we have to gather a bunch of the patient's info for our PCRs (reports). I have ceased to be surprised at how many different ways there are to spell Lashonda or Shaniqua, etc.. I used to think the parents were trying to make their spelling unique, but then I realized many just don't know how to spell the unique names they've heard. If you research these names you quickly find that most don't have a 'proper' etymology behind them and are just combinations of interesting sounding phonetics. So who's to say what is the correct spelling at all?

HA. Black parents are illiterate, stupid, and so unbelievably non-conventional that their names don't even have proper *etymologys* behind them! WTF? Don't you know that ""decimate"" means ""to cut by 1/10,"" and etymology is literally meaning, and if you aren't being etymological you're just making shit up?

Blah blah blah...

&gt;Why do people seem unable to notice when they're in the middle of a fad? That any significant deviation from generally accepted styles and tastes will, in fairly short fashion, be forgotten or laughed at.

Because naming every white American ""Bob"" and ""Bill"" for an entire generation isn't a ""fad"" of its own - it's just ""generally accepted style and taste,"" which, of course, are universally true and eternal and unchanging. What about the ""Britneys"" and ""Jasons"" of the 90's? (Courtesy Hercules^TM for that one)

On a different note, check out this repentant soul:

&gt;My son's name is Anders. In all honesty, I named him after the lead singer of In Flames (I was twenty, not the best reason but I still over the name), but it seems to be quite an every day name in Scandinavia. People always think his name is ""Andreas"" and just can't get down his name even though I think it looks fairly obvious. I hope I didn't make a terrible mistake. : /

Reddit *rushes* to this person's aid, assuring them that Anders is a perfectly natural, normal, decent, civilized name - there's a character in a popular workplace comedy named ""Anders,"" after all! It MUST be normal!

FUCK! Reddit pisses me off! HOW DARE YOU SPELL YOUR NAME WITH DIFFERENT LETTERS THAN ME!!!!! YOU ARE ILLITERATE, STUPID, UNFIT FOR CHILDREARING, FOLLOWING A FAD, IN THE GHETTO, AND DOWNRIGHT UNCIVILIZED!!!

It's weird, because like, for a people who are all ""moral relativism"" and ""multiculturalism"" and everything, they somehow can't grasp that naming conventions are just as relative/arbitrary as anything else, and just about the least important thing to judge someone's entire existence on.

As a Texan with several friends that belong to illegal families, I understand her frustration. Mr friends can't get a driver's license, they can't apply for several government services, and applying for college is a bitch, not to mention the fear of being discovered.

The general consensus in that thread though is that illegal immigrants are cheating criminals who don't deserve amnesty of any sort. While I strongly disagree with that, it's not an invalid opinion. Over time though, it's clear that most redditors are just mad because someone suggested that weed isn't the most important political issue of our generation. 

&gt;I don't really get this movement to just allow whoever the fuck to be a US citizen. What 1st world country does that? 

&gt;Also, it could be argued that ending the 'War on Drugs' would improve the quality of life below the US/Mexico border, which is presumably what most people are trying to escape when they come to the US. [+206]

DAE think the drug war is entirely fueled by Americans smoking pot, and there are no other political or economic issues in Mexico?

&gt;Our country would be better off without the millions spent on the drug war and imprisoning drug dealers than it would granting amnesty.
Just saying. [+109]

""I don't see why we prosecute drug dealers when Mexicans are the real criminals here""

&gt;Seal up the borders and kick the illegals out. THEN if they want to come back - they can do it the way my wifes family did .... LEGALLY.

I do believe in legalizing marijuana, and I know that immigration is a complex issue with legitimate arguments on both sides, but threads like this further illustrate reddit's uniquely selfish brand of liberalism. To issues that affect them, (marijuana, internet freedom, student loans, free health care) the government should be as generous and liberal as possible, but to issues that don't directly affect them, (immigration, welfare, minority and women's issues) you're on your own and fuck you for asking for my sympathy.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,1367790484.0,,,True,t3_1dr3bx,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1dr3bx/reddits_solution_to_immigration_reform_legalize/,

http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1clv1d/went_to_an_atheist_intervention_disguised_as_a/

Standard fare for /r/atheism, I know, but a particular chain of comments caught my eye.  The first reply OP gives and this guy latches on to give OP some truly life-saving advice.

&gt; If I were you, I would cut off all contact with these family members. They don't respect you, and now you know they can't be trusted. Moreover, they're looney, and looney people are capable of great horrors.

Not an overreaction at all in the eyes of the ratheists, as this is currently sitting at +173.

A quick thought: what would happen if the tables were turned and the family members of these brave atheists had grown tired of their relentless Facebook arguments and meme crusades and decided to cut contact entirely with them.  Of course, we would never hear the end of it, these people are entitled to their opinions after all, and being an atheist of course does not make you a bad person, *right?*

Of course, staging an intervention under false pretenses is a bit more extreme than Facebook euphoria, but I can't be the only one who thinks this is an extreme reaction considering that the only sparse information given to us about OP's family was delivered via image macro.

He continues with this:

&gt; And if you have children, looney religious family members aren't above lying in order to wrestle you for custody of your children. They are, after all, acting in the belief that they are saving the immortal souls of your children from a parent consumed by evil. Move far, far away.

Yup, that's right OP, pack up your life and move because your hilariously theistic family pulled some Seinfeld-style sitcom shit. Unless you want to make that sacrifice in order to get some more gems to post for karma

Highest upvoted response to the previous comment at +64, this guy articulates very well what I was thinking.  It is interesting that he doesn't get downvoted into oblivion.

&gt; This may all be true.
This may all be false.
All you know is that they lied about a Tupperware party. Let's not assume that they are crazy enough to wrestle for child custody or that they are capable of ""great horrors"". Cutting all contact is over the top for their actions so far.

The response to this comment starts off with some lovely pretension at +29.
&gt; I'm wondering how much you know about how our legal system works in reality.

*Obviously,* that commenter has not paid enough attention to the deteriorating state of atheists' rights, amirite?

He continues with a laundry list of uncited example of atheists getting screwed by the legal system.  It's not like 20% of the population of this country is nonreligious and these events are outliers unlikely to affect OP even if his family is a bunch of malicious cunts. As you can see he is getting pretty far into the realm of improbability here. 

He continues his dissertation by ***blaming OP for coming out as an atheist to her theist family.***

&gt; OP is partially at fault here for living near such religious family in the first place yet letting said family know about her atheism.

So yeah, you can't trust your theist family according to /r/atheism, they will try to take your kids away from and screw you over in any way possible.

Just to recap, I want to go through the logical process of these comments.  OP's family lies about a tupperware party to get OP to go to an intervention where they drop /r/atheism-caliber gems of religious stupidity.  /r/atheists use this as irrefutable evidence that her family is crazy.  A crazy family means that they will try to take your kids.  A religious crazy family trying to take your family means that they can certainly succeed under circumstances that they fail to specify in their argument.  

Moreover, it is OP's fault for merely providing them the opportunity to enact their evil theist schemes.  OP had to have known that this would happen.

Religious people/republicans suck, libertarians suck, etc. But what we all like to see is that of the eugenics jerk. I can't help but wonder if the divided response to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1akwtf/what_opinion_of_yours_is_very_unpopular/c8ycfnw) comment is evidence that Reddit is beginning to shy away from the mentality of outright murdering people they claim inferior. It's unlike Reddit to ever be anything other than controversial, (and deluded.) Although, I feel that it's likely the above claim is worth exploring. 

I'm going to link the comment again, but this time I'm going to quote it, because I feel that it's needed to explore the above question.

&gt; [People with debilitating mental disorders should be euthanized.

Now by his own admission, he says that he changed the word from ""killed"" to ""euthanize."" This is an important distinction when you're attempting to advocate genocide. It's pretty likely that he's feeling rather down because his unpopular opinion isn't so popular, even on Reddit. I don't know if you've noticed, but involuntary euthanasia is rather, well, illegal. There's a good reason for that, which is basically the fact that it's murder. However, our friend Mr. Genetics want to show us his that he *feels* bad about murdering people with this comment:

&gt; [Right? I feel terrible about it, because they're generally happy people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1akwtf/what_opinion_of_yours_is_very_unpopular/c8ycqkn)

Oh well, that's good. I'm so glad that you're torn about murdering those cheeky people because you think their IQ is too low, or something. I just have one question, if you feel terrible about committing murder, **Why are you trying to commit murder?** Is it because you have an unchecked superiority complex and haven't gone outside to realize that you're not really that intelligent, and that looking down on people you claim are mentally inferior is wrong? Or is it because you hate disabled people? Do you think them subhuman? Are you that selfish? Do you really think that that's the kind of mindset that you should occupy your time with? Or is it both reasons? Are you the kind of person who, if given the chance, would sign legislation into law with the intent of mass genocide?

&gt; [I know. I doubt if I would support it if it were proposed as legislation, due to the obvious ethical issue, and I don't live out this opinion in my daily life, but it's still my opinion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1akwtf/what_opinion_of_yours_is_very_unpopular/c8ycz0j)

I think that we should kill all jews, *buuuut* I don't really try to kill jews everyday. Oh, well it's good that you let us know that! We're so glad that you clarified this issue for us. We're very grateful. Now, before I move on the next enlightened quote, I want to delve into every reason why this quote is insane. This guy claims he wouldn't support involuntary euthanasia if it were proposed as legislation. Why? Well, because of the ethical issues of course. Well that's good to know. Because I would like to know why you think that eugenics on the mentally ill is a good idea if you think murder is so immoral? Did you purposely forget to fill us in? But then he gives us two interesting words to contemplate: ""I doubt."" As in, he doubts that he would support legislated **MURDER.** As in, he could be persuaded into making it happen, in that he still has conflicted feelings about killing people. Well, I've been writing about this comment for too long. I better move on. 

&gt; [As a genetics major, I can't help but kind of agree with you as much as I hate myself for it.
We as a species are severely inbred and unhealthy, and in the ""wild"" so many people would have been killed off by natural selection already but because of better medical treatments and societal tolerance for mental handicaps such people are still alive and breeding. These harmful genes are being kept in our gene pool and fucking up our species quite frankly. We have a serious over population issue and yet were saving people that aren't contributing to the species in any way. I very honestly think there should be an IQ cut off for breeding or something. But I also sound like a complete ass saying this out loud, hence why I normally keep these opinions to myself. Also, people seem to often be more concerned with keeping functionally below-normal level people alive in 1st world counties much more so than helping all the people in 3rd world countries, I think people's priorities are seriously off here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1akwtf/what_opinion_of_yours_is_very_unpopular/c8yf10m)

A eugenics major with 10 upvotes. Well, good for you! I'm glad you're here to enlighten us with what you've read on Wikipedia! Let's begin! I want to draw attention to this quote here:

&gt; In the ""wild"" so many people would have been killed off by natural selection already but because of better medical treatments and societal tolerance for mental handicaps such people are still alive and breeding.

There are so many things wrong with that statement I don't even want to go into it. I can't even believe I just read that. He goes on to say that the genes of the mentally handicapped are poisoning the gene pool and making our race suffer. I don't even know what to say to that. 

&gt; We have a serious over population issue and yet were saving people that aren't contributing to the species in any way. 

It's frankly ludicrous that this hasn't been downvoted to oblivion. Forget my original question, I can clearly see that Reddit hasn't changed at all. I really can't see how high school students that are living off of their parents, (sometimes not even high school students at all) can even begin to suggest that the above quote has any merit. Society works through cooperation, we all have people we depend on, and people who depend on us. It's not about mental handicaps, it's having some f*cking human empathy! This isn't funny! 

&gt; [I believed euthanized is the word you're looking for. Though the action and result are probably the same, it shows a difference in your perspective. From the reader's point of view, ""killed"" sounds like you're disgusted and want them gone to get them out of your sight, but ""euthanized"" shows you believe they're suffering too much and should be given a chance to end the suffering. Of course I'm only guessing at your intention, and I'd like to think the best. Either way, props for bravely stating your opinion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1akwtf/what_opinion_of_yours_is_very_unpopular/c8yd93l)

**WHY DON'T THESE PEOPLE REALIZE THAT THEY ARE BOTH MURDER?** There isn't some difference between what the two words mean! Involuntary euthanasia is murder! There is no difference? End of discussion! How can you even be in the same room with a person who thinks that killing disabled people is a good idea? 

&gt; [I'm actually totally for it too. In the back of my mind. I know. That mean blah blah. No, seriously, if I knew I was going to have a schizophrenic kid, i'd abort it. My uncle is a paranoid schizophrenic and I've seen what it does to the whole family. No, I won't put my family through that or myself.

How can anyone be this arrogant? Is that baby somehow unworthy of living? Do you have preconceived standard of intelligence that you think justifies infanticide because you think it below you? Are you insane?

&gt; [Having a brother who is mentally ill beyond repair, I have to painfully agree with you. His schizo and highly manic bipolar disorder is tearing my family apart and he aggressively refuses to seek help. Sometimes I just wish he was euthanized :'(](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1akwtf/what_opinion_of_yours_is_very_unpopular/c8yfbdd)

Okay, I understand part of where this person is coming from. The part I don't understand is when you would want YOUR OWN BROTHER dead, because of how much of a burden he is on the family. I can tell you, being a parent is hard. It's difficult, sometimes it can even make you wonder why you ever decided to have kids. Raising a disabled kid is even tougher. But you should never **EVER** let that justify murder. If you do, then you are even more mentally incapacitated then your brother ever was!

&gt; [I think eugenics is the answer. You should have a licence to breed, also if you have a more than 50% chance of having a mentally ill child you should not be allowed to have them. Evolution has stopped rewarding the smart, so maybe we should help.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1akwtf/what_opinion_of_yours_is_very_unpopular/c8yebo4)

**THIS. HAS. TO. STOP.** Can you imagine if people were ever forcibly sterilized? Do you think you would like it too? Do you think that you're going to be the one that is so enlightened that the U.S. government will just hand you a list of names and ask who gets a permit? How much of a deluded monster can you be?

&gt; [I'll bite.
It's the same reason some people chose to take their own lives instead of living out the rest of their lives bed-ridden or hooked up to some machine. The quality of life for people with debilitating mental disorders is very, very low. And I can't help but feel for the parents/caretakers of kids with severe autism, because they COULD be living their lives to their potential, but they sadly can't, because they have to take care of their child. And I know they'd say ""We wouldn't trade him/her for the world"", but I bet deep down, they do wish they had full lives without their autistic child.
There's also the whole ""they don't contribute to society"" aspect of it. There are people with disabilities working and living and participating in society as a whole, but for those who are completely mentally disabled and who can't work, it almost feels like they give nothing back. They simply exist, and that puts a burden on their families or whoever is taking care of them.
I'm pretty sure that's everything.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1akwtf/what_opinion_of_yours_is_very_unpopular/c8yf083)

Yes, it is a burden to take care of an autistic child. It is a burden to take care of an normal child. And even though that they may never reach the level of the other kids, you still love them, and you still do everything to make sure that they have the chance to be the best that they can be. And even if they never contribute to society, you should never think about how nice it would be if they were aborted or whatever. They're your kid, and if you had one you would understand.

Finally, the original commenter makes a reprise. Let's wrap things up:

&gt; [I never said I was disgusted by the mentally handicapped. If anything, I'm more empathetic than most, because despite my opinions and feelings, I treat them like I would anyone else, because they're still human and they can't help or be held responsible for their condition. My feelings on this subject are based completely on the effect their condition has on those who are forced to support them for their entire lives.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1akwtf/what_opinion_of_yours_is_very_unpopular/c8yfnqb)

I've never written a post this long before. So I apologize if it's not completely up to Circlebroke standards. It just feels good to contribute is all. 

Concerning the above comment, well, it's not like this guy is going to change his mind anyway. If he cares more about the burden another human places on another, rather than actual human life, then I can't say I ever want to meet him.

The Armenian genocide one is a pretty good point, actually.

The third comment down is the old 'slavery wasn't all whites on black' with a [twist](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/110ogl/whats_the_most_offensive_fact_you_know/c6ib987.):

Dear god (sagan), this is pretty stupid. Basically, there is a scene from ""The Dictator"" where a dictatorship is compared to the United States. Of course, this is political hyperbole, so it gets posted on Reddit, where it gets over 2,593 upvotes (at the moment)!

I don't even care if you are liberal or conservative! Politics should be posted in a political subreddit, not /r/funny (even the rules state ""no politics"")!

The first comment agrees with my sentiments: http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/yurbm/the_dictators_view_on_america/c5z0a8x

But then these comments annoy me: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/yurbm/the_dictators_view_on_america/c5yzzhn

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/yurbm/the_dictators_view_on_america/c5z08q5

This is the definition of a dictatorship: 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator

""A dictator is a ruler (e.g. absolutist or autocratic) who assumes sole and absolute power (sometimes, but not always, with military control or bribes) but not officially sanctioned by heritage, as in an absolute monarch.""

So according to Reddit, a dictatorship is where:

* The rich have a lot of wealth (OMG 1% OCCUPY!!!!)

* The rich are given tax cuts (which has nothing to do with being a dictatorship!!!). I don't even care if you believe that the rich should pay more taxes. It is stupid to think that just because they pay less taxes, the US is a dictatorship.

* Companies are bailed out (WHO CARES if the wall street dies and millions of people lose their jobs? Bailouts are BAD!!!)

* The media is secretly controlled by one person (sounds like /r/conspiracy lol)

* The media forces people to supports policies that are against their interests (LOL AMERIKKKANS ARE ALL BRAINWASHED BY MSM, AMIRITE? Source: ThingProgress, DailyKos, marijuanacurescancer.com)

* Wiretaps, and prison tortures occur (a legit complaint about US policy, but doesn't mean that the US is a dictatorship nevertheless).

* Certain racial groups go to prison (this one is really stupid. The US isn't actively suppressing a certain race!)

* Rigged elections (Depending on your opinion, the system may be flawed. But it isn't ""rigged,"" despite what Redditors say).

In the end, this is my opinion: 

I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR POLITICAL VIEWS! If you have an opinion about which policies are good and bad, good for you! But PLEASE don't act like we are in a police state/dictatorship!

Some people may wonder: Why do dictators get such a bad rap from others?

Probably because some modern dictators haven't done many good things lately:

/r/childfree, like /r/atheism, is one of those ""I don't even own a TV"" lifestyle choices that proponents just *need* an outlet for.  Unlike say veganism coming up when you're out to dinner, not having a child doesn't beget you from expressing why you really believe you're better off not having a child. You'll need [a platform and some bait](http://reddit.com).

The default mid-20's male answer is usually resent.  ""I don't want to resent the child"".  Leaving aside that it takes a really special caliber of person to actually *resent* their own child's existence, on the surface it's a solid argument.  It's a personal opinion, self-serving, and reads as it's in the best interest of the not-yet-a-kid.

So, if not wanting to resent your own child is the low-hanging fruit of /r/childfree, then certainly the top posts from that sub are evolved personal insights into its users reasoning for this lifestyle.

Obviously this is complete bait to Reddit (hence 2500 points), but I'm really surprised to see Reddit fall over itself congratulating China on being a logical, rational, atheist paradise.

The two top comments are about China's poaching problem, which, you know, I'm okay with. It does have a poaching problem. Obviously this isn't primarily what I'm concerned about, but it's worth adding to the conversation. But down a few comments and you get gems like [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1cshcr/china_says_aims_to_banish_superstition_promote/c9jkzhz):

&gt;The article and implementation of their policy aside.. Just imagine if a government actually stated this as an overall goal for society. Evidence over belief/ideology in policy... One can naively dream...

Ah, christ. 

&gt;I don't see what the problem is... Promoting knowledge and banishing superstition sounds like a worthy goal to me. I think we could use a bit of that kind of thinking here in the US.

Well...

&gt;What I see is winning.
We use negative connotation to describe it; it's not perfect either, but it is gaining serious ground and will leave us in the number two spot. 

&gt;Edit: Advocating education and science over mysticism as a nation is not totalitarianism.

Well, in this case, yes...

Until those fucktards stop trying to encourage ignorance, they get no sympathy and no freedom (And no Lt. Yar).

Well, that obviously fake test does not seem like valid grounds for abolishing the first amendment.

EDIT: Apparently that test isn't fake - it is, however, only used in homeschool and nothing else. I've seen way too many fake dumb tests on this website, oh my god.

&gt;Religion has continually proven to be a detriment to both the physical and the mental well-being of the people on this planet.
So yeah, you're damned right I agree with China on that part. You're not going to shame me into backing down on this. Until you fucktards start controlling your own, you can kiss my ass.

The reaction to the original iPad in these threads (and in the wider tech blogosphere at the time,) was quite poor, which is a good example of just how wrong tech geeks can misunderstand the average consumer's wants. There's also elements of the 'classic' Apple jerk in the thread, which I'll briefly touch on.

I'll start with [this](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/auuxp/the_ipad_no_flash_looks_like_a_big_itouch_with_an/) thread, whose title:
&gt; The iPad: no flash, looks like a big iTouch, with an iTouch interface. I'm underwhelmed.

sets the tone for the rest of the thread.

As you can see, the reaction to the iPad is resoundingly negative. We've got people attacking it as 'merely' being [a big iPod Touch](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/auuxp/the_ipad_no_flash_looks_like_a_big_itouch_with_an/c0jig3v) which [is for old people](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/auuxp/the_ipad_no_flash_looks_like_a_big_itouch_with_an/c0jii4y). More of the top comments attack the iPad for [not being enough 'computer'](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/auuxp/the_ipad_no_flash_looks_like_a_big_itouch_with_an/c0jiej9), misunderstanding their goals and target market, and (again) only suited for [teenagers and old people](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/auuxp/the_ipad_no_flash_looks_like_a_big_itouch_with_an/c0jj1pz). Further down, we have people calling Apple [fascists](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/auuxp/the_ipad_no_flash_looks_like_a_big_itouch_with_an/c0jie46), and people attacking the iPad for not being able to load [custom code](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/auuxp/the_ipad_no_flash_looks_like_a_big_itouch_with_an/c0jik6n), possibly the geekiest thing imaginable, and people attacking the iPad for not having [standardized processor architecture](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/auuxp/the_ipad_no_flash_looks_like_a_big_itouch_with_an/c0jilf0).

As you get further down, more people understand the target market for the iPad (a content-consumption device aimed at the average consumer, not tech geeks.)

Around the same time, we've got Reddit singing the praises of an [Android tablet company](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/bhmwm/android_tablet_gives_ipad_run_for_the_money/) that's since gone into obscurity.

[This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/bmnwq/ipad_users_have_you_noticed_these_problems_i/) talks about a list of problems with the iPad that was published on Yahoo News soon after the iPad's release (the article has since been deleted.) We've got pretty much the same jerk going on here. There's people waiting for the iPad sales to [crash and burn](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/bmnwq/ipad_users_have_you_noticed_these_problems_i/c0njf8l) (and when someone points out that it's been selling well, it's apparently just because of Apple fanboys snapping it up, which will stop soon.) There's also a guy accusing Apple of [killing Foxconn employees involved in leaks](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/bmnwq/ipad_users_have_you_noticed_these_problems_i/c0nj33q).

Anyway, I think I've established that there was a significant anti-iPad jerk around the time that the original iPad was released (I even found a thread complaining about [too many iPad threads](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/ax7o4/the_ipad_is_not_the_end_of_the_world_its_just_a/).)

The overwhelming negative reaction to the iPad is a good example of how wrong tech geeks can be about tech not aimed at them. This is one of the driving forces behind the anti-Apple jerk, and also present with some of the anti-Kinect and anti-Wii jerks; Nintendo gets a big pass for being the company that brought out Zelda and Mario - I haven't seen as much anti-Wii jerking here was I have seen elsewhere. Everyday consumers simply don't care that the iPad can't load custom code, is a closed system, or it's lack of RAM, they care about very different things - which Apple understands, and is why Apple is currently [the largest company on Earth, by market capitalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_corporations_by_market_capitalization#2012).

A similar attitude is found in the anti-casual gaming jerk (go to any Reddit thread about Farmville, or Angry Birds.) Some things simply aren't aimed at the 'geek' audience, it doesn't mean that they're bad products, or that they're going to fail. I suspect it ties to Reddit's entitlement, and also to the weird obsession they have with things that aren't aimed at them (Justin Beiber, Twilight, Farmville, etc.)

There's absolutely nothing wrong with smoking weed (I support recreational drug use), but when you make the choice to smoke marijuana (in areas where it has yet to be legalized), you are inherently opting for the possibility of being caught and charged with committing a crime.

Currently the top voted F7U12 post by over a thousand votes, this is a horrifically misogynist rage comic where Le Redditor Hero is in a bar being a nice guy, and since as we all know nice guys finish last, after asking a patron in the restaurant if he can buy her a drink, she shouts RAAAAAAAAAAAAAPE, creating a completely 100% false allegation of rape while also putting him firmly into the ""Friend Zone"". Thankfully the security guard understand Bros before Hos and ejects her from the bar because they have a No Bullshit policy, le trollface reddit. Presumably, afterwards, the Bouncer and the OP declare LE BACON NARWHALS AT MIDNIGHT and take turns having prison sex in the bathroom.

The comic's plot is obviously bullshit, this never happened, and it's the ultimate misogynist fantasy. A woman turns down a nice guy's advantages by being a conniving bitch, and an authority figure punishes her for her  insolance. It's awful, sexist pandering to the worst kind of Redditor. So let's see how the inevitable circlejerk that upvoted this post thousands of times plays out:

[What is one current trend that needs to be stopped](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1k39i4/what_is_one_current_trend_that_needs_to_be_stopped/) asks everyone to get in a circle and lend a hand.

First on the jerk list? Social media!
&gt; News organizations asking for viewers to tweet them.

**(+1038, -123)** and

&gt; The narcissistic desire to share every last, inane detail about your life via social media.

**(+1830, -378)** and **GOLD**. Apparently, people on Reddit don't know that they can actually choose NOT to engage in Twitter and Facebook, or that you can hide people you don't want to see. Let alone all the basement-dwellers who think the worst thing in life is learning trivial information about another human being's life.

Let's not forget that Reddit wants to feel superior to everyone else.

&gt;That being dumb is cool.

**(+1738, -351)** and

&gt; Thinking that being depressed/mentally ill is cool/quirky.

**(+288, -37)** Right, because it's a brand new fad that the slackers who party instead of studying happen to also be the cool kids. No, Reddit, it's not your intelligence that kept you from being cool; it's that you just aren't cool to begin with.

Who else do we hate? How about hipsters?

&gt; Wearing fake glasses.

**(+1455, -279)** Wearing accessories with your clothing is apparently a terrible fad, unless that clothing serves a purpose. As one reply states:

&gt; I had to explain my hatred of this to my SO the other day.

**(+161, -34)** That's right, this guy doesn't just want it to stop being a fad. He HATES it, probably as much a he hates Hitler and Christians. Again, the whole ""if you don't wear Doctor Who t-shirts and poorly fitted pants, you are a terrible person"" mentality.

We've made it pretty far in the thread without someone hating on Bieber and such... oh wait, there it is:

&gt; Fandoms wasting their life away making trending topics on twitter for a celebrity that they will never meet.

**(+241, -34)** Again, I want to point out that the thread asks for ""current fads,"" and apparently 90's kids think that there were no fans before Beliebers. But that would mean we can't be disgusted people spend their times liking things other people make. Trending a popular celebrity is something Reddit would NEVER do... until it's Nathan Fillion trying to get Firefly back on the air. Then it's acceptable.

Let's not forget a politicaljerk.

&gt; US politics and the ultra polarization of the two major political parties.

**(+1130, -204)** and **GOLD**

TIL ""current"" means ""past 250 years"" and that democracy is a ""fad."" I really can't grasp my head around why this is even spoken in the same breath as celebrities, Facebook, and hipsters... but this is Reddit.

Let's go back to Facebook for a sec, because I don't think we jerked on it enough.

&gt; ""Liking"" or ""sharing"" something on Facebook and feeling like you are actually helping or proving anything.

**(+280, -37)** Because if anybody knows anything about slactivism, it's Reddit. And nobody else is allowed to be a slactivist. It also goes back to the whole ""Reddit doesn't know how to choose not to use Facebook"" thing. Just like how Reddit doesn't know to not buy things in video games!

&gt; Microtransactions with video games. Especially to get stuff that isn't just cosmetic.

**(+338, -56)** I'm surprised DLCs and SimCity weren't mentioned. But if you look at the insane popularity of games like League of Legends which *survive* on microtransactions, it's really a short-term thinking to generally hate them entirely. Supporting free or cheap games is obviously dumb, though, even if you can get something nice in return. 

So what if someone actually likes a trend that Reddit hates, but still wants some of that juicy comment karma? Oh, there's room in the circle for that:

&gt; Reality TV, most of it. I do like some of it. [...] I'll be the first to admit, I am a sucker for some of the stupid shows, simply because we know they're fake and watch it for hilarity's sake.

**(+288, -50)** Translation: ""DAE hate Jersey Shore! I do... except I do like it for the same reason most the population likes it... but I still hate it because karma""


It's been at least 3 comments since we complained about Facebook and Twitter...
&gt; Hashtags. Hashtags everywhere.

**(+341, -55)** Apparently, having a concept that is popular, is convenient to use, is understandable, and ubiquitous is a terrible fad. #FireFly #NathanFillion #Browncoats 

I think we've jerked enough, and the thread is very sticky. So I just want to end with a comment that is either extremely ironic or very meta.

&gt; The trend of every generation thinking they are being original by hating stuff teens do.

**(+1324, -307)** Thank you /u/MuForceShoelace for summarizing essentially what this entire circlejerk is about: hating on things kids like because it's not Pokemon.

This is, of course, implying that America let's bankers do whatever they wish and jails anyone who speaks out against the government, which is exactly the sort of dystopian image of current American landscape that /r/conspiracy and /r/politics have been pushing. 

But I felt like I'd seen this sort of broad, ""US bad, everywhere else good"" generalization before. And, as /u/dazwah pointed out, I have. Many times. In fact, ""the opposite of what America does"" has become its own meme of sorts. Shall we?

Banks = bad. No exceptions. Any problem we might have can be solved by gutting banks for money and redistributing it in another places. Because any economist will tell you that banks exist solely to suck up money and oppress others and have no place in a healthy economic climate.

I mean, pretty much every /r/askreddit thread about ""unpopular views/opinions"" contains some comment from a brave Redditor who hates The Big Bang Theory.

Now, I've been on this site for little over a year, so I have read dozens of arguments about why The Big Bang Theory is a bad show. Basically, they can all be summed up as ""Well, it is a show for stupid people who like to make fun of smart people"". Literally, search for any thread about TBBT and you will find people making this argument again and again.

Now, I am not here to argue that TBBT is a great show or a good one. Frankly, I haven't seen that much of it. If you dislike it, that is completely valid.

What I am here to do is express my annoyance that these shitty arguments keep on getting upvoted again and again. Not only upvoted, but they get posted on fucking /r/bestof. I don't frequent /r/bestof, but from what I can tell it should be renamed /r/bestofthesameshitoverandoveragain.

So, without further delay, I present to you this steamy piece of circlejerking shit:

&gt;[ [community]Toribor explains why so many redditors hate The Big Bang Theory](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1645o2/toribor_explains_why_so_many_redditors_hate_the/)

I guess I shouldn't be surprised - this /u/Toribor guy is validating an opinion held by the hivemind on a subreddit (/r/community) dedicated to another television comedy that Redditors love. Of course he will get upvotes. But /r/bestof? Really? Well, let's see what is in the post.

&gt; Because the show isn't for nerds, it's for people who are sort of friends with nerds.

Yes, only stupid people like it. It makes fun of smart people. It stereotypes us smart people so stupid people can laugh at us. This is literally the same argument I have seen countless times.

&gt; All of the humor in the show relies on Sheldon being socially incompetent and just saying random things like ""That's crazier than trying to play battletoads!"" or ""That reminds me of my N64!"" or ""Blah blah something something Battlestar Gallactica!""

*All* of the humor? OK, so maybe he is exaggerating, but still - I have only seen a few episodes, but from what I have seen, that is far form ""*all* of the humor"". Also, while look-how-inept-Sheldon-is jokes are common, most of them involve Sheldon referencing some random scientific theory/law/whatnot, not simple references to Battlestar Galactica.

&gt; I love Community and I love Arrested Development.

Like I said, this guy is just validating the hivemind's opinions and reaping in the karma. As a side note, I love Arrested Development and I enjoy Community as well.

&gt; They are smart shows about dumb people

And we get back to the elitism. TBBT is a dumb show, and only dumb people like it so they can laugh at smart people and feel good about their dumb lives.

&gt; Ask yourself, who in TBBT is the audience meant to identify with?

Leonard. I've only seen a few episodes, but years of taking literature courses in high school have prepared be with the ability to identify these things called ""protagonists"". Leonard is clearly the main protagonist.

&gt; The answer is Penny

No it's not. Penny is a protagonist, and she is used to represent non-nerds, but Leonard is the main protagonist and is the person you are supposed to root for, which is why the first season is basically Leonard chasing Penny and finally succeeding.

&gt; In short, the show is a poor attempt at 'nerd-humor' by simply dropping references, creating intentionally awkward situations, and it has a god-awful laugh track.

I hate the laugh track, and I personally don't think the plots are as intelligently planned or as humorous as some other shows, but it isn't just a collection of random thrown-together references. And, plenty of the references are actually pretty intelligent - they talk about legitimate scientific theories quite a bit.

&gt; And I don't think that the people who do like it are idiots. I just wanted to explain that TBBT is a low-brow formulaic sitcom. Everyone has at least one shitty show like this that they enjoy. I just hate when it's hailed as better comedy than some other truly great shows out there.

I do truly believe that /u/Toribor doesn't hate people who like TBBT. Nevertheless, he clearly is looking down upon them. Calling it a low-brow show and implying that it is for dumb people and the occasional smart person who simply enjoys it as low-brow humor is clearly looking down upon the thought processes that go into liking TBBT.

Now, as I said a while ago, this argument is nothing original. If it was, I would excuse the fact that it got on /r/bestof. But it isn't. This argument has been made over and over again. Seriously, just glance through [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/o0zou/aka_every_episode_of_the_big_bang_theory/) - which also contains some light-hearted racism - [or through this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/100liq/what_are_movies_or_tv_shows_you_find_painfully/c69cd7x).

Now, I wouldn't be thorough if I pointed out that many people disagreed with /u/Toribor's thesis, because many did. I suppose I am just pretty amused by how a repetitive and stunningly dull critique of a tv show can get shit tons of upvotes and get linked to a subreddit that is supposed to be a collection of the Reddit's best and brightest.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_164qjp,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/164qjp/best_of_aka_the_same_old_shit_about_the_big_bang/,

Shitty_Watercolour. The novelty account that makes watercolor paintings. Just like Overly Attached Girlfriend SW is loved unconditionally by reddit even when so much drama swarms around him. 

In this thread we have all of the great jerks that come with every SW post.

Overall, a pretty tragic story. Long story short, a kid who was riding on the upper half of a double decker bus stuck his head out and was beheaded when the bus came up to a short bridge. Maybe not front page of /r/news material all things considered, but a very sad story.

How does reddit react? By calling him an idiot, making jokes, and just in general mocking him.

Well, probably not.  Rep. Mendez actually delivered a thoughtful devotional (abridged):

We share the same spectrum of potential for care, for compassion, for fear, for joy, for love... Carl Sagan once wrote, “For small creatures such as we, the vastness is bearable only through love.” ...Let us cherish and celebrate our shared humanness, our shared capacity for reason and compassion, our shared love for the people of our state... let us work together for a better Arizona.*

First of all, I'm not entirely sure what that post is doing there, but anyhow, let's move on. Basically, some man who was against gay marriage shot himself when a law in France legalizing it passed. Obviously, I think anyone would say suicide is an overreaction.  

That being said, here's what bothers me: I remember distinctly when Osama bin Laden was captured, that a large amount of people on reddit were talking about how we should not celebrate the death of another human. Now, I actually agree with this sentiment. However, no one (that I remember) was actually *defending* what bin Laden did. More disgusting, even, are the various bouts of Hitler apologies that I'm sure my fellow CBers are aware of. What sickens me is that this guy was neither a terrorist nor a genocidal maniac. He seems to have held views, which, even among those who are against gay marriage, seem a bit needlessly vitriolic. Regardless, maybe I'm just naive, but I only think it fair to extend the same courtesy I would to a TERRORIST, to someone who was, well, not a terrorist. 

Is tolerant(tm) and progressive(tm) Reddit now wishing death upon those they disagree with, and celebrating their demise?

So basically, Swedish prosecutors want to send a pirate to jail. I wonder what /r/technology has to say? 

Top comment:
&gt; Jail is there to protect the community from people who are threat to the people. It is not a punishment but a way to remove dangerous people from society.
Jail should not be used for:
Piracy (Arr Jim Lad) - copyright piracy that is, real pirates should be imprisoned.
Council tax arrears
Other debt
Non-payment of anything to anyone
Verbally expressing an opinion.
The justice system is there to protect the people, not the corporations nor country leaders.[+90,gold]

I love the last line, where he decides that corporations deserve no protection, because clearly only ""the people"" deserve protection under the law. 

Now, what do you think the response to this comment could be? Another anti-drm comment? NOPE. It's about drugs(of course.)

&gt;also victimless crimes.
taking drugs in your home alone, no jail[+17]

Then. someone replies to this with a contrary view and is downvoted. 

&gt;No, you are hurting people. You're creating demand for an illicit substance that funds drug wars and massacares. You may as well legalize them and let companies legally sell them[-2]

What could the well thought out response be? 

&gt;I don't think you get how the world works[+6]

CHECK AND MATE, DRUG WAR LACKEY!

Then, we have others criticizing how stupid the legal appeal system used by THE ENTIRE WESTERN WORLD is.

&gt;Gets busted, goes to court, gets fined. Appeals, higher fine. Prosecution appeals for jail time.
What kind of a fucked up court system allows the winner to appeal for a harsher sentence after 2 previous wins? Sounds like the winner can just keep driving the punishment higher until a judge says no.[+14] 

And then, it becomes time to break out the tin foil hats and begin building storm shelters for the impending anti piracy apocalypse. 

&gt;Seems like fascism is spreading through the north Europe[+5]

&gt;This is starting to sound a lot like the war on terror and war on drugs.[+5]

All in all, even though /r/technology was faced with an anti-piracy threat, they decided to ignore the whole piracy thing and decide that the real problem was that the legal system doesn't provide the citizens the rights they deserve.

Never heard anything similar on Reddit...

&gt;I don't like babies. I find them repulsive and I dont see why women get all crazy about a little monster that shits itself all day.

What?A person who hate babies,on reddit?

&gt;That it's okay for guys to hit girls. Domestic violence, obviously, isn't okay. But it's the same fucks who preach about equal rights and then say men shouldn't ever lay a finger on us, even though.. that's not having equal rights. I've seen girls slapping the crap out of their boyfriends and the using the 'I'm a girl, you can't hit me' line as an excuse. I'm a girl and if I hit anyone, regardless of gender, I won't be suprised if I get a smack back.

As a woman,I'm not a die hard feminist

&gt;I think rape has to be proven, rather than assumed.

Because of those crazy women who pretend they were raped all the time

&gt;That before WW2 officially begun, Hitler was a good person.

DAE think Hitler was a fine gentleman?

&gt;I believe it would be better for life on Earth and better for humanity if stupid people were not allowed to reproduce.

Because I'm so better than everybody,I should choose who can't breed or not

&gt;More restaurants need to ban families with young (&lt;=6 y.o.) children.

Right,*all* children are little demons who can't behave.

&gt;Verbal bullying is freedom of speech and should be tolerated, you have a right to an opinion no matter how fucked up it may be or how many people it offends. It is your actions that should be careful.

The good o'l ""freedom of speech"" comment,because saying mean things to others do no harm.

&gt;Kids shouldn't be forced into going to church, if they don't want to go, don't make them go.

Poor kids :(

&gt;I think that humans aren't better in any way than other animals and so i don't consider their lives more important than those of other animals.

LOL if I could save a kitten over a kid I'd not feel bad,like,**at all**

&gt;not everyone should be allowed to have children

I think there's a world for that,but I must have forgot it.

&gt;I'm a woman and I dislike children, babies and entitled parents blasting me with the ""joys of motherhood"" bullshit

I am both flabbergasted and a astounded by this very statement.

And it go on. People with special needs should be killed at birth,they should not be allowed at restaurants,fat people hate,equal rights to the extreme,etc. Opinions definitely not controversial on Reddit.

I genuinely didn't know which subreddit I was on for most of my time reading the comments, which is to be expected given that it's a default subreddit. I won't pretend to think that Mother Teresa was a total saint, but this circlejerk has been long overdone. A couple comments higher up call out some of the BS here, but it's still discouraging.

They ARE from SA, after all, no matter how much they will try to make you forget.

Yeah, nevermind the fact that the vast majority of its members have come from reddit, and that it's been that way for a while now.

Hope you've been looking at the scores on these comments, by the way. [Here's a top-level one](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1198zm/rcreepshots_has_been_removed_due_to_doxxing_of/c6kf1ct) from /u/tarraingmobod that was second from the top the first time I checked (now at 4th):

Also from the same user is [this follow-up comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1198zm/rcreepshots_has_been_removed_due_to_doxxing_of/c6kfie1):

&gt;It seems to me they already have. Over and over again srs learns the lesson about doxxing, and over and over again they do it anyhow. As a generic human I feel actually very bad for them; they honestly don't appear to realize the severity of what they're doing. This is the ""bigger and bigger gun"" game, and fuck knows srs doesn't have access to the sort of nukes that their targets do.

Yeah, more unsubstantiated claims that SRS is doing the doxxing. This one's sitting at +63|-12 at the time of writing. Oh, SRD...

I sure am glad to see that he's calling out this guy on his shit and -- oh, wait, he's sitting at +39|-42. How dare he ask for proof.

When I first discovered Circlejerk I was scrolling through the pages laughing my ass off at the brilliantly clever satire of /r/politics or r/atheism's stupidity. But over time those posts became difficult to find, as they were overrun but a completely different type of humor. ""CLICK LEFT TO TURN ON THE LIGHT BULB"" etc, etc reaching the top of the front page. There are no posts on Reddit which blatantly ask the reader to click upvote, so I never enjoyed that prolific joke, which went on for months until the mods shut it down. Those have slowed down, but I still think most of the titles aren't very clever / satirical at all. [Mimicing a top AskReddit post and changing OP's question to make them retarded](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/uslab/for_months_i_thought_deleted_was_a_novelty/) is very popular lately. And I don't see why. In the AskReddit question, the person was acknowledging that it was a dumb question, that's the fucking point of the question. There's no joke there.

Then the comments. Despite mod intervention a couple months ago, ""Paul Sagan Tyson"" jokes are still going strong as ever. Not to mention that every time Paul gets brought up in even /r/politics he gets shot down now and his supporters ridiculed. Then there's the loads upon loads of jokes which just don't work. ""This"". I have never seen a ""this"" comment on mainstream Reddit which wasn't nuked with downvotes. 

Anyways, I don't even really know what direction I'm taking this. I was just surfing CJ recently and was disappointed in the content and felt like I should post here to see if anyone has insight or feels the same way.

The comment is, to me, what makes reddit such a great place: it allows people from different walks of life to have a platform to share their experiences, and hopefully create meaningful discussion between those who have had similar experiences and those who haven't.

But nevermind all that! [gross generalization] Why would your average redditor participate in an interesting discussion when they can instead turn the thread into DAE DRUGS!?! or a make a dumb joke to try to accumulate that sweet, sweet karma? [/gross generalization]

###Intro
  
---

I want to start off by making a comparison to the hatred reddit has for Justin Beiber. Beiber is torn apart in any comment thread about him. Most of the shallow complaints/insults you can imagine are coming from bitter, **adult** men.

I find it pathetic just as I do the Jaden hatred. But there is usually some small counter discussion compelling redditors to be mature, or pointing out that they shouldn't be discussing Beiber in the first place. You might call this an instance of critical self awareness amidst the circlejerk.

From what I've seen, less counter criticism crops up when the thread is about Jaden Smith. 

People really hate this kid.

###References

What I'm going to do is [search Jaden Smith](http://np.reddit.com/r/all/search?q=Jaden+Smith&amp;sort=top&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all) and filter by top submissions. I'll pick submissions featuring Jaden. Then I'll head to the comment section and quote the top comments that make mention of him. I will also check to see if there is any ""counter criticism"". I might not catch the most vile or extreme language picking the top comments like this, but I think it's fair. 

I will list the threads in the order they are filtered on the search page. I'll copy the submission title and give links to the comment sections for your convenience.

###Conclusion
  
---
You can see reddit dislikes this kid but I'm not sure I used the greatest method to show it. I wanted to stick with picking out the top comments rather than handpicking the worst ones. I do believe this was a fair approach.

If you would like to see the hatejerk in full form take a trip to some comment sections on threads created around the release of ""After Earth"". I seem to recall that was the height of the hate-frenzy.

I have some ideas about why reddit has such a distaste for him. I've ran out of energy though, my apologies. I hope someone can step up to the plate for me.

&gt;Much of the responsibility would shift to manufacturers in theory. The car itself would be safer and respond faster than you ever could, so even trying to take responsibility would be foolish as you would be more likely to get in an accident while driving. Hopefully accident rates would plummet though, as insurance would still exist, but be much cheaper, and would pay for the costs of repairs regardless of fault because accidents at that point would simply be accidents, impossible to plan for situations that even a computer couldn't detect or expect.

**. . . RIGHT!?!?!?!?**

The answer to that question, is no. Recently I was browsing /r/cringepics and I came across [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1aj5x1/more_photos_from_my_local_nightclub_enjoy/) abomination. 

Now, I'll admit, I visit /r/cringe and /r/cringepics on occassion. I usually just ignore things like this, but the nature of the post piqued my interest. For one thing, before I even clicked on the link, what I found curious is that the contributor must have visited the night club in question to get the pictures. If he's posting it in /r/cringepics, then it must be horrible (at least, he must think it horrible), and so by extension, wouldn't he deserve the same derision as the people visting it? But then, I'm assuming the people who post there aren't idiots.

The pictures are standard fare for /r/cringepics. Apparently the people in the pictures do not meet the NeckbeardSealOfApproval(tm) and are guilty of the crime of. . .not being ashamed of themselves and/or going outside? I'm honestly confused what the poster, and the commenters, are implying? Are overweight people not allowed to go to clubs? Are they not allowed to have fun? Look, I'll be honest, I am completely baffled by the mere concept of nightclubs, and I have no clue why *anyone* would ever want to go to one. That being said, for whatever reason, a fairly large amount of people *do* find them enjoyable. I imagine the people in these pictures, by virtue of their being there, are among those who do. So, just to be clear, what exactly is so wrong about these pictures? Psshh, who am I kidding? This *is* reddit. Such subhuman trash should clearly stay home in their cells so as to not offend the eyes of these logical scholar gentlemen. Besides, women obviously only go to clubs for men to ogle. And seeing as how that's the case, these women should clearly not be offending the sensibilities of our sci[ent]ist neckbeards by, you know, existing. 

But you're probably wondering where Sweden comes into this? Well, let's explore the ghetto that is the comments.

We have this scholar of superiority complexes to provide us with the insightful observation that [chics [sic] be fat](http://np.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1aj5x1/more_photos_from_my_local_nightclub_enjoy/c8y0qpy). Yeah, it sucks that women that are overweight have the audacity to go out in public. They should be confined to camps or something. A place where undesirable people could be concentrated, if you will.

What [starts](http://np.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1aj5x1/more_photos_from_my_local_nightclub_enjoy/c8y2gln) as a somewhat sane comment that not all clubs are totally filled with filthy subhumans, ends with a tantalizing first glance at a true, genuine, sweden-jerk in the wild.

But now for where the fun really begins! Our OP [tells](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1aj5x1/more_photos_from_my_local_nightclub_enjoy/c8xwzfe) us the saga of his immigration from the UK to glorious Neckbeardistan, Sweden. Apparently the album was made to show his ""colleagues"" (what a le gentlemen and scholar) in Sweden how superior their race is compared to his homeland. That, and a non-ironic description of Swedish girls as ""classy."" Yeah, those Swedish girls really do know how to devote their time to making themselves look appealing to random men. Stupid Brits need to take a page out of their book, I mean, that *is* the point of women going outside, isn't it?

The rest of the replies to the above are your standard fare of complete Nordic-pandering. That being said, [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1aj5x1/more_photos_from_my_local_nightclub_enjoy/c8xz6qv) gem really stuck out as particularly horrible. It's funny how everyone there seems to rate countries based on how attractive the people there are. Because, you know, clearly someone's self worth is defined by how he or she rates to some random internet neckbeard.

In defense of the new interface, which I personally don't have a problem with, is that if your computer is on Top of a Desk, you'll spend most time in DeskTop mode. The Start Menu doesn't really take too long to get used to. Everything else is pretty much the same on the surface (no pun intended), with improvements in the kernel and security.

But as is so blatantly obvious, [Windows 8 is clearly designed for Tablets only.](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/15nkrq/is_windows_8_adoption_rate_really_trailing_vistas/) We cannot accept the fact that Desktop versions of Windows 8 (i.e. any version except those on the Surface RT) have a Desktop Mode which works like Windows 7.

Only it doesn't, according to our enlightened Redditors. Even if there's Classic Shell, which basically gives you back the old Start Menu, if you say that, good luck getting your opinion heard because [*fuck you! You just can't!*](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/15nkrq/is_windows_8_adoption_rate_really_trailing_vistas/c7o9rzd). How dare you suggest that Windows 8 is in any way usable?

A subreddit littered with Facebook posts from *a few seconds ago* that will attempt to blast any religious follower back to the stone age.  The devout non-beliefs in /r/atheism will not fall for any man or god, unless of course they are handing out giftcards.  

Today, I just witnessed their masses drop to their knees in this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/15f91i/two_little_girls_just_walked_into_the_hotel_that/) where some Christmas worker was approached by two young girls, a greeting card, and the atheism Kyptonite: free burritos.

The card itself said:

&gt;May the love that was born

&gt;that silent, holy night

&gt;remain in your heart

&gt;throughout the year

The handwritten addition:

&gt;We're sorry you have to work on Christ's birthday so here's a little something just for you.  May God bless you on this joyous day.

A very nice gesture indeed, but normally you see the subscribers of /r/atheism flip out on anyone to even push Christ's birth on them.  But in those instances, you don't have a $10 gift card included for burritos.  Add that little incentive into the pot and now you have this follow-up...

&gt;Christians doing it right!

-

&gt;I agree! They are giving something useful (and soon to be tasty), spreading cheer to people working on Christmas, and not trying to convert people. Props to them for doing it right!

-

&gt;Yes, that's how you proselytize properly.  As evinced by how well it is received here.

-

&gt;Where I come from, the call this being, ""Christ-like"" and not just Christian.

-

&gt;This made me feel warm and fuzzy. At the same time, I couldn't help but hope that they gave some to some homeless people as well. :-)

-

&gt;Those little girls are the shit.

-

&gt;At first I thought it was just a nice note, which is nice. But then I saw the freebirds card and I was all ""Hey, that's even nicer.""

-

&gt;Faith in humanity slowly being restored today. If only people were this nice on non-holiday occasions it might be fully restored.

If only /r/atheism could be this nice on non-gift card believing.  If that gift card was instead a bible, the subreddit would have given a verbal lashing to these two little girls.  However, since it was free food, which is probably a cause for the neckbeards in /r/atheism, then today was a day of peace and love and accepting other people and their beliefs.  I really wish the atheists over there were actually this accepting and comfortable with other people and religion all the time.  But today, they were just sell outs.  

Edit: Sorry for the link going to that Walking Dead video.  A little too much Xmas spirits, I suppose.

On a serious note there were many calls for getting rid of the megathreads. Just a reminder that after the November elections there will be no more /r/politics megathread. That was more of a premptive move on our part to keep the front page from getting shitted up with links from /r/politics. 

There were also several suggestions for a ""Low Effort Friday"", so I would like to see what everyone things about that. 

As you see the winner of ""Silly Hats"" goes to GodOfAtheism. Even ArchangelleDworkin beat me out. Thanks a lot everyone :(

We're still in the process of going over the mod submissions. We were all a little taken aback by the number of applicants, and need time to go over all of them.

Lots of people died. They did so because gun control advocates brought up gun control, apparently.

The article makes no mention of gun control -- just the names, locations and times, plus the circumstances causing two little girls to be shot (v. sad!) -- but reddit knows better. This happened because of gun control.

Obviously, the dominant jerk is about ineffective gun laws. This weekend was proof that they are patently a bad idea, according to reddit.

&gt; I'm sure these were all guns that were used by their legal owners and were adhering to the new 7-round maximum magazine capacity.

Additionally, further down:

There's also a bit of a jerk about how much the Daily News sucks (which, ok, fine). Except this guy realized it was all probably somehow the government's attempt to keep down gun owners!

&gt; It's called fear mongering. It's something that Bloomberg is going to use to capitalize on the fear of his citizens to enact some retarded bullshit, I'm sure. [[+85](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1fkou6/25_people_shot_in_48_hours_over_the_weekend_in/cab92lr)]

But we're not talking about guns enough. Let's talk about guns. Incidentally, did you know that gun owners bring up gun control issues only because gun control advocates do? This thread does.

&gt; Whelp, GJ Governor Cuomo, your SAFE Act has really made NY safer. But wait, now gun control advocates will blame other states for not having as restrictive laws. I hope everyone realizes that gun rights advocates immediately start ragging on gun laws because gun control advocates immediately rag on gun ownership. [[+6](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1fkou6/25_people_shot_in_48_hours_over_the_weekend_in/cab8lhz)]

&gt; People rag on gun laws because the other side rags on gun ownership. [[+26](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1fkou6/25_people_shot_in_48_hours_over_the_weekend_in/cab8o5b)]

(That last one is a second child descended from the top comment, which of course is ragging on gun laws and not gun ownership.)

All of these comments spark bickering between people who all not only studied law but specifically researched these gun laws for years, but can't be bothered to go see if maybe they still have that ol' bibliography from the paper they wrote. Turns out gun laws are different *kinds* of laws than other laws, every single study says they don't work, and nobody would obey them anyway (because guns are just like fireworks). I'm not linking any of them. 

You know what else I'm not linking? All the racist weenies who decided this opportunity was best used as an occasion to complain about black people. 

So there you have it: redditors read about multiple shooting deaths in the poorer parts of my borough, as well as two shot little girls, and decide that the problems are the Daily News' lack of regard for life in their vocabulary and usage, all the PC police preventing them from disregarding these lives even though black people were involved, and the idea that not everyone wants a gun in every home.

Oh, and, weirdly, that Chicago is better because it's more violent. But hey, localism is one of reddit's weird little fetishes, so I'm not that interested in it.

Seeing jerks or bullies on film having the tables turned on them brings me a primal form of enjoyment usually only found in sex and a good meal.  Therefore, when I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/13p8yy/chris_hansen_attempts_to_ruin_daycare_owner/) at the top of the subreddit describing Chris Hansen and justice, I was expecting something good.

Because Hansen is one of reddit's favorite celebrities, what with his tired and overused meme where he is peering out from the side of the picture, accompanied by the all-too-familiar slogan ""Why don't you have a seat over there"" which is always visible multiple times on any thread that references an underage girl.

But after watching the video, I was immediately confused.  Hansen is shown interviewing a man who is trying to inherit his mother's daycare business... a man who has pled guilty in the past to battering women and evading the police and who apparently has some serious anger issues.  When Hansen asks him if he has a criminal past, the man says no, to which Hansen shows him his mugshot and the legal paperwork surrounding his past history.

Now for the justice:  The man gets really angry, defying his earlier claims of anger management success, and proceeds to curse Hansen out, flip him off and threaten him and his staff until they leave... end of video.  Still confused, I turned to the top comments to see what I was missing:

&gt; The guy turned himself around and kept his nose clean, Chris Hansen had no business trying to shame this man. I would have had the same reaction.

The guy lied and then got really angry when he got called out.  If you'd have the same reaction, you probably shouldn't be caring for small children either.

&gt; Like Hansen has room to talk, he totally cheated on his wife.

Yes, infidelity is the same of 2 counts of battery and evading police.

&gt; How is this justice?

And there lies the rub.  Apparently Hansen is NOT liked by reddit any longer, as the 1000+ upvotes of him getting yelled at seem to indicate.  In fact, people apparently dislike him so much, they lose all reason and think there is justice in seeing a man in a position of authority and guidance for small children lose control and yell at somebody like an angry teenager.

So consider yourself informed.  Chris Hansen is the new Dane Cook of comedy or the Nickelback of music.  We are all supposed to hate everything he does and stands for, and no matter what the context or subreddit is, we are to shame him with our upvotes.

reddit has always been particularly vocal in their dislike for Apple, particularly their dislike for rabid fanboyism - ironic, given that fanboyish anti-Apple rhetoric has become far more common than ""cult of Apple"" discussions. This dislike applies to Steve Jobs, as well, and especially so during and after his passing - the brave, counter-culture redditors had the courage to stand up and vocally protest Apple and Jobs when the media and others were mourning his passing.  
  
Particularly amusing is the ability of redditors to deny that Jobs accomplished much of anything at all, simply because they don't like him. His success was just due to being in the right place at the right time and screwing others over. This logic is applied to many of the figures reddit doesn't like, such as politicians and bankers, to name a few.  
  
Let's take a look at some choice excerpts:  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
*[topherhead 111 points 5 hours ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/z04uo/til_when_steve_jobs_accused_bill_gates_of/c60e2fk)*
&gt;I'm honestly not sure Jobs could code at all. He was a salesman and a designer. He was not a technical person I don't believe.    
  
111 points for a baseless, unsourced, and patently false accusation. An accusation which another redditor procedes to call out:  
  
*[dazonic 68 points 4 hours ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/z04uo/til_when_steve_jobs_accused_bill_gates_of/c60ek1h)*
&gt;You're wrong, he was very technical.

&gt;He [built a frequency counter](http://blog.eladgil.com/2011/09/12-year-old-steve-jobs-meets-bill.html) when he was 12.

&gt;He knew object-oriented programming was the future and needed to be the foundation of future operating systems as soon as he learned about it, again from Xerox, long before it was mainstream. He touches on it [in this interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=SaJp66ArJVI).

&gt;Eric Schmidt on Steve:

&gt;&gt; He was so passionate about object-oriented programming. He had this extraordinary depth. I have a PhD in this area, and he was so charismatic he could convince me of things I didn’t actually believe.
I should tell you this story. We’re in a meeting at NeXT, before Steve went back to Apple. I’ve got my chief scientist. After the meeting, we leave and try to unravel the argument to figure out where Steve was wrong—because he was obviously wrong. And we couldn’t do it. We’re standing in the parking lot. He sees us from his office, and he comes back out to argue with us some more. It was over a technical issue involving Objective C, a computer language. Why he would care about this was beyond me. I’ve never seen that kind of passion.

&gt;Eric Schmidt talks about this very argument in [this interview after Steve's death](http://www.bloomberg.com/video/77067952-google-s-schmidt-says-jobs-merged-art-science.html) (I believe the above quote is from here as well). He says something like:

&gt; Many people see Steve as a marketer and salesman and think he wasn't technically minded but this isn't true at all, he was incredibly so...

&gt;In [This 70min video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnO7D5UaDig) he talks about many programming technologies at Apple, it'll give you an idea of how technical he was.

So the two-line comment which makes a false claim discrediting Jobs (and therefore in-line with reddit's desired notions) has nearly double the karma of a factual comment which corrects this falsehood and manages to provide a number of sources to back up that claim. Phenomenal.  

&amp;nbsp;
  
Apparently the iPod wasn't any sort of an accomplishment, just lucky marketing buzz to convince the masses:  
  
*[vagrantwade 19 points 4 hours ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/z04uo/til_when_steve_jobs_accused_bill_gates_of/c60ef6r)*
&gt;You say that as if there weren't a hundred other companies with MP3 players out before the iPod. The iPod wasn't even a good MP3 player. It was kind of a piece of shit compared to some of the ones coming out of big Japanese companies. It was the influence of the media and celebrities that made the iPod as popular as it was. I doubt anyone envisioned it happening like that. Plus Wozniak.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Turns out that running a multi-billion dollar technology corporation doesn't require any technical inclination or skill. Jobs was just a hack fortunate enough to know reddit's beloved Woz:  
  
*[freshmaniac 22 points 4 hours ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/z04uo/til_when_steve_jobs_accused_bill_gates_of/c60ed45)*
&gt;&gt; I would bet everything I own that Bill spent more time programming than Steve Jobs ever did.

&gt;Well you'd be right, Steve Jobs as Wozniak put it ""has never programmed a line of code in his life"".

&gt;It amazes me in 2012 that people think Steve Jobs was an engineer or anyway technical, he was not. He was just a business man, he had no idea how this technology works. Steve Jobs was lucky enough to be Steve Wozniaks friend.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  

Here we learn that Jobs owes all of his success to Gates, something all the young'ns around here wouldn't know:  
  
*[mxzrxp 51 points 6 hours ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/z04uo/til_when_steve_jobs_accused_bill_gates_of/c60dro6)*  
&gt;as good as steve jobs was, gates just blew him away! jobs a very smart artsy guy and gates a pure businessman!

&gt;wasn't even until gates was out giving his money away that jobs stood a chance...  young ones will not even know that apple, moments from bankruptcy was saved by microsoft!

&gt;(to be fair ms needed apple so they woud not become a monopoly and be broken up!!) the good old days... :)

&gt;Xerox-Parc (Palo Alto Research Center) designed EVERYTHING you are using today! the mouse, all of it... amazingly they thought almost all of it had no future!  WOW!  
  
And the comment that calls out the incorrectness of this statement sits at a whopping one point, much like how the comment that disputes the false claim of Xerox inventing the mouse is resting at four points:  
  
*[Elliptical_Tangent 1 point 2 hours ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/z04uo/til_when_steve_jobs_accused_bill_gates_of/c60ezrq)*  
&gt;&gt;young ones will not even know that apple, moments from bankruptcy was saved by microsoft!

&gt;Because it's not true.

&gt;Apple was never bankrupt.  At the time in '97 when people were talking about Apple being bought or going out of business, they had in excess of $1billion in cash.  That's why nobody tried to take them over when they were hovering at $17/share.

&gt;I know because I made a killing buying Apple at that time.

&gt;&gt;(to be fair ms needed apple so they woud not become a monopoly and be broken up!!) the good old days... :)

&gt;Apple had no consideration in the monopoly case against MS.  If we'd had a Democrat elected in 2000, they would've been broken up as a monopoly - the case was too open and shut once they were found to be falsifying evidence.  But MS/Gates paid a lot of money to make sure a friendly executive in Justice would let the case slide.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
I don't believe that reddit should like have to like Jobs, or anyone else for that matter. There's plenty of reasons to dislike the guy. But it's utterly foolish to deny the accomplishments and success of one of the most influential figures in the world of technology, especially because he wasn't a true ""techie"" in line with reddit's eye.

I don't doubt that this story happened, but if I let it get to me every time a girl chose someone else over me at a club or bar, I would have given up a long time ago. Seriously, this comment just oozes defeat and bitterness.

I know some of you will take issue with his use of the term ""cunt"", but nonetheless andrewsmith comes in as something of a voice of reason with:

&gt;Not all girls are cunts.

Shortly followed by:

&gt;funniest joke I've read all day

This comment is highly upvoted and it's surrounded by other comments basically spewing the same sentiment: all women are clearly shallow cunts, mainly because they don't want to have sex with me. Never mind the fact that I would never deign to talk to an ugly or fat girl myself.

And the next comment thread, starts off with [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ykuyq/oblivious_hot_guy/c5whjry) predictable, but nonetheless reasonable comment:

&gt; Confidence is key.

This, of course, is quickly followed by many, many comments from sad, defeated neckbeards who have never done anything to try to better themselves and therefore blame all their problems on circumstances of birth (ugliness) or external factors (women, i.e. bitches). [This guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ykuyq/oblivious_hot_guy/c5wjc8e) comes in with a story that feeds right into those sentiments. Even if this story did happen as it's described (I certainly have my doubts), how are you going to let a few rude people embitter you towards an entire gender?

Finally, it wouldn't be reddit without [a terribly tasteless rape joke](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/ykuyq/oblivious_hot_guy/c5wipjk):

&gt; fuck confidence..just be strong enough to hold them down

God I fucking hate these people. They love to blame all their problems on things beyond their control. It's always the fault of friendzoning cunts, or the fact that they were born ugly. Never do they stop to consider that maybe it's a problem of attitude. The fatalism is truly mind-boggling. Sure there are people who just have unattractive faces and there's nothing to really be done about that, but I'd be willing to bet that most of these redditors who consider themselves ""ugly"" could get a lot more attractive with a little dose of personal hygiene and a few months of diet and exercise.

&gt;Then the police should leave the scene. They clearly fucked up shooting a suspect in the back. Then to aim your rubber bullets at children...that is too fucked up. Also, i don't see any of the ""rioters"" holding anything that could be considered a weapon, that would lead these donut munching asshats to use rubber bullets on women and children. 


Yes, clearly the surrounded police having shit thrown at them should have left the scene (like they were trying to do). Did I say police? I meant donut munching asshats.

First, examine the bravery of [their sidebar image](http://i.imgur.com/WEODa.jpg).

When many people think of modern communism, they are used to the anarcho-communist types that espouse the viewpoint that ""those governements weren't *really* communist, communism in it's truest form has never really been done"".  Although I feel that that sentiment is rather naive, the good intentions are there, and with some of these people you can usually stir up some intersting and productive debates, depening on who you talk with.  Let me assure you, /r/communism is *nothing* like that.  To get a better feel for what /r/communism is, we can start with this lovely piece of their [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/v1293/rcommunism_rules_and_guidelines_for_posting/) (the whole of which is entertaining):

&gt;This forum is for all Marxist communists. This includes those who identify as Marxist, Luxemburgist, Leninist, Trotskyist, Stalinist, Hoxhaist, Maoist, and probably other less common lines.

B-b-b-but that has to be a formality, surely people couldn't honestly defend Stalin or Mao?!  Wrong, son!  Check out [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/pbyaz/flair_descriptions/) sexy flairs.  Don't think anyone would wear them?  Wrong again!   Lots of Mao flairs all over the subreddit, no shortage of Stalin ones either!

So how far down does the ~~rabbit~~ shit hole go?  Let's find out!  First, for the easy pickins, their [top post ever](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/ri051/scumbag_pope_xpost_from_ratheism_this_belongs_here/) is a ""scumbag pope"" x-post from /r/atheism complete with image and superimposed text. [Second top post ever](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/vi983/i_love_election_years_in_the_us/) is another shitty image!

But that's the easy part, that just proves that some sort of shittiness, that only meets /r/atheism.  But how much more delusional do you have to be to get even jerkier?  Lots, and they manage to pull it off!

[Freedom of speech is opression!](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/wuq8f/since_communism_doesnt_support_freedom_of_speech/)

[Marxism=Science!](http://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/wrmcz/what_is_the_marxian_science/)
Sound familiar?  For those who don't know, Marx tried, and failed, to make a science out of human history and behavior.  With his awful tools at his disposal, he arrived at the Kant-ian conclusion of a ""natural progression of history"", a sort of Teleology that is remixed to be compatible with materialism.  Naturally, that ""natual progression"" always ends in worldwide communism.  This is played a great role in making communist regimes inflexible.  Here's a choice quote out of that shitpile:

&gt;Why shouldn’t marxism be a science? It would be entirely metaphysical to draw a line between the evolution of human social organization and the evolution of human anatomy or behaviour, and treat the explanations of former as somehow out of bounds of science while the latter are clearly included.

Apparently the principles behind genetic transfer are just as capable of explaining all of human behavior.  This is why you get sent to the Gulag for being against the state apparatus, *you are tainted socially*.

Next he'll be using nebulous and abstract terms such as ""food"", ""shelter"", and ""clothing"".

It's like if you take the most stereotypical right-wing view of what a communist is and brought it to life.

1373656165.0,100,self.circlebroke,1i677r,Minor rules updates and rearrangements,dhamster,120,20,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1i677r/minor_rules_updates_and_rearrangements/,"We have a more substantial mod post coming up in the next couple days, but for now I have some minor bookkeeping.   
  
**TL;DR:** Mouseover the sidebar, some rules have been updated. Read on for explanation.        
   
####Rules Rearrangements  
  
Previously, the rules for submitting a post and the rules for commenting on a post were lumped together in the ""Rules &amp; Guidelines"" section of the sidebar.   
  
Since many users browse CB without making a submission, the Rules &amp; Guidelines section has been split off into ""Submission Rules,"" which detail CB's submission requirements, and ""Community Guidelines"" that deal with commenting and voting. This should hopefully make the ruleset a little easier to parse through.  
    
####Meta Policy  
  
The only real change made to the rules was that the ""Meta"" rule was clarified for submissions, and updated for comments:  
  
&gt;* Discussion and criticism of CB belongs in /r/CirclebrokeDiscussion unless it suggests specific changes that can be implemented by the community or moderators.  
  
Under this rule, generic comments such as  
  
&gt;Does anyone else think Circlebroke is as much a circlejerk as the rest of reddit?  
  
...will be removed, but posts that identify problems and suggest a course of action, such as  
  
&gt;Why does /r/circlebroke always post about /r/apples? Why should we have to resort to picking such low-hanging fruit?  
  
...would be perfectly fine, since it's implicitly suggesting that the Circlebroke community stop posting about /r/apples so much.  
  
In short, if you think something's wrong with CB, attempt to identify the problem. Then, try and come up with a way to fix it.  
    
####Discuss the Discussion  
  
When commenting, please keep in mind the following guideline:  
  
&gt;* We ask that comments discuss reddit instead of the topic of reddit's discussion.  
  
The point of CB is to discuss reddit's attitudes toward and reactions to different topics. Consider a hypothetical fad on reddit where apple farmers are demonized, and orange growers are given the Neil DeGrasse Tyson treatment. Comments such as:      
  
&gt;I don't get it, last month Reddit was talking about apples like they were the greatest thing since sliced bread and all of a sudden they're worse than Hitler. How long will it be until oranges get thrown under the bus next?  
  
...would be on-topic, since they are talking about the treatment of apples and oranges on reddit. However, comments like:   
  
&gt;Actually, oranges are WAY BETTER than apples.   
  
...are off-topic and tend to drive subsequent replies off-topic, since the purpose of Circlebroke is not to argue the merits of apples and oranges, but to talk about reddit's attitudes toward these things.    
  
This guideline is not enforced firmly. Some topics will be controversial no matter what, and if you feel like a submission is legitimately misleading or otherwise off-base for reasons beyond simple disagreement, it's fine to explain why.   
  
However, attempting to bludgeon your point of view into a comment thread by contradicting every viewpoint different from your own will often lead to deleted comment chains.   
     
####New Mods  
  
Lastly, I don't think we announced this yet, but we recently added some new mods. Welcome to:    
  
/u/AutoModerator  
/u/splattypus  
/u/eyjafjallajoekull

A reader learns about this shortly after joining the subreddit.  Within a week, he's seeing questions from new users being posted, scrolling down until he sees the tidbit he learned about last week, upvotes that and downvotes everything unfamiliar to him.

The advice isn't even necessarily bad, but it's the fact that any alternative view gets silenced.

A couple examples:

/r/personalfinance : Retiring? Put everything in index funds.  Want to save for something in 10 years? Index funds.  Want to try for some short-term gains? OMG what are you doing that's insane.

Index funds are actually a pretty good investment vehicle, but they're certainly not the *only* valid one, and there are some downsides - see my posts [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ez3jx/are_market_index_funds_best_for_investing/ca56bd1) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1etawa/does_active_beat_passive_investing/ca4tkyb).

/r/fitness : Starting strength is apparently the only valid workout plan.  This sub is actually better than others, because I think a lot of users get their info elsewhere, but it's still got the same symptoms.

/r/malefashionadvice : chinos, allen edmonds and J Crew plaid shirts, don't even let me get started.

Anyway, I've started treating subreddits of this sort as good jumping-off points, and as I said the advice is often not a bad place to begin for someone who knows nothing.  However, I find that a lot of users don't realize the limitations of their knowledge, and think that any viewpoint that they haven't seen before *has* to be wrong.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_1ezgqk,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1ezgqk/does_anyone_else_get_aggravated_by_how_all_the/,

Here's a video from Jenna Marbles, who has popular youtube channel, originally called ""Draw My Life"". It was posted to /r/videos with the title [""Shockingly open, honest, sad video from Jenna Marbles](http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1b6tb0/shockingly_open_honest_sad_video_from_jenna/).

 Her life isn't filled with absolute heartbreaking horror, so some jimmies get seriously rustled.

&gt;Her life isn't sad. 

This is pretty much the tl;dr of this thread. Lets look at some more examples.
&gt;She actually describes a pretty easy, lucky life. After reading the youtube comments, it seems people think that you should just expect a painfree existence.

&gt;Many of us are fortunate enough to not have to deal with true hardship. The entitlement mentality we've developed makes it hard to see that.

Yup, thats it. Because she dared talk about her life honestly, that means that she is just an entitled bitch.

&gt;It's interesting how it's all about perspective. She might think she has nothing right now, where as someone from the outside might think she has everything.

&gt;If I were her. I would focus on acting and modeling and landing some sweet gigs outside of youtube.

This isn't the worst of the bunch but its just feeding in to the idea that because she's attractive, she should just model and become rich. How could she possibly not have an amazing life?

&gt;I hate these ""draw my life"" videos. They are overly dramatic and way too exagerated. You are making money off youtube videos, you are living a goddamn dream, your life isn't sad, stop this shit.

I don't think this guy actually watched the video because she wasn't being dramatic in the slightest.

&gt;Grows up with a mum and dad, goes fishing and hiking in the great outdoors, goes to uni, gets a masters, has a couple breakups.

&gt;My heart bleeds.

And some more.

&gt;If her life is 'sad' then my life is the great fucking depression.

&gt;Meh, this is just all 1st world problems. Dude broke up with you, that's life you'll live relax.

Yeah, I'm sure you're life is just oh-so miserable.

&gt;I expected deaths and some struggles. 

Really?

 I can't tell if they are mad because she's hot or if they are just overly pedantic about the title but its shit like this that really pisses me off on reddit.

Thankfully, some voices of reason arrived and has the top three comments. 

&gt;I wouldn't say shockingly but the video was open and honest. There's a bunch of negative nancys up in here. You can't expect everyone to have the same frame of reference for their lives. To her, those were truly sad moments in her life. To someone else, it may have been another tuesday.

Followed by...

&gt;This video struck a chord with me. But what makes this good is not because it's ""shockingly"" sad, it's because her life is completely normal. It tears away the mystique of the ""Youtube Celebrity"" and makes you realize ""hey, this person is exactly like me and they have no idea what they're doing either."" I feel like the older I get the more I realize that no one else has any idea what they're doing and they're all just going with the flow and using the tools they have and hoping everything just works out alright.

And this

&gt;After reading most of the top comments here, I feel like many people are missing the point.

&gt;She herself didn't say anything about having hardship or that her life was sad. She mentioned in the description that it turned out sadder than she'd expected, but she's not lamenting her horrible life or anything.

&gt;The overall point that came across to me is that she's like many other 20-somethings out there who have had good lives, great opportunities, some less-than-peachy moments, but are doing fine and just don't know where their lives are going next.

&gt;OP's title was misleading.

Its nice to see that not everyone is an idiot. 

Here's my contribution:

&gt;No, we all know that it is literally impossible for a hot girl to be sad. Their life is filled with perfection and they friendzone all of us nice guys!

I'm funny dammit!

To add onto that, Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected, and he is know for his negative views of uneven income distribution (which Reddit should love) and gay marriage (which Reddit should hate).

So much that /r/cringepics, which gained probably 50K subs in a few months despite its obscurity, was sitting at the top of my front page last night. Which, I imagine, means that it was probably sitting on the front page for a lot of people who weren't even subscribed to it. Kind of like how gonewild somehow winds up on the front page for non-subs (which is a whole 'nother write-up, but hey).

We could talk about how shitty the subs are; how inherently negative the community is and how shitty hands-off moderation can foster it; how it's basically aimed toward making fun of people for the decisions they make or the way they portray themselves; how the comment sections just turn into a smug circlejerk over the *~-.-xXxcringeynessxXx-.-~* and inferiority of ""autistics""; how the cringe reddits are the perfect example of the destruction of a community by cross-linking from bestof/SRD/whatever; how the userbase has a strong disposition against feminists/LGBT/friendzone/whatever; how /r/cringe's inherent flaw is that the users can go directly to the Youtube pages of the people involved and tell them to commit suicide; how I'm probably just railing against kids bullying kids; and so on, but we won't.

First I'll point out a common trend within the /r/cringepics reddit specifically: The comment sections of the posts usually devolve into text that was used in the pictures themselves. Some examples on the first page:

* [Link 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/18jviw/guy_lacking_social_skills_tries_his_luck_on/) Literally every god damn comment was text that was used in the post. Every comment. Literally. I'm not joking. The post netted 1500. All threads derailed into the word ""why"". I just want to hammer down the point that every fucking comment in this thread has no meat or wit to it. They're just using the text from the post as ""funny"" comments. Just saying.

* [Link 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/18j92r/meet_ahmed_angel_the_king_of_cringe/) which of course was sitting on the throne of my front page last night with over 2300 points. The reply to the top comment is text from the photos. The 2nd top comment at 1000 points is text from the photos. The 3rd thread starting at 700 points is text from the photos. The 4th thread is derailed by text from the photos. There's probably more but I didn't go down that far

* [Link 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/18jgt2/friend_zone_level_dumbass/) Post is at 1400. Top comment at 430 points is the -- seriously here -- second of only two sentences contained in the post. Meaning there are two sentences in the FB screenshot. One of them was used as a comment. That comment sits at the top.

And as long as we're talking about the cringe subs, I wanted to bring up the questions: Do these reddits have a crack at becoming defaults? What allows a sub to become defaulted? If /r/atheism (a sub dedicated not to pics, games, politics, tech, etc. but to a specific areligion) is a default, can other popular subs that have a rapidly growing userbase and posts that continuously net 1K+ become defaults? And if these posts (specifically designed to make fun of people using the subscriber home field advantage) are showing up on /r/all and getting upvoted to Saganspace, what does that say about the innate hubris or bullying tendencies of the users?

I'll also say that the word ""cringe"" has been plastered all over Reddit since these subs gained traction. I hate the word now.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_18l9u5,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/18l9u5/discussion_on_the_cringe_reddits/,

I think this whole thing is a joke. Yes that pastor was a huge bag of dicks, however that waitress posted a credit card receipt (a **very** personal piece of information) online. She knew fully well what would happen. There is no way that she didn't know that the reddit detectives would find the pastors name, address, business, twitter (for gods sake), and proceed to harass her.

It seems however that the general reddit sentiment is that she was wrongly fired and the anti applebees circlejerk continues.

All of the main applebees jerks are here...

&gt;""Applebees sucks anyways, overpriced dog food in my opinion. Just one more reason not to eat there. Oh and fuck that pastor too, another fucking worthless clergy member sucking air and not earning it.""

Here is the mandatory attack on religion.

&gt;""He stiffs a server on a tip, then gets her fired. I bet Jesus is just waiting with arms open to receive this special representative. ""In as much as you have done this to the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."" Oh, I guess maybe not.""

Not one person is willing to acknowledge that the waitress has done anything wrong by posting personal information online. Here a redditor claims that the pastor ""Cost the girl her job""... oh and he is an asshole for it too!

&gt;""Doesnt matter what divine retribution he gets after death, if any. In the here and now world of the living he is an asshole that cost a woman her job. Best part is I'm sure he feels massively justified in doing so.""

ITS A CONSPIRACY YOU GUISE! APPLE BEES JUST SHARES THE SAME BELIEFS AS THE PASTOR AND IS SUPPRESSING ATHIESTS!!!

""This is a good point - before we start hating on Applebee's, that client backed the restaurant into a corner with the complaint. They could have handled it more delicately, but given the geography of this little controversy **I suspect that the franchise owners's (if not the management's) views were more aligned with the Pastor's position than the server's.**""

Also, in regards to the above comment, how could they have handled it more delicately? If I in a managerial Applebees posistion the girl would be fired. I am the typical athiest liberal... you know all of those buzzwords and I STILL would have fired her ass. You simply don't do this. it is incredibly immature and dangerous. I AM IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AS WELL!!!! She still would have been fucking fired. This is like some weird alternate reality. Applebees could have called the police on her but they didn't. That's pretty delicate.

Meanwhile... in bizarro world. Here is the link about the credit companies selling user info. The comments here when taken with the above article not only contradict but are hilarious.

Needless to say, the comments are a spunkfest. Let us arrange them based on karma and comment from top to bottom:

___
[The first one is one showing naked opportunism and greed:](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/13xwk6/canada_creates_5000_cap_on_liability_for_file/c788dxy)

&gt;$100 dollar fine for stealing a blu-ray worth 20-50 bucks, or a game worth 60 bucks. This is actually a reasonable punishment.

&gt;A $5000 dollar max fine actually benefits those downloading. It essentially guarantees that it will be more expensive for the companies to go through litigation than they can earn from the lawsuit. They would be suing the individual to a point of bankrupting themselves if they went after everyone. And those who are set an example of have to pay out a non-life destroying sum.

&gt;As a Canadian who downloads content I have to say I am very happy about this news!

The law is reasonable because now it won't be possible to litigate.

___
[More greed](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/13xwk6/canada_creates_5000_cap_on_liability_for_file/c7887lg)

&gt;At 10$ per CD and 20$ per movie, that's:
500 CDs, or
250 movies
If you have downloaded more than that, they are actually making you a very good offer!
Although they'd probably have you delete all that stuff, so it might not be such a good idea...

Law is good because it gives you a good ""deal"" on illegal downloading, as if this was a government mandated sale...

[Further down](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/13xwk6/canada_creates_5000_cap_on_liability_for_file/c78am15)

&gt;This is what happens when you have a government that is not owned by corporations.

Unlike America, Canada is not ruled by Republicons and conservitards. Even if they call themselves conservative and r/canada hates Harpers guts for being Bush 2.0, we learn that

&gt;The irony is of course that this is the Conservative party of Canada that is introducing this law. Or as it would be known in America, the extremely extremely extremely far left party.

Yeah, this tired old soundbite again (tho conveniently, Harper tends to morph into Bush 2.0 again once we start talking of Kyoto, Climate and whenever anything goes wrong in Canada)

&gt;What a great day for Canada, and therefore, the world.

Introducing...

/u/LeReddits

Created 5 days ago and already with a score of -360 comment karma, the person behind this novelty account infuriates anybody and everybody with one simple goal. To replace any utterance of the word 'the' with 'le' and post it as an amendment to the comment he's replying to.

Once, Reddit was smitten with using 'le' in f7u12 comics, with such examples as 'le sploosh', 'le splash' and all that shit. Then 9gag or at least downvote farming trolls on reddit pretending to be from 9gag came in and were like ""OMG IT'S LE REDDITS xDDDDDDDDDD."" Eventually Reddit got so fed up with the phrase that even the mods of /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu tried [to ban the use of ""le"", ""moi"" and ""das""](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/11f8ii/reminder_comics_with_le_dasmoi_or_other_annoying/)

And now we've come full circle to see a novelty account created entirely for spreading the word of 'le reddits' to the populace, to their anger and disgust.

It happened with the Skyrim ""arrow to the knee"" meme and it happened with the ERMAHGERD meme too. Now let's watch it happen with reddit's obsession with le in rage comics.

&gt; Kill yourself.

No really, if replacing ""the"" with ""le"" is enough to rustle this guy's jimmies then I seriously question the temper of the community at large.

&gt; Back to /r/f7u12 with ye!

Yeah, let's forget the fact that f7u12 actually now **bans** any comic with utterances of 'le' or 'das'.... thus killing a trend they started and milked to death.

**Reddit** is making me **crazy**.

Everything is a **cliche**. An inside joke repeated ad infinitum. 

A clever comment is posted once. And then it is posted **again. And again. And again.**

The worst part is that reddit is also self aware. So someone will make **a clever comment referencing how the clever comment is a cliche**. And then *that* comment is made **again. And again. And again.**

Not only does this cycle continue in an endless chain of self reference, the _first two steps are also constantly repeated_ due to a constant stream of redditors new to a particular cliche that still find it clever and upvote.


Reddit's self awareness also supports *meta subreddits* that comment on and analyze this cycle. But I find little relief in these areas, because the meta subreddits fall victim to it as well:

~~When I first joined Reddit, I immediately unsubscribed from two default subreddits, the second being /r/trees.~~ I don't smoke weed, it's never really appealed to me. I ate a pot brownie once and was high for nine hours; never again. However, I respect one's decision to put whatever they want in their body. HOWEVER, if there was ever a sub to make me change my mind about that concept, it would be /r/trees.

In browsing /r/all today, I stumbled across a follow-up post to a raid that happened at the University of Alabama. [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/18w2l3/about_70_young_people_were_arrested_yesterday/) a link to the original article and [here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/19bsox/alabama_raid_update_the_campus_police_for_the/) a link to the follow-up. Long story short, 70 people ended up arrested over possession charges.

Now the students want to organize and protest the zero-tolerance policy that the university has on possession of illegal drugs. Now that's fine and dandy. However, in doing so, they didn't seek approval for the flyers used to promote the meeting. The university, seeing unapproved material being posted on it's property (well within its rights to do so), removed the offending items. 

/r/trees has proceeded to go apeshit, citing free speech (muh freedoms).

From the post

&gt;Several eye witnesses have confirmed that campus police are systematically removing all posters and fliers which call for organization or try to set up a meeting. Police are also actively ""trying to figure out who is putting them up"". This has to stop. They have every right to enforce marijuana prohibition, but using police resources to stifle free speech on a college campus is almost like some cartoonish super villainy. 

1) Eye witnesses, k.  
2) So the police are trying to find who put them up, BFD. The post would imply that the offending person/group would be hauled off to fucking Guantanamo, rather than be told ""hey, you can't put these up without permission"".  
3) NOBODY IS STIFLING YOUR FREE SPEECH

The top comment is a voice of reason, and what follows is a discussion on the rights of students when disseminating information.  

&gt;This confuses me. Even if weed were legal in your state wouldn't the University still have a zero tolerance policy? Campus is University property, don't they have the right to remove any posters they want?

&gt;They still have the right to assemble and attempt to ask for a reform.

&gt;Perhaps off campus, but if it's anything like USC they would have to get the fliers approved before putting them up. The university could be held liable for promoting weed reform and let's be honest about the deep South and old money with their view on a harmless plant

&gt;I've honestly never heard of a poster not getting approval in my 4 years here. Including fliers for protests against the university and recently a bdsm/bondage club that wanted to meet (on campus) and explore fantasies. Those posters were up for weeks without being taken down, while other unapproved posters were taken down. They probably filter out hate speech and overly vulgar pieces, but it seems to be very very rare. 

I was extremely impresses that I didn't have to dig for something like this in a default sub, but that feeling didn't last long.

&gt;UA is a state funded university so I believe that you can hang posters anywhere that posters are normally allowed as it is considered public property. +6

&gt;Might be ""University properties"" but every student there is paying to be their with THEIR money. The colleges run on those kids money. (I understand they receive donations and what not but still) It not high school, and you are forced to pay the outrageous tuition's they charge. They have no right to wreck and ruin all those lives before they are even started over something so stupid. Maybe if these kids were making meth labs in the dorm I'd understand. +5

I pay you to go here, you should be okay with me selling a plant that could cause the school to lose public funding.

&gt;Just because the campus has a zero tolerance policy doesn't mean they have to be dicks. +4

Tearing down posters = literally the next Kent State

My answer to this is technology. Use things like Facebook, reddit, Google+ and Hubski to do your organizing, so you don't have to worry about things like this. Alternatively, read your school's code of conduct or student's rights and responsibilities before jumping to conclusions about the police state coming to your university.

High level comment, sitting at +40 when I saw it: 

&gt; I don't really care about helmet hair, but I don't like wearing helmets because they're bulky, hot, heavy, and restrict head movement / visibility. It takes the 'fun' out of biking.
Plus there's no good way of dealing with the helmet when you get to your destination. You can't roll it up and put it in your pocket, or leave it with the bike. You have to carry it around and it's another thing to worry about.
I mean, all of this sounds like a minor inconvenience, and it is, but I was on the fence about biking anyway. This just gives me a reason not to.
On the other hand, I hear stories from time to time about someone who fell down and left a huge gash in his helmet. I wonder if that huge gash would be in his head if not for the helmet. It's hard to say for sure because the physics change a lot with a helmet. Your head is bigger, heavier, and made of a different material with a helmet. It might also change the psychology of falling (I need to protect my head less and my elbows more...), plus helmets are designed to break after they hit something.

&gt; Depending on your injury, you are affecting people other than yourself.
What about if you fall and suffer head trauma to the point you are now in a vegetative state?

It's an egregious thread because it completely fails to engage with the source material, but also because several jerks within combine into one completely useless megajerk: 

* In my country we do it this way, in your country you are wrong 

* Anecdata being presented and upvoted as if it is completely relevant. Getting off topic is totally fine, because it means there's more anecdotes to be shared!

* People who make any kind of choice that I don't agree with are burdening me with their medical costs. 

* Why won't the government just let me be free?

* Kids these days are lazy and useless.

investigation into ironic racism in r/thewalkingdead, 
featuring HEAVY BLOODY SPOILERS FOR THE 
LATEST EPISODE.",BritishHobo,177,75,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/12o87j/why_cant_rthewalkingdead_just_fuck_off_an/,"**YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. MAJOR MAJOR SPOILERS FOR EPISODE 4 OF SEASON 3 OF THE WALKING DEAD. NOT SEEN IT YET? FUCK OFF.**

**SERIOUSLY.**

**HUGE SPOILERS.**

**FUCK OFF.**

So, The Walking Dead. Everyone's favourite average zombie thriller show. If you've ever popped into Reddit's official (NB: not official) Walking Dead subreddit, then you have witnessed hell itself, the place where memes go to be tortured for all eternity.

It's a hive of the same old tedious jokes, ""Lori's a cunt"", ""This guy pulls this face a lot"", ""Lori's a whore"", ""This guy says this phrase a lot"", ""We have a major problem with women"", ""This kid runs away a lot"", ""Lori's a fucking bitch"". But there's one in particular that /r/thewalkingdead are just big big fans of.

See, The Walking Dead could be said to have sort of a problem with race. In that its only prominent black character, the brilliantly named 'T-Dog', is a character who rarely gets any lines. For the first two series, he was basically one step up from a background character. And /r/thewalkingdead made good use of that. They took a stand, and they showed that they were much more racially-concious than the writers of the show, by... *never ever shutting the fuck up about the fact that T-Dog is black*.

What gets me about ironic racism on Reddit is this: if ironic racism, 'jokingly' calling a black person a criminal, 'jokingly' saying that they're less than human, 'jokingly' saying they're an absent father and probably belong in prison, is something you do literally every time the topic turns to black people, or a black person appears on screen, you are not being ironically racist. You are *just a racist*.

So when fan favourite T-Dog died in last night's episode, /r/thewalkingdead came out and treated him with the respect and reverence he bloody well deserves. Let's take a look at the front page, shall we?

[Ha ha, a black guy in a prison, here's an opportunity to make an ironic joke!](http://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/12nq94/spoiler_i_couldnt_resist_bad_luck/)

[""We have a new black guy.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/12nh7w/and_just_like_that_we_have_a_new_black_guy/)

Meanwhile in the main discussion post: [The very fresh observation that black people die in horror movies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/12n2i7/the_walking_dead_episode_discussion_s03e04_killer/c6wihz6) Bonus comments beneath: ""Don't worry. We have a new token black guy"" (what the fuck do these people want? The new character's race has nothing to do with anything, he's had a good role in the first few episodes, and come into his own - yet they still TOTALLY IRONICALLY GUIZE laugh about how he's the 'token black guy'). About seven hundred people all saying 'CAN ONLY BE OEN  BLACK GUY IN TEH GROUP HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!' [Yet another 'don't need no man' joke.](http://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/12n2i7/the_walking_dead_episode_discussion_s03e04_killer/c6wihl9) More [LOL IT'S TOTALLY NOTEWORTHY THAT THE NEW CHARACTER IS BLACK!!!!!!!!!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/12n2i7/the_walking_dead_episode_discussion_s03e04_killer/c6wiywd) horseshit. [Another 'strong black woman don't need no man' joke, because /r/thewalking dead is just *ironically* resorting to stereotypes that are completely unrelated to anything that happened in the group.](http://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/12n2i7/the_walking_dead_episode_discussion_s03e04_killer/c6wisop) A comment about how [AMC are the ones treating black people poorly](http://www.reddit.com/r/thewalkingdead/comments/12n2i7/the_walking_dead_episode_discussion_s03e04_killer/c6wiz5b). And that's where it gets me.

I know what you're thinking. 'It's just a joke, you fucking humourless feminazi twat! It's just a joke about how the *writers* underdeveloped the only black character!' Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's all about how the *writers* and *AMC* treated the black character differently. So why is it that every single time T-Dog does anything, or a black character appears, /r/thewalking dead *has* to force it into a 'LOL IRONIC BLACK PEOPLE JOKE IRONICALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'? Huh? Man, it's almost as if they can't see a black character without immediately resorting to racist jokes they then hide behind a cowardly curtain of irony.

ALMOST.

The writers of The Walking Dead didn't write T-Dog very well. He could be said to be the definition of a token black character. Had very little personality, no real history to speak of, and very few lines. But this episode, he took a moral stand against Rick's bullshit, toughened up, and sacrificed himself to save the others. Meanwhile, one of the newer characters, who just happens to be black (**SHOCK HORROR**), is in a conflict with Rick, eventually ending when he takes the high ground and saves Rick, potentially cementing him a place in the group. Some nicely written storylines, adding a lot to the show, neither of which have *any* relation to race. But thanks to the socially concious humour machines over at the haunted meme factory that is r/thewalkingdead, you can laugh about the fact that the writers utilized two black actors in a perfectly satisfying way without their race being at all relevant, by HAHA BLACK PEOPLE ARE CRIMINALS AND DON'TY NEED NO MAN AND LOL TOKEN BLACK MAN AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

IT'S JUST IRONY, THAT'S WHY WE SAY IT **EVERY SINGLE TIME WE SEE A BLACK PERSON**.

This thread highlights something I noticed a while ago.  Even though practically all the comments on the picture are insulting the OP for being unoriginal, the post still has 1500+ upvotes.  

There used to be a time when comments actually meant something, carried some weight.  If there was a comment that contradicts a dishonest post, the post would massively get down voted.  People used to check the comments to gain perspective on it.  This example is /r/funny, but this idea is so much more important in /r/politics.  I remember years ago when a bias police brutality story was posted, and someone in the comments called them out for it and the post got down voted into oblivion.  Now, if something like that gets posted, and a comment contradicts it, it won't even make a dent in the upvotes.

After reading about it yesterday, I've mulled over how much of a shitstorm it has become.  Perhaps this topic can be filed under Subreddit Drama as there are many bruised egos, but there are also many jerks to be had.  

Gangnam Style was fun in the beginning, but Redditors have had fun [beating a dead horse](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yq0fv/reddits_circlejerk_over_psys_gangnam_style_turns/).  They [flooded r/korea](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/yq0fv/reddits_circlejerk_over_psys_gangnam_style_turns/) with explanations, saying that they truly ""got it"" when everyone else was just having fun and didn't understand, you know, being smug.  Then, this happened:

&gt; [Is Gangnam style intended to be a social critique, or is it just supposed to be fun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oqd/i_am_south_korean_singer_rapper_composer_dancer/c6r5x6m)

Yes, it cannot be both.  Any social critique must lack comedy or fun.  This is why the Daily Show does so poorly in the ratings, and why no one reads Kurt Vonnegut.

&gt; [GS is not a critique, just FUN!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oqd/i_am_south_korean_singer_rapper_composer_dancer/c6r8wm4)

PSY obviously couldn't be a sort of Stephen Colbert, vying for the limelight but poking fun of everyone in the process.  Or he really couldn't just be a pop singer, you know?  I mean, they [really wanted to be validated](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oqd/i_am_south_korean_singer_rapper_composer_dancer/c6r6urg):

&gt; Hi Psy! I'm sure a lot of people here on Reddit have this same question. When I first saw your video I thought it was great. For me, the video was a not-so-subtle jab at the wealthy culture of South Korea. I think this idea resonates well with any culture with a large wealth gap. Over time I've seen your explanation of Gangnam Style devolve from (and I'm paraphrasing) ""a song about the wealthy Gangnam district"" to ""a song about riding a horse"". This left me disappointed.

&gt; The Atlantic published an article and picked up on the social commentary of Gangnam style:

&gt; ""I spoke with two regular observers of Korean culture to find out what I was missing, and it turns out that the video is rich with subtle references that, along with the song itself, suggest a subtext with a surprisingly subversive message about class and wealth in contemporary South Korean society.""

&gt;The article also quotes you as saying:

&gt; ""Human society is so hollow, and even while filming I felt pathetic. Each frame by frame was hollow.""

&gt; I almost feel like this opportunity to expose and popularize the wealth gap was squandered - at least to the international audience. Can you comment on that?

This is barely even a question at all.  But 'OK', you're thinking, maybe he's just messing with us and we're still right about all of this.  Tell me, PSY, if you could work with anyone, who would it be?

&gt; [i love so many but if i had to choose one justin bieber](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oqd/i_am_south_korean_singer_rapper_composer_dancer/c6r8zlh)

Like all good things, reddit has to ruin it for me by turning it into a mindless, content-free circlejerk.

What makes it content-free, you ask? You didn't ask that because it's fucking obvious that it adds nothing at all to the discussion in that thread. But I'll go ahead and break it down for you anyway.

1) There is no joke or humor here. When people post random overused quotes from movies or TV shows or whatever it's normally at least supposed to be funny. This is nothing. It's the words to the fucking song and that's it.

2) If you know the name of this song then *you can look up the words to it in two fucking seconds.* You could substitute literally that entire comment tree for [the number one fucking Google search result for ""flobots handlebars lyrics.""](http://www.lyricsmania.com/handlebars_lyrics_flobots_the.html) There is just no point - NO FUCKING POINT AT ALL - to posting the entire song's lyrics one comment at a time like this.

3) In this particular case I don't even understand how the top comment in this comment tree is relevant to the thread. What the fuck. It's like it doesn't even matter if the comment or reference is meaningful in the context of the thread, all that matters is ""HURR I RECOGNIZE SONG.""

This kind of ""post song lyrics, now everybody else must post the rest of the lyrics"" thing happens on reddit frequently, and without fail it always becomes a contender for the longest comment tree in the thread. Sometimes the lyrics will be changed up a little bit to be a Weird Al-style parody of whatever the thread is about, with the first post being mildly clever at best and each subsequent parody verse/line getting increasingly forced and awkward. I hate that version of the song lyrics jerk too, but at least I can sort of understand why somebody else might find it funny.

But this comment tree? There's nothing to get. There's no joke. There's no interesting or meaningful information conveyed by it. It is ""DAE know this song?"" and that's it. And it's got dozens of fucking comments. This is probably the greatest example of derailing a potentially interesting thread for a pointless circlejerk that I have ever seen.

This is a post that concluded rather sternly with:

&gt;So in closing-

&gt;* WE ARE TIRED OF PC CIRLEJERKING

&gt;* WE ARE TIRED OF SEEING THE SNES YOU FOUND IN MINT CONDITION

&gt;* WE ARE TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT HOW EA SUCKS.

Following that up, the top comment (and attatched thread) continues the trend by asserting that no one cares about HL3 confirmation jokes,  gems, and Portal-themed stuff, Pandemic 2, etc. As someone points out, it's practically an anti-circlejerk circlejerk. ^^sup ^^guys ^^how ^^are ^^you ^^today  The thread overall criticizes the moderation team for the sharp decline and makes some light calls to action but nothing very serious.

Momentary break: For all that many people despise WarPhalange, his comment floating near the bottom of the page does make an incredibly good point:

&gt;Hi. You guys remember me? Remember how I said all of this a while ago and you just got angry at me? Not a damn thing has changed since then.

He made a post a number of months ago [making fake claims that he was recovering from cancer](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/qdmb8/the_same_day_my_doctor_told_me_my_cancer_was/c3wsz9s) to try and demonstrate how much readers would eat any fake story up.  I'm quite confident that this stunt made him the most RES-tagged person on the website.

----

Now, as of yesterday we hit critical mass with a story about [Gabe Newell, CEO of Valve Corporation, allegedly stating that he would rather have Valve disintegrate than be bought by EA](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/znna7/gaben_id_rather_see_valve_disintegrate_than_sell/).  The top comment thread details how much of a hero he is to the video gaming industry, the third from the top claims that Valve would be different if bought by EA (completely true), followed by a comment of ""Yeah, fucking their customers in the ass"" with double the points. This is already one of the finest pinnacles of everything we've come to loathe about this subreddit.  *But it gets better.*

Taking its place as the second post: [Turns out, it was a heavily editorialized bullshit article.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/zoqpa/ea_did_not_offer_1_billion_for_valve_gaben_did/) Who knew.

This thread also features a top comment of calling out the subreddit:

&gt; You can't stop it after the ritual Jerk of Circles has started.

-
&gt; It's hit terminal velocity. There is no hope for survival. Bomb shelters and ""duck and cover"" maneuvers are in place, but will ultimately prove to be useless against such destruction on such an epic and historical scale. There will be no survivors.

(And then for all the meta, the next response was a reference to the ""go on the internet and tell lies"" picture that gets posted seven times in every comment thread, and then the *next* response was actually taking that reference and just reciting the quote word-for-words incase *you just didn't get it*.)

People come together, once again, to complain about the quality of the subreddit and how it reacts to this obvious jerkbait. But do they actually do anything about it?

----

It's not like these are even the only two.  Frequently the top comment threads of posts will directly call out that this is simply jerking, but at the same time people upvote calling out the bullshit they're still upvoting the bullshit because it's still on the front page.  We also see many posts such as ""[/r/gaming: Easy to learn, even easier to master!](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/z8b7b/rgaming_easy_to_learn_even_easier_to_master/)"", which actually shitpost all over its own meta by having the top comment thread hijacked by Sure_Ill_Draw_That, and even though I'll admit I really enjoy many of the things he posts, it's still a problem.

I actually thought by the end of writing this I'd have coherent thoughts together enough to form a direct conclusion in what I wanted to say **but shit if that happened**, but I'll feel bad if I actually do make the big whiny post without trying to be minimally constructive about it, so I'll fry something up.

I understand almost all of these problems come from the lurker vs contributor rate Reddit and the internet in general display.  So how do you combat this through moderation?  I'm going to argue that for a moderation team to be successful, they have to draw a firm line where the direction of the subreddit has to be for the benefit of those members of the community who contribute **and only them.** They can't be dissuaded by the idea that ""if it's the most upvoted, then obviously people like it.""  Analyzations of why the voting algorithm doesn't support this viewpoint alone have appeared on this subreddit.

I understand that the people who view and consume your content are humans and the content is just as important to them as a contributor, but you can't let that dictate what happens to your subreddit because then it turns into images, memes, and easily consumable headlines that can be voted upon and moved on from.

Ever since I saw this thread this morning, I was wondering whether or not I should create a thread about it. One one hand, many of the answers are jokes, but on the other, there are so many responses that display such an ignorance of modern music that I couldn't help it. Personally, I consider /r/Music to be one of the worst defaults out there, but the fact I like music so much means I suffer through the bad stuff for the occasional good post.

Posts like the following, though, just make me wonder where these people have been for the last couple of decades.

&gt;Modern alternative rock??

&gt;If Nickelback, Five Finger Death Punch, Buck Cherry and bands like them just went away, I'd be so happy.

&gt;It's hard for me to describe what I think is so terrible about them. It might be the real hard instrumentals and the hoity toity lyrics with their stupid ass melodies. I just picture 45 year old blondes ""dancing"" to this shit with their ""woo!!!!"" girlfriends in some shitty bar in the country. You know the type: big blonde hair with an entire can of aquanet keeping it perfectly teased wearing tight tapered jeans and a leopard print tank top. Overly tan, freckly bust. Ugh. Worst music ever.

Now, excuse me while I listen to the real ~~cock~~ rock like AC/DC and Bad Company. Why is this kind of music not acceptable now, but perfectly acceptable if it came out a few decades ago? It was just as trite then as it is now. Then you have bands like Pearl Jam who do the exact same thing and yet no one really cares about them.

Then we go to what I think is the worst post in the entire thread.

&gt;As someone who enjoys a lot of music, I have to admit that the music that peaks the charts at present quite frankly disgusts me... Nicki Minaj and the likes of that do not deserve the ridiculous amount of fame they've got.

&gt;This is one of the reasons I think nowadays has the worst era of music, purely because people are getting global recognition for things that are minuscule compared to what some artists are creating and go completely unheard of.

Anyone who has even an ounce of historical music knowledge knows this has always happened since the advent of the record player. What separates people like Nicki Minaj from Elvis or The Monkees? They are all equally manufactured pop acts, yet when you're born in the wrong generation like this redditor, it's impossible to look at the past without rose-tinted glasses. It's honestly one of the few things that pisses me off, when people try to pass off ignorant opinions as if they hold any merit. What kind of music do you have to listen to to not realize that popular music fifty years ago is just as vapid as music today? The fact this got 85 gross upvotes from the same sub who can't seem to let go of the most popular rock bands like Led Zeppelin and Tool is confusingly ironic.

There thankfully are some [voices of](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1fniow/what_era_of_music_is_the_absolute_worst_of_all/cac0lss) [reason](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1fniow/what_era_of_music_is_the_absolute_worst_of_all/cac0mu9) in the thread that shed some light onto the bias of some of the redditors. They more or less make some pretty compelling arguments that I think shed some light onto the bias that many redditors have against modern music.

There are more, but they are thankfully pretty far down in the comments. When I first looked, a lot of comments lambasting modern music were pretty high up. Maybe I'm grasping at straws a little, but being willfully ignorant of music is something that irritates me. I understand completely that taste is subjective, but when you make such large blanket statements over styles that have lots of variety, that defense gets thrown out the window.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_1fp3py,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1fp3py/music_nowadays_is_literally_worse_than_it_ever/,

&gt;Honest question, what's a good tip on pizza? I usually tip $5 on an order that's about $15. Seems like a good tip, but I honestly just don't know.

Fair question, on topic, let's see some of the gems!

&gt;I thought rule of thumb was always $3-5 and never a percentage of what you paid

Well that's odd, but yea I guess a general rule would be for your average order that's the ballpark for a...not terrible tip?

&gt;INCORRECT. Former driver here. If I delivered 140 bucks worth of food to a party or something and got a 5 dollar tip, I was PISSED. Larger orders are more difficult and require you to wait at the restaurant until they are ready (which reduces the amount of orders/tips you get in a day). Don't be a jerk. If you expect someone to deliver your food to your FRONT DOOR, why wouldn't you tip them the same percentage that you'd give a waiter or bartender??

A bit aggressive but good point, that rule of thumb hardly works when you're ordering more than one pizza! I'm sure the fine people of AA will agree, being a bunch of logical STEM majors!

&gt;FUck you. You don't deserve tip based on percentage or any tip at all. A tip is not mandatory. Don't bite the hand that feeds you free money (tips). If you have beef with the amount of work and pay you receive then take it to your employer or find a new job.

Welp

&gt;A tip means that I'm satisfied with my service. They're not mandatory -- they're supposed to encourage you to do your job well.

YOU CAN'T *MAKE* ME TIP YOU, JERK!

&gt;You're the one complaining that someone gave you $5 for free. Be grateful for what you get.

In reaction to being told not to be a jerk.

Well that's just the top rated thread, and there's a decent amount of 'what, no, pay the guy a decent tip you assholes' to balance it, let's see what the second highest thread is!

&gt;I've not once tipped a pizza delivery person, then again I live in the UK and we don't tip for fucking everything!

This is just the perfect embodiment of the ""Electronic Arts is literally Hitler!"" circlejerk that plagues /r/gaming and /r/technology on a constant basis. I don't know, I am not so emotionally invested in video games, so I don't really hate Electronic Arts that much (although I do find them trying to stifle used game sales by making the online component to their games separate from the single-player mode a little underhanded). Anyway, let's take a look at some at some of these wonderful responses as we peer into the minds of your typical /r/technology poster.

&gt;GOOD. Fuckers ruining Maxis and other good game design studios.

Top comment has the jerk phasers set to overkill. A pretty valid complaint, albeit rather poorly worded. If a big publisher ruined a game company that made a franchise I enjoyed a lot, I would be pretty angry as well, but not too sad.

This guy suggests we mourn the death of the poor companies EA has killed over the years.
&gt;Let's have a moment of silence for the others. EA has bought and the subsequently wrecked and destroyed:

&gt;Origin Systems

&gt;Bullfrog Productions

&gt;Maxis

&gt;Pandemic

&gt;BioWare

&gt;Westwood Studios

&gt;PopCap Games

&gt;Phenomic Games

&gt;Mythic

&gt;There's also several others, but the Big Six are up there.

Let's eulogize the poor, poor companies that HitlEAr exterminated like an afterthought. It's like these companies had no choice but to accept EA's money, they were forced to be acquired by them under fear of being killed! It really is tragic what EA did to Bejeweled, trying to introduce new pieces and everything. Let's not forget Spore, the game that could have been, but ended up being DOA. We will always miss you, brave freedom fighters of popular gaming.

This is just the tip of the iceberg, but in the spirit of LEF, I was lazy. The entire thread, and I mean the entire thing, is a Two Minute Hate^TM over EA. It's quite comical. One would wonder if these poor gamers have any idea how business works, and that sometimes, you need to make money as well as make a good game, and a big publisher like EA offering you millions of dollars for your ideas is a very lucrative offer. Let's ignore the fact this happens everywhere and that the big fish eating the smaller fish is common practice. Nope, it's entirely the fault of the stupid corporations ruining our innocent game companies! 

I have a proposition for these people! They should go out, learn how to develop games, and make their own! They can have a hit series like Mass Effect and Spore and when the eventual call from EA or Activision comes in offering them millions for an acquisition, they can twirl their neckbeards, take a deep breath, and tell them to fuck off and hang up the phone.

It was about a WSJ article that had an infographic on how much your taxes would rise if you were a part of the most evil and entitled of all groups, the 1%. 

/r/politics of course only looked at the headline and pontificated that the WSJ claimed that the average income for a single parent is $260k/year.

All of these comments spawn there own separate jerks about Ayn Rand, STEM degrees, and rich entitled white people (rich people don't have *real* problems like us 99%ers do!!!!) but their analysis of the WSJ comment section is really what tickles my fancy. That whole comment thread is an orange name and a [quality post *star*] tag away from looking exactly like a liberally slanted /r/circlebroke post.

If you want to experience some classic /r/politics jerks, there are a plethora to be had in that comment section but this behavior is unlike anything I've seen before. An inherently jerky post with jerky comments about how jerky some other comments are. Where do I fit in in this equation? Unfortunately, I do not have my PhD. in circlejerking as this is my first post but I hope someone with more experience can see the massive lack of self-awareness here.

But after reading just the titles, it became apparent that these folks really do believe that everyone is out to get them because *THEY'RE ATHEISTS* and not because they can't ever shut the fuck up about being Athiests^TM.

So back to the linked thread about our thread. It has all the butthurt one might expect from someone who is wrong, knows they're wrong, and can't accept that they are indeed wrong.

&gt;In classic circlejerker style, they're bashing /r/atheism[5] for not viewing this post with skepticism (because being a skeptic means assuming everyone is trying to trick you all the time), all the while asserting that this has to be someone trolling without investigating the claim in the slightest.

Right, because we just bash /r/atheism for no reason at all. What have these poor, persecuted Atheists^TM ever done to us? Le boo hoo.

&gt;None of the people who have been calling this an obvious fake have any real evidence to offer that this might be the case, none of them appear to have sought evidence, and, in fact, many of them seem to lack a basic understanding of what evidence is or how it works. 

Except for the comment threads pointed out above, which offer great reasons for why this is fake. /u/K_Lobstah even points out his seven years post-secondary education (sup Van Wilder?), but apparently that still means he lacks a basic understanding of evidence and how it works. Uh, okay.

Then, the best part:

&gt;As it happens, it took me all of 15 minutes to determine who was teaching this class and e-mail him requesting confirmation.

&gt;[Yup.](http://i.imgur.com/DkGW5.png)

An email from a no-named professor at a no-named college/university/online college who not only provides an unnecessarily long, drawn-out answer in true /r/atheism form, but makes sure to say something about karma. Perfect reddit professor.

But alas, this is just one topic in /r/AntiAtheismWatch. It goes deeper and gets sadder (funnier? More pathetic?) as you read on.

[Complaining about /r/AdviceAnimals.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/16adfq/im_open_minded_if_you_agree_with_me/] I'm not even sure that one was a jab at /r/atheism or Atheists^TM in general, just TYPICAL LIBERAL WOMEN LOL RIGHT GUISE (don't call SRS pls).

[Again, /r/AdviceAnimals](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1675ar/everyone_is_obsessed_with_either_hating_him_or/c7te6h0). Yes, that guy was totally hating on atheism and not just on a very annoying subset of atheists he encounters online.

[Here we have a post from... /r/AdviceAnimals... again...](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1670p9/atheists/) This subreddit really is a great cross-section of everyone subscribed to /r/atheism not named /u/NukeThePope. As in, 14 years old and FUCK YOU MOM.

(I'm going to stop with the /r/AdviceAnimals links, but rest assured, if you venture to /r/AntiAtheismWatch, they're the majority of the front page).

[A link to the post about the new reddit gold allowing you to block certain subreddits.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/1679go/new_reddit_gold_feature_filter_subreddits_from/) It's like they don't get the hint that people don't hate them for being Atheists^TM, they hate them for not being able to shut the fuck up about it.

A shining example of what /r/atheism has become. This is so obviously fake I can't believe that one person would upvote it, let alone fifteen hundred. (Three thousand?)

I know that /r/atheism is normally a LEF, so I'll try to put some effort into explaining what this means for the community, tying in all of our favourite jerks.

First and foremost, this has nothing to do with atheism. Nothing at all. Not even a quote about how religion sucks or how awesome science is. This is literally a guy posting his 'class assignment', and adds no new discussion.

Second, there's the whole no letterhead, very poor grammar (for a professor), the 'professor' saying ""What I am thinking here"", no rubric for a major assignment. It sounds like the typical STEM trying to imagine what a humanities assignment would sound like in a religion course.

Kudos to OP for getting [someone](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/164q0c/decided_to_take_a_religious_studies_class_this/c7ssn3x) to back him up, I'll admit, especially a three year old account, but it's still probably just two friends trying to troll the subreddit.

Third, this is not the first time this (concept) has been posted. About five times that I've seen in the last year, someone has posted ""My professor made me do a project on /r/atheism!"", and it gets 1500 upvotes and 100 comments talking about how fake it is. (And we're back to the disconnect between voters and commenters.) So far on this one nobody is calling it out at all, which is somewhat worrying. Most of the skeptical comments are saying that this is a bad idea, or that /r/atheism is the wrong place to find atheists, but all are taking this submission at face value.

So, in summation: ridiculous claim of class assignment, all of /r/atheism jerking to death over it, a very poor fake, a STEM guy's idea of humanities, and disconnect between voters and commenters. We've got all we need here for an atheism bestseller.

Mine would be...

* /r/fearme - Sort of like /r/wtf but a little more focus on just the creepy. Comments aren't always the best but the posted links are very good and provide some interesting stuff to look at from time to time if you like morbid kind of things. /r/MorbidReality would be another good contender if you like looking at fucked up things.

* /r/circlemusic is an offshoot I mod but it is sort of a good cross between /r/listentothis and /r/music. Not as circlejerky as /r/music but has some other content thrown in so it isn't always just links to songs. But it is mostly just links to songs a lot of the time, but we're open to any content. So feel free to post it. We're also having our own Best Of 2012 Music Award which are open for a few more days. [So vote for that!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFJmdlVHUzh5NzFJZlpONnBKampSN2c6MQ#gid=0)

* Also /r/mildlyinteresting. It has 100k+ subscribers but in the event you haven't heard of it it is good. It is sort of like /r/pics but with less bullshit attention, look at my dog or cat or how I met Neil Degrassi Tyson, type post.

* I'm adding /r/baseball just because it is a great community. People trash talk but generally it is all in good fun and it can sometimes be hilarious. In season it is great for news and highlights and out of season dumb baseball related stuff gets posted but it is still interesting and not boring.

After the recent averaging out of the anti-Israel furor with the pro-Isreal viewpoint, I imagined we might get some decent discussion on the next Israel / Hamas conflict post that was on the frontpage.

Once again, reddit fails to disappoint:

&gt; [Netanyahu speaking candidly, not realizing cameras are on: ""America won't get in our way, it's easily moved.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/13e9zt/netanyahu_speaking_candidly_not_realizing_cameras/)

At first glance this sounds like something significant, however one bloke rightly [points out](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/13e9zt/netanyahu_speaking_candidly_not_realizing_cameras/c736x9h) that the video is from 2001, during an escalation of the conflict known as the '[second infitada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada)' an hour after it was posted. He's currently on **63 points 5 hours ago**.

I'm sure you've all guessed where this is going - a blatant rush to post any criticism of Israel to accrue the most spoils. First comment:

&gt; [Israel is not our friend and never was our friend.

Residing at **1683 points 6 hours ago** (That's an upvote every ~13s) the tone is set with an anti-Israeli opinion straight off and a bit of subtle finger pointing to the amerikans. I think this is what kicked off the entire thing. It's the perfect storm and I can only imagine how smug the bloke must be now that he's been upvoted so much.

The next reply was inevitable given the open ended initial comment

Sometimes you've gotta gamble to get the comments in early - in the few seconds spellcheck would've taken someone else could've stolen the unique viewpoint that you can't criticise the Jews, and be rolling in karma at the moment.

This guy was too late for commenting how amerika is subverting criticism, so the next goldmine is how the Jews themselves are.

The rest of the thread is filled with upvoted comments such as claiming Hasbara shills are in the thread, tips of argument tangents when arguing with republicans - basically all agreeing with the massively upvoted thread - an absolute gangfuck of comments.

I don't normally touch on the DAE FUNDIE? stuff as it's that ridiculous it makes me laugh, however I had to mention this as the sheer smugness is amazing. In response to the original 'Israel isn't our friend' comment:

&gt; While I totally agree with you, I would just like to point out why many Americans may side with Israel.

'I've figured it out lads!

&gt; I grew up in an extremely conservative + fundamental Christian household. To me, everyone was either ""for"" us (believed in God), or ""against"" us (didn't believe in God). I supported Israel solely because they bore some relation to Christianity, and nothing else. I know many Christians who would feel the same way. They don't care about politics, they don't care about what they do, all they care about is their religion.

no words. 

&gt; I am fervently anti-religion now, and only now can I see how brainwashed I was. Now I can see the truth of the matter regarding the Palestine - Israel conflict, but back when I was religious, none of that mattered... Shit pisses me off...

Now I see the light now. I've fully concluded every single part of the Isreali-Arab conflict - all by unbrainwashing myself from my repressive shackles of a religious family.

&gt; I also remember going to church, and praying PResident Bush would win, because he was a Christian. And when he won, everyone at Church celebrated because ""God heard our prayers"". Even more ridiculous, when the Passion of the Christ came out, we prayed it would be successful, and when it did, we celebrated again. Looking back I realized how stupid it is, but at the time, my mindset was completely different (along with everyone else's) and nothing you could say would change my mind. 

Reddit's default view of Christianity.

&gt; Religion is a scary thing. It has the potential to brainwash you to the extremes, and can easily control you and your actions. And the worst thing of all, while you are in that mindset, you see yourself as the hero, one of the Savior's faithful doing His work for Him.

&gt; Fucking crazy...

I wonder if anyone on reddit will agree with him?

Is there anybody on Reddit (or almost anywhere, really) that doesn't support this?

&gt; I think there is too much spent on keeping people alive when there is no hope. Mostly I think this applies to old people (but I can see some younger cases also), it is going to cost $250,000 to keep granny alive and bed bound for another couple of days. Well granny had a good life, it is time to say goodbye to granny.

I've never heard *that* one before, especially not on Reddit.

&gt; I never want kids.
People tell me it is unnatural for a woman to feel that way. And people tend to smile patronizingly and tell me I will change my mind.

May I direct you over to /r/childfree?

&gt; I think euthanasia should be legal. When people get really old, or get certain diseases, living is just a pain-filled hell. Like, people with dementia, who are so out of it that they can't hold a conversation and aren't aware of their surroundings. People with painful terminal illnesses. Elderly folk who are quickly losing their health, where it hurts to walk around or maybe they're facing expensive and painful medical procedures to prolong life.
Just let them end it with dignity.
I also think fetuses with disorders should be aborted if it is detected. Down syndrome, retardation, physical deformities, etc. Try again for a healthy child--don't intentionally bring into the world something that will live in pain, or be unable to live independently.

Again, I've totally never read this on Reddit before.

&gt; I'm extremely uncomfortable around mentally handicapped people.

So are a lot of people!

However, there are a few acceptable ones, ones you don't see very often (if at all).

&gt; I think Pandas are an evolutionary disaster. Seriously, pandas are so backwards. They feed off of bamboo (which has little to no nutritional value), and the sheer amount of bamboo they HAVE to eat to survive is ridiculous. By now, they should have just evolved to eating more things, so that they could continue their line.
Calling it right now, within the next 50 years, pandas will be completely extinct.

I'm sure it's been on Reddit before, but at least it's not quite as common as the rest of the aforementioned circlejerky responses.

&gt; Im pro suicide and im not talking about for just the terminally ill.

I would definitely argue that this goes against the Reddit norm, seeing as how most suicide-type posts come with people begging suicidal people to get therapy/professional help.

At first I thought, ""Wow that's an incredibly ignorant thing for the FBI to say."" So I clicked on the Gizmodo link and noticed how short it was and the lack of information so I clicked on the source article from the [NZ Herald.](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10826176) It turns out there was no official FBI statement on it. The ""doomsday device"" quote was from Dotcom's lawyer, most likely trying to trivialize the evidence, and the ""wipe out evidence of internet piracy around the world"" quote was the words of the author of the article, not of anyone in particular. The only thing quoted from any official is from the New Zealand Detective inspector who oversaw the operation saying that the FBI told him Kim Dotcom may have, ""carried a device with him to delete servers around the world"", which is a lot less outlandish than what the title of the post implies and a lot less unbiased. As such there was no official comment from the FBI. Of course Dotcom ended up having no such device making the FBI look foolish but it's not as ridiculous as the title implying he had a device that could wipe out all evidence of internet piracy. So I went into the comments section and saw most people [making fun of the Doomsday quote that no one besides Dotcom's lawyer actually said.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/y1szk/the_fbi_justified_the_insane_raid_of_kim_dotcoms/c5rk145)

   [And the other comments were filled with how Kim Dotcom is an innocent man who just ran Megauplaod and was blissfully unaware of all the piracy on the site](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/y1szk/the fbi_justified_the_insane_raid_of_kim_dotcoms/c5rjqj5), when if they took ten seconds to look up the indictment papers they would see that the FBI has evidence such as emails between people at Megaupload that showed they willingly paid users to upload pirated material among other things. And then there were the comments of course hailing piracy as something that is not wrong and should be legal. It is legitimate to question whether the size and scale of the raid of Kim Dotcom's home was needed but that's not my concern. So my question is, why do redditors hail Kim Dotcom as some kind of hero? He was an inside trader, embezzler, and participated willingly in mass piracy making huge amounts of money because of it. Obviously, I don't know him personally but someone who [owns multiple expensive cars with the license plates ""God"", ""Guilty"", ""Stoned"", ""Mafia"" and ""Hacker""](http://www.vice.com/read/we-read-the-megaupload-indictment-papers-so-you-don-t-have-to-1) comes across as a huge douchebag. Do they not realize the hypocrisy that they attack people like Romney, who I have no intention of voting for btw, for being a successful businessman but defend Dotcom who is a known crook. Also, why do they feel the need to defend piracy so much? I watch some TV shows online from time to time and download some movies but I don't try to defend it as hard as some of these people. And why do redditors seemingly never read the source article or look beyond the title. Sorry if they're any grammatical errors or if this is not a good topic for circlebroke.

It isn't exactly a secret that women are often treated like shit on the internet, especially on Reddit. If ever a girl posts a picture with themselves in it and they are even moderately attractive, the thread gets filled with cries of ""No Gonewild, was disappoint"" and ""Gonewild request, OP!"". Sometimes, a girl doesn't even need to [post any pictures](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/x956t/some_kid_put_these_in_the_tip_jar_where_i_work/c5kaqgo).

You also find plenty of instances of ""if he were attractive this wouldn't be creepy!""

I feel that before I start, I have been studying Russian for a number of years and met many Russian people, so of course this particular jerk annoyed me more than most because of my natural predispositions.

To start, the debate about the semantics of the term 'Russia's Independence Day' is pretty much moot, because in Russian, it is called 'День России, Den' Rossii', which literally means 'Day of Russia', or 'Russia's Day'. I'm not entirely aware why it has been commonly been translated into English as 'Russia's Independence Day', but at any rate it can be seen as a  celebration of Russia's 'liberation' from Soviet doctrines and it's reemergence as the Russian Federation. 

Of course, this doesn't stop redditors with the same oh so funny and pertinent points being repeated over and over again:

&gt;What are you independent from?

Uh, well, all other countries. In the sense that they have their own government (for better and for worse) that makes their own laws and regulations, perhaps?

&gt;""Independence"" day

And a redditor with two deft strokes of a quotation mark completely tore through the sham of Russian independence. Sitting there smugly, he sat back and waited for the upvotes to roll in before slightly adjusting his Politics Major diploma on his basement wall.

&gt;You mean oxymoron day in Russia yesterday?

Someone quite clearly needs to brush up on words he doesn't fully understand. Just because a word has an 'x' in it doesn't mean it's appropriate for the situation at hand.

So of course, redditors like to think they're better than poor, Freedom™ deprived Russians while they sit in their fortresses of eternal liberty.

Of course, because there has been a lot of controversy in the news recently about Russia's recent ostensible anti-homosexuality laws (which I feel I shouldn't have to add that I am resolutely against), this one pretty picture will inevitable be dogged down with irrelevant insults against the country and its citizens. Regardless of whether you think these kind of comments are warranted, this is certainly not the time or place to make them.

&gt;Hah not if you are gay!

This makes no sense. While gay people in Russia may certainly be *oppressed*, this is nothing to do with their own, personal independence. Just an easy way to rack up the karma.

&gt;That's a pretty gay looking sky... i mean a sky that looks like something that doesn't exist.... -_-

Well that's a massive sweeping general statement about what 'gay' looks like and what 'gay' is. Weather phenomena are gay now? Shit, I guess it's red sky at night, gay man's delight now. The fact he got reddit gold for this is amazing too. This comment impressed someone so much they felt the compulsion to hand out $4 or so to this guy. It boggles the mind.

All in all the majority of the posts are redditors getting anal about the definition of 'independence' and petty remarks about issues in Russia that have nothing to do with this post. There were a few flat-out insulting posts against the whole of Russia that were for the most part downvoted, but the fact that this post even got positive upvotes (at least at time of writing) angers me.

&gt;I think I speak for everyone when I say ""fuck off, Russia, you're on our shit list right now"".

The OP was trying to make a post about a cool photo that coincided with his national day. Of course, redditors have to go and shit on his parade about what's wrong with his country and his people and how enlightened they are by comparison. They don't even know his views on any of the issues they are pressing him about, they just automatically take the side of opposition. I feel one poster summed it up succinctly: 

&gt;Man, this must suck for OP. He shared a cool picture he took on a day that is important to him, and everybody is just shitting on his country.

Redditors seem to think if your country does one thing that goes against the hivemind's point of view then your entire country and by extension your people are pieces of shit. Frankly, it's disgusting.

Edit: In fact, according to Wikipedia, the whole official title of the day is 'День принятия Декларации о государственном суверенитете Российской Федерации
Day of adoption of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Federation', so that really clarifies matters even more.

&gt;number 9 is great if you wanna get shot by the police. in America of course.

Later on, someone asks about what the marketing department was thinking, and this guy reponds:  

&gt;most likely that bad is intended for a non-american market, I doubt you'd get shot for carrying a bag like that in a European country.

""DAE EUROPE&gt;AMERIKKA?""

Another great response  
&gt;Well, if his reality is based in the land of common sense, people should not be so damn dumb.
Sadly this reality is not quite like that and you're most likely going to be shot by police.
LAPD once shot a guy 52 times on his front porch for eating a sandwich. Another guy once got shot because he was holding underwear and they thought it was a gun.
I think it's best not to carry anything in your hands, or even go outside for that matter.

Facebook, is, according to a New Zealand-based news site, dying. Now, I don't think this is inherently a wrong sentiment (certainly the site isn't growing in numbers as much as it used to be) but in case you haven't noticed, reddit kind of hates facebook.

AmeriKKKa is suddenly the land of the free, but now that freedom is under threat -- because Obama is coming to take away your guns. [Suddenly everyone's a constitutional scholar!](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/169bra/biden_obama_considering_executive_order_to_deal/) 

Except the news story is question is from a very conservative source, and all that it says is that Joe Biden thinks that Obama might be thinking about maybe using an executive order to do something relating to gun violence. That doesn't really matter though, so let's get the hyperbole and hysteria brewing! I won't say a word about my personal politics; I'm just here to record some of the jerkiest jerking I've seen in a long while. Keep in mind that I have chosen comments that, at my time of viewing, had at least 25 upvotes -- these aren't just pulled from the detritus at the bottom.

This was the line that made me realise what a perfect jerk stew we had going: 

&gt; Unless you support totalitarianism, I can't imagine this being defensible.

THERE'S YOUR CHOICE AMERICA: Nazi Germany or allowing Obama to consider thinking about an executive order that might limit gun violence. 

In a very similar vein: 

&gt; This action would put this country on the fast track to a future dictatorship. Without the 2nd amendment, none of the others matter. The constitution is there to protect citizens from government. Its entire purpose is to LIMIT the power of the government.

I won't lie; I love the idea that Nick Clegg is second in command in a dictatorship where the people can't legally take up arms against the government. 

And of course, the Soviet Russia model, neighbours turning in their neighbours...: 

&gt; The govt will start with banning the sale of assault weapons, then they will request that everyone turn in those that they currently own. Then the media will tell people to ""assist"" their neighbors turn in their guns, which will undoubtedly result in a which hunt.
Once the assault weapons are gone, they will move on to handguns. The cycle will repeat until only the government has weapons. The govt is not going to ""round up"" or ""seize"" any weapons, but they will use the media to create social pressure to reach their desired end.
Note: I currently own zero guns.

Now they've convinced themselves that Obama will literally rip their guns from the hands of their law-abiding, deer-rack loving children. Civil war will be the result: 

&gt; Whether you agree or disagree with the 2nd amendment, it's frightening that the Vice President even mentions this type of action. This is an extremely scary road we're going down. People thinking this will make us safer: consider what will happen when someone gets in office you don't like, making decisions you don't agree with, using nothing but an executive order, even sidestepping congress. BTW, this is nothing short of something that is at at the very least going to see thousands dead and hundreds of thousands more herded into private prisons. Most of these will be people that simply would not give up their firearm they legally purchased and use for protection or hunting. Most of these will be people who would never commit a serious crime.

And of course guns are necessary because without them the government is not afraid of the people -- the same government that has the largest military in the world, that possesses ATOMIC BOMBS, that has tanks and drones and god knows what else -- and that is why we the people must keep our stock of assault rifles. For shooting down the drones. Or something: 

&gt; First, I'd like to say, I am NOT a gun owner.. But I am terrified of those that protest against gun ownership. The founding fathers of this country thought of the second amendment as a right that provided the citizens with the power to defend themselves from any exterior threats (most importantly the government.. especially since they just stole their independence from another government, the British). If we, the people, let our government take our only right, our only true power to defend ourselves from the government away from us... what do we have left? The famous quote from Thomas Jefferson says it all, ""When the people fear their government, there is tyranny; when the government fears the people, there is liberty."" I literally do not know how to interpret that any more simply. If we let the government take away our only power to keep them in check... I guarantee you that the rest of your freedoms will mean less than nothing to a government that can easily control you. Don't get me wrong, I have never felt anguish and hate towards gun violence as bad as I did against the Sandy Hook incident. I have three brothers that are in elementary school now and I couldn't bear to lose them. However, there is absolutely no way I could ever justify condemning the nation's liberty in order to save just one, or all three of their lives. Saving one life in order to destroy a nation's liberty?? Biden.. you're dreaming. EDIT: TL:DR: Are you really going to trust the government? Even after Obama is out, the law will still stand..

This one is along the same lines, but more poetic: 

&gt; ""The beauty of the Second Amendment is that it will not be needed until they try to take it.""

Similar stuff, all highly upvoted: 

&gt; So what happens when that .5% of gun owners decide to not let the government take their guns? We have 250,000 people rebelling against the government. Smart move Obama.

Some commenters get a little Tolkeinesque when talking about the potential civil war that they see breaking out over this:

&gt; That way lies civil war, most likely.... Either way the divisions in the nation would become permanent and deeper than ever before.

Other commenters lean more towards George R R Martinesque (kingdom? peasants? what?): 

&gt; To be fair with all the other shit going down in the country the likelihood of more people getting frustrated or desperate enough to get a bit shooty increases. If I was in a position of power and saw my kingdom going to shit I'd want the peasants to have as little access as possible to weapons, too.

DAE Americans are too fat and complacent?

&gt; The only question is how many if will take up arms for the cause if any? I have a feeling that today's complacent society will merely ""hide"" their guns rather than fight back. Much of America is too fat and happy to actually risk their lives standing up for their or anybody else's rights.

The constitutional scholars are all over this one (there are many, many comments like this):

&gt; I think that would lead to instant impeachment proceedings.

And this:

&gt; Talk about shitting alllll over the constitution!

Wow, wow, such upvotes for that le gem.

&gt; How the fuck does he get away with this blatant disregard of our checks and balances? He's going to do whatever the hell he wants yet again, and anyone questioning him is automatically going to be labeled a right-wing kook

I haven't highlighted too many comments of this nature, but there's quite a few like it: 

&gt; Seizing arms from citizens is the final step to dictatorship. Regardless of where you sit politically it is important to recognize the danger with this. All of these shootings are tragic, but unfortunately banning guns for law abiding Americans will not prevent these acts.

Yes, law abiding Americans are the ones who should have guns -- because the ones perpetrating these mass shootings are all prior criminals, right? 

And finally, politicians need to live in constant fear of violence, you stupid liberals:

&gt; If Bush discussed reforming the 1st, 4th or 5th amendment you fuckers would already be on the streets with Molotov cocktails. Politicians have to be constantly reminded that they are permitted to live by the public and that privilege can be revoked at any time.

As I said above, I don't think it matters which side of the gun rights debate you fall upon -- these people are freaking the fuck out, feeding on each others' fear, and in general stepping so wildly away from the original news story that their comments read like parody.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_16c24k,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/16c24k/rpolitics_whips_itself_into_a_series_of/,

Semi-low-effort, because fuck linking to individual comments.  

A little backstory: 4G LTE is a standard for wireless data communication at high speeds. I'm sure many of you have at least heard of it. Verizon Wireless in the U.S. is notorious for advertising the living hell out of it. HSPA+ is another 4G technology (some say it isn't yeah but that's another debate) that competes with LTE.  

When 4G LTE devices first started becoming available in the U.S. and elsewhere, /r/Android absolutely loved it.  

[LTE is amazing.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/xg2c7/lte_is_amazing/)  

[It was then that I decided how much better LTE was.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/qi8gs/it_was_then_that_i_decided_how_much_better_lte_was/)  

[So AT&amp;T LTE is insanely fast.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/n4tzm/so_att_lte_is_insanely_fast/)  

[I knew LTE was fast but... this is insane.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/nivum/i_knew_lte_was_fast_but_this_is_insane/)  

And a bonus: [PSA: AT&amp;T is going to screw customers with Fake 4G (HSPA+) now, and will switch to Real 4G (LTE) in 6 months.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/eyct5/psa_att_is_going_to_screw_customers_with_fake_4g/)  

You'll see later why I found this one particularly hilarious.  

-------------------------------------------------------  

So the general consensus was that LTE is insanely fast, and is a major feature of Android devices. People even mocked the iPhone for its lack of LTE for quite a while as well.  

BUT, around a month ago, Google and LG announced the Nexus 4, the newest flagship Android device. It was generally praised around the board by tech reviewers, except in one area that it was harshly criticized for: **lack of 4G LTE.**  

Well, shit, you might say. /r/Android definitely can't get behind it now that it lacks their beloved LTE, can they? NOPE. Nexus/Google fanboyism &gt;&gt;&gt; MUH DATA SPEEDS.  

[What is the LTE controversy?] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12m342/what_is_the_lte_controversy/)  

[T-Mobile's HSPA+ is 42Mbps down. I fail to see why so many people say the Nexus 4's lack of LTE is a dealbreaker when it seems like it's pretty much the same thing. HSPA+ even bested LTE in 11 cities across the country.] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12dr9f/tmobiles_hspa_is_42mbps_down_i_fail_to_see_why_so/)  

[Nexus 4 Review - with much less emphasis on the lack of LTE - by CNET UK division] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12mnf2/nexus_4_review_with_much_less_emphasis_on_the/)  

So the above three links basically backtrack over the entire idea that LTE is so awesome guys, who needs HSPA anymore? Why are they doing this? Well like I said, the lack of LTE was a harsh criticism by many tech blogs (if you look at the title of the third link I posted, **with much less emphasis on the lack of LTE** you can see how mad they got over it.)  

Nexus 4 doesn't have LTE, but it's okay guys it's a Nexus device made by Google so everything will be just fine.  

-----------------------------------------------

Wait one damn second.... what the hell is going on today then?  

[This video shows the Nexus 4 working on a LTE Network, what's going on here?] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/13nr12/this_video_shows_the_nexus_4_working_on_a_lte/)  

[Nexus 4 shown working with LTE after simple tweak | The Verge] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/13nt0l/nexus_4_shown_working_with_lte_after_simple_tweak/)  

(If you are wondering how the hell this happened, the Nexus 4 shares the same internal components as the Optimus G, its sister device that it was based on. The LTE chip seems to have been left in and can be used by changing the APN settings on your phone.)  

/r/Android has just backtracked TWICE on itself. Now that the Nexus 4 has working LTE, all of a sudden they are jizzing themselves over the possibility of getting that sweet LTE action on their phone.  

In hindsight I don't even know if this can be considered low-effort, but this complete 180 degree turn-around by /r/Android today was just too funny/rage-inducing not to share.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/11agpd/til_that_mother_teresa_did_not_administer/c6kqe6v) is a nice little comment from a /r/atheism poster that proves that being non-tolerant and judgmental doesn't mean you have to be any kind of theist.

&gt;Mother Theresa was not a fucking nice person. Judgemental and forced her beliefs on others and discriminated against those who didn't share them. +523

Then there is the other comment I linked earlier:

&gt;She wasn't a fan of helping people who were suffering. She was a fan of suffering. She's idolized instead of vilified... although she did dedicate her life to ""helping"" people, and she did do some good...
I'm conflicted but leaning more towards ""villain."" +228

Well duh she loved to watch people suffer! That's why her favorite medical tool where leather straps, fuzzy cuffs, and cats-o-nine-tails! Seriously! I know because I read it on reddit! 

How stupid do you have to be to criticize her? Clearly these neck beards have done so much more to help the informed and poor to be able to judge her from such 
a fucking moral highpoint.

It appears to be from a number of unsupported allegations by one Sanal Edamaruku, President of the ""Indian Rationalist Society"".

 * Redditors can decide for everybody

I knew it was my duty as a muppet fanatic to preserve my childhood by grouchily complaining on circlebroke.

The trailer is pretty standard. Looks like how a movie trailer for the muppets would look. Barely over a minute long, but uh oh, one of the characters sings Maroon 5!

&gt;Yeah I was onboard until the Moves Like Jager thing...this isn't a Smurfs movie, why are they covering crappy pop songs?

Umm, they've always done that. And so now you're off board? Because Scooter will sing 20 seconds of a song in the movie?

&gt;That killed it for me. I'm sure I'll enjoy it but that left a bad taste in my mouth. Also I don't get some people. They'll shit on the Smurfs, Planes, or whatever for making generic pop culture references. But then when you see it in the Muppets trailer it's time to defend it. ""Oh well it must be out of context and they're making fun of it. Shut up. You're lame. La la la la la I can't hear your criticism la la la la la!""

There's a reason people say you need context - because context is important in like 99% of situations, and especially in movie trailers. It's not an action movie, they can't show you a series of explosions, so they show you a pop culture reference. Like I said, 20 seconds of one song and it killed it for you? Sorry for your loss.

&gt;Scooter doing Maroon 5? Uhhhh, no. Sam the Eagle singing it would have been funnier, particularly if Oz were puppeteering it.

""So one awkward puppet who cant sing doing the song is bad, but if they got another awkward puppet who can't sing, uhhhhh, then it'd be good.""

&gt;jeez, all this does is remind me of the uninspired straight to DVD muppet movies in recent years.

Literally nothing about this sentence is true.

&gt;It screamed soulless cash-in for me

Yep, it has no soul. You can tell from the trailer. 

&gt;sigh All the voices are still very wrong. That's not how Kermit, Animal, or the trailer-voiceover guy are supposed to sound Scooter is somewhat close, but still sad - the poor man's Jimmy Kimmel.

Of course the voices are off, it's almost 40 years after the original. Also, not sure what Jimmy Kimmel has to do with this...

&gt;This seems like it'll be a cash in =/ Seems like they are giving up on sight gags / subtle humor and just going for cheap laughs and pop easy pop reference ... sad :( Also, not a fan of ""Walter"" at all still ... I kind of wish they would just do another Muppet Treasure Island / Christmas Carol thing ... take an old story, retell it with Muppets/People mixed and add some gags.

How could they even put ""subtle humor"" in the trailer? It's only a minute long. You have no idea what the humor in the movie is going to be like.  

Everyone keeps saying ""cash-in"", as if every movie ever wasnt about making money. The last movie was great (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and I'm sure this new one will be good too, but don't let me ruin anyone's nostalgia jerk movie snobbery.

I'd speculate as to why the post was deleted, but this question is answered for us.

&gt;Why the hell was it deleted???

So goes the Samuel L Jackson /r/gonewild post.

So then we have [this](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1f9x5y/im_samuel_l_jackson_and_ill_record_a_video_of_me/ca89nbl) monologue. Again, not quoting it for the sake of space. And again, the replies are the real meat here.

(4741|3043) God forbid Samuel L Jackson say anything that isn't about killing people and shit. Remember that movie he was in called The Incredibles, that kid's movie where he doesn't do anything badass but instead is there for comic relief? Remember how that character became universally hated and was [*not at all* charming or effective](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2qRDMHbXaM)? 

This is the problem with a post like this. Topical humor and Family Guy-esque pop culture references are like gold on Reddit. So you give redditors free reign over what Samuel L Jackson reads and they either paste some shit from elsewhere, write some ""fuck""-laden tripe, or complain because whatever's getting a lot of upvotes isn't something that seems to be written specifically for their narrow view of what Samuel L Jackson should be doing.

Also the edits hint at something far worse. So let's get on to the real shit in this turd sandwich.

&gt;[The fact that Reddit is ruining this opportunity with some cheesy ""don't be lazy"" speech really proves the stereotype that you're all neckbearded fools masturbating into cumboxes in your mothers' basements.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1f9x5y/im_samuel_l_jackson_and_ill_record_a_video_of_me/ca8cl9k?context=1)

The ""opportunity"" he's talking about is the opportunity to have Samuel L Jackson read the Navy Seal copypasta as part of a charity drive for Alzheimer's. This reply is at **(5555|4039)**. The irony of his comment is un-fucking-bearable and apparently nobody else is capable of appreciating it.

At (2984|1929) below this are three simple words.

&gt;Agreed. Fucking pathetic.

A worthwhile comment from someone who truly would know better what to write for Samuel L Jackson.

One exemplar of wisdom has this to say:

&gt;[To all you dumbasses posting stupid cheesy stuff, poems, and movie references:
The point of this is to get him to read something that he normally wouldn't read. It's not really that big of a deal to get him to read some poem or movie line, but it is a challenge to get him to read some lame copypasta. I bet if I was in a room with SLJ and asked him to read a poem for me, he would. But if I asked him to read out the Navy Seal copypasta he probably wouldn't.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1f9x5y/im_samuel_l_jackson_and_ill_record_a_video_of_me/ca8g03e)

Yeah, I'm sure it's a ""challenge."" In the same way as it's a challenge to get Obama to say he fucked your mom on Xbox Live. But this reply outlines Reddit's mindset on this event. Fuck getting Samuel L Jackson to read something worthwhile. Rather, we should focus on getting him to say something *weird* and *edgy*.

I'm going to choke, again. Like extra-hard.

The guy who posted the Alarm Clock monologue, to whom I will not link directly, but you can find him easily enough, has been brigaded all over the place because of the fact that redditors would rather have SLJ read *the fucking Navy Seal copypasta* than a motivational speech that might actually be practical and interesting for some people. I mean sure, it's cheesy as fuck, but this guy got *death threats* over this shit.

Going through his profile, even shit that isn't marginally related to the alarm clock submission has been downvoted to oblivion. Turns out the people donating to the Alzheimer's Foundation are a bunch of insolent, whiny children who can't handle not having their way.

Which is borne out in the comments. These next few are all at least 2k upvotes with over 1k points overall:

&gt;Ugh, motivational speech. Gross.

&gt;This is so embarrassing it actually made me cringe. Please don't make SLJ read something so terrible. Please.

&gt;this would be a lame part of internet history. The navy seal pasta would be something epic.

Truly epic. So epic I'm on the *edge* of my seat. It sets my heart a-flutter to picture SLJ reading the Navy Seal shit. And by that I mean I'm going to have a goddamn coronary.

I thought the cancer was bullshit like forced memes, which is exactly what the Navy Seal thing is, is it not? Ah well, far be it from Reddit to be self-aware.

Yet alarm clock is still winning, which is causing a shitstorm.

You know what's better than a motivational speech? Samuel L Jackson talking about how he jerks off into a cardboard box. I'd love to hear that. I mean I'd *vomit* at the motivational crap, but cumbox? Well, knit me a sweater and call me a granny, that's just fantastic.

Why? I really don't get it, is he so rigid an actor that he cannot adequately read even ONE thing that isn't in his typical typecasting? How is this not an insult to Samuel L Jackson? Actually nevermind, it's just Reddit wanting someone to curse profusely and talk about things that are badass, n' whatnot.

Reddit is OK with death threats and doxxing, as long as it's for the greater good. The greater good, of course, being making sure that Samuel L Jackson never gives a motivational speech. I feel like this is the premise to a South Park episode, but without the self-awareness.

All comments there that so much as ask why the copypasta is so much better than a speech with actual effort put in have been downvoted into the negatives. I'm not going to go through the tedium of linking them all, but as of this writing, not a one is positive. So much as questioning 4chan's decision to upvote a forced meme is tantamount to high treason.

I'm still rooting for the GPS thing. One of the comments suggested SLJ release an app for devices that use GPS and charge money, so the proceeds can go to Alzheimer's research. Seriously, I really want that to happen.

The moral: forced memes are awesome, anything that sounds like it might have come from a grown-up is bullshit, 4chan is God, maybe SOPA wasn't such a bad idea, and 4chan and Reddit cannot tell the difference between each other's circlejerk.

I was browsing Reddit when I came across [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/15ukaf/all_the_time_the_same_thing/) thread. Although there were a few positive comments, the majority reflected the popular jerk that all ""teenagers are horrible"". 

As a preface, I am a 21 year old. I have been out of school for roughly 3 years and have a job with a moderate salary.

And you know what? I still think that the teenage years are rough. For all the disadvantages that ""adult life"" has (bills, job, having to take care of yourself) it has just as many advantages: I can choose how to spend my free time, I can wear what I want, and I can socialize with whoever I want. Teenagers have no such luxury; they have to follow the rules at school and at home. They are subjected to arbitrary authority pretty much all day. 

So what is the general response of redditors when a teenager questions an arbitrary rule imposed upon them? 

[Apparently he's an ungrateful shit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/15ukaf/all_the_time_the_same_thing/c7q2zjp) or a [snot nosed punk](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/15ukaf/all_the_time_the_same_thing/c7q4gnd)

After all, he should [just shut up because she's an adult](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/15ukaf/all_the_time_the_same_thing/c7q47gv). 

I am not saying that this is an important issue; in the end, it's just a trivial school rule. However, it's irritating to me how many of these people seem unable to relate/empathize with teenagers. It's interesting how these people always seem to side with the group they are currently a part of. 

[For example, look at this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/15ukaf/all_the_time_the_same_thing/c7q3iyb) It's so disgustingly dismissive. The implicit message is that ""teenagers don't have real problems, *I* have real problems because I am older"". Yet as a teenager, those problems seemed like real problems. 30 year old problems seem like ""real"" problems when you're 30. A 70 year old might look at a 30 year old and say ""He has no problems. He has everything: a great job, youth, and a great girlfriend. What does he have to complain about?"" Yet from the perspective of the 30 year old, he has ""real"" problems: he has bills, his job is stressful, and he's concerned about his relationship. 

It's all relative. Yet because its ""cool"" to be dismissive towards teenagers on Reddit, the jerk goes on. 

Reddit loves the mantra ""question everything""... unless you are a teenager; then you are an ungrateful brat.

He's greeted by applause from the audience. Cool. Good on him. Feel good moment.

Hey, lets look at the comments. I'm sure that will be insightful.

&gt;[Using 'gay' to mean 'awful' is kind of homophobic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/13q603/german_lecturer_stops_a_flash_mob_developing_in/c76692q)

That comment is at **negative 98 points**. What the fuck. At this point I begin to wonder if this is the work of some sort of internet raid shenanigans. ""Lets downvote the serious criticisms and see if anyone gets mad."" I still am suspicious of this. Maybe I fell for it.

This backwards logic comment makes too little sense to even have been written facetiously though:

&gt;[Maybe our definitions of homophobic differ, but isn't using ""gay"" to describe a person when his/her sexuality is not relevant at the topic at hand homophobic?](http://www.reddit.com/r/JusticePorn/comments/13q603/german_lecturer_stops_a_flash_mob_developing_in/c766b6g)

Fucking *what*?? No, using a word people use to *identify themselves with* as a negative qualifier is indeed hateful towards those people.

This is like if someone called another person a nigger, but when they get called out on it, they argue ""well, you're the one who noticed they're black, so aren't you being racist here?""

SuicideAfterFivePuns basically makes this argument, if not a little less extreme than I did.

This comment has 18 points, which is at least a little comforting.

But here's the piece de resistance. Are you ready for this?

Someone brings home the point that, yes, using the word 'gay' as a synonym for 'awful' is homophobic (at *-25* points I might add). This is someone's response.

I continued reading the comment:

&gt;What I'm saying is that if even these people don't have anything nice to say about gypsies, that's really saying something.
And I don't think blanket ""everyone is equal"" knee-jerk reactions apply here, because at the end of the day cultures are not equal, and there's clearly a very diseased culture at the center of the issue here.

While most people involved in this jerk may adamantly deny that they are pro-eugenics, this indicates a misunderstanding of what eugenics is. Eugenics does not simply consist of forced sterilization/genocide- it also includes promoting the breeding of those with desirable traits/limiting who can have children and how many they can have, etc. The topic of eugenics is touched upon particularly often in AskReddit, and if you do a search for 'eugenics', you will find that most posts have a fairly equal amount of up- and down-votes. However, a search for 'selective breeding' or 'population control' will return mainly-upvoted posts. Way to fall for snake-language, Reddit.

Take a guess as to what the main factors for population control are, according to Reddit:
Intelligence
Obesity
Religiosity/'Irrational Thinking'

While it doesn't appear daily, the Eugenics circlejerk may just be a member of the circlejerk royal family. It encompasses other jerks and proposes that those who don't follow the jerk should be prohibited from breeding.

If Redditors proclaim to be so culturally open, why is it that when they disagree with a mainstream American cultural practice, the openness suddenly flies out the window? Why, if they are so interested in facts and intellectualism and Science™, is it that they take whatever they read on Reddit to be the word of law and don't bother to research these topics with a simple Google search? Prevalence of circumcision is actually greater in the Philippines and the Middle East, and the practice is also reasonably common in Canada and Australia. But if one has the chance to tie one jerk in with another, for the admiration of his fellow neckbeards, why not take the easy way out and simplify the discussion by making the USA the big bad guy once again?

---
**Part 1:**

Gather round children and let me tell you a tale. A tale of justice and injustice, good versus evil, light versus dark. Our story starts with a happy little redditor – for the sake of this story, lets call him ‘John’.

John was a clever little chap and a helpful one too. After making a home for himself in the kingdom of Reddit he could often be found in /r/askscience spouting insightful answers and divulging his wisdom of Chemistry to his curious young students. ""When paint fades in sunlight over time, where does the pigment go?"", someone asked. And so came his response:

&gt;The color of pigments is related to their chemical structure. Briefly, the chemical structure will determine a set of allowed energy levels and light will only be absorbed when it corresponds to the energetic spacing of these levels. Sunlight, in turn, can cause changes in the pigments (most often caused by damage from high energy UV radiation as you suggest). Due to these changes the optical properties of these pigments can change, such that they could absorb at different wavelengths, with different ""strengths"" (or extinction coefficients to be more precise). In some cases due to such changes the pigments will no longer even absorb visible light, making them effectively transparent.

To all who knew him, John was a pillar of the community. His answers were astute, thorough and backed up with references and eventually the wise and powerful mods of /r/askscience accepted him onto their official panel of scientists. John, it seemed, could do no wrong… or could he??

Askscience was not the only sub that John would frequent, oh no. There was one other place where he would occasionally pop-up. That place was /r/aww and it was a happy place, a loving place, a place where people came together to celebrate everything that was good with the world. John was welcomed to this promised-land with open arms - he'd surely fit in perfectly. But, unbeknownst to the happy little elves of /r/aww, John had a dark side - an unrequited fetish for the devious and diabolical. He had devised a plan so deranged and so disturbing I can barely bring myself to type the words, and he was about to unleash this unthinkable abomination unto the poor and innocent aww-folk.

**John… would repost pictures of cute animals. He would take pictures that had already been posted and post them again!**

See the examples below, if you can stomach the horror:

[The Horror](http://i.imgur.com/m65uCz1.png)

[THE HORROR](http://i.imgur.com/i3TaQ07.png)

[**THE HORROR!!!!!**](http://i.imgur.com/NbVGpa6.png)

John lived his deplorable double life for some time. He continued his good work in askscience, fielding questions from his naïve pupils. “What color is a mirror?”, one asked, trying to act clever, but John had the answer:

&gt;A perfect mirror reflects all incident light regardless of wavelength, say in the visible range. For example, if you shine white light (that is light with a spectrum such that it would be perceived as white by the human eye) on a perfect mirror, then light with the same spectrum would be reflected. Therefore a mirror can be said to be white.

He went on, but I'll spare you the babble. John was clearly well respected by his academic colleagues, but little did they know that behind the mask he was devoted to single-handedly grinding the good name or /r/aww into the dirt and taking all the link karma that came with it. Before his arrival, all posts were lauded as being the pinnacle of originality, but now they just seemed tired and oddly familiar. The elves had never seen a repost before and what they experienced was leaving them confused, frightened and angry.

&gt;as the owner of this image, I'm not sure if I should be flattered or infuriated by this getting reposted.

said one miffed OP. The next guy was a little more inventive.

&gt;Seven submissions, not one of them OC. You even lack the decency to change the title of the posts you steal. Dude, it's IMAGINARY INTERNET POINTS you're hoarding there. Nobody gives a shit about some number next to your user name, so please stop reposting other people's stuff only for your number to grow bigger. Also, this won't make any girl like you, so please stop trying.

and the next was slightly less inventive

&gt;Literally Hitler

The happy little aww-folk weren’t so happy any more. The sub was fast becoming a dark and terrible place. Someone was responsible and they had to be brought to justice!

---

**Part 2:**

I remember the night it happened. It was a dark and stormy night and John had just returned home from another hard days teaching. He looked out to /r/aww to see it ravaged and destitute. The monster had taken hold. A spiralling cacophony of reposts among reposts of reposts of reposts. Reposts as far as the eye could see and it was all his creation.  He gave a wry smile, grabbed his latest unoriginal content and set off to add it to the pile.

The elves, by this point, were on high alert. They scouted from the watchtowers in the wind and rain looking for something, anything, that could lead them to the source of all this madness. And then… there! In the distance! A new post popped up. Some cat… and a dog… with big eyes… looking fluffy. [THAT’S BEEN POSTED BEFORE!!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/tuzX2.jpg)

John looked up.

&gt;**Check out his post history... do it!**

one elf screamed (presumably the leader based on the number of upvotes he received). The game was up. John ran. The aww-folk mobbed together in a blind rage, pitchforks in hand.

&gt;repost slutbag!

one shouted

&gt;I've got him tagged as 'Reposting shitfuck'

bellowed another

&gt;We must win this war!

shouted one wielding his downvote fork.

&gt;“I am trying to fight him but his douchness is very strong.”

John couldn’t fend off the hoard and was chased out of the Reddit kingdom never to be seen again. But this was not enough for vengeful aww-folk. They wanted real retribution. John had gone, but his post history left behind a legacy, a legacy that had to be destroyed. Unfortunately for the aww-folk, the karma in John's reposts was now too powerful to overthrow, their puny downvotes simply swallowed up by the now towering upvote generating machines. 

More frustrated than ever, they turned on John’s one vulnerability, his /r/askscience archive. Upvotes in the askscience forum are given more sparingly and are used as a barometer of solid scientific reasoning. By downvoting John’s comments, the clever little elves could not only get back at him for the all those horrific reposts, they could simultaneously destroy his reputation as a reliable contributer as well. All of John’s comments, insightful and thought-provoking as they were, were mercilessly downvoted into oblivion. 

&gt;I DOWNVOTED ALL HE HAS SUBMITTED

boasted one brave aww-elf

&gt;Downvoted, Every single thing he had.

Another joined in.

&gt;Just to be clear on the subject... He has negative comment karma.

And with that, justice had prevailed. The evil chemist John had been banished and his reputation destroyed. The aww-folk could now get on with their lives, free from the tyranny of having to see posts they had already seen before. All was right with the world.

At first I thought maybe it'd have some interesting responses. Then I remembered I was browsing reddit.

(these are all listed from most karma to least, as sorted by ""top"")

&gt;How about ""If you can't handle me at my worst, you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best"". Supposedly Marilyn Monroe. Just a license to be a giant bitch

Reddit hates this quote and every girl that has it on their Facebook page. Not that it's a great quote to begin with, but this post is spectacular because you get the double-whammy of being able to make fun of ""giant bitches"" as well:

&gt;Ex gf used to use that quote all the time. She was a huge bitch.

-

&gt;Whenever someone quotes this I automatically register them as a bitch in my mind

-

&gt;Stupid bitches like stupid bitch quotes.

-

&gt;The only time I've seen this used is on Facebook by girls I always hated in high school. Huge bitches.

Then there's:

&gt;""The problem with the internet is that anyone can just make stuff up"" - Abraham Lincoln.

Oh ho, what a unique and clever quote. 

&gt;""Money doesnt buy happiness"" Suck my dick it dont. It gives u options and options make people happy. Think about it...

Uh huh

...what? 

&gt;""Everything happens for a reason."" 

mhmm...wait for it...

There it is!

&gt; We decided, (although we are both Christian) that shit just happens. God doesn't have some grand purpose for everything 

*So euphoric*.

Some people taking everything very literally, only missing the ""Dwight Schrute"" meme:

&gt;Aim for the moon. If you miss you'll at least land among the stars. (paraphrased?)

&gt;Just, no. You will not land among the stars; they are much further away. You will land among space junk.

-

&gt;""It's always darkest before the dawn""

&gt;No, it's not. It's darkest at midnight. Before dawn there's 3 stages of twilight making it quite un-dark.

-

&gt;""live every day like it was your last""

&gt;means what, spend everything, never plan anything, or work on anything else than immediate, same-day gratification?

-

&gt;Just be yourself!!!

&gt;....What if you are a psychopath?

-

&gt;If you can't be with the one you love...love the one you're with.

&gt;This sounds like a miserable life that will lead to an abusive relationship.

-

&gt;""It's always in the last place you look.""
&gt;No shit Sherlock; why would I keep looking if I found it?

*Thankfully*, some people point out that these things aren't supposed to be taken literally, but of course, they aren't nearly as recognized. I mean we wouldn't want people raining on anyone's parade, right?

I just don't think that this is an excuse to destroy a subreddit with memes, pictures, content bashing publisher of the game and downvoting everyone who points out the circlejerk and has a different opinion.

Hey guise. I bet many of you have already noticed that Simcity has been released few days ago and that the servers are still shit. How could you not have when /r/games (and therefore the front page) is constantly spammed with posts full of jerking and anti-EA semen. Our anti-EA hungry jerker can pick from so many options. There are, like, so many! [Selfposts about refunds](http://np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19unbf/i_used_the_call_you_back_option_on_origin_support/), [rage based rage inducing posts which bring no information but only provide space for jerking](http://np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19p4ks/thought_id_play_a_bit_more_simcity_before_bed/), or [""Simcity BAD BAD BAD reviews""](http://np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/19t1gj/simcity_35_on_giant_bomb_feels_more_like_a_really/). But since we've had here on CB already two posts about this, I'm going to take a look at this very shiny and original pearl - /r/simcity. [(play for better enjoyment)](http://inception.davepedu.com/)

I called it a pearl. It's complete shit. The shittiest shit of all shits. We, here on CB, have a belief that the size of a subreddit impacts its content and thus its quality. Well, this subreddit contradicts this belief. Let's have a look at few threads there and see if we can find *anything* worthy of spending time reading. 

I will try to rate posts based on my opinion about their relevance and quality, starting from the very top. The scale is 1-5, 5 being the best post (understand the worst). Comments are not taken into account.

----------------------------------

1) [Curious about the SimCity server status? I made this to help -- check it out! (self.SimCity)] (http://np.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19vsat/curious_about_the_simcity_server_status_i_made/) Rating: 2/5

In my opinion, this is arguably the best post currently on the first page of that damned place. No EA bashing, no server bashing, only user-made helpful website which can actually help you, even in small amount (you don't have to open the client to check the server status). Still, a neckbeard finds its way:

&gt;[What's impressive is that you had access to less data than the SimCity devs and actually made a more useful tool than any of their status updates from the last three days. Congrats!](http://np.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19vsat/curious_about_the_simcity_server_status_i_made/c8rrbig)

""I want to thank him and bash devs at the same time, how could I do this?""

Other comments are kinda manageable, like your typical reddit hyperbole humor (I use it myself, call me hypocrite): ""[Give this man a medal.](http://np.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19vsat/curious_about_the_simcity_server_status_i_made/c8rqfnp)"" and ""[Great stuff man!!!](http://np.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19vsat/curious_about_the_simcity_server_status_i_made/c8rqie0). Nothing worthy of too much attention.

2) [Polygon drops the SimCity score to 4.0 due to server issues (polygon.com)](http://np.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19vsmp/polygon_drops_the_simcity_score_to_40_due_to/) Rating: 3/5

This is the kind of posts our engraged neckbeard wants to read. Outside-of-reddit source approving of jerking to the max. You can see that Polygon started with rating for the game (9.5) and it's been dropping constantly. I don't want to comment much on it but there is one sentence that made me laugh: *""The experience currently on offer is now significantly altered from what was reviewed*, **and there is simply no guarantee that the existing server issues will go away**, *nor what further changes may be made to the game in order to address them.""* They are actually implying that the state of game during the launch days will remain. I haven't heard about Polygon until few days ago when I read the first review but this is completely ridiculous.

The comments in this one are about Polygon itself and other review websites and about their reviews policy, nothing too interesting. Or maybe yes:

&gt;[Good.](http://np.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19vsmp/polygon_drops_the_simcity_score_to_40_due_to/c8rqk9a)

An interesting comment section about how our brave soldiers against EA tyranny and renomed game reviewers at the same time agree with this post and how fair it is. 

&gt;[Fair review, a lot of the focus has been on the servers, while ignoring that there are real issues in the game itself.](http://np.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19vy0d/gamespot_50_mediocre/c8rsaa9)

Do I agree with this review? Is the author sharing my opinion? You bet he is. [**FAIR**](http://wl.static.fotolia.com/jpg/00/27/54/04/400_F_27540410_oSbw0t95tVrGkHSUiDAk3siRultDPde3.jpg).

Maybe a sparkle of hope, a voice of reason? LOL WHERE, NOPE.

&gt;[5.0 is generous. Once they start cutting more and more functionality to lighten the load on servers this game will begin to resemble a turd](http://np.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19vy0d/gamespot_50_mediocre/c8rs2lk)

SO MUCH? WHERE IS THE 0? This game is just complete and utter shit. The next step is to demand the devs to give free copies of the game. No matter they have families to feed and spend many hours coding it.

&gt;[World of Warcraft had similar issues launch week, would a 5.0 be fair for that masterpiece?](http://np.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19vy0d/gamespot_50_mediocre/c8rvhv2)

I actually agree with this guy in the sense that there hasn't been an always online game which had absolutely no problems at the launch.

4) [So I emailed the CEO of EA.... (imgur.com)](http://np.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/19w1a2/so_i_emailed_the_ceo_of_ea/) Rating: 5/5, WARNING: kind of armchair activism, he didn't actually emailed the CEO

The first problem I had with this is that it is a screenshot of his mail. I understand that it is more verifiable, that the mails are actually legitimate but there is that small karma reaping alarm going off in the back of my head. I was so relieved when I opened the comment section because the top is not flooded with that kind of comments you would expect but with counterjerking:

&gt;[You guys do know Sim city is the only recently released EA game that has always online DRM.
Why doesn't Dead space 3 have it, or BF3, or Mass effect, or really just any other EA game.
So maybe he is telling the truth.

THEY WANT TO HURT US.

There are many like these and one even starts to feel that it is nothing special already so for the next few, I want to concentrate on counterjerking in more depth (I grouped the previous two because they just **completed** themselves):

&gt;[You need to tone it down. You almost had a reasonable email until you tried too hard. What really got me was

The first thing that alerted me to the possibility that this might not be the place for me was the misogyny, racism and vociferous defense of friendzoned pedophiles coupled with advocacy of eugenics for everyone else.  These are reddit's most egregious offenses, so it's no surprise that these got to me first.

Next, it was the constant bad jokes.  This one can actually sneak up on you.  At first, I kinda liked that aspect of reddit.  Until I realized that it is the same shit over and over again.  I guess the karma system incentivizes short, 'witty' comments above all else.  Whatever it is, I think this is the thing that quietly grates on me the most and makes me never want to open another comment thread.  Maybe I'm just a humorless asshole, but I'm sick of everything being a bad joke all the time.

Finally, the contrarianism.  Someone made a good post about it on here recently.  You all know what it is -- I think we can agree it's a scourge on reddit.  As part of my doctoral work on why reddit sucks (I was rejected by the Julian Assange school for online bravery, so I'm now seeking my PhD from circlebroke ), I decided to investigate further.  

There is one subreddit that I believe most embodies reddit's contrarian nature: /r/science.  That is because the good redditors of /r/science will argue with absolutely anything, without fear or prejudice.  I actually searched circlebroke after I started writing this and found a very good, [similar post](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/search?q=science&amp;restrict_sr=on) about /r/science, but I want to take it a step further.  I am here to posit that redditors doesn't dispute the findings posted there just because they don't understand or aren't interested in how science works, but because they are simply committed, on principle, to arguing with anything, anywhere, at any time.  Period.  

My hypothesis is simple:  in /r/science posts, especially those describing the findings of a study, ESPECIALLY if there is any kind of social science involved, one of the top comments will criticize 1) the title, 2) the methodology or 3) something else they've determined to be a fatal flaw in the complex, professional study they learned about 3 minutes ago.  Sometimes they may even be right.  Sometimes they may be wrong.  It doesn't matter.  What matters is that they found a problem.  

What bothers me is not just that there are always critical comments.  Given enough comments, some are bound to be critical.  What bothers me is that a critical comment is *always* near the top.  I truly, truly believe that people go into the comments section looking for anything argumentative that they can upvote.  And guess what?  There is usually a response to the criticism that is also highly upvoted.  Why?  Because as much as redditors admire the brave soul who stepped forward to argue with scientists for the grave crime of asserting...well...anything, they also love the guy who argued with the arguer.  This is the dark heart of reddit contrarianism.

I went to /r/science, sorted by top this week in order to find posts with a lot of comments, and chose five.  I will concede I looked for posts that I thought would likely produce negative reactions, but all that means is I looked for post about study findings, rather than, say, the discovery of water on mars.  I didn't discriminate based on the content of the studies.  These are the first 5 I opened:

**[Study finds drinking soft drinks (even diet ones) is correlated with higher rates of depression](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/16ie2z/study_finds_drinking_soft_drinks_even_diet_ones/)**

Top comment is a direct quote from the article saying the study did not show the drinks actually cause depression.  

Neither the post title nor the article suggested otherwise.  Still, credit to this brave redditor for trying to find *something* to argue with.  He was rewarded with many upvotes.

**[Asking specific groups of drivers to stay off the road at certain times can dramatically reduce traffic](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/16m2hn/asking_specific_groups_of_drivers_to_stay_off_the/)**

Second highest rated comment complains that he doesn't see the specific groups targeted or methods for keeping them off the road.  

Good point -- should we investigate further?  No, because this isn't about understanding the study, it's about shitting on it.  Up-arguments all around!

**[minor \(even 3 second\) interruptions have surprisingly large impacts on ability to complete tasks](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/16jxfa/minor_even_3_second_interruptions_have/)**

I have to admit, reddit approves of this one.  I am guessing that's because it gives them ammo in their lifelong battle to avoid human interaction.  

**[A 14-year study of elephants in northern Kenya concludes that the adult behemoths are more likely to die at the hands of humans than from natural causes](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/16px85/a_14year_study_of_elephants_in_northern_kenya/)**

Top comment: National Geographic has been saying this for years. 

Ah, the ""no duh"" gambit.  We're obviously dealing with a seasoned contrarian here.  When the study itself appears bulletproof, just dismiss it by claiming it's findings are obvious.  Of course, the top comment responding to this person explains why the study is nonetheless necessary, but fuck it, this is textbook contrarianism and needs to be higher!

**[No backboned animal has been found that can harness the sun – until now](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/16tfx0/no_backboned_animal_has_been_found_that_can/)**

I don't why I picked this one, since it's more of a discovery type article rather than a study, but I did, so here we go.

Second highest rated comment points out that the creature doesn't actually use photosynthesis, but lives in symbiotically with an algae that does.  

That's right fuckers, gotcha on a technicality.  Well, as usual, the next comment explains why this doesn't contradict any of the claims at all, but the damage is done.  Another dirty lying scientist taken down a a few notches.

So there you have it.  Proof that reddit will argue with anything.  Now I'm off to post this to /r/science so they can tell me why I'm wrong.  

Edit: fixed shit.

I can’t claim to be unbiased about Obama, so perhaps this post might seem a bit over the line to some of you.

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/133uws/heres_a_bunch_of_cool_pictures_of_president_obama/) thread popped up in /r/pics recently. If you don’t feel like clicking through the pictures, the title of the thread is pretty self-explanatory; it’s a bunch of cool pictures of Obama. They’re all lifted from whitehouse.gov and rehosted on imgur (because you get the most le karma with imgur links) and were originally designed for the express purpose of making Obama look cool. These aren’t candid shots of Obama just being a great guy, these are calculated PR releases. Of course, you wouldn’t know that from Reddit’s reaction.

I really don’t have much else to say about that comment, but the SRS types around here might take issue with the man-crush wording because it implies crushes on men make you less of a man or it’s appropriating gay culture or something like that.

The whole thread brims with similar bravery; you can probably find the rest on your own. What strikes me about this whole thing is that Reddit, a site that prides itself on its ability to see through bullshit, suddenly becomes extremely receptive to marketing and loses all cynicism as long as the marketing is for a politician it likes. If a thread of humanizing pictures of Romney or Boehner or any other Republican somehow made it to the front page, it would be filled with comments about how the photos are just press releases to build sympathy and are little better than common marketing. But since it’s Obama, Reddit just drops its collective pants and grabs the dick to their right.

This, of course, is a reference to the death of Michael Hastings, who died about a month ago in a driving accident. Brave atheist neckbeards, however, aren't so easily fooled - of course it was the work of the Amerikkkan Obama Administration, notwithstanding the absence of anything resembling proof or even a casual link between the US government and Hastings. But then again, if it fits the pre-determined conspiracy narrative already formed by the brave souls in their mother's basements, speculation is evidence damning enough.

It goes on and on and on and on. *so brave*

&gt; Man, I hope he stays alive. Good luck to him.

&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if in the next ten days or so they found Greenwald dead. Sudden case of the suicide. Shot twice it the back of the head.     

and on

&gt; Headline in a few days: Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who published documents leaked by Edward Snowden, was killed when the American Airlines flight he was on mysteriously crashed yesterday, killing all 273 passengers and crew members.

**Bonus Round**

A day or two ago, the infamous former MLB relief pitcher John Rocker did an AMA over on /r/mlb, where nearly all of the upvoted questions were telling him how much of a racist scumbag he was or not having any real question, just being generally negative. I agree, he's a racist jerk, but that doesn't mean that he wasn't an exceptionally good baseball player with firsthand experience of the league and of other players - even if someone is a deplorable cocksucker, or had done something terrible in the past, it doesn't narrow their identity down to something exceedingly easy to consume for the sake of distributing everything into black and white - unless, of course, you're on reddit, where it's nearly impossible for anyone to accept the idea that people, situations and events are incredibly complex with millions of variables, because doing so would require you to employ some semblance of critical thinking where you'd realize that after all, you're really not that smart. Oh look a cat!

I bring that up because in this thread, a few people have pointed out things about Greenwald - that he's a for-profit journalist, for example, and he's conveniently timing the releases to generate more page clicks, or there is some other type of motive going on (questions like this *never* hurt, unless you're reddit because it's impossible for someone to be good and bad at the same time). We saw exactly the same thing with Snowden - Reddit's mind exploded that people were focusing on the person who did it and focusing on the fact that, by law, he committed a crime rather than focusing exclusively on the content of the leak (which the media did, wholeheartedly). 

And of course, questions like that are completely unacceptable for the hive mind. Obama is an evil dictator Hitler-monster, as their narrative goes, and Glen Greenwald and Edward Snowden are angels sent from heaven who spend all of their off-time rescuing kittens from trees and helping old ladies cross streets. *HEIL GREENWALD*

&gt; Greenwald, like all feature writers, gets paid by the article and The Guardian is a for profit enterprise and they are naturally going to behave accordingly.
These revelations are important but don't lose sight of the fact that although Snowden has moral reasons for the leak everyone else is doing this for a living.

minus 11.

&gt; If this was really about protecting privacy Greenwald wouldn't play up each ""revelation"" like a carnival barker.

minus 13.

&gt; Does anyone even know who Glenn Greenwald is?
After David Petraeus was outed and resigned, GG said it was abuse of the surveillance state.
This dude has issues. I think he was the perfect biased journalist and that's why Snowden went to him.

minus 29. This is a valid point. Greenwald's readers, even at Salon, were liberals who were afraid of the Bush enforced police state, and liked reading things that re-affirmed our already established political bias. But of course if you bring that up, you're a shill and you're just trying to discredit him. Nevermind the fact that it probably has some truth to it (it can have truth to it while also being equally as important as it is)

&gt; Fuck this guy and the guardian. He is staggering his releases so he can whore The Guardian's asshole for advertisers, instead of just releasing the information that is crucial for the survival of liberties. Block the ads on the guardian so you don't play into his next hand.

minus 19.

&gt; Handy guide for new users this summer: a shill is anyone who says something you don't like.
Greenwald has a well-known agenda and [his coverage on the NSA has been bordering on yellow journalism.](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57588337-38/no-evidence-of-nsas-direct-access-to-tech-companies/)

So there's your double standard: if you're a Reddit-approved GGG, anything you've ever done, or any critical thinking and questions directed towards the motives or legitimacy of the person or content are immediately dismissed, and the people who are calling to have these questions answered are ""shills"" who are, naturally, paid by the US government.

&gt;&gt; My girlfriend is the same way.

Onto extended comments with little votes but seriously no one answers the question: 

#
&gt; I saw it happen to my brother

#
&gt; My cousin got pregnant

#
&gt; My sister is what can often be considered a ""bad kid"".

Wow someone is really reaching to try to relate and post. PE teacher...

Seriously. Like... If I wanted to make a post about this with links and all that good stuff I wouldn't need to go far. The top comment with +1865 is ""Like a shark cage for black people."" While I get the joke, what is lost on the internet (and not clear in the medium) is the use of satire or if it is actually an honest comment. What is abundantly clear though is how it is readily apparent that Reddit thinks it is a call to be racist like crazy.

Are 100% of these types of security windows in predominantly black neighborhoods? Yes.

So somebody replies with a leading question to what I presume is to point out the flaw in their reasoning with, ""Is it because of their blackness?"" Which comes in with a paltry +23 compared to the not-too-hidden racist comment it was replying to. But don't worry, we have somebody coming in making a great point in reply, ""Because of a shitty ghetto culture that glorifies violence and ignorance..."" Awesome! A rational argument that takes out the race context and gives a real explanation... except that it continues... ""...A lot of ghetto black people accuse other black people of not being ""black enough"" to do something, and if they go to school, they are just trying to be white. So yeah, it might be because their self proclaimed blackness."" +117. Yay, more racial reasoning. While that argument is a part of it... I feel like the post overemphasizes it and just serves to argue a racial part.

So really, read some of those threads... they continue like that a LOT.

It's fairly interesting and makes some good points about perceiving an issue as worse than it is due to our focus on it. Now my question is what do we think? Are we too focused on the negative aspects of reddit, or is it really as big of a shithole as we think it is? 

  Personally I feel a little bit upset when I come to /r/circlebroke and see all the righteous bitching, but don't see any solutions in sight. I like to find a problem and solve it, not just keep complaining about how bad the problem is. That's why this comment tickles the back of my mind so much. Could we do something similar to the weekly megathreads where we point out threads that handled touchy issues well? I don't think we should stop calling out bullshit, but maybe we should start praising good behavior too. So, hit me with your opinions and let me know your thoughts.

Final Edit:

Thank you everyone for your input. I've learned quite a bit about people's opinions regarding this sub and my ideas. Moral of the story seems to be that CB is not meant to be the high court of reddit. It's not CB's job to point out what is in line with what reddit should or shouldn't be. CB's purpose is to call out and bitch about the circlejerks in its own self-recognized antijerk-jerk. I've realized now that CB can't possibly focus too much on the negative because is only meant to focus on the negative and because of that it needs to be only a part of your redditing experience. I think it's been interesting to see the CB community define its own role in the system.

Clearly this is serious. The most important aspect of any anti-America UK-jerking, however, is a complete disregard for the existence of regional language differences (which is funny coming from such a dialectically rich country):

There are a few upvoted voices of reason thrown in the mix from Brits who genuinely could care less about Americanizaton or note that it's not exactly a new trend.  Some Americans even step in to defend our great nation's honor:

* /u/SirDigby_CC suggests that 'I could care less' isn't actually that popular, we discover that it's probably because s/he watches British television and therefore can '[remain impervious to the dodgy phrases of your fellow countrymen](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/z6luo/anyone_else_noticed_creeping_americanisation/c61yiwf)' (though this may be true; /u/SirDigby_CC is such an anglophile that [someone called him/her out 'for asking where the bin liners were instead of the garbage bags](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/z6luo/anyone_else_noticed_creeping_americanisation/c61yluc)'!).

Personally, I love the unique relationship between US and UK culture, and I would be loath to see a complete Americanization of British culture. But this will never happen. Yet, despite their claims of being unpatriotic, Brits love to endlessly champion their nation's cultural/linguistic superiority, especially over the United States (they're so jealous).

The reason I'm unsubbing being that all the topics that ever hit my frontpage are ""The government is evil for spying on us"".


Now, before anyone gets the wrong idea, I am a leftist, and am not even american, so blind nationalism doesn't come into this. I *do* find it morally objectionable to spy on people.

But, Reddit does it all the goddamn time. Did everyone already forget how eager this place was to find the bombers? Using our 1337 haxxing skills to look for them on the internet?

And now the gov is doing, what, the exact same thing; using the internet and [facebook](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1fuv37/white_house_admits_it_has_access_to_facebook/) to seek out suspects. That, apparently, is evil.

To recap; Reddit is perfectly fine with the idea of people having their privacies ignored if they are suspected terrorists... as long as *Reddit* is the one who suspects them and breaks their privacy. Anyone else is forbidden, because that would be wrong. Oh, never mind the guy was innocent and commited suicide later, we totally apologised, 'tis cool.

I also find it dificult to believe that the government will have the time and manpower needed to read every single email from every individual, but when presented with the idea that the government may only scan the email of people who are already suspects of something, we get

&gt;the government will only search ""terrorists""... which means anything they want really

Not half a year ago everyone in this goddamn website was saying that ""terrorist"" was ""people who dresses in black and have a backpack"".



There is also the strange notion that governments spying on people is something new.

There was a comment that went

&gt;Back in my day there was great respect for private communications, and breaking in to snoop on others or spy illegally even got a President to resign.

Now, correct me if I am wrong, but I thought that during wartime, such as WW2, opening the letter the soldiers sent home and censoring any information, from the name of the soldier to the places it named, was a common practice.



But really, what is really making me unsub from /r/worldnews is the lack of variety.

The comments seem to go

&gt;The gubment is wrong to spy on us
&gt;&gt;Yeah I agree, they eventually will turn on us and kill us all
&gt;&gt;&gt;Aaaany day now
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yup, agreed.

All the way to the bottom. There is no useful discussion, there is no new or relevant information, there are no diverging ideas, there are no links to organizations that oppose the idea and which people could subscribe to, just people agreeing that yes, I, too, find this evil.

For me, the last one there is the most revolting. Not only are people wilfully blanking out the past (what happens when companies get *too big*), but they're actually making excuses for Google as to why it won't happen this time. Why *this time* it'll be different. Because Google can do no evil.

A couple down and we get to this [le] gem:

That's right. For Google, profit is only a 'vague direction'. Because public companies are famed for their consumer friendly measures, always doing the best for the consumer - at the cost of their own profits. So much sense right there.


'There is a lot of good that can come from google shaping the world to make themselves more profitable'. Replace 'Google' with literally any other company in the world right there and the mass of downvotes coming your way would be truly monstrous. Not only are these people advocating monopoly, they're encouraging it. Have they not seen the state of South Korea?

Okay people! No point fighting CISPA, SOPA, or whatever is the act of the week from now on. Privacy is dead so we shouldn't bother at all, right? If you transplanted this comment into one of the 'reincarnation of CISPA' that people have been raging about recently, it would be absolutely destroyed by legitimate downvotes. When it's supportive of Google... well... that's something /r/technology can get behind.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another response to the privacy concern:

&gt;[Please explain what you fear google will do. Read your emails? What makes you think they'd pick *your* emails? Or will they look at *your* browsing history?

This one makes me wince. Replace 'Google' with 'government' and you will be lynched. I could explain all that's wrong with this, but there's just so much - and you can see it yourself anyway. Note the excellent use of italics for condescension words just can't get across.

**TL:DR- Before I begin, let me say that the contents of the comments section are not terribly enraging, but the fact that this was brought to the front page alone proves that much of reddit has this similar mindset. With that said, let us begin.**

As of this writing, the top comment is a reference to one of reddit's favorite movies, so clearly must be voted to the top:

&gt; Gattaca seems far more likely first.

At least it brings up a marginally valid point, and the top scoring thread links to a TED talk. Decent stuff at first. Lets jump further down the rabbit hole, shall we?

&gt;Speaking as someone with a chronic illness I have made the deliberate decision to either adopt or find a donor when I am ready to have kids, and many others in my position feel the same way. It's selfish to pollute the gene pool for the sake of a mini-me, even if I am gifted in many other ways cough hugeiqandpenis cough

What? 

Wait....

 What?

This is appealing to reddit's upvote twitch-finger on so many levels. Allow me to elaborate.

* The, I-Do-This-Therefore-Everyone-Else-Should mentality. Other examples could be something like ""I am a black man, and I am not offended when my white friends call me a 'n*gger'. Therefor, everyone should not be offended. This jerk (for lack of a better word) is a good way for an controversial opinion to be instantly made allowable.
* Superiority Complex. Without the majority of reddit having any influence on what's being mentioned in the post, one could still, in the back of one's head think ""Yeah. At least I'm screwing up the gene pool. Screw those people with genetic diseases. They suck!"".
* And last, but certainly not least, the IQ jerk. Now, I might go out on a limb, and give the author here the benefit of the doubt that he was attempting to make a sarcastic quip at the end. The only other reasonable explination for the ending line, other than a sarcastic joke, would be extreme self-infatuation.But let me entertain that possibility briefly. Reddit loves to believe ^^[citation ^^needed] that IQ is the best quantitative measure of a humans self worth. This is obviously because the average redditor, probably does, in fact, have a decent IQ. Since they have this thing going for them, they might as well embellish it to it's full potential.

Further down, we find a voice of reason:
&gt; There is an enourmous amount of misinformation in this thread, so I will do my best to dispel it.
The answer is NO!
The amount of people with the kind of genetic defects that can only survive due to the advances of modern medicine is quite small. And even if we kept all of these people alive until they reached sexual maturity and they all decided to reproduce, then the percentage of the population with the genetic defects would just stay relatively constant.... [more not included for brevity].

Okay, well that was refreshing, let's see what goes on further down:
&gt;Never mind genetics. Hospitals alone undo a lot of natural selection.

Yeah! Hospitals are for losers! Good thing my healthy neckbeard self won't be going to the hospital any time soon! I maintain a rich diet of superiority and Cheetos!

I realize I'm being way overly hateful of this guy's comment. It's possible that he was just proving the opposite of the OP's point by taking OP's argument to the next level.

Turns out there isn't anything too bad in here, but just the fact that this post reached the front page proves something in itself. Here is the last threadI will dissect:

&gt;I talked to one biologist who said that this is already a problem, regarding infertility treatments. Infertility is a big sign of biological weakness (poor genetics), and my biologist friend said that infertility treatment is unethical because it will lead to future generations having poorer and poorer genes.

""I talked to one biologist"" First of all, there's a problem right there. That sounds fake to begin with, and if true, is far from a scientific study.

The rest of that sounds like psuedo-science, but I'm too lazy at this point to look it up to prove or disprove.

The next post in that thread is a somewhat poetically written piece, about how it is human nature to want to rise above our limits, and how what was once viewed as genetic disorders, could later be viewed as an advantage (referencing the Black Plague). 

Lets look at the responses to that:
&gt; Deus: Ex reference

Gold mine right there. Likely to get up to triple digits soon.

&gt; Speaking of plagues, what do you think the chances are of another 'great plague' turning up within the next few decades? Overpopulation is increasing, so infection across a wide range of people is possible.

This is something that has been thought by many many people, many times, but a good point to bring up none the less. Let's see what intelligent conversation it brings forth!

&gt;Not for Madagascar, obviously.

1344305537.0,94,self.circlebroke,xsugf,Let's see what Reddit's main demographics have to say on the parenting topic of teaching the body and privacy to a 3 year old. ,RhinestoneTaco,103,9,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/xsugf/lets_see_what_reddits_main_demographics_have_to/,"In the [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/xs7ap/so_we_have_been_teaching_our_3_year_old_that_her/), we've got OP explaining that he or she has been explaining the basics of anatomy to his or her daughter by referring to her private parts as the ""special place,"" (Interjecting my own thought onto this, but OP was most likely doing so to keep the child from saying/doing something embarassing in public, as kids are want to do) which then becomes a humorous issue when one of the child's books uses the phrase in another way. 

Awkward humor all around. Surely we can all just get a chuckle out of this, right? 

Oh no, not when you've got 16 to 23 year old mostly childless guys — you know, the paradigm of solid parenting advice. What does this wisdom-filled bunch of folks have to say about OP's story? 

Begin the lecture:

&gt;euphemisms help no one. 

And in response to that: 

&gt;They help parents who are too prude to be honest with their children

""Too prude"" in referring to genitalia being different than say, an elbow, to a 3-year-old child.

Deep breath folks, let's see how far the stern lecturing from non-parents rabbit hole goes:

 
&gt; A three year old has no problem accepting that a vagina should be called a vagina. The problem is that we call it cutesy things and treat vagina as if it were a foul word. 

. 

&gt; I don't understand, what's so hard about saying the word vagina? My parents always used the medical terms for human anatomy, had no impact on me whatsoever besides the ability to hear people say penis without bursting into laughter.

. 

&gt; Vagina' isn't a dirty word. Despite what Republicans would have you believe. 

. 

&gt; Call the ""special place"" by a the name she herself could have used, instead of some mystifying phrases (btw., is the concept ""private"" even understandable at that age?) - and this would never happen. 

. 

&gt; And this is why you should refer to the proper term ""vagina"", be a truthful parent. 

. 

&gt; At 3, it doesn't seem too far of a stretch to use a more correct anatomical reference? Especially is he/she is going to attend preschool.

. 

&gt; That is exactly why you should be honest with your kids, especially a three year old. Talking about ""special places"" and ""privates"" can be confusing and possibly in the future enforce a feeling of shame about something that is natural and healthy to explore. 

. 

&gt; Perhaps it would be best to avoid such confusion by teaching your daughter what her ""special place"" is actually called: her vulva. She knows what her nose, hands, feet, eyes and mouth are, right? The vulva and vagina are just body parts. You may stunt your daughter's growth by making her think that any part of her body is strange or mysterious. You may stunt your daughter's ability to be intimate with the person of her choosing when she's an adult by raising her to believe that her vulva and vagina aren't ever to be talked about.
The external genitalia are just like any other body part, they are external so they can be explored and aren't a mystery. By calling her vulva a ""special place"" you are making it seem mysterious.

. 

&gt; How about you tell your kid that it's called a vagina. That will clear up a lot of shit later on. Also, do them a favor and don't lie about Santa Claus.
Am I the only one around here, That doesn't lie to or mislead their child?

. 

&gt; Thus, the importance of using proper terminology early on! 

. 

&gt; Who the fuck lies to their kid about sex/gender/development/puberty any more. I mean seriously?

. 

&gt; Reason number one parents should just man up and teach their children real names for things. 

. 

&gt; ""Special place"" WTF ?? You couldnt have found are more retarded name for child's ""vagina"" ??? 

. 

&gt; Why not just call it a vagina? It's a vagina. Not a special place.
""Your vagina is private""
Problem solved. 

.  

&gt; THIS IS WHY WE TEACH THEM WHAT THINGS ARE CALLED. Vagina. Vagina vagina vagina vagina vagina vagina vagina. Read it over and over because YOU'RE the only one whose honestly uncomfortable saying or hearing the word from her. 

. 

&gt; I think using nicknames for items sometimes isn't the best thing. My aunts and uncles are racist and it wasn't until later in life when I learned that the item's real name wasn't the horrible racist nickname they had come up with.

. 

&gt; Believe it or not, little kids don't need special made-up names for body parts.

. 

&gt; That is exactly why you should be honest with your kids, especially a three year old. Talking about ""special places"" and ""privates"" can be confusing and possibly in the future enforce a feeling of shame about something that is natural and healthy to explore.

They usually rely on number of words per post, [readability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests), number of memes and things like that. I'd rather have a circlebroke-esque method myself though, so that's what I've come up with. You're now expecting me to just find the average number of jerks per subreddit or something similar. Well, I'm not. Here is the method:


1) Choose subreddit to use this 'jerkometer' on.

2) Circlejerking, as we all know, involves minimal actual discussion and continuous repetition of the same key points. If we want to measure the jerkiness of a whole subreddit, I think that this means we should be looking at reposts, in the same way that if we were looking at the jerkiness of a single thread we may choose to count the number of jerky comments or something. So, we will go down the front page (we want to measure the *current* jerkiness) and find out how many times each thread has been posted before in that particular subreddit (You can begin to imagine what will happen when we look at /r/AskReddit given its much discussed cyclical rhythms). This will be the jerk-rating for a thread. I'm only going to do the first 10 or it will take too long.

3) Obviously, take a mean for the front page and that's the current jerk-rating for that subreddit. 

Let's begin then. For text posts, I'm going to use the Reddit search function because I've just tried a lot of others and this one seems to give the best results for this purpose. It finds posts worded in almost exactly the same way (the search strings weren't often the same as the text and I was going to include them but realized it would make this post too long so just trust that I ensured that my search string minimized the number of false positives).  

-----

**/r/AskReddit - you know you're leaning forwards in your chair**

* Guys, what inappropriate questions have you always wanted answered about girls?
**4**

* Have you ever stumbled upon a dark family secret?
**50** wow (search string: dark family secret)

* What was the worst thing to get to the front page?
**2**

* Girls, what inappropriate questions about guys have you always wanted answered?
**4**

* Which movie would you say had the most unnecessary sequel?
**6**

* What stupid things did you do when you were younger to try to look cooler?
**2**

* What's the first step that you would take if you accidentally killed someone?
**2**

* Let's pretend Hell has a room reserved uniquely for you, what's inside?
**430** oh lord (search string: personal hell)

* What movie did you absolutely love as a kid, but re-watched as an adult and realized it was utter crap?
**3**

* Desk workers of reddit - what are the ways in which you secretly rebel against the man?
**1** 

-----**JERKOMETER READING: 50.4**-----

So we can see that we get some decent questions interspersed with a few 'jackpots' which are asked every few weeks. We should find that less jerkier subreddits have fewer jackpots then. 

-----

**Let's compare /r/atheism and /r/atheismrebooted and see what happens!**

*Note: since /r/atheism has been around much longer, it should have way more reposts so to make it fair this time I'll search within /r/atheism+atheismrebooted for both, and I'll split my 'top 10 of front page' between them, i.e. only doing the top 5 for each one.*


/r/atheism first

* I'm The 14-Year-Old Who Wrote The ""Jesus Isn't A Dick So Keep Him Out of My Vagina"" Sign In Texas And Was Labeled A ""Whore"" By Strangers Online (article)

A**1** + AR**1** = **2**

Riiiiight, we can see a problem straight away. Both of these subreddits rely on the latest news and/or new memes which means there won't be many reposts (if any at all) on the front page. We need a new method for subreddits that include articles and pictures (eh..that's a lot of them). If we assume that all the upvoted comments for any thread are all going to be jerky (because we're cynical circlebrokers), and therefore that the jerkier the thread, the more downvoted the top controversial comment will be, we can use the karma of the top 'top' comment multiplied by the absolute value of the karma of the top 'controversial comment', then multiply by number of comments since we know that as a thread gets longer, it tends to complete shit, then divide by the number online to account for subreddit size. This gives us a different measure of circlejerkiness. So let's try again.

* * I'm The 14-Year-Old Who Wrote The ""Jesus Isn't A Dick So Keep Him Out of My Vagina"" Sign In Texas And Was Labeled A ""Whore"" By Strangers Online 

**(921x3x1077)/1210= 2459**

**(22x2x10)/1210 = 0.36**

-----**/r/atheism JERKOMETER SCORE: 527**-----

now for the moment you've all been waiting for!

/r/atheismrebooted

* A meme to honor Good Guy r/atheismrebooted

**(20x10x39)/131 = 60**

-----**/r/atheismrebooted JERKOMETER SCORE: 16**-----

I bet that's not what you were expecting, given that /r/atheismrebooted has memes and /r/atheism doesn't, but the fact is, /r/atheismrebooted still has a comparatively low level of activity. The next two posts after the five I reviewed above actually have zero comments, which just doesn't happen in /r/atheism, definitely not in the top 10 on the front page oh no. At the moment, it seems that the big jerks are /r/atheism related (see the one that got a score of 60) and not atheism the subject. It's obvious that the memes are worse content, but they only have the *potential* to be more jerky then a text post. Without lots of people, there is no circlejerk (well obviously). The majority of people there seem to only be summoned by posts about the atheism-atheismrebooted war and so what I'm saying is that /r/atheismrebooted is not outjerking its bigger brother at all and is actually akin to a specialized /r/subredditdrama trying to focus, when it can, on its perceived superiority to its rival (in other words, most people must have only subscribed to keep updated about that war). I don't know how long this can last, given Reddit's notoriously short memory. As people forget about the war, will /r/atheismrebooted slowly die out?  I'm sure a lot of you will disagree with this bombshell, so let's hear what you have to say.

Now I did want to do much more, but this is a long enough post as it is so i'll save it for the next part, in which I will further utilise this jerkometer method and invent another one which none of you will have thought about before. Thanks for reading, and may the smugness be with you.

It may not stop the endless ""all Christians are wrong"" jerk, but it should be a step, right?

If that's what you thought, oh boy, were you wrong. r/atheism is jerking so much harder than they ever have, [posting videos to prove that their moderators are literally hitler](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fwf8a/hitler_upset_about_the_changes_to_reddits_ratheism/). It is jerking so hard, it even caused r/circlejerk to [concede defeat](http://np.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/1fsfsl/its_over_go_home_weve_been_outjerked_it_was_a/).

Most of this essay is based on the idea that r/atheism has two primary purposes:

* To provide a safe haven for atheists (especially including teenagers) that may face actual discrimination for their beliefs, or lack thereof.
* To instill discussion regarding atheism and debating systems of religion and the effects they may have on a society.

While this may have been true in the very early, beginning days of the subreddit, it sure as hell has not conformed to that vision for a long while. What was supposed to be r/atheism warped into a mix of ""DAE science??"" and ""Christians can go burn in hell -- oh wait, hell doesn't exist because there is no God.""

Which brings us back to **[this thread.](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fwf8a/hitler_upset_about_the_changes_to_reddits_ratheism/)**

In some sort of quasi-revolution against ""taking away our mee mees,"" a Downfall video got upvoted all the way to the top of r/atheism with 3,809 points, inspiring many a ratheist to chime in with some well-informed discussion about the new moderation policy that was put in place.

---

The first brilliant comment that we see?

&gt;holy christ that was well done. that seriously summed up the argument better than any post i've seen so far [+1593]

Honestly, I have no idea what ""the argument"" is. There are two possible interpretations of ""the argument.""

One is that the moderators banning memes has taken away the voice of rathiests in their own subreddit and takes away from the self-regulating voting system that has worked so well in the past. This would be a great argument if it weren't for the fact that it's completely wrong.

The moderation policy says that memes and images have to be linked to in self-posts, and not that they will be removed entirely; they would only be removed if directly linked to. So that argument is out the window.

The other is that forcing memes and images into self-posts makes it significantly harder to browse it since there are no thumbnails. Okay... so what? Self-posts can still be browsed easily, and if [one added click](http://imgur.com/a/nsOtA) on the front page is so hard, I have no idea how ratheists are able to remain patient enough to debate fundies.

That, or people are mad that they're being oppressed of their ability to obtain precious internet points for content that adds no discussion to anything (the point of reddit, might I add).

---

&gt;&gt;The mod system is easily the worst part of Reddit. No transparency, no voting power of the people, nothing. It is literally a dictatorship, and on an sub like /r/atheism they really wield their power like the fat little hateful nerds that they are. [+103]

Subreddits are **literally** a dictatorship and the moderators are **literally** Hitler.

If moderators putting images in self posts is taking away the voting power of redditors, the whole basis of this comment is that people can't get internet points now. In other words, the same, dense argument that everyone and their mothers have been using to bring back direct links to may mays.

---

&gt;Well done and you worked in "" Stalin "" on cue. up vote sir [+118]

le upvote sir? so well played.

Clearly, having the word Stalin said properly and on cue in a satire video of a movie scene that went viral validates ""the argument."" There are dozens of other comments in the same thread that are basically saying the exact same thing, increasing the noise in the thread and contributing nothing to anything other than their massive egos.

---

&gt;This reflects my opinions perfectly. I'm left in awe. Hopefully we get some solution to the current crisis. [+41]

""The current crisis?"" If a change to how you're supposed to post macros is a crisis, I wonder what that made the Cuban Missile Crisis. People are upset about their points, but that's no reason to blow up the importance of pixels on a screen compared to actual world crises or, if you really want to limit it to reddit, the doxxing drama that surrounded /r/jailbait.

---

Unfortunately, r/atheism, like all subreddits, is too large for any movement against low-effort content to succeed. Not only will people become pissy over something as insignificant as a link, the same low-effort content will simply take on a new form. A look at [the front page of r/atheism](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism) at the time of this post reveals these top links:

1. [Alabama gets their first High School Atheist club. Christian response - death threats!](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fx8gs/alabama_gets_their_first_high_school_atheist_club/) [+1921]
2. [Oregon Senators vote to require parents who don’t want a child vaccinated (for example for religious reasons)to get a science lesson first.](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fwfqc/oregon_senators_vote_to_require_parents_who_dont/) [+2041]
3. [Megachurch member was seduced by married pastor when a teen. Recounts how her mom and aunt had sex with the good reverend too! Oh by the way, he was recently extradited to Texas for the aggravated sexual assault of two prepubescent sisters. Three other pastors of the same church forced out also.](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fwgdj/megachurch_member_was_seduced_by_married_pastor/) [+1218]

It's closer to the purpose of reddit: aggregate links that interest a subcommunity, allow the community to vote on them, and then have discussion in the form of contents. Still, we see the same issues that have plagued it before:

1. **Editorialized title.** (""Christian response - death threats!"") The ""Christian"" response is the response of only people in that area and the story is intentionally bent to make it look like religion as a whole is the problem here, when the main issue at hand is the lack of education on the issue. Notice how the story is from the Southern U.S., the stereotypical redneck capital of America.
2. **DAE science??** Not particularly relevant to atheism in general and the title is editorialized to make it appear that fighting religious excuses was the main rationale for the Oregon senate voting to require a science lesson.
3. **Editorialized title. (x9999)** Holy fuck is this title editorialized to all hell. As soon as they see some sort of stereotypical child molestation from a church, it gets upvoted to the top. Not all pastors want to anally rape your children. Get over it.

Which should make the issue of may-mays on the subreddit seem relatively minor; which it's not. Atheism will continue to be confused with antitheism and fundies will continue to have their beliefs questioned by the enlightened and the euphoric, and /u/jij will continue to literally be Hitler, gassing memes, Sagans, and Nyes left and right and keeping their fedoras as trophies of war.

Whether the punishment fits the crime is debateable, but [Works bombs are dangerous](http://www.snopes.com/crime/warnings/bottlebomb.asp). The article linked  is pretty much journalistic garbage that makes the girl out to be a blameless victim, but the reaction from /r/politics is to jerk themselves silly over ""the downfall of science teaching"" and ""our overprotection of children"".

&gt;-This reminds me of the time we learned to make gun cotton, (a simple high explosive,) in advanced chemistry class. We ended up making a large explosive device with it, taking it out behind the school, and creating a basketball-sized crater. The repercussions? Everyone involved got an A on the project. 

   
&gt;-My entire physics class would have been arrested for our bottle rocket project.

Ah yes, these two situations are exactly compareable. Science projects done with teacher supervision in a controlled area with predictable results are just like mixing chemicals (with unknown results!) on school grounds. Schools these days...

&gt;-So the message is that kids should never experiment? And people wonder why the US is losing competiveness in the world economy.    


&gt;-[...] Mixing chemicals in a water bottle to see what happened. Anything that makes a 'boom' noise is not tolerated on school campuses it would seem.


&gt;-Yeah, back in the day, we called it ""having fun blowing things up"". It's not a good ""experiment"" until the firemen shows up :P.

&gt;-Absolutely, if you cant try for fear of being arrested we cant. Its curiosity thats the fuel for science.

Our children children can't do ANYTHING anymore. No wonder we're losing the science race!

&gt;-A comment on the website gave a phone number. Would it do anything to call them? I'm not sure what I'd say. ""In case you would like to call the offices of the school district...""

The comment also includes the phone number. I'm sure the school will appreciate calls from a bunch of redditors, especially since this is a police matter.

Speaking of police:

&gt;-You gotta remember.. Bartow is in Polk County... They are still trying to figure out how the fire inside a bulb doesn't die


&gt;-I'm sure Sheriff Grady Judd is strutting about how he stopped a potential terrorist over this.


&gt;-She's a witch!

Cops are idiots who are stiffling the natural curiousity of our nation's youth!

&gt;-Oregon cops shoot blanks at teachers in a surprise drill. Florida cops arrest a girl for popping the cap off a water bottle. How did our police get this fucking bad?


&gt;-The Terrorists have won

Cops are just tripping on power, man.


5 minutes of investigation would have revealed that the facts in the article are misleading or even wrong (if they even read the article). Instead, reddit likes to bandwagon about their own childhoods through the lens of nostalgia, and how the kids these days are doing it wrong or are somehow missing out. They think American schools are going downhill and is losing the ""science race"" ([which is wrong](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/talking-back/2012/08/22/is-american-science-in-decline/)). Plus many of them believe that experimenting with chemicals is SCIENCE!, when it's just dangerous at best. There are some voices to the contrary, but they're effectively drowned out in the jerk.

The link itself is bad enough. It doesn't post to an actual article or a forum post of people experiencing these problems or an official comment, it instead links to some random arab gamer complaining about something which offends him. While I don't agree with this gamer, the racism and general idiocy which follows is insane.

On top of the one I mentioned in the beginning, look at this comment. 

""complete bullshit, get over yourselve muslims, you dont get to kill people over a stupid ammiture hate movie and you dont get to have A MAP OF A VIDEO GAMES!,taken down for a pointless little insignifigant thing that has caut no ones attention for 3 years like this shit, fuck you sir,﻿ fuck all of you islamic gaming community"" 5 upvotes [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1141tp/the_map_favela_in_modern_warfare_2_has_been/c6j69xs)

A comment which slanders the whole Islamic gaming community because of one person. He also makes it seems as if Muslims are part of this exclusive group which enjoy games and only enjoys them with each other. I hope he's a troll but even if he was the fact that he's near top is downright disheartening.

FUCK THEIR OPINIONS! The muslims are retarded and deserve no respect based solely on one persons thoughts.

Honestly, the whole thread just makes me mad. There is absolutely no redeeming point in the whole conversation. The link itself is horrible. People are commenting with the only confirmation being OP. I realise that /r/gaming is a hopeless cause, but this is low even for them. I can't believe that comments like these are actually being upvoted. 

While there are people commenting on how bad the comment sections are, these people stay at the bottom while  and while the much more legitimate points of Muslims being horrible people stay at the top.

There has always been a presence of anti-religious comments and there has always been a constant presence of Islamophobia but it has seldom been as blatant as in this thread.

Sorry for the bad writing here, but this was simply outrageous.

Because they are constantly changing their phones and phone numbers, black people still rely on memorizing their boo's digits because it's not worth the time programming a new number into a phone all the time.

Consider this the study that follows its hypothesis.

TIL has definitely become what is essentially ""today I copy pasted a link from thinkprogress"". Curious as to just how bad it is, I decided to look at the top posts of various timeframes to see what, exactly, the topical shift has been. In order to do this I used the wayback machine and picked various dates roughly 6 months apart. Then I looked at the top 20 links for that day and picked the ones that I felt purposely enabled a reddit-style jerk.  My criteria were basically anything bad about america, cops, religion, banks, corporations, and republicans. I ignore any comment that doesn't have substantial karma.

**June 16, 2011**: Nothing. Special mention for ""TIL: In 1947 Sweden, a group of mentally ill patients were forced on a sugar paste diet to study tooth decay."" Apparently in 2011 the hive didn't exist yet.

**Sept 23, 2011**: ​It begins

&gt;*TIL - The author of the original USA Pledge of Allegiance, Francis Bellamy, was a socialist.*

Not necessarily a jerk, but let's take a look at the comments, shall we?

&gt;Pledging allegiance to a flag is just fucking ridiculous.

#
&gt;Indeed. It would be cool to live in a country where such a thing was completely optional.

(this comment is sarcasm, but gives birth to a few wonderful comments)

&gt;you mean in every other country in the world where it is not even optional, it is non existent?

#
&gt;It would be even cooler to live in a country where it wasn't drilled into the minds of impressionable children on a daily basis before they could even understand what they were saying

#
&gt;Your sarcasm is pointless. Yes, it's optional on paper, but in reality if you disagree reciting the pledge or leave out the ""under god"" part in some areas of the US, you will be judged by others and you can make your life very hard.

#
&gt;My favorite thing about the ORIGINAL pledge is that ""under god"" was not in it. Later added by protestant politicians.... To this day I omit that phrase.

That's it for the day, though. A fluke, perhaps.

**Dec 23, 2011**: It begins but even more

&gt;*TIL that the FBI and government are allowed to lie in courts for the sake of ""national security""*

Oh good.

&gt;This is why we need wikileaks.

#
&gt;the war on terror is the perfect excuse to be evil. 

#
&gt;The police can even lie while interrogating you. (Within limits.)

#
&gt;TIL some people need to read an intro criminal justice book.

There's actually a surprising amount of calling out the OP for sensationalizing, though.  The top comment even has citations!  OP replies with a video about someone who never existed, gets downvoted and rebutted.  And then, something amazing happens...

&gt;i guess i never bothered to look up much more on chip tatum past the hours of interviews online. that does raise a red flag tho, so thank you. however, i dont know if i would expect to find much regardless. im unsure where that leaves me.

It was a simpler time.  It was a better time.

&gt;*TIL During World War 1, German and Allied forces came out of their trenches, on XMas 1914, to sing carols, trade equipment and play games between their lines*

What a heartwarming story about

&gt;Regular men fighting their commanders' war. I will never kill another man for the United States, or any other country for that matter.. Sorry, Patriots.

ehhh

At least this was the only highly upvoted comment in that vein.  Jerk averted, mostly by people noting that shooting at a nazi war party isn't that bad of a thing.

**March 11, 2012**: Par for the course

&gt;*TIL that Tommy Chong pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute drug paraphernalia in exchange for non-prosecution of his wife and his son during Operation Pipe Dreams.*

#
&gt;I watched a documentary about this on Netflix. It really was a pretty strange ordeal, the way the DEA and government went about their business. They raided the guys house like he was fucking Pablo Escobar.

#
&gt;Such is life in the police state.

The top submissions of way back in 2012 didn't get a lot of comments (just 17 for this thread) so that's it for this one.  In fact, that's it for the day.

**June 28, 2012**: Trouble in paradise

&gt;*TIL on June 27, 1844, Mormon Founder Joseph Smith was murdered by an angry mob while he sat in a jail cell. The incident arose after Smith ordered the destruction of a news paper that exposed the fact he had married 8 already-married women.*

Top link, 2500+ comments.  I'm not even going to bother.  Just trust me on this one.

&gt;*TIL Louis CK dropped his management agency because they asked Joe Rogan to apologize to Carlos Mencia for outing him as a joke theif.*

Second link, just under 1000 comments.  It is exactly what you already know it is.  The top comment is a quote from Joe Rogan about what a hero CK is.  That's it.

&gt;*TIL an estimated 5% of US flights have an undercover Air Marshal on board who carries a gun and is authorized to make arrests.*

Yes, there's a TSA jerk.  Yes, it's got plentiful karma.  Only one thread though, so hey that's...that's something.

**Sept 27, 2012**: Opposite day

&gt;*TIL that every time he stays in a hotel with a bible in the bedside table, Ian McKellen rips out the page containing a quote from Leviticus that is against homosexuality.*

Can you guess what the comments are?  No, actually, you can't.  Behold, and be amazed!

&gt;That sounds like a pointless exercise. 

#
&gt;Essentially destroying literature, so the next step would be burning them.

#
&gt;Soo it's ok to destroy someone elses property as long as you believe in the cause? 

#
&gt;Thats a dick move. It has no real effect and is just disrespectful to Christians. Don't like it, don't read it.

All three with over 200 karma.  I literally would have never predicted this.  There are plenty of ""WELL YEAH BUT"" comments about how christians literally hate all gays, but they have 5-6 karma at most.

One person even said

&gt;The hypocrisy of the left, my man.

And got 65 karma.  What?  How?  What?

Don't worry though, we've got your murikarma all ready for you out front, sir.

&gt;*TIL an 18 year old freshmen funded his education by asking 2.8 million people for one penny*

#
&gt;Sadly, 28k is no longer enough to pay for a 4 year degree.

#
&gt;It is if you're not American.

#
&gt;Totally, my 5 years of schooling in Canada was about $23k.

To be fair, plenty of people are chiming in with either ""I'm American and got a degree for 75 cents"" or ""I'm not American and got a degree for 75 billion dollars"".

&gt;*TIL that ""America's public school teachers almost uniformly now come from the bottom 25 percent of their college classes.""*

Marked as misleading by the mods.  1000 karma anyway.  Almost every comment is ""as a teacher, nobody likes me everybody hates me"".  I did find this le gem though.

&gt;Teacher here. I doubt that things are THAT bad currently. The US education system does not, however, make a point of recruiting the best and brightest like they do in Finland.

:)

&gt;*TIL 8.8 billion in Cash , Shipped into the Middle of War Torn Iraq ""went missing"" is Unaccounted for and is Unlikely to be Recovered.*

#
&gt;Could also be written as

&gt;""Under the table payment received in iraq""

#
&gt; How in the hell does that happen?

&gt;On purpose.

#
&gt;Ohh, it got recovered. That much is for damn sure. Just not the people who owned and shipped it. 

**March 19, 2013**: The home stretch

&gt;*TIL Louis Armstrong smoked marijuana during the entire 45 years he blew his trumpet*

The comments are what you think.

&gt;*TIL the Scrubs episode which poked fun at multi-camera sitcoms won an Emmy for ""Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing"".*

Dozens and dozens of iterations of ""Bazinga""?  You bet!  ""I hate canned laughter but only when it's on a show I don't like""?  You also bet that too!  I'm not even going to bother.

&gt;*TIL: Hundreds of TSA agents have been caught stealing from passengers.*

#
&gt;I hope this doesn't suprise anyone. This is what happens when you create a pseudo law enforcement agency and fill it with underachieving applicants. 

#
&gt;Security theater is the practice of investing in countermeasures intended to provide the feeling of improved security while doing little or nothing to actually achieve it.

&gt;Beyond the familiar hassle at airport security, the TSA has actually caused immense material harm by diverting significant sums of money from projects which, unlike TSA, would have a measurable impact on public wellbeing.

#
&gt;How many terrorists has TSA reported catching? None.

And so forth.  It's hard to find a comment that's *not* part of the jerk here.  Plenty of comments about how they were taking their 4000 year old sarcophagus to grandma's and the TSA stole it.  

**August 9, 2013**: AKA today

&gt;*TIL Under civil forfeiture, police departments are seizing property such as phones, money, cars and homes from Americans who haven’t been convicted of wrongdoing, with almost no constitutional protection.*

#
&gt;*TIL the 'Department of Defense Excess Property Program', hands out over $500M worth of free surplus military-grade weaponry to state and local law enforcement each year, militarizing hundreds of jurisdictions a year.*

#
&gt;*TIL Ronald Reagan once said that the effects of smoking one marijuana cigarette is equal in brain damage to being on Bikini Island during a hydrogen bomb test*

#
&gt;*TIL that there was once a competitor to the US Postal Service, called The American Letter Mail Company, which was adored by the public for driving down the cost of mailing parcels and letters but was made illegal because it threatened the ability of the USPS to charge monopoly prices.*

#
&gt;*TIL that there are 3,778 Americans claiming Asylum in other countries because they feel persecuted by America*

So I guess what we learned from all this is that TIL has always kind of sucked, but about a year ago it started sucking hard style.  Myth confirmed, I guess?

www.np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/

He has been given a total of ~~24~~ 59 reddit golds.  In fact, every single one of his comments was given gold [as pointed out below](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/18c3j7/people_are_actually_giving_reddit_gold_to_bill/c8dmti7).  We're talking about one of the richest men in the world, and people are giving him something he absolutely will never use.  It astonishes me that a group of people who collectively hate rich people would also throw $4 at one.

Whoever decided to allow people to gift reddit gold should have their salary tripled.  I cannot begin to fathom how much money it has made them so far, and how much it will make them.  The current function of gifting gold is equal to a ""super upvote"" button.  It allows someone, for the price of $4, to literally give them a gold star for their comment.

Below is a catalog of his comments that received gold:

* [There are two things this could reference. One is the free/pay for software mix. The Internet has benefited from having lots of free stuff and lots of commercial software. It has been interesting see people inventing hybrid models. Even stuff that is pretty commercial often has free versions for some audiences. Even the most open stuff often have services people choose to pay for.  The second thing is the anonymous versus identified tension. This is another one where both will probably thrive since you want anonymity for some things and full identity for others. I am surprised how little progress has been made in the identity space but it will improve.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8dcpjm?context=3)

This one received an astonishing *six* golds.  All for essentially a politician's response to this question.  At least the top child comment calls it out.

* [Free software. Just kidding.  Books actually.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8dcq9w?context=3)

The gold for this one is either because he said ""FREE SOFTWARE"" or because he likes books.

* [Kids. Cheap cheeseburgers. Open Course Ware courses...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8dcsh6?context=3)

He's just like us!  He eats cheeseburgers!

* [I have enjoyed meeting other philanthropists and talking about what they work on. I think there is a movement to do more, start sooner and be smarter about giving. Philanthropy is mostly about a broad set of people giving but it helps if the most wealthy set a strong example...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8dctnm?context=3)

This is one of his more deserving comments.  4 golds for it.

* [I definitely think leaving kids massive amounts of money is not a favor to them. Warren Buffett was part of an article in Fortune talking about this in 1986 before I met him and it made me think about it and decide he was right. Some people disagree with this but Melinda and I feel good about it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8dcuvm?context=3)

Bill Gates has been a proponent of a higher estate tax for quite some time now, so obviously he will be given gold for agreeing with /r/politics.

* [Less than I used to. It was part of exercise for snow skiing. I still ski but I am not as hard core...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8dd5m4?context=3)

3 golds for that one.

* [He and I respected each other. Our biggest joint project was the Mac where Microsoft had more people on the project than Apple did as we wrote a lot of applications. I saw Steve regularly over the years including spending an afternoon with him a few months before he tragically passed away...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8dd9h8?context=3)

Bill Gates + Steve Jobs in the same comment = instant gold.

* [It would be nice if all governments were as rational as the Nordic governments - reaching compromise and providing services broadly. The Economist had a nice special section on this last week. Africa governments have often been weak but you can't write a check to change that. Fortunately the average quality is going up. Mo Ibrahim tracks this in a great way.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8ddcgi?context=3)

DAE SWEDEN?!?!

* [Vaccines are very important in all countries. Some of the bad rumors have lead to kids dying of measles and pertussis. We have backed some information campaigns on the importance of vaccination even in the US.

* [Higher is better.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/18bhme/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/c8ddrhd?context=3)

4 golds for our friENT Bill Gates.



I definitely want to be clear that this is not about Bill Gates.  It's about reddit gold.  I am just constantly astonished that so many people give it out.  Bill Gates probably doesn't even know what it is, so he can't give the usual acceptance speech edit that comes with receiving it.

Some of the stuff was fine, so I had no comments about them.  I just don't see why you would give gold for something like this, especially to Gates.  I bet he'll get some great use out of it.

-Edited to remove some of the better quotes.  At the time of posting, not all of his comments were given gold.  Now that they are, it's somewhat pointless to quote them all.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,1360643023.0,,,True,t3_18c3j7,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/18c3j7/people_are_actually_giving_reddit_gold_to_bill/,
1359255787.0,93,self.circlebroke,17cm0c,74% of French people think Islam doesn't belong into French society? r/worldnews goes full anti-Muslim jerk.,I_hate_bigotry,126,33,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/17cm0c/74_of_french_people_think_islam_doesnt_belong/,"Over the last months I have seen a new phenomen on Reddit, maybe it's always been there, but Reddits becomes more and more rightwing. It first happened in /r/europe which is infamous for its Gipsy jerks and now pretty much everything is in it. Immigrants = bad and animals.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/17bhk0/a_survey_in_france_published_this_week_revealed/) on worldnews we have another fine example.

If it's about France, brace yourself for some bravery, because then it's about muslims and r/atheism is leaking in.

The first comments critices the study for being made online, which is pretty shitty, but you will find those kind of levels of xenophobia in the french population.

This comment  [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/17bhk0/a_survey_in_france_published_this_week_revealed/c84526x) is high quality and explains other findings that  this study had and also this one:

&gt; You also see a great difference on eduction, it's mostly those who don't have any degree who feels that way.

Which gets shouted down, because it's not education man, [those immigrants take their jobs](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4zbdaifDF1rw082zo1_500.gif)

&gt; People with low education are the ones competing for jobs with immigrants. People with high education generally live in upper class area's and don't have to deal with immigrants.

[We also do have the ""Islam-is-not-a-race -argument""](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/17bhk0/a_survey_in_france_published_this_week_revealed/c843e4b), therefore I can be as rascist as I can be against those slightly not so brown people.

&gt; I kind of see it this way. Americans have no real understanding of how small France is as a country. Some people talk about driving out of their home state on a vacation. You driving out of your home state is like crossing the entire country of France.

France literally is not a country with over 60 million people! God damn it, France is way bigger than California. Geography really shouldn't be that hard. But this gem of a comment goes on:

&gt; **You won't see bands of muslims walking through the neighborhoods and cities threatening women telling them to cover up etc like you now see in the UK and France.** Probably some of these fundies exist in the US no doubt. But they probably rightfully realize they'd be heading into a beating or **lynching** for doing so in some parts

TIL Europe is literally Iran and I wear rose-colored glasses when I visited my neighbor countries and my own and I just couldn't see all those Muslims forcing women to cover up. Best part about this comment? It sits on +390.

I also like this very ignorant world view, since muslim always spawn from that Middle East thingy:

&gt; Because ""muslim holy lands"" are shitholes because of the extreme islamic culture. THey haven't seemed to realize that they cause the problems in their countries, instead they're taught from birth to blame the jews and westerners +126

.

&gt; There are too many Africans in France, particularly in the big cities - and especially in Paris.

&gt; Apart from the Africans who are well integrated and have jobs and act socially appropriate... (they are more than welcome) there are many who just hang around the metro, spit everywhere, talk in their ugly bastardisation of the language (the same as ghetto-speak), hang around in gangs and make visitors feel unsafe.

&gt; I hate low class black ghettoculture people, their culture is so ugly. They contribute nothing to society.

DAE hate niggers????! at +99

&gt; Unchecked immigration is not a good thing.

&gt; History shows that and common sense shows that.

&gt; Now, it's time to act before things get out of hand. France - and Europe - has to deal with the immigration problem before the situtaion escalates.

At +143. What parts in history have shown that? I wonder how the US would be if the founding fathers implemented anti-immigration policicies... Also how do deal with them? That's easy, let's throw them out!

And here comes r/atheism:

&gt; Islam isn't really all that compatible with most modern societies. To be fair, few ancient cultures are. 

+103

&gt; Islam isn't compatible with anything that isn't Islam. It's like the Microsoft of religions. 

+35

&gt; Islam is not compatible with any civilized society. They are a mafia. A movement of the psychotic. A mental illness. 

+4

So I give up. Enough wading through shit. It's funny how on par with the Republitards Reddit is on immigration issues. I guess the indebt analyzes will not go very deep and stop on the fact that Redditors never had to immigrate to anywhere or having to adapt to a complete new culture that largely harbors xenophobia. From this high horse it's very easy to play the arm chair society expert.

Right now the top comment is about someone whose friend is over in Africa hunting the poachers, and of course everyone commenting is talking about how  [noble] (http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/zzycr/as_a_result_of_the_black_market_for_rhino_horn/c698qic) it is. I love how it is a prevalent sentiment on reddit that soldiers aren't noble, but somehow this is. I mean it's not like these poachers are doing this because they are sadistic; they are doing it because they likely have no other means of making money as they are living in a severely impoverished country. It's kind of sad if you ask me, but no, all poachers are [less than animals scum who need to be put down](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/zzycr/as_a_result_of_the_black_market_for_rhino_horn/c699ahb). That comment is just one of literally hundreds I could have chosen; redditors sure are a compassionate bunch, huh?

The top reply to the top comment asks if [he is a bad person for hoping for the deaths of poachers](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/zzycr/as_a_result_of_the_black_market_for_rhino_horn/c698hvj). Shockingly, anyone saying yes is being downvoted. Who would have ever seen that coming?

One thing I find particularly hilarious about these threads is almost every righteous animal lover calling for the deaths of these poachers is a meat eater. The level of cognitive dissonance is truly astounding, especially when considering that a decent number of people [are saying how the horns should be poisoned so that the consumer is killed](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/zzycr/as_a_result_of_the_black_market_for_rhino_horn/c698qce). I wonder how this person would feel about the meat from a factory farm being poisoned? Anyways, it is almost impossible to rationalize these two views so redditors just resort to making jokes; animals are friends, and cows, chickens, and pigs are [friends with benefits](http://www.reddit.com./r/WTF/comments/zzycr/as_a_result_of_the_black_market_for_rhino_horn/c69941y).

I wonder if there is anyone in the thread proposing a solution to the problem that doesn't involve violence? Of course; the solution is [science and reason](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/zzycr/as_a_result_of_the_black_market_for_rhino_horn/c6977vj). This reply is predictably met with hostility and racism towards southeast asians.

The thread claimed that fundies were outraged, threatening to strike Dr. Pepper, insulting, raging, and not-logic-ing. /r/Atheism courageously decided to counter-attack by filling the [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151056393178870&amp;set=a.65046118869.76163.6278093869&amp;type=1&amp;theater) with reason and bravery... But why? The advertisement really had no controversial material and wasn't related to Atheism in the slightest. It seemed to good true...

I did some digging.

By now there are about 3000 comments on the post, but if you sift through all the shit and look for the earliest comments, you will find no religious related comments. In fact, the only religious comments are found after a sudden explosion of anti-theistic comments.

TLDR; Some poster claimed that a Dr. Pepper ad was being attacked by religious nutjobs. Shortly after, their facebook page was spammed by anti-theistic bravery... There were no outrage towards the ad in the first place, its literally 3000 thousand Atheists insulting an imaginary enemy. It's funny.

Gems from thread:
&gt; then why does a can of Dr. Pepper fit perfectly in a human hand???
checkmate atheists


&gt; The day your faith is shaken by a Dr. Pepper ad is the day you should probably start reconsidering your faith.


&gt; As an Englishman I always find it difficult to believe that people in the US will lose their shit over people ""promoting"" evolution.


Evolution is largely accepted as fact over here. It's rare, if ever, you find any reference to creationism in popular culture or main stream media here. And if there was, in the main, no one would give a shit.

That's when redditors cirlejerk over the fact that hipsters naming their kids things other than strong white names like Jack or Tom are literally the worst parents ever. 

[In this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1iq80r/i_think_he_got_held_back/cb7225t), a redditor is so incensed by young girl's hard to pronounce name that he rants on and on about it.

&gt;See, here in lies my problem with this unique naming shit. All youve done, aside from incredibly selfishly made yourself feel good because your child has a unique name, is set your child up for a life time of correcting people. 

This is essentially the crux of the circlejerk. ""The child will have people ask how to pronounce their name/it's selfish"". Who cares? Name your kid whatever you want. Name your kid Jim. Name your Jyme. Let's keep in mind here also that the girl this commenter is ranting upon hasn't good a weirdly-spelt unique name for the hell of it, it appears to be a traditional African or otherwise non-white name. Wanna live in 'murica? Change your name to Susan or alas you will once a year have to spell your name out to identify yourself (the horror!). This commenter, who's first name appears to be Tom, is actually complaining about his hard-to-pronounce surname, which if you're keeping track is the the name that *nobody actually chooses for their child.* 

But back to the white-people names like Jaylee and Cyndee or Heath (which actually seems like a pretty mainstream name to be it always is listed as an example) - there is an incredibly amount of hate for these. I don't know if this is a form of classism against what is percieved as ""white trash"", but I just don't understand how such a strong and shared dislike can evolve for what is essentially a different way to spell a name. [This fellow](http://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/12o1xx/kids_have_some_weird_names_these_days/c6wsh8f) likes to make a game of it:

&gt;One of my favorite things to do is look up stupid children's names and hate them.

In the same thread where people are questioning the selfishness of parents for these names, this guy just skips the middle man and hates the kids for a name they didn't choose. I'm not even going to mention the huge amount of racist comments ""black names"" get, even if they're not even the central feature of a submission. ""huurrr girl's names Shampayne, [bet you 100 dollars she's black](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/12o1xx/kids_have_some_weird_names_these_days/c6wscax). 

[This feller](http://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/12o1xx/kids_have_some_weird_names_these_days/c6wtex9) is quick to point out that some white people give bad names too! Quite the egalitarian. 

&gt;People give black names a lot of crap, but white kid names are getting worse these days.

&gt;Aiden, Rayden, Hayden, Caiden, Jaiden, Tayden, Payden

&gt;Hooper, Cooper, Wooper, Looper

&gt;Haily, Baily, Caylee, JailB

Today I learned that reddit loves creativity unless it means they have to encounter a kid who's name is spelled ""Haily"" instead of ""Hailey"".

Also, a lot of the comments are just saying this is Joan Rivers' thing. She does this all the time.

The cultured video game elitist over at /r/gaming have had their foot on the gas of that karma train since it was spawned and haven't eased up on the throttle since.

The joke of all games needing more dinosaurs has been around for a while. We saw it a lot with people saying Battlefield 3 needed dinosaurs and everybody went fucking bonkers when the cool dudes over at DICE managed to sneak a reference to that joke into the game. Actual dinosaurs were never actually added to the game. Much to ~~everyone's~~ a small group of peoples disappointment.

The jerk however presses on. ""Skyrim had mammoths and dragons, why not a fucking dinosaur!"" some said. Others thought ""Why don't the Call of Duty devs add a Nazi Zombie Like Mode with dinosaurs?"" Aside from those examples there has been a menagerie of suggestions for how games should use or implement dinosaurs into the core gameplay some how.

Well the latest popular open world game to hit the market is Far Cry 3 and guess what people think should be added to that game? You guessed it, motha fuckin dinosaurs!

In one day you've had 2 post break a few hundred Karma saying that Far Cry 3 needs some dinosaurs.

How original of you /r/gaming users. You've once again re-hashed an idea/joke that 4chan came up with into yet another game via some less than creative photoshop projects. Good job, I should get you an award. *clap clap.*

The comments are filled with some higher up responses that bring some reason into it all saying ""We need to make a dinosaur games general."" or ""So why don't you play Turok?"" or ""You know dinosaur D-Day exist right?""

But for the most part you get an assortment of comments like...

&gt; WANT!

or

&gt; I'm probably beating a dead horse here, battlefield 3 should have dinosaurs....

Or 

&gt; and have the game be somewhat hard[challenging for the players]

Or 

&gt; How long have gamers wanted an open world jungle game with dinosaurs? I feel like its been 30 years. How has this not been done yet.

Or 

&gt; I would play this game INDEFINITELY.

Or 

&gt; More dinosaur games in general!

So yeah the comments agree, we need more dinosaur games. Clearly it would make a bunch of fucking money and we'd all play it 5ever. It couldn't possibly be a hard to execute idea that doesn't translate well to a game; sort of like some story and plot elements in novels don't transfer well into the Hollywood adaptations of themselves. Nope! Clearly market research divisions at Ubisoft, Activision, EA and even our lord and savior developer Valve are asleep at the wheel.

Gaming industry get your shit together. 2000+ people on an internet forum said they have a mild interest in a game idea. Make that damn game!

 Disregard the fact that this community has a high propensity to piracy and that if you know anything about marketing(which EA and company do) only X percent of people who say their interested in something will buy it.

 Also completely disregard the fact that the game is likely

Clearly if you guys like something everybody else will like it and buy it. Congratulations /r/gaming you know everything there is to know about marketing and how multi-million dollar corporations make decisions on what to make or not.

Interestingly enough the comments touch on another thing. How Ubisoft fucking sucks because they don't offer mod support and that is a hindrance to the development of a game like this and many others. So really it is just an excuse to more so point out how gaming companies should allow more mod support in general.

&gt; Seriously! Ubisoft should release modding tools, imagine how long people would be still playing for?

and

&gt; Ubisoft...allowing mod support? That'll be the day.

and

&gt; This is how they should actually make games. Take a good game, and turn it into something else, while maintaining everything that makes it good. (gameplay, graphics, ect.) I would definitely play Starwars Battlefield.

So yeah Ubisoft, and a lot of other people should allow for mod support and that is a total hindrance to the ability for this game to exist. Disregard the fact that *[Project Crynosaurs](http://www.crynosaurs.com/)* [never went over all that well](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1168297750/the-lost-world-project-crynosaurs/?ref=kicktraq) and it was an open world Dinosaur fighting adventure game that was made as a Crysis mod.

Lacking mod support does kind of suck but don't use it as a reason to hate a company because some secret agenda stops a game you want from existing simply because it doesn't offer mod support. There are more factors than that. Lets put our thinking caps on and take a good long look at what it takes to make a game good, successful and marketable for a second.

I conclusions /r/gaming beats the dead horse yet again by injecting Dinosaurs into yet another modern game. We know this, the karma whores know this and the exploitation and circlejerk about how awesome dinosaur video games could be is clear.

They then go on to show they don't always think, and some of them probably refuse to live, in the real world because they are too blind to see how businesses work and why it might not be a good idea to develop a game like this. Reddit's scope is only within reddit, they are what matters. No other larger market demographics and past experiences could possibly influence what the entertainment industry makes or doesn't make. They, the piracy empire themselves, will buy enough copies of a game to make it profitable for *X developer* if *they(reddit and /r/gaming as a collection)* think it is a good idea. 

Fuck everyone else they don't know what is good for gaming. We do, we're /r/gaming. We're a cultured bunch of 16 year olds and the 2000 or so upvotes shows that all the other 16 year olds agree with me! And in turn will support you with our money. But only if the price is fair, there is no DRM, you offer mod support, the sun is up, my headband isn't too tight, the price is under $20, my thermostat is set to a comfortable 19.4444 degrees celcious, it offers Steamworks, full multiplayer support, free DLC, and if my mom will give and an advance on my allowance and let me barrow her debit card. Otherwise I'll just pirate it.

No one has ever heard a Pussy Riot song, knows a name of one of their members, could describe the crime they allegedly committed, has personal experience with the Russian legal system - etc. Yet somehow everyone is masters of judgment and arbiters of true justice, and FREE PUSSY RIOT THEY DID NOTHING WRONG. The whole things stupid. Its uninformed people giving uninformed opinions over something they simply have no business flinging opinions around. But they fling their opinions like monkeys fling shit and it's borderline insulting.

Anyway, something's been going on with a developer of a shitty little FPS game and Greece. The guys, developers for the ""popular"" game ArmA3, have been held in Greece without bail for over 70 days, without any conclusion in sight. Something may well be wrong here - at the very least, it's a somewhat interesting situation, I guess, if you personally follow these guys (which no one does, until it's karma-lucrative to do so). 

So where do we turn to for informed, reasonable discussion on this matter? R/games, which prides itself on being infinitesimally more sophisticated and literate than r/gaming. [This thread,] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/13b2y7/after_70_days_awaiting_trial_jailed_arma_3_devs/) submitted yesterday, reveals an utter dearth of interesting discussion on the issue. 

So, given 0 reliable pieces of information and two conflicting reports, one from the people who would say anything to get out of jail and one from literally everyone else in Greece, the level-headed netizens of r/games make sure to jump to the quickest conclusions they possible can, and obviously that is that FUCK GREECE. 

Some parent comments:

&gt;Greece why are you being such a dick lately?

Top comment. Whatever. Generates pun-related jokes and a vague attempt at a dialogue, in which one party asserts that we don't really know the details, and everyone else asserts that we know the truth and the truth is FUCK GREECE LONG LIVE ARMA 3 DEVS.

&gt; This is simply sad, I really hope they get released soon. Being accused of espionage for doing something that any tourist can do, is strange.

Except not every tourist works for a company that makes military simulators for other countries, not every tourist repeatedly takes photographs of something you are explicitly not allowed to photograph... Well nevermind, I'm coming close to acting like I have any information on the matter - which I don't. 

&gt;Isn't this borderline human rights violation? 70 days in a holding cell with shit conditions, no bail, appeal did nothing, and I am going to assume the legal system is purposely dragging their feet.

Look - maybe 70 days in jail is excessive for this. Maybe. Who fucking knows? Not me. And not you. ~~Human rights violation? What the fuck? There are people being bombed to pieces, people rotting and starving to death en masse across Africa and Asia, even in our own backyards - but someone alert Amnesty, a criminal is being detained in a country with is going through tumultuous change! I mean - not a criminal - just someone who, you know, harmlessly committed a crime! I mean - no, wait... He's just a tourist!~~ (Edited: This is something of a moot point and not something I would actually use in an argument. People have pointed out that this not a flawed perspective, and I don't want this one point to distract anyone from the rest of the post.)

&gt; Alright, Greece is clearly having a temper tantrum right now, maybe we should step away for a while.

Blah blah blah, FUCK GREECE, etc. Whatever Greece is going through now, it's totally useless to blame Greece in this situation. It's like when something happens in some tiny claims court or some backwater jail or some single person does something in America, and everyone goes FUCK AMERICA. There are two ways to approach an issue: the productive way, and the way where you boil everything down to a good guy (the criminal), and a bad guy (an entire country).

&gt; I'm sorry, but why is this country still a part of the EU?

It wouldn't be r/games without international politics.

&gt; Greece is such a shit hole of a country

Etc...

It's a somewhat tricky issue because obviously, if these devs are ""innocent"" so to speak, it's super shitty of them to get stuck in this legal morass. But literally no one knows - it's his word against her word right now, except their words are in another country over something no one has any information about in the first place. 

How do these people just leap on conclusions like they do? Why would you automatically side with the alleged criminal in a situation? Just because thousands of tourists each year might accidentally take pictures of a military installation, doesn't mean they aren't committing crimes - and if said tourists worked for a company that specifically photographs and models military installations to aid in training other militaries... I mean, isn't it clear that this is, if nothing else, an *unclear* issue? Grey, even?

Under the first parent comment is where you get a back-and-forth dialogue, which is something at least. Suddenly everyone's an expert on everything regarding this case, though. I'm not going to go through it but you can see the back and forth for yourself, and see how, surprise, it goes nowhere - one person presents the snippet of information they heard from one biased source, another presents the snippet of information they heard from another biased source, and everyone goes on 'bating over their outrage at Greece. 

Yes, Greece's legal system is probably compromised right now - and yes, like this guy says, ""nowhere should this justify being held for over two months with no bail and no trial date. If they are found guilty of a crime, then they should serve a sentence. First, they need to be given a trial."" I agree, in theory - but there's a big, real world out there, and frankly, I'm not an authority on how the big, real world works on a day-to-day basis, especially in a country in turmoil in a part of the world I am not innately familiar with. 

When someone mentions that maybe the dev's photographs actually constitute a security risk, he is downvoted accordingly, and someone responds with ""This would make sense if Greece was actually at risk of an outside attack."" What the hell? Are you a military advisor now? I just hate this kind of false diagnosis, like a country that isn't the USA has no reason to have a military or protect its secrets. It betrays a total lack of understanding of the subtleties of the regional politics, particularly, in this case, with neighboring Turkey... but whatever.

There's one little voice of reason that sums up the issue fairly well, in the same terms I've been going about it: 

&gt;[ We have two conflicting stories, and we can't see any evidence or hear any testimony to actually determine what happened. Either story holds up depending on the circumstances, and it could easily be somewhere in between.

It's just not a clean issue. Just like the Pussy Riot thing was, the more you actually looked at it, kind of a total fucking mess. But why wait for further details when you can nakedly speculate, condemning entire countries in the effort?

On the question of why it is an abuse of power that the FBI shut these domains down, one user replies...

Thankfully most of these comments are 0 or negative but some still have hundreds of upvotes.  In contrast the rational comments defending  a happy family are postive but have a disturbing amount of downvotes.

Honestly I find this a little fascinating in that it's a rare type reddit idiocy.  Most of the time we just have the basic circlejerk where everyone agrees with each until they collapse from exhaustion, but here we actually have two prominent opposing forces:  people that hate kids for being kids and people who hate those people.

The videos ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWgRHfN-2U4), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATJyx4jthH8)) are all over the internet, including on a few reddit threads ([1](http://np.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1gvajc/wing_walker_jane_wickers_plane_crash_at_dayton/), [2](http://np.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1gv49x/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/), [3](http://np.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1gv4bc/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/), [4](http://np.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1gxepj/jane_wicker_and_pilot_die_as_plane_crashes_at/)).

It’s amusing, kinda sad, and occasionally insulting, to watch redditors who are confident that they know why the accident happened, authoritatively “explaining” their incorrect understanding about how a pilot manages inverted flight, about how wings stall and roll, etc.

Worst of all, IMO, are the comments saying that the pilot pulled up into the ground.

...

&gt;[Might have lost some power, and he panicked and thought, ""oh crap, I gotta level out!"" In his panic, he gave aft stick way too early.](http://np.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1gv49x/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/caodei3)

&gt;[...he pulled back on the stick instead of forward and crashed into the ground.](http://np.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1gv49x/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/caoiiz0)

If he did pull up, it was not to climb. I say that because, from his point of view, the ground was right above his head, and he would not inadvertently pull the airplane “up” into it. If he pulled up, it was because he felt the inverted stall, and pulled just a bit to lower the angle of attack so as to un-stall.

[One comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1gv4bc/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/caoghec) even talks about how Bob Hoover’s seat came unbolted once while he was inverted and “he remembered to push the stick to gain altitude”, as though this is something you have to memorize. That’s like saying that someone was walking and was about to trip on his left foot, but then ""remembered"" that you have to put the right foot ahead of you to catch yourself. You don't ""remember"" this; You just act! If the ground is above your head, you don’t think through a series of rules to formulate the correct input: You just push the airplane away from the ground. (And if you push too hard and stall, then you pull back just a little to un-stall). There is no “remembering”, you feel the airplane and you command it accordingly. In any case... I really am insulted on behalf of the pilot if people are writing to say that he messed up the recovery:

&gt;[...you can see the elevator move in the opposite direction a pilot would move it in order to recover from that kind of situation](http://np.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1gv49x/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/caocmqd)

No, if you’re in an inverted stall (i.e. upside down), then up-elevator (i.e. nose a little more towards the ground) is what lowers the angle of attack. Think about it.

And then there are comments like…

&gt;[She was basically a spoiler destroying the lift...](http://np.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1gvajc/wing_walker_jane_wickers_plane_crash_at_dayton/caoalb0)

No, a spoiler destroys lift by deflecting air upwards from the surface of the wing, across a relatively wide span. Her width was a small fraction of the wing span, and while she was generating weight and drag, she was probably not deflecting air upwards enough to deflect lift. If she did, she would be pushed down into the wing by pretty strong forces.

And then there are a bunch of commenters who don't even know what a stall looks like, but find themselves in a position to critique the hypothesis that a stall caused the accident.

&gt;[This really does not look to me like a stall. It seems to me that the aircraft would have wavered a bit before going in if that were the case.](http://np.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1gvajc/wing_walker_jane_wickers_plane_crash_at_dayton/cap611f)

Nope, not all stalls are gradual. They are gradual in training airplanes and modern jets, which are designed so that the wing loses lift gradually, not all at once. (For example, most airplanes set the inboard part of the wing at a higher angle of incidence than the tips, so that the inboard areas stall first, but the tips keep flying - which is where the ailerons are, the movable surfaces that control rolling). But in an old biplane, or in a modern aerobatic airplane, it's possible for a whole wing to go almost all the way from ""flying"" to ""not flying"" in an instant. That's how snap-rolls are done: Get the airplane flying at an angle (slip) or skid, then stall the wing(s) on one side but not on the other, and the non-stalled wing(s) will roll the airplane around faster than if you just jammed the stick to the side (hence the term ""snap""). You can sometimes even hear the wing ""pop"" as it unstalls all at once and springs back down, since the air load (the ""suction"" on top of the wing) disappears almost instantaneously.

&gt;[Other folks keep talking about stalling - there's no sign of a stall from the way that airplane was performing.](http://np.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1gv49x/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/cao5xbv)

...

&gt;[Did not see any signs of inverted stall.](http://np.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1gvajc/wing_walker_jane_wickers_plane_crash_at_dayton/cao807d)

One wing dropped, then the nose dropped. Um... Those are two pretty key signs!

&gt;[Is it possible that the inversion could have caused the pilot to black out? There are people talking about a stall, but it looked to me like he still had plenty of airspeed.](http://np.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1gvajc/wing_walker_jane_wickers_plane_crash_at_dayton/caob7me)

Minus one G is not enough for blacking out, unless your health is pretty poor, in which case you probably would not pass an FAA medical (let alone be flying at airshows just above the surface)…

I’m not going to reply to all such comments here, but you get the idea.

(And then there were all these comments ([1](http://np.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1gv49x/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/cao459p), [2](http://np.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1gv4bc/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/caogqb8)) that basically ask “Why risk your life (and the airplane) doing these stunts? This is so stupid”. I know it’s a rhetorical question, but it’s an annoying one. Why do people bungee-jump, sky-dive, jump off cliffs wearing wing-suits, post videos of this on YouTube… or at least watch the videos? People do it because they like the adrenaline, and because they feel that there are practices/features that reduce the risk to acceptable levels. I mean, driving is relatively dangerous, people die in cars every day, but we all do it because it’s “safe enough”. As for the spectators, people watch because -1- it’s fun to vicariously imagine what it must be like to be the one doing the stunt, -2- we get an adrenaline rush from watching a death-defying stunt, and -3- it’s impressive to watch a skilled person doing something hard. Duh. Are these things really not clear to most people?)

To reddit’s credit, though, lots of people do know what they’re talking about, and they even occasionally post a comment. It’s too bad that they don’t usually get upvoted to the top:

&gt;[Looks like the pilot tried to pick up the low wing but it stalled and spun the aircraft. Almost certainly that was uncommanded roll with insufficient height to recover.](http://np.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1gvajc/wing_walker_jane_wickers_plane_crash_at_dayton/cao6lai)

&gt;[Looked to me like only one wing stalled.](http://np.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1gv49x/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/cao6cds?context=1)

Of course, maybe I’m wrong. It looks to me (and to pretty much all actually-knowledgeable commenters) like the left wing stalled (starting what was essentially an unintentional snap-roll) and the pilot gave some up-elevator to lower the angle of attack and undo the stall. But maybe the left wing did not stall, maybe there was an uncommanded elevator deflection that pointed the nose down into the ground, caused by something like the elevator cable snapping:

&gt;[It appears to me that the cable to the elevator snapped or came loose.](http://np.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1gv49x/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/caocmqd)

...

&gt;[For it to just jerk upwards after the pilot kept control means that maybe the cable connecting the pilot's controls with the elevator snapped or suffered a similar failure.](http://np.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1gv49x/wing_walkers_plane_crashes_at_dayton_air_show/caoj84p)

...

&gt;[Wonder if something broke going to the elevator?](http://np.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1gvajc/wing_walker_jane_wickers_plane_crash_at_dayton/cap7vg8)

Only the NTSB could rule that out. But the rolling just prior to impact indicates to me that something else (at least in addition to elevator mechanism failure) was also going on.

In any case, the point is… Just because someone on the internet says “That does not look like a stall! Trust me, I know what I’m talking about”, that doesn’t mean it’s true.

(And for what it’s worth: I’m an aeronautical engineer, an aerobatic pilot, I have years of experience photographing and writing about the airshow industry, and I’ve even been in an airplane accident myself, so… Trust me, I know what I’m talking about ;] )

So let's get this straight. Since 9/11, the United States has suddenly turned from a liberal utopia to a repressive police state. I may be wrong but the only time I've really seen any form of repression towards US citizens is through the mandated airport security checks bolstered post-9/11 and the police brutality experienced in some parts of the Occupy Wall Street movement. I think the reaction to 9/11 has been understandable considering a group of al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked three planes and crashed them with the intention to kill as many people as possible. There is also the PRISM program but the effects of that on US citizens is still debateable.

The USA clearly wants to prevent another 9/11 especially when the threat of Islamic terrorism is at an all-time high. Now picture yourself as one of thousands of people in a skyscraper. Now imagine that a plane crashed into the building about five floors above you. How dead are you right now? Does *anybody*, let alone *civilians* deserve to have their life abruptly end like that because some terrorists don't agree with the West's foreign policy and cultural differences?

Usually if you lose your home, that means you've plunged yourself into a lot of debt or can't pay your mortgage. I may be wrong but I'm pretty sure it's a case of managing one's finances better.

Oh and this Occupy Wall Street stuff? Isn't this the way the world has always been? 200 years ago, did you get the luxury of a decent home and virtually unlimited (provided your ISP didn't rape you with data caps) access to the world wide web? No. Did the internet or any form of electronics even exist back then? No. Did you get the comfort of being able to eat a wide variety of things let alone get three decent meals on your plate every day? Probably not. Could you even afford luxuries in those days? Nope. Did you get the right to vote on your form of representative government? Nope. Usually in the old days anybody who wasn't filthy rich was disenfranchised.

Has America *truly* been free either? Have we seen non-whites, the American working class and women given the same amount of freedom as they were post-1776? Nope. From what I recall the United States was one of the last Western countries to abolish slavery, had a civil war partially over the issue, and had many years of overt racial segregation.

&gt; How can you truly believe it's just a matter of time before this happens 'here' (which I assume is America because everyone is American, right?), and then go on to give the most pertinent reason why it will never happen in America, ever?

&gt; In America, people have shit to lose. Yeah, the NSA will listen to your calls, but you still get to eat steak, and go to work, and watch TV, so no-one gives a shit.

&gt; Not only that, but your country is divided 50/50. If the Democrats start protesting, the Republicans will go against it, just because that's the way it is, and it will only get worse. You'll never ever be 'one true nation' because you're too big, and far too diverse. The United States of America does not, and will not, exist. America is just too comfortable.

Well he's right. Things are too good in the Western world to really go out on protest.

I will be sticking to TIL posts here but I am sure there are many better examples.

**Gandhi** The most upvoted TIL post when one searches for “Gandhi” is titled [Gandhi used to sleep naked next to young Indian girls in order to test his resolve to chastity](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10rvqm/til_that_gandhi_used_to_sleep_naked_next_to_young/)

The comments are fairly full of [jokes about his resolve breaking](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10rvqm/til_that_gandhi_used_to_sleep_naked_next_to_young/c6g8i2h) though there is no actual evidence in the article to suggest that any such thing occurred. One commenter also points out the article may be somewhat untrustworthy given that [the author doubts the link between HIV and AIDS](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/10rvqm/til_that_gandhi_used_to_sleep_naked_next_to_young/c6g9hfi).

**Martin Luther King Jr.** You need look a touch lower to find the bad information on MLK. It takes until the 5th highest rated post, but the top under “relevant” to find that [King thought homosexuality was a medical problem](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1b41l9/til_martin_luther_king_jr_said_homosexuality_was/?sort=hot)

Though the first comment attributes it to his time and occupation the two top comments with 562 and 81 points claim that his time period does not count as an excuse. Now that may be true but it is important to realize that it was not until 1973 that even the APA stopped considering homosexuality a mental disorder

**Harvey Milk** The third highest rated TIL relating to Harvey Milk [talks about him defending Jim Jones of Jonestown](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/18alkw/til_nine_months_before_the_jonestown_massacre_gay/) Only seven comments on this one however so not much there.

**Mother Teresa** The top post is about her [withholding painkillers from her patients](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1b1ft3/til_that_mother_teresa_believed_suffering_brought/) Dispite the fact that [the top comment provides a strong arguement](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1b1ft3/til_that_mother_teresa_believed_suffering_brought/c92r8ga) which says that it is actually a lie.

The second post appears to come from r/atheism and was nicely covered [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/19l3f0/the_antimother_teresa_jerk_returns_with_a/)

The 5th article then talks about how she [once thought AIDS was retribution for improper sexual conduct](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1bnbxm/til_mother_teresa_once_suggested_that_aids_might/) from which the top comment is [the Penn and Teller episode which seems to come up whenever any mention of her appears.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc732uzUkw4)


**John Lennon** Though certainly not as notable as some of the above figures John Lennon is usually seen as a pretty good guy however the most relevant and 7th top rated post declares that [he was not at all peaceful and beat his first wife](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ue8u5/til_that_john_lennon_was_not_as_peaceful_of_a_man/?sort=top) The top comment restates the title then proceeds to devolve into beatles lyrics. The second comment also attacks him but for a materialistic lifestyle.

&gt;and on and on. And you're like 'what the fuck is going on'?

&gt;Well, what's going on is that, as one side of our 2 party ideology is waning (conservatism) after its 40 year run as the dominant ideology, that ideology sees the writing on the wall and can see the other ideology (progressivism) taking over. That drives them, the conservatives, quite apoplectic and forces them to behave like irrational children holding on for dear life to the ideas they hold dear.

&gt;And it's gonna get worse before it gets better. Until more and more of America smacks down these right wing fringe folks, they will continue to claw and scratch for these ridiculous conservative extremes.

&gt;Specifically, MacDonald eventually was convicted of soliciting a minor to commit the felony of violating Virginia's ""Crimes Against Nature"" statute, or sodomy law.



&gt;Although the U.S. Supreme Court is generally viewed as having struck down sodomy laws in the 2003 case of Lawrence v. Texas, the court's action in the case does not actually take the laws off the books, but rather renders them unconstitutional to be enforced. Few states have, in fact, repealed the laws since then. Cuccinelli's office argues further that the Lawrence decision doesn't render sodomy laws unconstitutional in all situations and that it is constitutional to apply the law in this situation because it involves a minor.

Truly a Circlebroke Gem that unfortunately was championed before it's time. The post itself is the smuggest slacktivist pat on the back you can possibly imagine.

&gt;[This would have... so much power. Think: we as individuals have a limited amount of how much we can donate to each cause, and an even smaller limit if we want to remain unitemized and anonymous.

&gt;[I wrote this on another thread, but it seems more applicable here:
Lately I feel like Reddit is quickly becoming quite a powerful humanitarian organization, and what's even more amazing is how broad our abilities to change and contribute are. We can help you find your long lost family, exact justice on your abusive father, raise money for doctors without borders, raise awareness for both good and bad legislation, or simply help you when you're in need, the list goes on and on.

It's like everyone puts up their finger and all at once goes ""Um ahem yes did you know . . ."" 

Let's take [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1015r4/russia_has_just_declassified_news_that_will_shake/), for example. Even though it's actually quite old news about Russia's place in the diamond market, let's see how many people are going to make sure they post that they are aware of the fact De Beers has a manipulative stake in the diamond pricing market:

&gt;Diamonds are not rare. Diamond prices have been artificially inflated by Debeers for over 100 years.

-

&gt;Supply has always been controlled tightly by De Beers to make the world think diamonds are rare.

-

&gt;and they aren't worth much if you can't get a skilled craftsman to cut them. That's how DeBeers really controls the price of diamonds.

-

&gt;I was wondering if the DeBeer defenders would hop in here. Good to know.
As for ""more than a decade ago"", DeBeers is still settling with the Federal Courts in the US - In April 2008, De Beers confirmed that Judge Chesler of the US Federal District Court in New Jersey had entered an order approving the Settlement, resulting in a settlement arrangement totalling $295 million USD. De Beers does not admit liability. 

-

&gt;It doesn't matter, Space Diamonds or synthetic lab diamonds, DeBeers controls the non-industrial supply chain for diamonds globally.
Until DeBeers hold on the jewelry industry is broken, diamonds are going to always be impacted by what DeBeers wants to do. 

-

&gt; It's true--diamonds aren't rare. DeBeers just buys up every mine and controls the outflow.

-

&gt; OPEC, DeBeers... Both cartels. 

-

&gt; deBeers has done an excellent job of convincing the world that real diamonds mean real love. There are hundreds of millions of people who believe that to be true.

-

&gt; That's what the De Beers family does. Create an artificial limit on supply. 

-

&gt; The greatest marketing strategy ever done was done by DeBeers when they made diamonds seem rare, and a must have for any engagement/wedding ring...

-

&gt; I was under the impression that the market for diamonds was a sham anyway, simply a result of De Beers' stockpiling and marketing techniques. Is this not the case?

-

&gt;This won't change anything, as the value of diamonds has been grotesquely inflated by buggered information propegated primareily by DeBeers.

-

&gt; This is not surprising, it's know that the Debeers has been buying diamonds from russia for years in order to keep prices artificially low and control the market, due to knowledge that russia could essentially flood the market if they sold to other Jewellers.

-

&gt; Debeers must not be too happy. I wonder if theyre going to limit release like debeers does, or just completely ruin the market. 

-

&gt;The diamond mines discovered in Africa owned by Debeers were filled to the brim, making the diamond almost worthless.  

-

&gt; Better get on that De Beers. just make sure no one finds out about your trillions of carats in storage. 

-

&gt; Good- hopefully this can upset De Beers and all of those other evil shitty shady companies that currently dominate the market. 

-

&gt; I remember watching an 60 Minutes (or maybe 20/20) piece a few years ago about one of the world's leading diamond companies, DeBeers. In the video, they showed warehouses full of diamonds and made the case that DeBeers and companies like them create shortages artificially. 

-

Not condoning De Beers and their manipulation of a given market in such a way -- this post isn't about that. It's about everyone rushing to give them same fact. To make sure everyone knows they know about something.

I remember being in art school and putting my heart and soul into pieces, making sure that I really felt something and knowing that I had done something great. I remember spending so much time on a piece and knowing that I was doing what was right, what was expressive and important to me. I valued my teacher's opinions and my peers. I tried to work towards breaking my old habits and to try not to use devices such as copying styles or creating things that weren't authentic or genuine. That's before I realized what the art circlejerk is all about.

The circlejerk is over stereotypes. I would repeatedly make pieces of art and put them up for critique. The classes would always have a handful of people who were bullshitters. People who'd spend less than an hour on a piece and just wing it, cling to some sort of excuse as to why they decided to create such a piece or do such a thing. Eventually I realized that many of these people were getting very good grades and receiving higher praise than some of the students who worked pretty damn hard. That's when I started to realize it wasn't the art or the piece that they were judging, it was our stereotypes. If you were a woman you automatically had more to say. You automatically had been treated unfairly and your art automatically meant more because you had faced some sort of struggle. If you're black, especially if you were quiet or distant, you could literally take your preliminary sketches, unfinished, unresolved, put them up for critique and people would praise you. If you were gay then it was game over. You were loved, you needed our support and everything you made would be gold, but if you're white heterosexual male, you're probably drawing women because you're a misogynist, you probably depict struggle because you're violent, and you probably paint flowers to make you seem sensitive to help you get laid.

This bullshit became very apparent to me when I decided to try such a device and to make a piece explaining that I was synesthetic and Jewish. The teacher / many of the students had no clue that I had grown up a Jew in the bible belt and felt a lot of pressure and been through some weird struggles but somehow, just because I framed my piece of art with such a context, my art started to matter, to cause people to stop and ask questions, and my grades improved. My teacher started to seem like he genuinely cared about my opinion. It wasn't because I had spent 10+ hours painting or sculpting, it was because it helped put me into a new box, one that people could quickly digest because they felt like I had something to offer them, some sort of pity they could give me to resolve their own guilt, so that they wouldn't be labeled as oppressive, as judgmental. I quickly realized it was bullshit and changed majors to graphic design. Great move on my part. Here, people don't judge your work based on whether or not you fit into a artistic stereotype, here it's based on the quality of your work, and yeah it's devoid a bit of that humanity, that struggle that you find in looking at brush strokes, but it's not completely gone and the bullshit is known to be bullshit.

r/art has a nasty habit of over critiquing pieces that seem amateur. That use colored pencils instead of oil paints. Drug art gets railed. Hyper realism is trying too hard. If you're influenced by something pop culture and you're not critiquing it, you're not making art. However, all of this changes when you frame something with some sort of personality trait that makes you unique. Now, I don't imagine that everyone here is going to see this the same way I do, some people genuinely may find this piece to be very very interesting, but I can't help but see that this is all a charade, that people are completely looking past the actual art presented and are being overwhelmed by the context that this person is 'unique' and has a different way of seeing things and therefore this person's art matters. http://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/wuwlj/i_have_synesthesia_and_this_is_how_sweet_child_o/

Ok, so [here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1iisvc/dudes_pick_a_fight_with_the_wrong_skinny_white_kid/) is a post from /r/videos that shows what appears to be a bar fight between a few men.   Not only do we get some de facto racism in this thread, but we also get an idea of how detached from reality Redditors are when you are getting users condoning life-threatening attacks on subdued victims because in a fight 'there are no rules'.

Ok, first off the title.  All one has to do is watch the video and it would appear quite quickly that the 'skinny white dude' is the one who started it.  Not only does he throw the first punch, but the 3 guys in the group look as if they want to leave.  White guy punches one of the, punched guy understandably retaliates and his friends stand by.  Guy gets knocked out, white guy moves on to next one, and one of the friends even tries breaking it up.  But no, if there are 3 mexicans and a white guy, of course it's those thug ass chicos that are beating up that white guy!!!  There are some highly voted comments agreeing with this sentiment but then:

I can promise if it was one mexican dude fighting three skinny white dudes there would be an uproar.

Now, let's consider the fact that the white dude almost kills a man who tries getting up after being knocked out.

This guy absolutely blows my mind.  It would appear he can't see the difference between a bar fight and a struggle for your own life.  Not only has the guy clearly won the 'fight', but once the two men he was fighting were subdued he could have easily walked away but instead *tries stomping on his fucking head*, which apparently is A OK and a logical and good idea...

So anyway [A thread on a popular gaming website](http://np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1bso84/misogyny_sexism_and_why_rps_isnt_shutting_up/) has rubbed people who don't want to read something like this the wrong way. 

The writer of the article disabled the comments section and then asked for the discussion to take place somewhere else 

Full text here: 
&gt;The comments are off on this post. This is a reference post, a place we can point people toward to understand our position. I am not willing to let this post become yet another platform for the people who wish to silence this debate. On this occasion I have no desire to publicly put up with the invasive ignorant spite and fearful anger that will be littered amongst the usual excellent comments from our fantastic readers. This is not an attempt to stifle discussion – RPS provides ample opportunity for it, and will continue to do so. If you want to communicate your thoughtful disagreement or unpleasant bile, my email address is at the top of this page, where your remarks will receive an audience of one. So please do use it. I will read and consider everything. (from the article itself) 

So with that here it goes

&gt;""Comments are closed.Of course they are
Rock, Paper, Shotgun will never back down on the subject of sexism and misogyny
Except if you want to discuss it, because anyone who doesn't agree have ""ignorant spite and fearful anger"" and so any futher discussion is off, my true is the only true. I remember when rock paper shotgun was a good site.""

He read the  block of the post that isn't cut off from the front page of the site.....top comment. Unexpected...but FURTHER DISCUSSION ISN'T ""OFF"". 

Granted people are pointing this out but there is a difference between upvotes and downrons.

The OP calls this top comment out and is downvoted a bit 

&gt;""Have you actually read the article? Here's the full ""ignorant spite"" quote IN CONTEXT :
I have no desire publicly put up with the invasive ignorant spite and fearful anger that will be littered amongst the usual excellent comments from our fantastic readers.
He doesn't want to put up with the trolls that will inevitably show up. If you want to discuss the matter, there's the forum, and there are other news, and there is reddit. By circlejerking like you are, you're adding nothing to the discussion.""

This is the crux of this CB post isn't it? 

But sadly its overshadowed by captain I know how to run a fucking website

&gt;""The article is belligerent, aggressive and accusatory. Closing the debate, regardless of the minority negative comments, only serves to create a platform for lectures.
This guy is pretty misguidedly attacking an entire community of people, many of whom likely have entirely different experiences to him and then cowardly retreating behind the closed comments rather than addressing the criticisms of his observations.
This is supposed to be a reputable outlet for gaming related news, this isn't the behavior of one.""

Don't be fooled because the article is none of these things. Rockpapershotgun is not ""creating a platform for lectures"" they just write about the gaming industry and pretty much everything about it. Hell a good part of the article is about a Machinima Prime youtube video that was even bashed on reddit as being horrible.

&gt;""Yes, lets discuss the sexism, oh wait, comments are closed. So I guess this is John Walker saying he knows best and everyone disagrees with him is wrong?
Classic sensationalist blogging piece that is as obnoxious as the people it criticizes. Best of RPS.""

Sensationalist blogging piece? This article is actually pointing out and discussing legitimate problems. At no point does he say whoever disagrees is wrong and once again, there are other places on the very same sight where you can voice your opinion.


&gt;""This is not journalism, it is spiteful pro-censorship cancer. Look at how casually he posts a character design with the implication that a woman in skimpy clothing is inherently sexist and the game should be banned. Personally I think it's pretty cool that a game features a huge muscular chick instead of a more conventional supermodel bodytype. But I guess it's ""sexist"" because some foul mindless shithead got worked up after listening to a speech by a criminal grifter.
What was wrong with having a website about indie and PC games? Why does this kind of filthy idiotic person feel the need to infest every platform?""

Ok ok I know that comment is kind of Social Justice-y but I want to point out how incredibly wrong he is 

&gt;""""What was wrong with having a website about indie and PC games? Why does this kind of filthy idiotic person feel the need to infest every platform?""
Uh. You do realize that the piece's author, John Walker, is a founding member of Rock Paper Shotgun? He didn't ""infest"" the site, he's been there since day one.""

That. and the fact that this isn't some ""pro-censorship"" article. This is just reinforcing the notion that no one is actually reading the article that comments like this.

I'm not really sure how to end this because the comments in the young thread itself are trying their darndest to fight this kind of idea. 

Maybe schools need to teach reading comprehension better or perhaps encourage reading at all? I don't know. Maybe this kind of article and the comments section being closed just angers people a little too much. What do you fellas think?


Well shit it got even better.

&gt;This bugs me. I agree with everything this article says, I'm just as angry at the game industry as the author of this article is. But still, that second quote bugs the crap out of me. He talks about fostering discussion, but then claims that every dissenting perspective is 'an attempt to silence discussion.' We've talked about how great it is that we're seriously discussing this issue, but then gotten angry when people who don't already agree with us join the discussion.
It's this bizarre them vs us mentality. Character designers who enjoy oversexualization, assholes perpetuating stereotypes, and employers who hold women to higher standards aren't just people who we need to convince to change their ways, they're the enemy. They're people who are wrong and we need to do something about them, rather than their opinions, outlooks or actions. This argument isn't ""we try to convince/educate the industry,"" it's ""we're fighting the industry."" It's not ""Women try to get rid of damaging tropes in the media"" It's ""Tropes vs Women""- though more often framed as ""Writers vs Women""
Besides that, this article falls for the usual problem that a lot of recent discussions on this subject have- it doesn't add anything. It reminds us that sexism exists, throws a few insults at the perceived perpetrators, and then just sorta... rants. There's no attempt to win over the hostile audience it acknowledges exists, in fact it just sorta yells at that audience. Were it not for that pastebin deflection, I would be tempted to call it linkbait, simply because it isn't actually adding anything to the conversation besides a bit more of that nice, alienating outrage.
It's not persuasive, it's not constructive, and now it's not even linkbait. It's someone being mad on the internet.
Edit; I acknowledge that the article also calls out this sort of response- according to them claiming that both sides are guilty of hyperbole doesn't add anything. I don't find that claim agreeable, because when we abuse hyperbole and demonize the other side, we alienate the very people we're supposed to be trying to persuade. I invite anyone to please explain to me how asserting that the detractor's opinions don't matter is likely to win them over.

It doesn't add anything? Maybe to you? I think its an insult to dismiss this entire article as just someone being mad on the internet. Once again the whole not reading thing but at least they're trying to discuss something.

&gt;It's bad. Well, that was easy. I should be a writer. Sexism and Misogyny.. It's no more rampant among internet communities than any other troll baiting topic.. I mean.. if you want real sexism look at the middle east or watch Mad Men.
Some neckbeard saying ""LOL NO GURLS ON THE INTERNET"" shouldn't be taken seriously by anyone. You know, maybe that's why bullying is so seemingly dangerous these days.. Everyone let's every god damned comment by some jackass ruin their day.
I couldn't even finish that pretentious article. ""If you don't think it's as bad as I'm saying then YOU DON'T CARE!""

This is just...what? lol no gurls on the internet?....That isn't even in the...

He also mentions how HE should be a writer as if that's ALL RPS writes about. I know this is a bit off topic considering the title of this post but I mean come on, that just isn't even correct in any universe.

Amazingly, and in the face of the normal lump of coal you would see in the /r/politics, the lemmings became angry and turned the tide against the article!

&gt; I call bullshit on this article. Her children don't lose their eligibility! If she has 2 kids and $0 income, her normal food stamp allotment would be $526. With herself being excluded as an ineligible drug felon, she would still receive $367 for the kids. Is that enough to feel 3 people for a month? Maybe not, but at least the kids can still get the benefits.

&gt; People are ineligible members all the time. Illegal immigrants whose children receive food stamps, college students living with parents where the college student doesn't get stamps but the rest of the family does, and assistance groups with drug felons! You see it all the time. Maybe it's the mom, maybe it's a boyfriend, maybe boyfriend/girlfriend live together and one of them is a drug felon.

&gt; It only exempts the drug felon as an individual. That is all. All other family members remain eligible.

More and more candy cane authorities weigh in on the incorrect article and become the top thread!  Huzzah for humanity!

&gt; Florida Food Stamp worker here. This is correct. And it's not that she's ineligible because she used drugs, but because she ""trafficked"" drugs.

&gt; WV food stamp caseworker here. Came to say this. The kids are absolutely eligible. Her saying that she's in prostitution to feed them, is flat out incorrect and just another excuse to allow herself to fall back into old habits.

All the above posts are on the nice list! Which makes it slightly suspicious that the post in question has over 2,000 net upcanes and is on the frontpage, you know, since the article is inaccurate and the commentors have pointed that out.

Maybe I’m just pissed off tonight for some reason. Maybe these people are right.

http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/w97jr/911_victims_son_owns_bill_oreilly/

First of all, the video is from an anti-Fox News documentary called ""Outfoxed"". Naturally, this is going to be one of the worst examples of O'Reilly.

Second, it's common fucking knowledge that Bill O'Reilly is an extremely blunt, to-the-point, and aggressive talker. *Everyone* knows that. I don't know what this guy expected when he came on the show. His position, no matter how you feel about it, WAS a very far-left position. And O'Reilly is far right. Again, what the hell is the guy doing arguing with Bill fucking O'Reilly and then complaining that he was treated unfairly?

Third, the title of the post is clearly manipulative. They had an argument, but no one ""owned"" anyone else. If you're a hardcore liberal, Glick owned O'Reilly. If you're a hardcore conservative, O'Reilly owned Glick. Neither of them made any ground on their position, and chances are no viewers' positions were drastically changed either. 

The hivemind surrounding Fox News and Bill O'Reilly is simply absurd. There are people who legitimately believe that Fox News is evil, malicious, and out to hurt Americans.

(The thread has now actually been nuked because of vote-brigading. Lol.) This thread was full of ""whoa we actually have content in this subreddit"". I liken it to people who have been taken away from civilisation toiling away in a dark, forgotten cave for the first time in seven years seeing the sun. So naturally this sparks a ""guide to"" trend in /r/music - all marked by their novelistic tendencies and links to youtube songs. The ideal platform for introducing to the nearly 3 million subscribers of that subreddit to someone they may not have given a proper chance (like Lil Wayne). 

Lol nope [DAE Gorillaz?](http://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hmy92/guide_to_gorillaz/) Put aside the fact that Gorillaz only has 4 albums and an EP, it's still hard to see the necessity of this post given the fact that it is well known that Gorillaz are one of the more venerated bands on the subreddit.

Same with [Radiohead](http://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hncpt/guide_to_radiohead/) (which manages to sneak in [this image](http://i.imgur.com/VgUgW.jpg) and takes it completely and utterly seriously), [Daft Punk](http://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hodnl/guide_to_daft_punk/), [Modest Mouse](http://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hlsgc/guide_to_modest_mouse/) (although it is refreshing to see *anything* that isn't Float On mentioned) [The Killers](http://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hmpnx/guide_to_the_killers/), and [Muse](http://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hmz4w/guide_to_muse/). The band with the most daunting discography there is Radiohead - but it's hard to think of people on /r/music who would particularly need such a guide. 

There are a couple of good ones, for example this attempt to distil the [gargantuan discography of Frank Zappa](http://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hoc38/guide_to_frank_zappa/) into something manageable, and this [guide to Rush](http://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1ho4la/guide_to_rush_this_ones_gonna_be_long/) is on the way to doing the same - even though Rush are very much circlejerked over on Reddit in general, they do have a massive discography that probably at some point or another requires a simple ""Guide To"". Otherwise there is an unfulfilled request for a guide to [Mozart](http://np.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1hms2d/request_guide_to_mozart/) and precious little else.

Let's look at the other side of the coin on r/hiphopheads: you have [this guide to MF DOOM](http://np.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1hndly/guide_to_mf_doom/) who, while a popular subject of circlejerkery still has a massive amount of output under various pseudonyms that needs some explanation, [a guide to Jay-Z](http://np.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1hnz36/you_crazy_for_this_one_guide_to_jayz/) that redeems its relative lack of necessity with some #rare earlier songs he appeared on, and hey it's topical. 

So all in all, in reply to a challenge from /r/hiphopheads to broaden their horizons (the Lil Wayne post arose from the very common observation that he is a rapper of very very little worth), the denizens of /r/music instead waxed lyrical about their very established favourite bands and it seems that little was learned in the process.

As many of us have seen before, the inevitable jerk ensues.  

Lets start with the latter.  It is interesting to note that many of the problems addressed in this thread are highly prevalent in reddit itself

&gt; The human propensity to divide everyone into ""us"" and ""them.""

(Atheists - thesis, men -woman,middle class suburban whites - everyone else) 

&gt; We all generalize too much.

(This is in the same vein as above.  ""All Christians do this...All Gypsies are this...All handicapped people should be...)

Below this are predicable comments dealing with obesity, overpopulation, and the brainwashing of Americans.

I would like to shift focus to the former, and perhaps jerkier thread of the most ""offensive"" opinions.  We have all seen this before.  ""Offensive"" is merely a guise for redditors so state an opinion and receive self assurance from like minded redditors whether the belief is true or merely made up to get karma.  

At the top with 2600 points is: 

&gt; That joining the army doesn't automatically make you a hero. I respect those guys, but not all of them earned hero status.

An honest opinion and not too scathing or controversial, but as an American, I always got the impression that we were supporting the troops rather than making them heroes.  You may buy a soldier a meal at McDonald's, but you wouldn't get his autograph.  

Further down we see a familiar comment about children with disabilities sitting at 1505 points 

&gt; I believe that if you are pregnant and find out the child would be born with a severe case of mental redardation or other disease that causes them to never be independent and always needing someone to take care of their every need, the parents should abort

[Ok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christy_Brown)

Oh boy and this one: 

&gt; People should have to pass a test and get a license before they vote or breed.

Don't people already have to take tests to get licences?  And if I want to have kids, do I have to know College Algebra or Western Literature?  Please enlighten me.

No, no, reddit didn't forget about Gypsies 

&gt; I'm tolerant of all races and lifestyles except gypsies. I fucking hate gypsies.

This sits at 1345.  No need to think about the hundreds of years of oppression, mass murder and segregation forced upon the Roma that lead to their current economic condition/lack of education.  Let's just say we hate them.

Now in the wake of the whole Chris Dorner situation, Reddit has spared no time in continuing the giant anti-cop sentiment that its always had. The jerk against the LAPD has been already documented on [this](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/185onn/the_lapd_le_golden_gem_of_a_righteous_warrior/) [sub](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/183kmb/redditors_smugly_congratulate_themselves_for/). But if Reddit likes one thing, its beating a concept into the ground. [So I present to you episode 3 in the LAPD hate saga](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1875mn/im_just_going_to_say_it_shooting_at_those_ladies/).

In a rare, front page self post on /r/politics , Reddit continues their teenage vendettas against the cops by siding with the cop murderer. We'll start with the title
&gt;I'm just going to say it: Shooting at those ladies in that truck makes me suspect that the LA police wan't to silence Chris Dorner for sone reason or another.

I KNOW I'LL GET DOWNVOTED BUT DAE AGREE WITH THE MURDERER???

Ignoring the obvious grammar malfunction (which he corrects in the description), we see that this Redditor can't wait to wave his extreme bravery boner to everyone about how he takes a brave stance against the LAPD and sides with Dorner. Lets look at the [top rated comment](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1875mn/im_just_going_to_say_it_shooting_at_those_ladies/c8c8dyl)
&gt;I tend to be pro-police and pro-military, but even I think LAPD is acting very guilty. Vigilante vs. due process. Even if they're afraid he'll open fire right away, they could have noticed wrong color, 2 people, etc. And they did it twice. ""Kill him before he talks.""

We see he uses the old reddit trick of ""I'm usually not part of the circlejerk group but today I am"" to gain karma and make his post sound reasonable. Its has nothing about how this man is obviously a murderer on the loose in one of the most population dense areas of the country, no, Reddit only cares that their action movie hero is trying to expose the evil of le LAPD. Let's go a [couple replies down](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1875mn/im_just_going_to_say_it_shooting_at_those_ladies/c8cc0aa)
&gt;You're a fool if you still have the childish belief that all police officers are good, the truth is it's a position of power that attracts far more power hungry douchbags than honarable people and always will.

Here we see the ol' ""I'm smarter than you because I have the exact opposite viewpoint of a child"" contrarianism that Reddit thrives off of. [Next reply](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1875mn/im_just_going_to_say_it_shooting_at_those_ladies/c8ccobh)
&gt;Even the ""good"" ones do nothing about excessive force and corruption. They just turn a blind eye due to the ""code"". They might be good people, but as police they're complicit enablers of injustice. Fuck 'em. Dorner's a violent loon and is not to be commended, but due to his actions there will likely be investigations into his complaints, something that wouldn't happen otherwise. So i guess that's the silver lining of this tragedy.

Same basic point as the comment its replying to, all cops suck and this is Reddits long awaited for hero to show the world their villany. Lets look at the [next top rated reply to the top one](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1875mn/im_just_going_to_say_it_shooting_at_those_ladies/c8cav0j)
&gt;This.
TL;DR: The LAPD is acting like a gang.
Their explanation was that a lookout car radioed a suspicious looking vehicle that matched the description of Dorner's was moving towards them. The cops saw the truck slow down several times and it did not have its headlights on.
Protip: It was slowing down to throw a newspaper to the door.
A number of officers on a protective detail (unnamed individual from Dorner's manifesto) opened fire on the truck. You can see in the picture, a lot of those were fired from behind the truck.
ಠ_ಠ
How on earth does this not look like an attempt to gun down Dorner?
I get it. He's allegedly murdered 3 people (2 civies and a cop) and injured another (also a cop) but opening fire on a truck like that? Gangs do that. Not cops.

Reddit believes that ALL cops are gangs and he uses as many memes as he can to prove his point. [Several](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1875mn/im_just_going_to_say_it_shooting_at_those_ladies/c8cbjfw) [people](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1875mn/im_just_going_to_say_it_shooting_at_those_ladies/c8cb8ka) [go](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1875mn/im_just_going_to_say_it_shooting_at_those_ladies/c8cb6pp) [on](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1875mn/im_just_going_to_say_it_shooting_at_those_ladies/c8ce4n8) [to](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1875mn/im_just_going_to_say_it_shooting_at_those_ladies/c8cbkxc) agree with him.

Reddit then goes on in several post to point out that the bad guy is right because they're le intellectual contrarians who see that the bad guy is always right. Most notably [this one](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1875mn/im_just_going_to_say_it_shooting_at_those_ladies/c8c9axe)
&gt;how wrong would it be, if i was cheering for the guy? and don´t worry mr. fbi agent reading this, i am speaking hypothetically of course....

Same schtick of fake reluctance to agree with the circlejerk to make it seem more reasonable. But Reddit goes on [and](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1875mn/im_just_going_to_say_it_shooting_at_those_ladies/c8c9lyx) [agrees](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1875mn/im_just_going_to_say_it_shooting_at_those_ladies/c8ca0st)

Now there are reasonable posts disagreeing with the circlejerk that are sitting in the orange, but almost every top post in this thread is patting this guy on the back for his vigilante justice and sticking a middle finger up to those cops. It just bugs me that the same people saying that the power of being a cop corrupts responsible people are the same people against gun control.

Sorry if that includes posts that have already been posted here, but hopefully I can make up for it by being more comprehensive.

Because reddit cannot go for very long without a new cause or boycott to jump onto, and similarly cannot survive without a rich person to despise and demagogue against, they have turned their sights from their vanquished rival, Sir Mittler Ayn Rand Romney, and towards another heartless capitalist who *dares* to make a business decision that makes their Conquering God-King look bad. 

I first saw the story in /r/conservative (granted, the context was more ""look guys, job-creators are no longer job creating because of Obamacare! O the humanity!"" But it didn't take much detective work to figure out that things originated in /r/politics.

[**First major posting that caught my eye.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12xx15/papa_johns_ceo_john_schnatter_says_company_will/) Pretty unbiased headline so I can't really be annoyed by that. Comments are as to be expected: [Time for a boycott, boys! I shall get my Doritos and mozzarella sticks elsewhere, thankyouverymuch!](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12xx15/papa_johns_ceo_john_schnatter_says_company_will/c6z25a8). Yeah, whatever, nothing special.

[LET'S START CRUNCHING NUMBERS GUISE!](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12xx15/papa_johns_ceo_john_schnatter_says_company_will/c6z2mr9) Because we totally have complete knowledge of Papa John's overhead and how to run a major business.

[**Not even done in /r/politics yet.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12yqjm/papa_johns_says_theyll_increase_the_cost_of_pizza/) Again, more financial wizards who wonder aloud, ""why doesn't a company orient itself around my personal political ideology that disregards the need to provide goods and services for customers at a profit.

[**I'll finish off /r/politics with some good ole fashioned denial.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12ytnn/lets_be_clear_nobody_is_getting_laid_off_due_to/) ""B-b-but, nothing Obama does could ever have a bad impact on the economy! Its just a corporate conspiracy to make him look bad."" Nope, no businessman could ever cut jobs when faced with higher taxes or more regulation, as long as the magical *demand fairy* provides it with unlimited jobs! (Just look at today's [brave coal miner AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12wyyn/yesterday_i_was_laid_off_because_president_obama/) as another example of this mindset.)

Okay, so that's no surprise that /r/politics has got its talking points for the week already. But wait! Its leaked to other places as well! [**Moar brave boycotts**](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/12yxq7/i_still_refuse_to_watch_jay_leno_after_the/c6zba9y). Or does it still count as a boycott if you never used it anyway? ""How dare businessmen react to unprecedented government regulations in a negative way! They must not be working *hard enough*! EVIL REPUBLICANS""

It finally became clear to me that this thing had reached angry-mob proportions when they showed [**[le]terally ^this!**](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12zmz0/papa_johns_house/). Just a picture of Papa John's mansion without context, because by now of course, everyone on reddit knows we're supposed to hate this guy.

Why, if I were a CEO, I'd live in a shack.

So there's my shpeal. Haven't posted here in a while, almost forgot the satisfaction of spending 20 minutes ranting on the internet about stuff.

In [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/x5vnu/hugo_chávez_tells_venezuelans_to_drink_juice_not/) we have something very similar to Penn's situation, the main topic being how Chavez is telling his people to drink nationalized juice and not Coca-Cola.

I think when this thread was initially made there were a lot more pro-Chavez posts.  However, the top two posts still shit on Coca-Cola, corporations, praise Chavez with typical ""well, this is just logical""-type points. I'm not even necessarily against this idea of cutting out soda in one's diet, but by this point, I was a little confused as to why this was actually news.  This post was approximately three comments down just an hour ago, [some guy railing about how awesome the Venezuela economy is](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/x5vnu/hugo_chávez_tells_venezuelans_to_drink_juice_not/c5jlytw), and how Chavez fixed everything.  Check that thread to see a lot of Venezuelans call them out on this.

This now-third comment really struck me, as they are [taking on the hivemind directly about the country they have lived in for many years](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/x5vnu/hugo_chávez_tells_venezuelans_to_drink_juice_not/c5jlmbm).  It's what got me interested in making this post, because it sums up a lot of the pseudo-intellectualism I've seen on this site:

&gt; [...] It surprises me that given the level of informed people I see on reddit everyday on many subjects, there are still people who believe in Hugo Chavez and his government. Although, the suggestion of stop drinking coke but a national product instead it's not a bad idea, you have to see what he has done in the past 14 years to the national production of goods. As of today, Venezuela is importing the majority of basic products from food to personal hygiene.

Top comment? Easy pickings.

&gt; It's pretty fucking awesome. I'm 41, almost 42, and as a woman I can say I have never, ever regretted my decision.
We have so much more freedom than our counterparts with children. I sleep in on Saturdays just because I want to. I used to hear, ""You'll change your mind"" when I was in my twenties. Now I hear, ""You're so smart"" from mothers now that I'm in my forties.

Yep, feel the praise from your inferior peers. Let them go on about how *smart* you were.

She goes on, and come on guys, you can't make this stuff up:

&gt; Best financial and personal decision we've ever made. I have zero regrets and only happiness and pride that I knew myself well enough to make a decision that was great for me. If you also don't want children ever, visit /r/childfree[1] for conversations with kindred spirits.

She RECOMMENDS /r/childfree. Damn, I never thought I'd see the day. Somewhere in the midst though, sentient life appears

&gt;Oh god. Being childless works for my life, because of work and health situations, and I'm not sorry, but please don't ask shit like this and give the gaping assholes who populate /r/childfree validation of any kind.

Sense, ladies and gentlemen. Don't worry though, the fun's just started. Listen to the first reply:

&gt; Have you noticed how many people with children in this thread have chosen to respond to the proudly childfree with accusations of immaturity, selfishness, or other put-downs?

LITERALLY OPPRESSED. ""PROUDLY CHILDFREE""

It's getting good. And that's when I noticed a pattern. Listen to this comment:

&gt;Best. Thing. Ever.
SO and I are in a constant honeymoon.
We can have sex anywhere in the house at anytime, and have money and time and freedom to travel and have sex there- anytime, anhwhere.

Guise, look at all the sex we're having. Guise look.

&gt;I'm 32. I had a vasectomy at 27. Never had kids, refused to put any sperm on ice.
Best decision I ever made. I have disposable income, freedom, peace of mind...and NEVER have to indirectly annoy my Facebook friends with pictures of kids that honestly look no different than what everyone else shits out.
My SOLE regret is that I had the vasectomy done during the opening weekend of ""Iron Man"" and thus didn't get to see it in the theater with my friends.

Kids are sooooooooo inconvenient, amirite?

&gt;This is a bit reassuring as a 20 something who doesn't think they want kids but everyone keeps telling me I'll want them. My sister can have kids and I'll play with them on the weekends. I want sportscars, women and booze.

Totally admirable. Such impeccable maturity.

&gt;Married, 30+, no kids, didn't try, don't want to try, wife agrees kids are Dream Destroyers. And it also so happens we have money to do things now and then.

Dream Destroyers^TM. I rest my case.

There seems to be a pattern emerging, hm? There are a few other comments from people who don't want kids because they can't take care of them. That is probably a better reason that what these guys are coming up with. It all points back to reddit's leaning towards selfishness, not wanting to care for another person, because fuck other people, I want bitches. Average age for a respondent is mid-twenties/early thirties, nowhere near old enough to really say that they've had no regrets. 

They're afraid. They are afraid of raising a kid and messing up, afraid of having a kid at all and losing the carefree life they were used to. They are afraid to love something more than themselves.

I have a problem with being succinct sometimes. I realize there are a lot of Boston marathon write-ups here and perhaps we don't need any more, but I can't help but marvel at the people who think reddit's participation in finding the bombers was actually beneficial. For some of us, the Boston update threads were literally the pinnacle of journalism, while for others, it was just a race to the bottom to see who could report every unnecessary and miniscule detail as fast as possible. This last week has led to the creation of some of the more embarrassing subreddits like /r/findbostonbombers (which was thankfully shut down), which were dedicated to ~~falsely implicating any brown person who looked suspicious~~ finding the perpetrators of the Boston marathon bombings. Other subreddits, like /r/ScannerPorn cropped up to feed redditor's need to feel like Spiderman or something along those lines, I don't know.

The reason for this post, though, is to point out something which I have noticed several times in the past week, which is the blatant use of the [tu quoque fallacy](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque) in order to dismiss CNN and various news outlets' claim that reddit dun goofed. Apparently, if you make a mistake, you can't blame other people for making the same mistake. Except, of course, if you're reddit, in which case you can blame anyone you want because ""reddit is just a collective of people"", which is true, but they are users unified under one website and largely share the same views. You would think these people would have more tact than to avoid accusations by shifting the blame to others, but it seems like such maturity is beyond your average default subreddit commenter.

A good example of the use of logical fallacies to dodge accusations comes in [this thread](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1csxi6/cnn_reporter_states_reddit_not_a_reliable_news/) about CNN calling reddit ""an unreliable news source"". The brave OP chimes in with some of the most insightful commentary I've seen all week:

&gt;So watching CNN this morning, show called ""reliable sources"". Other commentators on the same show stated that twitter and reddit were FASTER sources of news than the news channels. Lauren Ashburn claims that a reporter listening to a police scanned cannot accurately report the news. Well guess what? Me (and thousands of others) turned to reddit, got reporting from people listening to police scanners, and therefore knew LONG before CNN reported that he was in a boat and knew BEFORE cnn reported that he was captured. So... who's a better news source? The people listening to the scanners... or the CNN reporters blocks away? REDDIT WINS EVERY TIME!

Reddit wins every time, indeed. I feel the marvelous closer to this thread will go down in circlejerking lore for years to come. I really don't know where to start, it's like everything here is just wrong for every single reason. I guess it doesn't matter if you have to fact check or make sure that what you're saying is actually verifiable, as long as you're the first one on the scene with the musings of the police on the scanner, that's better journalism than what CNN or other news outlets do. Why wait for the truth when you can just get hearsay and speculation much quicker? 

While the comments do a good job of pointing out that reddit indeed messed up, I feel like not many people addressed the crux of this argument, which is that the reason why CNN and other news outlets are more respectable than a bunch of wannabe Spidermans is that CNN's journalistic integrity is on the line if they mess up. With reddit, you can shift the blame to someone else, always! Do something great? We did it reddit! Do something bad? Well, we're not all the same person, you know?

In [this thread](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1csy2x/cnn_partially_blames_reddit_for_boston_bombing/), we have more of the same, with one of the top comments employing the exact same fallacy as before:

&gt;You mean you're not supposed to take the information you find and instantly release it without checking it? Is that the lesson you'd like us to learn, CNN? That it's irresponsible to release information without verifying it?

&gt;Do as they say, not as they do.

Yeah, because as we learned from the Aurora shooting and the Dorner case, reddit is certainly on top of the facts and surely doesn't upvote false information without checking it, first. Karma takes a backseat to integrity, right? Right, guys? Guys?

Another comment comes up [here](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1csy2x/cnn_partially_blames_reddit_for_boston_bombing/c9jqs3k) that I feel tries to shift the blame away from reddit by claiming it's not a news outlet, despite the fact people were acting like it was all over the place when the update threads were going on.

&gt; I was watching Jon Stewart's appearance on Crossfire and they were talking about the difference between Comedy Central and CNN. Stewart noted that there is a degree of responsibility that exists for CNN but not Comedy Central.

&gt;I think that goes for Reddit as well. Reddit is not morally responsible to be right. CNN has the moral responsibility of sound journalism to be a reputable source of facts. So to hold Reddit to the same standards as a national media network such as CNN would be irresponsible at best.

I feel like if you want to act like a journalist/detective/FBI agent/whatever, you should be held accountable if you mess up. The fact those update threads were filled with tons of speculation and downright false information makes it hard for me to take this site seriously. The mentality seems to be ""I'll just post whatever I hear and redact it if it's proven wrong"". I don't understand how CNN is morally responsible to provide facts and yet reddit isn't. If you want to act like you're post-traditional media, you're going to have to have those standards. You can't just be a slanderous and libelous person and then claim immunity later.

In closing, I feel bad for the subscribers of /r/boston and all of the unnecessary attention their subreddit got as a result of this tragedy. I can sympathize with them real well, being a Los Angeles resident, I experienced some of the same things when Dorner was still a thing and /r/DornerCase was a bastion of logic and facts. I only hope that news outlets continue to call out reddit for their role in the spread of misinformation. It needs to be known that this site is unreliable when it comes to news reporting and making a play-by-play of every minute and worthless detail is not worthy of a Peabody Award or any kind of prize. It's not journalism, it's not how news should work. I honestly am fed up with people praising this site every time they mess up because they're too sheltered to realize what journalism is. I can only hope these armchair detectives and pretend FBI agents learn from their mistakes and never do anything like this again. They had a large role in potentially ruining two people's lives: Sunil and Mike. If anything, they deserve an apology, not redditors patting themselves on the back for a job well done.

Pretty much speaks for itself, but unfortunately it isn't Friday, so I have to pad this out with some filler text. 

In this video (which has since been taken down), we see a blonde girl yelling at another girl for a while and then pushing her, which results in the quiet girl beating the loud one into a pulp. The audio is almost impossible to understand, so that's all the context we have. The response? 
&gt;[The blonde girl is guilty but so is everyone else that didn't try to stop the fight.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/18r5ul/girl_learns_a_lesson_in_this_is_why_you_dont_fuck/c8h97sn)

No mention of the other girl who snapped and beat the shit out of someone, because of course she was doing the right thing. There are a ton of people who seem to think that she was not in any way at fault, which makes absolutely no sense. For example:
&gt;[dam.. Blondie got the crap beat out of her. And i bet the brunette would get in just as much trouble because schools are stupid.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/18r5ul/girl_learns_a_lesson_in_this_is_why_you_dont_fuck/c8h8elm)

Wait just a second. The blonde got beaten up and it's stupid that the *brunette* is going  to get in trouble?  
I think Reddit loves jumping to conclusions. This video is set up in the same format that a lot of these ""bully beatdown"" videos are, so that means that whoever we saw being obnoxious at the beginning is a horrible person who deserves to get shut down. Violently.  
That's another thing that really disturbs me about this thread. It really feels like people are borderline getting off at watching this girl get her head caved in. Case in point:
&gt;[I hadn't been this pumped up since 300](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/18r5ul/girl_learns_a_lesson_in_this_is_why_you_dont_fuck/c8h92i6)

There are also a ton of people making UFC comments, which is a little disturbing because of how detached it is from reality. This is a complex situation with emotions and all that stuff, not a fight between two professionals. I don't know if any of you remember that video of a drunk college kid getting cold-cocked and mugged a while ago, but I'm pretty sure no one said
&gt;[POW! Right in the kisser!](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/18r5ul/girl_learns_a_lesson_in_this_is_why_you_dont_fuck/c8h8xag)

in *that* thread. (If I recall correctly, it was actually just 90% racism.)
Regardless, the ""worst offender"" award for being sickeningly callous goes to this lovely comment responding to ""blondie was still punching at the end. If you're gonna start a fight, you might as well finish it"":

&gt;[Pretty sure that was her death throes as whatever remaining brain cells die from her face being smashed in...](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/18r5ul/girl_learns_a_lesson_in_this_is_why_you_dont_fuck/c8h92go)

 I think that's enough text to be at least marginally above ""low effort"", so for a conclusion, let me leave you with this ""le gem"":
&gt;[So many comments saying this was sad or that fighting is useless. No.  
Thousand times no. I hate that mentality. I hate that everything must be solved with words and that if you stoop to someone's level than no one wins. That's bullshit Reddit. That's what liberal arts students think. That's not how the world works.  
Regardless of who started this fight, you could tell that words would not solve the situation. One person was clearly agitated enough to come to blows and the other dealt with the situation. Talking here would have gotten the girl in the red a fat lip. It would have reinforced the instigator's mentality that she can do what she wants if the girl in red does not fight back. That's a horrible lesson to teach both girls in this video.  
The only thing I think is sad about this is that they broke it up after the blond girl was on her back. Let her get her jaw broken and lose a few teeth, maybe then you won't try to sucker punch people sitting down like a punk bitch.

Here we have a shit ton of redditors saying this isn't racist. Based on reading the comments, it appears that the reasoning why this isn't racist is because it's based off of a black Japanese celebrity named [Bobby Ologun (google images search)](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=bobby+ologun&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bpcl=35466521&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=775&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=RbuOUKfLC-bW0gH68YH4AQ). Not quite sure how they came to this conclusion considering the text on the mask is in Japanese and Korean, and that even if you knew these languages, the glare on the text and the non-close picture makes it hard to read. Based on, you know, basic advertising and common sense, you'd think his name or his picture would be on the package if it was based off of him.

Not sure how to stick this guy's link into that quote, but he linked to the wikipedia article of Bobby Ologun where it says ""confirming:"". Great proof. In reddit's mind linking to that, totally confirms that the mask is based on him. I still fucking can't get over how they're believing this without any proof. Apparently linking to a wikipedia article proves it though. Awesome.

&gt;[That's mega racist? I'd say KKK lynchings were ""mega racist"". That mask is barely racist, more ignorant, and given that the mask is actually some guy's face I'd say it makes you the ignorant one.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/127upi/my_wife_found_this_megaracist_mask_in_a_seoul/c6sy14e)

OP is obviously the ignorant one here. If you look at Bobby's face compared to the mask, the mask's lips are, you know, three times as big as his lips. Let's say I'm being stupid here. It is proven that the mask is based on Bobby. It's still fucking racist because of the exaggerated stereotypical features. 

*I think I can stop repeating myself here. I could link to the 50 other comments claiming that because it's apparently based on Bobby it's not racist. But let's move on to my favorite part of this whole circlejerk.*

-----------------------------------------------------------------

* **It's not racist, stupid Americans are just too sensitive.**

&gt;[Americans are so sensitive I'm surprised they just don't hold each other and cry all day long. Grow a pair.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/127upi/my_wife_found_this_megaracist_mask_in_a_seoul/c6sx2hj)

According to the master race of non-americans, and also the americans who form all their opinions based on what the hivemind thinks, america just can't handle this and it's not actually racist. Americans apparently just overreact to every thing. 

&gt;[""Why doesn't every country respect American racial sensibilities!? Don't they understand that this is wrong in America! How dare they not share our culture!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/127upi/my_wife_found_this_megaracist_mask_in_a_seoul/c6szvvn)

Apparently racism isn't a problem any where else besides America, because every other country is smart enough to ignore blatantly racist things. 

&gt;[The style that the mask is made in is reminiscent of blackface - an aspect of minstrel shows in the early 1900s that exaggerated black peoples' features in a negative manner and typically portrayed them in a racist, derogatory light. Minstrel shows have a history of intense racism behind them, so a mask that borrows the style of blackface from a minstrel show can arguably be interpreted as racist.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/127upi/my_wife_found_this_megaracist_mask_in_a_seoul/c6syt82)

Here's the reply:

&gt;[Yes, but this is found in Seoul. A ordinary korean person would have no idea about what the heck a minstrel show is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/127upi/my_wife_found_this_megaracist_mask_in_a_seoul/c6sz9mq)

It's not Korea's fault that they're racist, it was a simply misunderstanding. They can't be racist since they've never seen a minstrel show. Because that's apparently the only way you can see blackface. Reddit seems to think Korea has no connection with the outside world or some thing? But apparently since there's no minstrel shows in Korea, they couldn't possibly know about black stereotypes and blackface. Must've be a complete coincidence that they depicted a black person with gigantic lips and bulging eyes, therefore they're not racist. Sigh.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

* **In fucking conclusion.**

Reddit, convinced that this mask is based on Bobby Ologun, a black celebrity, are certain that it's not racist and that it's just stupid americans being sensitive. Apparently Koreans are tougher than muricans, so it wouldn't be racist over there. 

I could go on. I could also mention reddit's thousands of extremely creepy comments toward OP's wife. But I'm getting sick of this thread and I'd use up all of my word count.

After my last segment of covering the takedown of /r/creepshots with some rather extreme methods, people followed through with their threats against Gawker.

I won't touch the actual event that much, everything has been said, just a reminder, /r/creepshot was so controversial that imgur.com removed. That's telling a story.

Why do redditors support a persona, that seems to have been constantly fapping to everything controversial? Well, let's hope we find out.


/r/mensrights banned [all gawker links while naming them all](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/11a7rk/the_follow_domains_will_no_longer_be_allowed_to/) (is there such a thing as bad publicity? According to /r/creepshots, no.) 

mensrights seems under the delusion, that the internet is place of complete anonymity and therefore your shitty actions in the web (which happen to affect real people) never ever are suppose to affect *your own* life.

It's an extremist viewpoint where everything on reddit seems to be allowed since reddit is soooo open and progressive and so. I wonder, why do we not have CP subs? If you have that spirit you should follow through it after all!

Let's take a look at what will bring you lots of karma:

&gt; Gawker is literally a cesspit of bad journalism even before these recent developments, this makes me happy!

Blatant swearing! Gawker gives them a little trollbait and the catch he makes is just outstanding.

&gt; [I applaud this move. Tabloid journalism and vigilantism have no place in our community or reddit as a whole. We will not tolerate witch hunts.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/11a7rk/the_follow_domains_will_no_longer_be_allowed_to/c6krosq)

But SRS has to go! *Picks up pitchfork* But pictures of sexulised minors and unaware women have a place in our community? I love the cherrypicking here.

The outcry swaps [over to Subredditdrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11a8jf/several_big_subreddits_are_banning_links_to/):

The best way to gain karma again is to swear at those Gawker sites:

Subredditdrama also [brigaded](http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/11bk8o/announcement_gawker_media_content_is_no_longer/c6l2ign) the /r/torchlight Gawker ban thread whilst claiming doing so only because SRS invades, [since some people weren't actually not so happy with the decision of the mods.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/11bk8o/announcement_gawker_media_content_is_no_longer/c6l0qyt)


/r/politics also banned Gawker in a bold action:

Le Human Husbandry 101

&gt;I think the world might be a better place if people stopped viewing it as the right to have children and viewed it as a privilege. My job brings me in to contact with poor parenting everyday. Some parents seem to have had children and then lost interest in actually bringing them up.

""Let me use my anecdotal STEM experience to tell you how to use your uterus.""

&gt;I heard an interesting speech on NPR yesterday. The speaker drew an analogy between people on Earth and bacteria in a test tube.

Humans. Bacteria. Do we honestly need to see what the analogy was? At least it came from NPR!

Speaking of analogies, look what we get when a commentor suggests that denying public services to parents for their third+ children would be akin to punishing the child just for being born:

&gt;If a single-father with no other family is convicted of heinous murder, do you let him go free because ""it would punish the child""?
No, society still punishes the adult, but it takes what steps it can to prevent spill-over. Now, sometimes those steps--like putting the child into foster-care--are tragic, but the alternatives are usually as-bad-or-worse. The parents' own actions have created a shitty situation, and the question for society-at-large is how to find the least-bad outcome.
That's not even getting into the cases where the parent is simply being abusive in terms of shifting all negative outcomes onto the child, using them as a pawn or hostage. (""You wouldn't dare X, because if you do, I'll make sure my child feels the pain first, and you wouldn't hurt a child, now would you?"")

Heinous murder=fathering more children than I find socially optimal.

&gt;When society is configured so that children are a collective responsibility and everyone (by force of law) bears the burden of providing the welfare for all... Then society will HAVE to ultimately dictate permissible procreation practices in order to flourish. The number of matters that can be kept private or decided by the will of a single person will shrink and shrink when allocation of ""public"" resources is constantly at stake.

""I'm adovacting for government run population control, but I'll do it using fancy words so it sounds like this John Locke essay I read in high school.""

There's plenty of dissent in this thread but not much discomfort with the notion that *how many children you choose to have* is somehow not an inalienable right. It's symptomatic of a common theme in Reddit's ""liberal"" hivemind: 

""There should be some kind of intelligence test to vote/breed/etc., but of course *I* would pass it.""

Try to say you can't actually get arrested for this sort of thing, and you get buried in down votes by people telling you that an airline will make you move seats which is *literally the same thing as being arrested on the spot*

Not only that, but apparently only one person has to complain and you [immediately lose your children for days](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/yei5q/as_a_single_dad_whenever_im_in_public_and_have_to/c5uzsg9)

Here is OP answering the question ""You can get arrested for that?""

&gt; Depends on whether or not an overly-sensitive parent sees you take them in or not. Some (usually women) flip out when they see a man take a child into a restroom, accusing them of being a pedophile (similar to the recent articles about men not being allowed to sit next to children on flights).

Apparently the matter of arrest or not arrest depends on the presence of overly-sensitive parents.  Yep, that's all.  It's that simple!

I think what happened here is this, cough, adviceanimals thread spawned every idiot on reddit at one time.

&gt;I think I saw this happen before. A guy walked into a bathroom with a little boy and I asked myself the same thing lol.

&gt; This is the only thing that scares me about becoming a dad. I am sure if I have a boy I might be okay, but with a girl it is an honest gamble in today's society.

For people who don't want to read or don't know what's going on the Tor network is basically a ""second"" internet. Only certain websites can be accessed through a special browser, and supposedly it is completely anonymous. On this network there are special sites that do various things like sell drugs, illegal guns, and child (p)0rn0graphy. Which I will now call CP cause I don't feel like being a on watch list. Not all of the Tor network is bad, but to be honest I don't know many uses for it. Well the FBI just busted this network and closed down quite a few sites.

I am so glad the responses are totally supportive of the CP bust and Reddit is buying pizza for the FBI. 

MAJOR EDIT: fuck normal editing procedure this one is going to the top. Here is one of the top 5 comments, it wasn't there when I made the post:

&gt;People are missing the point here. They're disguising it as a ""protect the children"" thing, but it's not about that at all (though shutting down the CP sites was indeed a desired side effect of their plan). It's about limiting the public's ability to protect themselves from the government's spying.
Let's put it this way. If no CP sites, or otherwise illegal sites had gone down during this, everyone would be FURIOUS that the government would DARE infringe on their right to privacy. But because they're ""protecting the children"", suddenly many people are behind the FBI's actions.
They're tricking you into supporting them.
Edit: It's also about crashing Bitcoin. The government and banks are terrified of a currency that they cannot control. They want it dead, and they want it dead NOW.

This comment... I can't even deal with it right now. I fold. [link](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1joqr6/half_of_all_tor_sites_compromised_freedom_hosting/cbgur61)

&gt;Ah, the old ""free speech is good except for the kind I don't like."" I'm not calling the guy a saint. He obviously enabled it by turning a blind eye. But all he did was offer a hosting service with true privacy. It wasn't just CP either. FH hosted other big hidden services like TorMail.
&gt; Also, ""the biggest underground child pornography ring?"" It's a CP dump. It's not some organized group of rapists that go out and kidnap kids, rape them, and sell pictures/videos of it for money.

Now luckily lots of people are calling him out but this has upvotes at 70+ Edit now 180+ but there is a user calling him out. Still...

&gt;Really? Most things are illegal on TOr. But because you find one particularly ""icky"" security should be compromised? You people that think this way are so backwards.

At 5+ displaying his displeasure of his drugs and maymays being compromised. 

&gt;All I care about is the Silk Road. Target all the CP you want, but leave my crypto-anarchist black market alone. Dread Pirate, better get your shit together.

BUT THE DRUGS!

&gt;Call me conspiracionist but since the Snowden incident all this seems like some sort of information war. I don't give two shits about CP, drug dealers and/or buttcoins.
What matters to me is that the internet keeps me and the information free and these days I guess that dream is dead. We are all under surveilance.

Some wackjob at +11

&gt;How in the hell do the FBI get it into their heads that they have the authority to just go around the world and arrest people at will. This happened with Kim Dotcom (even freezing bank accounts across the world) and now ""extending their jurisdiction"" to Ireland. Just incredible...

I don't even..

To be fair the second highest comment is this 

&gt;""Predominately targeting Freedom Hosting."" Freedom Hosting has the biggest underground child pornography ring, known as ""Lolita City"". Freedom Hosting are a bunch of skum bags who support child pornography. I'm actually behind the FBI on this one.

1372881926.0,83,self.circlebroke,1hl78p,r/AdviceAnimals' gamers all share one image of a non-gamer,smogless_sunset,114,31,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1hl78p/radviceanimals_gamers_all_share_one_image_of_a/,"In the early afternoons, I occasionally find myself browsing that most inane of subreddits, The Animals' Advice Korner. Today I spied a submission, healthy at +1600ish after 17 hours, entitled ""[To those who give me shit for playing video games at 25.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/)"" 

Now, aside from this not being a thing I've ever heard of happening (but who would expect anything other than invented persecutions from a hive so fond of jerking through the motions about ""friendzones,"" piracy, the second amendment and ""men's rights""?) I was fascinated to discover that redditors who feel persecuted for playing video games can only conceive of three characteristics that adult non-gamers share: 1) less money, 2) serious bar habits and 3) a fondness for worthless television.

For the sake of completeness, I'll acknowledge that the dominant jerk is that many gamers are older than 25. The vast majority of commenters felt the need to state their ages, humorously. It makes sense, but cumulatively, the effect is just a long list of redditors' ages, which is a silly and frivolous discussion. 

Let's move on.

The most prominent of the non-gamer jerks asserted that the only alternative to playing games is gettin' hammered:

&gt; I'm going to be playing videogames til I'm 80. Id take Enjoying an interactive story rather than getting shitfaced at a bar any day [+36](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav1wei)

which begets a subjerk, including *Section II: Gaming is Cheap*

&gt; This! When I was in the Marines I was harassed because I would stay in the Barracks and play video games in my off time, instead of going out into the the crap-hole town just outside the gate and getting wasted like everyone else. I saved more more money this way and also enjoyed what I was doing. [+14](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav3dio)

and small fry like

&gt;You couldn't have said it any better. I'm almost 30 and I spend my money on games rather than dropping $80- 100 bucks at the bar in a single night. [+1](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav7wnc)

&gt;Even if you buy a new release, buying a game a month is far cheaper entertainment than going out to bars. [+2](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cauym9t)

&gt;I bet most of the people giving you shit spend $60 a night drinking too. [+1](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav602i)

&gt;""Dude, you're a loser for playing video games! You should come out with us and drink at the bar! That's a way healthier lifestyle!"" [+1](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav9pht)

But enough of that; let's look at *Section III: The Only Other Activity in the World is Watching TV*

&gt;My wife and I are 40 and we love playing video games together. The same people who bug you about playing games likely watch three hours of reality TV per day. And read People magazine. [+27](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav0mtx)

&gt;It's usually the ones who are obsessed with sport or some other sort of GAME who make comments such as ""aren't you too old for games"" or ""you play halo, what are you like 12""
Then they go off and cry because their team dropped a ball, or get in a fist fight because a bunch of other men in brightly coloured uniforms kicked a piece of rubber though 2 posts more times than their own bunch of men.
I have never understood this world or the creatures in it. [+8](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav1myb)

&gt;There are some people I know that kinda have the same attitude OP describes. I have a buddy who is unemployed and just watches tv all day. I suggested to him get gfx card for your pc and play some games with us from time to time. His reply, ""I don't have time for all that."" It's funny how some people will watch tv all damn day but turn around and say something to someone who plays games. I watch movies here and there but watch no more than maybe a hr of tv a week. [+5](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav3jhf)

&gt;People don't realize how much tv they watch. I can look on steam and see how many hours I've played games and I can guarantee its lets time than most spend watching shit tv. [+3](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav4r1v) (says a user whose name is literally ""tvreference"")

&gt;Growing up, my dad would bitch up one side and down the other about my brother or I playing games... and then proceed to plop his ass down for 5 hours of baseball or channel surfing. [+4](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav20ha)

&gt;I usually ask people how its any different than watching TV. That usually shuts them up. Hell video games are better. At least they challenge you and require some mental function. [+3](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav25c6)

&gt;These are the same people who either
1. Obsess over fantasy sports
2. Obsess over their kids to the point you block them
3. Follow celebrities and read gossip sites constantly
4. Whine about how bad this generation is
5. Watch reality shows constantly
6. All the above [+2](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav1vb6)

So, there you have it. People who watch TV all day and go to the bar a lot rag on gamers because gamers have more money. Not being a gamer, and not knowing any, I can't say whether or not that actually happens, but the only thing it sounds like to me is high school.

And this is neither here nor there, but as a non-gamer, video games sound ludicrously fucking expensive! I'm tempted to play the occasional one, but a $500 console with $60 games plus subscriptions and extra hardware and a tv to plug it into certainly sounds more expensive than the 3 hours of $4 shot and beer combos I'm going to put in at the local dive this weekend. 

So here is the Big Question: where are the people saying all the stuff these gamers say they hear so often?

I see one allegation of [manchildism](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav2vbd), another with a crap joke about [OP's mom](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav3nv7) and an allegation that gamers ""[contribute nothing to society](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1hj7wv/to_those_who_give_me_shit_for_playing_video_games/cav4vyz),"" but they're all obviously at 0 or below, and I see nobody saying anything about bars or TV being better.

I guess it's possible that, since I don't think I know anyone with any video games more recent than N64, my world experience is totally discontiguous with the people in this thread as well as the people they describe, but this jerk is so monotonous and echoey, even in the lack of an opposing opinion, that I prefer to believe that this is the specter of people ragging on video game players, conjured up by none other than the players themselves.

Bonus points for a post hitting all three jerks:
&gt; I get crap from people sometimes because I'll spend a few hours on a game, rather than go out and spend $6 on a pint of beer. Don't get me wrong, beer is delicious, but I'd rather grab a 6 pack on my own, sit in front of the PC and shoot noobs in the face, than go to a loud bar where I'll spend a lot of money and get nothing out of it but a headache.

&gt;Why is it acceptable to sit in front of a TV watching stupid reruns of shows all night, but playing a game is frowned upon?

Every single one of those threads just devolves into the players of the respective games hating each other. New members ask questions about the differences between the two games, and while all the major points are basically covered in the comments, it's all so biased that it is really hard to take it seriously. For example, the thread [""Sorry if this sounds ignorant, but can someone explain the state of the Smash Games?""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/17hp7b/sorry_if_this_sounds_ignorant_but_can_someone/) has basically become a massive pro-Melee jerk. The top comment starts off:

&gt;Most of us feel that Brawl was a giant step backwards competitively and prefer Melee as the better game. +8

So right off the bat, the person is not giving any fact, just spouting off their personal opinion, and putting in forth in a demeaning and somewhat narrow-minded way. He also presents his opinion as the truth by saying that his opinion is shared by ""most of us"", not bothering to check the number of entrants at events that are equally Melee and Brawl focused, such as Apex (32 pools of around 10-11 for each game -- couldn't find the exact number of entrants). Although it is true that Melee is the game currently in the running for EVO, the Brawl community has gotten, to a greater or lesser extent, behind Melee, so it is (in essence) representing both communities. He then goes on to complain about tripping and defensive playstyle and MetaKnight and stale move negation, which are all perfectly valid points, but does so in an aggressive and condescending way. Also, about a third of his comment seems to be him complaining about how Brawl made the characters he plays in Melee not viable. Which is of course unacceptable.

Later on in the comments, someone brings up combos and how there aren't any in Brawl. From there, it just goes into a massive downward spiral with each side acting like a giant twat.

&gt;Combos in the traditional sense of the term are essentially non-existent in Brawl because of the extremely slow physics, lack of significant hitstun and the total absense of L-cancelling.

&gt;Infinite grabs are kind of their own thing, and don't really count as combos, or at least aren't considered as such in the same sense as a Street Fighter combo.

Combos are a staple of most fighting games, and maybe the community should feel this way about Brawl. But I think the ideas of having one- or four-hit string, adjustable for DI, as opposed to having 0 to death combos like it seems people in the thread want, is a perfectly valid system. Also, he calls infinites not combos, which confuses me. The definition he provides, which is from Wikipedia, is:

&gt;In video games, a combo is a term that designates a set of actions performed in sequence, usually with strict timing limitations, that yield a significant benefit or advantage.

Well, in that case, things like the IC chaingrab would definitely be called a combo. So by admitting that there are infinites, he is admitting that there are combos in Brawl, thereby rendering his whole argument kind of moot.

Someone else posted:

&gt;Brawl is in many cases the opposite: it is deep in a horizontal sense. It's a wonderful celebration of all things Nintendo, fan service up the ass. Throw in a ton of new characters, stages, and items, and you've got Brawl. While the outer layer of Brawl's onion is vast and aesthetically pleasing, the gameplay at its core is unbalanced and shallow. As gamers peel away Brawl's layers, they realize there is little to be found beyond the superficial.

Wut.

Players defending Brawl also got downvoted, whereas comments like

&gt;Infinites are not combos, but combos can be infinite.

(which is in direct contrast to Wikipedia again; same author)

and

&gt;Almost all of Brawl's combos are really cheesy, such as laser locks, grab releases, and chain grabs. Melee's combos are legit and improvisational in nature.

are at +6 and +7 respectively. This comment,

&gt;Brawl does have real combos.

linking to 9b vs. ADHD (a match exemplifying 9B's amazing grab game), is at -3. The thread seems to be somewhat biased here, people.

This sort of thing happens in other threads, too. [The comment section of a Brawl video](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1a0zmy/best_ice_climbers_vs_best_mk_japan_vs_usa_m2k_vs/) are exemplified by:

&gt;That was one of the most boring things I have ever watched in my life +18

and

&gt;Man, this just makes me not want to play brawl. +5

The thread [""Why is Melee superior?""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/11eozy/why_is_melee_superior/) (just look at the title) from a while ago has intelligent discussion such as:

&gt;melee is a lot more balanced than brawl fox vs fox on final destination almost NEVERRRRRR happens in competitive melee play nowadays. that whole thing was a giant misconception by a bunch of dumb cocksuckers who like to spread their own ignorance. +13

and

&gt;Brawl is slow bullshit, melee is fast bullshit. +11

The thread [""FACT: Melee is NOT more competitive than Brawl""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/10vevx/fact_melee_is_not_more_competitive_than_brawl/) (yes, the title is horribly phrased and states an opinion presenting it as a fact but let's move on) inspired:

&gt;Wrong. Melee is both more technical and more competitive. Firstly, let me start by saying Brawl is indeed competitive. No doubt about that as it's a good fighting game. Obviously there is a large community that travels a lot and the game still has a lot of die-hard fans. Even so, Melee at it's most popular was scores ahead of Brawl in that regard. Using your logic if we compare Chess to Checkers I can say that because hundreds of people travel to play in checkers tournaments or play online checkers that it's just as competitive as Chess. What you don't seem to understand is the fact that Melee is more technical is what makes it more competitive. Sure, the community is much smaller, but the game itself is by far the most complex fighting game ever. If Brawl is Checkers, Melee is Chess. You simply can't tell me that Chess isn't more competitive than Checkers. I'm not saying anyone can pick up Brawl and be great, but the years it takes to get very good at Melee is the difference. The strategies combined with the technical skill, and the speed at which it all unfolds is what makes Melee that much harder to master. +10

and

&gt;expect P:M to do better then smash 4 because Sakurai is just going to remake brawl with a couple new levels and a character or 2. i believe its now up to the community to make the game good not sakurai. Only +2 but then again no downvotes.

In fact, the whole comments section of that thread is pretty stupid.

I stopped discussing the last comments because I think they speak for themselves. most of the examples I took were of people defending Melee mainly because I think that is far more common in the subreddit than the opposite. Then again, I could dig up many examples of people defending Brawl being hateful/dismissive.

If this reads a little weird, it's because it was originally angry modmail I wrote some time ago that I decided to edit a little and post here. Turns out I had actually quoted one of the mods in the message. Whatever.

Still too much for r/gaming,PrimeLiberty,108,23,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/19rhq7/price_of_a_new_game_hasnt_changed_in_nearly_a/,"So [this](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/19px56/dear_game_developers_please_stop_telling_us_60/) article got some serious upvotes on gaming.  It's a response to the article posted by one of the head people over at Epic games.  It is maddening that such a poorly written article (less than 400 words and takes a cheap shot at supporters of DLC as being out of touch with ""regular"" gamers"") can end up on the front page.  


As the title says, the writer thinks that gaming companies are condescending when they say that $60 isn't that much for a new game.  I've been gaming for close to 10 years now, and I can't remember a time when a game didn't cost $60.  That means there have been no price hikes in that time period, which is astounding.  Gas prices have tripled in the U.S. in that same time frame.  But somehow this is still a valid complaint for this ass and the legions of people at r/gaming.  



I bought two games last year, Borderlands 2, and Mass Effect 3.  Both have provided me with over 100 hours of entertainment.  Compare that to seeing six movies in a theater or going to dinner with friends six times, and that does come out to be a great deal.  Also consider that the cost of making games now is ENORMOUS.  Most games are tens of millions of dollars to make and they still have stayed at the same price!  
Most of the comment section points this stuff out, but the top comment still irritates me.  

&gt;[Although I prefer games to be cheaper, I don't have a huge problem with $60 for a video game. It's $60 for a 'video game' with multiple day 1 DLC's and pay to win microtransactions that I have major problems with.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/19px56/dear_game_developers_please_stop_telling_us_60/c8q9eqy)

How can you not see that this trend has been happening because game prices have not changed in a long time?  Gaming companies have to put out DLC right away if they are going to get back the huge amounts of money they put into the game being made.

Hey, I like the Onion. The writers there are great and they know how to get to the heart of an issue without even having to talk about the issue directly. I think they're really an intelligent set of people. 

Well, then they posted this: http://www.theonion.com/articles/no-one-murdered-because-of-this-image,29553/ (NSFW by the way)

And reddit goes berserk. Well, what do you expect? It has anti-religious sentiments, a bit of porn, and humor. It's a funny article, and it does say something about current issues, but some comments are annoying me quite a bit.

But seriously, people. SERIOUSLY?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypizu/i_know_im_not_a_student_of_art_and_i_know_its/). Now I know r/WTF is definitely not the place I should look for interesting modern art analysis, but I am always dumbfounded by how little these people understand the purpose and history of modern art. Seeing the piece in it's exhibition, in the original form, with a knowledge of the artistic movements and visions that spawned it, aka the context, is absolutely integral to understanding the piece. A few weeks ago another redditor posted a 320 square pixel jpeg of a [Joan Miro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Mir%C3%B3) that was ridiculed for being sold for millions of dollars. As I had just seen a wonderful Miro exhibit, this thread perturbed me quite a bit. I sought to understand why these redditors jumped at the chance to mock something I, and many others, find extremely thought provoking and intellectually and artistically valuable. I think it stems from a lack of art education, a fear of being seen as uneducated or ignorant for not 'getting' the art, and a resentment of the fact that these artists are wealthy and successful for something the hivemind deems easy or scam-like.

The responses in these threads often follow very similar patterns, such as [ridiculing people who appreciate such art as hipsters/phonies](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypizu/i_know_im_not_a_student_of_art_and_i_know_its/c5xozdh). Because, of course, only a person pretending to be intelligent would find something I don't appreciate cool, right? [Here is](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypizu/i_know_im_not_a_student_of_art_and_i_know_its/c5xrh3p) a comment combining BOTH of these comments into one judgmental pile of butt, including the implication that artist and hipster are synonyms. And [here is](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypizu/i_know_im_not_a_student_of_art_and_i_know_its/c5xs5ar) a comment implying that anyone who appreciates unorthodox art is a drug addict or a freak.

Then there's the [painting modern art lovers as condescending jerks](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypizu/i_know_im_not_a_student_of_art_and_i_know_its/c5xreuu ). This one I find ironic, considering *they* are the ones mocking a whole century of artistic expression. I also think the insecurity really is strong in this comment. Did some bully insult poor kc10crewchief for not appreciating art when he as young? We also have [comparing to a completely unrelated and much more extreme artistic work](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypizu/i_know_im_not_a_student_of_art_and_i_know_its/c5xp5aa). Seriously, how is this link even remotely related to the original work posted?

Lastly, we have [this ridiculous comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ypizu/i_know_im_not_a_student_of_art_and_i_know_its/c5xrwkd) that defies any explanation as to how it could have over 100 upvotes. Further in that chain we get a nice dose of 'everything in the past was better and everything today sucks'.

So why is this jerk so successful? Every modern/contemporary art post on main reddit is so full of scorn and smugness that I find it mind boggling. Well the central theme of these comments seems to be that redditors (generally a very technically oriented and single minded bunch) are afraid of 'art lovers' pulling a fast one on them. So they seek to justify their lack of understanding or interest in this material by mocking the people who do appreciate it or even the industry as whole. After all, those art hipsters can't be in on the joke if the *are* the joke. However, I have to explore why they don't feel comfortable simply discounting this piece. Every discussion about particular works *has* to expand to modern/contemporary art as a whole. I believe redditors are afraid of being deemed ignorant for not appreciating this works, and thus must discredit the whole industry. I wonder why redditors don't feel comfortable simply saying *I do not find this piece of art valuable or interesting*. I think it stems from a lack of art education or exposure to a variety of contemporary and modern art. After all, if I don't know about it, it must not be worth knowing about, right?

Now to be fair, there are SOME comments discussing the work or defending modern/contemporary art as a whole, but many of them it's quite difficult to tell if they're being sarcastic or not.

Anyways, that's it for me.

The gist of the thread is that there is a teacher in the USA who is in hot water for calling a student a ""nigga"". He cites the ""they say it, so why can't I?"" argument.

Can you guess Reddit's reaction? They defend him. They think that because black people call each other ""nigga"" - *they* should be able to say the word too. Many even go as far to claim that it is racism to not allow white people to say it, but to allow black people to.. 

Neckbeard Eleid writes this: 

&gt;You know what, they (blacks) call eachother ""nigga's"" all the time. For them to get all bent out of shape when a white person calls them one is hypocrisy at its finest. These types of double standard shouldn't be tolerated.

What bravery. Notice the tone he uses? ""Shouldn't be tolerated"", like he is some badass moral arbiter. 

He then continues: 

&gt;Not ""oh this argument again"", this is a legitimate argument. You can't say a word is ok for one group of people (based off skin color) then say it isn't ok for another group (also based off skin color). That type of double standard IS RACISM.

**Wow**. Did you guys see that? This Neckbeard is calling it *racist* to be upset by white people calling black people niggers. **That's** the racist part? What a fucking smug idiot. 

And you want to know the scary part? **This guy is being heavily upvoted**. 

I've seen this kind of rhetoric spewed all over Reddit time and time again. Neckbeards are incapable of understanding social and racial context. There is a reason why black people can get away with calling each other niggas; it's because they share a specific history and culture wherein it is acceptable to do so. A white person doesn't have this tie - so it is therefore not acceptable to use the word in reference to a black person. 

I don't understand why the Neckbeards can't grasp this. Most of them (i'm guessing) are younger, middle class students who don't really have anything in their life to cite as an example for discrimination. So what do they do? They find someone else's discrimination and try to pretend it is theirs. 

Not everyone is equal and not everyone is free to communicate to others in equal ways. Double standards exist all over society and they exist for a reason. Language is entirely dependent on the context of the relationships of the communicators.

I just wish these self righteous Neckbeards could understand this.

Even disregarding all this, why do these Neckbeards even *want* to say the word so badly? Why are they wasting hours of their lives trying to claim they should be able to say it too? I think it is a horrible word that has caused horrible harm to people - I sure as shit don't want to say it. I realise that I don't have the contextual and cultural necessities to say the word, so I shut my fucking mouth. 

I'm really, truly starting to view the hivemind as racist now. I never really thought they were; I thought they were just arrogant and desperate to be persecuted against in made up ways. But more and more I see examples of some pretty true racism coming from them. It's probably not the type of racism that is going to get anyone lynched, but it's still racism.

Ooooh boy, I should have known I was getting into from that title with the P-word (which totally isn't theft or stealing - it's totally, totally, 100% night and day different). 

Hoping, praying, that I could enter the comments and participate in a discussion of this interesting case study in which an Indie game developer purposefully (and secretly) released a cracked version of their game (a software development simulator - holy meta, Batman) on popular file-sharing websites shortly before releasing the actual version of their game for $8 - however, these 'cracked' versions eventually force the player to lose the game because of rampant piracy. Yay, irony! Yay, interesting discussion!

Of course not, we must use this opportunity to wage war with those who oppose piracy! Especially those damn greedy game developers who make the games we like to play...

Didn't take long, 2nd comment down:

&gt; Would we be hearing about the game right now if it hadn't been pirated so heavily?

[[+441]](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1dcah8/97_of_game_dev_tycoon_players_pirated_the_game/c9oyi79)

Ah, the classic ""Piracy provides free marketing"" excuse. Nothing excites game developers more than the free publicity that comes with rampant piracy and no actual sales. Why don't all companies just pre-release their games on file-sharing sites? That way, us pirates get better access to games for free, and game developers benefit from us neckbeards telling all of our friends to go buy your game!

&gt; This is true... I have been making this argument since the early 2000's. I remember when I was about 10 years younger and I liked to play around with photoshop.. the software was probably over $200 bucks... I know for a fact I wouldn't have been able to afford it(then).. so whether I pirated it or not.. it would have done Adobe no good. This same theory applies for music that I may have had a small interest in... If I didn't truly LOVE an artist I was not going to purchase the album.. If I liked it and decided to pirate it then that wouldn't have made any difference as far as the music industry goes either.

[[+30]](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1dcah8/97_of_game_dev_tycoon_players_pirated_the_game/c9p1oht)

Hear that, guys? Piracy is okay as long as you're pirating things you're lukewarm about. I think that Coldplay is just meh, so I'm going to pirate their music and see if it grows on me. That way, they benefit because I'll totally buy more of their albums later instead of pirating more. Everyone is owed a free trial on everything digital because, you know, it doesn't cost you anything to give it to me for free!

&gt; It's called cheap marketing. You upload a cracked version of your game to a torrent then contact a bunch of game news outlets with the catchy title that ""97% of game dev tycoon players pirated the game."" A few hours later, your game has thousands more hits than it ever would have without you even having to spend a dime.
Pretty simple stuff...

Again, flawless logic. Give away your game to pirates, and then complain about piracy, and... more people will go buy the game? BRB, E-mailing EA about this.

Amazingly, many Redditors became quite specific about the set of circumstances that make piracy okay. Here were some of my favorites:

&gt; Legitimate reasons to pirate, in my opinion:
Any reason that would affect your choice when buying later, such as testing system requirements, demoing, etc.
cost is prohibitively high (including DLC)
the paid-for game is fundamentally broken or inhibited (always-online DRM)

[[+4]](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1dcah8/97_of_game_dev_tycoon_players_pirated_the_game/c9p5m8e)

&gt; I buy all my games, but if I buy a game and the DRM trips me up once, I have no qualms grabbing a cracked torrent of that game, I don't see how that's not the best excuse ever for pirating.


[[+6]](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1dcah8/97_of_game_dev_tycoon_players_pirated_the_game/c9p6sd0)

Except you're breaking the software license you paid for? I'm not saying DRM isn't shitty, but you sort of entered into that agreement when you chose to buy the license.

I just can't stand the level of entitlement among what I presume must be the teenage vocal majority. I can't afford it/don't think it's worth the money, but I still deserve to have it for free!

I'll leave you with this:

&gt; I don't think entitlement is the right word. It's a very opinion-variant word because everyone feels like they deserve something. When I was 14, 15, 16 I pirated pretty much every game that I played. I pirated all my shows and movies. I pirated all my software.
Why? Well, for games it was because **I rarely saw sales, and wasn't willing to spend a month of 0 freetime going from school straight to chores then to bed to earn the money for a single game that I might not even like.**

Actually, it turns out,

One user can't wrap his head around it

&gt;People downvote alot of posts in this thread making jokes about helping science by squeezing boobs and seeing it makes me think... What the fuck else am I suppose to say?

He receives a straightforward answer,

&gt;Because the rules say comments in this subreddit are not to be jokes. You can see it in the sidebar right over there. ----&gt;

And my favorite part of the thread, the revolution begins.

&gt;We should repost this to another subreddit so we can actually enjoy ourselves without someone telling us boobs are nothing to make jokes about.

Oppression! If my boob jokes won't be appreciated, then I'll take them elsewhere! Then you'll have no boob jokes, let's see who's laughing then! You will beg me to return!

I would post other comments, but they are all variations of these low hanging fruits,

&gt;* I have been curing cancer this whole time! (I touch boobs a lot get it?)  
&gt;* Now I can get more boob touching! I like boobs!  
&gt;* Fuck yeah science and boobs

And I'm not joking, there's about 20 of each. I don't need to link to any in particular, just open the thread and you'll be knee-deep.

&gt;but [the Palestinians], like the Jews, have been suffering under the oppressive rule of regime after regime for millenia.

The modern state of Israel has only existed since 1947. Do you actually believe that the Jews have been systematically oppressing the Palestinians for 1000 years?

Oh great, Blogspot. Another bastion of dependable integrity. Lets see what the article says.

&gt;People don't understand Arab anger against Israel.  I am 52 years-old and in my life time, Israel has bombed Sudan, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Iraq.  And in all those wars and attacks, it portrays itself as a victim.  And I did not count its war on Arabs around the world, including its murder of a Moroccan waiter in Norway because he resembled a Palestinian leader.  It even downed a Libyan civilian airliner in 1973 because it ""suspected"" (wrongly) that a Palestinian leader was on board.  This criminal war record of Israel is not covered in your morning papers in the West.  If you read Arabic and can see what young Arabs are writings on Facebook and Twitter, you will understand a bit more about Arab politics. You will understand for sure that the Jordanian puppet King does not speak for Arab youths, as you seem to have been assuming since the beginning of Arab uprisings.  

That's it. That's the whole fucking article. ARE YOU GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKING KIDDING ME? You stupid douchebags upvoted the ramblings of someone who claims to be Arab but offers no evidence to substantiate their claims. IT'S NOT EVEN FUCKING NEWS OR POLITICS! It's just some jackass with a keyboard saying inflammatory things without evidence. I'd call this trolling if I wasn't so convinced by the rest of the posts on the front page that this is supposed to be legitimate.

It is one of my favorite shows and although season 4 has been lackluster, it still has that charm to me. I find it funny but if other people don't I'm not going to take offense to it and I can see that the show has its flaws.

I really dislike how smug /r/community can be though.  I never really had much to complain about until [this post](http://reddit.com/r/community/comments/1d5ekp/just_started_watching_apparently_not_everyone_in/) decided to grace that subreddit.  It is so fucking self congratulatory by just that title, but let’s see what the denizens of community have to say.  The top comment is pretty inoffensive by any means so I’ll just ignore that, but a few of the posts below are just...wow

[Because you need to think to understand this show, and you aren't told when to laugh from a laughtrack.

Evidently the only reason why anyone would dislike the show is because they can’t understand it or, a better way to put it, we’re smarter than everyone else.  The reason I think shows like AD and Community weren't/aren't huge hits is because you kind of have to watch the show from the beginning or else it simply is not as funny to you.  But no, it's because other viewers just don't pay attention.

[People want shows to tell them when something is funny cough laughtrack cough cough big bang theory cough](http://reddit.com/r/community/comments/1d5ekp/just_started_watching_apparently_not_everyone_in/c9n1jph)

You can witness this phenomenon in any LEGO™-related thread, and today I chose this post in /r/pics: [""My wife discovered Legos late in life. (Album in comments + Cat)""](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/15m2iz/my_wife_discovered_legos_late_in_life_album_in/)

Within the top comment, the obsession begins after a wayward redditor has (apparently, now edited) used the dreaded -s plural form of LEGO™ toy bricks.

Nor can their attempt at defending this blasphemous position be permitted!

The third-highest upvoted comment is, of course, another message from your friendly LEGO™ toy brick enthusiast that it is not, shall never be, and must never be... *Legos*.

&gt;[It's lego. Lego is the plural of lego. Like sheep. [+118]](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/15m2iz/my_wife_discovered_legos_late_in_life_album_in/c7nq0d5)

More:

&gt;[The whole point is that it's not a plural at all. I get annoyed when people say 'Legos' (in a jokey defense-of-childhood-convention way) because I'm not talking about individual bricks, I'm saying ""I am playing with [the singular product] Lego"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/15m2iz/my_wife_discovered_legos_late_in_life_album_in/c7nr7ra)

When I hear the word ""Legos"" I reach for my Browning! (emphasis mine)

&gt;[Oh god thank you and some others below you for pointing this out.

&gt;[Not Legos. [+9]](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/15m2iz/my_wife_discovered_legos_late_in_life_album_in/c7nrjmy)

Momentarily, however, the voting chain is reversed as ""Legos"" sees its first positive comment score! Starts [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/15m2iz/my_wife_discovered_legos_late_in_life_album_in/c7nq7z3), but the reply comes in...

&gt;[Fuck it man, they're Legos. [+4]](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/15m2iz/my_wife_discovered_legos_late_in_life_album_in/c7nqrdo)

It devolves into another argument. There are Lego/Legos debates (or arguments or whatever) elsewhere in the thread, but not near the top like the above comments.

As I wrote above, what is the obsession with making sure that everyone knows they are definitively not referred to in a plural form as ""Legos?"" I can't think of any other word used on the site that is subject to such intense scrutiny and accompanied by sometimes (often?) petty arguments.

&gt;Fun fact: in 2011, Susan G. Komen for the Cure CEO Nancy Goodman Brinker made $417,712.

The top reply to that?  
&gt;Yeah who says 417k a year is a low salary? for a company that probably does very little besides make merchandise that is pink.

Now obviously Reddit's armchair business moguls have the expertise to tell us exactly how much the executive of, what I would imagine is one of the largest charities in the US if not world, should be making. They of course don't offer much to back up that sentiment but come on it's self evident like natural rights.  
I've noticed recently that Redditors have the tendency to sacrifice everything in hypothetical situations and believe everyone else should too. Further down the thread in response to someone asking if a commenter would be willing to work for free:  
&gt;It's an organization built on people's goodwill. Yes, for someone who is doing it for the ""greater good,"" I would expect this. Ambassador Brinker has other means of revenue anyway.

It becomes really fucking hard to take sides with Reddit re: taxes on the wealthy, atheism and the rest of the hivemind's politics when you realize just how skewed their world view is. This isn't the first time I've seen this mentality. Full disclosure there are posts calling all this stuff out but they have ~10 upvotes compared to hundreds for the other ones. 

Anyway, [on to the next one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM1RChZk1EU).

&gt;Financial aid. A loan is a loan, you're not ""aiding"" anyone. Also, paying for degrees in things like English or History.

Oh, and don't forget to fork over the extra $200 per semester for textbooks you'll open twice!

&gt;Why are you spoiling a 7 year old with an iPod Touch? This is why kids are so fucked.


God damn! It's just an iPod! Everyone had a Gameboy as a kid, what's wrong with an iPod? Believe it or not, kids can think too!

DAE like S[weed]en, le glorious STEM, and eugenics??""  Now before I start, I do have to bring up that the post has a fair amount of downvotes (only 61% of the voters 'like' it at time of my post).  But without further ado, here we go:  

On a more 'positive' note,  the current top comment: 
&gt;That not everyone should go to college. We need ditch digger and trashmen as much as we need doctors and engineers.  

Someone on reddit actually thinking non-STEM majors are worth something?  

&gt;ITT: Popular unpopular opinions.
 
Fairly high up, reddit seems to be self-aware, at least for now.  

Now to be done with the positivity
 
&gt;That if you join the military, you're agreeing to be shot at.
 
Anti-military comment, because you know, everyone who joins the military is joining an infantry/combat role...  

&gt;Mandatory birth-control should be a requirement for receiving welfare. No more babies till you get your ass a job.     

DAE EUGENICS?
&gt;Mine is that we need to have population control laws like China.

More eugenics.  Because fuck freedom, right?

&gt;also certain people should not be allowed or be limited on having kids. Not really talking about making a master race or anything, but more along the lines of some people just don't have the proper means to raise kids. Kids should not have to live in a broken home with 8 siblings and a single mom who can't provide for them. They deserve a real chance it's not their fault and we shouldn't allow it!
  
More eugenics, but at least this one is thinking of the good of the children.  

&gt;People who are considered mentally or physically retarded or otherwise genetically inferior should not be allowed to procreate. The reason animals have survived and remained healthy and stable as individual species is because the weak and genetically destructive members have been weeded out by natural selection. The human race, with all its acceptance and, well, humanity, will inevitably end up a dilapidated reminder of the glorious beings we once were. I sometimes debate having kids myself because of some minor physical and mental features and genetic dispositions I find undesirable to pass onto my children.
  

And even more eugenics, you get the point here, reddit really loves thinking that they should be able to control the population.  

&gt;aid to africa should stop, and the aid your giving should go to your country.. im going to hell
  
Because fuck everyone else, right?  

&gt;I don't believe pedophilia is inherently wrong. Our society just makes it. 

Don't even know where to start with this one... 

And bonus, the top reply:  

&gt;It's not wrong to be born like that.
However being a child predator is wrong.  

Typical ephebophile/pedophile-sympathizing bullshit reddit pulls.

Two weeks ago, someone posted this to /r/beer:

[Two free Killians pint glasses. Get them before they're gone!](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/18poms/two_free_killians_pint_glasses_get_them_before/)

MillerCoors/George Killian's had a promo where you were supposed to buy a 12-pack of Killian's Irish Red, and then use the promo to score two free pint glasses. The pint glasses would be shipped for free. 

It's a pretty cool promo, but someone in the MillerCoors advertising department fucked up. It turns out you could use the same UPC code multiple times (or there was only one code). Someone posted the code to the Internet, and hundreds of people tried to sign up to score free glasses. That included the denizens of /r/beer. Hey, a free glass, why not? Of course, /r/beer had no problem signing up for a free glass. They also seemed to have no issue parting with their personal information:

&gt;[Awesome. I've just given my name and address out to who knows whom, but fuck it I've gotten some pint glasses.](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/18poms/two_free_killians_pint_glasses_get_them_before/c8gwf2g)

.

&gt;[I get crap in the mail anyway, so what lol](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/18poms/two_free_killians_pint_glasses_get_them_before/c8gx68s)

.

&gt;[Hell, I'd give my name and address to the *IRS* for some pint glasses.](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/18poms/two_free_killians_pint_glasses_get_them_before/c8h22y6)

This is /r/beer...a place that circlejerks about how terrible BudMillerCoors on a regular basis. So you had a few comments like this as well:

&gt;[Awesome! No CC info, nor S&amp;H charges! I will fill your glasses with someone else's beer, but thanks!!
](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/18poms/two_free_killians_pint_glasses_get_them_before/c8gz2p8)

A few users did inquire about the logistics of hundreds of people using the same UPC:

&gt;[So was I supposed to buy a case of beer or something to get the UPC? Just wondering how much chaos this is going to cause.](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/18poms/two_free_killians_pint_glasses_get_them_before/c8gxh2o)

No biggie...right...

 ================**ACT TWO**========================

...except of course, Killian's and MillerCoors fucked up. There were some comments in the original thread:

&gt;[I just received an email from the company.](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/18poms/two_free_killians_pint_glasses_get_them_before/c8m2f0m)

And, indeed, George Killians sent everyone this email (which ended up in most people's spam folder):

***It's clear that everyone is excited for St. Patrick's Day! Our ""Get Your St. Pat's Pints"" glassware offer was a big hit. In the last few days, we saw a lot of unexpected and unusual activity surrounding the promotion and we went through our supply of George Killian's pint glasses even more quickly than anticipated. Unfortunately, we got your code after supplies ran out. Thanks for drinking Killian's. Cheers!***

	    Sincerely,
    The George Killian's Team

Of course, there was a thread about the email:

[Got this from the The George Killian's Team today.](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/19aod4/got_this_from_the_the_george_killians_team_today/)

And...the folks at /r/beer weighed in, hard:


&gt;[A shrewd business would have ended participation once they received a predetermined number of submissions. Oh well, I'll continue to not drink their beer.
](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/19aod4/got_this_from_the_the_george_killians_team_today/c8mcp54)

And suddenly, concern over the personal information parted with arises....

&gt;[So what happens to our personal information? Do they get to keep it even though we don't get a glass?](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/19aod4/got_this_from_the_the_george_killians_team_today/c8mfog2)

It's okay though, ""I don't even like Killians anyway:""

&gt;[I was surprised though when it accepted my entry cause I did it 2 days after it opened. Whatever, not like I lost anything. I don't even like killians. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/19aod4/got_this_from_the_the_george_killians_team_today/c8mbset)

&gt;[No glass here either. Harp for Saint Patrick's Day it is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/19aod4/got_this_from_the_the_george_killians_team_today/c8mdsau)

And then comes the talk of conspiracy....

&gt;[I would like to wager that there were never any glasses to be given away. The whole ""giveaway"" could have just been a marketing scheme to inspire interest in their beer. I could be wrong but I don't see anyone posting any pictures of their glasses, just rejection letters (Although, I too have a rejection email). Who knows, I could just be a conspiracy theorist. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/19aod4/got_this_from_the_the_george_killians_team_today/c8mi17h)

I did like this reality check, because it's true:

&gt;[Most people in this sub don't even *like* Killian's.  Did everyone seriously just lose their shit over the possibility of a free fucking pint glass?  Get a grip, people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/19aod4/got_this_from_the_the_george_killians_team_today/c8mkayj)

I guess that's the end of that....right? WRONG.

 ================**ACT THREE**========================

/r/beer decided to make another thread, and this one has 151 replies, many of them smacking of a huge sense of entitlement:

[Anyone get their George Killian's pint glasses yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/19kurm/anyone_get_their_george_killians_pint_glasses_yet/)

Let's just recap real quick. The people on /r/beer had no problem handing their personal information over (evidently valued at two free pint glasses). Also, /r/beer HATES BudMillerCoors, and don't really like Killians in the first place.

To be fair, MillerCoors and Killians also really fucked this promo up. They obviously did not have enough supply, and they poorly set up this promo. No doubt there.

Now for some choice comments in /r/beer....

&gt;[I'm starting to think there are no glasses, and this is just crappy marketing.

I will do my best to avoid them here, but be wary if you click on the link below.

Anyway, in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/16kofo/spoilers_affc_stumbled_on_a_harsh_critique_of/), a user posts a link to a critique of book four in ASOIAF: *A Feast for Crows* (AFFC). It says it was slow and boring and, while he may not have a lot of patience for the book, he offers up some valid criticisms and says he is not optimistic about the (then-unreleased) upcoming *A Dance with Dragons*.

Certainly some dissent should be good for discussion, right? Nice to see some outside perspective?

[Wrong](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/16kofo/spoilers_affc_stumbled_on_a_harsh_critique_of/c7wxhqb) .

&gt; This guy outright says that all he wants to see is clear heroes fighting clear villains, and that he doesn't like it when most characters are ""complex, gray-shaded people."" Since GRRM has the exact opposite viewpoint, **he is clearly reading the wrong series**. **(+385**, emphasis mine)

In [response:](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/16kofo/spoilers_affc_stumbled_on_a_harsh_critique_of/c7x1bdb)

&gt;He raised some interesting points though. The criticism he has is the same criticism a lot of people here have.  **(a measly +28)**

And shortly  below that, various people saying the GOT equivalent of ""THIS!""

&gt;It is known

-

&gt;Yeah, his criticism basically amounts to, ""Gee, now why'd you have to go and make me think? I don't want to do that when I read.""

-

&gt;Yeah, apparently his definition of fantasy only involves black and white conceptions of morality.

-

&gt;Yeah this guy needs to invest in some Harry Potter and Belgariad. Two great series- but he won't have to think about moral relativism.

Yes, stop reading ASOIAF and go read some other peasant filth, like Harry Potter. 

[Next reply.](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/16kofo/spoilers_affc_stumbled_on_a_harsh_critique_of/c7wwvnb)

&gt;The people who don't like AFFC are not viewing this as part of a greater picture, they are reviewing the book as a solo work. ...  Yes, the pacing is slow - the characters don't progress much - nothing really changes...but that's what is nice about it

Oh.

When someone [disagrees](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/16kofo/spoilers_affc_stumbled_on_a_harsh_critique_of/c7wzt1v), they again call him out:

&gt;There's more to literature than plot. 

Further below, people who didn't read the article (which is about book four - AFFC - not book five - *A Dance with Dragons*).

&gt;ADWD may not be the best book in the series, but I don't see how you can say it sucks

-

&gt;Frankly, having read ADWD, we know that this opinion is wrong.

Welp.

&gt;For everything that is popular, there is some pretentious Bachelor of Arts student who feels the incessant need to criticise it. 

-

&gt;I think this guy should probably read a simpler series of books with less complex characters and a more explicit story. After all, that seems to be what he's looking for. Why he is looking for all this in ASoIaF of all places, I have no clue.

Go read rubbish if you can't *understand the complexity* of these books!

Granted, there is some dissent, and people saying ""Well he *does* have a point..."" but those are considerably lower than the top few replies calling the guy out. But still - the sheer audacity of an audience to say ""Well if you don't like it, you must not understand it/go read something I deem lower quality/etc.""

It falls in line with other jerks around reddit. Don't like 'The Wire'? Go watch NCIS because you can't handle good drama. Don't like 'Breaking Bad'? Enjoy 'Two and a Half Men' or 'Big Bang Theory,' because you clearly don't know good television!

And with that, I depart. Sorry if it came off rantish.

&gt;First of all I'd like to thank /u/dhamster for creating this glorious subreddit. Without that, I'd... I don't really know. Probably be doing whatever I'm doing, but not writing this.

&gt;I'd like to acnoledge /u/Aco620 and his timely death because ::snore:: your long winded posts were putting me to sleep. If I need a tl;dr of a tl;dr, you're doing something wrong.

&gt;Honerable mention to /u/Sagion for fighting for gender equality and getting your modship through your womenly wilds.

&gt;/u/YTknows also for his timely death and savant like CSS styling. I crai evry tiem.

&gt;I'd like to kick /u/Klaatu_Barad_Nikto in the nuts for being an overall dick.

&gt;/u/godOfAtheism for being *my Waifu*

&gt;No one can forget /u/twentyone_21 for your faith smashing logic.

&gt;/u/Kitchendancer for actually doing mod stuff, well and /u/K_Lobstah for doing far more mod stuff. You guys are the business casual coke head staff we've always wanted. Prompt and always ""going to the bathroom for... things"". 

&gt;/u/lolsail for working the graveyard shi(f)t. May not one Dropbear devour your head, amen, FSM.

&gt;Well of course /u/Cariban, (for unbanning me, lol. It rhymes.) for being our first default mod. I assume your experience for removing shit is like finding farts in a car.

&gt;Well since my time is about to run out, I'd like to thank /u/TotallyNotCool (Lyfter du ens, syrran?), /u/New_Wav (Mr. J), /u/nruticat (for feeding my cat), and last, but not least (this is a hell of a run on) /u/eliasqfuntybunt, for taking second watch. That's my most hated.

I honestly am no longer surprised by things like this but when [this thread appeared in askreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/14trt2/gang_membersformer_gang_members_of_reddit_what/) it was pretty much destined to be shit. 

&gt;Gang members/former gang members of reddit, what did you do for gang initiation?

One, the demographics of reddit simply do not include many people who are educated or involved with urban/gang culture. So what to do then? Well, the obvious answer is act racist, crude, and ignorant! To the front page!

Subreddit mod, [SupermanV2](http://www.reddit.com/user/supermanv2) removed the AMA not long after it had started and the official reason was that OAG was ""internet (or reddit?) famous"".

What happens when you take a candy from a child? Bad things. But redditors are obviously more sophisticated than a child so instead of crying they started crying *and* barking. Superman didn't help it and strated acting like a dick and gave redditors reason to call him dick^2 while ignoring their hateful posts full of dickishness.

Just as every animal, we could observe redditors in their natural habitat cool down and, as there was sufficient number of reposts, redirect their blistering rage on OPs fishing for karma and bravely upvoting threads marked with [OC].

But some self-righteous Internet knights haven't had enough and today's [5 year old kid AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/11ev7u/itt_we_ask_condescending_questions_of_a_fiveyear/) forced them out of their ~~lairs~~ chateaus to point out the injustice - their lady OAG couldn't read their disgusting Liebesbriefe about how they want her to suck their cocks or be their wife or participate in their favourite fetishes.

1345898845.0,80,self.circlebroke,ysy5l,Julian Assange and the Great Escape,eighthgear,98,18,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/ysy5l/julian_assange_and_the_great_escape/,"[Well, I guess today was time for another round of Assange jerking](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/yrghs/secret_police_documents_reveal_wikileaks_founder/).

Basically, a photo of an apparently not-so-secret plan was taken, saying that Britain intends to arrest Assange if he leaves the Ecuadorian embassy (which is their right). So what does Reddit do? Their is the usual AMERIKKA = EVIL and BRITAIN = PAWNS jerks,

&gt; When a Libyan diplomat opened fire from the embassy window in London and killed officer Yvonne Fletcher, it lead to a standoff at the embassy that ended when all diplomats were expelled with no arrests. The UK is trying harder to capture someone (ostensibly) for sexual assault in Sweden than they did for murdering one of their own countrymen. So yes, based on precedent it was ""in question"".


And the like. But more hilarious are all the Redditors who watched a bit too much James Bond and have come up with idiotic ways to get Assange out of the embassy. The two most common plans proposed are ""flash mobs"" (hint: they wouldn't be flash mobs):

&gt; Way to escape. Arrange with hundreds of trusted protesters to all dress i exactly the same hoodie and be on the streets in front of the building. Have 20/30 people from inside the building wearing the same hoodie run out all at the same time and blend in with crowd. Crowd disperses.


Yeah, cause the cops totally can't arrest protestors, because DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY. Oh wait, they can, for causing a massive public disturbance. The cops can also do stuff like cordon off areas.

&gt; Here's an idea....flash mob call to dress in all black with an eyehole balaclava and arrive with someone else driving a car and who remains with their car parked anywhere...hundreds of people show up at the embassy...are led into the embassy on official invite...lights are turned off and Assange joins them under darkness in the room and with some loudish music playing...then everyone is told to all rush out of the embassy and run to their respective cars and race off back home.
diversion ... confusion ... obfuscation ... distraction ... he's taken to the coast, gets on a friendly fishing boat out into open waters and transfers to an Equiaorian vessel.
Edit: or he just remains in the embassy and we all watch while laughing our ass off!

Ugh. Open waters? ""Equiaorian vessels""?

&gt; The mob should slowly trickle into the building over a period of days. Eventually about 500 of them.
They all shave their heads, as does Assange, then - BOOM! 500 matching people come rushing out. Some should wear exaggerated make-up to baffle facial recognition cameras. Some should adopt odd walks and quirks (lean to one side a bit, limp a little, etc) to foil canter recognition software. Others behave quite normally and don't wear any make-up at all. Some wear those big annoying looking sunglasses.
Simultaneously, from nearby streets and surrounding areas, about 500 more people appear out of nowhere, also shaved. They rush towards the embassy as the other 500 rush out simultaneously. Everyone converges, mingles, runs and zig-zags.
300 or so pile into nearby cars that have been parked on the surrounding streets. Some leave alone, some share vehicles. Several get on bicycles and motorcycles. Rollerblades and skateboards. Several get into cabs and some go into the Underground on trains heading in all directions. Roaches! Roaches scurrying like the kitchen lights were just switched on. Some vehicles are right next to the embassy, some as far as several blocks away.
Another 300 or so remain lingering in the area waiting for a cue. Suddenly, about 5 minutes into the event (just as the Feds start trying to get their shit together) the second wave disperse - running to nearby buildings and vehicles. Wave two of roaches.
Mind you, about 400 remain in the immediate area. 600 have now left in two waves. Zigzagging everywhere. The remaining 400 drift off in all directions in a slow wander. Some into nearby buildings and businesses. A call is put out to the public:
""If you support Assange, shave your heads immediately. Show your support! In Bristol, in Liverpool, in Scotland and Wales. Shave your head, and go outside and mill about. Fly, my monkeys, fly!!""
Project Spartacus!


Ugh - fucking Spartacus? Really?
And helicopters. Yes, they want helicopters. Assange is going to climb into a helicopter to escape, according to Reddit.


&gt; I've been thinking this for a while, and I don't know why nobody else has suggested it, but I think all they would need to do is to charter a helicopter into the country, drop down a ladder or something to Assange on the roof of the embassy, then fly him out over the channel either here to Ireland or to somewhere on the continent. They can deliver him to an airport, throw him on a plane, and drop him in Equador. Once outside of England, the British have no authority, and if there's a bird in the air with Assange on it, the Brits would have to shoot the helicopter down to stop him, which would be an act of war, or international incident in the least...That's how I'd get him out.


Yeah, cause people can just get helicopters and fly them over central London without approval, cause that's how air traffic laws work.


&gt; I know this is far fetched, but... What would happen, if a helicopter came, and he crawled up a ladder to the copter. And then it went for an airfield, where he could get into a plane. And literary didn't touch the ground of the English soil?
Could that be done in theory?
Don't worry, I know how fucking stupid and movie like it sounds... But I'm curious, could it be done?

It could be done in theory, if Britain had no laws regarding their airspace.

&gt; Assange is probably reading this.
Whats up Julian.
Helicopter Nigger.
International Waters.


Ugh.

Basically, Reddit seems to be full of kommandos who think they can outfox a first world government and break the law. Let me break it down: the Ecuadorian embassy is protected under international law. Diplomatic bags are protected, and embassy officials are protected. The minute Assange steps out of the embassy, he isn't protected. The ""flash mobbers"" causing a massive disturbance outside of the embassy aren't immune. Helicopters and airplanes would be flying through British airspace, and aren't immune. Airports aren't immune. You can't magically get a helicopter over the center of London without some sort of approval.

This is definitely not a loaded question but whatever, it's askreddit so you can't expect too much from it.  Let's hope the comments are better.

Well, first we see someone who's [dad is a police officer](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xv4g7/i_was_just_nearly_arrested_why_do_some_people/c5pwdu0) explain what it is actually like to be a cop when they aren't shooting ever weed smoker with their M16s from the safety of their military grade tanks.  Apparently it is actually a really stressful job, what with the fear of getting shot and being a first-responder and dealing with all that comes with that, and generally having to deal with a fuck-load of shit.  So naturally he is downvoted and told to get off his high-horse because 
&gt; In fact, it's not even the most dangerous or the most stressful [job]. 

So obviously since it isn't the most dangerous or the most stressful all cops are fascist pig-scum. 

Next up we see the superiority complex found in most redditors, whereby they [know the law better than cops](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xv4g7/i_was_just_nearly_arrested_why_do_some_people/c5pu35e).  Because cops know nothing about the law and only left Doughnut Man because they wanted to harass some innoc[ent] le weed smokers, and you know, aren't trying to enforce the law at all.

And now we have an [anecdote that doesn't even make sense](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xv4g7/i_was_just_nearly_arrested_why_do_some_people/c5pvs4z).

Plain clothes officers kicking in a door?  I'm sorry but pretty much anyone kicking in a door would be clothed in SWAT gear since they would be carrying out either an arrest warrant or a search warrant.  A plain clothes officer will not bust down a door in the manner described because for that to be legal, he would have had to either seen something to give him probable cause to search the house, or believe whoever is inside is disposing of evidence of a crime.  Secondly, he says that he opened fire on 
&gt;what he probably thought were robbers

Either his friend has the reactions faster than the Flash, or his friend was sitting in his living room with a gun at the ready.  Also this story is devoid of any sort of context as to why they kicked down his door.  Was he smoking a joint? Was he a major pusher with 800 kilos of weed in his guest bedroom? Who knows.  But the poster did intentionally leave that detail out.

I'm writing this mainly because I'm sick of all the uninformed bullshit that reddit is spouting as more and more of these leaks are uncovered. This is not going to really be about the NSA spying itself but more the fact that reddit is not as technologically competent as it thinks. I don't work in the tech industry but I do read a lot of tech news and tinker a lot with various devices so I generally know what I'm talking about. Reddit however does not. Let's dive into a post.

[Revealed: how Microsoft handed the NSA access to encrypted messages, including Skype and Outlook](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i3g8n/revealed_how_microsoft_handed_the_nsa_access_to/) is the title of the discussion thread posted in /r/technology. Now for anybody who is informed about this stuff security experts have long been sceptical about Skype and it's encryption, it's also been fairly common knowledge that Microsoft can listen in on any conversation it wants. Let's see how reddit reacts to the news.

&gt;The NSA has killed the US Tech Industry. Everyday there are more and more calls to stop using products and services of American companies.

http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i3g8n/revealed_how_microsoft_handed_the_nsa_access_to/cb0me7a

And so it begins with the top comment currently at +718. Yes that's right folks the US tech industry is now well and officially dead. You heard it here first. It doesn't matter that Google (the world's largest search engine and website), Apple (the world's richest company, supplier of more high-end smartphones and tablets than anyone else) and Microsoft (the world's most used OS by consumers, businesses and governments) are all US companies. They are now all dead. 

Surely somebody will come a tone down the hyperbole a little in a reply.

&gt;I've thought this from the beginning. While it sucks for the American public, the real losers here is the US tech industry.

http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i3g8n/revealed_how_microsoft_handed_the_nsa_access_to/cb0pe4v

Nope. I was almost hopeful. The reply to this comment does have somebody with a few braincells still alive as they ask what are the alternatives.

&gt;Now we know why they are hunting Snowden. These corporations-government secret connections are the apex of greed, making each one of these companies to lie to all of their consumers about their privacy. They all might be judged by the laws of each country over indisputable evidence.

&gt;This is the culmination of political greed, economical greed, intelligence greed... they just seemed unable to stop, like a crack addict crumbling over itself.

&gt;The only exit for trusting information technology again is the open-source, to know what is in the code, for countries to analyse it, for private companies to trust it. Total transparency. And that might be the end for proprietary software companies.

http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i3g8n/revealed_how_microsoft_handed_the_nsa_access_to/cb0pnf0

Can't have an NSA thread without some conspiritards. This made me chuckle a lot. They're not stopping Snowden because he's leaking state secrets everywhere and embarrassing the US government immensely. They're not trying to stop him to ensure he doesn't fuck everything up a lot more. Nope, it's because the government's corporate overlords have told them so. 

I love the last point involving open-source, kind of adds on the jerk a little there. It may just well be the year of desktop linux people! Software companies that sell software are going extinct! Just you wait!

Next we have a new jerk. XBone hate! We can't have a thread about Microsoft without mentioning XBone!

&gt;""Skype, which was bought by Microsoft in October 2011, worked with intelligence agencies last year to allow Prism to collect video of conversations as well as audio""

&gt;So this will probably happen with Kinect on the Xbox One?

&gt;The Xbox One uses Skype.

http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i3g8n/revealed_how_microsoft_handed_the_nsa_access_to/cb0m9di

Followed by: 

&gt;The whole company is a fucking joke

 _

&gt;Microsoft: When Xbox One is on and you’re simply having a conversation in your living room, your conversation is not being recorded or uploaded.

&gt;I very much doubt that. People need to realise the kinect is an NSA program for mass data collection

Yes the kinect is literally only there to collect data for the NSA. It's not a pretty cool little gadget expanding motion capture technology so one day we can do things hands free. It's only for the NSA to track us.

Fortunately somebody has realised just how stupid this statement is and corrected them.

Finally we have:

&gt;Yeah, but is anyone going to use the Xbox One? Especially considering how much better the PS4 is.

They just assume nobody wants the pretty cool media centre functions and exclusive games.


Moving on to another top level reply.

&gt;I used to write games for the XBox360 and one of the TCRs for XBLA games is that you cannot do any encryption or compression on the voice chat data for online games. We could have compressed the crap out of them and saved a ton of bandwidth but I guess if we did that then the NSA would have to figure out the compression/encryption on each game.

Now I am not a programmer (I've dabbled) but I'm fairly sure they will want everybody using the same standard for voice chat so it isn't incredibly buggy when developers use their own home made chat functions, also the chat is compressed anyway, saving bandwidth. It's also probably something to do with MS being able to police their own chat channels. I seriously doubt it has anything to do with the NSA intercepting voice chat.

New top reply.

We have a guy, very rightly, talking about the privacy ramifications of using Office 2013's skydrive feature. A lot of companies are going to be wary about storing anything in ""the cloud"" anyway, let alone on a US server that the NSA and MS is known to have backdoor access to. It's nice to be having some proper debate about this for once. Wait what's that? More hyperbole? Of course.

&gt;if you want security and freedom from spying you shouldn't use Windows.

That's right, if you don't want to be spied on don't use Windows. There is so much wrong with this. Windows is the most widely used piece of software in the world, it is used by the vast majority of consumers, businesses and governments across the world. This ensures that it is also the most scutinised piece of software in the world. Thousands of security experts, hackers and government agencies have crawled over the OS with a fine-toothed comb and found nothing. If there was some kind of backdoor it would have been found. 

Next top level comment is started with the phrase ""would you like to know more?"" which for some annoys the hell out of me (perhaps because reddit uses it far far too much) and is full of lots of links and dubious conclusions. I'm not going to post it because I'm too lazy too format it but I will pick out some points.

http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i3g8n/revealed_how_microsoft_handed_the_nsa_access_to/cb0osur

&gt;How Can Any Company Ever Trust Microsoft Again? ""Microsoft consciously and regularly passes on information about how to break into its products to US agencies""

Linking to an /r/technology thread with an article of the same title. Something similar was posted in /r/technology a few days ago and it was mentioned by a lot of people (including me) that the reason MS gives early warning to security agencies about bugs in its software is to help them mitigate vulnerabilities. In fact they give it to [civilian security software vendors](https://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/collaboration/mapp.aspx#) and large companies too! But of course there's a conspiracy.

&gt;NSA helped with Windows 7 development

&gt;Privacy expert voices 'backdoor' concerns, security researchers dismiss idea

Another claim here, the NSA did help but they help out with a lot of software that they and other US government agencies use, again for reasons of security. Privacy ""experts"" that voiced backdoor concerns were shot down by actual experts because of the reasons I've detailed above.

&gt;It's Terrifying And Sickening That Microsoft Can Now Listen In On All My Skype Calls

It's also [common knowledge](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/think-your-skype-messages-get-end-to-end-encryption-think-again/) to anybody who has done the slightest bit of research.


Next TLC.

&gt;This basically confirms that the always on kinect on the xboxone is an NSA program! 

Again, it's not a cool tech device that MS thought everybody would like using. It's a 1984 telescreen (as the comment below helpfully pointed out).


So to sum up we have:

* The US tech industry is dead.

* Conspiritards and their theories about corporations and the government

* XBone hate

* Kinect is literally a 1984 telescreen

* General MS hate

* Year of Desktop Linux (surely after thirteen years it's going to happen!)

* NSA built backdoors in Windows

&gt;...but the moment you take in things that are forced by the Islamic culture upon ""natives"" the lack of identity is justifiable.

(I can list quite a few sadly enough)

However, most of the comments on [r/WorldNews](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/) don't reflect that. They don't really focus on the tragedy of the deaths of innocents, or the political causes and consequences of the situation at hand.

If this was a year or so ago, all they would care about would be calling the Israelis fascist murderers.

Now, however, the anti-anti-Israeli counterjerk has properly come into its own.

Traits include taking quotes out of context:

&gt; ""Three Israeli people have been killed"" ""Eleven Palestinians - mainly militants but also children - have been killed""

&gt; Biased much, BBC?

Or attacking the lamestream media:

&gt; Yes, let's find a way to make the Israelis look like the bad guys in this situation.

and...

&gt; I'm disgusted by how the main media doesn't bring that side of the story up, ever.

Yeah, because the media has literally *never* brought up the deaths of innocent Isralis, if by never, you discount several articles that can be found on the websites of the BBC, CNN, CBS, Reuters, et cetera. People also love expecting downvotes from the Arab-lovers - downvotes that don't arrive.

&gt; The rockets have killed people now. These people couldn't make it to a bunker in time.

&gt; That's what you all wanted.

&gt; Do you give a shit now, you pseudo-liberal fucks?

Yeah, because that's what we wanted.

&gt; You validate Hamas' tactics. You are partly responsible for their deaths.

and...

&gt; i'm sure people will find a way to spin this against israel. the big evil aggressor destroying innocent missiles that just want to live in peace

and...

&gt; The Zionists put those buildings in the way of innocent, harmless Palestinian rockets!

And it goes on and on.

Don't get me wrong - there are tons of the anti-Israeli assholes as well, but they are mainly getting buried by the wave of pro-Israeli sentiment.

Even if you believe that Israel has the complete right to retaliate - and that is a completely legitimate belief - or you believe that the Palestinians actions are understandable given the fact that they have had their land continuously taken from them - once again, a legitimate belief - pretty much everybody can admit that the Israeli-Palistinian issue is a multifaceted and delicate conflict. Everybody except for assholes, that is. Unfortunately, [r/WorldNews](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/) is full of assholes who love a good jerk.

**EDIT**: I realize that I didn't include specific threads. They aren't hard to find - just look on the frontpage. Some of them are:

All of them are perfectly news-worthy. It's just that the comments don't actually discuss the news - they are just jerks of idiots yelling at each other. 

**EDIT**: some people have pointed out some clearly anti-Israeli comments that have been upvoted since I made this post. I definitely agree that the anti-Israel jerk is far from dead. Rather, my point is that we have basically evolved to have two competing jerks. Of course, this is basically what exists in real life in the region (except we don't have explosives on Reddit).

I don't know if this was the inception of the jerk but it is definitely very inspired by [this](http://www.titaniumteddybear.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/stephen-fry-on-being-offended.jpg) Stephen Fry quote. I don't have a problem with the quote itself. Fry is right and, as a comedian, probably has to deal with the annoyance of people complaining about his jokes all the time. The problem is that most redditors seem to take this argument as an excuse to say something like ""God is a nigger, faggot"" to someone--or dress up in unfunny and obviously offensive costumes--and then, when someone gets offended (because offending them was the point the whole time), get really self-righteous and argue about how they're actually in the right to say these things and that anyone who complains about offensiveness is just an idiot.

Even granting that their logic is sound and people should never be offended by anything, the fact still remains that people are going to be offended by things and, unless you're some edgy, counter-cultural drifter who isn't worried about having any friends, it's in your best interest to respect this fact. If there is a non-offensive way to present a point, that's probably the best way to go about doing it. 

I'm not saying that there is anything objectively offensive but a socially conscious person should be able to tell what their audience may find offensive.

""Why is Amanda Todd Different from the Other People Who Commit Suicide Daily?""

I know, I know; I was stupid and just *had* to click it. Now my night is ruined. Why?

&gt; She turned it into a publicity stunt. Yes it's horrible. Yes bullying's bad. Yes, nobody deserves to be treated in such a way. But there are more efficient ways of dealing with the situation than killing herself, it was completely unnecessary. There are more tragic stories that get way less attention, but deserve way more.

Ah, yes, because a high school girl is going to think, ""Y'know, killing myself doesn't really seem all that efficient.""

&gt; Let's take one more step back, and realize how dangerous and irresponsible to do the things that caused the bullying. There's no way she didn't know that what she was doing was child pornography and wrong. Don't get me wrong, bullying is wrong, and the alleged beating her up is horrible, and they took it way too far, but she also wasn't very smart about it, either.

Again, because a 7th grade girl is going to think about the consequences of the future. Also: didn't the guy basically stalk her and take a year to find her and start blackmailing her?

&gt; Unfortunately a lot of girls don't feel like there options are bigger then what's In front of them. It's a sad story hope so one can reach out to people that are need it by hearing it.

DAE THINK GIRLS ONLY DATE ASSHOLES?!?

&gt; Because she turned her death into a publicity stunt and the media bit. Truth be told, I have no sympathy for the girl. Everything that happened to her was the result of her own actions. She CHOSE to flash her breasts over the internet. She CHOSE to sleep with a guy who had a girlfriend. Did she think that the other girl was just going to shrug it off when she found out?

Again, because 7th grade girls are *totally* thinking, ""Hey, better watch out; don't want to get stalked!"" 

&gt; That's your opinion. You are entitled to it. I'm just being a realist. I lack sympathy for the human death, as in this case, when the aforementioned human does it to themselves. She did kill herself, right? She chose that.

I can't....I can't go on....

&gt; She also knew she was underage, a minor.

But...

&gt; Could she honestly have been any more naive? They called her beautiful and all that because they wanted to see her breasts.

STOP.

I can't believe how short-sighted Reddit is some days. I mean, I know, we see this every single day, on /r/atheism and /r/politics and /r/askreddit and /r/funny and god knows where else. 

Does anybody on this site even remember what it's like to be in 7th grade, never mind a 7th grade girl? Why do you think so many people start getting into eating disorders and such at that age? Is that the next thing I'm going to be seeing on this site? ""Bitch starved herself? SHE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN TO EAT HEALTHY.""

You're the fucking parent here. Set a limit on how much he can play, and push his ass outside.

Because this redditor is obviously a parent.

1376040872.0,84,self.circlebroke,1k0mhj,A Subreddit-wide Jerk: An Analysis of TIL and discussion of how to accurately describe implicit jerks and jerks of omission,code_primate,102,18,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1k0mhj/a_subredditwide_jerk_an_analysis_of_til_and/,"This post began as a planned comment to another CBer in a different thread, but I think this warrants its own comment.

There are lots of jerks on Reddit. That's why we're here, and we all agree on that fact. One of the things that bug me most, though are jerks of subtext. I assume you know the feeling: Reddit starts talking about something tangentially related to an issue it's passionate about. They bring up points that are, when read plainly, true and seemingly uncontroversial, but something is definitely off. Sometimes it's when they congratulate each other for incredibly banal beliefs that one must wonder if they have actually deluded themselves into actually thinking their enemies are a goofily evil hyperbolic caricature. For example, something like ""Wow, the world would be so much better if we had more people like you who thought that people of all genders deserve equal rights,"" almost always implies that feminists actually want to subjugate men to achieve their goals, etc. Other times, it is simply odd patterns in the frequency of posts. For example, by itself, the recent /r/AskReddit post asking for stories from male rape survivors was pretty good and focuses on a topic often overlooked by mainstream society. Understanding the context of Reddit, however, one wonders why Reddit expresses such deep concern for male rape victims, but we have not seen a high-ranking thread about female rape victims (who are the vast, vast majority of rape victims) since some people tried to do damage control after the Ask-a-Rapist fallout. Indeed, a simple search of ""male rape"" and ""female rape"" on AskReddit reveals the thread so clearly that additional commentary is barely needed. Indeed, Reddit's concern for male rape victims quickly starts to seem like concern trolling when one knows how vehemently they refute any mention of the well-documented male-on-female epidemic of sexual violence. (sorry to use 2 SJ examples. I know it's not open broke, but these were particularly illustrative)

I consider these previous paragraphs to be the beginnings of a discussion on reddit's jerks of omission and jerks of subtext. I have not fully considered the implications and would love to hear what you all have to say, but somehow the idea of Redditors smugly upvoting something that indirectly validates their bizarre worldview makes me angrier than seeing a blatantly sensationalist /r/politics post. I would like to attempt to analyze /r/TIL for jerks of subtext.

TIL is poised to become one of the new worst of reddit subreddits. The thing is that the jerk is usually implicit. In TIL, I think there are four main categories of subtextually jerky posts. There are thinly-veiled political issues brought up with a relevant ""fact,"" some ""statistics"" or stories playing into Reddit's worldview (especially with regard to minorities or women), mentions of things/people Reddit idolizing that rise on name recognition that appeal to people who already probably know the fact, and stories about ""badassery"". I venture that these categories make up &gt;85% of TIL. 

If you look at the top of TIL right now (and this is honestly amazing to me since I came up with 3/4 of my TIL categories off the top of my head before looking at the front page), the top several posts all fit into those categories perfectly. 

The [first link](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jz9xc/til_phil_hartman_you_may_remember_him_in_such/) combines both reddit's incessant pandering to fans of one of its favorite aspects of pop culture (Futurama), but also the not-so-subtle revival of the ""crazy girlfriend"" jerk, which gets prominent mention because of the ""murdered by his wife"" line in the title. Unsurprisingly, we get comments like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jz9xc/til_phil_hartman_you_may_remember_him_in_such/cbjwrth) (TL;DR, ""what a crazy b----"") as well as general jerking over how good he was by people who are obviously big fans and did not learn today about his death. It's tough to tell whether the ""crazy woman"" jerk or ""pop culture I like"" jerk contributed more to its success, and my categorization admittedly forces it to straddle at least two categories, but once again, it is hard to tell since much of the jerk is subtextual. 

The [second link](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jzweu/til_under_civil_forfeiture_police_departments_are/) is a straight up corrupt cop jerk. There have been interesting articles in the mainstream news about this very real issue, but Reddit seems to forget that it was heavily abused in a few municipalities rather than a nationwide conspiracy. You have your standard cop hate and shitthatneverhappened.txt anti-cop stories, and it's not even worth mentioning here. This is pretty clearly the political view category.

[More jerking about against a political view](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jz498/til_companies_can_still_legally_fire_a_worker_for/) that, while a good thing to oppose, is almost certainly known by everyone who upvoted it, as equal protection has been the big quest for LGBT equality cases for years.

Fifth is a post where reddit [praises a cop murderer for trying to donate a pizza](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jyyxa/til_that_copkiller_philip_workman_declined_a_last/). I find this post extremely illustrative. Interestingly, the comments are suggesting that he may not have been the killer. I'm not interested enough to read enough to tell if this is reasonable or not, and reddit certainly idolizes cop killers enough that it wouldn't need to argue their innocence to support them (DAE Dorner?), but this is irrelevant. Why? We can reasonably assume from the 100-10-1 rule that most people did not read the comments. Yet people still upvoted the story based on a calculated portrayal of a ""cop-killer"" who tried to do a good deed but got shut down by the system. We don't need to get into any of the politics of capital punishment or the details of the evidence of this specific man's innocence to see that this is clearly part of the bizarre ""cop murderers are good/cops deserve to die"" jerk that has been full-force in the background since Dorner and occasionally resurfaces. To leave no doubt in your mind about this, the OP responds to [this](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jyyxa/til_that_copkiller_philip_workman_declined_a_last/cbjq2r3) comment with [this](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1jyyxa/til_that_copkiller_philip_workman_declined_a_last/cbjua0x). I think what I am getting at here is that while we usually focus on jerks in the comments, the jerks implicit in the upvotes given to main submissions are also extremely powerful, and we have only scratched the surface of this phenomenon on CB. More on this later.

And below that you have mildly interesting things that lack the jerk power to propel them to the top of TIL, except in a few exceptions.

So I guess I'm trying to address three things with this post: Jerks through link posts, subtextual jerks, and jerks of omission. Most of the TIL examples are subtextual jerk examples. The subtext is very clear for why Reddit should upvote them. And while the comments may even call them out, it doesn't matter since an entirely different group of people accept and upvote the sensationalized titles at face value! Upvoting a thinly-veiled political opinion in TIL is no less jerky than doing so for comments in /r/politics, although it has been extremely difficult for CB to quantify or analyze these jerks in the past. I took a stab at it here, and maybe there is some prior art for this, but I'd love to hear all of your ideas. I think the jerks of omission are even harder to spot, since they involve an intimate knowledge of Reddit's jerks and what important things you've never seen come up over the past several months, but once again they often take place outside the comment section.

When I read the ""He must be rich right?"" I thought he was gonna call them on their bullshit but nope, he's joining in. THE ONLY WAY HE CAN MAKE SENSE OF THIS HUGE MYSTERY OF HOW A FATTY GOT A GIRL IS HE MUST BE RICH OR GAINED WEIGHT! NO WAY THEY COULD JUST ACTUALLY LOVE EACH OTHER!

This is a fucking joke right? One picture of a woman with her family and he has her figured out. Judging from his other comments I doubt he's joking. It can't get worse than this though... right?

&gt;She's not a looker, but he's got eyes spread farther than your mother's legs at the sight of a $10 bill.

&gt;Not saying she's a catch, she's certainly below my standards

1/10 would not bang. Going through this guy's history there is constant Nigger-bashing so I'm sure he is just an upstanding beautiful human who don't need no woman.

&gt;Disagree about that, but she's not all that attractive. Look at her saggy tits. She's probably got an unattractive ass too. People think she's attractive because she's got a nice face and isn't fat. That's not all there is. I award her a 5/10.

Wow, what a story!  A prominent conservative comes out in favor of gay marriage due to his son being gay.  This could create shockwaves in politics about gay rights, so who better than to analyze the situation than /r/politics, right?

Top Comment:

&gt; Too bad GOP senators never have sons who come out as poor.

Well... that just doesn't help matters at all.  Maybe there's some thoughtfulness below.  What's number 2?

&gt; As a gay man, this upset me at first. Then I remembered Harvey Milk. He argued that if every gay person would just come out of the closet, everybody around them would realize that they are not insane or evil, and that they deserve to be happy. This story proves Milk right.

Well, I don't know if I agree, but it's a thoughtful reply, can't deny that.  But he doesn't really explain why it upset him at first.  Let's see what's behind door #3.

Hopefully he can convince some of his colleagues, and say ""look, I have a gay kid and it changed my mind. If you had a gay kid it would change yours...but it shouldn't matter about your kids.

Turns out it's as strong as ever!

Link to the thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/16oj11/cop_kicks_man_5_times_in_the_head_thinking_he_was/

The video depicts a man being kicked in the head by a cop while being subdued. Apparently, the man isn't even drunk, he's having a hyperglycemic fit. 

Granted, the actions of the policeman are way out of line - criminal, even. But criticising one cop or a group of cops isn't enough for reddit, oh no!

Let's get right into the jerkin':

&gt;5 cops to subdue a man in going into shock? Fuck cops and everything about them.

+88. All cops are bad, no cops are good.

&gt;Reddit once again proving my unpopular opinion that, COPS FUCKING SUCK.

+18. Because it's not like there are any videos where cops are being good people, ever. 

&gt;You fucking liberals in here. The cop was obviously defending his freedom in self defense.

+6. Touché! Fine sarcasm! Obviously all non-liberals agree with this policeman's actions.

&gt;Most cops are good people.

This outrageous comment was awarded with net downvotes (currently sitting at -2 with +53/-55):

And finally, the cherry on my reddit daiquiri:

&gt;And was the gun really necessary? Even if it was a drunk person, are you really going to shoot him? No wonder people want to arm themselves, I would too if the police were this repressive.

+67. Yes, because PULLING A GUN on a cop is real likely to end well! Somehow, they managed to pull in a pro-gun jerk inside an anti-cop jerk.

In conclusion, what does reddit think about cops? They suck, and this fact is obviously proven by the handful of videos displaying bad conduct. Don't get me wrong, I want to see cops doing this punished severely, and steps should be taken so this behaviour is never tolerated - however, that doesn't mean I instantly see all cops as monsters.

The SimCity dev team pops in to [field some questions concerning their new product](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14umm1/we_are_the_simcity_dev_team_from_maxis_amaa/). The top comment (1197):

&gt;What will happen to the game if I am playing and lose my internet connection - will the game still be playable and update the servers when my internet connection resumes or will it pause and wait for the connection?

&gt;As I have unreliable internet at times if I were to lose a connection and play for a while longer (assuming I would be able to continue to play) would my changes be saved locally in case my internet connection does not come back up before I need to stop playing (and then be uploaded when I next start the game).

&gt;I love what the game is looking like and look forward to the multi-player region games, but as you can tell I am concerned about what happens if my internet connection decides to drop for a few hours.

A valid, albeit unfascinating question. 

What ensues is a monster of a thread, wherein DRM schemes are identified as *literally* the final solution. An online-only game would be strictly speaking **evil incarnate.**

Granted, as far as I can tell, this question is not one that the dev team has much to do with, they field it to their engineers and the official answer gets lost in the shuffle (369):

&gt;""I actually just ran over to our online engineering team to get the latest info. We do handle ""short"" internet outages gracefully. Meaning, if your internet goes out while you're logged in and playing the game, we can can recover gracefully. You shouldn't notice a thing. ""Short"" is still being defined."" 

Of course, receiving far more delicious karma is a life-long fan of the Sim City franchise forever disavowing this vile company and its DRM. He must end that precious relationship (963+ REDDIT GOLD):

&gt;Not to be rude to your or any of your team, since you've very obviously put a ton of work into this game, but please let your higher ups and ""business types"" know that this kind of DRM is completely unacceptable to gamers. I am a huge simcity fan and have purchased alomst every Maxis and SimCity game since SimCity 2000 but hearing this news is a completely turnoff. I refuse to be punished for purchasing a game, and that's what this DRM is, punishment. If you have any kind of connectivity issues and wish to play a game that has been targeted at single player types you are punished despite shelling out whatever money for this game. Pirates will continue to pirate and come up with a way around this nonsense and your paying customers are left punished. Please reconsider this system for the sake of your fans as well as gaming as whole.

For reasons unknown, this fellow gets 262 upvotes just for asking what DRM is in an incredulous manner (bonus for use of the word ""fuck""):

&gt;I haven't been paying attention. Sim City now requires a constant internet connection? What the fuck for?

What follows are **pages** of comments decrying the vile gods of DRM. 

Maybe once its out of their system, an interesting question or two about the complexities of game development can occur. 

Nope! It's an inside joke, ha ha! (albeit a relevant one 402):

&gt;Will there be splines needing reticulation?

Question after question regarding DRM schemes and EA (literally hitler) follows.

Her description of why she does it was the first thing that started to raise some flags:
&gt;I am aware that this makes me a 'piece of shit' and that I have no couth or character. I don't really care, obviously. But, if they don't want people faking, they need to make it harder to do so.

Right off the bat she's saying she's not to blame, the law is. This is no different from the Reddit hivemind's thinking about ""If you don't want us to pirate games then make them cheaper!""

Guy posts a pic of his premature niece in the ICU alongside a picture of her at her 1st birthday and proceeds to call her his hero, which pisses of the sociopaths that frequent this place.

&gt;Not to belittle the result, because that is fantastic, but how were her actions heroic? As a baby, she simply continued to eat, sleep, and poop, and provided no conscious decision to will harder to survive, nor did she take any action to further her life. If anything, the doctors who worked on her to save her should be your heroes.

""Not to belittle your one year old niece, but she's worthless and did nothing."" What the fuck, Reddit? Currently sitting at +247, probably from the power of the tacked-on STEM jerk at the end.

&gt;all the doctors and nurses had something to do with it too i think

No, really? Sheeit, I never would have known that if you hadn't told me and got 122 other members of the STEM jerk to join in. Why stop there? I'm pretty sure the guy that fixed the doctor's car so he could get to work on time had a hand in it. Also, the maintenance man in the anesthesiologist's apartment building installed the new faucet so the dripping sound didn't keep the good doctor up late again. So he gets a point too, right?

A few people call Reddit out on being dickwads about the usage of the word ""hero""...

&gt;ITT: People way too touchy about the word 'hero'.

&gt;Wow so many people ragging on you for saying she's your hero. This teeny tiny little child survived despite being dealt a pretty shitty hand and with the odds against her. Maybe that's not ""heroic"" but it's certainly inspirational and I'm sure that's what OP meant, that his niece is an inspiration to him and a reminder to appreciate life.

LOL at a Redditor appreciating life. That takes effort and the willingness to leave the circle. ""I'm not blueballing myself when there's a science post to fap around!""

&gt;Well, it really, really doesn't make sense the way OP used it.
It would be like saying, my 5 year old nephew fell off a cliff while hiking and didn't die, he's my hero!

...and what's wrong with that? Oh, I know what...

It's not the DICTIONARY definition of hero, lovingly provided here...

&gt;he·ro
/ˈhi(ə)rō/ Noun A person, typically a man, who is admired for courage or noble qualities. The chief male character in a book, play, or movie, who is typically identified with good qualities. &gt;Synonyms character
&gt;HAS TO BE A MAN^

By the same person that gives us THIS gem:

&gt;THAT BABY IS NOT A FUCKING HERO, JEBUZ CHRIST HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT YOU BITCH, LE REDDIT WILL MAKE YOU P@Y Dearly

Yes. Reddit will make you pay... by inundating you with fake internet minus points. Pathetic.

Oh, of course, there also has to be a ""baby month year"" jerk in there too...

&gt;That's 6 months and a half, boys. JUST SAY THE MONTHS.

If you can't mentally convert 26 weeks without effort, you should not be on the internet. You should not own a car. You should not have a job. You should not be allowed outside of your house. If you are a grown-ass adult with no degenerative mental diseases or birth defects, you should not need someone spoonfeeding you how many weeks go into how many months. If you are so stupid that you do not know why a child's life is measured first in weeks, then in months, then in years... well, chances are you're a worthless basement-dwelling pustule who's never been around a baby and will never (thank SCIENCE!) have the chance to make one.

1373668823.0,81,self.circlebroke,1i6o4q,"Any sufficiently relevant issue is, to r/technology, indistinguishable from privacy.",WellThisWentWell,100,19,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1i6o4q/any_sufficiently_relevant_issue_is_to_rtechnology/,"This is my first time posting in /r/circlebroke, but I have been reading posts here for a while. Most posts here seem to focus on a particular post in a sub, analyzing the jerks that come out of it. Those are great, and usually super entertaining, but I think that something that often gets overlooked is the overall *content* of subs. After all, a huge number of Reddit visitors don't bother looking at comments, and another slightly less huge number don't bother looking past the defaults. Therefore, the overall identity of Reddit to many people is often inferred by the top few links in the default subs. So today I'd like to examine what jerks those links reveal by focusing on /r/technology.

/r/news and /r/politics are hot-spots for the ""NSA IS [le]TERALLY HITLER"" jerk. We all know that. But at least that makes a little sense. Edwrd Snowden is making news, and he is relevant to the political system, so he is expected to be jerked over in those subs. But to truly appreciate the size and scope of the anti-surveillance jerk, and to therefore understand that Reddit is made up of largely young white males that spend too much time on the internet and have no real problems to be concerned with, you need to check out subs where it is thoroughly irrelevant. A sub like /r/technology.

Let's start by looking at [the new queue](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/new/). At the time of this writing, the 25 newest posts feature **five** links related to either internet privacy. **Two** of those are really only tangentially related, since they focus on the technology used by Edward Snowden to send covert emails. But their inclusion is still indicative of the ""Edward Snowden = George Washington + James Bond + every martyr ever"" jerk.

That's only a 20% ""NSA = Big Brother = Technology"" rate though. Arguably it's less, since a couple of those posts *actually focus on technology*, rather than just the INARGUABLE FACT THAT OBAMA WIPES HIS ASS WITH THE CONSTITUTION. 

But that's not where the jerk presents itself. It presents itself in the posts which the /r/technology community consider most germane to issues concerning... well... technology--those that get upvoted the most. So lets check out the top scoring links of the day:

* [HP GIVES NSA ALL DATA THEY STORE ON A SILVER PLATTER](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i58vx/hp_keeps_installing_secret_backdoors_in/)

* [GOOGLE MOUNTS GLORIOUS STAND AGAINST GOVERNMENT TRYING TO DELETE INTERNET](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i5wrr/google_refuses_to_delete_pirate_websites_from_its/) ... But look inside for a nice anti-corporations jerk.

* [NSA TRIES TO ""OWN"" (more like 'pwn', amirite?)THE INTERNET""] (http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i5hgb/forget_prism_fairview_is_the_nsas_project_to_own/).

* [TWITTER SET TO EXTERMINATE ALL NON-SHEEPLE](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i5iy8/twitter_agrees_to_reveal_the_names_of_people_who/).

* [US GOVERNMENT FORCES AUSTRALIA TO BE ASSIST IN CREATING GLOIBAL POLICE STATE](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i4t42/australian_telco_telstra_storing_data_on_behalf/). For some reason there is a really antisemitic comment on that right [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i4t42/australian_telco_telstra_storing_data_on_behalf/cb1e85g). Currently it's at +1, so it'll probably be downvoted pretty soon...

Those are 6 of the top 10 posts from today. That's right: Technology is 60% about a person's right to be racist on Twitter, [10% about a person's right to steal](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i5b05/convicted_music_pirate_jammie_thomas_who_owes_the/), [10% world news](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i5tel/another_boeing_787_catches_fire_in_london/), [10% Marketing](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i51s4/google_is_about_to_spend_half_of_apples_annual/)... And only [10 fucking percent about actual technology](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i40ci/developer_hacks_microwave_into_the_microwave_of/).

I'm sure there's an argument to be made that internet privacy policy falls under the sub's guidelines that content must be ""on technology (news, updates, political policies, etc.)"" But it's a stretch at best. And even if such articles are appropriate, the idea that an article on Twitter reporting antisemitic tweets is considered more relevant to technology that [the invention of a Terminator-esque robot](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i4pkz/be_afraid_darpa_unveils_terminatorlike_atlas/) is absurd. Hell, a humanoid robot is *exactly* what I picture when I think of what ""technology"" means. 

I wanted to focus on content with this post, rather than comments. Content is really what drives a subreddit's identity, particularly a default like /r/technology. And so what do you get when you look at the top content generated by /r/technology? An entire sub focused on issues barely (if at all) related to its name, inhabited by a bunch of teenage white guys that read 1984 in freshman year and now see themselves as the last bastion of defense against the totalitarian US government.

And let me finish with [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1i5iy8/twitter_agrees_to_reveal_the_names_of_people_who/cb1d7pc), on the article which stated that Twitter would be reporting the names of racist/antisemitic users to French police:

&gt; First, it's things that you might consider racist or anti-semitic. And you'll welcome that as protection. Then, the definition of both will broaden. Then they'll add ""subversive"". Then they'll add ""critical"". Then maybe they'll add ""communist"" or ""anti-social"". Soon enough, it will be anyone who doesn't say ""That new edition of the newspeak dictionary sure is doubleplus good, eh citizen?"" And you'll never see it coming because it will be offered to you in a pleasant package.

[This](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1gj9fb/how_i_deal_with_random_photobombers/) thread is pretty gross. Two guys are taking a picture when a woman allegedly photobombs them. Rather than saying ""can you please not do that,"" or asking if the woman is trying to joke around (in a way that understandably might not be preferred), the dude just flat out shoves his hand in her face and forces her out of frame.

Now I don't know about you, but that seems pretty unnecessary. Photobombs can be annoying, especially if they're strangers trying to screw with you, but you can do it without actually putting your hands on someone, not to mention we don't even know if she was trying to be rude.

The thread's about as shitty as you can imagine what with getting physical with someone who ""deserves"" it, and her being a woman only makes it dumber.

Then it gets a new kind of shitty with a comment string making fun of being objectified because hey why the fuck not. After someone says, hold up, let me choke back this vomit, ""jeez your bearded friend is gorgeous and majestic,"" the comments following are stupid as usual.

&gt;Quit objectifying him you sexist pig

&gt;I like being objectified

&gt;Don't encourage them! If you encourage their lewdness then they will never take us men seriously as a person, and we'll never be equals in the workplace.

Basically the people over at /r/HailCorporate are super paranoid an think Reddit purposely started giving Redditers gold in top post to make people think of it as a super-upvote and start buying it for other people. This thread of course derails and there are 24 separate accounts getting gold. I found it hilarious that someone(s) actually spent almost 100$ for this joke.

Currently sitting at +160:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/19msff/wealth_inequality_in_america/

Yep, another overblown sensationalist video about the AmeriKKKan caste system that keeps brave neckbeards working their menial jobs while those Friendzoning CEO's sit back and reap their ill gotten gains. I could comment on the flaws of the video, but that's not really what this article is about. /r/Frugal is supposed to be a subreddit about making your dollar stretch further, and I've found over the past year that they do a pretty good job of it. I've found a great deal of really helpful shopping tips and possible substitutions for more expensive products. However this article is a shining example of a worrying trend of politicization sweeping across reddit.

Currently this post is sitting above hundreds of ACTUALLY RELEVANT posts and it seems like the mods are doing nothing about it. OP tries to defend himself by stating that:
&gt;The vast majority of [1] /r/frugal members are down on the extreme left side of the J curve. It gives a perspective about what we face and should give impetus to everyone's frugality efforts. If the existing economic system is stacked against you then you have to be smarter to make up for the disadvantage. R/frugal is a place to learn how to be smarter,. 

Yep. It is common knowledge in the world of economics that finding out how rich a small portion of the population is will make everyone else save more, it makes a lot of sense if you think about it. Clearly all qualms I have about this post's relevancy have been resolved!

Just in case you weren't completely convinced we're in an /r/politics thread we have some of these classic reddit staple comments:

&gt;I learned this 30 some years ago in a Sociology 101 class.
Most Americans greatly overestimate how wealthy they are and underestimate how much they need to retire.

WHELL GUYS LOOKS LIKE IT'S TIME TO BLAME OUR PARENTS FOR OUR PROBLEMS, DEFINITELY NOT SOMETHING A TEENAGER WOULD DO.

&gt;so.. you like the ""new and improved"" caste system called America?

Man, this guy's one semester of Poli-Sci is really coming in handy now. Clearly a wealth disparity means that we're on par with a system of systematic and institutionalized class structure. Genius.

/r/Politcs is best kept in /r/Politics, like /r/atheism it's working under the pretense of some manifest destiny, to settle in more subreddits and spread the word.

1346527621.0,82,self.circlebroke,z72na,Your Cheating Heart: Reddit's Infidelity Complex. ,usnero,95,13,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/z72na/your_cheating_heart_reddits_infidelity_complex/,"Askreddit has a long and cherished history of being a cry-spot for lovers spurned. Right now they have three front paged threads chronicling the extracurricular dalliances of wayward women.

First up, we have, [""I need an echo chamber to justify my behavior which is clearly childish and passive aggressive even with the limited, self-serving information I'm offering.""] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z5xae/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_and_when_people_ask/)

The OP's girlfriend cheated on him. They broke up. When people ask OP why they broke up, he pulls no punches. ""Because she cheated on me"" is his blunt response. This has gotten back to her. She has called and requested he be more diplomatic about the situation than this. 

[I really really love what inevitably results from these threads.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z5xae/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_and_when_people_ask/c61px1g) You get a little bit of everything. Misogyny, group think, confirmation bias, rampant assumptions. Everything that makes reddit reddit. And, of course, reddit's favorite past time: righteous indignation!

How side-splittingly melodramatic is that ""You owe her nothing"" line? And, to be technical, when was it ever implied that OP's ex-girlfriend thinks he owes her something?  The best I can find from his post is, ""...essentially saying that I am obligated to her not to spread this because it's no one else business."" That ""essentially"" makes it pretty clear she never brought up obligation herself, and he is giving her words a liberal butthurt interpretation. I'm personally working on the assumption that her words were closer to, ""Can you please not be a dick about this and tell people it wasn't working out or we decided to see other people or any other cliche phrase people say to reduce the number of unwitting outsiders dragged into their own personal drama?"" Actually, it probably wasn't that well-worded. I had time to mull over that line, and I'm not currently experiencing any extremes of emotion. 

Of course, Reddit seems to think she's [threatening legal action](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z5xae/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_and_when_people_ask/c61s9f0). Or, at least [planning to do the very thing we're accusing her of thinking he's doing to her](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z5xae/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_and_when_people_ask/c61qmqy). Yeah, of course she'll slander him. Because we know absolutely nothing about her except that she's a woman... oh yeah, that's all we need to know.

And let's not miss this opportunity to [demonize female sexuality](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z5xae/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_and_when_people_ask/c61rvdu).

[SRS already mentioned this for its forceful, domineering tone](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z5xae/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_and_when_people_ask/c61reeb), but what I like about this, and what brings me back to my original point, is the repetition of the word ""obligated."" The reason this person used that word is because it was in the original post. But we can all be completely positive that the girlfriend-in-question never used that word. It is completely the OP's interpretation that she thinks he's obligated to do something, and now a word she never said is being turned around on this hypothetical, [very possibly nonexistent](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z5xae/my_girlfriend_cheated_on_me_and_when_people_ask/c61sm0l) woman. 

Our next thread [ranks even higher on the DIDN'T HAPPEN chart.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z6vx2/update_im_100_sure_my_wife_is_cheating_on_me_with/). This is an update thread (these things always have update threads). In a scene right out of Cheaters, this brave hero rented a car to discretely follow his wife to the hotel where she met his best friend, checked into a room with him, and DRAMATICALLY CLOSED THE BLINDS OF THEIR ROOM, all while OP frantically took pictures and video from the rental car. Don't think too hard about how OP knew exactly which window to look in. He eventually drew her out of the room by repeatedly setting her car alarm off. She didn't come out until the third time because suspense works best in groups of threes. Of course, OP is still wondering if he can patch up his relationship because he needs to cue reddit's response board on their predictable reactions. Why even bother linking to them? They're all exactly like the last one.

Thread number 3 is a bit of a departure in that the victim is not the poster. [I think my sister is cheating on her deployed husband. What can I do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z6dy5/i_think_my_sister_is_cheating_on_her_deployed/) is also hilariously made up / written by a twelve year old and contains the funniest sentence I've ever read:

""I know what sex sounds like and I heard it: moans, whispers, that kind of stuff.""

OP KNOWS WHAT SEX SOUNDS LIKE! 

That's a relief. 

What's interesting about the viewer response to this is that, when the poster is not the victim, people are more likely to muse about the [possibility of the relationship being less than ideal](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z6dy5/i_think_my_sister_is_cheating_on_her_deployed/c61umia). It's weird how nobody gave cheating girlfriend number 1 that sort of benefit of the doubt. Instead, they preemptively accused her of making up lies to that effect. The wildly different responses in the comments sections to two basically identical stories based on the narrator's relative distance to the situation is enough by itself to discredit anonymous internet advice. So why do people still seek it? 

[As](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z6dy5/i_think_my_sister_is_cheating_on_her_deployed/c61vqio) [a](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z6dy5/i_think_my_sister_is_cheating_on_her_deployed/c61x2w5) [soldier](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z6dy5/i_think_my_sister_is_cheating_on_her_deployed/c61uf7t), [I](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z6dy5/i_think_my_sister_is_cheating_on_her_deployed/c61w2xr) [disapprove](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/z6dy5/i_think_my_sister_is_cheating_on_her_deployed/c61x531).

 


FINAL THOUGHT:

Relationships are complicated. Often times, one party will want to end the relationship but doesn't know how. Affairs are one of a slew of unsavory behaviors a person might exhibit before they are mature enough to end a relationship straight up. While this is emotionally dishonest and underhanded, treating the person like a heartless movie villain isn't any better, and one should always be willing to share the blame for a failed relationship. After all, nobody's perfect. Of course, most people who write to internet forums about being victimized by their girlfriends are amateur screen writers, and only people with no worldly experience could ever believe the hyperbolized soap-operas these guys cook up.

And thanks to everyone that has PM'd us to ""keep up the good work"". We appreciate hearing from you. 

As some of you may know we've been tossing around ideas on how to handle the weekend megathreads. We've also been talking about doing something different on the weekends. Like a theme, or shtick, or something. Well we've combined everything into one, big, weekend extravaganza. 

Starting Friday at midnight until Sunday at midnight we are ...

* opening /r/circlebroke to /r/atheism and /r/politics postings. No megathreads. Knock yourselves out. 

* There will be minimal intervention from mods except in cases of gross violation of the sidebar rules. This one is a little tricky, so it should be interesting to see how it goes. If something you submitted gets removed and you get all ""WTF?"", don't get to bent out of shape. We're not really sure what we mean either.

* Feel free to get a little ""jerkier"" in your submission titles, and comments. The needle can lean a little more towards /r/circlejerk, but no where near /r/braveryjerk. DO NOT go /r/braveryjerk. 

* And lastly, and this one is just a suggestion, and not a rule: please explore some smaller, non-default subreddits. Flush out some rampant misogyny and racism. ""OMG DAE SRS-lite?!?!?!""

This is an experiment for THIS weekend only. If it works, then we might consider making it permanent. So relax. Chill out. Have some fun. Uncork the Champagne. Maybe even call your mother, and tell her you love her. But most importantly, [have fun, and have fun doing it](http://youtu.be/VcHoybroIcc).

1345051462.0,80,self.circlebroke,y9qxv,4chan: Reddit's cool older brother,douglasmacarthur,113,33,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/y9qxv/4chan_reddits_cool_older_brother/,"/r/funny has given +2800 and counting, and the second position on my front page, to a post titled [Go 4CHAN!](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/y9fxb/go_4chan/). I think that warrants a /r/circlebroke thread on Reddit's bizarre affinity for 4chan.

Part of the reason this is getting so much recognition is that there was an earlier thread about this, but that just makes Reddit's admiration for 4chan stronger, doesn't it? And there are various other 4chan-admiring posts and comments on Reddit all the time. But why talk about another website so much when you have your own, competing site with a similar purpose?

It seems to be a meme on Reddit that 4chan is this cool, subversive place and Redditor's are cool just for knowing about it. I suppose that admiration isn't *entirely* unearned given that Reddit staples like Good Guy Greg and many other online jokes and images macros came from 4chan. But 4chan is also known as a breeding ground for racists and pedophiles - or is that just another example of Reddit adopting 4chan's creative work? Reddit seems to chronically lack originality, both for its good or for its horrible, horrible parts.

To be less of a smart ass, I think it's idiotic to...

- treat an incredibly, incredibly well-known web forum as some kind of special secret Redditors are cool for knowing about

- treat pretty much any kind of web forum as some kind of special secret anyone is cool for knowing about

- treat a website full of so much racism, CP, etc. as admirable 

- copy images from that site, and talk about how you love that site, on another instead of just going there; [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRKP3VbI41M&amp;t=19s) has a line that puts it in the best way I've seen

In summary, Reddit is slovenly to 4chan and that's weird on many levels.

Unsurprisingly 4chan seems to hate Reddit even though Redditors love it. Reddit is the less edgy, more nerdy, 4chan with a one-way love for it and a desire to be it - in summary, 4chan's little brother.

I'm astounded. 

If I was a member of the US Military I'd be blind with anger towards these smug douchebags. They don't know what they want. They call for the elimination of the Taliban - then spit the dummy out and cry when someone tries to do something about it. 

Redditors are entirely driven by emotion, look at this post:

&gt;What kind of a monster do you have to be to coldly shoot a woman in the back as she sits there passively? These men are not human beings they are heartless animals plain and simple. They have broken their contract with civil society and **if I had any say they would be punished for their crimes in the most horrific way possible in their shit hole of a country.**

Currently sitting at 54 points. Redditors love outrage like this, so they upvote it. When they realise he is basically advocating for the War in Afghanistan - they'd shit their pants. 

It seems like the US Military can't do anything right with Reddit. I haven't seen one comment in that thread so far that actually praises them or acknowledges the work they done. Because guess what? They've fucked **a lot** of the Taliban up. The Taliban are a total shadow of what they used to be - and that is thanks to the War in Afghanistan. What is so fucking evil about being grateful for that or acknowledging that? 

But wait! The War in Afghanistan has killed CIVILIANS! So therefore we can't mention the evil American Army. Forget the fact that compared to other wars civilian deaths have been quite low and forget the fact that the Taliban deliberately put themselves in situations that will lead to innocents dying when soldiers defend themselves.

Why is it lazy?  

1. It's not about any actual opinion on any real issue.

2. Every comment involved in it is exactly the same.  At least Redditors sometimes have *different reasons* from one another for hating cops or wanting to Legalize It.

3. It contributes literally nothing to any discourse.  At least ""fuck those Rethuglicans"" or whatever is another data point in the realm of public opinion, however shabby, but the jerk I'm examining today *can't even do that*.

What does it look like?  I give you **[Exhibit A](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1et2v6/man_of_steel_fate_of_your_planet_official_trailer/ca3hnhq)**.

This jerk always plays out in the same manner.  A post mentions the website TVTropes, usually with some mock-severe warning about it.  Subsequent commenters fall all over themselves to note how they've been sucked into the yawning abyss that this *website about television* constitutes.

Some sample replies follow.  I've chosen one thread's worth because that's where I was when I had finally had enough, but you'll find the same exact collection of comments - verbatim, basically - in any thread in which this comes up.

The whole thread is really awful, with arm-chair combat smuggery and the usual hate towards Muslims. But I wanted to point out that reddit can't be serious for even one fucking thread. This is war, not a video game and not a joke. And I know that sometimes humor is a way for people to cope, but I'm pretty positive most of these upper-middle class neckbeards haven't experienced anything like war outside of Call of Duty.

[Brave redditors tell their story](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/18nn61/beggars_in_romania_and_probably_other_countries/c8gdeuz)

So while it is true that Roma gangs use mothers and their children; send them begging on the streets so that passerbys will feel sorry for the children, they do not actually murder them to be more quiet. That makes only sense in horror movies. But no-one picks up on that, everyone is too busy mentioning that yes, roma mothers with kids do beg in the streets and they are part of a gang. (why on earth should the kids be quiet to get more sympathy?)We know that, it is true and it happens in Romania, Bulgaria, Italy,France, USA. But in what fucking country do people think the easiest thing to do is murder some kids to make more money while begging?

I have commented a lot in that thread. Sorry

The point i wanted to make is that everyone rushes in to tell the same story instead of upvoting and everyone seems to glance over the fact that this is about killing kids with cocaine or alcohol. This is just a horror story, a shitty one even but everyone feels they should mention how much roma suck.
And a few people of course jump on the bandwagon and start talking about mothers holding dead children and the moment they are called out they start downvoting.
The point is, whether you hate the roma or not is that the story says one things and most people in that thread jumped in to tell ANOTHER thing.

Now what do you do with dead children after they start smelling? Do you eat them? I can't wait for the next brave post to tell me.

But what I'd like to bring up is the relationship between reddit's love of pseudoscience and love of drugs. Now, before I get going, there is a lot of good science that shows health benefits from various illegal drugs and a lot of bad research that shows the opposite. I'm not going to say drugs are bad. What I am going to say is humans use reason only to defend their pre-established beliefs, and if you *prima facie* believe drugs are good then you'll take any quality of evidence for that belief to be good evidence.

However, predictably, the comments talk little about the content of the article and jump off into tangents about the goodness of drugs.  
  
&gt;This will probably get buried, but shrooms helped me with my addiction(s).


&gt;It's a complicated story with lots of details, but I remember that I solely gave credit of my recovery to my use of shrooms.

This is an interesting anecdote, no doubt, but anecdotes make poor evidence for something like this. No matter though, if /r/science were really about valuing science it would be a completely different community. /r/science is about reinforcing preconceived notions, just as all subreddits are (DAE think /r/circlebroke  is the only subreddit that doesn't suck?).

BAM! Now typically any redditor praising alternative medicine (which ""CAM modalities"" is a euphemism for) would be shot down and made a fool but when support is being offered to a more important point (the goodness of drugs), who needs science and reason? Any type of coherent system of beliefs is tertiary to the hivemind in its everlasting quest to become the ultimate basement-dwelling neckbeard. Some commenters in that chain call out this comment and ""CAM modalities"" as bullshit, but it currently sits as the number 3 comment (+59).

In defense of one's idea of what it is to be a ""drug of abuse"" this brave soldier logics his opponents into submission. The DEA's classification of LSD as a schedule 1 drug is arbitrary and doesn't even fit their own damned definition! If any DEA agent ever had taken a basic logic or creative thinking course, they would submit to this LOGIC and REASON. Of course arguing on the internet is an exercise in futility, and the premises of an argument like this are as unsound as they are brave. The DEA's actual definitions for ""drug of abuse"" and ""potential for abuse"" are plainly outlined (they even admit their definitions are debated, as if their policies are based on more than just bullshit) [(DEA, 2011, pp. 8-9)](http://www.justice.gov/dea/docs/drugs_of_abuse_2011.pdf) and allows LSD and other hallucinogens to be reasonably classified as schedule 1. But no matter the facts, there are internets to be won.   
  
There are more golden nuggets in there if you wish to pick through the thread, but I think over all it's an exemplar of why circlejerks can be negative for ""intellectual communities"". If you can say that with a straight face about any part of reddit, some parts are more like perceived intellectual communities (perceived by themselves of course). When everyone believes the same conclusion, no one bothers to evaluate the premises that got them all to the same place.

During my usual browsing of reddit, I've noticed another joke that seems to be on the rise. I am speaking of course of the phrase:

""Not since the accident...""

Oh goodness, do I hate it when I see those words on a page. It makes me want to revert to flipping tables. I decided to do a quick search on /r/all, and see what I could come up with. Sure enough, I got plenty o' overused jokes. On the first page only, I found 4 threads out of 25 posts with the words neatly nestled in the comments. This had some other subs sprinkled in that discourages jokes, or users don't joke around a lot (in my experience anyway).

Our first post is in /r/pics. 

&gt;[Not since the accident. *Sorry, I will see myself out*  *+79*](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/14cfv5/a_little_story_about_how_a_redditor_helped_me_out/c7bv485)

In the context of this post, OP had posted about sending love to another user (jlesamiz) or something. Someone sends J some Reddit Gold, OP thanks them, and someone else asks OP if (assumingly) they still talk to jlesamiz. Then our perpetrator responds with a bit of gold of his own. Thanks for chiming in there buddy. 


Next we go to /r/adviceanimals, the life essence sub of circlejerking.

&gt;[Not since the accident *+13*]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/14cjcs/10_guy_snoop/c7bxxn3)

In this thread we have some traditional jerking over usernames, then we are blessed with this comment almost out of nowhere. Please, laugh at my joke and give me karma before it is overused.

Third we go to /r/funny. Another default, and thats to be expected. This comment is actually in the children of the top comment.

You know what... I'm only going to post the link because I'm sure you can guess by now what he/she is going to say.

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/14cbe7/this_is_wong/c7builj *+81*

The thread starts out as a pun thread, then a gif about pun threads is posted, a couple more jokes (?), then this le gem. Directly following this gem is jerking *about* the phrase.

On a side note, Someone also posted ""So it has come to this."" a bit further down. I noticed this in thread 2 as well. But thats not the point of this post. Continuing on to...

The final post in everyone's favorite sub: f7u12!

http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/14c8wm/the_worst_kind_of_texts/c7bwqlt *+29*

This thread is also a top comment at the time of this writing. Apparently, also at the time of writing, it is OP's cakeday. So the [first comment is a gif about cakedays, wherein a girl is blowing out candles on a cake, and has her face smashed into it](http://i.imgur.com/mciRA.gif). The girl appears to be at least unconscious, and the next comment points out a candle may have gone through her eye. Gross.

The next comment references The Dark Knight, where (spoiler)Joker slams a goons head onto a pencil pike(/spoiler). Following that is our gem. Execution could not have been better for this one. Thankfully, my faith in humanity has been restored thanks to a reply to the comment in question, stating that it does not work and to stop it.

In conclusion, this phrase pisses me off. I needed to vent, and I've been a longtime lurker of this sub. I apologize if this isn't up to par with other CB posts, I'm not a very good writer, and I'm bad at expanding the discussion of my argument.

The subreddit /r/confession is a place where people can share their secrets without fear of judgment. This particular confession was from a person who feels that his work in customer service has made him racially prejudice. Fine. I can appreciate when a person acknowledges when they've done wrong, and if he's posting in a place that is supposed to be judgment-free, I'm not going to disparage his post.

The problem, then, is that it seems like the point of the post is to validate his racism and provide him with a soapbox to espouse his beliefs. About three sentences of the post are an actual confession. The remaining paragraphs go into detail about how Chinese people are inconsiderate and Indian people smell.

Well, so what? We see racism on Reddit every day. There's nothing terribly unique about this post. The problem is in the response. In many [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/x2o41/husbands_of_redditim_the_man_fucking_your_wife/) that push the boundaries, the response is an undignified
&gt;[Fuck you, man.](http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/x2o41/husbands_of_redditim_the_man_fucking_your_wife/c5iohff)

People don't generally tolerate behavior like that, subreddit rules be damned.

Here, though, the OP's mention of racial prejudice triggers a torrential outpouring of racism. Never mind being a judgment-free zone; the comments section is filled with people voicing their agreement:
&gt;Oh thank you. I work retail and can't agree more that asians/ indians are the worst.

and

&gt;There's nothing wrong with being **racist**. Because for the most part you're hugely **right**.

and

&gt;I worked as a server on and off during college and graduate school and I can't remember a single positive experience I had with a black family.

and

&gt;One of the stores I was at was the first grocery store right outside the border of Detroit. You can imagine how my perspective on African-Americans is like sometimes. While I have had a few that made me rethink my bias the vast majority are rude, try to steal, and will lie right to your face.

and many more. The worst are the generalizers. It's one thing to be outwardly and admittedly racist, but it's another thing entirely to take one example of people behaving poorly, chalk it up to the race of the people involved, and then to act as though they have the authority to speak to the behaviors of an entire group of people.

As always when Reddit breaks into a racist frenzy, you'll always have the accompanying ""it's not that I'm racist, I just don't agree with black *culture*"" comments. Much like the ""I don't hate women, I hate feminism"" crowd or the ""I don't hate Jews, I hate Israel"" crowd, the people who make comments like these seem to feel that by making the distinction, they have carte blanche to make derogatory comments under the guise of objectivity and reason.

As far as I can tell, the only moderating voice in the comments section,

&gt;...You're a bigoted jackass because you're justifying your hateful prejudices.

I enjoy browsing /r/bestof. The linked comments are, indeed, some of the best reddit has to offer. However, once a comment has been submitted to bestof, good luck finding a decent thread of discussion following. It's far easier to grab some easy karma by posting some reference to [insert TV show reddit enjoys] or a comparison to Hitler than to contribute. That probably makes this pretty low-hanging fruit, but eh.

[This link hit my frontpage this morning while I was on break at work,](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1hdq45/lets_honor_neil_armstrong_heres_a_petition_to/catkf6c) and I decided to take a look. Time to see how many classic jerks reddit can fit in here!

One brave redditor, seeing his chance, grabs some easy karma with a Firefly quote:
&gt;[""It's my estimation that every man ever got a statue made of him was one kind of a sumbitch or another"" - Captain Malcolm Reynolds](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1hdq45/lets_honor_neil_armstrong_heres_a_petition_to/catq609)

That bravery, dear Redditor, will net you a cool 75 karma (86/11 at time of post). 

In reply to the comment that Columbus is sometimes called ""[a product of his time""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1hdq45/lets_honor_neil_armstrong_heres_a_petition_to/catku2x), another jerker proves [Godwin's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law) is entirely correct.

&gt;[Hitler was a product of his time too.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1hdq45/lets_honor_neil_armstrong_heres_a_petition_to/catp8pt)

Well done, good and faithful redditor! While others offer something to advance this line of discussion, you breeze in with the Hitler reference and profit to the tune of 24 points! (38/12 at time of post) Because it's all about that positive karma!

In search of more pop culture-referential jerks? This guy's got you covered, with a quick Game of Thrones joke:

&gt;[It's not that unusual, we celebrate King Joffrey Day. Who's gonna turn down a 3-day weekend?](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1hdq45/lets_honor_neil_armstrong_heres_a_petition_to/catodds)

*""Hey dude, I watch that show! Have my upvote, good sir/madam.""* And so our redditor makes his exit, his hand cramping and sticky, his pockets jingling with the sound of +63 karma. (76/13 at time of post)

Elsewhere, did you think the thread would end without a disparaging attack on the US school system? Never fear, circlebroker, you shall not counterjerk in vain! Not willing to leave without their karma, some incredibly brave souls make sure to indicate their hate for American schools.

&gt;[As a young kid, maybe 10 or so, I asked my teacher what the difference between Columbus and Hitler were. She was mad and asked what I meant. I said, ""They both took land that wasn't theirs, while killing locals."" I got detention for that.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1hdq45/lets_honor_neil_armstrong_heres_a_petition_to/cato6jr)
&gt;&gt;[Wow. US schools are unbelievably awful.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1hdq45/lets_honor_neil_armstrong_heres_a_petition_to/catovaq)

&gt;[BRB, mailing this to every teacher ever. In 6th grade we actually had to do a play on how great Columbus was, and I objected, and got six months of detention. Six freaking months.

A voice of reason tries to defend US schools, and is just *pwned* by this young brave:

&gt;[...][Plus the teacher being so worthless makes it 99% a US teacher.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1hdq45/lets_honor_neil_armstrong_heres_a_petition_to/catsyzy)

*4true20me*

And thus the anti-school jerk continues:

&gt;[Thank you. It never occurred to me to revisit the propaganda fed to me in school when I was a kid. You have opened my eyes.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1hdq45/lets_honor_neil_armstrong_heres_a_petition_to/cato6qe)

I have a feeling that this *might* be sarcasm, but those 31 upvotes, I'm fairly sure, are sincere and dripping with sticky reddit eupohria. **DAE schools are propaganda machines?**

But jerking against the schools of the United States is not enough! We must jerk **bigger**, redditors! And here it is:

&gt;[Ahhh. So this is why our country reveres Christopher Columbus. It's like he wrote the ""How to"" book on our international relations.
](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1hdq45/lets_honor_neil_armstrong_heres_a_petition_to/catrw48)

Ah, the best lube of all, Amerikka^TM brand moisturizing lotion! Now with 35 percent more genocide! Jerk away, reddit, jerk away! Here's some more, in case you were worried we'd run out!

&gt;[Sounds like a true capitalist. no wonder we sing songs of praise about Columbus in America.](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/space/comments/1hdq45/lets_honor_neil_armstrong_heres_a_petition_to/catza8f)

How did you know I just got done singing *""I Fucking Love Christopher Columbus (And Genocide Isn't That Bad)""?* I mean, it's just such a catchy tune!

There's more, but nothing else is really catching my eye now. Besides, I'm done braving reddit's semen-encrusted depths for now.

Now, I was quite surprised by the  number of upvotes it received (its currently sitting at +743), but don't worry, the comment section is *just* as circlejerky as you'd expect. Before I begin, I know both /r/atheism and anything to do with the BBT is low hanging fruit, but this post was so predictable, I just couldn't resist. Let's begin.

The top comment, currently at [+105]:

&gt; Uh, no. Reason to like the actor a bit more, maybe. The show still sucks.

Okay, kind of predictable, but it wouldn't be too bad if there weren't *fifty other variations of the exact same comment in this thread*. Such as:

&gt;I'm so conflicted! I want to give you an upvote because that's the ideal way to handle a rumour about your sexuality but I want to downvote because Big Bang theory sucks monster dicks

&gt;Another reason not to love the Big Bang Theory: It isn't funny.


The second top comment is questioning why this is even in /r/atheism to begin with, but don't worry, the third comment brings up the anti-BBT jerk again:

&gt; This show fucking blows no matter what... If laugh track was taken away no one would know a single joke was said...

and then

&gt; And then the crowd laughed. 15 seconds after that the crowd laughed again. Repeat every 15 seconds for the next 30 minutes minus the commercials and there you have the big bang theory.

This is one of the more prevalent reasons why Reddit hates this show: ""because if you take the laugh track out, it's awkward and unfunny"", and they often cite a youtube video where the laugh track is removed as proof. Ignoring the fact that three seconds of dead air after every joke would make anything unfunny, but I digress.  

Of course there's the ""I hate it because it makes fun of smart people like me"" jerk:

&gt; Because it feels like it's a group of people acting how dumb people think smart people act... rather than how smart people actually act.....

and then there's my personal favorite:

&gt; It's a nerd thing, smart people do not like being portrayed so negatively. It's just as offensive to nerds as blackface was to blacks.

And finally we have the inevitable mentions of ""it's not as good as Community"" , when OP (downvoted to [-8]) asks what comedies Reditors do enjoy, since they hate the BBT so much:

&gt; Community [+14]


Basically, there's nothing wrong with disliking the BBT, but do Redditors *have* to express their vitriolic hatred towards it en masse anytime anyone dares to mention it? We get it, it's stupid and everyone who watches it is stupid, and it has a laugh track, and is literally as bad as the discrimination racial minorities face, and it's not the high brow humor of Community. Now stop shouting at us.

""Grading is part of the job, teachers know what they signed up for.""
""Inc butthurt teachers that act like they have it SOO hard and trying to justify shitty behavior.""

**College Liberal**  
This one really confuses me, I thought most redditors self-identified as liberal, so what are they complaining about?

The general sentiment of the thread is that taking the works of another person without attributing or pay is wrong. Really wrong. But it's totally worse than piracy, as another redditor tells us:

&gt;I think, with pirating, everyone's willing to say, ""Hey, this person/these people made this, we just don't want to/can't/already paid for it, but for whatever reason we downloaded it for free. Credit is given where credit is due, just not money.
With this, it's, no money is given, no credit is given, nothin'. Machinima basically slapped it up on their page and said, ""Hey, look at this funny little picture! Like our page, come visit us! Who made it? Well... Someone did, right? Just enjoy it, don't worry!""
So that's why it seems that nobody is okay with it.

It always blows my mind when someone complains about some big company stealing something they posted to imgur and never planned to monetize, and the community that constantly jerks about piracy backs them up.

Firstly, I have no idea why it didn't link to politifact.com, instead of theatlanticwire.com, but this isn't even what leaves me in awe at /r/Politics' stupidity. 

As I write this, the thread I'm talking about sits at the #4 spot on the front page of /r/Politics, with 1450 upvotes. And, as you would expect, most of the comments are no-less childish than the OP:


* [Well, if you consider the US has a population of about 315 million, and 60 million voted for Romney, that's about 19%, and figure probably 25% of them didn't believe Romney and just thought it was political gamesmanship, that leaves maybe 45 million people who are morons.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/14q5rc/mitt_romneys_campaign_ad_claiming_president_obama/c7fmc7l)

Exaggerated paraphrase: Most of the people that voted for Romney are morons. I have my own made-up statistics and demographics to prove it.

 
* [I would wager that half of those are not morons, but just self-important uninformed people who have their heels dug in on ideology. The other half of those are probably just too damn tired to care.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/14q5rc/mitt_romneys_campaign_ad_claiming_president_obama/c7fmpad)

Exaggerated paraphrase: Half of the people that voted for Romney are ideologues, and the other half don't even care. I totally don't sound like an ideologue myself.


* [At least Romney won something!](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/14q5rc/mitt_romneys_campaign_ad_claiming_president_obama/c7fendg)

Exaggerated paraphrase: Romney was such a liar, so this is the only victory he deserves. I didn't have anything important to contribute to this already shitty discussion, but I felt it was necessary to add my own shit.
 
I could barely believe how biased /r/Politics' bashing of Romney was during the election, but I am incredulous at the fact that they are bashing him *after* he lost. That whole thread is entirely redundant and childish. It's almost as if it is not enough that he lost; some people just want to dehumanize him, despite the fact that he probably has had absolutely no effect on their own lives. 

Edit: I just noticed that directly below the post I'm talking about, there is *another* thread about the exact same thing, complete with 1999 upvotes. /r/Politics never ceases to bewilder me. 

Edit 2: A comment from the other thread:

* [This is a lesson for all of you people saying, ""It doesn't matter, the election is over"". Reflection and critical analysis of past events is one of the most important ways that you can grow as a human being. If you go through life thinking each event ""just happened"" without acknowledging the catalysts, critical decision points, missteps, and successes then you will never be the best person you can be. This is why the best athletes in the world review footage of their opponents and themselves - you learn from your mistakes and you learn from the mistakes of others. It is especially important to reflect on the events after time has passed to discount the effects of fatigue, saturation, and emotional involvement.

Exaggerated paraphrase: Romney was such a terrible person, we must analyze this election to make sure that we never elect someone as evil as Romney, because Romney would have become a lying tyrant. 

This comment has 398 upvotes.

And the top comment from the other thread, with 458 upvotes: 

* [The entire Romney Campaign should have been the Lie of the Year. Everyday for the last year and a half was some new pile of horse shit from his campaign -- a stupefying train wreck made only sadder by the amount of people who supported his candidacy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/14q28q/lie_of_the_year_the_romney_campaigns_ad_on_jeeps/c7fd58e)

Exaggerated paraphrase: Romney is the worst person alive because he allegedly said a lot of untruthful things during his campaign. He told nothing but lies everyday. I lost a lot of faith in humanity because people voted for him, and not because there are lots of people suffering around the world. Voting for someone like Romney is a crime against humanity.

It appears that bashing Romney is a surefire way to get Karma on /r/Politics, even after the elections are over. I wonder how long it will be before the anti-Romney circlejerking subsides.

Yes, just like cursing, children should be exposed to nudity as early in life as possible. Amerikkka has one of the highest friendzone-per-capita (FZPC) rates in the entire world, and early exposure to nudity would drastically reduce this rate. I wrote my dissertation on it. I have a PhD.

1348002942.0,78,self.circlebroke,103lxe,r/AdviceAnimals becomes the place to rant about the evil Mods,eighthgear,90,12,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/103lxe/radviceanimals_becomes_the_place_to_rant_about/,"So apparently some billionaire - Bruce McMahan - had an incesty relationship with his daughter. This went up on Wikipedia, and was taken down, [for reasons which are explained by a Wikipedia editor](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/102qtm/til_that_wikipedia_deleted_a_page_about_a/c69xdb6).

&gt; Additionally, the topic itself is simply not notable. Unfortunately, incest is a widespread practice committed by a unknown but sizeable number of people around the world every day. The fact that this person is rich (and not even famous for anything other than being featured in a series of articles on Village Voice about how famous he should be) does not somehow make his crime more heinous. Wikipedia simply cannot write an article about every person who molests his daughter or tries to marry their daughter (""tries"" being the keyword, as they were not legally married, and the article even admits this by using ""married"" in quotes).

&gt; The article's author, who is apparently completely incapable to using calm and reasoned language, devolves into Alex Jones-level conspiracymongering by claiming everyone on Wikipedia is ""scared"" of this guy and his money. Wikipedia has published everything from child porn to images of gore to nudity of famous celebrities and politicians--but we're scared of this guy?

&gt; On a few rare occasions, Wikipedia has taken down or removed content from serious legal threats. But when that happens, Wikipedia's board of directors places a personal message on the (former) article's namespace with an image of a black padlock, explaining the nature of the dispute, similar to Google's chilling effects archive. As you can see, no such thing happened here, and contrary to the article's conspiracy raving, there is no record this man ever actually sued Wikipedia.


Yeah, the situation seems kinda weird, and yeah, McMahan seems like a bit of a creep. However, Wikipedia had a justifiable reason to remove it. If every bit of information about the personal lives of famous people that comes solely from biased media sources was Wikipedia-worthy, Wikipedia would be full of shit.

Anyways, the TIL post claimed that Bruce McMahan forced Wikipedia do remove the information via legal threats. There is no evidence of that whatsoever. Hence, the post was removed from TIL. This makes sense: if I made a post saying ""TIL the Eiffel Tower is actually made of galvanized baguettes"", it would be removed for being false information. The article that the TIL post linked to was clearly biased and no better than some tabloid drivel.

So somebody (who is rather ""famous"" on Reddit) made [a very clever image macro](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3qyu89/) and posted it on [r/AdviceAnimals](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals) (with a not too surprising lack of both advice and an animal). Instant karma storm. Lets see what ensues:

&gt; [Bruce McMahan has spent a lot of money censoring websites like Wikipedia. It seems Reddit can be silenced quite easily too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1037vd/scumbag_reddit_and_the_removal_of_the_til_post/c6a0ac6)

Yeah, I bet Bruce rang up Reddit just today and threatened them. Oh wait, that probably didn't happen, and until you can find proof, you are just pulling stuff out of your ass.

&gt; [Since when did moderators become thought police?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1037vd/scumbag_reddit_and_the_removal_of_the_til_post/c6a1qdh)

Ugh. Really - thought police? Have you even read 1984? Removing a TIL because the information in the link is faulty is not akin to ""thought police"".

To be fair, the top reply to this drivel points out that freedom of speech doesn't apply on private sites like Reddit. Nevertheless, tons of commenters fall into the same group as this guy: the mods are evil Gestapo thugs hurting my free speeches.

Yup, no other scenario. I'm fine if you believe that, but there is little proof. TIL is for stuff with actual proof. Also, I'm pretty sure that American media goes after the personal lives of people who are both more rich and more powerful than McMahan all the time. McMahan just isn't that famous.

Yeah, it is sooo strange that an members institution made to keep order (the mods) would act sort of like they were in a position of governance. Oh wait, it isn't - because they are in a position of governance. If Reddit had half the order of a western nation, it would be much better.

Aaand to end it all,

From the [OFFICIAL SNOO HAT](http://store.xkcd.com/reddit/) to even permanant [tatoos](http://i.imgur.com/L9Cmm.jpg) (NSFW). Redditors want to let others know of their secret club and community in hopes of finding another misguided *quirky* lost soul in the midst of the hustle and bustle of the real world.

There are T-shirts, bumper stickers and yes, even underwear to show your significant other and your genitals, the love you have for Reddit.com. 

According to Reddipedia.com, Snoo was the original project name for Reddit and now the little girl is plastered everywhere. (Yes it was decided that it was female somewhere along the way).

From freeway bumper sticker, to the front page imgur post of the bumper sticker entitled, ""A wild Redditor appears. Which one of you magnificent bastards is this""? Only to potentially doxx or have a giant orgy of nowkiss.jpg when the person responds. The ultimate cum drizzling stroke fest continues as the Reddit world of several million has 2 of them outgoing enough to show their ""Reddit pride"" and get a top comment consisting of, ""Yep, that's me"".

As you can see, the average circlebroker is has been here between 6 and 24 months, is between 18 and 29, a white male, is single, is more to the center of the political scale, has been to college, is unemployed or in school still, an atheist or agnostic.

Some things I was surprised about:

Christianity was the third most popular response for religion, which, while it isn't surprising since the majority of Americans identify as Christians, I didn't expect.

More people to the center of the political scale than to the left. Also, a fair number or center-rights.

We have a lot of Swedes and Irish people here!

12 PhDs? All in Atheism I suppose?

Also, I did a quick count on all the responses for ""occupation"" and most people here work in IT related fields.

I like gaming. I like it enough to, you know, sit down when I have some free time, set Civilization on a low difficulty, and destroy a machine that is supposed to be smarter than me.  (Give me liberty or give me death, Comrade Genghis Kahn!) Then I go to bed, wake up in the morning, and go about my day.  What I'm trying to say is that I don't feel compelled to somehow spend day after day slaving through a game on the highest difficulty because it's ""the best game ever"".

However, I don't hold it against people who do. If video games are your thing, then great. If you, through some process of deep introspection, have decided that you are ""somehow different"" and are unable to engage with society in a more extroverted way, then I don't look down on you because you've clearly found something that has made you happy. 
However.

I hate /r/gaming. It's made me actively despise interacting with gamers. I hate them all. I hate Zelda. I hate motherfucking Mario and Luigi.  I hate Assasin's Creed fans even though I genuinely enjoyed the game. I hate Portal and its shit sequel, and I think that it's ultimately destructive to present it as somehow more than it is. ([I'm a shit teacher and I am unendingly concerned with how ""happy"" my students are.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/vsxoq/i_think_im_officially_the_coolest_teacher_thanks/)) The cake wasn't a lie, it's a plot device.  I love the game of Civilization, but at the same time, fuck Civilization.  If you want one more turn, than take another fucking turn.

I imagine, you know what will follow, right? Yeah, you do. The whole fucking thread -- until [18h ago someone](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1in577/yahoo_bans_searches_on_tumblr_regarding/cb6a4xt) actually finds and quotes the official Tumblr staff's statement which explains the reason for the ""ban"" on the most holiest thing: porn. 

But by then redditors have already exhausted themselves by circlejerking. Nothing substantive follows after that comment. No one who posted their overreacted circlejerkatory comments reflected on their own silliness, no one retracted their comments, no one apologized, except OP, kind of. 

Though, some redditors still manage to get some roundwank about how Apple is a ""retarded"" company for forbidding pornography on their  AppStore.  

Here have the thoughtless bullshit nicely sorted into categories: 



* **CENSORSHIP**

&gt;Wow. Fuck Yahoo.
You know what's interesting about this? Self flagging as adult puts a no-crawl robots.txt on your blog, censoring it from both internal and external search. If tumblr got upset at yahoo, and everyone flagged themselves as adult, the content of tumblr would disappear from the searchable internet entirely. A deindexed blog is of no use to advertisers.
That would make quite the protest. (427|79)

*Quite the rebel.*

&gt;&gt;That would be amazing. I really wish Yahoo would give it a rest, it's not their job to be the internet puritan police. They did this with Flickr when they purchased it too but they're not blocking it quite as well there luckily. The least they could do is leave the robots.txt alone and offer a checkbox to disable safe search on tumblr I think that would be an ok compromise.
They also bought Astrid (arguably the most popular task list organizer on Android) the other day, and immediately said they're killing the product off, what are they even trying to accomplish (120|11)

---

&gt;Yahoo: creating a better Internet for you whether you want it or not. (60|7)
&gt;&gt;Yahoo: Creating a better internet while you use Google instead.
FIFY(82|12)
&gt;&gt;&gt;Yahoo: Internet Search Provider for the Christian Right. (45|14)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;yahoo search home depot...results: You used the word Home, which is part of Homosexual. Your IP address is xxx.xxx.xx.xxx and now has been flagged and banned for 24hours.  (20|4)

----

&gt;so... Blatant Censorship. (15|7)




* **YAHOO SUCKS**

&gt;Oh coming from yahoo this doesn't surprise me at all, they have no idea how to be relevant other than buying other things that are and hoping they can then be the cool kids. (14|0)

---

&gt;Yahoo is the scummiest of the 'Internet' companies.
I still remember when they bought The All-Seeing Eye only to promptly shut it down. I still don't know what the fuck the point of that was, but All-Seeing Eye was the best game server browser I'd ever used and I don't think there is one to this day that is quite as good as it was. (38|5)

---

&gt;First they ruined Flickr, now they're starting in on Tumblr? As someone who actively uses both of these sites to promote my artwork, this is disheartening to say the least. Yahoo has plans to screw up Flickr even further and I'm sure this is only the beginning of what they'll do to Tumblr.
Yeah, yeah, people have been saying ""just use another site,"" but what are the alternatives? For example, what other site has all the features that Flickr has/had (Yahoo removed many of the sites best features this year with their terrible redesign) and also has a similar community and anywhere near as many users and viewers? And if they run Tumblr into the ground, what other site is out there to take its place? I'm fine with switching to other sites to share my work instead, but my concern is that Yahoo will kill them off and there won't be any real alternatives, or at least none that have the same features and reach the same audience that Flickr and Tumblr did.
Whether you use Tumblr or not, it's a unique site with an enormous userbase and the fact that they're already starting to censor it and alienate pretty much all of their users is bullshit. (14|2)

---

&gt;In other news: People still using Yahoo (18|7)

In other news: Yahoo is still the fourth most visited website. Reddit is still getting some visitors, which is surprising considering that it's absolute cesspool of shit. It's rank has fallen from 122 most visited site to 125 most visited site in just a three months.

* **SMARTER THAN THE CEO OF YAHOO**

&gt;Pay stupid money for a site, destroy it shortly afterwards. WE ARE DA YAHOO Y NO MONEY?? (92|14)
&gt;&gt;Remember Geocities? It's not like this is without precedent... (26|4)

---

&gt;Well, there goes their concern for PR. (139|27)
&gt;&gt;I just listened the the NPR podcast on Yahoo's purchase of TUMBLR, which had a clip of their investor call where they promised not to screw it up.
That really didn't take long. (33|2)

&gt;This CEO runs a company like old people fuck. (55|11)

---

&gt;""Please stop using out services!"" (32|9)

---

&gt;Porn, depression and LGBTQ... do they even know what their own site is about? (33|9)

---

&gt;Jesus fucking christ, my dead grandmother could run Yahoo better than it's currently being run. How many times and how many different products can they possibly manage to fuck up? How is Yahoo even still in business? (35|8)

* **GODDAMN CONSERVATIVES**

&gt;I completely missed the story where Rick Perry bought out Yahoo. (53|7)
&gt;&gt;Didn't Mitt Romney say as president he'd get rid of all internet pornography? LOL (19|7)


* **GODDAMN SJWs, PLEASE CENSOR THEM**

&gt;Get rid of all the social justice blogs next. (63|27)
&gt;&gt;I can't wait for the SJWs to lose their minds over this....the drama will be awesome.  (30|13)
&gt;&gt;&gt;So many pointless thoughts gone... like dust in the wind. (23|15)

---

Also, someone's afraid that SRS might doxxx them: 

&gt;Yes agreeing that a free service that a lot of photographers use to store and show their work has 1TB (as opposed to 122 pictures of old) of storage now is totally being a shill you dumbshit.
Edit: I only use flickr for photographs I want to share with people I don't know these days since people on this site have a tendency to dox (SRS) and threaten you if they don't agree with things you say.

What I find most annoying is that most redditors without any questions  in a mindless kneejerk reaction will start shitting on anyone who they feel has wronged them.

Some choice excerpts:

&gt; The most popular posts appear on Reddit’s home page. A recent example is a bizarre picture of the teenage idol Justin Bieber in a ski mask with a bodyguard in a zippered one-piece sweatsuit. 

&gt; Like many digital operations, Reddit, which is based in San Francisco, keeps its staff mean and lean. It has 25 employees, and uses volunteers to police its Web site to make sure rules are obeyed. Among Reddit’s basic rules are a prohibition against vote manipulation, spam, child pornography and revealing other people’s personal information. 

They forgot to add those rules are barely followed.

&gt; Still, anyone who starts a subReddit essentially becomes its dictator, deciding who can moderate and who has access. This has not always turned out so well. 

Then they forgot to mention Karmanaut! :(

&gt; Reddit shut down Jailbait, but it took months for the site to make a rule banning suggestive sexual content featuring minors. And even that was reluctantly. “At Reddit we care deeply about not imposing ours or anyone else’s opinions on how people use the Reddit platform,” the site explained apologetically at the time. 

The admins are always care to not infringe on the rights of pedophiles.

&gt; The problem in the case of the Boston bombings, which inspired the thread “findbostonbombers,” was that no explicit rules were being violated — at first. The instructions were simply: “Any and all theories welcome.” 

What could go wrong!?!?!?!?!?



Anyway, this is a good summary of what is wrong with Reddit today, an awful group of moderators who are too afraid of violating someones ""free speech"" than to get rid of the truly awful stuff.

These people don't understand the issue at all, and simply use it as a way to seem pro-science (the funny part is they have no idea what they're talking about) and anti-America, **at the same time**. Case in point:

http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1203cx/til_fahrenheit_remains_the_official_scale_of_the/

Oh, America and two small countries are the only ones that still use Fahrenheit? What backwards idiots run those countries? The comments are so bad. I got into a bit of a heated discussion with someone who was actually advocating that we should all use *Kelvin* as our only temperature unit. Yes, Kelvin. Since that makes SO MUCH SENSE. And what's his reasoning?

&gt;Those of you arguing in favor of Farenheit:

&gt;You are advocating that ""commoners"" use a different system of measurement than ""scientists"". If nothing else this only further separates the majority from science, alienates them from it, and makes them uncomfortable with it. This is already a huge problem in our society, especially in America where the number of STEM students is falling at an alarming rate. If there is a good reason for ""scientists"" to use a particular scale or unit of measurement then those same reasons should apply to everyone, because EVERYONE should consider themselves a scientist in their every day lives, even if the only experiment they ever do is to determine which brand of paper towel is a better value or whatever.

&gt;In fact, merely by making this change we might help more people understand the physical reality behind heat and understand what it is and what absolute zero is and then they may even gain a better understanding of physics in general as a natural byproduct of this... this may in turn make them more receptive to other scientific principles.

&gt;The mental disconnect between scientists and non-scientists is damaging, and is holding us back, and any little thing we can do to combat that is beneficial in ways that most cannot even imagine.

Ha. He wants to switch Kelvin to bridge the ""mental disconnect"" between ""scientists"" and ""commoners"". How much more fucking pretentious can you get? I mean yeah, I'm all for STEM and stuff, but instituting Kelvin into a world where Fahrenheit and Celsius work so much better is fucking insane. This guy appears to have no idea how society functions, and is merely advocating ""Everyone should think like a scientist"".

&gt;However, what's really funny is people arguing Fahrenheit was ""better"" or more intuitive - the whole scala is based on someone using a very cold day in winter 1708 in Poland as the 0°. Yeah, that makes sense.

Ugh. Yes, Fahrenheit is a little arbitrary compared to Celsius. How does that make it SO MUCH WORSE though? In Fahrenheit, when you're in a generally temperate region of the world, 0 degrees is roughly the coldest you'll get and 100 degrees is roughly the hottest you'll get. It's a good system for weather because it has a common range of positive two-digit numbers. But no, it sucks because it was derived from something arbitrary. Never mind *everything else about the unit*. It *must* suck because it was derived from something arbitrary. 

&gt;While the Fahrenheit height scale sucks for measurement, temperature is the least of our measurement concerns. Metric measurement for mass, volume, and distance would be much better to switch to if we were to focus on switching to SI units.

Alright, it wouldn't be a metric circlejerk without someone mentioning every other measurement without any reasoning for why we should switch. Come to think of it, I've NEVER heard anyone give a legitimate reason for why we should switch. Every time I ask someone, they usually reference that NASA thing where someone did a bad conversion between metric and imperial, and it cost them a lot of money. Alright, yeah, that was one thing, but that's the ONLY time in science that the imperial system has fallen short. Anyone with a job in science whose job depends on making precise measurements is already using metric. I'm pretty sure most of the metric circlejerkers don't even know that. They think that everyone in America is forced to use imperial, and we all laugh in the faces of metric simply because we all think America is better than the rest of the world.

Pretty much the only thing we use imperial for is weights, gas/food amounts, length, and temperature. And anytime anyone is in a laboratory, they're using metric. So what's the big fucking deal? Our lives wouldn't change in the slightest if we switched. There is no need to make a big deal out of this, and it's just a vehicle for Reddit to let out their anti-America and pseudo-pro-science circlejerking out.",,False,,t5_2tnz9,False,,,True,t3_122dvn,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/122dvn/reddit_and_the_metric_system_the_perfect_mix_of/,

Shitty 'UK IS SO GOOD TEH AMERICANS DUNT UNDERSTAND OUR AMAZING SUBTLE HUMOUR BECASE THEY ARE STUPID' comments have been around on the internet since it began, but I'm growing more and more fascinated by the way that Britons online like to act indifferent towards their country and patriotism, and yet will become embarrassingly antagonistic and defensive the *second* they feel like a foreigner isn't treating their country with the utmost respect.

Okay, so a magnificent bastard is a writing trope. It's a character who is devious, charismatic, and always one step ahead. It's the villain who steals the show, like Iago from *Othello* or Khan from *Wrath of Khan*. Maybe people on reddit don't know this, and that's fine. After all, reddit is full of engineering majors who had their love of reading destroyed forever by cold-hearted high school English teachers who  [forced their own interpretations on them](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/gwjot/what_the_author_thinks_versus_what_your_teacher/).

But even if you didn't know that, which you shouldn't really be expected to, why would you go around calling someone you like a bastard? I can understand [Richard Dawkins](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/re763/happy_birthday_richard_dawkins_you_magnificent/) or [Christopher Hitchens](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/gp1oq/happy_birthday_you_magnificent_bastard/), because they have kind of dastardly public personas. 

But why is [a guy known for a role in a famous sci-fi show and for teaching children how to read](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/psdgo/happy_birthday_you_magnificent_bastard/) a bastard?

Why is [every actor/comedian/musician](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=magnificent+bastard) who has ever had a birthday/died a magnificent bastard?

Even if you just assume that ""magnificent bastard"" is somehow a homonym for ""wonderful human being,"" why can't you come up with a creative submission title? Why can't you make a self post that says ""Today is Dave Chappelle's birthday"" instead of making people click a link that says ""Happy birthday you magnificent bastard!"" which leads to a photograph of Dave Chappelle. I know what Dave Chappelle fucking looks like. And what am I supposed to do with the information that it's his birthday, send him a card? Keep him in my prayers?

The OP makes a decent point about how /r/atheism should be removed from the default list because it could scare off some users and in some cases can seem fairly offensive to outsiders or people who are new to reddit. It also could be unfair to users of faith coming here and suddenly having that blasted in their faces.

This could make some room for discussion on if it is offensive, how offensive it is, should it be removed, should something like /r/religion be added to balance it out, or something along those lines.

A fair amount of people do discuss it and bring up decent points and talk it over. A lot of people also just tell the OP to unsubscribe and stop caring missing the point that he's talking about new and unregistered users who can't do such things, not himself.

For a community that claims that it is so intelligent in many cases they sure seem to miss the point by not reading in a lot of cases.

Let's start by looking at the title: ""I just realized that my daughter is a stuck up bitch. How do i punish her?"" There are two kinds of people who would phrase the question that way: pathetic high school boys (probably the boy in the story) creating elaborate revenge fantasies, or people who are going to beat the shit out of their daughter when they get home.

Then let us examine the story (assuming it is true), but from the daughter's perspective: the boy is the kind described by her father as ""really nice"" and he is friendly enough with administration to be given a microphone in the cafeteria. I'm not saying he is a loser, but he is so intensely asexual that a father would describe him as ""really nice"". If I were a popular high school girl, I probably wouldn't want to go to prom with him either. Now let's suppose that he had been pestering her for a long time and she felt this was the only way to stop him. That's a pretty plausible explanation, at least as plausible as the Hollywood bullshit posted. Again, I'm not calling the boy a loser, but he is probably going to go home and make a rage comic about being friendzoned.

Incidentally, [one comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ssadg/i_just_realized_that_my_daughter_is_a_stuck_up/c4gjliq) calls OP out for calling his daughter a bitch. -40 and counting.

&gt;What a bunch of shitheads

Partytime86 responds to Horse_Guy with a comment that really captures the essence of the thread. 

&gt;Unfortunately this nonsensical barbaric behavior will likely continue because of apologetics swooping in to defend this nonsense. I'm just waiting for SRS to swoop in like good apologetic and start defending this behavior. These barbarians need to be shocked into the modern cultural era where women, homosexuals, and transgender all have equal rights and where we respect free speech and condemn violent outbursts. People like SRS prevent this modernization process by defending anything Islamist do including sexist nonsense such as Sura 4:34 http://quran.com/4/34[1]

A) Love referring to them as barbarians, it has a certain connotation in a lot of circles that really fits this thread. B) Shocking them is the solution, you can see the dialogue was pretty productive while the rioted during the screening. C) Get some SRS in there, if you're commenting and can't work SRS, frankly I think you don't know how to reddit. D) This follows with four additional edits directed at the ""apologist"".

From the comments with four digits of karma, to the humble double digits, Flearis keeps it simple. 

&gt;No respect for free speech, no respect for authority... If you don't like it, go back where you came from... May sound harsh, but honestly if seen this happen way too many times...

Maybe some sort of Islamic Liberia? No..? Well we'll think of something. 


guynamedgriffin
&gt;Why do muslims believe the world owes islam respect? If a country's citizens are free to express themselves,why do some muslims believe it is ok to immigrate to these free countries and try to infringe upon the rights of others in the name of their religion? To do this, and to do so in a violent fashion is simply infuriating to me.

Probably the same reasons the other three quarters of the worlds populations believes they're owed respect? Also the contributions to mathematics, the arts, and well as preserving most of the literature from antiquity. 

b33k3rz
&gt;Why do they even go to Western countries with free speech if they know they will walk away butt-hurt when their stone age religion gets mocked? Why don't they just stay in their native Islamic countries where they will be free to fester in their ignorance?

Economic prosperity, access to improved medical care, better opportunities for their children, escape war/regional conflict, oppressing you. 


Ooo, and I almost missed this one... 

What appears to be an honest question:
&gt;Why did they show up to watch a movie that they don't want to watch? What a bizarre video.

And the answer is....

&gt;To incite violence. The fervor and high from righteous religious violence is a potent drug.
Ask any person at any riot after a big sports team win. Or the blacks who destroyed their own communities during the LA riots.

Excuse the sports reference, but religion, sports and black people in one swing! No one's time is being wasted today. 

If I can figure out how to grab the open screen I have with comments, will do so.

The thread basically complains about how 9Gag is deliberately searching through the content of Reddit, 4chan, and other websites to post onto 9Gag. The thread describes 9Gag as stealing and altering Reddit's OC to market to 9Gag users. 

I find it interesting how Redditors like to act superior to 9Gaggers (is that a thing?) and dislike them for ""stealing"" their content while they praise and love The Pirate Bay for allowing them to download and use Hollywood's property. 

Posts such as [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11mf1l/the_pirate_bay_moves_to_the_cloud_becomes/) praise The Pirate Bay for tackling corporations that charge for the distribution of music and movies. But, in the above post about why Reddit dislikes 9Gag, Redditors seem to be taking on the viewpoint of Hollywood in saying that Reddit's posts are its own property and 9Gag has no right to use them. In one situation Redditors support an underdog in trying to win freedom and break a ""monopoly"" over the music industry, whereas in another they seek to punish those that try to steal their intellectual property. 

I find this contrast interesting and although none of these posts are exactly topical currently, I strongly believe that these viewpoints are held by the masses of Redditors and are still applicable today. 

This is my first post to this sub-reddit, so please forgive me if I have messed up any format or haven't explained myself well enough.

Didn't read? The poster tells /r/atheism about how he taught sunday school at a church, with some nonessential remarks about how the Bible doesn't make sense the closer you look at it. One day, he is heading home from the church, which is next door to two other big churches, and comes across a homeless guy. He tells the homeless man that he doesn't have any change so he will go buy him some food. When he comes back with the food, the homeless man is surprised. 

Sounds good, right? The guy did a genuinely good thing. But how can he turn this story into something that can prove that all Christians are bad? Well, he jumps to the conclusion that since the homeless person was surprised to see him return, nobody from any of the churches has ever helped the man. I mean, there's a homeless guy on the corner of three churches, how can he still be homeless if it wasn't for the evil condescending nature of religion. The poster's conclusion is rash, but the commenters are only supportive of him. Feel free to look through the comments yourself since I am an evil, lazy Christian.
