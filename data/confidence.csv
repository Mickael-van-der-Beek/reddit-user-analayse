1364862530.0,168,self.confidence,1bh8rh,For one night of my life I had confidence. I can honestly say it was the best night of my life.,CorkyPal,184,16,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/1bh8rh/for_one_night_of_my_life_i_had_confidence_i_can/,"I am an 18 year old guy. I'm very shy, awkward, social disaster spending most of my life encased indoors.

This saturday night I wen't to a concert, one of my favourite bands, Said the Whale, was opening for Stars. I brought one of my friends along to go see them. And met up with others later on. I wasn't expecting much other than some good music. I saw this really beautiful girl standing next to me. Normally I don't say anything to anyone. But I started up a conversation with her. I started talking to her about the band, she said she came to see Said the Whale too. Once the band played I started to dance, she joined in. After the Said the whale finished playing, I asked her if she'd like to dance again when the Stars start playing. She said told me she really wanted to and I asked her for her number so we could find each other again.

She put: ""Hot girl from concert ;)"" in my contacts.
Immediately I texted her saying: ""Hey, so now you have my number. From equally hot guy from concert. ;)""

We had a good laugh and said we'd meet up after. At this point I was so pumped I couldn't believe I got a girls phone number. Thats never happened to me before. I was super excited. After hanging out with my friends for a while, Stars came back on to play.

She texted me and told me to hold up my phone so she could find me. We met up and she brought me over to her friends and introduced me. We spent most of the songs dancing. I had the confidence to take her hand and twirl her around a few times she was loving it and so was I. Then a slow song came on and I was really really really wanting to hold her hand. It was practically screaming in my mind. I didn't. So we danced a bit more and then another slow song came on. I thought to myself: ""Fuck it, i'm going to hold her hand."" I slowly inched my hand towards her and put it right behind hers, I bumped it and she instantly grabbed it. And thank God the concert was dark because i would've been beet red.

We spent the rest of the concert dancing and holding hands.
I've never held a girls hand before. Hell, I've never got to dance with a girl or get her phone number. I was ecstatic. After the Stars stopped playing I shook her hand and said my goodbyes. My friends were shocked I was able to even work up the courage to talk to her. Let alone do everything else. I seriously wouldn't shut up about it for the rest of the night I was so happy. And keep thinking about her still today.

I don't know where the hell that burst of confidence came from, but it gave me the best night of my life.

tl;dr - I got to hold a girls hand and i'm blooding fucking happy about it.",,False,self,t5_2rmn5,1364864432.0,,,True,t3_1bh8rh,http://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/1bh8rh/for_one_night_of_my_life_i_had_confidence_i_can/,

1336215822.0,83,self.confidence,t880g,From Low Self Esteem to Absolute Confidence! A guide for any and everyone who wishes to be confident,,99,16,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/t880g/from_low_self_esteem_to_absolute_confidence_a/,"Really glad this sub-reddit is up and running. Hopefully it will continue to grow! These are some of the things I did in order to build up my self esteem till I felt confident.

I've suffered with low self esteem for a long time, but I've been working at it and its improving. It may not be quite where I want it, but its getting there. Here's my advice, take it with a grain of salt and figure out what works best for you.

1) Erase negative self thinking. There are different causes of low self esteem, maybe you failed at something or your parents, friends, peers or teachers put you down at one point or for a very long time. The strange thing about that is that even if those people or events that caused you to doubt yourself are no longer in your life, you have internalised it. It doesn't matter what happened, because now you are your own negative reinforcer! So every time you hear yourself saying something negative, about yourself or anyone. Just stop. Stop the train of thought right there.

2) Promote positive self thinking. What is self confidence, but an unwavering positive regard for yourself and your abilities. Every time you hear yourself saying something negative, stop. Now replace that with a positive thought. A friend of mine used to find herself saying in her thoughts ""I hate myself"". Every time she heard herself say this or that train of thought starting she would say ""pickles"" instead. It was silly, but it helped her to stop uttering the phrase. Eventually she replaced it with ""I don't hate myself."" and then ""I like myself"" and then ""I love myself"".

3) Meditate. This one comes up a lot. [1] [1] [1] /r/meditation can probably help you in this area. Meditation teaches you how to focus and calm your mind. Get your mind to be a clam serene ocean as opposed to a wild storm. It doesn't have to be with candles, incense and groovy music either. There are even atheists who meditate. How can you have an unwavering positive regard for yourself if your mind is constantly distracted by negative things, and the negative things you say about yourself? Learn to focus and achieve.

4) Start a journal of some type. I use an ordinary high school notebook, but you can use absolutely anything, even a blog. Write down what your thoughts, it helps big time. Its like a private therapist you are only privy to. For a long time my journal was filled with negative things I would say about myself. Slowly I started writing positive things, as I saw them. Acknowledging thoughts is important in regarding yourself as a person - you've got to acknowledge that you're a person that should be listened to. Writing things down makes them real. And you can track your progress.

5) Talk to people. Have you ever noticed that confident people make friends easily? Have you ever noticed that they can strike up a conversation with anyone? This is actually surprisingly simple! Talk to as many people as you can, make chit chat - this can be to whomever even store clerks, the person serving you. Its not hard to give compliments or be friendly. At first it may seem awkward, but take a risk. Go out there, develop that confidence.

6) Treat others and yourself with respect. What you see in others is what you see in yourself. People who are really judgemental also put themselves to those unrealistic standards. Start accepting others, and you will start accepting yourself. The two are surprisingly related! Think of a confident (not necessarily arrogant) person in your life, notice how they always see the good in others. Do the same. A very useful book in this regard is ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"", which I'm sure you've heard of. Give it a read, the worst that could happen is that you at least tried, the best thing that could happen is that it worked.

7) Keep moving. You can't always control your mind, but you can control your behaviour. If you act in a certain way, pretty soon your mind will follow suit. Change something in your life, do something that makes you happy, practice something that you're good at. Focus on it.

8) Exercise. If you want self confidence and a strong sense of self, you need a good body image. I don't mean you have to have the perfect body, I mean you should be comfortable in your body. You should be aware of it. You should be aware of the space you inhibit. Exercise increases your understanding of your body. It also releases a high that positively influences your thoughts. Exercising to a goal can really build your self confidence.

Here are some VERY useful links, which I have used:

1) [The Mood Gym](http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome) Conditioning positive self thinking and behaviour.

2) [Self Confidence](http://www.self-confidence.co.uk/) This is a 6 part email course, that I found useful. The site offers some products for sale, I haven't looked at those yet so can't comment. I used the free email course and that was good.

The most important thing to do is to keep trying. I'm 28 and only now do I feel confident, after all those years. The point is that I got there, eventually. In 10 years time will you look back on this day and think, I should've done something or will you look back on it as the day you changed for the better? As I said, take everything I've said with a grain of salt and find what works best for you. Please feel free to add things to this list. Good luck :)

A final word, I noticed on the sidebar there are links to seduction reddits. I have no problem with this, but I think this sub-reddit should be about confidence in everything, not just in relationships. Injecting confidence into your family, your work, your friendships and hobbies can only be a good thing.

This is false. what people usually describe as confidence is actually competence. It is through competence that we feel not insecure about our abilities. Competence is knowing what you're doing and doing it well. Competence isn't confidence. The truth about confidence is one of life's wonders because even a lazy person can succeed in this area.if you want to be more confident you don't have to add anything to your personality or skill level. In fact you already have too much of something.because confidence isn't the presence of anything at all. Confidence is a reduction of your interest in whether others are thinking about you, and if so what they're thinking. Confidence isn't something you feel or possess; it's something others use to describe what they see when they look at you. Trying to feel confident will instead make you anxious. You'll never experience a single moment of confidence in your life. Instead of thinking about confidence, what you need to do is focus on exactly what's happening in the instant.

I used to be very self-conscious. While I am still self-conscious to some degree, I have seen massive improvements and would like to help others see the same. This i primarily geared towards men, but a lot of what I'm saying may be useful to women too.

**Body Language**

* Get fit. Quite possibly the easiest way to gain confidence. If you're skinny, lift and eat like fucking crazy. If you're fat, make a life choice to change your diet (less sugar, no soda), and exercise. Barring a medical condition, there is absolutely nothing stopping you from looking like [this](http://build-muscles.maxupdates.tv/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Flat-Stomach-and-Ripped-Abs-a.jpg). Do you think that guy is confident? Truthfully, you have no idea what he thinks. However, he looks confident, and that's all that matters. A large portion of being confident is appearing confident. 

* Take up space. This can very easily be related to getting fit. Confident people take up space. If you're sitting down, spread your legs and lean back. On a couch? Spread your wings and rest them on the top of the couch.

* Always appear relaxed. Being confident is all about being in control. Tense people are very rarely in control. If you're out drinking, lean up against the bar. Don't hold your drink in front of your chest, leave it hanging at your side. Make deliberate movements. Don't fidget.

**Interactions**

* I listen to my iPod constantly. I used to have the habit of turning it off every time I passed someone, so I could prepare for the possible greeting. At the gym, I would turn it off constantly if I thought someone was nearing me to ask me a question or start a discussion. The problem with this approach is that it puts the impetus on you to prepare for coming interactions. The correct way to deal with these situations is to let people make the move before you react. If they greet you, nod, say 'hi', and move on. Don't put too much thought into passing greetings. If you're listening to music, ignore them completely until they've actually addressed you. Then, take out your earphones, ask them to repeat themselves, and answer their questions. Don't rush any interaction, and don't be afraid to ask people to repeat themselves. I realize these examples are specific but I believe they are common.

* Understand that everyone has a mind similar to yours. People may say things they regret. The incredible-looking, confident-seeming girl you just talked to may be wishing she had handled the interaction differently. She may be obsessing over the smallest detail: the slight pause in your reply, the lack of a smile in your face, the short, stilted, uninterested response you provided. The truth is that everyone thinks, and no one is so self-confident that they don't question their own actions on occasion. This is an important realization. Even the most beautiful girl may feel rejected by the ugliest man. Knowing how your own responses affect others is a useful and learnable skill. My only request is that, upon learning this skill, you do not use it to abuse others. Most people depend heavily on human interaction, and are very manipulable as a result.

* Don't complain. Nearly everyone will have at least one consistent problem in their life. Maybe your knees are fucked up. Maybe you have migraines. Maybe your family is shitty. Whatever. As important as these issues are, they will never mean to others what they mean to you. Complaining about them will not have the effect you desire, and will cause your peers to cast you in a negative light.

**Personal**

* Don't get angry. Remain relaxed and in charge in all situations. If you encounter a problem, remedy it calmly. A lot of people get very angry over small things. Let me give you an example. A friend of mine who is an angry drive, upon missing a turn, flips his shit, complains, yells at his GPS, swears at other drives, and generally appears childish. My brother, upon missing a turn, doesn't say a word, gets in the next turning lane, and resolves the problem. Imagine yourself as the passenger in each situation. Who appears more confident? Who would you rather drive with? Most problems require minimal effort to resolve.

* Get over it. Fucked up a conversation with that hot girl in your class? Get over it. Had an awkward greeting with a coworker? Get over it. Give yourself a brief period of analysis for every negative interaction you have. Look at what you did wrong, learn from it, and then forget the interaction happened. I had a few important realizations about a year and a half ago, when I was fairly unhappy. 1) Every emotion is contained in my consciousness. 2) I have partial control over my consciousness. 3) I can influence my emotions to a certain degree. Learn to reject negative feelings and accept positive ones. Don't let yourself fall into that self-pity that feels so strangely good -- it is ultimately dangerous. Become an optimist.

* Push yourself. Talk to everyone you can. Work out until you can't work out any longer. If you see a possible area of self-improvement, work hard on fulfilling the positive maxim of the trait that represents that area. Learn from those around you at every opportunity.

A few important points: 
Certain advice above may not work for you. Don't get discouraged. Everyone thinks differently. Just because you don't fit one definition of a stereotypically confident person does not mean that you aren't confident. 
Confidence is cyclical -- the more confident you become, the more people will treat you as if you are confident. This leads to increased confidence. 

I feel like I could write about these topics forever. Realize that your potential is not limited. Realize that you are in control of your brain. Realize that your current confidence level is not indicative of your future confidence self.

If you have any questions, ask me. I'm no George Clooney but I feel that I have a good perspective on confidence.",,False,self,t5_2rmn5,False,,,True,t3_xnj8q,http://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/xnj8q/some_confidence_tips/,

I've struggled with self-confidence my entire life. 

Last week at work, my manager and I were having a heated discussion (schedule changes and such) when he tried to leave the room before the conversation was finished I just snapped **""Get back here! Don't you fucking walk away from me when I'm talking to you!""** I yelled at him. A back and forth yelling matched ensued. 

Later that day, after we both cooled off, he asked me not to speak to him like that anymore. He said it made him feel so small and insecure. He said he felt like he was back in the Army getting yelled at by his superior officer. 

The rest of that evening, I've never felt more Alpha in my life. It was visible to everyone. People moved out of my way when I walking down the street. I hung out with some friends and a girl in the group I always considered well out of my league was clearly into me. She was blushing and twirling her around when talking to me. Her body language was screaming she was into me. I played in totally cool. 

The next day, that confidence was gone. 

It's like a drug. I want it back. I've heard ""fake it till you make it"" but it's just not the same. No matter how hard I try, I can't create that feeling inside my chest like I had before.

I'm new to reddit so I don't even know if I'm in the correct subreddit, but this is kind of a combination of a cool story/inspiration/offmychest but is ultimately about confidence so I decided to put it here. Have mercy, mods. 

I know this picture is currently on the front page. I saw it there. I don't know how to ""x post"" or whatever. Anyways. I read that quote and it blew my mind. I grew up in an extremely christian home, went to an even more extreme christian school, and have lived my life in fear and unconfidence. Growing older I've developed more as a person and am quite good at faking and portraying confidence, and I come across as a confident alphamale but on the inside I have basically no confidence. As I said, I put on a great show; along with my 6'5"" muscular frame, it's pretty easy for anyone else who sees me or interacts with me to believe that show. I now go to a public university and am no longer a Christian - I don't think (it's so much harder than you think to stop believing that nonsense after being brainwashed with it for 20 years). I think I'm agnostic, but I don't know. I don't want to go as far as say I'm atheist. 

ANYWAYS, I was reading that quote and got to the point where it said, ""I am my own God."" I've heard that said a million times, anywhere from overhearing some random person say it to hearing it said in movies. It wasn't until just now that it hit me, and it hit me like a bus. 

There is no higher power. IF there is, it is not involved or apparent in daily life. Therefore, I am my own God. I make my own decisions and there is no force on this planet that can fuck me from within or bless me  either. I've lived life either fearing or trying to please ""God"" and either intentionally or unintentionally based all my actions under that philosophy. 

It finally hit me that none of that crap exists. I am my own God. I am my own creator. I am everything that I have done and everything that I will ever do and it's all up to me and nothing else. There's nothing holding on to me or playing puppet with my actions. I have to be the one to make my own decisions for me and for what I want. This just makes me so much more confident for some reason. I almost feel free. I do feel free. I think I feel free. I'm still trying to climb out of my deep deep canyon of brainwash. But I feel more free and hope that I can continue to feel more and more free. 

I am the architect of my own destiny, and I have the power. I will leave you all with this quote:

""I am the man responsible for who I am. When I look in the mirror each day, I stare my creator in the eyes. I am responsible for what I have and will become, I am accountable for what I will or will not accomplish. I believe in myself, I bow to no man and my only critic of any consequence has walked every mile of this journey in my size thirteens.""",,False,self,t5_2rmn5,False,,,True,t3_17js9g,http://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/17js9g/this_picturequote_just_bulldozed_my_brain/,

1. I assume that to not need the approval of other people would make me a sociopath or an uncaring clod. 
2. People who don't care about what other people think are basically autistic. Not only are they morally vile, they are certainly not likely to succeed in life. You have to be a politician to get anything: friends, girlfriends, success, anything. 
3. Caring about what other people think, about their feelings, is how you get people to like you. People like people who care about others, not selfish people. 
4. Being decent and ethically good (i.e. the superior man) means that you are polite. Dr. House-style ""telling it like it is"" is Asperger's syndrome, or just flimsy excuse to mean at people.
5. Being polite means you have to be Lincolnian in letting things go, forgiving people who yell at you, not getting angry yourself. Getting angry means you've lost. 
6. Therefore, being polite involves a certain amount of deception or at least soft-pedaling your honest self -- which if people knew about it, would freak. 
7. A BIG ONE FOR ME: Nothing about me or what I do is real unless other people say it's real too. The Talmud says ""If one man says you are a donkey, ignore him. If two say so, buy a saddle."" I can think I'm handsome all I want but until a majority of people I know say it or agree with it, it's not real. 
8. I'm not a good person if others don't say so. 
9. When I try to change myself, I need 
10. An existence where I only give approval to myself sounds like a horrible, lonely, isolated existence. I can't imagine being the main support of myself. It seems solipsistic and so open to self-delusion. After all, haven't famous assholes always believed in themselves, even when people told them to the contrary? 
11. If I give myself self-approval (assuming that's even possible) I will be even more isolated than I already occasionally feel. 
12. Whatever I say about getting approval from people in general goes double for getting approval from attractive women. They are the carriers of value when it comes to masculinity and social value as a whole. No matter how successful, smart, good I am, I still need them to think I am worthwhile before I actually feel so.
13. Even when girls have told me they think I am worthwhile, for some reason it's never enough. There's always some mitigating factor that negates their acceptance. Usually it's the fact that I've successfully deceived them into thinking I am attractive and special (see 7). The fact that I've deceived them not only means they don't know the real me, it means that they also were dumb enough to be deceived by me. 
14. Internet particular: whenever I discuss personal stuff online, I get really anxious to read the responses. I'm afraid people will think I'm annoying or tactless and so I have to psych myself up to read the replies from you guys on Reddit, even though people have been super-supportive so far.

Not only that, I want to be a better human being.  I don't know how many people here have read Carnegie's *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, but one thing he states in there is to take a genuine interest in others.  Listen to people, smile, enjoy what they're saying, talk about things they like, and be the one asking questions as opposed to answering.  All these things will give you more value and make you more valuable in other peoples' eyes.  

On top of this, the thing that has really boosted my confidence is paying it forward.  We humans were made to construct, not destruct.  We like making order as opposed to disorder.  I have been on a trip to Connecticut and have randomly been helping in any way I can.  Sometimes it's adding a genuine compliment in a conversation, sometimes it's giving someone some money for whatever they need.  It can be talking to other passenger on the plane to comfort them, or it can be tipping someone who is not used to tips.  I don't need to say all the ways I've been paying it forward, but I'm glad I have been.  My confidence has boosted when someone says thank you and I ask for nothing in return.  I'm serious, try this.  There's a trick though:  ***YOU CAN'T DESIRE ANYTHING IN RETURN!!!***  You have to do this knowing it will only better another person.  In doing so, you will find you have a generosity that is only in films and books.  You will be that person spoken of because of your generosity.  Let's not forget:  It's not just confidence we want in life, it's a legacy.  What will your legacy be?  Give, give, and give some more.  Only then will you feel truly confident.  It can't be about taking because only you get to go to your grave.  It has to be about giving every bit of yourself.  Disagree all you want, but my challenge to this subreddit is to start with one kind gesture a day for a week and build up to two or three a day.

I'll go first. ,martinzky,24,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/15cfxj/how_has_this_subreddit_helped_you_personally_ill/,"Hi to whoever is reading this. I've been coming by this subreddit for a while now - I struggle with confidence issues, big time. Or so I have been at least for many years now, but during the last few weeks my confidence have improved, and it has done so largely because of this subreddit. There's so much great advice here, and I'd like to share what I've found to work for me.

I now **hold eye-contact** way more, it helps a lot, and I don't feel as submissive as I used to because of it.

**I speak up**, its getting more and more natural to do so, but I've been a low-talker and a mumbler most of my life so I find it challenging at times. Lately I've had less people saying ""huh? Can you say that again?"" to me, which is good, because I felt insecure when people constantly either didn't hear me at all, or when they did they misunderstood me because of my low talking.. 

**I speak more slowly, a tiny bit more pause between each word, and this gives what I say more impact**. I've been getting more laughs, and more appreciation from what I've said. 

**I don't constantly second-guess my choices anymore**, I feel more confident in what I decide to do or say. A lot of my lack of confidence at least was that I had no confidence in myself while talking or doing anything really. This took some time to change. I used to despise everything I said, did, acted upon, you name it. And I just ended up hating myself for it, and my confidence just got lower because I didn't believe in my actions. Changing this has helped so much. Now I try to do stuff because I want to, because its gonna make me feel good, and I'm not gonna change to get the approval of someone else. 

This subreddit has helped me with all of these things. How has it helped you guys?

My social life was flying away, slowly but surely. Most of the girls I talked to I don't talk to anymore.

1370566327.0,23,self.confidence,1ftxpu,I had a bit of a confidence breakthrough today and I thought I'd share what I learned with all of you.,daveybaby32,27,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/1ftxpu/i_had_a_bit_of_a_confidence_breakthrough_today/,"So to preface what I’m about to share with you all, I just wanted to talk about myself a little bit and why I felt the need to post on this subreddit. To briefly describe myself, I’m 20 years old and I never really thought of myself as a guy who isn’t confident. That’s not to say that I ooze confidence and swagger, but I feel like I’ve always been in the middle, every now and then I’ll get flashes of confident brilliance as well as moments where I’m listening to myself thinking “Boy, could you sound like more a pansy talking to this pretty girl?” So suffice it to say, I’ve always been interested in maximizing my confidence highs and limiting my lows, which is why I find myself browsing this subreddit as well as a few other related ones.

Not too long ago I was giving a guy advice on here who asked what to do if he tried to kiss a girl who wasn’t being responsive. I gave a piece of advice regarding confidence that was basically “fake it till you make it.” I thought this was great advice that I was sharing with this fellow in need, but what I found out from another commenter was that I wasn’t really sharing anything tangible. I was taken aback at first, but after a while it made sense to me , after all, when I come on here I try and find quick fixes to my problems, even though those really don’t exist, and I wanted to find a way to really help out.

That was a couple weeks ago, fast forward to today, I woke up early on my day off and found that all my roommates were away at work. It was one of those days where I hopped out of bed literally feeling like a million bucks ready to seize the day. I mowed the lawn, did my laundry and planned on getting a haircut later in the day.

Before my cut I decided to check out reddit and stumbled on this really insightful TED talk which discussed the importance of stretching and making yourself feel big and its effect on one’s self confidence as well as how big of an impact straightening your posture can have. Being someone who is always looking to be as confident possible (I often go out to bars with my pals and we all try and pick up girls, with mixed results), I decided to immediately put all this into effect and even as I write this out, I’m doing my best to keep a good posture which can be tough for me at times since I have a bit of scoliosis.

Anyways fast forward a bit more and I’m walking over to the barber shop, this is where I got my brilliant revelation. What I was trying to do for a while was find an immediate quick boost to my confidence that I could implement as soon as I walked into bars so I could leave with all sorts of exotic women, but really nothing in life ever works like that. I came up with a brilliant confidence analogy on my way to get a trim; confidence is really more of a muscle. You can’t just enter a basketball court and expect to drop unreal shots against stingy defense, right? First you need to hit the courts on your own and practice when no one's around. Confidence is exactly the same thing. I found that since I get a little bit of nerves when I approach beautiful girls that I should first try on something a little easier.

I made the resolution today that I would talk to just about anyone I could and get comfortable. Situations where I would normally not speak to someone because I don’t have to are perfect. They’re no pressure, so I can try out things like starting a conversation and finding out more about a person and in the event I screw up I can just cut it off, it really is the perfect place to practice my social skills with someone who doesn’t even know I’m doing it. This way I know what works and I know that it’s worked in the past and I can feel free to use it when it actually matters.

As I finished this brilliant train of thought I had arrived to the barber, I decided I would do something I’ve never done before and actually try my hardest to maintain a long and fun conversation with the woman cutting my hair the entire 30-ish minutes I was with her. What actually ended up happening was even better than I thought; I ended up engaging 3 of the hairdressers there in a really intense discussion about the latest Game of Thrones episode. Suffice it say, I left that place feeling confident as ever because of what I had just done, not to mention that I was looking great after getting a great haircut.

So that’s my newest resolution, talk to anyone I can in order to hone my ability to approach strangers and getting them comfortable and talking, that literally includes everyone: cab drivers, people sitting next to me in a lecture hall, door to door salesmen whatever. If I don’t have to speak to them it’s even better because no pressure is on me and in the event things start going south or I lose my cool I can just bail, no harm, no foul. After a little while I’ll have gotten so good at chatting people up that models and actresses could be ordering drinks at the bar and I’ll be able to approach them without getting phased whatsoever (I hope).

So that’s what I discovered today, confidence is a muscle that needs constant and regular training in order to be big and ready for game day. Coupled with what I learned about posture, I should have absolutely no problem pulling that number from the next single hottie I lay my eyes on!

Self-confidence has always been an elusive concept to me. Before I delve into that, here’s the context of why I think I’ve had such a hard time with confidence.

Growing up, I didn’t understand the purpose of motivational speeches and posters. I was raised in a religious family, which led me to be very skeptical about adults, my parents, my teachers, and the ones at church. I didn’t trust a lot of their intentions, or what they meant by their attempts to offer perspective. That being said, I was still a very a thoughtful and contemplative kid. It was religion really, which I saw as an unfulfilling comfort for adults such as my parents, which led to my lack of self-faith and perspective. My mother is the most religious, but always talked of it and life in a way that seemed like she was trying to convince herself as well, not just me. My father followed, but with even less conviction. In addition, before I imply anything to the contrary, that my parents are very nice people. They were good parents, not great, but good. However, they were unresponsive, and failed in a lot of in my formative years. My mother was overbearing and my father was apathetic and probably couldn’t relate to me (a common situation, I know).

Nevertheless, I do not blame my religious upbringing and parents for my lack of confidence alone. In fact, I know that a lot about confidence comes down to willpower and deliberate alterations to self-perception. 

The weird thing is, confidence shouldn’t be an issue with me. I’m over 6’0”, have what many would label as a “pretty-boy” face and demeanor, musical, artistic, and good with kids. Lots of beautiful women, who I think would generally be rated as 10’s, approach me or look my way. Unfortunately, my lack of confidence has kept me from having the guts to talk to these women or even see myself under a positive light. 

Overall, I don’t fully know why I don’t have the confidence I want. It’s been wearing me down for years and I’ve long felt life to be a chore.

It's a giant 90 degree learning curve.

However, if I get past this, it could put me on the path to where I want to be in life.

I've been procrastinating for 2 years, escaping the world by playing on games, and not being productive.

So last week, I cracked, I decided to learn the tools that I need to make my own games, or at least give me a shot at getting into the industry.

I managed to work out how the 3D programme Blender works, how games are built, and found a small unpaid position doing the Audio for a non commercial game being built.

Here's the issue, that big game team has asked me to use a program I have never used before.

I have 2 weeks to work out how to create a sound and implement it, but I honestly feel like giving up.
I honestly feel myself turning away from it all and saying screw it...too much effort.

So eventually they went off and I've had the past year getting myself out of all that and getting back in contact with one friend from school. I kinda relied on her a lot to get me through loads of my issues and it just feels like its a friendship based on my faliures and her trying to fix them.

I sometimes even feel ashamed, if it's not the way my hair is styled, it's about my clothing, if it's not about the clothing it's about the way i walk. 
I've never went up to a girl by myself, every time i did hook up it was initiated by the girl at that moment. Now might some of you think, wtf is his problem?

I began to get sick of feeling worried about what others thought about me, and realized that it was holding me back a lot socially, so I decided to make a change.

**1. Working out**

Seriously, this is such a major factor in me maintaining my confidence nowadays.  Whenever I begin to feel insecure, nothing pushes that feeling away better than going for a nice run and doing some strength training.  It's hard to feel bad about yourself after you work your ass off.  It's basically free, unless you want to go to a gym, and incredibly effective.

**2. Clothing**

I used to wear clothes that really weren't for me.  I thought I was cool wearing skater t-shirts (even though I was the farthest thing from a skater), cargo pants, sagging jeans, and huge hoodies.  Eventually, I realized I looked like a dumbass to everyone else.  I talked to my family and we agreed on buying a new wardrobe that was a bit more pleasing.  Lots of button down shirts, sweaters, nice shirts, khakis, properly fitting jeans, Sperry shoes, etc.  It's a strange feeling once you change your style.  You almost feel like an entirely new person.  After I changed my clothing, I felt awesome, and because I felt awesome, I really did become awesome.  I was more confident, happy, and overall a better person to be around.

I was a skinny kid, scared of getting beaten up by other kids, and pretty miserable right through high school.

I'm 46 YO, on various meds, and getting sick because I'm in such bad shape. Lately I've learned that my lack of confidence, partly driven by ADHD and fear of other guys who could be stronger than me, and who knows what else, has been too much of a burden to carry around with me, and I've taken it on myself to reverse things. I don't lack confidence anymore. I am now all-powerful, I believe in myself. I am tough as nails. And I can curse like a fucking sailor. If you have a problem with that, it's your problem, not mine. Lack of confidence was killing me, and I'm putting an end to it. I am fucking nuclear.

It came time to face my old nemesis, The Gym, where I was always the 90-pound weakling, humiliated by other men. I needed to get over my history and fears, get up, and go. On Sunday, I joined. Today, I met with a trainer (who would have been big enough to scare me, but fuck you, nothing scares me anymore.) He showed me around. I tried the machines, and did 20 minutes of cardio.

I feel great. Not only from the exercise, no no no, but because I faced a longtime fear of mine, head on, and I conquered it. I'm going back the day after tomorrow.

All throughout high school I have never had a girlfriend, never hooked up with a girl in any way, or even kissed a girl. I'm just starting college and I thought it would be different in a new environment but no, I find myself doing the same shit I did in high school ,just sitting in class looking at a pretty girl just wishing some day I could be with someone like her. And day goes in and day goes out and all I do is say today is not the right day to talk to her, maybe tomorrow and then I go home, feeling like a failure. Also when I do manage to talk to a girl I always end up talking to her like a full on acquaintance.

One time, this girl that I liked was messaging me on Facebook, she had recently broken up with her boyfriend (which somehow when girls have boyfriends I can actually talk to them) and she obviously liked me, and she was beautiful, after a few days of chatting she gave me her number and she told me to call her some time, the days went by and days turned into weeks the same way, saying not today maybe tomorrow, it got to a point where I guess she got tired of waiting and deleted me from Facebook. Even though I knew she liked me and I liked her I kept on finding excuses not to call her and now all i do is regret it.

Also, I'm scared of sex (let me explain) It's not that it grosses me out or anything or the actual act of having sex terrifies me, not at all I love the concept of having sex. I think that if a goddess came up to me and asked me to have sex with her I would get so nervous I wouldn't even be able to respond. For example, just tonight I was at a get together at this girls house (FYI: my friend (who is a guy) invited me to this) and somewhere through this course of events my friends got this fat girl to ask me if I wanted her to suck my dick, and I was not attracted to her in the slightest, but I got so nervous that I started slurring my words and talking really quite, and I could not control it, and even though I didn't like her just the fact of her being a girl and talking about blowing me got me all nervous. I could not for the life of me just get my shit together and tell her that I was not interested and move on.

I have very little friends that are girls and I need help just with having confidence around them. Any advice for getting over this or any stories would really help.

PS. sorry for the novel.

I have been offered my dream job - teaching English in Japan - I've actually posted about this before while I was interviewing.

Here's a breakdown of what's going on:

Good:

- I have an MA TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of other Languages).

- I've taught abroad before in France.

- I've wanted to do this since college.

Bad:

- It's in a small town (which isn't that bad, I'll be forced to practice my Japanese more).

- I'll have to drive to the schools I teach at (I'm not keen on driving on the other side of the road).

- Further, I'll have to drive in the snow (something I've never done before).

- I am giving up an excellent job here in the US and taking a huge pay cut to take this job.

- My Japanese is horrible!!

My thoughts:

I'm afraid of freaking out (yes, I know it's a spiral... being afraid of being afraid). I'm scared of winter coming and getting depressed. I'm worried I'll drive my car off a cliff after hitting an ice patch. And I loathe myself for all of this.

I've worked far too hard to pass on this job simply because I'm scared witless about driving in the snow. And it's stupid for me to judge this job based on what weather will be like 4 months of the year (I'm prepared to deal with the hot, humid, summer months).

I want this so much... but my heart is racing like mad... I'm turning 40, and much like George in Seinfeld, I've told myself it's time to do the opposite of what I'd usually do... which is back out and stay in my safe job.

I feel there's a lot to learn about myself, the world, and new skills to acquire (like driving in Japan / in the snow), learning how to really winterize a house, improve my Japanese, etc. 

And, like my Japanese professor told me last night:

""There's no place more beautiful than Japan in October.""

I had never done so before, and no one in my family ever rides roller coasters (which is probably why I was afraid of them). But, I went to the amusement park, and forced myself to ride as many as I could. And you know what? It was awesome, and now I'm not afraid of them anymore.

In my life, however, there are many things that I fear, and have anxiety over. Stupid things, like meeting new people, making good impressions at my work, my health (I suffered from hypochondria for a while). But I decided that the only way I can get rid of my fears are to face them head on. With that in mind, I'm going to try facing my fears more often, particularly my social fears, which have held me back from friends and relationships all my life. Yesterday I was invited to a camping trip, and I knew that there was only going to be one person who I was friends with that would be on the trip. I declined at first, but I am going to accept the offer regardless, even if I don't know anyone there. 

I figure, what's the worst that can happen? If they all hate me and I don't make any friends there, then so what? It's only one day of camping, and I'll probably forget about it in a week or two. But say I make a good impression? Well, maybe I'll make some friends, and some new connections? I'm afraid of meeting new people, but I'm going to force myself to do it anyways, and maybe then it will get easier in the long run.

It's as if I don't think I look good enough or am the one person who looks different in any non specific outing (it's a very difficult feeling to explain). In a way, I lost the weight for my health but I believe I really did it for the attention I would get from the opposite sex. Lately, I have learned that looks don't count for much if your constantly stuck in your head thinking in about what you want to say/ should say/ could say etc. 

I was wondering if there is anyone out there who has also lost weight and managed to adapt to social interaction.

I'm a small-medium dude. But I don't see myself that way. I want the stuff big tall hair on their head men get.

How can I avoid being the comic relief character and instead be the sexy male lead in the story of my life?

I have small hands, small wrists, small feet (size 7.5).

I hate it, I've always been insecure about these things because I was teased a lot in middle school and never got much bigger.

I've gone through phases where I'd become very fit through running/weight lifting/kickboxing only to stop and go ""what's the point, I'll never be any taller or bigger?""

Ultimately I have this desire to be wanted and respected by others- which I am most certainly not. I won't say I get bullied, but no one is calling me to be their friend. I've had girlfriends, but I get rejected constantly.

There's a cute chick, we've talked last year in class before, we don't talk anymore because she's not in any of my classes. 

She hangs out a the smoker's pit (She doesn't smoke, has friends there). One of friend's in particular, is a tall dude with a big mouth and likes to start shit. 

The only time I could talk to her is if I go to the pit, or if I'm at her locker (which won't be for long, because she goes to class late and our classes are far apart). In any possible case, I'll have to deal with Loud mouth. 

I'm not scared of the guy, but I'm *REALLLY* shy around girls (I'm Raj from BigBangTheory). I don't want Loud Mouth to come and act like an asshole because it would screw me over horribly. 

No, she's not dating him whatsoever, but I want to ask her out (preferably before V-day)  because she's been on my mind..a lot. 

What do I do? :c

UPDATE : Apparently, she likes another guy that NOT in my school. I'm pretty sad because I doubt i'll even have a chance with her now ;c

I love him to death, and we have a great time. There's a major flaw in our friendship that really affects me thigh: he is the most stubborn person I know.
Whenever we get into any debate about something, he HAS to win. And he has this uncanny and annoying ability to turn anything I say around on me. I understand that I'm not a very good debater, and he knows it too; he uses it to his advantage all the time. Whenever he wins any argument, I look like a fool, and now I'm his best friend who ""doesn't have a lot of common sense."" Whenever he feels like he is even remotely beginning to lose, he immediately tries to change the subject, or even worse, accuse me of being weird or annoying because i'm arguing with him.
Again, we have our good times, and it's awesome living with him, but this stuff has lowered my confidence and self-esteem so much. Now, I feel like I'm wrong ALL the time, even when he's not around. I constantly avoid standing up for myself due to the fear of being put down again. All of my opinions feel invalid, and my perspective and likes/dislikes has started to become just like his and not my own; if I don't, I would of course be wrong.
He also jokes around often, calling me an idiot and telling me to shut up. Even though I know he's joking, this doesn't help much. I've started joking at myself  so I don't have to hear it from him.
I know I need to stand up for myself and talk to him about this, but trust me, he would make me look wrong again. There was one time where I did try to stand up for myself, but he immediately turned it around on me, aggressively, and accused me of being a bad friend and saying he's wrong all the time and not supporting him. After not knowing what to say, I immediately agreed and began to believe that myself. Now, whenever we talk about the ""dark times"" of our friendship, the whole conversation is about what I did wrong and me being the bad person at that time.

I'm so tired of him putting me down, but if I try to talk to him about it, he's only going to put me down more. I CANNOT seem to win with him. Any tips/advice on this stubborn of a best friend?

Madeline Koller, aged 19, college sophomore majoring in natural sciences and geographic information systems. MTF transsexual currently in transition (I pretty much live full time as a woman now and can start HRT at any time as soon as my income improves).

It kills me to ask others for help, to let people in on my problems. That's really the whole issue here. I was going to an out-of-state university. Things happened, I couldn't handle it, and I moved home. The college I'm going to now is a community college which is cheaper, but I'm still continually putting myself in debt, unfortunately (thankfully 80% of my units transferred or I'd be screwed). Ever since I moved back home I've been looking for work; with any luck I'll find something in the next two or three months (it's been six months already). To make matters worse, I have bipolar disorder, for which I've been medicated for the past two years. That in itself increases my stress and anxiety exponentially.

I have NO GODDAMNED IDEA how to convey to others, even to my own family, that I'm not strong enough to do this on my own. I feel like, to even tell my parents that I'm this vulnerable, would put serious pressure on them and I can't bear to do that. It's bad enough they've had to deal with my bipolar disorder, my transsexuality and the subsequent breakdowns I've had over the past six months as it is.

But to be honest, my mind can't really handle it. I can't handle this putting myself into debt, this being unable to find work, this constant juggling of fiances, this continual struggle while those around me seem to be able to handle the real world effortlessly. It's too much to swallow all at once. I don't get how people can do it so easily.

I just wish someone would actually take the time to work with me, so that I don't feel so alone in what is truly an uphill battle. My therapist is really only there to vent to and my psychiatrist is only there to prescribe drugs. I need more than that. And to do that, I need to be able to, well, ask someone if they can take the time to work with me.

I guess that's it, really. That's my current situation: needing help understanding how life works but not knowing how to ask for it. I don't know how to better put it. ",,False,self,t5_2rmn5,False,,,True,t3_19azaa,http://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/19azaa/how_do_i_ask_others_for_help/,

The kicker is that I just CANNOT seem to do this, no matter how hard I try I cannot force my mind not to keep focusing on the bad, I have tried to do this with therapists via CBT and Mindfulness, neither worked, same with individual efforts.

I now have a job that actually uses my degree. So I guess I should feel fortunate; Though there are times I do not like my job. I am actually preparing to take my gre (I am fairly confident I will do well).

In college and before, I used to play a lot of video games. I think the main video game would have to have been WoW. I played WoW off and on for like 6 years, usually playing competitively in arena (quite well too at like a 2.2 k rating ~top 5% of the wow community). I also played starcraft 2 a lot and was a platinum/diamond player (maybe top ~30%). So I like to be competitive.

Now to bring this back to reality. I feel like I wasted a very large portion of my life playing video games that are only fun for some time and then I have to come back to reality (I actually quit WoW because it started to feel like a second job). It kind of sucks. I feel like I have a very hard time relating to people, especially girls. To me, I think this is the link in my life that I need. To find a wonderful woman for me, and great friends. Most of my friends have moved away too.

What kind of hobby would you recommend? I used to fence in high school. I think I was mediocre at it, but I think with practice and hard work I believe I can do well. I particularly do not mind working hard.

Edit: Oh and I might add that I have been running to try to get back into shape as well. I am so far working on training for a 5k. I can run like 2.4 miles now in 24 minutes, so I think I am doing well there too.

I am in a travel of self-improving with myself, and i'm working really hard for it. In 9 mounths i've changed quite a lot.

I wasnt able to talk easily with people, and my confidence with girls was zero. With this trip i've worked myself at a good level. 

One thing anyway, is keep strugling me, and i hate it so much, it's causing me to lose confidence a lot of times, when im in front of people...

i just can't stop biting my NAILS... i don't know how many times i tryed it...

So, i think this 1 is the right sub-redit to ask, because this problem is, as i told you already, destroying my confidence, i fell scared by the look of the people...

In the past, it happened few times, that people looked at my nails and asked me what was a problem with me... i felt so ashamed...

Anyway now, i'm trying to fix this problem, but it's really hard... 

So im asking for your help.

But while doing these I noticed that some changes about me are developing, yet very slowly, just the way I like it.

- Exercise: This is typical for a confidence booster. I've put off weights a long time ago because I looked at it like a burden. Couple months ago I finally said to myself that I will be more dedicated to the iron, and I'm glad now. I have something to wake up in the morning for and can slowly see the changes in my attitude and body. It also helps to have a run outside, it helps to make you feel less lethargic if your an internet dweller like me. Run for at least 15 minutes, and then if you feel confident enough, step it up to 30 minutes and so on.

- Make music or take up an art form: Everyone loves music, right? Right. I don't know the details on why getting involved with music seems to help and better you, but believe me it works! I love electronic music and always wanted to know how the artists and producers did their thing, I happened across Fruity Loops and is possibly the best $100 I ever spent on anything. There's a certain feel of accomplishment you get when you find a sound that...well...sounds good, and putting it in a beat that you can tap your foot to. The best part is that YOU made it! Now, I'm still a noob at it but that doesn't mean there's no room for improvement and to have fun as well ;)
The same can be said for any other kind of music or instrument you're into. Whether your a rock guitarist who wants to make tasty riffs or a singer who wants to nail that high note, by all means do it up. And if music isn't in your deal, take up some other art form like drawing or pottery. Just take up something that you want to do creatively, it helps to have a hobby that you want to excel at and keeps you busy.

- Procastinating is normal for everyone, but try to avoid it: My first semester in college was pretty messy, it seemed intimidating at first. And when homework or an essay came around, I just put it off for later  and say ""bleh I'll get this done eventually"". I barely passed that semester and failed 1 class (philosophy). It was when my 2nd semester came around and I started to realize how much better this was then high school and there were a bunch of ways to improve myself more, knowledge and work-efficient wise. I decided that I'm going to be doing the necessary reading and work that needs to be done ASAP more seriously. Thanks to actual studying, not only do I pass my tests and quizzes, but I know some of my material inside-out. It's also nice to lend a hand to a fellow student who needs help. 

Like I said before, I slowly notice changes in my life when you keep doing the things that will help you in the long-run. Like someone said before ""Its not about the destination, but the journey"". I'm still a skinny looking fella, not a great musician, and sometimes school can be pressuring. But minor improvements are good improvements. I gain a little bit more muscle now and then, I still get that accomplishment high when I make a sound I dig, and as long as I work hard then school will go great. I knew I was a little bit more confident when I was talking to a girl at school, and I'm usually nervous as hell around women! But this time, I actually got to look her in the eyes and be myself. It's little things like that that show improvement in self-confidence.

Hope this helps for anyone who reads it. This is a good idea for a sub-reddit and would like to see it grow more!

I'm very introverted as well, which I assume has something to do with the previously mentioned. 

I like the idea of being able to be social and being able to let loose but i can't bring myself to do it and It pisses me off sometimes. I know down the rode I will regret these years of youth confined in my bubble.

So Reddit, I ask you what can I do. I've read through many of the posts on this subreddit so far but I think a personal response could help more. 

Things I lack confidence in
-Driving. I still have my permit and it's almost been two years. I don't think I'm scared of harm I can cause to myself but rather consequences that come with messing up, or causing some other driver to get mad at me. ( I hate getting mad at).

-Work. I dislike work but it's more because there is a social aspect in there where I need to talk to the customers. My brother is my boss and is there when I talk to them, I'd prefer not to say anything that he gets mad at me for. He gets mad at little things I do, and things I've said that he has never told me not to say, he assumes I know the same amount about the business as he does, although he has been doing it for much longer.

-My looks. When I look at myself in the mirror I compare myself to other good looking people I know or don't know, I find things wrong with the way I look and that brings my confidence level down. Although I have been told I'm pretty good looking, it doesn't mean anything because I don't see it.

There is more but can't think of it right now. Also sorry if its a bit scattered and hard to read. Thanks reddit!",,False,self,t5_2rmn5,False,,,True,t3_19i5km,http://www.reddit.com/r/confidence/comments/19i5km/self_confidence_in_regards_to_my_life/,

But I was insanely unhappy of my life. The city, the people, the work ... I was stuck for life, or so I thought.   
  
I decided to print out a date on a calendar and that was my exit day. I took a leap of faith and did everything I wanted and got out of the life I hated. I was so proud of myself.   
  
This was 2 years ago. I also did something else, I packed up my life and moved to a foreign country with no plans on looking back. Since then I've been living a pretty bohemian lifestyle blowing my life savings in the process. I have no regrets here.   
 
My goal is to open another company here, something small, something where I can live a more simple life than I was living. But I'm afraid. I have no heart. I've always been aware of fear and that it really means nothing, but I've still always been unconfident at first. However, I have always found away around it, and once I passed it I'm fine. But I'm starting to doubt I can do it again.  
  
I believe anyone is capable of doing anything. But I'm stuck. To put it crudely I guess I'm being a pussy. But being like this could ruin my future and I could really use some advice.
