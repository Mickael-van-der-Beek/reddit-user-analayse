**THINGS A COMEDIAN'S WEBSITE SHOULD HAVE:**

* **upcoming performances** (weirdly often called ""tour dates"" even if it's only three free shows and not actually a ""tour"".)
* **an audio player** letting users listen to some free audio tracks from your album/podcast
* **merch store** (for selling digital &amp; physical goods like albums, t-shirts, etc)
* **bio / press kit page**
* **a ""contact me"" page** (with a contact form that integrates with a mailing list service like Mailchimp/Constant Contact/etc)
* **social media integration** (it should be easy for your fans to both FOLLOW you and SHARE your content without leaving your website, I'm thinking podcast &amp; FB &amp; twitter &amp;youtube &amp; tumblr &amp; reddit should cover 90% of comedians online social activity)
* **mobile responsive design** (your site shouldn't look crappy on smartphones and tablets, this is 2013 and if your audience is &lt;30yo they will likely want to experience your comedy from a mobile device if given the option)
* **a blog**
* **a ""site map"" or ""archives""**

His dog Loona, immortalized in a viral video of Loona biting a sprinkler stream, was killed when he was hit by a car chasing a deer into the road. This inspired his ""Deer Suck"" bit.

He used to attend prostitutes regularly, which is probably where he became lifelong friends with L'il Jimmy Norton.

He wrote for Whoopi Goldberg's stand-up act.

He hosted a series for PBS called ""Short Cuts"" that showcased independent short films, including his own.

He had a nervous breakdown and cried during the taping of the ""Lucky Louie"" episode ""Kim Moves Out"" upon realizing that how close to his real marriage the episode hit home. He returned to the series a week later and rewrote the episode and the rest of the series to be closer to his real marriage and feelings, which informed his subsequent stand-up act and first hour, Shameless.",,False,,t5_2qrp8,False,,,True,t3_kbnay,http://www.reddit.com/r/StandUpComedy/comments/kbnay/6_things_you_actually_didnt_know_about_louis_ck/,

1311441837.0,109,self.StandUpComedy,ixrg0,"Saw Dave Chappelle perform last night, here is my detailed review. ",Taniras,121,12,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/StandUpComedy/comments/ixrg0/saw_dave_chappelle_perform_last_night_here_is_my/,"I was at the Zo's Comedy Groove charity show yesterday and was extremely disappointed and frustrated. Not at Dave Chappelle, but at the crowd. The hecklers were absolutely relentless. I know his performance is going to get a lot of bad press and publicity so I wanted to come out and clarify a few things in order to put the whole situation in perspective. Dave Chappelle is still as great as ever, it's the audience that has changed for the worse. 

Dave Chappelle on stage: He had a really calm and relaxed demeanor. He was completely lucid and wasn't going to let anything bother him. Any time someone would shout something or heckle him he didn't respond with emotion or anger.  At one point in the show he even smoked a cigarette on stage. A few times he checked his text messages. He made it clear he wouldn't let anything bother him (Even though it seemed like this was extremely hard to accomplish). Later in the show he mentioned that his son was in the audience and said he was staying up on stage to teach a lesson to his son. He said that the more he got heckled, the more he felt like staying and that he had all the time in the world. His set was suppose to last for 22 minutes, he ended up staying on stage for around 55 minutes only to be cut off by the DJ. In those 55 minutes he was only able to perform 1 joke. The rest of the time was spent responding to hecklers. 

The audience: Terrible. Absolutely rude and obnoxious. For the most part, everyone seemed to be on Dave's side. People kept yelling nonstop ""We love you Dave"", ""Come back and do you show"", ect. This might sound flattering at first, but it gets really fucking annoying when your 30 minutes into the show and people are still yelling this type of shit. Sometimes people would yell things that didn't even make sense. Any moment of silence was seen as an opportunity by an audience member to yell something stupid. You also had the bad audience members that would yell at him to get off the stage or ""Tell some jokes so we can enjoy ourselves"". Chappelle simply laughed it off and told them they could leave. 

Chappelle was the last to perform and he was slated as a ""surprise guest"". Already 5 or 6 other comedians went before him without any incidences. When he was introduced and walked on stage everyone stood up clapping and cheering. Only comedian I've ever seen that was greeted with a standing ovation. It seemed like it would be the start of a great show but that wasn't the case. I was really disappointed at how the audience was acting. Chappelle couldn't talk for a few seconds without getting interrupted by some idiot yelling some the crowd. It's impossible to perform comedy under these circumstances. 

Once crowd sat down, the cell phones and video cameras were immediately brought out. Everyone in the audience had their cell phone or video camera  pointed at him within the first 30 seconds. This wasn't a small comedy club typesetting either. This was an arena with hundreds of people. It was like a sea of cameras and Chappelle had yet to even speak. You can expect to see tons of videos uploaded from the show within the next few days. Many of people who heckled Chappelle and bantered with him back and forth openly had their cameras out filming his reaction. 

It was clear that all the cameras recording his every reaction bothered him but he tried his best to let it not get to him. Comedians usually dislike being recorded and always request that people not film them before the shows as was the case here. Chappelle pleaded with the audience on a few occasions to put the cameras away. He mentioned that he didn't want to make his big comeback on youtube.That didn't stop the audience though.

As I said before, many of the people who were heckling him were recording him too. Most of those sitting in the front row were filming and heckling him from literally 5 feet away. He spent the first 10 minutes of his set just going back in forth with a young couple in the front row that kept yelling shit at him and recording him with their camera. These people were complete assholes and were largely responsible for the deterioration of the rest of the show. Chappelle got distracted and was just going back and forth with them. He kept his cool but you could tell he was extremely pissed. 'It's a good thing you bought tickets because I would have never stopped for a second to say a word to you on the street' he told them. All the while this couple was pointing their camera at him and cheering like idiots at every word directed toward them by Dave. Part of the problem was Chappelle giving them too much attention which you could tell they were thriving for. Later on Chappelle started smoking a cigarette on stage and this same couple started heckling him for that as well. At one point, fed up, Chappelle offered them the mic to say whatever they wanted. He pointed it right at them and told them to speak up. This shut them up for a little while but they started back up later on in the show. 

I wondered why this couple hadn't been kicked or escorted out of the show since they were the primary agitators and were completely obnoxious. Turns out they were part of the Seminole tribe that owned the Casino where he was performing at. Go figure.

I have to go to work now but I will added more details and answer questions later on. 

TLDR: The crowed was very large and would not stop yelling random things. It was like everyone was trying to get some type of reaction or attention from Chappelle. He was suppose to perform for 22 minutes, ended up on stage for 55 minues and told only 1 joke.

It looks really desperate when you chat, ""Hey, I made this video you might like!"" You'll get ~50 more hits, and 5000% more hatred toward anything you do in the future. It's not worth it. Use that time to email a website that can actually promote your stuff.

Also, if you've Facebook invited me to your show 24 times in the past two years and I haven't shown up once, stop inviting me. You're doing it wrong. I know it feels proactive when you invite a lot of people, like it's a numbers game, but you're spamming. You know those spam emails you get that you hate? That's you. You're doing that thing you hate. 

If you're funny, people will find you without you having to harass them. If you're not, do what I do and beg them in person.

1339598063.0,61,self.StandUpComedy,uzuqy,My review of Dave Chappelle's stand-up show last night at The Orpheum Theater here in Memphis,daprice82,75,14,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/StandUpComedy/comments/uzuqy/my_review_of_dave_chappelles_standup_show_last/,"If you get a chance to see Dave Chappelle live, do it. But don't pay $62 dollars for it.

If you're gonna charge $62 bucks for a ticket, you need to have some goddamn material ready. Chappelle ""performed"" for about 2 hours and I'd say 85% of it was improvised. He had a few things that were clearly written bits (including one that I had heard before from browsing bootleg YouTube videos of some of his other recent stand-up appearances).

But for the most part, he stood on stage and just reacted to what the crowd yelled out. Which, in a sold-out theater that holds 2,700 drunk, mostly white upper-class frat idiots, is kind of a bad idea.

People yelled out everything. Dumb Chappelle quotes, random shit about his clothes, ""we love you!"", and everything in between. At one point, he started talking about movies, so the crowd just started yelling out random movie titles and he'd give opinions on them.

At any other comedy show, this would be a problem and the comedian would tell them to shut the fuck up and let them do the show. But Chappelle had no show. He kinda HAD to have people yelling out stuff because otherwise, he clearly didn't have much material, so he'd have just been standing there chainsmoking. So while the crowd yelling out shit kinda ruined the show, Chappelle helped it happen because he enabled it instead of discouraging it.

Then there was the flip side. Every time some idiot would yell out something, a hundred other people would scream out ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" which ended up leading to most of the audience just yelling over each other the entire show while Chappelle stood there and just kinda ignored it.

Not to say it wasn't funny...during the times the crowd actually shut the fuck up, he was hilarious, and he DOES play off the crowd really well, but there's a time and place for doing that and last night wasn't it. But I was definitely laughing a lot.

All in all, it was funny, but if he came back again for $62 per ticket, I'll be damn if I even think about going again unless he has a set of actual material and is willing to put his foot down and tell the crowd to stop taking over the show.

In the end, crowds gonna crowd and mob mentality takes over, so when it comes to how the crowd behaved, it was Chappelle's fault entirely. He could have put a stop to it and the show would have been a lot more enjoyable for everybody. But he didn't.

I killed!  They were totally ready to laugh.  I followed the President of the University of Hartford, a guy from Autism Speaks, and a guy and a girl singing songs like ""Let it Be.""  

I opened with, ""You're probably thinking, standup comedy... at a memorial... how's that going to work???  Well that's the same thing I said when Sara asked me to do this.""  

It was smaller than they expected. I think they were shooting for a couple hundred. They probably had ended up with 100ish.  That was kind of too bad.  

I didn't have anybody to film and no place to set my flip so I tried to get the audio on my phone. My phone is a 3 year old droid x soooo... yeah that failed unfortunately. 

But other than that sad fact everybody loved it and I got tons of ""Rachel would have loved it."" compliments which was awesome.

Then Louis CK dropping out of the dinner, although we don't know if the two events are related.

This was from when O&amp;A were fired for airing comments from Homeless Charlie about how he wanted to rape Laura Bush, Queen Elizabeth and Condaleeza Rice. Ladies and gentleman, I give you Louis CK:

""This radio censorship bullshit has got to stop.

Today Opie and Anthony, two guys with a very popular radio show that I have appeared on many times, were suspended for thirty days because of things that were said on the air during their show on XM sattelite radio. And now I hear that they are actually fired. For those of you who haven’t heard it, here is the offending clip…

http://www.breitbart.tv/?p=450

I have to say something about this because I think it is terrible, alarming and part of a trend of censorship which is the most dangerous thing to happen in America in a long time, in my view. I am blown away by how little outcry there has been over this especially among liberals, who are supposed to defend civil liberties, but seem only to do so when the rights of peole with their views are threatened. It makes me really really sick. So I’m goign to say somethign about it. Now I’m going to warn you that I am a terrible writer when I am not writing comedy or dialogue. What follows will be meandering and repetitive and rife with bad spelling and run-on sentances. This is not what I do and I’m only doing it because I think I have to and anyway it’s my website so fuck off if you don’t like it…

One thing I have heard ad nauseum is that this is not censorship because the government didn’t do it. I don’t understand why so many people say this. It doesn’t have to be government censorship to be censorship. If anyone silences anyone because what they said pissed someone off, they censored them. It may not be illegal or a first ammendment issue, but it is censorship. Moreover, we live in a country where corporations run everything and have the government at their beck and call and vice verca. The two are fucking each other in the fetid cunt all day long. So in that world it doesn’t really matter who wielded the axe.

I’ve also heard people say that XM was merely excerizing their right to take these guys off the air because they objected to what was said on their service. The idea that this company is suspending O and A because they are concerned or offended by what they said is a joke. It’s just not the case. they suspended them because other people were offended and applied pressure. I know this because I have been on their show numerous times and MUCH worse things were said about all kinds of people, women and men. the reason this became an issue is because XM and Sirrius are trying to merge. That merger needs Federal approval and it’s on thin ice because it’s clearly a monopoly. They need the Feds to ignore this fact and let them merge so that some rich people will become richer and their subscribers will have to buy new radios. The Fed has been saying int he hearings that they are concerned about sattelite radio running without restrictions or regulations. These assholes at Sirrius and XM are actually going to prove here that they are going to listen when the government wants their content changed simply so they can make money on a stock deal. They are selling out cellestial radio freedom for money. 

THAT is what is at stake here. Now, you may say “Well I don’t care because they will only ever censor this one show for this one reason that is something i enjoy sayign I object to. Of course they will NEVER misuse this channel of influence once it’s been opened. The virus from this will never jump from XM to HBO or podcasting or the internet or blogging. No way.” That’s you talking. And you are wrong. Now, here’s the part where I”m supposed to say “Of course I found the coments on their show regarding the secretary of state and first lady to be deplorable.” Or “While I defend their rights, I whole-heartedly disagree with the deplorable nature of the rape jokes, bla bla bla.” I’m sorry I can’t do that. Because I listened to this clip and it made me laugh. I am a man who hates all violence. I am a man who believes rape is the very worst possible crime. I think it’s worse than murder because murder can actually be justified in certain cases. No one has ever raped in self defense. So yes, rape is horrible. Not just rape of women, by the way, rape of boys too. (rape of men does not exist) \BUt is joking about rape wrong? IN MY OPINION, no way. SO I was not offended by what was said on their show. I think it’s important that I tell you this because the entire point here is that people can interpret things differently. Some people are offended and some aren’t. The reason it’s wrong to take someone off the air for what they said, or to bear pressure on a company to take them off the air, is because even though you might think what they said is wrong, someone else might not think it’s wrong so YOU MIGHT BE WRONG! Of course you should protest when you hear something you find offensive. You shoudl attack speech that you find deplorable. But not silence it or stand by while it is silenced.

I thought the clip was funny.

I also think it’s kind of fucked up how everyone quotes this guy saying “I’d like to fuck that bitch” about condeleeza rice, like that on it’s own is offensive or constiututes rape. What the fuck is wrong, or unfunny, about a homeless man saying “I’d like to fuck that bitch” in regards to that stupid fucking cynical Iraqi-baby-eating-with-a-smile cunt Condeleeza??? And Laura Bush? When he said “I would fuck her to death.” I laughed my ass off. these are horrible people who are ruining the country. And the queen is a proud member of a horrible, horrible family that has been eating poor people for centuries. If some guy who lives in a box in this cruel and wrongful nation can’t have a fantacy about fucking the first lady, then what is this world coming to?""",,False,,t5_2qrp8,True,,,True,t3_qql8q,http://www.reddit.com/r/StandUpComedy/comments/qql8q/louis_ck_this_radio_censorship_bullshit_has_got/,

It's old and tired, and it's so common that nowadays I find the urge to change the channel if a non-white comic comes on stage, because I expect them to just go with ""Black people talk like this, white people talk like this"" bits.

Please tell me I'm not alone in this feeling. While we're at it, any recommended non-white-male comics that aren't guilty of this?

I know Dave Chappelle has a lot of racial themed comedy, but he's refined enough it just doesn't feel like he's rehashing the same old shit.

Hello again. I had the distinct pleasure of meeting you earlier this week after your appearance at The Apple Sisters show. I was wearing the Powell's Books shirt (you're right, it's out of hand there, they've gone too far... I mean, I love books and all but I'm no Burgess Meredith).

I work in sports television for a living and have dealt with superstar athletes for all of my adult life. Getting starstruck is a rare occurrence. But upon meeting you, I was left stammering and at a loss for words. It was the first time I was able to meet a personal hero of mine and I continue to be floored by how gracious and kind you were during our brief exchange. It meant more to me than words can express and still does.

In the few words I was able to intelligibly spit out, I'm glad I was able to impart to you how much you and your work has meant to me over the past few years. Your account of your relationship with your mother in ""You Should Have Told Me"" was truly inspiring. 

But the most influential performance of yours was from one of your monthly shows at Largo in which you discussed the issues you had with being envious with the success of your peers and your difficulty dealing with that. I've experienced similar feelings throughout my career, but the commonality was not what struck a chord with me. It was sitting and watching you be so honest, so open and strongly confront something that was so troubling to you. After that show, there were things in my life that I found the strength to confront, reexamine and then change as a result of you sharing your struggle and (what I hope) subsequent triumph.

I was in a rush Monday evening so I deeply regret that I wasn't able to linger and speak with you more. I anxiously await the opportunity to meet you again and, in the meantime, hope this message finds you well.

Again, thank you for being an inspiration, for being kind, gracious and for helping light the way.

Sincerely,
Nick Zacharczuk

PS - Here is a picture of the show card you signed for me. Thanks again!

1307570993.0,47,self.StandUpComedy,huzvz,"Since there's been a ton of new comics lately, I thought I'd compile a list of tips on breaking past the open mic scene.",Uncoolio,54,7,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/StandUpComedy/comments/huzvz/since_theres_been_a_ton_of_new_comics_lately_i/,"I'm not claiming to be some grand authority on the industry. But I've spent a quarter of my life doing this, and managed to make it to the feature level in around 25 clubs around the country. Since getting hired a common goal among new comics, I figured I could share a few tips I've acquired over years of trial and error. 

Nothing in comedy is absolute, and I'm sure some of reddit's other comics will disagree with a few points, or have their own tips to contribute. But overall, this is the shit I wish I had known when I started.

1) It helps to get familiar with pot and alcohol.

It's not about the creative stimulation, it's about the networking. Comics aren't businessmen. We don't play golf or whatever it is normal people do to network. We go around corners, or into back rooms, and get high. Breaking the law together is a bonding experience. If you're the mc, and you get the headliner stoned, guess who he's going to request the next time he comes back to the club?

Drinking is similar. It lowers inhibitions and makes casual conversation easier. When you first start out, *everyone* is a stranger. Unless you're naturally extroverted and gregarious, some social lubrication is going to help. Plus, the more money you spend at the bar, the more the bartender/waitstaff is going to like you. And they have enormous pull with the who gets booked. Obviously, if you're broke or a recovering alcoholic, this may not be possible - it's far from mandatory - it'll just take a little longer. But if you're the type of person who drinks anyway - it'll help to shift your alcohol budget toward the bar you need to be at anyway.

2) But don't be a fucking idiot about it.

Don't deal drugs out of the club. Don't get shithammered and pick a fight with the doorman, or sexually harass the waitresses. Don't go up to the headliner who doesn't know you and offer to smoke him out - even if it's Doug Benson. If the club owner is super straightlaced, you need to be on your best behavior. Don't be fucked up on stage. From a club owner's point of view, a comic isn't an artist, they're an employee. Are you going to hire someone who's a total fuckup? Match your debauchery to the level of the person you're trying to impress. Drink if they're drinking, smoke if they're smoking - but never be more fucked up than they are.

3) Network all you can, but not above your level.

If you're an open micer, Doug Benson doesn't want to get high with you. Jim Jeffries doesn't want to drink with you. You need to be building relationships with your peers, not pinning celebrities in corners and asking if they saw your set. These guys seem hundreds of open-micers every month, there's nothing you're going to say that makes them go ""I'm gonna take this guy under my wing and make him famous.""

You can generally network one level above you. If you're an open micer, get to know the mc. If you're the mc, hang out with the feature (you can hang out with the headliner too, but don't bug him or try to talk shop).

4) Err on the side of caution.

If you're pushy and annoying, you'll probably be labled as another dipshit open micer. Any local scene is a small world, and a reputation for being a moron can kill your career before it's begun. I've seen open micers who literally had to move to a different city, because their early fuckups got them stuck in open mic hell for five or more years with no chance of moving up. When in doubt, it's better to have someone saying ""I wish he'd hang out more often"" than ""god I wish he'd leave me alone.""

5) Don't ask to move up.

This advice from the old alt.comedy.standup message board, posted by Doug Stanhope. At the lowest level, you've got to prove that you're objectively funny, and consistent enough to maintain it for months or years. If you're truly exceptional, *someone* will notice. It'll be other open micers at first, then the staff, and eventually the club owner will need an mc and you'll be there. If you corner a club owner and start nagging for work, he's going to resent you for putting him on the spot. If you're not at the point where others voluntarily want to see more of you, you're not where you need to be yet.

6) Don't look down on other comics, *especially* people above you.

As an amatuer comic who wants to get paid, you know who your idol should be? Every comic who's getting paid. Because even if you think they're talentless hacks, they've accomplished something you haven't. Dane Cook has an amazing work ethic. Carrot-Top is a super nice guy. Larry the Cable Guy found an ignored audience. Gallagher did something no one else was doing at the time. All of these are valuable skills, and a some points they'll be way more important than being funny. If you see a successful comic, and you hate his material, you need to figure out what else he's doing, and learn from that.

1327533919.0,44,self.StandUpComedy,owr6g,Joke thief among us... confirmed...,oneeighthcuban,59,15,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/StandUpComedy/comments/owr6g/joke_thief_among_us_confirmed/,"Last night I posted, and then deleted, a story stating that there was a joke thief taking jokes from this community and passing them off as his own.  I have contacted this individual, as well as the other comics that I noticed the content was stolen from and encouraged them to contact this person as well to express their displeasure.  

I have this individuals reddit username, real name, and venues he frequents, but I'm deciding to leave it where our conversation ended last night.  He said he got the jokes from his friend, he deleted the information from his page, and said he would never tell them on stage.  Obviously I have no way of confirming this but I have to hope I can take his word for it.  I WILL further pursue this if this happens with this person again.  I can promise you that.  And I think anyone that has been doing this any period of time, joke thievery can destroy you and the relationships you have worked to build.  Yes I know there are always going to be people that steal jokes, but they don't last long (Excluding Mencia).  

So I caution all of you out there creating original content.  I know the feedback is fun to hear from people who love comedy, but maybe think twice before submitting your stuff.  I will no longer be posting my videos here.  I'll just develop my material in the clubs I know and work in.  I encourage you to be careful with what you post as well. 

And a final warning to the person who I know will see this post, that stole the jokes from me and other redditers:  I could send screen shots to the venue that you are booked at with your stolen jokes, along with the videos of myself and the other Redditer.  The evidence is DAMNING to say the least.  I don't want to do this to you.  Who knows why you took them.  But I honestly will do this if it comes to that.  Remember we have videos of our content that pre-date anything you might have, because it is what we have worked so hard to create.  I don't want to have to take this any further, but I will if it means protecting what allows me to make money and get paid to perform.  Don't tell them on stage and we won't have a problem.
