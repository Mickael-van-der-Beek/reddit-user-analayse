At the Leesburg Baker's Dozen mountain bike race (a 13 hour endurance race) we were asked to pack out what we pack in, typical ""leave no trace"" rules.  The race operates on a private, working cattle farm along the Potomac River in Leesburg Virginia.  over 500 racers competed, camped, and enjoyed the weekend on this farm.  I took the first photo about an hour into the race about 10 AM. (actually a screen grab from a gopro)  The second photo when I was breaking down camp at about 10:30 AM the following day, It's from roughly the same spot.   I can honestly say I didn't see any garbage left behind.  There were maybe 3 other campsites still there when I left.  It didn't really strike me as anything, until I remembered what the grounds of every other festival/large gathering of people looks like the following day, and how this was nothing like that.  nobody enforced any rules, or went around telling people to pick up their garbage, they simply notified folks in the pre-race email to please pack out all of their own garbage.  

TL;DR 13 hour mountain bike race, over 500 people spent at least 16 hours on this property, and didn't leave any litter behind.

We all get that this might seem interesting to someone who is riding in this kind of weather for the first time, but very often it is also a sign that you just contributed to ruining a trail.

When the ground is thawing and the weather is wet, the trail will be soft through and through. Your bike sinks in, makes ruts, takes topsoil away. The next time it rains a new puddle forms, and pretty soon the trail needs serious work or it will wash away completely. If you have 10 pounds of trail on your bike after the ride, you are doing it wrong.

People, usually fellow riders and volunteers, spend many hours each spring fixing trails after the winter time, many of which were needlessly damaged by people riding them way too soon. Be smart, ride waterproof gravel trails or just stick to bike paths until the trails are dried out enough.


And to address two things that always get posted in response to this: 

YES I realise that not all trails self destruct in the wet, (some are fairly water proof such as a lot of the PNW and B.C.). But a lot of them certainly do, and I have spend many hours fixing them.

Also, YES, its mountain biking and the trails are supposed to have obstacles and rough surface. That is not what I'm talking about. I'm not dumbing down trails. Having giant mud puddles causes people to ride around them, which widens the trail and causes erosion. That is what's dumbing down your trails.",,False,,t5_2qo3d,False,,,True,t3_1ah998,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1ah998/psa_please_dont_ride_muddy_singletrack/,

people ask all the time how to get better and faster.  developing a rider's eye, learning to read a trail and pick a line, not only makes you faster, but makes the ride more fun.  

a rider's eye takes two things:
1 - knowledge of what your bike can do and the trust in your bike's capabilities, and
2 - a sense of play.  it's not all fitness, ""playing"" on the bike helps you learn how to ride a bike better. 

it seems lots of people, people who have been riding for 10+ years, still treat a full suspension bike like a hardtail and don't realize bikes will roll over stuff, it's what they do.  i don't understand why someone would drop two thousand or more on a full suspension bike and then be afraid to roll over stuff or use all that suspension. 

look at this picture and decide what the best line is

http://i.imgur.com/wToLKGU.jpg

not to the right or left, but straight down the middle.  i ride with people and watch them try to go around the rock that they can just roll over.  don't see it as an obstacle, see it as a ride-able feature. 

thank you /u/LetsTryScience, i'm using your picture to show what i meant. 

this is the line i mean.  http://i.imgur.com/jIqUQ5W.jpg

look at this section of trail, where would you ride?

http://i.imgur.com/KFwwK10.jpg

 everyone wants to squeeze through which ends up bending a derailleur and scratching a leg.   the line is, again, over the rock.  

http://i.imgur.com/hIPtILx.jpg

people think they have to stay on the dirt, but you don't.  this is where the sense of play comes in.  what if you rode on the side of something, or over something?

know that your bike will roll over stuff, trust your bike, and don't see obstacles in the trail, see a cool feature OF the trail.  ",,False,,t5_2qo3d,1372369605.0,,,True,t3_1h5byv,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1h5byv/developing_a_riders_eye/,

I see a lot of posts about disc brake issues. So as a lifer shop mechanic I feel I can share a few observations that I have seen over the years. This will all be based on my personal experiences trying to solve problems for customers. Take it or leave it.

Noise is the most common complaint by far. When you take your bike into your LBS (local bike shop) and tell them your brakes are making noise. The mechanic is handcuffed because they know it is common and sometimes impossible to solve without replacing parts which are expensive and often seem unnecessary especially when a bike is almost new. 

If the customer initially fails to ""bed"" discs in correctly it is next to impossible to undo that process. When bedding in a brake pad material transfers from the pads themselves into the rotor surface, once enough material has transferred to the rotor that's when your brake begins to get that strong powerful feeling that we love about discs. If the bedding is done incorrectly the pad material is spread unevenly on the rotor and the uneven grabbing causes vibration then loud noise. Game over.

 The pads can be sanded the rotor can be cleaned with all manner of tricks. The most common being brake cleaner on the rotor and sand paper on the pads then attempt to re-bed them in. The problem with that is very often the noise will come back because the deposits on the rotors aren't going to be removed with brake cleaner. You could try to mill or sand rotors but it is next to impossible to get the desired level of finish required to get good power.
 
With that said, some disc strategies. The easiest is when you get your new bikes/brakes. Take a little time and do some light to medium constant braking to get those rotors/pads bedded in nicely before you bomb a hill or go for a MTB ride. If your brake starts making ANY noise during this process either squeeze harder or softer so the noise stops immediately. Whatever you do, DO not hold the brake with the exact amount of pressure to cause the noise. If you do that long enough you bed in the vibration and the brakes make noise.

Ok, so what happens when all goes well and the brake beds in nicely then makes noises in the long run? You clean your rotors with brake cleaner then evaporate both the brake cleaner and other possible containments with a small torch. Take your pads out and put sandpaper on a flat surface then rub the pads across it and get rid of that shiny black glaze you got after you rode your brakes for 5 mins solid whilst descending you local trails. Once the pad surface looks fresh and the rotor is dry go bed them in again. Hopefully all is well and your ready to rock.

Last tip, ride better. I know, I know. It's a bit condescending for a mechanic to tell you that you use your brakes wrong but I do it out of love. The ""Glaze"" on your pads is from heat causing the pad material to ""melt"" for lack of the proper terminology. Then heat continously builds when the brake doesn't get a chance to cool. In other words MTB discs cool very quickly if you let off your brake completely. Most people have a tendency to hold them slightly on all of the time. From a technical standpoint this will cause fade and your brake just build heat until they kinda fail. From a riding standpoint, even ""feathering"" your brakes reduces your cornering traction and your straight line stability. So brake in sections, completely let go as much as you can. Fight the urge to brake and you riding improves as well as your bikes brakes will work when you need them.

If all else fails. It's new rotor and pad time. Very expensive but for your sanity and mine it's sometimes the only way. If you take a look at both Avid and Shimano brakes. Year over year no matter if nothing else in a particular brake has changed the rotors typically have been redesigned. 

With pads you typical have two choices. Organic/Resin or Metallic. To simplify, Organic/Resin pads tend to grab better and run quieter but they also wear out quickly. The metallic pads last longer and still brake well at the sacrifice of peak grab and sometimes a bit of noise.

Well that all I have for now. I have to go to work and actually solve this issue for someone today. Haha.",,False,,t5_2qo3d,False,,,True,t3_1imw07,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1imw07/brake_tips_for_discs/,

Having said that, I recently spent my entire summer pretty much confined to a computer screen with a shattered wrist and the inability to do even the most basic of functions (i.e., typing, lifting, etc.). From first hand experience, I wanted to say that you should all be careful. If you're not sure about a jump or a trail, find someone who knows the trail and check their speed on it instead of gunning it yourself. If you're debating on going on a massive jump that you haven't attempted before, maybe consider finding someone who knows the speed of it before launching yourself off of it. 

A serious injury can fuck you up for a good long while, and a lot of you have jobs. Can you afford the time off? Do you have enough sick-leave built up to take 8 weeks off if you fracture a bone and wind up with a cast that impedes your daily function? 

Have the time of your life and don't let your worries and doubts impede your leisure and recreation. But use good judgement and don't be stupid. Being wreckless on trails is a needless danger to not only yourself, but to the people around you who share the trails.

WARNING: drunken rambling, bear with me....

we are riding bicycles, not curing disease or solving world hunger. if you ride a $10,000 bike or a $200 bike, the only thing that actually matters is that you are riding a bicycle. if you ride a bicycle, you are automatically in the club, riding a bicycle is the only requirement. what you ride is insignificant. 

no one cares what you ride.   i say this for two groups of people.  

group 1 - you are not going to impress me with your bicycle. i don't care how tricked out your bike is, how light it is, or how expensive it is, if you can't ride it on anything more technical than a rocky dirt road, i don't care.  your bike doesn't impress me, how you ride it impresses me.  perhaps i'm jaded because of the people i ride and hang out with, who don't have anything to prove because riding bikes is what they do, it's their job.   you might ""race"" pro, but do you place pro? no? then stop acting all bad ass, you aren't.  stop with the attitude.  

group 2 - i don't care if you are on a crappy hardtail bike.  don't be intimidated by those who ""look the part"","" with the smith glasses, POC gear, and full suspension bikes.  i don't care that you are a beginner, or that you suck, or that you can't make it up that rock ledge or off that drop.  if you are out there riding your bike, that is awesome and all that matters.  again, it's not what you are riding that matters, it's how you ride it.   are you having fun?  that is the only thing that counts.  so you are on a trek 820?  no one cares. you are out riding it? that's all that matters.   

a guy on a trek 820 with toe clips who rides his bike all the time on everything with gusto and heart and soul, as best as he can, is more of a mountain biker than a guy with a linskey with XTR walking around with full kit who talks more than he rides. 

by all means post your new bikes, i intend on posting mine.  that's not what i'm talking about.  

there is a time and place to be serious about cycling.  i would say 98% of the time is NOT the time.   

i'm being a bit of a retro grouch here i guess.  i sort of miss the ""old days"" when mountain biking was about travel, riding, fun, fucking around, and a ""brotherhood"" of sorts, and not competition, what you look like or what you ride or what you are wearing.  

racing is racing, i'm not talking about that. 

a cool bike is a cool bike, i'm not talking about that. 

soul.  it's about soul.  

have fun, i wish you ALL many happy miles.

It happened in the Partridge Hill/Durrance lake trail area. 

Be extremely careful when riding, as more hazards could be present.

Im guessing they have been posted before but they are always worth a watch. 

To give an example I was usually near the end of my category (Sport DH) of about 30 riders and couldn't quite understand why I felt as fast as the other guys in most sections but my overall time was way off. Watching the cornering video made me realise my technique was totally wrong and I now corner and carry loads more speed. Looking at my practice times I am fully expecting to be in the top 3 this year. Its crazy how a simple video can help you so much. Anyway, hopefully these will help some of you. I have not watched any of the others, but im sure they will be as good as the cornering one that aided me!

1343707951.0,113,self.MTB,xfkb5,Don't overlook geometry and fit.,imaghoul,127,14,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/xfkb5/dont_overlook_geometry_and_fit/,"I've noticed that most of the advice on this sub is to ""get the Trek because I like Trek more than Specialized"" or ""that one because it has XT brakes and the other is 2x10"" when someone is asking between different sized and shaped bikes. All those components can be changed, but if your bike doesn't fit or you're getting a slack, long travel bike to pedal down a fire road, you're gonna have a bad time. The majority of out of the box bikes are going to have safe, agreeable geometry to suit the average rider. However, you should still understand what those numbers mean and how it's going to affect how the bike will ride, where you plan to ride it.

These are the numbers I think are most important when choosing a frame:

**Head angle**: The larger the number the quicker the steering and vice verse. XC bikes will normally have a head angle of 68 or 72* because it turns faster and climbs more easily. AM and DH bikes will range from 68* to 61* because it will be much more stable at high speed.

Further detail from dandelusional: 
 A slacker head angle not only increases stability at speed on the bike, but also promotes better performance from the fork due to the closer relation in angle between the fork and the ground. It also decreases your chance of going over the bars on steep terrain as the front wheel has a much lesser chance of tucking under when it's pushed further out in front of the bike.
Downsides other than those noted above would also include a tendency for the front wheel to wander on climbs (can be overcome somewhat with a steeper seat angle to keep the weight forwards).
Just to further separate this out, roughly speaking: XC race bikes will normally be running in the 71-69 range; XC/trail bikes will be in the 70-68 range; AM bikes in the 68-65 range; and DH bikes in the 65-61.
This is all in regard to 26"" wheels. Bigger wheels normally run steeper head angle (bigger number) relative to their 26"" counterparts due to the larger wheels greater ability to roll over terrain, and slower steering.

**Wheelbase**: Larger means more stable, but less maneuverable, especially when you're going slow. 

**BB height**: Lower means better handling since your center of gravity is closer to the ground, but it may put you at higher risk of bashing your chain ring, bb shell and more pedal strikes.

**Effective top tube length**: Make sure this is the number you're looking at, not the top tube length. This is more about fit than anything else and I think it should be the focus of the fit, not the seat tube length.

**Standover height**: Lower is almost always better because it will be more out of the way. Remember that you need to be dynamic and move around when riding.

**Chainstay length**: Shorter chainstays will make it easier to get the front end up, control the bike in the air and maneuver as well as be stiffer. The bike will have much snappier handling. However, too short and the front end may pop up too easy. Long chainstays will get better grip on the front tire. There is a lot of personal preference and riding style involved with chainstays. I tend to like mine on the short side if you hadn't noticed.

After: [Post PastiDip](http://www.pinkbike.com/photo/9866659/)

For those that are wondering what PlastiDip is, its a spray on rubberized coating that has been popular among auto enthusiasts looking to change the color of their entire car, wheels, etc. without breaking the bank. It is supposedly pretty durable, and can be removed whenever by peeling it off. It comes in a variety of colors as well.

Since I just painted it yesterday, I can't vouch for its durability, but only time will tell.

I got it in aerosol can form at the Home Depot, for 6 bucks a can. It took me two whole cans for the bike ($6 each), and I did about 4 coats. 12 bucks to change the color of your bike, not bad at all! The only prep i did was disassembling the frame so that each piece could be painted individually, and cleaning the frame beforehand with simple green and giving it a good wipe before I started painting.

I have been asked to spread the word so if you feel you would like to help there has been a fund setup to help the family.  I have no affiliation with this fundraiser so take it for what it is.

Was finally able to really ride over the weekend.,jfactor1,103,6,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1ebtab/had_a_serious_crash_last_fall_was_finally_able_to/,"So last fall I had a pretty serious [crash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMkVe1oyljI).  I broke 8 ribs, my left clavicle and popped a small hole in each of my lungs and got to ride in an ambulance.


Although I was seriously injured I couldn't wait to get back on my bike.  But I knew I'd be better prepared this time.  Bought a new [bike]( http://i.imgur.com/TY0ciQj.jpg) which I've been mainly riding XC on since there aren't any real hills near me.  I also bought some [body armor](     http://www.motorcycle-superstore.com/2/6/10/45258/ITEM/SixSixOne-Vapor-Pressure-Suit.aspx), which I had been meaning to do all last season (too little, too late, right?). 


On Sunday I was finally able to head up the same trails where I had my crash last fall.  I was really excited to be riding DH again!!!  


Once we arrived I got scared.  I rode the trails, but WAY more slowly than I used to.  I knew I was being overly cautious, but had a hard time bringing myself to relax. 

As the day went on I did get more comfortable and started riding some of the features instead of bypassing them.  Finally hit the [rock garden]( http://i.imgur.com/uTE0XDs.jpg) at speed, got some [air](http://i.imgur.com/KADuHdr.jpg) on another trail.  


Right before we left I finally got up the courage to hit the jump that took me out last November.  Although I didn't get nearly as much air as I normally would have, it was [good](http://i.imgur.com/LqcLhP9.jpg).


I've got a long ways to go before I'm back to riding at 100%, but it was a good start.

Yesterday's ride should have been a fairly straightforward loop up and around Mount Wilson but a series of unfortunate wheel/tire mechanicals and equipment failures rendered my friend’s bike un-rideable and we were still a good 10 miles from civilization. Despite futile attempts to repair the bike, we were now faced with the prospect of having to hike out on foot, in cycling shoes and wheeling our bikes through some of the San Gabriel’s most rugged with limited water supplies and electrolytes. What would have been quite a fun and rapid descent on the mountain bikes became much more of a challenge on foot - especially in terms of time. After some slow progress, we managed to find some mobile phone coverage, and, feeling a little run-down and under pressure after 8 hours out there, and knowing there was several more hours ahead, we decided to err on the side of caution and call the emergency services with our GPS coordinates and our planned route off the mountain. The plan being that we would confirm with them once we had exfiltrated the mountain safely. 

To cut a long story short, in a cruel twist, the phone call got cut off before this information or our GPS coordinates could be fully relayed to them. To make matters worse, we were unable to regain network signal even after traveling for several more miles in the general direction of suburbia. The only useful information we had time to pass on was our names, the name of the trail and that we were approximately above the city of Monrovia. Within the hour, the LA County Sheriff's Air Rescue 5 helicopter located us on it’s first pass up the mountain, literally flying in right overhead. I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt it was us they were looking for. An LA County Sheriff paramedic [rappelled down through the canopy](http://i.imgur.com/QKdo4.jpg) onto the trail. After relaying our current situation to him, he decided we'd been out there long enough and made the call to airlift us off the mountain...as it turns out, he was in much better position to assess the situation than we were. We were very dehydrated and quite sun-burned.  Ironically he is also a mountain bike rider and racer and understood our predicament and the series of unfortunate calamities we’d experienced. And so after a short hike to some open space, [Air Rescue 5](http://i.imgur.com/ecMic.jpg) performed a precision one-wheel landing right on top of us as we crouched in the brush on the verge of a tiny ridge, covering our faces from debris kicked up by the rotor wash. 

A [short chopper ride](http://i.imgur.com/ut2z8.jpg) to the nearby helipad at Chantry Flats and a car ride back to Sierra Madre Search and Rescue station followed. Although no one was hurt, in all, we spent 10 hours from 6.20 am in the sun throughout the heat of the day, covering 30 miles and ascending [over 8000 vertical feet](http://i.imgur.com/CuK1q.jpg). Rather dehydrated, leg cramps, and a little exposed but ‘ok’. Two bottles of water in the helicopter, a big bottle of Gatorade at Sierra Madre Search and Rescue Station and three 24 oz bottles of cytomax within two hours of getting home and it dawned on me just how depleted I was. I'm very grateful to the LA County Sheriffs department for finding us and helping us out of a tight spot (literally) with such precision. Also the volunteers at the Sierra Madre Search and Rescue Station for their hospitality. As much as I'd like to think that we would have made it out of there just fine (albeit several agonizing hours later), I'm glad they showed up when they did. [They are all true professionals.](http://i.imgur.com/tkAOs.jpg)
 
The mountains are a spectacular place to explore and experience and I’m blessed to have the San Gabriel’s literally on my doorstep. But you also need to have a healthy respect for those hills; No matter how many times you’ve ridden up them, how small they become to you, or how familiar you are with them, you can still find yourself in a tough spot and there's no substitute for preparedness.

Oh... and there is no bill for the helo ride :)

Edit: Many readers seem to be skipping over the part where I **DID NOT** request a rescue - but rather was giving an FYI that we were out in the hills and that if they if nobody hears from us in a few hours that THEN they should come looking for us. The call dropped - we could not get reception - they came looking anyway.",,False,,t5_2qo3d,1343957973.0,,,True,t3_xl8gx,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/xl8gx/mtb_helicopter_evac/,

It was one of those moments that I couldn't do anything. I needed both hands to stabilise myself so I couldn't get rid of the damn thing. Also I had someone just behind me so that could have been dangerous.

Hi Reddit,

 I started my business career in Vancouver, Canada as a young guy selling 10 speed bikes in West Point Cycles in 1972. Then I bought it. In 1981 I founded Rocky Mountain Bicycles and in '91 Race Face which I owned and managed until I sold it in 1997. During and after this time I've been involved with starting around 20 companies...but many of them were failures. And I'm fine with that. Our most recent project is JusTea - a Canadian-Kenyan partnership to produce a hand-crafted whole-leaf tea on the one-acre farms owned by farmers living below the world poverty line. So what is on your mind? Ask me almost anything about: business, bikes, or JusTea!

This was what happened to my beloved Frankenbike. http://imgur.com/a/9pRlW

She's cobbled together with the pieces of three bikes before her. The bar-ends are easily 15 years old. She's helped me lose weight, get from A to B, and generally gets me outside to learn about where I live and meet my neighbors. 

She was my good, dear friend. I knew her moods and her temperament, and she knew mine. She loved me enough to let this happen while I was still only a few blocks from home, and wasn't off somewhere inaccessible.I think of it as her taking care of me like always, making sure I was OK.  I confess that I cried as I was walking home. 

If any of you redditors can help me understand how this could even happen, I'd appreciate it. I confess I'm fairly heavy, and I am a ""masher"" on my pedals/gears. Did I eventually just stress this joint into submission? 

I am so sad. This is a piece of my life that is now gone. And I have nothing else to turn to (bike-wise). As you can probably tell, I don't ride a lot of trails. I live in LA, and I ride the streets to stay in shape and get around. Any advice on a similar frame to replace her is appreciated. I'm not going to become a roadie or a fixie. I like the ruggedness of a solid hardtail and the strength of this light, stiff frame. Leave a comment if you have a hardtail you love, that a recovering fat guy could take a look at when I come up for air.

The first 3 miles are through a town, neighborhood, park and side walk of the most used rode. Normal ride, everything seemed great. I just cleaned my bike and it was shining. Felt really good with my new back pack. Overall, a positive feeling. On the 11th mile, 4 miles from home, we stopped on the trail to overlook a 30ft cliff into water. The path is made of dirt/tiny gravel. While standing next a cliff, saoking in the landscape leaning agaisnt a tree, I take my shoe off to pour out the collected gravel and i rebalnce myself but dropped the shoe. **INTO THE WATER**. Ended up riding home with 1 shoe. Countless stares and questions like, ""Wheres 'yo shoe!"" *pointing at me*. Did I mention to get on/off the trail you have to hike and carry your bike? 

TL;DR : 4 miles 1 shoe

It was very exciting and I think deliberate is an appropriate word; very different then just riding a paved trail. I wasn't able to go very fast on some parts but it was very adrenaline pumping in a way I've never felt haha!  

I do have to say, I like the actual being in the nature more than I do the crazy jumps you have to make, I'm a bit of a chicken when it comes to that ha. But some of the turns and stuff, had I taken a spill I could have been seriously injured. There were sections that were very thin and sharply curved that were steeply uphill, and if anyone were to fall they're break some bones for sure.  

I saw some deer too, which was pretty sweet.  

I'm really looking forward to getting better and eventually going faster like some of the pros that were out there. I still can't believe how fast some of the guys were going, they were really on their game.

I also have to say that it felt good, everyone was nice and it felt like I was a part of something for a change.",,False,,t5_2qo3d,False,,,True,t3_1i0c8u,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1i0c8u/first_time_mountain_biking/,

So much work has gone into getting this machine, thousands of dollars, and many of us have put in a lot of man hours this get this scene going in our backyard. Please spread the word and keep your eyes peeled. This happened in Portland Oregon by the way.

EDIT: KGW was out at Stub, here's their [report](http://www.kgw.com/home/Trail-construction-machine-worth-80K-stolen-134790348.html) Thanks to everyone who continues to spread word of the stolen ST240. 

Best EDIT Ever: Exciting news, the ST240 was recovered today out in the forest. The Oregon State Police received an anonymous tip that lead them to the ST240 and they have one person in custody and will continue the investigation.

Ride down was on a fun dirt road that started with some good baseball sized rocks and turned to regular dirt road with some loose gravel.

1365725899.0,67,self.MTB,1c68fj,"Race bike stolen from the Via Rail station in Stratford, Ontario. Via is not responding to the police requests to see surveillance tapes, and now it's too late to catch who caught my bike, or to find it in one piece. I am devastated and depressed at the loss of my bike and my race season. :(",chopstix007,84,17,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1c68fj/race_bike_stolen_from_the_via_rail_station_in/,"DAY OF THEFT (April 9):
My race bike was stolen from the building where I work... our offices are above Via Rail, but in their building. I parked it where I usually do- in a private lobby that's out of public bounds, and headed upstairs. When the day finished and I bounded downstairs, I stopped short when I noticed my bike was gone, and immediately alternated between hyperventilating, crying, and panicking. What the hell do I do?? Who do I contact?? Where's my baby?? This bike is (was) my baby, my training partner... it even had a name! (White Lightning.) It was my prized possession and the one thing I would take with me to the grave. It was also an original- it was ridden in a World Championship race by someone on the Specialized team in the early 2000s. It was still marked 'for race only', and was lighter than air because of the super awesome team-only carbon-mixture frame. It was completely silent racing down a hill, and was a rocket through the trails. I knew it, it knew me, and we rode as one. And then... it was just GONE.

Since the bike was worth $5000 in parts alone, I reported this to the police that night, and then drove around my town for three hours just looking for it. I stopped in to the Via station close to closing time, thinking there may be a chance someone could access the security cameras I saw. No go- the only ones there were workers on the Goderich-Exeter Railway line. I was given a name of who to speak to the next morning when Via staff came in. 

DAY 2 (April 10):
Met with the Officer doing the report, and he and I went to see the tapes. It ended up being the Via guys' day off, so the woman in charge of the station in that situation tried accessing them. She was unable to- apparently only higher-up Via employees had access. She called the guy that usually works there, but he was unreachable. The cop called Via head office to try and get someone out to show the tape, but was informed that it wasn't that easy... they'd have to verify his identity as a cop, go through paperwork, put in requests, and then personally send someone from head office (I'm assuming all the way in Toronto or Montreal) to show him the footage when there was time. The cop stressed the urgency of seeing the tapes and Via didn't budge. They also didn't return calls or schedule anything as they said they would. Procedures could take weeks. 

He called another Via line and had someone local come in that, though not from head office, may have a slim chance of getting into the video area. After meeting with that person, he was informed that the video surveillance wasn't under the control of Via, but a management company that ran the building, and that Via has nothing to do with it. (These surveillance cameras were only installed two months prior.) This management company, coincidentally, was hired by Via Rail.

DAY 3 (April 11):
The Constable on the case called Via all morning, and was put on hold or rerouted for the majority of them. When he finally got through, he was told by the guy in charge that he was in a meeting and that he would call back in fifteen minutes. The Constable didn't get a call, so he called at fifteen minutes, then twenty, then thirty, and continued to do so all afternoon... essentially spamming Via with voicemails to call back (and yes, keeping track of calls and making records). He received no calls back for the second day in a row.

NOW:
We have yet to see the cameras, and Via Rail has yet to call back to resolve this issue. Now I'm not only mad that my bike was stolen, but that Via is crushing any chance of a recovery by stalling the procedure. This is above and beyond being a jerk of a company. This is withholding evidence or purposely standing in the way of the cops investigation, both which could have lead to a criminal apprehension if the tape had been viewed in time. 

TL;DR: Specialized race bike, valued at over $5000, was stolen from the Via Rail station. The cops on the case are urgently requesting to see video footage that shows the theft, and Via isn't cooperating. This delay has cost me any hope of getting my bike back in one piece. I'm devastated at the theft of my baby, the loss of my race season, and the fact that I won't be able to ride anymore since I can't afford another bike of that calibre. I'm disappointed in humanity for being capable of such despicable acts, and in corporations that just don't care.

We are finally beginning to emerge from our wintry cocoon.  But it's slow going.  It's too warm for snow, but too cold for anything to dry out.  This means EXTREMELY damp trails at all times of the day that will not dry out.

So, major asshole thinks to himself, ""sure is nice out, finally getting out of the 30's!  Gonna go ride!""  That's great.  We all think that.  But major asshole rides the trails.  When somebody tells major asshole that he shouldn't ride in the mud, he responds by saying, ""are you afraid of riding in the mud?""

No, you fucking dickcheese, it's because I didn't fucking build that trail, and neither did you.  You're ruining it for everybody else.

So in case you haven't realized, my favorite local trail is currently rutted to hell.  And when it DOES dry out, it's going to be a horrible bumpy nightmare, because of these dicks.

If ANY OF YOU DO THIS, please, please keep tabs on what your local trail association is doing.  They usually have a facebook page or a twitter account and WILL UPDATE YOU ON TRAIL CONDITIONS.

IF THEY SAY IT'S WET AND YOU SHOULDN'T RIDE, GO FUCK YOURSELF AND DON'T RIDE.

Good or bad?",IHaveBeenSoFarAsTo,81,19,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1dfpn3/ive_been_thinking_for_a_while_that_showing/,"Grab a seat, friends, this is a long one.

One of the most frequent things I hear from non-riders that I try to convince to ride with us is that they're scared. Looking at things like Rampage, and pretty much every mountain biking video ever, I can sort of understand it. I've been working on making some nice XC videos, in an attempt to say ""hey look everyone, we don't all [ride like this](http://vimeo.com/58866685)"".

So far, I've put together [Paradise](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw7t6AZ55ho) (complete with local music!), and one you may have already seen called [Shock Treatment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2USaZ4KsNI). If anyone has suggestions for what would make them better, I'm happy to listen!

The main point of this post, though, was to start a discussion with you lovely people. I agree that there are other barriers to entry that keep people out of mountain biking (i.e. the price of gear, access to trails, bugs, dirt, etc), but I'm of the mind that the huge drops and jumps we usually show people are a pretty large contributing factor. Should we as a community be working to mitigate the sort of terrifying, death-defying aura that seems to cover the entirety of mountain biking, and point out that there are other ways to ride that are equally fun and exciting?

I've heard of people getting flak from local riders for ""exposing"" the lesser-known trails to a more general audience, and I've definitely been out on days that were uncomfortably busy, so I am envisioning some arguments about how making the sport look more accessible will lead to *too many* people on the trails. I agree that packed trails are bad, but you could argue that a bigger community will have more power to lobby for new trail systems to be built/maintained/opened, right?


**TL;DR:** Should we be trying to break the perception of mountain biking as just an extreme sport, and make CX/XC/AM/etc more widely known and more easily accessible? What's the best way to do that? Is there anything I'm not considering?

Rode it a few times, absolutely LOVE this whip.  It's super stiff and stable on DH, laughs at everything I throw at it, flies through the air at the greatest of ease, and rides trails and climbs like a champ too.  

The Soda FR frame has adjustable rear travel via a changeable pin placement on the rear shock.  Last night I was adjusting mine from the 6"" back to the 7"" position and noticed a small but definite amount of ""play"" in the suspension.  Took the bolt out and looked carefully, the bolt was able to move ever so slightly in the shock mounting hardware.  I added some grease to pack it in, but it's still moving a little bit.  

Out of concern I shot NS a message through their website last night.  They responded today, less than 24 hours from my sending the message, with this:  
&gt;Thanks for writing. This is a small manufacturing issue with shock mount hardware in some Soda frames. Please provide your shipping address, we will send you a new set of bolts that will fix the problem free of charge.

Was out cycling today, was only planning on a short cycle however I ended up over the other side of town. When all of a sudden I managed to misjudge a ledge and gave myself a pinch flat. Now because I wasn't planning on going far I had no repair kit. 

A guy on a very nice LaPierre kindly stopped and offered me a patch, so I got the first patch done which was self adhesive, the second patch though, old skool so we needed glue. He had ran out of glue, thought bugger! He offered his spare tube but i thanked him and refused, I couldn't take his only spare tube. But not to worry, I was prepared for the walk anyway. I thanked him and he was on his way. I carried on walking. 10 minutes later and a guy on a road type bike stopped and offered help, was great, got the second hole patched and managed to cycle home. 

I just think its great knowing that even as complete strangers we can still pull together and help each other out. 

So I guess I just want to say thanks, thanks for being part of my favourite hobby, thanks for being such great people and thanks for the patches!

And I even had every water bottle I owned on me, and had been drinking tons of water prior! 

Of course, if you can avoid riding in the heat in the first place, do so. 

Happy trails!

After months of commuting with my older Specialized Cruiser, I decided to save my pennies for a more versatile and adventurous bike. The new bike didn't last me 4 full days!

I parked my bike outside of Hotel le Germaine on 9th Avenue at 7:50am. Locked both wheels and frame to the bike pole. Returned to the location of my bike ready for lunch Yoga at 11:50am to discover my beloved bike was missing. Spoke with the security at the building and was told no cameras pointed in that direction.

There is a bottle holder on the frame and a black bell on the left handle.

Discovered an older blue, [Diamondback Outlook](http://i.imgur.com/Wm0ovvF.jpg) bike parked next to where mine was left, it was not locked and still currently remains there; May have been left there by the thief.

I have filed a report with the police and I have also filed a report with Bike Calgary (www.bikecalgary.org), as well as spending every moment on Kijiji, Pinkbike, and Ebay.

I am absolutely devastated and heart broken and while I know it is not likely I will find [my Kona](http://i.imgur.com/6gW7A0n.jpg), I would love any recommendations or any little bit of help possible!!",,False,,t5_2qo3d,False,,,True,t3_1g9wob,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1g9wob/i_am_heartbroken_brand_new_kona_mountain_bike/,

Here's my edit.  Apologies for the spectacularly shitty transitions and overall choppiness.  It ain't bad though.  Had to work with the footage I had.  No music, just natural sounds (with Ray's Guitar Hero-esque soundtrack in the background). Watch in HD.

Ray's MTB park in Cleveland, Ohio, for those of you who may not know, is an indoor bike park of almost incomparable quality.  To know a place like this exists...in CLEVELAND of all places, is mind blowing.

This was my first time there and I felt like a fat kid in a Swiss chocolate shop (I've been to Switzerland - those fuckers know chocolate).  At first I was a little gun shy on some of the obstacles, particularly the things including jumps.  But one reason Ray's is so good is because of how wonderfully the place is designed to go from complete beginner to slopestyle expert difficulty with everything in between.  Spend enough time in that park, with no prior experience, and I am confident you could tackle just about everything there.

As proof of this, I saw riders young and old.  A little girl with her dad, no more than 11 years old (doing lots of obstacles that would make grown men back down in fear) shredding alongside some 40+ year old dude with a hobbled together (though rather sick looking) dirt jump bike of unknown origin.  And of course, lots of kids who are just incredible and doing all the shit we watch weekly in Red Bull vids, right next to you, showing you up close how it's done. 

The place is fucking magical.

Oh and one more thing, if you have a kid, take them there.  You'd think a place like Ray's would scare a lot of parents away.  Apparently not.  The majority of participants were around age 12-15, I'd wager.  Makes me feel pretty good about the future of mountain biking.

* We're growing at an average rate of 15 users a day.

Thank you everyone for helping this community grow so much!

A couple quick things to keep in mind:

* [](/flag) Team Icons: if you want your team, state, or country icon to appear next to your name in r/mtb, post in this thread and I'll add it. (Make sure you reply directly to me, or else I won't get oranged and won't notice your request.)
* Please follow proper reddiquette.
* Remember to vote based on quality, not opinion, and keep your submission titles factual and opinion-free.
* Do not downvote opinions just because you disagree with them, or mass-downvote someone else's posts. (It's obvious and tacky.)
* On the other hand, be generous with upvotes. (They are free, after all.) 
* Avoid submitting images that are just text (this includes rage comics and meme pics); you can submit a self post with the same message and avoid having people hate you.

Keep riding!

Robby

**Edit**: If I don't get your icon up in a day or so, send me a PM. Sometimes messages get lost in the flood. 

**Edit II**: UPVOTE! No, not me; posts you think contribute to Reddit in a positive way. If I see another post with no upvotes and three replies in agreement, I'm going to puke.

I'm kind of all alone in that regard.  And after a particularly nasty crash on a very loose steep as hell right hander, I can't ride for about 6 weeks.

I go out on a ride every single day.  Most days I go up to the mountain and get in 5 or 6 runs on the longest trail up there and really push myself hard to absolutely pin it down and get in every pedal stroke I can.  Sometimes I just go ride the most uneven sidewalks I can find and just goof around on them.

And after I found out the damage I was really bummed.  When I explained it to people I'd say ""I hurt my left arm, and I can't ride my bike.""  They'd go ""oh, so what?""  Then I'd try to explain it to them further.  To explain how I ride, why I ride.  To explain the absolute joy and sense of accomplishment I feel when I fly down a trail.  They still don't get it.

So I started wondering...  For all of you, for your reasons, for how you ride, if you had to pick one video segment to show someone how and why you ride, what would you pick?  I don't care if you do XC, AM, Enduro, Trials, DH, DJ, WHATEVER....  What would you show someone to try to get them to understand what you do?

I went through a lot of my favorite clips and was reminded today of this one:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S5cMZxs2H4

That's how I like to ride.  Just popping around everywhere loose as hell and having fun but still flying by the seat of my pants.  Not being able to ride is a very soul crushing moment for me right now.

1353871566.0,58,self.MTB,13rr0l,I make open source MTB trail maps. Got questions about making your own? Ask here!,c0nsumer,66,8,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/13rr0l/i_make_open_source_mtb_trail_maps_got_questions/,"I make MTB trail maps for our local MTB organization, [CRAMBA](http://cramba.org). Most of these are official park maps that the land mangers use as the official maps, but a couple are unofficial, designed solely to add detail to existing knowledge.

I've seen a number of questions about making maps come up here on Reddit, so I figured I'd start a thread to help others out as I can. Got questions? Please ask!

To start, the workflow that I use is documented [here](https://nuxx.net/blog/2012/06/05/mtb-trail-mapping-workflow-with-openstreetmaps/). It's all based on [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org), so the resulting maps are all Creative Commons (CC BY-SA 2.0) licensed. Thus, these are open source maps. Also, by putting the map data into OSM first then other online maps can benefit from the enhanced data set, people can view the trail routes using viewers such as [OsmAnd](http://osmand.net/) on their phones.

Here's examples of some of the maps that I've done. They are all generally in the same style so they can be CRAMBA's maps, but each has some local concessions:

* [River Bends Park](http://mmba.org/library/maps/riverbends/latest.pdf)
* [Stony Creek Metropark](http://mmba.org/library/maps/stonycreek/latest.pdf)
* [Addison Oaks County Park](http://mmba.org/library/maps/addisonoaks/latest.pdf)
* [Clinton River Park Trails](http://mmba.org/library/maps/clintonriverparktrail/latest.pdf)

To start, some big pointers that I can give are as follows:

* Remember that your map will mostly be used by those who do not know the trail. Think about every aspect of the map from the perspective of a new user first.
* Don't use a satellite photo for your map background if you can help it. This makes it hard to print and often hard to read.
* Test reading your map on-screen using color blindness simulation software such as [Color Oracle](http://colororacle.org/).
* Be sure your map prints properly and is easily readable in both B&amp;W and color, using both laser and inkjet printers.
* Don't add detail just to add detail. Too much detail muddies the map and makes it too complicated. Figuring out what not to include is a huge part of map drawing.
* Your map must reflect the reality of the trail. Don't add things which you aren't sure of, since the map will lead people to look for them. There is little more frustrating then spending time trying to find a missing intersection marker, a trail that isn't really there, etc.",,False,,t5_2qo3d,False,,usmi,True,t3_13rr0l,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/13rr0l/i_make_open_source_mtb_trail_maps_got_questions/,

If this gets a good response, I'll try to make it happen. 

All this information can be found in various places online, but I'll give a brief background. Joe was born in 1953 and grew up in Mill Valley, California. He entered the mountain biking scene close to its beginning, participated in early Repack races in nearby Fairfax (Today is the 35th anniversary of the first one) and rode the area on and around Mt. Tamalpias with his friends. In 1977, he built built Breezer #1, the bike generally accepted to be the first purpose-built mountain bike. 9 more similar bikes soon followed. Joe was also a Cat 1 road racer during this period.

Joe continued making bikes under the brand name Breezer throughout the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s. Breezer grew into a larger-scale company during this period, with Joe designing each model and heading the company. In late 2008, Breezer was acquired by Advanced Sports International, and Joe stayed on as designer. The sale allowed Breezer to start making mountain bikes again, for the first time since 2000.

1372538502.0,55,self.MTB,1hbtsh,I had my first proper crash today,refomokm,69,14,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1hbtsh/i_had_my_first_proper_crash_today/,"And I actually felt great about it. I was at the downhill woods I ride most days for the third consecutive day after getting home. I'd had a really good session, having hit a couple of features I've been working up the courage to hit for ages (riding downhill on a hardtail means drops become much scarier) and I managed to drop my time from 18 to 15 seconds over one short section whilst trying to unlearn my habit of being too eager to brake into corners by timing myself. 

At the top of the woods on the last run of the day I remember thinking, ""I haven't fallen off in the last three days. I'm obviously not pushing hard enough."" Usually I have a small spill most times: nothing major, just slow speed stuff, usually from being too cautious - never over the bars. I decided I'd try and push myself a bit on this last run, so I hit the slope into the first corner and pushed through the berm without braking; much bigger than usual off the first jump, fast into the second corner over two roots - no berm here so you have to scrub a lot of speed (I'm yet to find a really quick way to do it). Into the short flat bit past a tree into a very steep bank (too steep to walk); for the first time ever I didn't brake at the top, so rolled into it very fast. That spits you out onto a little shallow bump which I normally pump, so I float over the top, push the bike down - oh shit I'm already airborne because of all that extra speed.

The bike hit the ground nose first, my feet pinged off the pedals, I grabbed the brakes, and rather than executing a gentle left turn across the large flat section to the next stretch of trail, I found myself careering at high speed, wheels locked, into a pretty substantial thicket of trees. Next thing I know, I'm several metres past the trees, having bounced off at least one on the way through, lying on my back beside the bike, feeling a little bruised but mostly fine.

I've been riding downhill for a few months now and finally having a big(-ish) crash proves several things: that buying a full-face and big pads was worth it (the helmet got a nice scratch on the side), that I am pushing my limits, and, oddly enough, that the risks are completely manageable: I fell off because I made a mistake because I was pushing my limits too hard, not because of some freak accident that I had no control over.

Turns out I'd buckled both my wheels quite significantly, bent the derailleur hanger and shredded a cable - spent several hours in the garage today fixing it all. That's fine, because my second love after riding my bike is working on it. I ended up giving the bike a really thorough service and spending the whole day in there.

Sorry for the wall of text - I figured you guys would appreciate my musings a little more than my non-riding friends!",,False,,t5_2qo3d,False,,,True,t3_1hbtsh,http://www.reddit.com/r/MTB/comments/1hbtsh/i_had_my_first_proper_crash_today/,

Shrader valves, do not always fit thru presta holes on your rim. Yup, that's all I had in my camalbak due to inventory at my LBS at the time. I have a few presta tubes at home that I later stockpiled at a different time, but figured I would run the other one as my spare. 

Got a pinch flat last night, and was schooled on the differences. Was only about 2 miles away, and I didn't want to try to find a way to make it fit, so I decided to pack it up and walk it in. 

Luckily, mountain bikers look out for each other, and a group rolled up and offered assistance. Luckily he rode a 29er and had a spare tube and saved the day. (although I have read that you can stretch a 26 tube on there to get you home in a pinch) 

Didn't even catch his name, but thanks man. I will be sure to pay it forward first chance I get (and continue to do so, thereafter) 

I love this sport, haven't met someone I didn't like yet.
