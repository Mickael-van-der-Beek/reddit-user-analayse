I have been using this .als project to compose,
it's basically chords and scales. It's very useful to those who are in the process of learning some music theory and for those who want to quickly figure out chord progressions for a new track.

I basically teach the chords that I want to use to a pad or a keyboard and trigger them via midi.
Lately I have been composing entire tracks with just a piano sound and once everything sounds good together I replace the piano sound with bass, lead, arp, and so on...

I figured that some of you might find this useful,
take care

Grab it here:

BTW: some stuff MIGHT be wrong, if so please let me know or fix it yourself and reup it for some karma :)

EDIT: I have not included the samples for the grand piano because I figured you would want to use the sound that you are comfortable with

You can interact with the software using keyboard, mouse, touch input, and with a Novation LaunchPad S. It can be used in conjunction with any of your favorite soft-synths or DAW's by using virtual MIDI cables and connecting them to your program of choice. I have personally tried using this with the Native Instruments Komplete Suite and Ableton Live and it has worked well.

Side note: My significant other essentially banned me from buying any additional music production gear/software but I was in love with the Ableton Push so I built this application.

Disclaimer: I've only been able to test on Windows 8/8.1. If it isn't working for you, let me know what your PC configuration is and I'll see if I can fix the bug.

Give it a try: www.peachykeys.com

These tutorials are from a few months ago, they were quite well-received when I first posted them and if the community is interested, I'd like to make more!

I've got about 6 years experience with Ableton, and am a signed producer and experienced digital+vinyl dj with a passion for getting the most out of my gear.

So far I've focused on performance techniques within Live, but I'm perfectly happy to impart my production knowledge in the same format; what would you like to see? If the videos appeal to you and you've got an idea for how I can improve or what I can cover in the future, please let me know!

I don't see this happening on many other threads. If you took the time to view something and downvote it why and the hell would you not give a reason why? 

Just disliking the genre is no reason to downvote a song. Blind hate never got anyone anywhere. What does downvoting someone's song make you feel better about yourself since other people downvoted yours? All this thinking will do is still up negativity and restrict progress.

Most of these were submissions from people just wanting others to critique their song, which most didn't get critiqued at all. If all your going to do is downvote something and not explain why then gtfo off this thread. We don't need the negativity and it brings some decent songs out of the limelight for others to critique. This is how we progress. This is how we better ourselves.

The only method I know of would be to browse to your Factory Pack installation folder, open each one and open the ""Properties.cfg"" file inside the ""Ableton Folder Info"" then compare the ""PackRevision"" value to the name of the .alp file in the link to download that pack on the Ableton site. I'm pretty sure no one has ever done that, it would be incredibly tedious.

I've been working a bit to see if I could write a program that would automatically download updated packs and install them. I've made a bit of headway but it would take a significant amount of effort to take it in its current form to point where it would be useful for the masses. 

So far I'm able to securely log in to Ableton's site, get all the download links for packs that you own, parse the file names, and check the local packs to see which ones need to be updated. So yeah.. I'm already half way there.

The idea would be that any packs which needed updates would be downloaded immediately to a specified folder and then allow the user to do what they wanted with it. 

I would still have to write a GUI for this, and probably include an auto-updater for the program itself since any time Ableton changes their site it could potentially break my code. I already have an autoupdater written for previous projects, I just have to integrate it and get stuff up online.

The language I'm working in is PC only, but at its core most of what is done uses cURL, which is cross-platform. I would gladly make the source code available once finished so someone else could come up with a Mac equivalent.

So yeah? Who is interested? Would anyone be willing to donate to help me justify finishing such a project? It probably wouldn't take much, I've only spent a couple hours so far and completed most of the complicated parts (Ableton.com uses CSRF protection which made the remote account log-in a nightmare).

I was recently looking for courses at university as I haven't fully decided what course i'd like to take yet, but was pretty shocked when I realised that there was at least 5 music production courses. I think it's great that they're offering new, more exciting degrees but also feel like the industry is getting saturated like hell and in turn is making it all to do with your publicity and not your talent.

About the pack: I recorded a heavily augmented chain of Live 9's 606 kit from an a large nearly empty room next to my studio. A pair of Rode NT-5 condenser mics spaced far apart provided a weird binaural recording which I sidechained the main kit. 

This allows for the initial attack of the drum to be mono, but the tail is  stereo. 

Samples are not filtered. 

Hold down the key/drumpad/midi controller to listen to the long reverb tail of each sample. 

An ADSR macro is set up to control all drums.

These waveforms are mostly uncompressed

Used a special downsampling device to provide a bit of clipping. Easy to filter out if you like or good for a 16bit MPC crunchy type of sound.

I did struggle for a while to get a good sound out of abletons stoc plugs.  But I will say this.. understanding EQ, compression (and when not to use) panning, reverb handling and listening skills will take you from ok to really good sounding the quickest.  Exotic effects and processors just helps you find your own sound I think.  But many might think me wrong there.
Also limited choices, perhaps find a sound that works for you and stick with it till you get a good and FINISHED track.

We are starting to build our live show and definitely don't want it to be fully automated. As of now we are running an APC-40 for sequencing and running the show....and a few keyboards/other midi controllers for effects and playing live.

My question to you is.... What is the best way to route effects and loops for just certain tracks and then different effects that work on the entire master?

I was thinking of using the returns, but I'm still not totally sure how that would work. We'd love to for example just loop some of the drums, while sending delay to a synth. Is this achievable without latency and putting the same effect rack on every track?

I'm now seeing the potential for using Live as backing tracks for jazz, R&amp;B and funk music. Having different songs as different scenes and whatnot. In my mind I'm envisioning me singing and playing my 6-string bass along with Live, using the Launchpad to loop solo sections and be able to jam. Does anyone have any experience with this? What are the pros/cons for this? Thanks!

**UPDATE:** Getting closer. I'm finding that my input track (bass track) likes to crackle and distort sometimes. I'm guessing this the memory not being able to buffer. I did have to lower my buffer rate to reduce latency when playing live. Nothing's worse than hearing your pluck just a microsecond behind. It's so weird. I am discovering that by using Live for my input I get the ability to use effects in sync with the tempo. This sounds AMAZING, when it's not distorting, that is.

I graduated with a BA in Music Industry and through that program ended up finishing theory at Music Theory IV. We touched on Classical, and *only* classical, which I hated. It's become really hard to connect a lot of my theory knowledge to anything since we never analyzed things like EDM, Hip-Hop, or Rock.

I've been learning Ableton over the past few months but struggled keeping interest using a mouse, I want to touch knobs. I bought a Xone:K2 and mapped a few things, but hated that I had to continually change mappings, I wanted something like an APC. I also have a Launchpad and while it's nice to launch clips, there's not much else to do without complex scripts that I couldn't wrap my head around.

The Push seems to combine everything I want in one package... but I can't help but feel that since I'm not really 'producing' anything good that maybe dropping $600 on a controller isn't the best course of action? I'm still watching plenty of tutorials and dicking around in Ableton...


Just wondering if anyone has been in the same situation and what your thoughts are before I (stupidly) drop too much money.

Was wondering if anyone had this kind of setup?

From what I can tell (reading online), others have gotten it working. This week I am going to embark on setting this up, with a real time kernel (better latency hopefully than I could ever get on windows), using the *cringe* pos-m-audio fast track interface (routing it all through jack, of course).

A big part of this is the curiosity dealing with latency. Running on win7 ultimate 64 bit, the lowest latency I can get stable at 50% usage is 128 samples. This is just unacceptable for me, as I do live recording. The endless windows page faults are just killing the ability to get a lower latency. Perhaps it may also be the m-audio (such a piece of shit). 

Anyway, anyone have any experience in this? I have the general workflow of how to get it installed in my head. I will post here later this week, detailing my steps, whether I get it working or not.

edit: I got things working, unfortunately I could not get the fast track pro to respond - it would just output static. The steps I took:

    install curl 
    install playonlinux 
    install ttf-mscorefonts 
    add 32 bit architecture support 
    run play on linux
    create a new instalation (64 bit)
    install wine 1.5.23 - set version to windows 7
    install winetricks 
    using winetricks, install visual C++ 2008 libraries, mono210, quicktime72 
    install ableton 9
    download wineasio
    download asio.h from steinbergs ASIO SDK and copy to wineasio dirrectory
    install libjack0, libjack-dev, libc6-dev-i386, lib32stdc++6, ia32-libs, gcc-multilib, g++-multilib
    install wine1.4.1-dev
    build, install,register wineasio
    install and configure real time kernel
    modify rtirq and add usb1 device to non-threaded list

 [x-post AbletonProductions]",pistacchio,13,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ableton/comments/18lekg/state_rabletonproductions_and_sharing_of_our/,"Hi, while waiting for Ableton Live 9 and Push to come out, I've fired up Renoise, the popular tracker, after a long time. While not as popular as Ableton (you'd be able to find so much less tutorials and forums dedicated to it), it has a lively community that regularly hangs around on IRC and I joined their chat. This reminded me a lot of when, years ago, I was involved with the tracker community.

One thing that I really miss is how the medium itself, music modules, helped creating a community: being able to dissect other people tracks to see ""how he did this"", steal techniques and grab samples, really boosted the interest for each other music and that's what, I think, favored the raise of organized groups of musicians and virtual friendships. Great old times.

Today I was lurking r/AbletonProductions and I noticed how any submitted song has, at most, a couple of comments and most have none (you can check this right now). This is quite sad: you spend hours (days? weeks?) putting your best effort into a project, you pour your soul and a bit of yourself in it hoping that other people would appreciate it and give comments on how they like it, or criticism on how to make it even better and in the end all you can get is a couple of distracted upvotes.

I think it is a problem of ""rising the bar"", it's what the ""community"" aims for that make a community harder to gather. Ableton is a professional product and everybody's hero is the lone superstar DJ making people dance from above the stage, alone behind his MacBook and hidden among his gear. You want to be the one on the stage and not the one dancing. In the tracker community your heroes were a group of people releasing breathtaking demos. You could easily reach them on IRC, but you won't be allowed to be part of the group, so you worked hard to get better, improve your music and finally gain appreciation by the people you think so highly of: it was a real ""social"" endeavor. 

The communities that I see here are really ""selfish"" (don't get me wrong on this), everybody seems to only talk about ""me"" and this makes a community harder to form, I think. You come to the forum to *exploit* it, make people tell you how to make that certain sound on Ableton, and go back working on your corner. Some people release amazing tutorials, but it's always a relationship of the kind ""ME -&gt; ALL OF YOU"" and never ""WE"".

Technically, everybody wants to reach the most professional sounding result by making use of the latest multi-gigabytes string library.
It would be an interesting project to make it emerge an old school, tracker-like community by working on projects done solely with the instruments and effects that Live provides (and some embeddable samples): the sonic possibilities are endless, I never feels ""constrained"" when I don't have access to thousands of different synths. Trying to ""limit"" yourself to Analog, Operator and the like (and mixing, sampling, layering them) is a real boost for creativity and it would make it possible to have smaller Ableton project to share and build a vibrant, real community of ever learning musicians who share songs, ideas, tricks, instruments.

So I'm starting to learn Live for DJing, as it will make my life a lot simplier just lugging my laptop and APC40 around instead of my CD players, mixers, effects unit, etc.

What I'm having trouble on is something quite small, but can't work out the logic.
I'm trying the basic transitioning that I do as a DJ on a mixer, take out the bass in one track and bring it in on the other track slowly at the same time.
I've set effects on Deck A to EQ Three, then EQ Three on Send A. However when the track goes through the Send A I can here both the original and the returned from the effect unit, thus cancelling out the EQ.

If that made any sense what so ever, what's the way to work around this?

I use Ableton for DJing and lets say I have a track at 128 BPM.  Master tempo is set to 128 BPM.  I add a marker at the first beat then click warp 128 from here. Why does it not warp correctly?  The only way to get the track I'm working on to be correctly in sync is to literally warp every single beat.  It starts off at 128 then I have to move the next beat and it will show something like 125 for that one then the next beat I will have to move and it will be 131.

Setup and performance for DJing but for untraditional and more interesting performance.,ACore423,13,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/ableton/comments/1ge7of/help_for_a_new_user_setup_and_performance_for/,"First off, let me start by saying to all the DJs out there if I say anything insulting, I don't mean harm. Hell, I have no idea what I'm doing but I have an idea of how I want to do things. 
I come from old punk/indie band and have performed like that. Well, I found myself at a show last night and really made me want to perform. I've been producing electronic music for a while but I also want to mix other tracks. I'm wanting to DJ and handle long sets but that would be hard playing just my tracks alone haha. 
But I want to step away from the traditional path. The DJ's last night were fun and all, but they lacked ""emotion."" Not really into it and about the only thing they did that took concentration was beat matching and smooth transition of tracks. But myself, want to make things more interesting. I want to manipulate tempos and dynamics. I don't just want to beat match and move a cross fader. In fact I don't want to ever put headphones on to track to see if everything lines up. I want to play and know everything is on track because I made it that way. 
If that makes any sense.

I want to DJ just like I played with bands in the past. Where every set was different depending on how we wanted to play. Slowing down and speeding up, fillers here and there, just whatever I can think of without the constraints of a locked tempo. I don't want a dancefloor of robots who dance to the same four to the floor rhythm. I want to trip them up and make them feel what they are dancing to.
Again, not downing DJ's. Just trying to describe what I want.  
Anyway, after some research I feel Ableton is the best for this.  
Now, if you were able to interpret this, what are some ideas of accomplishing this? 
Please and thank you.

I have been asked to setup a workshop at Futureworks, Manchester, that would cover music production using Ableton.

I was hoping you guys could give me some advice on what you would expect to learn from a 101 introductory course.

I've been asked to cover basic production, such as workflow, how to label things, how to bring up piano roll, etc (the bare basics). As well as teaching performance, like how to map a midi controller to use for your performance and things like that.

I've been using Ableton for about 3 years now, and I use it for literally everything that has to do with performance and production. Before that, I was using Logic Pro.

Anyways, all advice is very helpful and greatly appreciated!

tl;dr: Setting up an Ableton 101 course to teach at my university. If you took it, what would you hope to learn?

**UPDATE:** Thanks everyone for all the advice. This is all helping me a lot. I think once I get the course all planned out, I'll try filming some lessons and get your opinions on how I can critique them. Thanks a lot guys, and carry on wielding weapons of sound!

I'm having a little trouble with little tick pauses and speaker puffs when I change tracks in session view. I have a whole bunch of songs all in one so I can perform. I'm running at about 40% CPU usage. I thought, if I froze the midi effects and sounds and put them in an audio track I could get rid of some of that CPU usage. It might take me a while so I thought I'd ask to see if anyone tries this or if it will work. 

thanks,

edit: dang, that did not take very long. I went from 30% to 10% with freezing. Also, I didn't change them to audio tracks, just froze the track. i'ma noooob.

edit2: now the frozen tracks are all weird skippy sounding. I'm investigating... 

edit3: so I guess freezing tracks is for cutting CPU down. And flattening is for the clip to turn to audio. So google is awesome and now reddit has a record of my noobery. I won't delete this just incase anyone wants to add something

So far I have only organized by sample library with 128s. 

I'm in the middle of setting up my drum rack which includes several chains with samplers in them for different instruments (3 samplers grouped into one chain for layered kicks for example). I usually have eq, a compressor, and reverb on each sampler inside the chains inside my drum rack to manipulate each sound in my kicks individually. Do you guys do that?

I have a Spectrum on the entire drum rack for EQing.

I'm wondering how you guys have set up your workflow. Do you do something similar? Do you work with effect racks?

I don't want to sidechain the entire thing, because I don't want the entire bass sound to cut off when the snare kicks in, only when the kick does, I just want it to dip about 5 or so dB at 200Hz when the snare hits to give it room, I still want the other frequencies to be just as loud as normal.

I know I could probably do this by automating the dB of a cut in the EQ, but I don't want to worry about that if I want to move the snare around, I want it to be automatic.

Another way I thought of doing it, is by using an effects rack with 3 chains, one chain EQing so it's only 150 Hz and lower, another EQ'd so only 150-250Hz is cutting through, and another so 250Hz is cutting through. And side chain the chain that's 150-250Hz, but that's kind of messy and uses too much effects.

So what's the most efficient way to do this? Is there a specific audio effect in Ableton that can sidechain specific frequencies?",,False,self,t5_2re1a,False,,,True,t3_1k1rju,http://www.reddit.com/r/ableton/comments/1k1rju/how_can_i_sidechain_only_specific_frequencies_to/,

If you add a low constant bass sound, after wards you add effects to that track, does your sound get chopped 2 or 3 ms? like a short crackle? like a sample you cut and you didnt hit the point where the wave went through the zero point?? try different effects. vinyl distortion or phaser or so.

And does the same happen when you activate oder deactivate the effects?

I know we are a very tiny community of only 70 people, but I wanted to know if anyone knew of any **good song composition tutorial videos** for Ableton Live from start to finish. If I do a youtube search for tutorial videos in Ableton, they usually just tell you how to accomplish a particular technique and not what goes into an entire song. It's worth noting I have absolutely **ZERO** formal training in music theory. I don't know what a chord progression is, what it means to keep things ""in key"" or what key I should select when sampling a particular instrument.

For instance, some burning questions for an electronic music composer:

* What skeleton *song structure* should one try to follow as a beginner?
* What should carry the song in general? The bassline? Melodies in different parts of the song? A bit of both?
* How do you compose an original melody? Using an arpeggio left and right is a sign of weakness... so what makes good bass notes, melody notes, etc?
* When is it good to add pads or atmosphere?
* What are best practices for making it so the sound spectrum doesn't get drowned out (I know simple things like side-chaining with the kick, but in the mid to high frequencies I'm pretty lost)
* How do you make a purely instrumental electronic song stay interesting in the lack of any vocal track?
* What makes a song sound ""cohesive"" and can you offer any tips on how to bridge different segments of songs without making them sound like 2 unrelated ideas pasted next to each other?

I would like to make electronic music... particularly downtempo, electro, or ambient. I know they're unrelated, but it's just the type of music I like so I'm willing to try at any of those. I'm not interested in dubstep.

This became more apparent to me when I created a submission for last month's Squarepusher remix competition and listened to other other entries.

I suspect it's either a matter of loudness that can hopefully be fixed by using a limiter and boosting the gain (without overdoing it), or it's a matter of the sound stage (panning, reverb, etc)—I have some nerve damage in one of my ears that makes that part a little more difficult for me. It could be something else completely, which is why I'd love to get outside feedback.

I do know, that my overall loudness is way lower than all the other tracks I hear, and I tend to get ear fatigue when I'm trying to critically listen to my tracks, which may be just because I have to turn the volume up so much.

",thavy,13,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ableton/comments/19vzzr/using_a_keyboard_as_a_midi_controller_help_please/,"Hello everyone!

I've been using Ableton for a while now and am getting comfortable with it. 
I remembered that my sister used to have a Yamaha keyboard, the PSR-172 version, 
which is kinda old considering she had it for at least 6-7 years or more. 

To connect it to my PC, I used a Yamaha USB-MIDI Interface UX16 cable, 
plugged the MIDI IN and OUT parts of it to the keyboard and plugged the USB to my Laptop. 
Now, in the Preferences tab of Ableton, I am able to see the UX16 and everything. 
(I assume it means everything is setup well?)

Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/ZPdOeBh.jpg

However, whenever I press keys on the keyboard, nothing happens. 
The square in the upper right corner doesn't show any input from the keyboard.
Any idea why? 

Thanks in advance!

So I'm working with a session guitarist who essentially wants a live looper for a gig he's got coming up. 

What I have set up is 3 instances of the Looper so he can layer stuff on top of himself. What he wants is a ""Chorus"" button, that stops the audio and restarts all the loops again when he presses play. It would work perfectly if we were using Clips, because when you hit stop it stops everything. But since its all within the looper it just restarts from where we pressed stop.

I'm looking for a decent keyboard with aftertouch, and some control surfaces. Portability is nice. Actually, I *think* I want aftertouch; I'm nothing special, but from what I understand, you can get a fair amount of extra feeling into the notes if you got an aftertouch keyboard.

I was thinking of the nanoKONTROL2 and nanoPAD2 ($100 total). Those give me drum pads, XY, and a set of sliders/knobs and transport control. I tried TouchDAW on a Nexus 7 but it seemed a bit finicky - is there any other good Android controllers for Live? (I don't want to buy Apple devices.)

Leaves $300 for a keyboard, which could get a SL MKii 25 used, although it seems a bit bulky (can't toss in backpack). Plus is there any point in a nanoKONTROL if I have a keyboard like the MKii with all those surfaces?

Impulse 25 might fit the bit with the nano devices for more control surfaces.

Are the Novation keys good? I hear people complaining about build quality. I tried an M-Audio and wasn't impressed, and I've heard they have compat issues. Novation's marketing is really to-notch.

Or should I forget a controller keyboard with aftertouch and just get the Korg 37 key mini? (Why doesn't Novation make a 37?)

I've got a launchpad but it's a bit slow to switch functions, so it's only really useful for clip launch, midi playing, or custom mapping.

I'm just making music on the side to relax, techno/ambient stuff. Sorry for the rambling. Any advice is much appreciated.

Then it goes back to normal after the next sequence of notes. Because I can better SHOW you the problem, I will [HERE](http://i.imgur.com/lh9IPy5.jpg). 

It is a Massive synth and it is set to be polyphony. I have also had this issue with my Symphobia VST. In the picture, the one long note sounds out and the other little ones play when they should, all except the first one. And, when I drag all the notes to the very start of the clip, only the little notes play and not the long one. The grid is set to 1/16 and every note is in the correct spot so it's not like the sequencer is missing the start of the note because it's set too far back or something. I even made the same clip in Live 8 and it works correctly. And it's nothing to do with my midi keyboard since I made the clip with my mouse. Oh and when I play the same thing with my fingers on my midi keyboard, it all plays normal like it should. 

The only thing I can think is that there is one little midi setting somewhere OR this is an issue with my 64 bit installation of Live 9 in conjunction with my JBridge software that I had to install in order to run my 32 bit VST plug-ins. I *can* install a 64 bit version of Massive, but I can't do that for all my other VST plugins that are only 32 bit.

Basically it is a way to automate tasks in Live (and other apps on a mac) and assign shortcuts. For example I use alt h to hide the large EQ Eight and Spectrum windows, alt e opens the Note And Audio Editors to full height, and so on.

Working on a live show and on my laptop (MACBOOKPRO1) I am running the sequencing for pretty much the entire show on mine and hopefully some effects and my partner on (MACBOOKPRO2) wants to run a bunch more effects on his and possibly a VST for playing parts live.

My question is how exactly can we connect and are there a lot of latency problems? Since we don't have a ton of money both of our personal computers are going to be used so I want to make sure it's as reliable as possible.

Also, is the best way to run effects live routing our tracks through a return track and running the effects through that and then out through the master?

I came to this subreddit many times searching/asking for a solution, so I'm posting this in case there are others who do the same in the future.

The version of Live Suite 8 that I purchased was an upgrade that required me to first install a version of Live 4 and then upgrade to Live 8. Done. Then I updated to Live 8.4. Done. 

When I went to use Rewire, however, I got the dreaded message that said something like ""Rewire detects a different version....blah blah....open as a stand alone program to reset rewire....blah blah"". Opening Ableton as a stand-alone program changed nothing.

**Problem:** I then realized that every install and upgrade I had made had created a new version of Ableton - I had 3 different versions of Ableton installed! Live 4, Suite 8, and Suite 8.4 were all resting in my Program folder. No wonder Rewire was confused. I thought each update/upgrade was replacing the previous version. Not so.

**Solution:** I then did a complete re-install of Windows 7 Pro64 and  Cubase 6 + updates. Then, instead of re-installing Ableton beginning with Live 4, I went to my Ableton account, downloaded Live 8.4, and installed *only* that version. Afterwards, everything worked perfectly.

I did get the dreaded message once more, but this time when I opened Ableton as a stand alone program, Rewire reset as it should.

&gt;Hi Friends
&gt;
&gt;My 1st live performance Scenario 1. 
&gt;
&gt;Pre arranged song made in arrangement/linear fashion. I am karaoking myself, while I sing and do some fill in little guitar solos here and there. Voice and guitar I play live not looped up until I need to start layering the song with voice and guitar loops as a way to make song interesting and have a change in dynamics. 
&gt;
&gt;Track 1: Pre recorded guitar
&gt;TRack 2: Pre recorded drum
&gt;Track 3: Pre recorded bass
&gt;Track 4: Where I want to loop a guitar riff while performing live
&gt;Track 5: Where I want to loop a voice riff while playing live. 
&gt;
&gt;-How do I set these new loops to start recording, and end recording, and be able to undo if I blow it.
&gt;-How do I stop any of the new loops I recorded, but the song keeps going?
&gt;-Would I arm both tracks from the get go? Or would I need to while performing arm 1, then disarm the other etc?
&gt;-How could markers be helpful?
&gt;-Which type of controller would be best suited for this? Keyboard? Ableton Novation launcher? 
&gt;
&gt;Keep in mind I would have a guitar in my hands. Im thinking about providing a count ins to the loops so i have time to have my hands do the travelling to whatever controller I may use.

Some of the Skinning options don't work with Live 8. I tried contacting the developer but never heard back after the initial contact.

I made a skin I really like (Got really tired of looking at the pink automation lanes) but I think it could be better.
The default colors for samples inside Simpler and Sampler kill me. 

I tried using a Hex Editor to further edit the Skin files but no luck. I've had some programming (C+) but I'm not skilled enough to take on this project alone. I am a fast learner, really good with computers and can definitely contribute. Just need someone to point me the right way. 

Here's a screenshot of the Skin I made. It can improve.

I have used the 'Manage Set' function to search for and find the samples, but that doesn't solve the VST issue.

The VST issue:

When I load a tune, it says ""VST plugin not found."" I have not updated Ableton. When I load a tune, the tracks will show, and I can even click the configure button on the VST which pulls open the instrument! I can add new tracks and they work fine. The old tracks, while it appears they have loaded, will not produce sound, and it is impossible to press the record button.

Does anyone have a clue? I've been on the eugooglie for the past day, to no avail.

He has me working mostly with beats (beginner stuff, time signatures, grooves, some sound tweaking). We do a lot of reverse engineering of stuff I dig and it's been very rewarding.

My question is: I'd like to work on some Bollywood beats. I don't a more specific name for the name of this style of music (Bhangra?). So far I've been using kits from Impulse and this gets the basic idea across but where could I find a pack, collection, or kit that uses more authentic traditional Indian instruments? That is, percussion for now but I'd really like to find a harmonium and sintar at some point in the future. I've googled around, found some loops, etc. but I really want to do this the hard way, learn what I'm doing and get some unique sounds out of this. 

And here's a great example of my inspiration. I'd like to build on this energetic, bouncy type of beat (some may find this over-the-top silly but oh well):

So far, I have hit a few walls. Mostly my problem comes from synth noises, as I seem to have very few that sound good. All of the ableton default preset ones, like electric and operator, don't quite sound like what I am looking for.  
  
From watching tutorials, it seems like most people fiddle with the knobs and controls to get a sound they want, but I am just so lost at the sheer amount of things to modify, and most things I change I cant hear the difference.  
  
Is there any kind of tutorial that covers all of the parameters? How did you start to learn all of the little caveats you can change?  
  
Also, about the synth sounds: how exactly would I go about getting more synths? I figured out I can use simpler to have any sound I want like a synth, but sometimes this seems out of tune.  
  
Are new synths actually new module things (IE: analog, electric, collision, etc) or is it something else ?

Look at these [two plots,](http://imgur.com/a/QpVJq)  over the master bus, exactly the same tune. 

First plot is the EQ8 analyser, second is Voxengo Span ( the more accurate )  The EQ8 looks like I need to hack out a whole bunch of bass and mid below 400hz when it's not the case at all. I know this because my ADAM A7X's, NS10 and Beyer DT150 aren't telling me I need to and I've also tested the tune at my mates PA prep warehouse on two different Funktion One rigs too ( as I like to )  The bass end is solid. 

FTR: In this Dub/Drum and bass mix, 60hz is the sub, 150-200Hz is the chest punch kick and the bass end of the snare. There's a slight hole between 1-2khz for the vocal to cut through and the hats are loops pretty sharp up to 8K. 

The Eq8 reads like this on all of the mixes I run it over in real time too, just a massive bass spike.  

You can't adjust the scale enough to anywhere near compensate either. 

Basically before I ran some tests over several different systems with several different analysers including Smaart, Room Eq wizard ( for the room obviously )  Voxengo Span and the Logic Pro analyser ( in the box ) the Eq8 had me believing I had some serious room issues in the bass end which is totally not the case. 

Not good Ableton, not good at all. 

Anyone else using the EQ8 and getting similar results?

Hoping someone can help me out. I'm using Ableton Live 8 on Windows 7. (Suite, if it matters. I don't think it does though.) I use the Launchpad to launch, play, mix, all that jazz. When I try mapping my crossfader to buttons anywhere on the launchpad (whether it be in Session, User 1, User 2, or in Mixer) I get an odd noise (that is either high pitched or low depending on where on the device I mapped it) whenever I have my fader set to ""B."" This sound happens anytime I click with my mouse, or when I press a button on my Launchpad. Now, when I set the Crossfader in the center, or to ""A,"" the sound will stop. This is really, *really* annoying when I'm trying to practice DJing. I have a performance in a week, and I'd really like to be able to DJ using the Launchpad and be able to do so without this obnoxious noise. If anyone can help, I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks!

Where is the best place to start besides fiddling around?

Can I record input from audio interface in Ableton or do I need a vst?

The problem is regarding the 'hold' function of Live's arpeggiator device (in-built midi device version).

The problem is that when I hold down a chord on my keyboard while the arpeggiator is activated, the keys arpeggiate perfectly - except for the fact they do not continue to 'hold' or sustain after I release the keys, even when the 'hold' button is activated. 

I tested this fault out with a spare old keyboard a friend lent to me, and the hold function performed as it should, which leads me to suspect it may be a problem/setting on my Roland keyboard.. Though I could be wrong. 

My hardware is: 

-Early 2011 Macbook Pro

-Ableton Live 8.1.4

-Roland juno-106 programmable polyphonic sythnthesizer keyboard




Any help/advice is greatly appreciated.

Anyway - I've just downloaded the trial and been through the lessons included but I'm still stuck on how to do something really basic - extract samples from a song and arrange them to make a re-edit.

I can see from google that there are thousands of videos on YouTube which would help me immensely but unfortunately I'm in Shanghai and the Chinese government (lovely, lovely people I'm sure) just don't want the population to watch cat videos and fail compilations so YouTube is a bust. 

As such, to make the most of my 30 day trial I need to find some alternative ways of learning the gear, particularly sampling. I don't really want to do anything crazy with FX or instruments - I just want to be able to take old disco and funk tunes and re-edit them for my own use - I know this is something that Ableton is good at, but I just can't work it out. 

So far I've just managed to drag and drop an mp3 into the Ableton window, switch to simpler(maybe sampler, I'm not sure), highlight and crop a bit of the track and then put that on the keyboard. Its not properly 'warped' though - how do I do this? Also unsure how I would get multiple samples from the same mp3. 

I'm sure this is in the manual somewhere but I don't even know what I should be looking for, most of the parts about samples seem to be about using them as instruments, rather than just looping them and arranging the loops... 

Also any tutorials on how to use Ableton as a DJ platform would be good - it's not really what I want it for (I normally use traktor and I'm pretty happy with it) but I'd be interested in giving it a try over the next 3 days.

Currently, I have each song in my band's set assigned to a single MIDI channel. This includes one Instrument Rack where I can split up the various sounds across the octaves of the MIDI controller. I then assign certain samples and loops that are sitting in various clip slots to keys on the keyboard, or buttons that are also using that single MIDI channel. Some of these samples need to be quantized to the metronome, which I send to the drummer so that the loops can be in sync with the drums. As far as I know, this means I can't use the sampler or the drum rack to trigger these samples, they need to be assigned to clip slots.

The problem I'm running in to is that now we have a hell of a lot more than 16 songs, so I need to be able to swap in and out songs and assign them to different MIDI channels. Doing so with the Instrument Rack is easy, but as far as I know, this means I'd have to manually reassign every sample clip to the new MIDI channel.

I'm wondering if there is an easy way to take a group of Clip Slots and keep the MIDI assignments, but just change the channel that is assigned to them? I realize this is a rare case, so I'm not keeping my hopes up. :}

Its the strangest thing I have ever seen. I will list my specs as follows and try to give as much detail as possible.

My setup is:

1. Ableton 9 Suite 32-bit
1. Ableton Push 
1. Macbook Pro mid 2010
1. Presonus Firebox
1. Oxygen 61 midi controller






Some more Detail:

 I have experienced this while trying to use the push sequencer and it throws everything off. Restarting the computer, Starting a new set. I even went directly out of my computer to the Monitors and used the core audio driver instead of the Presonus Driver. Still to no avail I am having the issue. I have just now unplugged the push to see if the issue is still caused. Unfortunately I think it might be the culprit. If anyone has had this issue please get with me thanks guys.

TL;DR: I think my push is causing my arrangement time to skip forward into the thousands and it makes me sad.

Would it be a great advantage to me if I updated to windows 7 64bit system and ran ableton 9 in 64-bit and bought more ram?

Also my sample library is on an external drive would prob make sense to buy a new internal hd.

I'd prefere to do this than buy a new rig as money is tight atm.

Nevermind, i figured it out.  Instead of the chord being held out, i had it playing as 16th notes back to back, on all the tones of the chord.

They are the most obvious with lower frequency sounds and when i do it while there is a high amplitude in the wave form eg. Sinewave goes through zero.(means sometimes its a louder crackle sometimes almost none).

I used DPCLatency check and Latency Mon which both state taht my system can handle Realtime Audio.

And of cousre i used different Buffersizes.

Specs: Windows 7 64 Bit
          Asus P6T
          Core i7 920

          Fireface UC.
          Ableton (32 bit) installed.

To solve the problem I bought a new pci to usb card to get an additional usb controller that is only connected to my soundcard. (i tryd various connection combinations). Problem persists.Followed the most ""real time audio optimization posts"" in the internet.



disabled Asus AI tweak for power control.

One thing is very interesting:

In the Tool: ""USBDeview""
which lists all the connected and not connected Usb devices, the Ableton push(the only device that pulls 500mA) is stated as a USB 1.1 device, that it runs via USB 1.1. (Yes i connected the powersupply to push)

Had sb the same problem?

Can sb confirm with the USBDeview tool that Push runs smooth on his system when switching between tracks or session and note view (basically when it recieves larger amounts of data from Ableton live) even though its stated USB 1.1? Or should it be a USB 2.0 device.

Thanks in advance.

I bought an MPKmini recently to use with Ableton. I have an ideal set up for live production (meaning, a list of things I want to be able to do), and my first goal is to get that set up active and to understand it.

One of my goals is to be able to play drum samples (right now it's Drum Rack, is that the right choice?) on the pads while using a synth (Operator) on the keys. I'm having trouble assigning MIDI controls to both. 

If I open a new Live Set and add a Drum Rack track, the MIDI controls work fine- the notes can be assigned to different samples in the rack and I can configure the specific notes in the MPKmini editor. If afterwords I create a new track with an Operator, however, all MIDI control is assigned to Operator, including the pads. Once I do this I cannot reassign control to the Drum Rack, even by deleting the new Operator track. The same works in reverse (if an Operator is created first, control will work fine until I add a Drum Rack at which point the controls will be overridden). 

I'm not the most fluent with Ableton (like I said, trying to establish/understand my first set-up), so feel free to talk basics with me if there's something big that I'm missing.

Audio seemed to be playing up on my pc for example I was looking for samples on my browser whilst ableton was in the background with an open project, things like youtube or ccmixter were not playing audio.

So I shut down ableton and it started working again. Which I paid no mind to at this point. now ableton doesn't get past the loading screen without the message ""A serious program error has occured. This application will shut down after this message box is closed. ADefaultWinSystemExpceptionHandler::HandleStageOne""

Everything seems to cause it, the only time I can ever get the program to boot is if I remove all Plugins, Uninstall ASIO4U and disable all audio devices on the pc. which was just my laptop speakers and my headphones.

All my projects etc are fine as I can get them to load once I've booted ableton sans le everything. I've reinstalled the program to no avail.

I bring in a pre-mastered house track that is up to commercial loudness. put it in a track at 0db. But on the master fader it is in the red? i put a limiter on it and i notice some peaks at +6db? I don't understand this? also when i put a limiter on it appears that my outputs from my sound card are clipping?

1.) after I have made a small session view song what I tried to do was hit the global record button in session view  and perform the piece using the apc 40 and the clip launch buttons.  I the hit stop and switch to arrangement view and I can clearly see things have been recorded but when I hit play no sound is heard.

2.) the other problem I am running into is that when I start recording in arrangement view I then try and create a session view clip and record that into arrangement from session with the global record and again I can see that something is recorded but no sound plays. It also seems to not play anything else I have recorded in arrangement view.

Back with a probably obvious question, but I'm still building our live set and I love all the support I've gotten.

A little backstory, I'm in an house-electro group and we currently broke down all of our tracks into 7 separate audio tracks Bass,kick,snare,perc,vocals,synth,misc....

We are trying to make it easy to remix and create some great breakdowns live, but I'm unsure of the best way to route audio effects like beat repeat, reverb, delay etc.

I also am trying to figure out an easy way to loop parts live. Unlike a dj set where you'd only loop the master there are tons 7 parts.

Is it best to make a return track and run everything through there? It would be nice to have some effects only on the drums and some only on vocals and some on the master. I understand this complicates thing and probably kills cpu, but any ideas would be great. I'm still messing with dummy clips but still don't fully understand the concept...


ALSO,

A giant fear of mine is my Ableton doing that thing it loves to do when a ton of tracks are playing which is to distort and delay playing the track. What is the best way to make sure this won't happen. Is there anything in particular I should focus on deleting on my laptop?

After doing this, the VU meter is boosted, but the actual volume doesn't seem to be. Bringing down the volume afterwards loses the punch of the sample. Is there something I can do to fix this?

I have been messing about with ableton live for the past few months and I feel like when coming into the application with no preconceived notions of what I would like to create I can put together something that sounds okay. However, more recently in order to test myself I have been trying to recreate songs I like part for part. I manage fine getting the right notes and chords and general sequencing but when I try and accurately recreate certain sounds I end up incredibly frustrated and mostly just give up on an accurate recreation.

My question is to those who would consider themselves quite proficient, how easy is it for you to hear a sound and pick the right instrument with the right setting to try and recreate it and how long would you say it took before you were confident doing this?",,False,self,t5_2re1a,False,,,True,t3_1aupvb,http://www.reddit.com/r/ableton/comments/1aupvb/how_do_you_go_about_recreating_sounds_you_here_in/,

How do I set up a comprehensive sample world for improvising?,a5yrold,2,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ableton/comments/1a77oc/improvisational_sample_palette_in_ableton_how_do/,"Hey Crew.  I work in theater sound design and I use Live to manage an improvisational soundscape for the modern dancers I work with.

I have about 400 clips loaded into one live set.  These clips include songs that I've chopped up so I can play only phrases, sound effects, and sound textural environments, all laid out on a massive workspace so that, depending on what the dancers / actors do with their bodies, I can choose new textures and sounds to improvise along with them.

I currently use: an APC40, an APC20, MPD24, and an AKAI mini all running into my macbook pro. Headed out of my macbook pro is a Focusrite Saffire Pro 24 that runs into a 4 channel DJ mixer (which then goes out to the sound system).  I use APCs for most of my sample triggering, and the MPD for one off sound effects or using the drum rack.  The Mini is there in case I want to plunk out a melody.  I run everything out of a DJ mixer in case my rig goes down OR I want to toss some samples in from my phone, or from someone else's ipod. 

My question is.... I'm running all of this off of a single Live set, and it's massive.  It's got 200+ cut up songs in it and half a dozen drum racks.  And it continues to grow as our improvisations grow bigger.  My ideal setting would be to load different moods (mood collections of samples) as the dance improvisations shift, but practically, I can't quit one live set and load another during an improv jam session.  So is this the best setup method? Is there something I'm missing?  Should I just be building a 600+ clip set and load up the beast at the beginning of rehearsal?  Or are there other methods that someone can point me to?

I've looked all over on the web - not many people are using LIVE for improvised dance and contemporary performance / movement - so  I can't find any resources.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
