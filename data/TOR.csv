He emailed me the following:
"" 
- my program of choice is tor: usually the problem is bootstrapping the first handshake in blacklisted internet environment where the routes to the default bridges are unavailable. Also the government may or may not be using deep packet inspection. The alternative is using tor + obfsproxy plugin. But again, the default routes seem to be blocked and the tor client cannot see the updated network state.

The private proxy setup with a friend in spain did not seem to work, can NAT / port forwarding be the issue from the person setting up the bridge?

- If tor doesn't cut it then what is something stronger that works.""

Please help. I don't know what to do.


EDIT: He's telling me ""I think, its stuck loading te geoip file and bootstrapping the first connection""

*  Any browser could be used
*  Once configured, it would be impossible that you could accidentally leak something like a .onion DNS request outside of tor.
*  You could view and work with files from tor from inside the VM.
*  All storage of the VM is contained in known locations of disk image files, which can be contained easily inside of an encrypted drive.

**XINJA MAIL**

(REALLY OLD AND BAD MOCKUP) http://imgur.com/3m7ObEI

Here are the basic features. Screen shots attached.

---

FEATURES:

- SIMPLE Encrypt / Decrypt Email on the fly. Also all incoming and outgoing email using zero-knowledge encryption  ( click the little lock and email is encrypted, click it again it is decrypted)

- Multiple accounts, No reason to sign out of your account to see emails from other accounts. Also send and receive email from multiple accounts including gmail, Yahoo and Live mail as well as the ability to use self destructing and one time use aliases.

**For example your account might look like this:**

John@xinja.com, Main Account
John_Spam@Xinja.com, -  ( Use Spam accounts John_Spam@xinja.com, to sign up for websites and services online. Keep your email unique and spam free. )
John_Family@Xinja.com
John@Gmail.com ( Imported account )
John@Yahoo.com ( Imported account )
John@live.com ( Imported account )
OneTimeUse@Xinja.com (Good for 24 hours then becomes inactive, receiving email also self destructs within 24 hours after being received.)

- #tags, tag incoming and outgoing email for better organization and spam protection.

- “Oops” filter; add a timer so you can make changes to your email if you sent it in haste.

- #Urgent, and #tag notifications.
Use #tags in the subject title to automatically filter importance of email.

**Example:**

to: Wife@xinja.com #Urgent!
don't forget to take billy to soccer!

This email because it has the #urgent tag and will notify you via email, twitter and SMS.
This way you never miss an important email.

** @tags **

**Example:**

@tags used in Calender:

@Calender Fri, Nov 03, 2010 6:15 PM
Don't forget to pick up billy from soccer! #urgent! #milk

The following message would automatically update your calendar as well as send you email, sms and send a tweet to ""Remember The Milk""  to
reminder you on the specified date.

**@tag Example(s): **

@t sends a tweet ( brings up the 140 char limit counter )

@t+username will send a tweet to a specific person. e.g. @t+wife don't
forget the milk! and pick up a pizza for dinner!

@f posts to your facebook status

@f+username posts to a persons wall.

@milk will post to ""Remember The Milk""

@f,t updates your facebook and twitter status.

@sms will send you an sms. e.g. @sms 9:50PM 11/15/10 awesome show on
Discover Channel!
Combine commands.

@t,f
just tweeting and updating my facebook status via my email! yay
technology! #xinja is awesome!!!

**Super user mode: **

(enabled by default) super user mode allows you to rid yourself of options that clog up current email services while minimizing mouse clicks. This will save time and will allow you to do multiple things at one time.

**With Super user mode you can: **

Combine multiple emails as well as twitter, facebook, and calendar updates via one open window.
The following is an example of a single workflow. Only one window was ever opened but all of the following is accomplished using text iput and commands and tags.

** Example. **

To: wife@xinja.com
cc: wife_work@Microsoft.com
Subject: Hey, don't forget to pick up dinner.

Hi Honey, Just wanted to tell you not to forget to pick up #dinner today because the fridge is completely empty.

Pick up some pizza and a six pack of Pepsi. Also, don't forget you have to pick billy up @calender football today at 3:30 PM

love you!

/End

@t having pizza and Pepsi for dinner today whoot woot!

/End

@f I have the most awesome wife in the world

/End

To: work@work.com
cc: boss@work.com
Subject: Leaving early today, wife is bringing home pizza!

Hey boss, just wanted to tell you that the wife coming home late tonight so I want to get him early and surprise her. She's bringing home pizza and pepsi so I want to make sure i'm there before the kids kill it all! The report is finished and will be on your desk tomorrow AM!

/SEND (email sent)

@t,f woot! finished work going home for pizza people!!

/End

@calender, milk

Tomorrow 5:50AM
Remember to put the report on the bosses desk tomorrow!

/Endall

When you type ""/End"" that ends the current thing you are working on greys it out and lets you move down.

My question is as follows: How anonymous is a user with the default settings in Tor? Can I be tracked at all *ever*? How much of a risk am I putting myself in browsing questionable materials like the silk road and similar sites?

As intriguing as the whole thing is, I'd rather not have someone come knocking at my door due to an uneducated mistake I've made that's left me vulnerable.

Second, how well is the deep web policed for scams? With the large variety of things available, I find it hard to believe that it's just a happy-go-lucky black market, and it seems unlikely that there are any legal protections available for transactions involving things that are in a legal/ethical 'gray area.'

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwMr8Xl7JMQ

The people from tor asked all the listeners to help the tor network by getting their own bridge running.

Why? In countries where tor is blocked people can only connect to the tor network with the help of bridges. Bridges behave like EntryNodes, but their IP addresses aren't publicly listed. An obfsproxy bridge informs the tor servers about its existence and then it's up to the tor people to distribute these IP addresses in a manner that the bad guys have a hard time getting many of them.

As I don't have a decent upload speed on my ISP at the moment I decided to take a look at possibility to run a tor bridge at Amazon. It's free in the first year and should cost about ~15 dollars/month afterwards. You can cancel (hassle-free) any time.

Here is how to set up a tor bridge at Amazon: https://cloud.torproject.org/#get_started

For those who don't want to pay: One year is free (in case you don't outrun the 15GB/month, which is very unlikely to happen), it's fun to see it running and it helps to make the world a slightly better place.

onionhash, later renamed to shallot, was the first program to generate customized .onion addresses by brute-forcing the SHA1 hash of the RSA key (by incrementing just the public exponent instead of generating a new RSA key every try).

I've been playing around with shallot and ended up rewriting most of it, except for the main algorithm. Fixed couple bugs, removed some features and added some new ones, most notably, a wordlist search mode - can load up to a billion (have not tried more - need more RAM) of pre-generated human readable word combinations and search for them with almost the same speed as searching for one fixed prefix and faster than if using RegEx. Can fairly quickly (in a day) generate hundreds of names looking like

    deadstream3ecdim.onion
    longuglytreeqh5p.onion
    pageseekcost5aga.onion
    seedneedgoldcf6m.onion

Silly, but might be useful to someone. Of course, eschalot can also search using a RegEx or a fixed prefix, but it's slow. Scallion running on a fast GPU will be much faster for that purpose.

Needs Unix or Linux to compile. Source code, detailed README, and binaries for Tails-0.17 are available on my little website:[blacksunhq56imku.onion](http://blacksunhq56imku.onion)

I am trying to gauge interest in the reliable, modern hosting of hidden services.

There are a few things I am trying to accomplish with this:

 * Anonymity - I don't want to know who you are, and don't want you to know who I am.
 * Hosted on Icelandic or Swedish servers most likely (probably a combination of the two, for redundancy)
 * No logging
 * As much encryption as makes sense
 * Potentially other goals that I am overlooking (looking for feedback!)

I am wondering if people would be interested in:

 * Would you be interested in app servers - like rails, django, other platform as a service stuff (like heroku.com)? These would be able to host apps and would be behind a load balancer behind a hidden service.
 * Would you be interested in something that just hosts static HTML (kind of like neocities.org) 
 * Both? Something else?

I am also wondering how I can fund the initial hosting of this. I'm thinking we'd collect some small fee so that we can pay for hosting (bitcoin), or collect donations. I am willing to donate my time to actually develop and maintain the server, I just need to make sure that the costs of hosting scale with the # of users using the service, so a bitcoin for-pay service makes sense. Not interested in profit, just want to provide this service.

Initially the # of users using the service would be so small that it wouldn't cover the cost of a single VPS - so I'd need to collect some up-front bitcoin donations to make sure at least 3 months (should be under 1.5btc) of hosting is secured. Hopefully after 3 months there would be enough interest to have enough people hosting sites to pay for itself.

Thoughts?

I have some questions about me running a tor exit node from my house. I have a pretty capable computer for most things and It would most-likley more than be able to handle running an exit node with 8gb of RAM and an Intel Core i7-3610QM CPU (2.30GHz) which is my weakest component. I plan to upgrade the RAM in the near future if that's important at all. I honestly don't know how much memory running an exit node would require. I have an Internet Connection with Rogers that has a 120GB bandwidth cap. I have way more bandwidth than I need, I can spare about 50GB of my bandwidth. I have a 9.083mb/s download speed and a 0.537mb/s upload speed according to speedtest.net (used the Toronto, ON server hosted by telus).

I've heard of people getting in trouble for running exit nodes. Some people have been raided, had their devices confiscated. I really need to keep myself out of as much legal trouble as possible but I still wish to do this. Is there any way to keep myself out of trouble? I live in the province of Ontario in Canada. Is there any chance of me getting in trouble in my location? If so how likely is it. 

Finally, I'm wondering if it's possible to run an exit node through a VPN. I will most likely not do this unless there is a medium to high risk of me getting in some legal trouble. Maybe I'm being too paranoid? I'm not sure, I live with a family so I don't want to get anyone in trouble because of me.

I have a rooted Android running Cyanogenmod 7.x. I plan on upgrading my device in the near future and will repeat the process of rooting. For now, I have to make do with what the device I have.

I have growing concerns, okay paranoia, about my privacy. I was referred to Tor, did some reading, and even found Orbot and installed it on my device. As it is, all apps on my device are funneled (transparent proxy?) through Orbot (Tor). I also have Orweb, which is a very stripped down browser that is also created though the Tor Project. I've never had an issue with bootstrapping and all appears to be fine. I'm not a programmer, so there are limits to my skills.

The browser (Orweb) was horrid... not tabs, no bookmarking, nothing. Still  I can check my Tor connection and all appears fine. I get the assuring message from the https://check.torproject.org That my browser is configured to use Tor.

But the browser (Orweb) sucks donkey balls, if im totally honest. So, i also downloaded Firefox and Proxy Mobile add-on, configured as described through Tor. (I disabled the Google, Amazon, Twitter, and Wikipedia addons that came with Firefox). I can even get the connection message as I've seen using the Orbot browser.

1). I know I should approach all things concerning privacy with skepticism and Id like to know if any of you have experience (or warnings) about this particular setup? My Android is my main device.

2).  I'd like to know if there are other preparations I should make before an exploration of the onions. What are some of the sorts of things I should ""pack for my trip""? I downloaded and installed KeePassDroid (password management), K-9 (email), Yaaic (although I'll admit, I don't know the first thing about IRC), OI File Manager, and AGP (I don't know wtf I'm doing with it yet)... 

3). What can I do to better secure my device (ie., encryption apps, etc)?

4). What can I use to create public keys (for use in sending and receiving encrypted mail, along with encrypted attachments)?

5). What are some othe facets of my device I should be concerned about (ie., Google email attached to the device)?

6). Any recommendations for secure contacts management? Apps? Services?

7). Last question for now: considering my current setup, should I have very big concerns about emails/texts coming through my device while I'm running Tor?

1376298678.0,8,self.TOR,1k748o,Is it risky to use Tor for everyday accounts? Especially alongside anonymous accounts?,welptimetotryagain,19,11,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/1k748o/is_it_risky_to_use_tor_for_everyday_accounts/,"It seems the rule of thumb is to keep your clearnet and anonymous browsing separate. However, I was wondering if anyone used Tor for their everyday accounts. Is this secure? If not, why not? 

For example, using the Android app Gibberbot, one can route their IMs through Orbot to get Tor protection. The incentive for one's anonymous accounts to use this are obvious, but could one also have have their everyday accounts route through Tor alongside as well? 

In my case, obviously, the IM providers would know who I am (as I would use my real name, and having signed up with a normal IP prior), but by using Tor my ISP would not be able to see what I'm doing, and the exit node would be unable to see anything important (because of the SSL). Plus, as a bonus,  I could help improve Tor's anonymity by including ""boring"" communications in the stream. But will having two “identities” interfere with each other? 

Another example, if I were to have Facebook open in one tab, and an autonomous webmail account open in another, would Facebook be able to detect the second account? Note, I'll be running a vanilla Tor Bundle Browser, except with JavaScript turned off. 

The only potential negatives I find with this setup are as follows: the concern that a malicious exit node would do a Man-in-the-middle/fake SSL attack (as apparently occurred [back in 2009](http://hackaday.com/2009/02/23/sslstrip-hijacking-ssl-in-network/)). Is this still a serious possibility? And the second is the possibility for tracking cookies, if I sign into a personal webmail or other account (Aka, the Facebook example above). Can one's everyday accounts leak into one's anonymous accounts? How does that occur? 

Anything else I should look out for? I apologize if these are fairly simple questions, I'm fairly new to Tor, and not at all technical in nature. Thanks.

I guess what I primarily want to know is if if Obfsproxy will hide that I use Tor without creating any potential security risks, if it's the best option, how likely I am to fuck up the installation, and how much you would recommend using it vs. not using it.

That's why I use Tor when I reddit. I've had no problem browsing Reddit via Tor, but when I signed up for a user name and password I was not able to log in. 
 
If anyone else had this problem: one option is to click on the ""S!"" icon up top, go down to ""options,"" click on the padlock shaped icon ""HTTPS,"" and then take the check mark out of the box for ""Enable Automatic Secure Cookies Management."" After you do that you can log in to your reddit account and then go right back in there and check the box again if you want. You will be able to stay logged in because the cookie from reddit will remain until you start your Tor browser session over again unless you manually clear your history (in the ""Tools"" menu).
 
I tried to make this post simple and clear for other people who might have had the same problem, but I'd also like to ask a question of the non-newbies here. Is my reddit cookie visible to other websites that I might visit? Is it possible for my psudo-identity to be tracked from site to site? 
 
My concern is that if websites decided to share user data then it would be possible for them to use that one cookie to track me. They might not know much about me at first, but at least they know that I am redditor named Pat. I know that reddit connects each new cookie that I get when I log back in to ""Pat,"" in order to make the site usable, but what if they decided to share and update the identity ""Pat"" with it's corresponding cookie?
 
In that case I could imagine other websites (reddit data sharing partners) learning quite a lot about ""Pat"" over time, just by watching what websites I spend time on. They might even report back to reddit, enabling reddit to become a centralized hub of information about my browsing habits.

In particular I could do with a few people who can help by connecting and talking to each other, then reporting back on latency, quality etc. and also people who can run wireshark with different clients and check for server and client anonymity leaks.

1)Secure HDD (wipe drive, clean install,disable paging file, etc)

2)Download tor browser

3)download truecrypt

4)create truecrypt hidden volume on removable media

5)Install Virtualbox

6)Setup VM with damn small linux acting as firewall, enable network adapter 2 as internal network, etc

7)log in DSL and turn on ssh, ifconfig eth1 10.0.3.1, etc. Save snapshot

8)Get ubuntu, setup VM on truecrypt hidden volume (Primary)

9)Login primary, setup mainuser, download updates, install guest addons, etc

10)Set ubuntu to use tor as internet connection via changing network adapter from nat to internal network, edit firefox settings to manually use proxy settings, terminal and ifconfig eth0 10.0.3.2, etc

12) Check tor connectivity, should be good to go.

I know the majority of people here have extensive knowledge on tor, perhaps even ubuntu/dsl. Sadly, I have hardly any for all. I also know it must get very annoying have new guys like myself bombard you with questions so for reading this even I thank you very much.

To me, if this all works and is true, it would seem pretty secure, more so than just using the TBB; firewall controlling connections, a VM of ubuntu to access, stored in a hidden truecrypt volume that's stored on a flash drive or something. I know this may seem overkill, but my goal is to be as secure as possible; one of my aforementioned friends had a particular nasty run in with vengeful parties in a similar environment (not tor, I believe, but honestly I dont know for sure) and I myself had my identity stolen being what, I thought, was super vigilant with personal info online. All of these things coupled with natural paranoia and fear of the unknown in tor has me wanting to be most careful. I've read about opening documents in tor and whatnot, so I understand the risk of pdf files and whatnot.

If you could give any insight, you'd be a really nice person for helping a clueless guy out with your time. Thanks for reading.

**tl;dr- article says super anonymity can be had via using virtualbox and VMs with TBB; one VM with damn small linux as firewall, the other with ubuntu (saved in a truecrypt hidden volume, saved on removable media) as primary VM, running through tor/the firewall to browse.**

I've been using the Vidalia Bundle with my Firefox for quite a while, and everything has been going quite well.

After a couple failed attempts it asked if I wanted to restart in safe mode, or reset firefox. I went ahead and started it in safe mode. Through trial and error I determined that it was Tor that was suddenly causing Firefox not to work. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it multiple times, as well as removing both the Https Everywhere and User-script and trying to uninstall/reinstall it then. Unfortunately, nothing is working.

1. Install a base OS (Linux) with full-disk encryption.
2. Install VirtualBox or some other VM app.
3. Set up the VM to route entirely through Tor. (See [this tutorial](http://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-set-up-a-tor-middlebox-routing-all-virtualbox-virtual-machine-traffic-over-the-tor-network) for how this can be done.)
4. Set the system up to automatically boot the VM, full-screen, to act as the primary OS on the machine.

I've been considering this for a while, and I know for a fact that the military uses a similar concept on their own systems. When booting a military computer, they have a base OS load, which then decrypts the inner OS (Windows, typically), which then takes over operation of the computer from that point forward.

The difference here is that not only would the system be entirely encrypted, but every single network connection you make would be routed transparently through Tor. Theoretically you could use any OS in the VM.

Does anyone know how this could be done? Is there some software that might make this simple? I understand that this would very likely make the computer incredibly slow, but if the goal was security and anonymity, speed is less important.

Thoughts?


--------------
**Edit:** I've been considering some possibilities here. I guess the primary question is this: Is there a way to boot a graphical VM from the command line, without necessarily starting a GUI in the host operating system? If not, what would be the fastest way to get a GUI up in the host OS, with the sole purpose of displaying the VM?

The way I see it, the host could boot quickly into a console (no GUI), where you could log in using a username and password. If you wanted to update or tweak the host OS, you could log in as root. If you wanted to boot the VM, you could log in using the VM-specific login, which would automatically start the GUI and run the VM. Once the VM was shut down, the system could automatically shut down the host OS.

* As I won't be doing anything in particular that might benefit from anonymity, what benefit is there in using Tor? I'll continue using my personal Gmail account that is just my name, continue using GitHub, and so on. Does using Tor help me at all in regards to PRISM or other NSA surveillance activities? What about privacy from advertisers? As I understand it, PRISM goes to the companies to ask for (meta)data rather than just sniffing traffic, so does Tor help me out at all?

* Conversely, is there anything I should be careful with? Do I have to worry about exit node operators sniffing my email contents even if I use HTTPS? Is there any information in particular I should be careful about spreading through Tor as opposed to through clearnet? I think I'll continue banking through clearnet just in case.

* If there are a few sites I would prefer to use through clearnet, like the aforementioned banking, would using FoxyProxy be a safe way to specify those exceptions? I understand specifying the correct ruleset may require more than just listing the domain name of the site, but if I manage to do that correctly is this a safe option?

First attempted use of this new knowledge: creating a reddit account that is only accessed through TOR. (This is not it, for reasons detailed below.) I've found a host of issues, please bear with this long post.


I've logged in to hidden services fine. However, creating the reddit account required allowing a couple scripts for the captcha (any problem there?).
Logging in required allowing some more scripts and allowing reddit.com cookies. Before doing that I either could not log in, or the login would not last for more than one page--I'd be prompted to login before creating this post. I still forbid things I think are ads (adzerk and anything from google).


First: anybody else have similar experiences loggin in to reddit through Tor? Is there a better way/what should I do for less trusted clearnet websites?


Second: even though I allow reddit.com, redditstatic.com, &amp;s3.amazonaws.com scripts, when I click the link to create a text post I can't navigate from the link post form to the text post form. I see javascript:void(0) at the bottom when hovering, as I see when not using Tor. What's the issue? 


Extra info: running latest Tor bundle, have it set up as a bridge relay. Can that be a contributing factor? Should I not be doing so if I'm just starting out?


Also, I'm posting from a trackable account now, because even after relaxing so many permissions I still couldn't submit the post. I didn't want to compromise that account by allowing adzerk or Google API, but it seems I would have to. I can't think of what else is different between my Safari session and the Tor session.

I know that it's not safe to open documents/pdfs while you're still connected to the internet, but I'm assuming it's fine to save them?

~~I created the virtual machine with Ubuntu, is that a fine OS to use, or should I have gone with something else?~~

Some highlights

""...identity leaks at the application level can be exploited by adversaries to reveal Tor users identity. Indeed, Tor does not cipher data streams end-to-end, but from the source to a Tor exit node. Then, streams from the Tor exit node to the destinations are in plain text (if the application layer does not encrypt the data). Therefore, it is possible to analyze the data stream seeking for identity leaks at the application level.""

""P2P applications and more specifically BitTorrent, an application that is being daily used by millions of users have been so far neglected and excluded from anonymizing studies. The crux of the problem is that BitTorrent easily allows any adversary to retrieve users’ IP addresses from the tracker for torrents they are participating to.""

I'm seriously considering setting up a VPS for myself. I plan to use it for SVN/GIT server, personal ""cloud"" storage, maybe run a few research projects on it, stuff like that. Most likely Ubuntu or a similar flavor of Linux. I'm leaning towards [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) because I've heard great things about it and it's reasonably priced. I'm open to other services, but the availability, integrity, and robustness is extremely important because I'll be keeping school, work, and research information on it.

Since it will be up and running 24/7, I'd like to run a Tor relay on it. The problem is, I have a bunch of questions that I don't know the answers for. This is where I need your help :

1) Are there any VPS hosting services that I should stay away from (i.e. Terms/Service prohibit Tor Relays)?

2) What type of Relay would be most advantageous to the network? I'm leaning toward Exit Node.

3) Is there a way to make sure that I don't run over my bandwidth limit? [Tor Cloud](https://cloud.torproject.org/) has a way to cap the bandwidth, but it's for Bridges. I don't really want to shut the relay down when I start getting close to the limit. What I'd like is some way to gradually decrease the bandwidth as it gets closer to my limit.

4) Are there any security considerations from having my personal stuff on the server too? For instance, would it be better to just get a crappy VPS for the sole purpose of running the Relay like [BurstNet](https://www.burst.net/linvps.shtml).

5) Are there any ""strange"" things that I may not have thought about?

Thanks everyone. Looking forward to hearing what everyone has to say.

A major Dutch ISP was recently forced to block this site on both the DNS and the IP level.

SOPA may be defeated for now, but it may be only a question of time until the U.S. introduces DNS-blocking based on lists dictated by industry. Spain recently passed such a law, as far as I understand. Belgium, Denmark, and Ireland, all block The Pirate Bay.

I worry that the internet will become increasingly fragmented: if you're in the Netherlands, you can visit one set of websites, and if you're in a different country you can visit another set of websites, and although the overlap may be huge, different sites are blocked in different countries.

I wonder if Tor (as an exit network) will become decreasingly useful for visiting sites disliked by the establishment as this proceeds. Soon I may get a Dutch explanation that the site has been blocked, instead of The Pirate Bay. Then I have to wait a good while until my Tor client picks a different exit, and hope that one is on a non-censored ISP. It may become a very frustrating experience.

People who run exit nodes on censored ISPs could put the blocked sites into their exit policies as exclusions, but these lists have to come from somewhere and have to be maintained, which gets harder as more and more sites are blocked.

Any thoughts on this? Is there something I have overlooked? Am I overreacting?

I've been playing around on Tor recently.  Specifically I'm running off a Tails bootable USB drive.

I was recently made aware of www.dnsleaktest.com  -  where you can run a test to see who's ""watching"" you.  The website says: ""This page shows the DNS servers that your computer is using to resolve DNS names. The owners of the servers listed below have the ability to log the names of all websites you connect to.""

When I run this test on the clearnet, I get only 2 servers, both of which are from my Verizon ISP.  That makes sense.

When I'm running Tor through Tails, though, I have a list of between 4 and 6 servers, ranging from random IP's in Sweden, to M.I.T. IP's in the USA.  They seem random, but I've seen a few labeled ""Google"" in various countries, including the USA (where I am).

Is this something that I should be worried about?  Are those DNS servers actually able to track what I'm doing, despite the whole idea of anonymity on Tor?  

Any help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

Until last week, they both worked at relatively the same speed. Downloading a small file, like, say, the Firefox setup, or even the TOR browser bundle went over smoothly at 80 kbps or so. Starting this week, however, speeds have gone down drastically at home, including regular browsing speeds via TOR. Roughly 10 kbps. Downloading outside of TOR isn't affected--I get the speeds I always get. 

I've tried to check at regular intervals to make sure I'm not just getting stuck with slow relays/exits. I've stopped running the home connection as a relay to rule that out temporarily.

What could be causing it? Is it a sudden influx of congestion/activity in the TOR network at the time I usually browse from home (ie, right about now)?

TOR/Vidalia is updated to the latest version, and again, it works more or less the same at work (ie, fast enough), but at home TOR transfers specifically have slowed down since Sunday. Normal https/http transfers outside TOR go on at usual speeds. What could it be?

---

Update: About a week later, and things are still pretty slow. Likewise, things are still pretty fast at work. I've tried running things on another computer, to ensure there isn't something wrong with the computer itself (something else hogging bandwidth). Vidalia's bandwidth graph more or less agrees with the speeds I'm getting, so I doubt it's something else that's chewing up all the Tor bandwidth on my computer itself.

as I have 100/100 unlimited connection I decided to set up a relay but I still have no idea if I'm doing it right. I looked through numerous tutorials/how-tos but they all seem a little bit outdated.

Can someone please explain me the difference? Do I understand it correctly when I say non-exit relay means I will switch traffic inside TOR network, that means only traffic directed for example between TOR users / onions - websites; and exit relay routes traffic from outside TOR to the TOR network? If so, which one should I use - which one does TOR needs more?

My next question is - I'm having my exit relay turned on for 2 days and traffic is always 0KB/s. Also when I check the network map - my relay is not listed in the list. Checking the Message Log it says my relay is up and working ([po 22. 7 11:49:47 2013] Your Relay is Online - Your relay is now online and available for Tor clients to use.

I want to do my part and run a non-exit relay. My issue is that Tor seems to be transferring data at a maximum of 100 - 300 KB/s (looking at the recv/send lines in Vidalia's Bandwidth Usage window), which is more than an order of magnitude lower than the average and maximum values I set in Vidalia (average set to 10240 KB/s for example). The total amount of data transferred over the last 2 days is consistent with an average speed of 50 KB/s.

I am on a fiber internet connection and I have transferred data at several MB/s before, so I am not sure why Tor isn't using more of my bandwidth. It is unlikely that I am being firewalled on the ports that I'm using.

Tor's uptime is now more than 2 days, so I don't think it's as simple as waiting for the directory to be updated.

* Paying for access to a privacy respecting RSS web site (which?), with Bitcoins, and accessing it through TBB.
* Code a plug-in or mod for Liferea so that it runs everything over Tor. (Or maybe there's some Tor tool to force Liferea to run over Tor? My concern there would be that although my IP address becomes anonymized that Liferea might still be sending non-anonymized content over Tor.)

**edit** I got it to work, I feel like an idiot.  In case anyone else ever has this problem- what worked for me was a combination of the advice about putting it on my desktop, clicking the button about firewalls in networking (look to comments), and- opening a Firefox browser.  Once I opened the FF browser (I've been on chrome lately) it opened right up and started it's own browser.  I never thought to have FF open initially because from what I read it had said that it will install and open it's own version.  

Soooo yeah anyway thanks for the help guys, I'm retarded, and the silk road is gorgeous.

The problem I have is this - If I open Orweb and do a check, it appears that I am correctly connected to the TOR network, but in Orweb, if the first site I try to connect to is Google, for example, it gives me Google Germany, or Google Netherlands, or even Google Romania, but  it won't give me Google USA. I am in the USA.

If I choose to go to a site like reddit after the Tor check and then enter google.com from reddit,  then I can get to Google USA.

Is there some setting that I need in order to convince Orweb it should go to the USA site? This didn't happen when I was running Orbot and Orweb on my rooted HC before the upgrade to ICS.

Once or twice I downloaded somewhat large (copyrighted)files through the browser, maybe 300mb or so(big guilt). I cannot claim complete ignorance to the good use of tor and it's purpose, but I guess i thought a little usage here and there wouldn't really hurt the network. However i guess the guilt built up and i stopped using it and forgot about it.

However seeing news stories lately about tor and it's importance in the arab spring, syria, snowden and so on, it really started getting to me that I really misused tor, and for the last weeks i've been feeling like the biggest scum in the world. To have done something wrong, possibly harming others, I never wanted to be such a person... I don't want pity, I'm feeling suicidal. So I want to help, but first i have some questions regarding my guilt:

1.) How overloaded is the tor network really, is it always at max use? checking torstatus.blutmagie.de most servers don't seem to be hitting their max bandwith, or am I misunderstanding?

2.) Have i hindered or slowed down freedom? maybe my stupid browsing or one of the times I downloaded slowed down the network enough that syrian rebels didn't get a message in time and got killed? Maybe that's a longshot, but the possibility of being partly responsible for something like that... I don't think i can live with it.

3.) If i'm getting good speeds(say over 100kb/S), doesn't that mean the server is not being used a lot at the moment and my use isn't really hurting others? Or how is bandwidth divided between users? 

4.) Has any exit node user ever been jailed for someone downloading throught it? 


So that's my guilt, the damage is done. Maybe i should be hanged, but I want to try and help:

What's the best way as a home user to help? I want to help people in oppressed countries particularly, but too much of a coward to run an exit node. It seems running a ""middle-man"" relay would be best or an obfuscated bridge, however:

1.) If i'm running an obfuscated bridge/relay could anyone find out I'm the one behind it? I often travel through china and wouldn't want to be detained.  Could i get in trouble any other way? 

2.) If i use torcloud would people know I'm behind it? Would amazon give out my name if China or Iran asked? Can i use an amazon server without giving my name? 

3.) Do obfuscated bridges run independently of normal exit nodes? As in not affected by their use?

4.) Any way to specifically help pro-democracy movements in opressed countries with a tor connection?

5.) What are some good servers i can donate to?

http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/

&gt;Let's suppose that there is an .avi video file stored on a TrueCrypt volume (therefore, the video file is entirely encrypted). The user provides the correct password (and/or keyfile) and mounts (opens) the TrueCrypt volume. When the user double clicks the icon of the video file, the operating system launches the application associated with the file type – typically a media player. The media player then begins loading a small initial portion of the video file from the TrueCrypt-encrypted volume to RAM (memory) in order to play it. While the portion is being loaded, TrueCrypt is automatically decrypting it (in RAM). The decrypted portion of the video (stored in RAM) is then played by the media player. While this portion is being played, the media player begins loading another small portion of the video file from the TrueCrypt-encrypted volume to RAM (memory) and the process repeats. This process is called on-the-fly encryption/decryption and it works for all file types (not only for video files).

However, I've read that the level of anonymity depends to some extent on looking as much like the other Tor users as possible. But I like NoScript, which is disabled by default on the Tor browser bundle.

My question is: by enabling NoScript, am I losing some degree of anonymity?

I checked my browser fingerprint on EFF's panopticlick: https://panopticlick.eff.org/. Without Tor it's about 17 bits, with Tor on factory settings it's about 16 bits, and for Tor with NoScript enabled it's about 10 bits. This suggests it would be better to enable NoScript, right?

EDIT

see this link for why disabling javascript compromises anonymity: https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBJavaScriptEnabled

see this link for why EFF's panopticlick doesn't calculate your tor fingerprint so well: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/effs-panopticlick-and-torbutton

The internet is too full of assholes to allow things like Tor to be unbanned.

Oh and this CAPTCHA is a fucking joke. 4chan's is orders of magnitude more difficult, and anyone who's posted there for more than a week could easily just queue up several dozen reddit captcha's and type them out in a minute. Doesn't slow spam down much at all. Hell, i bet a computer could guess it more than half the time as is.

Oh this ""you're doing this too much"" thing is somewhat annoying -- i bet this is something that goes away after you're a ""full fledged redditor"" but it would be trivial to switch exit nodes and use a new account to get past those time limits.


sorry if it's a bit shitposty - i copied it from ask reddit where i expect zero replies.  but seriously?  tor exit nodes produce the worst shitposters and spammers you can imagine.

I have the Tor Browser set to boot at startup, and it's been working fine for a solid month (with Vidalia always appearing and connecting to Tor before the browser window pops up.

Earlier today, I was going to do something in my torrc file (working on routing and IRC through it).  I opened it up in Nano via command line, but I didn't do anything (hell, I think I even got the wrong destination because there was nothing displaying in the terminal).  I closed out the Terminal without saving (because I hadn't done anything) and proceeded to open it in an actual text editor (this time, there was text).  I didn't end up doing anything to the torrc file in the text editor either and closed it without saving.  Idk if any of that is important, but I did all of this before the problem started appearing.

Anyways, I started up my browser later and Vidalia didn't appear.  I thought this was curious because, usually, Vidalia's the first thing to appear.  I waited a bit to see if it would come up, but there pops up the Tor Browser window in its stead.  The browser appears to be routing through Tor too, is the weird thing.  I went and checked my System Monitor and there's Vidalia -- running in the background, apparently -- and Tor seems to be running too.

I'm not sure what exactly happened, but I restarted my computer a handful of times and Vidalia refuses to open.  I don't know how to troubleshoot it any further.  It's running and everything, and (hopefully) the Tor Browser is running correctly, but I'd be far more comfortable if I had Vidalia open and running.

The place I work at uses a proxy to let us access the internet. So, I'd got the IP that shows up in the login windows (everytime you open an connection the auth window show up), and added it to the network settings (port and and login/pw aswell). But that wasnt enough.

Everytime I try to open TOR, it stucks at 10% (establishing an encrypted...). I tried adding bridges, changing the proxy type, but there's no way I can get past this part.

EDIT:
If anyone is interested, I found a solution to my problem, instead of trying to deal with SOCKS in .net, I setup Polipo which is a proxy that can interface between TOR (SOCKS5) and a regular HTTP request over TCP. Once you've setup and have Polipo running you just redirect all your requests through that, Polipo however needs to know in turn to route traffic through TOR which means you specify a SOCKS proxy for it in the configuration file i.e.
socksParentProxy = localhost:9050

1. Install [Advanced Onion Router](http://sourceforge.net/projects/advtor/)  
2. Install [Proxy Switch](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caehdcpeofiiigpdhbabniblemipncjj)

4. Under the Proxy Profiles tab, rename your profile, select manual configuration, enter HTTP Proxy 127.0.0.1 Port 9050, and check ""Use the same proxy server for all protocols"". Save.   
5. Under the General tab, check the Quick Switch box, select Binary Switch, under Profile 1 select [Direct Connection] and under Profile 2 select your TOR profile. Save.

So just acting like tor, the ISP does not know where the data originated, and the nodes dont know either.  This way if the ISP is Forced to maintain logs, they can say ""we dont know where the traffic originated.""   

* Problems I See:
* High Overhead, this could be mitigated with more people using the service
* startup costs ..its just a dream anyway
* I've misunderstood tor completely (very likely)

And read:  
http://cvo-lab.blogspot.com/  
  
The attack described can be summarized as follows (Please correct me if I am wrong): An attacker either infects a few tor relays (minimum 3) or controls them. The attacker then modifies the IV in memory (using a malware/rootkit) in order to weaken the session key and make it predictable. The attacker will then have to force the tor client to use the infected tor relays as the 3-node circuit, in order for the attack to be effective.  
  
Is this threat conceptual only? I mean, imo, it is NOT very difficult to infect Tor relays running on an un-patched windows machine with the malware. However, the really difficult task is forcing the tor client to pick the 3 infected nodes as the circuit. BUT if you were CHINA/IRAN, you can simply block all access to all relays/bridges except for the infected ones.  
  
So, is this attack feasible?  
  
Also, the blog indicated that the source code will be published on the 11th of Nov, 2011, unless the Tor foundation says otherwise. It doesn't appear that they have published the source code. So, did the Tor guys realize that this is a real security issue and thus asked Eric not to publish anything?  
  
Anyone here has the full story?  
  
EDIT:  
The attack described will be very difficult for individuals to carry-out, because of the fact that you need to force the client to establish a circuit using the infected relay points only and somehow eliminate all other options. However, if the adversary is a country (china/Iran) and they have full control over which tor relays the client can connect to, then this attack becomes very feasible, real and dangerous.",,False,self,t5_2r36m,True,,,True,t3_p07jk,http://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/p07jk/what_has_become_of_the_tor_weakness_that_was/,

This opened Vidalia, and once Vidalia loaded completely, it automatically opened the Browser with noscript.  Not sure if it is cool to dock Vidalia by itself, because Vidalia doesn't always open the browser automatically when docked, but it seems that if I stop Tor, then restart it from the control panel, the Tor browser opens automatically again.",,False,self,t5_2r36m,1375648079.0,,,True,t3_1jozkr,http://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/1jozkr/why_is_tor_suddenly_using_firefox_and_not_that/,

Of course we're fully aware that Tails is free and available for anyone to install on their own, but for some people the technical barrier is too high.  We're hoping to help them stay safe.

If we determine that there is any demand for a service such as this, we're going to add more options for larger drives, automatic update subscriptions (a new thumb drive every month), technical support, and Bitcoin payment.  Please let us know any ways you think we can improve this service.",,False,self,t5_2r36m,False,,,True,t3_1gdti9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/1gdti9/linux_live_usb_thumb_drives_preconfigured_for_tor/,

They left no trace except for an accidental sticker and break where they entered. Oh, someone also smashed up my backup drive to be a jackass. I have a crappy recording of the entire thing they left on my voicemail. It's a terrible quality recording of them going through my things. I was called with this recording and the next day a second one with juvenile threats saying, ""they knew where I lived"" and they would ""come to get me"". They mention me by name and describe where I like to take my walks, etc. This is some crazy stuff. It has to be related to this Tor stuff since I ran a half dozen relays, bridges, and such.

I have the original barely audible recordings if anyone is interested - it's pretty interesting stuff if you know how to use an audio forensics package or even Audacity. Now, even weirder. My cellphone - all of a sudden - is assigned and will only connect through 22.248.98.0 - which is DoD.
