Between economic issues, distrust of government, the NSA scandal, drone strikes, it seems like the American Government has gone haywire. Our own country is quickly beginning to resemble the ""evil dictatorships"" we've been told to fight and hate in the Middle East and Africa since I was a child. If things continue like this, I find the prospect of raising a family here to be terrifying.

However, I'm only 27 years old. My worldview is limited by age, and influenced by content and news sources that were impossible to imagine 30 years ago. Social media and 24-hour internet coverage are displaying things that would never have gone mainstream in the past.

So here is my general question: Are things really getting worse?

I see a few possibilities.

A. America is really devolving, and the government is getting more oppressive than it has ever been before. The media is portraying an accurate representation of our current status as a country.

B. Things are no worse than they have ever been, we are just more aware of those faults due to the 24-hour news cycle. I am personally more concerned because I am at an age where I am more interested in reading those news stories, where I wouldn't have noticed them 10 or 15 years ago.

C. The country is actually better than it has historically been, and our consumption of the media is simply skewing the facts - Or we are making big issues out of standard government corruption that has always been present in the background.

I'm hoping there are users here with a better concept of the big picture that can explain why things seem so tense and extreme today.

EDIT, for the sake of clarification:

I am operating under the assumption that increasing domestic surveillance is 'worse.' The NSA scandal, and the use of surveillance techniques like internet spying and drone use are not things a young American would expect (or want) to see from their government. What I am basically asking is, ""should we be angry that these things are coming to light?""

I'm in Texas's HD136, currently served by TX Rep. Tony Dale (R).  

I don't dislike the fellow, though obviously we disagree on many issues.  I have no animosity towards him.  That said, I'd rather a Democrat was in the position. 

Next Wednesday, I'm thinking about throwing my hat into the ring for the Democratic Primary for HD136.  

There's a couple reasons for doing this:

1) I want HD136 to be competitive, and a primary competition will allow the eventual winner (who will in all likelihood, not be me), to have better name recognition, and get his name out there.  

2) I want to raise awareness of proportional representation though the [Single Transferable Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote), with the hope that whoever wins, we can put together an STV proposal for the 2015 legislature session.  Hopefully, we can have a referendum in 2018, and if that passes, use Single Transferable Vote in 2020, after the census.  

The reason for this latter is that throughout Texas's history, we've been gerrymandered by both parties.  STV decreases the importance of where district lines are drawn, so it will allow for decreased gerrymandering and, for other reasons too lengthy to go into here, I believe that PR systems like STV provide a disincentive for corruption that our current system lacks.  

3) I have been diagnosed with High Functioning Autism (I'm certainly somewhere on the ""spectrum.""); I want to raise awareness that ""autistic kids"" eventually become autistic adults - that we may be a little strange and quirky, but that we're just as capable as anyone else and that we can bring new and unique perspectives to areas where you don't normally think of us, including in government.  

If I win the primary, (which will only happen if I am unopposed) my intention is to run a bit of a ""man-bites-dog"" unusual campaign.  If done right, it'll be ""interesting"" (in an otherwise uninteresting news cycle) without delving into ""ridiculous.""  

Because of gerrymandering, the incumbent will almost certainly win. I just want to raise awareness of my issues. 

I'm looking for any advice on the topic.

Is there a much more thorough response to this that I'm not aware of? If not, I'm assuming that pressing forward, despite the blaring fallacies, means there is an ulterior motive. If the entire argument does center around simply making it more difficulty to get a hold of these weapons (and accessories), then what's the justification for limiting tens of millions of law-abiding citizens' access to said weapons/accessories?

1369946665.0,43,self.Ask_Politics,1fcz79,Medical Insurance rates on our existing provider going up 40% blamed on ObamaCare. Why? How?,oldandgeeky,50,7,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1fcz79/medical_insurance_rates_on_our_existing_provider/,"I'm on the management team of a small business of ~40 employees.  We just had a meeting with our insurance broker and he gave us the rates for next year.  In average, they are increasing 40% across the board, in the PPO Family plan I have is going up 47%!  We looked at other providers and they are all planning similar increases.  

Right now, we provide health insurance to all employees who work over 37.5 hours and have been employed over 90 days.  We pay the single individual premiums in full.  So if you are a young, single employee, you pay nothing for the lowest tier of health insurance.  It's a pretty standard managed care HMO plan and almost all employees are covered minus a few that opt out for whatever reason (spouse or parent coverage usually).

However, the increase in premiums is going to make this impossible.  We had a what we thought was a major increase of 25% last year.  At that point we took a poll across our workers.  Most of the employees (first job out of college 20-somethings) were going to drop the insurance if we didn't pay for it.  When we ran those number, it dropped us into a smaller pool size and was going to increase our rates for the remaining staff almost 50%.  We wanted to provide health benefits so we covered the increase for insurance.  All in all, with a decrease in sales and this increased cost, we ran a small loss last year.

Now, we are having a better year and will make a profit but now we have this staring at us.  We actually tried to plan a similar increase as this year into next years budget but this increase is well into six figures and a cost cut or a new sale or two will not cover it.  

Is this happening to most plans?  I heard increases were coming due to the added of costs from the removal of per-existing conditions and caps but this seems excessive.  I thought that the mandate was going to absorb some of this increased cost.  

We're at a loss of what to do, we're thinking about options of just providing raises equal to the current plan and not providing insurance.  We talked about increasing our contribution by the same amount we were planning and passing the rest on but then we have to deal with the employee fallout and a possible even greater increase or being dropped completely from the plan.  Do the employees have to buy insurance if we offer it?  I know when I looked a few years ago that individual policies are outrageous compared to group; are these rates going to skyrocket as well?  If that's the case, the raise plan is a joke.  There doesn't seem to be a good option.  We talked about a small layoff but we don't have enough staff as it is to grow like we want. The original plan was to hire 4-6 next year.

So as a under 50 person company, how can provide health insurance at rates that are attractive to employees yet make financial sense to the company?  I'm looking for the Affordable in the Affordable Care Act.  I also looking at myself, I have a special needs kid that runs high bills and we spend $14K out of pocket for his medical costs now.  Increasing the premiums for my plan will add almost another $5K on top of that not to mention we have a $2000 individual deducible.   So that will make my out-of-pocket for the whole family over $30,000 a year!   This is almost double what I pay a year in mortgage and escrow.  

**tl;dr Small Business health insurance rates are increasing 40%, company can't afford it and neither can the employees, what can we do? Why is this happening?**

**Edit 5/31 10:50am**
   We're in Georgia.  The average employee salary is around $39K.  
   So it sounding like we're truly in a rock and a hard place situation.  I did some Googling last night and it sound like the exchanges are not operational until October and they might miss that date.  That doesn't leave us much of a window.  If we don't see what the exchange options are until November and we need sign to renew in December.   I do understand the cynicism but we really are trying to figure out a real solution.  We do believe our employees deserve insurance and want to provide it to them.  We're open to compensating them to purchase an individual plan or a group plan.  We just need to do it where health insurance doesn't become our third largest expense in the company eroding our ability to grow or even in most scenarios not lose money.      

   I also see that the Marketplace, which will allow individuals to buy individual insurance at the corporate rates doesn't hit until 2015.  Looking the current individual rates for my family right now are almost double what I pay now, and if they go up like our group rates next year that would be impossible. 

   Wow, this is a real mess, I thought I was was missing something.  I am going to write up this post in a better format and send it to my rep, not that I really expect much of a response.  My experiences of writing to my Congressman has been a series of well-crafted form letter responses.

Edit: 06/07/13 (GMT+09:30) Adelaide.

Here's what I have deigned from this discussion. ""Liberty too must be limited in order to be possessed"" - Edmund Burke, I never quite understood that until now. The nature of a majority rules party will always force several things to happen, any party will always try to sway public opinion in whatever manner possible. Secondly (I don't like it but it works in a way) democratic rights are limited in the United States particularly so the peoples vote has less power, this is because the people are too easily swayed by too many factors to be relied upon to elect an effective ruling party. PoliSciUgGuy explains the premise better and has provided a link http://www.volokh.com/2013/07/05/restricting-democracy-in-order-to-protect-other-liberal-values/. Thirdly the fact that the people's power is limited leaves government more susceptible to other forms of manipulation the most evident being big business, however this is preferable to many other possible influencing factors because this particular influence relies largely upon the approval of the product and in a less direct way is also subject to public opinion. This seems to create a triumvirate where the people have as much power as anywhere else but are often unaware, I think perhaps the only thing required to make the system more viable is to make them more aware of exactly what factors influence their government and then they can also willfully regulate them.

Further down the story, we get this anecdote:

&gt;Justina Collins says her daughter Nybria, now 15, has always struggled with reading. The single mother knew something was wrong when Nybria aced her standardized test in reading.  ""Could someone explain to me how she could have passed or exceed a test, but fail throughout the whole entire year? ... When you hear it coming from the very ones that you look up to, to help educate your children, it's just sad and hurtful to know that we search and hope for the best for our kids, and that's what their oath is to provide the best education for them,"" Collins said.  Nybria is now a ninth grader reading at a fifth-grade level. 

Some level of standardized testing will be required, although I think in this case another portion of the article makes clear why this happened:

&gt;Beverly Hall is Atlanta's retired school superintendent. Her system's turnaround won her national fame, awards, and more than **$500,000 in performance bonuses.**

Yeah, that's a pretty good reason to cheat.

To me, I think this shows that unless we have the *controls* in place to handle standardized testing, that test is going to fairly worthless.  Texas, of all places, seems to understand this.  They suspended a student for [four days for tweeting part of the STAAR (State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness) test](http://www.kens5.com/news/Texas-student-suspended-after-tweeting-STAAR-test-photo-201024071.html).  The mother, it seems though, doesn't get it.

&gt;Kyron's mom, Kiana Daw, said the tweet didn't reveal any questions or answers.  ""I think it's excessive punishment,"" she said. ""That's the type of punishment you should get for something really severe.""

Except that he could have easily have taken a picture of the actual questions.  Those questions not being known means that the test is ""fair"" to all takers in that no one has an advantage in knowing it beforehand.

It all leads back to something that I don't know is really possible:

Its become a topic at work and I found out another of my employees was accused similarly when she was in college (tinfoil theory: is it a female manipulation thing?) and the debate revolved around whether it was reasonable that she knew a theory before the class or not.

Again, she could have no one else with her at the meetings and she was not able to bring in evidence on her behalf from one of her professors from her undergrad work where she claimed to have learned it from.

Most of those theories involve a conspiratorial worldview that I discount as illogical, but listening to our current crop of congressmen and news shows has me wondering if a surveillance state couldn't be born out of more organic (unplanned) forces.

The more I think about it, and the more I talk with younger voters (people for whom things like the TSA, War on Terror, warrant-less wiretapping and due process aren't bothersome because they have always 'been' for them), the more I wonder if political and social momentum might simply lead in that direction withing a generation or so. 

Our cultural norms regarding privacy and state/citizen relationships are certainly shifting, and it doesn't seem like such a leap to suppose that the social and legal precedents we've been setting for the last 12 years might be leading down an oddball path.  The ongoing efforts to monitor/regulate the internet by both private and public interests (again, not for evil conspiratorial purposes, but rather for perceived security threats and profitability) is also leading down a somewhat foggy path.

I'm by no means a Republican myself and my partial affiliation (fiscal conservative, socially liberal) will never be more than a wrench in the system.  However, to protect us from the excesses of single party rule, we need at least two functioning parties.  Whether the party reemerges as the Republicans or Conservatives or the Kangaroos, I think we can all agree that if our politics become an echo chamber, we're in trouble.*

I've been defending the Republican party as merely a repeat of what the Democrats went through in 2004 after a painful and truly embarrassing defeat in the Presidential race.  Democrats, I think, got lucky that the war got so unpopular that they were able to recover quickly (I think they have their own problems, but power solves a lot...), but I don't see the Republicans getting that wave again in 2014.  I believe they will hold the House, but they won't take the Senate.  2016 might be a repeat of their 2012 horror if Hillary is sufficiently rehabilitated by then as I don't see a Republican that might be able to challenge her and the Democrat's resources.

I believe further, the problem with Republican's isn't entirely their message, but rather that their leadership is, frankly, moronic.  I'll just take this sequester as an example, using it to writ large.

* Obama has been saying that the sequester is a bad idea, will hurt the country, and wants it removed.
* Boehner replied in this [WSJ Op-Ed (might hit a paywall)](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323495104578314240032274944.html) that this was Obama's fault, the sequester is a bad idea, and we need to replace those cuts.

Stop and look at that - Boehner just agreed with 90% of Obama's premise!  So now he gives Obama the opening and loses much of his position; Obama can merely say that Boehner is willing to damage the country if he can't get differing cuts... and then fall back into the class warfare that Boehner wants to cut Medicare and Social Security, even if Boehner doesn't; strawmen arguments haven't hurt the President yet.

I think the problem Republicans are facing is a matter of leadership, not necessarily division.  Boehner seems to move between capitulation (pissing off the conservative base) and resistance (pissing off the ""Establishment"" or ""RINO"" base), in the process proving himself to do nothing but exacerbate the problems within the party.

It is my opinion that if the Republicans could select a leader who would do one or the other, rather than vacillate, they would see their chances improve dramatically.  Think about the perception of it - one moment they are intractible and do-nothing, the next they are trying to compromise and settle.  Their own bases don't know which Republicans are going to show up and what principles they will sell out this time.  The fact that they don't seem to have a lick of political logic doesn't help either, as I pointed out above.

If you're a voter, would you trust a party that seems to be operating like this?  To me, whatever party is going to replace the Republican party (even if it is itself) simply has to stick to a position and go with it, pieces fall where they may.  I think, further, it might well take three or four cycles for Republicans to get to this point, not necessarily purges but rather for the public outside of its base to trust it enough to get back the White House.

There are a few points I would like to make to hopefully educate some of those that are unfamiliar with small-arms history. 

* **An overview and timeline of how modern firearms have developed.**


* **The United States has a history of modern firearms readily available to civilians.**


 **Overview of Small-arms Development since 1770**

**1775-ish**
The Continental Army was armed with a hodge-podge of rifles and muskets in 1775. The difference between the two was that a musket consisted of a tube (barrel) that took a loosely fitting ball and fired it innaccurately, but good enough to hit a formation of men at close range; A rifle had a barrel that took a tightly fitting ball, and there were grooves cut into the barrel to make the ball spin (rifling, where the term 'rifle' comes from). The rifle was more accurate than the musket, and allowed rifleman to target individual soldiers or officers with a reasonable degree of sucess; However, it was faster to load and fire a smoothbore musket, and could be fired for a longer period of time in a prolonged battle. (Blackpowder leaves a residue in the barrel that would build up in rifles/muskets, and make it difficult to stuff the ball down the barrel.) Basically, a rifle was more useful at longer distances, and in short engagements; but if you were going to stick around and duke it out, you would have probably been better off with a musket.

**Civil War**
Let's fast-forward to the American Civil War. There are a few things we need to cover. The [Minie Ball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minie_Ball), the [percussion cap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_Cap), [metal cartridges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartridge_(firearms)), [repeating rifles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_repeating_rifle), and [revolving pistols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver).

The Minie Ball was a football shaped projectile that worked very well in rifles, and dramatically increased the range and accuracy of rifle fire. The percussion cap allowed firearms to be fired more quickly, more accurately, and in any weather. Percusion caps provided much more instaneous ignition of the black-powder, and did away with the very large flash-fire that was near a persons eye when they were firing. Accurate rifle fire was now posible out to 1000 yards, and ""sharpshooting"" began to take much more notoriety during the Civil War.

Metal cartidges allowed firearms to be loaded even quicker than muzzle-loading rifles, and they were also more reliable, and safer. In the heat of combat, it was not uncommon for a solider to forget to remove the old percussion cap on the nipple of his rifle, and put a new one on; as a result, a soldier would put new powder and bullet on top of the old one, and if they did this a few times, and then remembered to put a cap on, it could blow the rifle up! Metal cartridges and single-shot rifles simplified the loading process to simply putting a cartridge in, cocking the hammer, and pulling the trigger. Another advantage that metal cartidge cases provides was allowing the soldier to load and fire from a prone (laying down) position instead of kneeling or standing to load the rifle; it may not seem like much, but a soldier that is lying down is a much harder target to hit than one that is standing up.

Repeating rifles like the Spencer rifle (the one in the link) allowed soldiers to fire more shots before having to reload, and further increased the firepower at the disposal of a solider. The same can be said for revolvers. A group of Calvary soldiers with repeating rifles, and revolvers would have been a true force multiplier; A spencer carbine allowed soldiers to shoot 7 shots, and a revolver would have given him another 6 (or 12 if he had two), as well as a saber that was effective at close range or off horseback. With this kind of firepower at their disposal, a calvary unit could flank, and quickly subdue a much larger fighting force armed with muzzle loading rifles.

Following the Civil War, single-shot and repeating rifles took divergent paths; single-shot rifles were designed for fire larger bullets with more blackpowder behind them to be effective at longer ranges, while repeating rifles focused on smaller bullets and less powder so that more could be fitted into the magazine. Just like difference between rifles and muskets in the Revolutionary War, the utility of each was dependent upon the situation; one of the many reasons that Custer was over-run at the Battle of the Little Big Horn was because the Sioux had some lever-action repeating rifles, and were able to close the distance between them and the 7th Calvary, and exploit their close range firepower.

**World War I**
The time between the Civil War and World War I saw more improvements in firearms; the development of [smokeless powder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_powder) that could drive bullets faster than blackpowder, the [spitzer (pointy) bullet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_bullet), [machine guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_gun), [automatic rifles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_rifle), and [submachine guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submachine_gun)

Smokless powder greatly reduced the smoke signature that a soldier produced when firing his rifle; it also pushed bullets a lot faster than blackpowder in a smaller package, and when coupled with pointed bullets, and a greater understanding of trajectories, allowed rifles to be even more effective at longer ranges.

Bolt-action repeating rifles like the [Gewhr 98](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gewehr_98#M_98_controlled-feed_bolt-action_system) that could fire the new cartridges that were much more effective at longer-ranges, and stipper clips/chargers allowed bolt-action rifles to be reloaded much quicker than the previous generation of lever-action repeating rifles.

Machine guns like the [Maxim gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_gun) that fired the newer cartridges made it much easier for entrenched armies to hold ground against infantry and calvary charges; when coupled with a knowledge of trajectories (the arc the bullet flies), it was a very good terrain denial weapon. 

Much of the focus during World War I was trying to find ways to overcome the stalemate that machine guns, bolt-action rifles, and artillery created. Armored cars and tanks were a direct result of World War I. As far as firearms were concerned, efforts were focused on developing weapons that allowed infantry to gain ground again;  light machine guns, automatic rifles, and submachine guns, guns were developed in an effort to allow infantry to gain and hold ground again. 

Light machine guns were simply designed to be mobile machine guns, and were easier to carry when assaulting a trench-line, and could be quickly deployed and operated by two people.

Automatic rifles were typically fed by a detachable magazine, and could be operated by one soldier. The initial doctrine (developed by the French) was walking fire, where there would be a line of automatic rifleman that would advance across no-mans land with an Automatic rifle strapped to the hip, and fire a shot every time the left foot struck the ground, and create a wall of lead that would kill the germans...needless to say, it was not a very good idea. As a result, the automatic rifles were used much in the same way a light-machine gun would be; to bring an increased amount of firepower against the enemy, and allow rifleman to advance.

Submachine guns fired a pistol cartridge out of a detachable magazine, and were so that soliders would have a lot of close range firepower to overwhelm an enemies trench and take it over in a short period of time.

It would not be until World War II that they would their worth when coupled with tanks, trucks, and airpower that long lines of fortifications would be overcame.

**World War II**

World War II was fought with much of the same technology as the First World War, except mechanization could overcome trench-lines. Airplanes, artillery, and tanks could be massed at a single point, and then punch through a defensive line, surround it, and cut off it's supplies.

Most of Europe went to war with the same bolt-action rifles it had carried in World War I, but also saw the much wide issue of submachine guns, light machine guns, and automatic rifles. Infantry tactics were focused on how to strike a balance between short-range firepower and long range accuracy, as well as having the foot soliders be able to keep up with and support the tanks.

The United States entered World War II with the [M1 Garand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Garand) which was a semi-automatic rifle that increased the firepower of the infantry rifleman without having to sacrifice the range or accuracy of a bolt-action rifle. Towards the end of the War, Germany and the Soviet Union also began to issue semi-automatic rifles.

The most notable firearms advance came in the form of the Assault Rifle. The idea behind the Assault Rifle was to combine all of the best aspects of a submachine gun, and an automatic rifle, and a semi-automatic rifle into one, and develop a weapon that was more suitable for fast-paced warfare. The German [FG42](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FG42) was an early attempt at an Assault rifle, but was not much more useful than a semi-automatic rifle because it used a full-power rifle cartridge which has too much recoil to be effective in a lightweight rifle. 

The next attempt at an assault rifle (and where the namesake comes from) was the Stg.44; the Stg.44 has all of the hallmarks of what makes an assault rifle an assault rifle; it was select fire, and fired an intermediate cartridge. In order to make it somewhat useful in full-auto, it fired a unique cartridge that was a dramtically shortend rifle cartridge. It was select fire, so it could be fired semi-automatic (one shot at a time) or full-auto (bunches of shots per trigger pull). Basically, the Assault Rifle sacrificed the extreme-range of the full powered rifle cartridge for some of the short range utility of the submachine gun; it was intended to be a much more useful weapon in a mobile war where accurate long range rifle fire was not as useful.

**Vietnam**

The United States fought the Korean War was fought with the same firearms that were used in World War II; it would not be until Vietnam that the United States would have a real Assault Rifle.

Following World War II, the United States was left with a lot of different weapons that filled a niche role, and wanted a rifle that could replace many different weapons. The M14 rifle that the United States adopted in 1959 had the exact same pitfalls as the German FG42; it tried to do too many things at once. The Army did not want to sacrifice the long range firepower of a full sized rifle, but also wanted something in a rifle-sized package that could be used as an automatic rifle, rifle, and submachine gun. The full powered rifle cartridge made it uncontrollable in full-automatic fire, and as a result, it was really only an adequate replacement for the semi-automatic M1 Garand rifle.

The [M16 rifle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M16_rifle) is the only true assault rifle adopted by the United States, and has been the standard arm for over 40 years in one form or another. The M16 was fired a smaller/lighter cartridge from a 20-round box magazine, and was select-fire. The M16 also incorporate the use of aluminum and plastic into the rifle and was signficantly lighter than previous rifles. It fills the same gap that all assault rifles are supposed to fill; it is intended to be a flexible weapon for fast moving mechanized warfare.

Except for some major snafus (the rifle was hastily adopted, and did not work well), it was well suited for Vietnam and close range jungle warfare. 

**Vietnam-Now**

Following Korean War, there was an effort to replace all of the niche weapons with with a common rifle that could do a little bit of everything, since it is easier to train and maintain just one rifle system instead of four. In our two latest wars, there has been a reversal of that trend on some levels; the intermediate cartridge that the M16 fires is not very useful for long range engagements. In the mountains of Afghanistan, this has became fairly apparent, and rifles have been issued to fill the long-range engagement niche. Even the discarded M14 rifles saw a comeback as a Designated Marksman rifle.

The main advancement in the infantry soldiers area has came in the form of rugged telescopic sights, and night vision observation devices; the rifles remain much the same as they were in the Vietnam war.

**Modern Firearms in Civilian Hands**

People that are advocates for an ""Assault Weapons Ban"" believe that military weapons should not be in the hands of civilians, and view it as an oddity that is perculiar to this time in our history. The fact of the matter is that American civilians and hobbyists have always had access to modern firearms; basically, until the National Firearms Act of 1934, there was no attempt to discourage Americans from using the latest and greatest firearms.

The long-range single-shot rifles that were used by hunters following the Civil War to slaughter buffallo were identical in function and capability to the single-shot rifles that were issued to Custers calvary. Lever-action repeating rifles, and revolvers were used by Native Americans in their fight against settlers, and by settlers in their fight against the Native Americans. I also do not doubt they were used in the Pullman and Homestead Strikes of the late 19th century.

The bolt-action repeating rifles that many envision when they think of a 'hunting rifle' mimmick the bolt-action repeating rifles of World War I. The companies the produced bolt-action rifles for World War I produced the same rifles for civilian purposes on the same equipment, that fired the same cartridges, or made improved civilian counterparts that did the exact same thing.  Theodore Roosevelt used a [Springfield 1903 Rifle](http://www.nrablog.com/post/2012/10/09/Springfield-Armory-delivers-Theodore-Roosevelt-Rifle-to-NRA-National-Firearms-Museum.aspx) on a Safari in 1909, only 3 years after the 30-06 cartridge was adopted.

It wasn't until the [National Firearms Act of 1934](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Firearms_Act) that any widespread attempt was made to regulate what was available to civilians. The NFA was spurred on by highly reported events like the St. Valentines Day Massacre, and the personalities of Bonnie and Clyde, and John Dillinger, as well as the portrayal of ""Gangsters"" in Hollywood. The reality is that machine guns were not the weapons of choice for criminals of the time; yet the tommy gun has became iconic of the prohibition/depression era. The NFA made it harder for people to aquire automatic weapons, short-barrelled shotguns, and suppressors by imposing a $200.00 excise tax, as well as getting approval from a local law enforcement officer in order to own an item that fell under the NFA.

Following World War II, millions of surplus bolt-action rifles were imported into the United States and sold to civilians; and there was a cottage industry around taking these old military rifle and sporter-izing them, which basically consisted in altering the stock of the rifle.

Semi-automatic hunting rifles introduced after World War II, such as the Remington 740 gave hunters a similar level of firepower to the M1 Garand.

Colt began selling a semi-automatic AR15 to civilians in 1962 after the AirForce had adopted it; but it wouldn't be until 1967 that the AR15 was standardized as the M16A1 by the US Army.

In 1994, the Federal Assault Weapons ban was enacted which banned a certain combination of mostly cosmetic features. (I am sure you have all heard about it in the last month. Like the NFA of 1934, public perception and the media played an important role, and inflated the role that these types of rifles had in the overall picture of gun crime, or violent crime in general. 

Probably the most blatant/obvious/daming instance of the United States has to do with how formal target shooting, and surplus rifles are handled. Based on his experiences in the Spanish-American War, and the general lack of marksmanship accumen of the general populace, Theodore Roosevelt created the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice, and the Director of Civilian Marksmanship in 1906.

The whole purpose of the DCM was the promotion of Civilian Marksmanship using current service rifle of the time, so that the United States would have quite a few accomplished marksman when it needed to draft soldiers to fight a war. The DCM provided service rifles and pistols to clubs for civilian use, or civilians could just outright purchase them for their own use. The DCM also provided ammunition for match shooting that was identical the ammo used on the battlefields for next to no cost.

The National Matches were also established in 1906 as part of the DCM, and is a competition for all of the best service rifle and service pistol shooters in the country. Following World War II, the National Matches also began to incorporate Olympic style smallbore rifle, and smallbore pistol matches.

Currently, the National Matches still takes place every year, and last over a month for all of the different shooting disciplines, and is put on by the Civilian Marksmanship Program (the DCM was privatized in 1996). By far the biggest crowd turns out for the Service Rifle competition (around 1400 shooters). Every year, the Army runs the [Small Arms Firing School](http://www.odcmp.com/NM/SAFS.htm) at the National Matches, and trains civilian and military shooters alike on the same M16 rifles that have been issued overseas.

Labor would become much cheaper, because employers could effectively pay after-tax salaries. Labor would become much more cost effective than it is now. However, corps would probably suffer overall.

Salaries would come down but take-home income would go up, consumer spending would go op (because anything spent can be deducted) while corporate profits would fall due to the tax hit. 

Just a silly example: if someone built a car-building robot and formed an LLC to license it to a factory, the LLC could deduct expenditures before paying taxes. Meanwhile, the human car-builder who would have to compete with the robot for the job at the factory would have to eat taxes on any income he receives from the factory. If the robot could survive on $500 a month in maintenance while the person could survive on $450 per month in food and shelter, the robot would get the job because the human would need greater than $500 / month in take-home pay before taxes.

Hello, /r/Ask_Politics.
I've come here - for the first time - to ask for your help in what I feel is a blatant violation of my rights. 

I am a high school student (so forgive me if any of this seems poorly-presented), and today I was informed that I was to serve multiple detentions for not standing in place during the pledge of allegiance. I feel as though this is a violation of my liberties to express myself and abstain from religion. My main question is: What can I do about this?

(Edit here, bold added for emphasis.) **My mother told me to contact a lawyer, but I don't want to make a big deal of it... I just want my rights to be acknowledged** so that I don't have to glorify ideals that I don't agree with and a god that I don't believe in. I'd like to take this to a higher-up in the school, just to have a victory at home, but how would I go about doing this? Do I even have a legitimate case to offer to the superintendent? If I have to be completely honest, I'm scared. But if I don't speak up, it's going to be a long time before enough people do to even make a small ripple in this world.

I tried to keep my description short as to not waste anyone's time. If anyone sees this and wants more details, please just ask. I'll post it in the comments or just edit this post.

Words can't express how much gratitude I have for anyone who reads this, and how much more I have for anyone who can help. Even if you agree with the pledge of allegiance, please look past that and see this solely as an infringement of my rights.

Edit: This is a great impression I'm getting from this community. I've seen some Reddit threads online so I thought I'd take a crack at asking you guys. This was a risk because I've also seen some really arrogant people on this site to the extent that I've never come on here before. Thank you to everyone who is helping me, you all seem to be very informed and helpful people.

Edit: I'd like to quote a comment I made in regards to everyone. ""... this is why I made this thread, I felt as though I had my rights violated and people are confirming/refuting it with (typically) helpful information/opinions.""

So even the people who are saying I did not have my rights violated, I respect your legal opinions and appreciate them. (Unless you're blatantly being rude. There's a better way to share your thoughts than outwardly calling someone a ""cunt."" You people know who you are.) Thanks again, everyone.

Would Senators from Massachusetts accept pre-clearance if it meant getting Texas covered again?

-Afghanistan began more or less under the AUMF, or the Authorization of the Use of Military Force Act, which allowed the executive to act unilaterally against any person, group, or nation if ""he determined"" (in the text of the act) that the person, group, or nation had something to do with the 9/11 attacks.  Can he withdraw from Afghanistan unilaterally?

-The invasion of Iraq was authorized throught the Authorization of the Use of Military Force in Iraq act in 2002.  Does he require congressional authorization to withdraw, or can the executive branch unilaterally withdraw and close military bases?

-The United States has military bases in over 150 nations.  Can the executive unilaterally close these bases or does that require congressional approval?

-Guantanamo prison base was established in 2002 and houses inmates without warrants or due process.  I know that it is illegal, as of a few years ago, for Guantanamo prisoners to be moved into the United States, but the executive can still technically release the prisoners if he so desired, unilaterally.  At least this is my understanding.

-Finally, unwarranted surveillance of American citizens, and detention without due process, both have occurred under the Patriot Act and the NDAA.  Could Obama unilaterally dismantle the NSA and the DHS without congressional approval?

I ask a few things in this thread:

a) remain civil.  I have certain beliefs, as do you.  I ask that we respect each other and refrain from emotional responses or attacks against any person.  This is in the rules of the forum and yet it is routinely violated.

b) please be critical of the above points I've made.  If anything is inaccurate, please show me in what way it is inaccurate and where the mistake is that I've made.  You and I are (hopefully) both here to learn.

c) I would ask that you add any relevant information you might have so that we can get closer to an answer of the question posed: exactly what can Obama do unilaterally under the powers the executive branch now possesses, and what does he require congressional approval for?

This is not a question about what Obama SHOULD do, it is a question about what Obama and the executive branch CAN do under current laws.

I consider myself ""pro life"" because I don't agree with taking an innocent life.  However, I have not seen much in depth analysis of when life is considered to begin.  Is it after conception, when there is viable human DNA in the cells?  Or perhaps when a nervous system or brain begins to develop?

Of course this would still be a heavily debated issue, but I feel it would allow more scientific reasoning to enter the argument and remove some of the ambiguity (eg. instead of ""aborting a fetus is wrong"" or ""women have a choice of what to do with their bodies"" you would have ""destroying an innocent being with such and such characteristics is considered murder, define the characteristics"").

And I just saw this today indicating that things are pretty bad in the UK as well:

&gt;More than 30 of the coalition's flagship schemes, including Universal Credit and high-speed rail, are at serious risk of failure, a report says.

&gt;The government's Major Projects Authority (MPA) has given 32 schemes a red or amber/red rating, meaning they are deemed unachievable or in doubt.

&gt;[also] two £7bn aircraft carriers dogged by delays, and a new passport applications system.

\-  which last I understand to be a plan for

&gt;the amalgamation of various welfare payments into one unified entitlement which will vary in “real time” as claimants’ circumstances change – is at the very heart of the British government‘s plans to reform the welfare state.

&gt;Universal Credit is ... a massive financial and social (and hence political) risk for the government. Unless delivered on time and on budget then the consequences are grave – some of the most vulnerable people in society could be left literally destitute, with all that entails for their personal welfare and social order.

The governments of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Greece don't seem to be really coping ether.

**[Edit]**  One more example, from today -

Spain has spent $680 Million to build a new submarine, the *Isaac Peral*.  

Unfortunately it weighs 75 to 100 tons more than it should and thus *cannot resurface once it submerges.*

Bit of a problem, wouldn't you say?

Now as I understand it, the computing and information technology revolution of the last few decades should be making bureaucracies (such as governments) function better across the board. 

This either isn't happening or the situation would actually be absolutely hellish if not being propped up by said computing and IT. 

So what's going on?  

Why can't modern governments in developed countries function at even a minimal level?

 Assault weapons such as the semi-auto AR-15 are not battle rifles such as the automatic M-15. A weapon like an AR-15 is the modern day weapon of civil defense when local law enforcement breaks down.  For example, in Iraq every home is allow one AK-47 for civil defense. During the LA riots shop owners using AR-15 saw significantly less property destruction when compared to others. During Katrina when individual would return to their homes in the wake of the destruction some would carry AR-15s for personal protection. It is the kind of weapon that can deter and defend against a group, gang, or mob like violence most likely in a time of civil duress. I find it sensible that a rural has a strong affinity for the right to bear arms because local law enforcement response times are higher.  I've heard that in Argentina, when civil order broke down it was the rural areas that saw the most heinous crimes as criminals need to concern themselves with a law enforcement response.

Anti-depressants are prescribed like vitamins and are expected to be a cure-all for your blues. Missing work for a particularly bad bout is not considered a legitimate reason, and you can be fired for it. Anyone with depression is expected to just power through any particularly crippling days and go to work. It's incredibly hard to get disability status for depression as well.

However, in the UK, depression is actually considered a real illness and is accepted by employers to be a legitimate reason for missing work, provided that you have a doctor's note. I do recognize that there's a limited amount of sick pay you get through NHS - 6 months - but that's still infinitely more than you'd ever get in the US. If you're fired for missing work for it, you can sue, unless you're declared unfit for work. In that case, you can demand a payoff from them.

How has perception evolved so differently between the two countries over time? Is this because of that ""good ol' American work ethic"" or just because employees are simply more valued in the UK?

I personally believe that the dissent of the constituency doesn't matter too much, the government has penetrated  very efficiently into the public opinion through crackdown on media and electorate reform. Recently Putin's approval went down a lot, but it's still above 60%, which is higher than any of the Western leaders. The economic inadequacies, the so-called 'Dutch Disease' seems like it would at least worry the regime the most.

EDIT: okay, since replies so far have been insignificant I'll add something to my opinion. I think what really bothers Kremlin is its inability to become noticed as an international power. The energy card doesn't really work as oil's price fluctuates too much and Russia is too volatile of a seller for European countries to become dependant on (example of Ukraine during the Orange Revolution). Even despite the Golden Years in the mid 2000s and avoiding of the crushing effect of the global economic crisis through an oil-amassed stabilisation fund, Russia still finds itself largely unlistened to; with a 4-5% share of the global economy and literally no international allies (apart from Germany maybe, but that's a tricky relationship as well.)

I love when issues transcend typical partisan divide.

Its even more fun when it creates contradictory views *in the same person*.  For example, I'm **l**ibertarian - I think we need as little government as possible to secure what we need and then only make sure that those laws don't create an uneven market.

This is one of those cases that does that.  On the one hand, burdening some entities with sales tax collection but not others strikes me as market interference - the sales tax should either be allied to all (thus pro-Internet Sales tax) or should be abolished for all.  Now, I don't like the latter as the government *will* get the revenue it needs (even if it is smaller) in some way: property taxes, income taxes, etc.

But on the other hand, why should we allow the government to do this when there is already laws on the books that they should just enforce.  I haven't checked every state and jurisdiction, but most sales taxes statutes also include *use tax* provisions - if somehow the sales tax is not collected by the entity, you must report it to the state and pay the sales tax.  This is because, again I presume, most statutes, the sales tax is the responsibility of the purchaser.  It is only collected by the seller for ease of collection.  So the other side of me says that we should not allow the Internet Sales Tax and simply force the government to go after citizens.  The **l**ibertarian in me sees this as a positive in the end - if people are being harassed and annoyed by government, they are less likely to ask for larger government.

Apportionment being the number of constituents to representatives. The biggest issue is population discrepancies between states. 

Wyoming (the least populous state, about 500,000) has one representative, while Montana (population 1,000,000) also has only one. That's twice the population with only half the influence. Then there is Washington D.C. with about 600,000 residents and no representation in the house.

Of course each state is guaranteed at least one congressional representative, but why should they be?  If the House was truly meant to be ""of the people"", then why were the founders concerned with guaranteeing a representative to one State? Now our hands are tied and we are stuck with constitutional ""Malapportionment"" (Wesberry v. Sanders, held that the population differences among Georgia's congressional districts were so great as to violate the Constitution).

Why not guarantee one representative to a contiguous geographical area not limited by state boundaries? I think this would solve the problem of ""Constitutional Malapportionment"" and give representation to D.C. residents.

Problem is who would draw these districts? It would no longer be left up to the states. If Congress was in charge of drawing their own districts this could lead to some major gerrymandering. 

The Voting Rights Act does not prohibit states from redistricting as they please and when they please. Gerrymandering is legal as long as the district is contiguous, of appropriate population size, and are not made for the purpose of discriminating based on race or color.

In my opinion Gerrymandering is an ugly thing. I don't want to see it continue and I would hate to see it implemented in a unbound district based purely on population.

So I'm admittedly a big fan of the PPACA, and thought I was decently well informed on it. I really enjoyed the ELI5 post on the topic which gave great bullet points and citations.

Anyhow, there seems to be a large group of people who believe themselves to be getting screwed over by this, and the one group that I happen to think really *are* getting screwed over are career servers. I'm a part-time server as a second job, and many of the people in the restaurant that use serving as their sole source of income are up in arms because of Obamacare.

So basically, since these restaurants are large enough to require healthcare coverage, they are answering by simply not allowing people to work enough hours to be considered ""full time"" and thus not providing it. Also, the company I work for *used* to have a great health care program for the servers which they could buy into, but have scrapped that in favor of the full coverage plan, which they only offer to full time employees, then making sure that the servers do not qualify for enough hours to be full time.

From the sounds of things, some restaurants aren't even trying to be coy about what they are doing (probably in an attempt to turn people against Obamacare so that they can try and get it overturned). As I understand it (and no I do not work for this company so I might not be getting accurate information) Applebees was mistaken about the number of hours to qualify, forcing people to work no more than 1 hour less than full time cut off. Once they learned they had the cutoff wrong, and people were working full time, they simply cut peoples hours back further.

The problem is, most of the people in this industry do not have a salaried position elsewhere. This is their job. So suddenly you have a large group of people who *used* to have pretty OK health coverage, and a full time job, that are now told they may not work full time and their health care plan has been taken away. Then, with the mandate coming into effect soon, they're afraid that in addition to less work and no health coverage that they want, they'll have to pay a fine for not being insured.

I have a pretty good amount of experience for my age and seemingly impress my superiors, but our legislative cycle is ending soon and I am basically out of a job until next January and then can jump on another campaign next April. 

However, I have an opportunity to run a State House race in one of the states that holds odd year elections. Unfortunately, it is a pretty tough race; the Republican is a 30 year incumbent and the closest election I could find was an 11 point margin and that was in 2007. In 2011 he won by considerably more than that, though the Dem was pretty much a paper candidate. 

I am pretty confident in my ability to run an effective campaign and get as close of a margin as is possible, but I think that victory may not be possible even if we run a perfect campaign. 

So my question is, is it worth it to run a losing race in order to get a paycheck and some experience or will a loss on a race that may not even be targeted by the state party look like I don't have a good filter of where I should work? 

I have been applying for other state level jobs as well and part of me thinks I should just wait and see if something better comes up, but then I think that an off year job as a manager is something I should take and run with.

Outdated?,KawiNinja,22,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/18hk9w/arent_we_a_little_outdated/,"So I'm sitting here at my desk with a broken arm, (motorcycle accident), and since, haven't had much to do recently, so I've been sitting at my computer for the majority of the past few weeks. 

Anyways while surfing the web I noticed a lot of, ""polls"" all over the place. Political, Hollywood, trivia, ect. And it got me thinking... Some of these polls have quite a few voters, why do we not use a more direct way of connecting politics to the average American citizen?

I can understand that when America was originally founded, it was logical thinking to have representatives from each state, county, city, and so forth. But what I don't understand is that we no longer live way back in the day and yet we operate the same way. I have to hope that my 1 representative of my state or county is going to vote the way I would vote every conflict of issue that arises or when passing new things into law. Which I find ridiculous. Especially considering how corrupt the old outdated system is now. 

Back in the day it would take a ridiculous amount of time for people to travel to one location or to all cast paper votes about every little thing that went through congress. And we have come some ways now with technology that have helped us and the current system. But why have we not gone much much farther?

The way I see it we should throw out our old corrupt congress bastards and move towards allowing the choices that are made within this country to be made by this country's people themselves. Have a central government website that allows anyone with valid citizenship to take polls in everything or anything that effects them or their family in any way. It's not as hard to vote anymore as It was back in the day, we need to evolve our system. To hell with our corrupt legal system as well on a local level at least. Who needs a judge? If it is a crime that happened within the area my family lives then I should have a fair say in what be done with said person. Cause the way it is now, it only takes 1 person to corrupt a legal decision, however if everyone in the city is allowed to look in on the case and make a personal decision on what they feel should be done and vote on a simple quick multi choice poll it will take a large majority to screw with anything.

This wouldn't even create a job crisis. People will now be needed to help format these polls and help choose what the four or more options to vote on in the poll should be.

Anyways the main thing I'm getting as is why are we not moving towards a more accessible government if in fact we have become a more accessible society?

My exposure to American congress folk has been limited solely to T.V. and various media sources including reddit. I have also seen a few episodes of House of Cards.

So with that limited amount of exposure, and especially with the portrayal in House of Cards, I can't help but feel that folks in congress are all in the 'upper crust' so to speak which makes me question their ability to relate to the middle or working class. Am I wrong or right in my perception? Are all congress people considered...'rich folks?' It seems like it given the champagne and caviar life style that is portrayed and often seen in the news.

Also as a Canadian, I think perhaps the same can be said of many of our own politicians as well, but politics is not something I'm authoritatively knowledgeable in, and so I'll let others more in the know fill in the gaps.

Perhaps the real question is ... in North America, is being rich a prerequisite to being a politician? (non-rhetorical serious question from someone who is not familiar with the deep inner workings of politics.)


Edit: Thanks for all the responses. It has been very informative! One take away I'm getting is that the notion of what's middle class and what's not is still up for heavy debate depending on who you ask.

In Ontario, Canada, government employees have to have their salaries disclosed if they make over $100k/year. This isn't always the case because there are some loopholes that people use to get around it, but for the most part, this is what happens.

This creates an accessible threshold for people to use in terms of classifying income brackets. I do not agree with this definition because it says nothing of the worth of that a person - simply that they are a government worker and that they are paid $100k/year or more. Much bitterness is spewed because of this, and this is a source of resentment and vitriol that sometimes gets espoused in the local newspaper comment sections because some people see the $100k number as some magical barrier that turns one from being a 'normal' person to a 'rich' or 'privileged' person. I do not agree with this in particular.

I know respondents will want to move along to rating different branches of governments and parties after making a general rating, so please be comprehensive (each house in congress, all the caucuses you are familiar with, the Obama administration, as well as the SCOTUS and perhaps any state government or portion of state government you would like to rate on this spectrum.)

For the purposes of this spectrum it is my understanding that the terms may not mean the same thing as they would in this context, below I will try to define the terms for this purpose to the best of my ability.

'Radical': Seeking significant change at once,

'Liberal'/'Progressive': Seeking moderate change, or perhaps even significant change but incrementally

'Centrist': Amenable to efforts to enact some change, also amenable to efforts to maintain the present course of action.

'Conservative': Seeking to preserve the present state of affairs, to 'conserve' the status quo.

'Reactionary': Seeking to restore the previous state of affairs from the immediate (or perhaps even not so immediate) past

I grew up in a very left-leaning atheist household (in the 80's) in the SF Bay Area.  I moved to Boston to attend BU, graduated with a scientific degree, and have supported Democrats every since I could vote and advocate.  My current job's biggest client is the DNC itself.

Currently, I get a lot of my news from left-leaning sources.  I either watch or podcast both Maddow and Hayes on MSNBC practically every day(Although I thought Olbermann was kind of a blowhard).  I read Krugman and Klein.  I check dailyKos once or twice a day along with HuffPo, ThinkProgress, Media Matters, at least once.  
But, I don't read a lot of news from the conservative perspective.  Partially, this is because the conservative news that gets a lot of attention that I come across is generally Fox News or AM Talk Radio like Rush or Savage or the like.  Given the systemic dishonesty of those sources, I find it hard to assume a conservative point of view in my head without falling back to some of the ridiculous arguments presented there.  

But I believe that civil discourse and the exchange of ideas based on facts, reason, and logic, as well as the results from research and study is what will move this country forward.  I don't care whether ideas came from liberals or conservatives, I believe they should be judged on their merits, their expectations for success based on evidence and reasonable, unbiased prediction.

With that being said, I'm looking for some conservative news sources that are well above the journalistic integrity of Fox News.  I'm looking for people that present their facts and studies and sources and then draw conclusions.  I'm not looking for Michelle Malkin or Ann Coulter.

State parties are their own entities, to deal with state law.

The [reddit submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1k0wmg/detroit_community_beats_alleged_rapist_of_15_yo/) is here, but I saw [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1k0wmg/detroit_community_beats_alleged_rapist_of_15_yo/cbkaai3) from /u/kiklion:

&gt;I understand that there are many solutions with various pros and cons, but I think it may be preferable for the police to declare that they only respond to issues in a certain, smaller area and leave the rest police-less.

&gt;You improve response times in the chosen area, people may naturally move from the unguarded to the guarded, and people who currently have practically no police response and may falsely believe the police will be there 'shortly' will at least know that the police won't be coming.

The small part of me that is tempted by anarchism loves this idea as those who live in the ""wilderness"" that this idea creates would band together and survive... but the realist in me says it would just create lawless zones and things would get worse, not better.

I doubt anyone here would think I'm quick in suggesting it... but perhaps one solution is to simply use the power of the state (whether it is the state or the federal government) to declare eminent domain for all the property outside a certain radius that can be effectively controlled and, in addition, relocate these people into this zone?

Essentially, consolidate Detroit into a more defensible position.

The issue still would be certain zones would still be abandoned, but the idea is that with few residence, they would become ghost towns and not need near the number of patrols that a populated area would.  You'd have some degree of lawlessness because of those light patrols, but (and maybe a bit of libertarianism is shining through) if people want to do God-knows-what out there, its their business and they can deal with the consequences on their own.

Aside from the sob stories of a great-grandmother being forced out of the house her liberated-slave grandfather build with his one good hand after saving the mayor's daughter from a rampaging lion and has been in their family since... and my own objections to a massive government enterprise like this (which would be a huge target for corruption)...

The article states that a famous supreme court case of Gideon V. Wainright (1) states that anyone accused of a crime has the constitutional right to defense by an attorney.  However, this article argues that this right should be granted to people not accused of a crime.  In some cases, it does involve the penalty of imprisonment by the state, while being a civil matter rather than a criminal one.

The two big ones I'm mainly concerned about is drugs and prostitution. I won't argue why here since that's not the point of this question.

However I know that our current state of politics and mindset of people disagrees with me. I just wonder if anyone understands the possibilities of such things or if there are any credible studies showing opinions might change and politics may adapt to such change. Doesn't have to be now or within the next 5 years, but let's say in the next 40 years.

I know pot will most likely be legalized, but I'm curious what people think about the more debatable types.

The USA is already quite lenient in comparison to many other countries (e.g. porn, adultery, abortion, alcohol), but that can't stop even more progress or change from happening.

&gt;In February 1934, Long introduced his Share Our Wealth plan over a nationwide radio broadcast. He proposed capping personal fortunes at $50 million and repeated his call to limit annual income to $1 million and inheritances to $5 million. (He also suggested reducing the cap on personal fortunes to $10 million–$15 million per individual, if necessary, and later lowered the cap to $5 million–$8 million in printed materials.) The resulting funds would be used to guarantee every family a basic household grant of $5,000 and a minimum annual income of $2,000–3,000, or one-third of the average family homestead value and income. Long supplemented his plan with proposals for free college education and vocational training for all able students, old-age pensions, veterans' benefits, federal assistance to farmers, public works projects, greater federal regulation of economic activity, a month's vacation for every worker and limiting the work week to thirty hours to boost employment.[29]

It seems that limiting personal wealth would allow for supply side economics to actually work, since the wealthy couldn't horde infinite (for all intents and purposes) wealth.

I'm more that sure that the news that broke yesterday are true and that most of the PP (the governing party) are corrupt and indeed splitting the money amongst themselves. 

I've been part of the 15M (The spanish revolution) and been on the street lots of times in the last years. 

The problem is, this people have no shame, they'll cling on to their seat as long as possible and there is no power in our system that could stop them from doing that. They'll deny everything with a smile on their face and are (rightfully) convinced that nobody can prove anything (they are good at what they do). 

How do I know that, you may ask now, and I'll tell you that I've seen it al before. It happened with Francisco Camps, the president of la Comunitat Valenciana, who was accused of corruption (he got presents in exchange of favours). First he would deny everything, later on he would admit getting presents, but in the trial nobody could prove that he got them in exchange of favours. He kept his seat after ""getting back his honor"" and after a while he resigned. 

It happened with la trama Gürtel, a enormous corruption scandal with lots of people from the PP involved and ended with the lead Judge (Garzón) losing his job because of some illegal obtained evidence. Evidence that, although illegal, proved the corruption. No charges, no reaction, nothing. 

And it will happen again. 

People are tired of going out to the streets because the media manipulates and plays down the numbers. People are tired because the police will beat them for no reason. People are tired because there's no reaction from the leaders. They are just there so they can get more money, cling on their seats and get a good job in a big spanish corporation after they leave.

Peacefully we can't and won't get anything. There's no hope they'll resign out of shame. There's no hope there will be a investigation clear and neutral enough. And what's worse, tax offences expire after 4 years, so even if we can proof that they are indeed corrupt they won't have to face a trial or go to jail.

To answer this question though, i'll sum up the main differences between direct and indirect demoncracies.

A direct democracy: In the swiss system, we do not vote for our President (indeed we don't have one, we have a collegiate of 7 ministers with one main representative that takes on the mantle of President every 2 year term, however that is not the point of this question). We vote for our representatives on a communal, cantonal (read states for Americans) and federal level. Direct democracy allows us also to vote on referendums. Laws that are considered not urgent, or which are contentious, are put to the people (constitutional laws). We vote several times a year on whether or not to pass new laws, on federal and cantonal level. This means that we have a more direct level of control over what laws are passed by the governing class. For a law to pass on a federal level, a double majority must be met: Population and state. This stops the highly populous states (such as Zurich, 1/7th of the population) from imposing laws on far smaller states (such as Appenzell-Rhodes interior, which is 0.2% of the population).

Indirect democracy: Giving the members of the governing class (whether at the level of congress/parlement or President/PM) free reign over a predetermined time, to pass what laws they want, so long as they reach a majority in their respective chambers (congress/senate or commons/lords, etc...).

So what I'm interested in is whether or not other countries (GB, GE, USA, Fr, J...) would be interested in having a more direct control of the laws they pass, in particular if they would like the idea of being able to have their say in laws that their governing bodies are trying to pass.",,False,,t5_2t160,False,,,True,t3_174puq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/174puq/would_other_countries_be_interested_to_implement/,

If the argument is that he worked in a firm that also propagated the housing market bubble--prop trading desks are NOT ALLOWED to get nonpublic information the other parts of the firm, especially banking (who packages the mortgages). The SEC has very strict guidelines regarding this... if the prop desk shorted housing, they would have no more information than any other hedge/mutual/pension fund. If there was evidence that they did have insider/nonpublic information regarding mortgages, it would be another thing entirely, but to the best of my knowledge this has never been proven of Citi's prop desk or any other entity that shorted housing.

These figures are not just 10 or 20% too low, they are often a fraction of what it really costs, as in less than a half or a third. Also, only a few articles have brought up what I see as major gotchas in the bill that are going to make or break its affordability for families. 

Also, there have been many important questions which remain unanswered which speak to who will bear the cost of the huge expenses of health insurance. This cost can often exceed many families income, and I do not see the government paying it. Nor can employers pay it when costs are rising so quickly, Nor can freelance workers - the self-employed - as they have no employer and no access to still-expensive group plans (many people dont realize that the nongroup market is even more expensive - sometimes 200-300% MORE expensive.) 

The cost of health insurance doesn't suddenly shrink when the income of a family exceeds 400% of the Federal Poverty Line. It remains the same, and that insurance could easily cost more than half or often, more of a families take home income.

Why are they doing this?

Try as I might though, I cannot reason out a reason why the government in the novel would not work almost perfectly. If you have not read the book and have only seen the crazy interpretation which was the movie, you probably have no idea what I am talking about. There is a reason that the novel is on top of every sci-fi “must read” list. Aside from some awesome space marine combat, it delves into the ethics of what it means to lead, both individuals and collectives, and what it means to wield sovereign franchise. The blend of this action and politics, rolled together without becoming remotely preachy, is why this book has resonated throughout the decades since its publication and is still extremely popular.

Before reading on, please purge your mind of everything that has to do with the Starship Trooper’s movie. The fascist pseudo-Nazi government you see in that film is only vaguely reminiscent of the meritocratic democracy portrayed in the book. 

The futuristic governing system in place in the book relies heavily on the idea of franchise. Heinlein defines it as the right to influence the collective, whether by suffrage or representation in congress. His society is divided into three separate populations. There are citizens, those who have earned their franchise, civilians, those who have not, and the service members who will earn their citizenship and franchise upon retirement. The system mirrors America’s currently in that is an open democracy, with the right to earn franchise not limited to anyone based on creed, color, sex, etc. Any member of the society can sign up to earn their franchise by undergoing a term of federal service. This service reflects the talents and characteristics of the individual applying. Heinlein puts forward that the Federal service is 95% non-military, with only a small portion actually involved in combat arms. The rest is a huge bureaucracy filled with volunteers working in a specialized service field. 

If one is soldierly, they might become a soldier, if one is postal-workerly, they might work in the postal service. If a blind person applies, they might be sent to Antarctica to count the hairs on the backs of caterpillars by touch for their term, all that matters is that at some point, every citizen stood up and said that the good of the collective was worth more than my own personal well-being. One is free to quit their training or their service at any time (unless in the face of the enemy), free of consequence, if they decide that franchise is not worth the sacrifice. There is no effort to hunt down deserters, but once someone leaves the service before their term is up, they cannot reapply for their franchise by rejoining the service later.

Heinlein claims that ""[s]ince sovereign franchise is the ultimate in human authority, we insure that all who wield it accept the ultimate in social responsibility — we require each person who wishes to exert control over the state to wager his own life — and lose it, if need be to save the life of the state. The maximum responsibility a human can accept is thus equated to the ultimate authority a human can exert.""

This theme of responsibility tempering authority is one which resonated with me. We allow ourselves to be governed by the whim of a public who has no stake in the collective. Did not our founding fathers intend to allow only those who owned property and therefore had a vested stake in the community to exercise franchise? That just kind of made sense to me. 

Citizens and civilians are held to the same law as each other, and no distinction is ever given to one over the other in any law or court. They are all members of the same society, and are treated thus. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of conscience are wildly protected in this system, but if you want to influence how things are done, you need to demonstrate you understand the responsibility which espouses that power. 

So r/politics, my questions are as follows: Why would this system not work? Why does being born into a system give you the right to change it implicitly? What would be a better way of proving one’s commitment to the ~~collective community~~ **State** than a term of federal service?

I know that some of these ideas are radical, but in my experience I have found that radical ideas prompt the best discussions. Looking forward to it, let me have it.

What many mainstream outlet don't talk about much is the long long history of American meddling in Latin America in the name of fighting communism and to protect the economic interests of our corporations. While we claim to champion ""Freedom"" and ""Democracy"" it is often those things that our foreign policy considers its enemy when Latin America does.

And when I say, ""meddle"" I mean acts of terrorism that we continue to commit. Chavez was one of the few lucky enough to survive our promotion of ""freedom."" The School of the Americas is still open. Democracy Now (http://www.democracynow.org/2013/3/7/operation_condor_trial_tackles_coordinated_campaign) was just talking yesterday about Operation Condor. If you're not familiar with it, you should read up as it was pretty vile what we did, and yet not at all unique, or even in the past really as we still protect terrorists in our own borders. The US is as much a state sponsor of terrorism as any other, we just don't think of it is terrorism when we do it.

Yet, Operation Condor is old news, more or less, not that it is really in our history books. We need that space for hero worship of slave owners and people who committed genoccide.

No, that's not what I am here to debate. You can probably guess where I fall on the question. Instead, what I am interested in was morality, particularly how it applies to foreign policy, the actions of states. I don't agree with it one bit, but there is a line of thinking, oft repeated, here that the actions of states cannot be judged by any sort of morality. That calling a state hypocritical for doing things like publicly championing democracy while overthrowing democracies for dictators, is meaningless. It is a very Machiavellian view. And I would say you could construct a mostly consistent philosophy to say that realistically, there is no morality. People are simply advancing their own interests.

But what does that mean. Suppose the actions of the US on its grumpy days, decisions made by its economic and political elites, who are mostly insulated from public opinion by a media that is essentially made by the elites, suppose those actions are justified because they advance the interest of the state. Can we really divorce any human actions from morality? If we were to do that, it would imply a contradiction, were we to apply it to our daily lives. If you were to behave that the United States did, to behave the way hawkish think-tanks write papers advocating, you would almost certainly be regarded as a sociopath. It is a very ego-centric way of looking at things. In Bob Altemeyer's The Authoritarians, he talks about ""Social Dominators"" the authoritarian leaders that people with authoritarian personalities follow. You would have a very hard time functioning and not experiencing universal condemnation for your actions if you behaved this way, even if they were legal. And there is a reason for that. I do not believe that any human activity can be divorced from morality. State actors are still governed by humans. They are still accountable for what they do. The kind of person who would say ""What's wrong with killing for oil? We need oil!"" is not the kind of person I would trust as a neighbor and I really really don't want to hear their opinion on human rights. They have no leg to stand on when it comes to morality since they have rejected it. We just pawns to be manipulated by them.

The other thing is, I'm not entirely sure most people, if they knew, if they didn't have the social distance that they do from the people impacted by our cruel actions, would tolerate the things that are done in their name, supposedly for their benefit. If anything, the benefits of advancing capitalism, war on people who choose a different system, assassinations, duplicity, spin, they primarily benefit the people at the top. So when I see people called out for criticizing hypocritical or brutal foreign policy as ""naive"" or not ""serious"" because things ""don't work that way."" What I really see is someone concern trolling in favor of the elite, or ""raging for the machine"" if you will. But that's what I made the thread for, a debate.

The boy's thinking was that Reagan's foreign policy, particularly towards spending on the arms race that eventually bankrupted the U.S.S.R., was responsible for preventing nuclear war during the 1980s and 1990s.

I don't quite share his views, but on the subject of ending the Cold War, I told him, ""Tell the kid that he means 'George Bush Senior'.""

My reasoning is that while Reagan's policies were part of what ended the Cold War, Bush Senior was an expert in foreign affairs for having, y'know, chaired the CIA for a bit. A lot of those policies had to have been written by Bush Senior or those working for him rather than directly by Reagan. Even if not directly penned by his hand, he certainly had to have a LOT of influence on them. 

I also think that Reagan was suffering early symptoms of the Alzheimer's that eventually killed him. When he said 'I don't recall...' he really didn't! That would have put a lot more responsibility on Bush Senior to steer foreign affairs, especially during Reagan's second term. 

Finally, when the дерьмо попало в вентилятор in the good ol' CCCP, Bush Senior and his cabinet were directly responsible for moderating the U.S.'s response, as well as much of NATO's, to the breakdown of the Soviet regime and the threat of mutually assured destruction between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R..

Here's some background:  


The National Housing Act of 1934 established the FHA, which is housed within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and gave it the mission of providing federal mortgage insurance in order to provide stability and liquidity in the market, broaden homeownership, protect lending institutions, and stimulate the building industry. [Read more in our committee memo for this hearing. (.pdf)](http://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/041013_committee_memo_2.pdf) 


Today, however, FHA is broke and struggling to shore up the solvency of its single-family insurance fund, known as the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF). The MMIF’s capital reserve ratio—which is a measure of the MMIF’s strength—fell below the statutorily required two percent for the first time in FY 2010 to 0.50 percent. And in February, the [Government Accountability Office (GAO) added the FHA to its list of government programs identified as “high risk](http://financialservices.house.gov/blog/default.aspx?postid=320398) due to their greater vulnerability to fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement or the need for transformation”.

**So what say you, Reddit?** How do we protect hardworking taxpayers from another housing-driven bailout? How do we help future generations of Americans into homes they can actually afford to keep without putting taxpayers at risk? What role (if any?) should the federal government play in housing finance? Looking forward to your comments.

So, my question (really this time), is why hasn't the spending gone done even more after the stimulus? Spending took a big hit with the stimulus but should have deflated just as quickly once the stimulus was over, right?  Are we spending more on programs that we weren't spending as much on in 2007?

But I don't like this standing decision.

The people voted and said they wanted Prop 8.  When challenged, the government refused to defend it in court.  Therefore citizens stood up and defended it.  But the SCOTUS just said that they have no standing to appeal that decision.

That seems to be... horrible precedent.  It would mean that the government could broadcast that it would not defend statute X, Y, and Z... and if those filing lawsuit can find a judge who would overturn those statutes, there is no way to appeal that decision.

What am I missing?  Yes, eventually the government would move to reflect the views of the population, but in some cases it might take years, if not longer because of gerrymandering.

Edit:  Here's a [better telling of my thoughts](http://hotair.com/archives/2013/06/26/supreme-court-prop-8-follow-up-whats-left-of-popular-referendums-now/):

&gt;Forget the gay-marriage stuff for a second and focus on the process. Am I right in understanding that the Court’s now essentially held that if the people of a state pass a popular referendum on whatever subject and then that referendum is challenged and struck down at the trial-court level, they have no right to appeal? They get one bite at the apple and then, if the executive decides he doesn’t like the referendum enough to choose to appeal it himself, there’s nothing a single member of the public can do to ask an appellate court to reconsider the lower court’s decision — even though many millions of voters voted directly to enact the law? That seems … odd.

Seems the entire idea of initiatives and referendums are moot now.  Even if the citizens get it passed, find a judge to declare it unconstitutional and refuse to appeal.

Basically the court has ruled that ""recess appointments"" as we have known them are not constitutional.  They have ruled that the President only has power to appoint someone to a post if that vacancy *arises* during the Recess.  And the court has also done some serious defining of what Recess really means.

It seems to me that the district court not only rebuked Obama's very ""liberal"" interpretation of recess (using that term not politically, but its traditional meaning) and instead *set into law* a very, very restrictive understanding of that power.

It seems to be a suggestion of the right that we are on the brink of a dystopic future (heck, half of them believe the book of revelation is true and that we are very close to an anti-Christ and a beast with seven heads arising to control the world).  It seems totally irrational to me.  I don't stay up late nights worrying about how we might allow slavery again, and with that thinking I find it equally as unlikely that we would be ruled by a tyrannical emperor again.  I feel this is an antiquated portion of the 2nd amendment, just like the 3rd amendment is entirely antiquated.  I completely understand the need for a handgun in order to protect yourself, particularly if you live in a high crime area, but this tyranny argument just causes me to cringe.

A friend of mine took the risk of tyranny to be realistic and/or high, and he quoted me Thomas Jefferson who said *""Experience hath shown, that even under the best forms of government those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny.""*  I feel that Thomas Jefferson had the right to say that for his time, especially since he lived in a time of tyrannical rule from the British.  My friend often quotes the founding fathers as though they are some sort of ""holy scripture.""  As though their words are show-stoppers.  I think our founding governing documents are probably some of the greatest documents in mankind's history, but I certainly don't hold them to some kind of holy standard.  These men owned slaves for godsakes.  They weren't right about everything, and they certainly could not have had the foreknowledge to make every statement that left their mouths be applicable to human kind for all time.

So, my question is this: has there ever been a democracy that has, from within, become tyrannical?  I know we have had democracies dating back to the ancient Greeks, but I'm not really too knowledgeable on the history of democratic nations.

While this might be naive, growing up I was constantly exposed to works of fiction and non-fiction that detailed a utopia, a world with equality, scientific breakthrough, and a society that genuinely worked for the betterment of it's people. Right now, we have calls against PRISM, fights for both gender equality and sexual equality and the disparity between religion and science is becoming ever more prominent as rationality becomes a more common way of thinking. I truly hope that one day I'll live in a world where we as nations could look towards the future and realise the true potential that we as a species have. 

From what I know none of this will happen without social progression in some form. Whether it be the death of baby boomers (forgive the generalisation, I acknowledge not all from this generation are conservative, simply an example) and other hardcore conservatives, or the advancement of rational and critical thinking, I recognise that nothing will change until people change the way they think. My question is, how can the way people see the world be changed? What steps can be undertaken to assist this process and what might be some of the immediate and long term results from such changes?

There are many parts to the United States Constitution that come under constant scrutiny in conversations between both every day citizens and within the courts. Take, for example, the Second Amendment. Some argue that under the Second Amendment, citizens have the right to own and carry weapons. Others point out that the language of the framers’ time is much different from ours, and they meant for the right to bear arms to be granted to militias, not individuals. However, not all debates stem from what the framers put in the Constitution. Topics such as marriage equality or abortion rights were not matters of importance in the late 18th century, so they are not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. Another one of these issues that is not in the Constitution is privacy. Nowhere in the Constitution are citizens explicitly granted the right to privacy. However, while privacy rights are not explicitly granted, they are alive in the First, Third and Fourth Amendments.

THE FIRST AMENDMENT
The First Amendment states “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” By guaranteeing citizens the freedom to exercise religion, the Constitution is granting the right to privacy of beliefs. However, in Reynolds v. United States (1878), it was ruled that laws “cannot interfere with mere beliefs and opinions, they may with practices.” This interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause remained until the 1960s, when the Court began to broaden their interpretation of the clause. For example, Sherbert v. Verner (1963) established the Sherbert Test. For an individual who claims their right to free exercise has been violated by the government, that an individual must prove two things: their religious beliefs are sincere and government action taken against them has become significant burden on their ability to act on their beliefs. If the individual is able to substantiate their claims, the government must then prove it acted out of “compelling state interest” and that it strove to act in the least restrictive manner possible when they impeded on the individual’s freedom of exercise. Finally, in Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith (1990), the Supreme Court held that “Neutral laws of general applicability do not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.”

THE THIRD AMENDMENT
The Third Amendment deals with the quartering of troops. It says, “No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.” Once thought a necessity in post-Revolutionary America, this amendment seems to have little to do with today’s society. In fact, the Supreme Court has never heard a case specifically regarding the Third Amendment. Nonetheless, the right of the people to deny housing to soldiers during peacetime is a matter of privacy. By giving the people this right, they are given the right to live in privacy, without the fear of military or government intrusion. Justice William Douglas argued to extend the Third Amendment to include police investigation of private matters in his dissenting opinion of Poe v. Ullman (1961). The plaintiffs in Poe were challenging a Connecticut state law that banned the use of contraceptives and banned doctors from recommending their use. The plaintiffs lost on the grounds that the law had never been enforced so it was not ripe to be challenged on its constitutionality. In Justice Douglas’ dissenting opinion, he asks, “Can there be any doubt that a Bill of Rights that in a time of peace bars soldiers from being quartered in a home ‘without the consent of the owner’ should also bar the police from investigating the intimacies of the marriage relation?” Poe was overturned by Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), which held that the Connecticut law banning contraceptives violated the right to marital privacy. Justice Douglas delivered the majority opinion and again argued that the Third Amendment was a “facet” of privacy. He stated that the Third Amendment, along with the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments, institute “zones of privacy,” which included marriage and their right to use contraceptives.

THE FOURTH AMENDMENT
The Fourth Amendment grants “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” This amendment tends to deal with due process of the law. For instance, under the Fourth Amendment, the police are prohibited from searching a suspect’s home without first obtaining a warrant from a neutral judge. To get the warrant, the police must offer probable cause for wanting to search the suspect’s home. They must also, according to the Fourth Amendment, “particularly [describe] the place to searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” Originally, the Supreme Court interpreted the Fourth Amendment to protect locations, such as a house or the body, from unwarranted search and seizure. In Olmstead v. United States (1928), the Court held that a warrant was not needed for wiretaps if it were not in the home. Katz v. United States (1967) overturned Olmstead when the Court ruled “The Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.” So established was the “reasonable expectation of privacy” test. Police must obtain a warrant if they wish to monitor conversations that the suspect believes to be private. Two prominent cases deal with this “reasonable expectation of privacy.” In the first, California v. Greenwood (1988), the Court ruled that garbage bags set out on the curb for pickup are adequately exposed to the public so that the expectation of privacy is no longer reasonable. But in Kyllo v. United States (2001), the court determined that police had crossed the line when they used thermal imaging results of Kyllo’s home to get a search warrant for marijuana. The Court held that Kyllo had a reasonable expectation of privacy from surveillance carried out by equipment not commonly used.
Most searches and seizures require a probable cause. There are, however, instances that the Supreme Court has ruled that police do not need to meet this standard. These include stop and frisk policies, as ruled constitutional in Terry v. Ohio (1968) and Minnesota v. Dickerson (1993). Terry established that officers may stop and frisk a person based on experience, but not probable cause, when searching for weapons. In Minnesota, they held that an officer may seize contraband, not only weapons, during a pat down if the contraband is apparent through the suspect’s clothes. Airports may search passengers without probable cause because of the risk of hijacking. Other searches for which probable cause is not required are sobriety checkpoints, consent searches, drug testing of government employees involved in public safety, and student searches, though probable cause is needed to conduct a search on school grounds. 
The exclusionary rule is quite important when it comes to the Fourth Amendment. The rule says that evidence gathered during an illegal search must be excluded in court. Exceptions to the rule can be applied if the officers conducting the search can prove they were acting in good faith (they were under the impression that the warrant they are executing is legal), or if they can prove that they would have found the tainted evidence even if they had been acting independently of the unwarranted search.
The Fourth Amendment also prevents police from executing what is known as a “dragnet.” A dragnet is a warrantless, vacuum-style tactic that police can use in hopes of catching criminals. Dragnet surveillance refers to the monitoring of hundreds or even thousands of conversations. There is no specific target in a dragnet, just the hopes of catching someone doing something illegal. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) was specifically designed to curb the use of dragnet surveillance by the government. FISA established that if the government wished to spy on an individual, they had to be given the go-ahead by the FISA Court. The court was instituted specifically for granting or denying requests to spy on an individual. The government had to establish probable cause for the surveillance, and had to be very specific about the person they were spying on and the means through which they would be conducting the surveillance. In 2008, the Bush administration amended FISA in the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA) to get rid of many of the limitations established by the original FISA. The case which challenges the constitutionality of FAA, Clapper v. Amnesty International et. al. (2012) will be heard on October 29, 2012.

Here is why I ask. I am a former Marine, Iraq vet, college educated middle class white male. I voted for Bush once, and Obama twice. I also Own guns. I used to be a member of the NRA but left because I couldn’t take all the “They’re gonna terk yur guns!” mantra. I was actually quite happy to vote for democrat because to me, they were more rational and realistic on most domestic and international issues, read that as: less hawkish on war / less about trickledown econ AND up until now, I felt that my ability to go buy any gun I wanted (as shooting/marksmanship is a hobby of mine) was safe even under the so called liberal overlords (you know…. Just in case the DNC is listening) ::shifty eyes::

I think that many centrist people like myself that had in the past or maybe even more recently started to see Democrats as a very attractive option, might actually start having second thoughts about throwing much support their way.

Long story short does the following assertion hold true?:

The officer is successfully extradicted from the country he was stationed in. He is now in a holding cell in The Hague.

Since the US doesn't recognize the ICCs authority, they'll say that he has been kidnapped and illigaly detained against his will. The US uses political pressure to release him at first. But lets say the ICC doesn't release the officer. 

The president then decides to launch a military operation in The Hague. A fleet moves into the North Sea or the Canal and launches a small scale attack. Although the rescue is successful, there are casualties on the Dutch defender side.

How will world leaders respond? Considering:

1: Both Nations are part of NATO.

2: The Netherlands lies in the heartland of Europe.

3: The Netherlands is one of the founding nations of the EU.

3: The ICC is recognized 121 states worldwide.

AFAICS this idea is officially endorsed by Israel, the PLO, the UN, the US and most European countries. However, I don't understand how it can work and am wondering why it is so broaldy supported.

For Israel:

* this solution would not guarantee safety, there is no reason to assume rocket attacks will not simply continue
* giving up part of Jeruzalem would be an unacceptable consequence
* any democratic Palestinian state would probably be led by Hamas, which Israel won't negotiate with

For the Palestinians:

* there would be no right of return and probably no compensation for lands lost (unless separately arranged)
* there would be little reason to assume something like the Gaza war could not happen again if rockets continue to be fired
* it is unclear whether Palestine could sustain the influx of refugees returning
* a partitioned territory with holes due to settlements would not likely result in a viable state
* the state of Palestine would be in many ways like the South African homelands, permanently creating a situation of apartheid

Given these problems, ISTM the only fair and lasting solution seems to be a one-state solution for both Jews and Arabs. This way, neither would have to give up any territory and any terrorism could be effectively fought by the police of that one state. It would also provide freedom of movement for all Palistinians and hence better economic opportinities. Also, it would be much easier to implement a right of return in some form.

I guess there would be some concerns such as voting rights, but if for example Jews and Arabs as groups both get 50% of the voting rights there is no need for Palestinians to fear Jewish immigration or for Jews to fear Arab reproduction. Symbolic issues such as the name or flag of the state should also be fixable. I can imagine for example naming this state ""the holy land"", a phrase that should be acceptable to both sides. The flag could either include symbols for all religions or for none of them.

So my question: what makes the two-state solution so appealing to states and international organizations? Do they genuinely believe it can work?

My first contention is that America is a historically white country and that letting mass immigration will result in more optional segregation and increased racial tensions in the future.  Why do I think this? Because when a huge amount of poor minorities enter a country, they aren't going to be integrating with the white middle class Americans, they are all going to live in their own poor neighborhoods.  I believe that the best immigration policy to where we get educated people with work visas over here. 


My second contention is that it reduces the strength of unions, both because of more cheap labor but also because ethnically diverse workforces tend to produce weak unions. Not only that, but immigration lowers wages of those workers employed in the lowest paid jobs, and it also leads to heavy youth unemployment.  


I'm pretty left wing, and I believe we should strongly enforce our borders, crack down on illegal immigrants, and select the most educated immigrants to come here.  Why is this not a left wing idea?

While we have raised a fair amount of money, we are still behind 4-1 cash on hand. Thankfully, one of my strong suits in other campaigns is raising money, so I feel confident that I can get at least $250,000 in the door. 

So, I'm wondering what has worked/has failed badly for all of you when you were in a long shot. I have won several races as a manager before, but we always started off at around even or better. So while I feel good about knowing the nuts and bolts of campaigns, what have you seen work to move the needle considerably in a situation like this?",,False,,t5_2t160,False,,,True,t3_1efocy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1efocy/how_to_win_a_longshot_district/,

I understand the HoR and Senate but nfi about the Electoral College.

I should really say, how do you guys even pick electors? Is it voted by the general public? I've read something about conventions and the states pick them or something?

btw, this is not homework, I've been wondering about this for the past year without any concrete confirmation on one specific system.

edit:

I'm asking more specifically in terms of how those electors are selected and how they actually win. Are the electors on the ballot? or do you vote for one party in your district and you automatically vote for that parties elector? Cali has 55 electoral votes but 53 are based on HoR reps and 2 are based on senators, 53 will be in the districts so if dems win say 26 districts and republicans win 26 districts, so the deciding factor will come down to the 2 last senator electoral college votes.

so how are the 2 senatorial electoral college votes decided? 

Now, are there 55 nominated democrat electors and 55 nominated republican electors? or are they all independent and have to vote whoever wins popular vote? I've read in a couple places that say that party national conventions vote nominate electors. So if thats the case unless state laws specific say winner takes all, can't a state say have 8 votes and have 4 republican electoral votes and 4 democrat votes?

I just finished reading the first 10 pages of the CISPA law, available here:

http://rules.house.gov/media/file/PDF_112_2/LegislativeText/CPRT-112-HPRT-RU00-HR3523.pdf

Upon reviewing several posts on Reddit regarding the CISPA law I was initially surprised at the alarm the mention of this bill in Washington has caused. I read several articles about the law but was not satisfied with the meat they were providing, so I took the initiative to look up the law myself.

I am not familiar with citing legal documents, so if you would bear with me into this inquiry, I would like to direct your attention to the top of page 4 of the law, beginning on line 1: 

""‘‘(b) USE OF CYBERSECURITY SYSTEMS AND SHAR-
ING OF CYBER THREAT INFORMATION.—"" 

The indication seems clear to me that no corporate or utilities entity is legaly obliged to engage with this information sharing with the Federal Government.

Now go to page 5, line 6, entitled:

""(2) SHARING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERN-
MENT.—""

This is where the good meat is.

The law begins to state that upon requesting information from a corporate or utilities entity, the entity can do things like make anonymous tons of information.

Now please look at page 6, line 6 entitled:
 
""(3) USE AND PROTECTION OF INFORMA-
7 TION.—""

The law begins to state EXPLICITLY that the Federal Government is barred from using any information gathered for any purposes outside the framework of the CISPA legislation, which of course, is to prevent classified information from being collected by unauthorized sources.

I hope you are satisfied with my interpretation of the law. I voted my first time last November, and do not yet regret it.
If you object to my interpretation of the law, this thread will then serve its purpose for further inquiry, and legitimate sources directing the conversation one way or the other.

Thank you Reddit!

I would just like to take a moment to give remembrance for the thousands that died on a field of battle one hundred and fifty years ago.  In this age of hyper partisan politics and a Congress less popular than just about everything, I feel this is a good time to remind folks that things can still get worse.  The longer we allow our political players to stand, shaking their fist at someone else while blaming them for all the problems the closer we get to forgetting this horrific event in our past.

Here is the thing.  We are all Americans and I love you all as such and would stand by you against any threat to this great nation.  I may disagree with you on many issues, but the one where I draw the line is that I believe with all of my heart that we have a fundamental right to disagree and debate.  Please remember this next time you decide to berate another for their view.  Take a moment.  Take a breath.  Think about whether there is one iota of a chance that statement is going to change anyone's mind.  Go out there and disagree to your hearts content.  But always remember that hand you are about to slap may be the one picking you up off the ground tomorrow.

May this great nation shine for as long as there are people alive to see that light.  Last I would like to post [this link](http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm) with words that say this far better than I ever could.

What are you getting with those taxes?

* Roads are maintained\built and paid for by city, county, and state taxes.
* Police departments are paid for by city, county, and state taxes.
* Fire departments are paid for by city, county, and state taxes.
* Public Education is paid for paid for by city, county, and state taxes.

Of the four previously mentioned items, federal taxes pay for less than 15% of each. 

In the case of public education, feds contribute roughly 10%, we spend more than any other industrialized nation, and yet we score incredibly low in math and science.

Police and other essential services are funded at local levels, with federal funding only being provided for initiatives like ""Click-it or Ticket"", or other federal grants which end up going to military grade armament of these organizations.

Transportation, likewise, is funded by states. You will have an occasional deviation from this wherein multiple states want to partner together to fund a new highway, but again, that is multiple states, and not federal involvement.

ACA is in no way a single-payer healthcare solution, so that covers healthcare.

In all the discussions about taxation in the US this option rarely comes up and I don't understand why it isn't consideration as a viable solution to the question of how capital gains are taxed.

If everyone had a million dollar lifetime limit the vast majority of people would never reach it and it would minimally affect those who sell a small business they built, a house they owned, or a stock they invested in.  However, for those who make insane amounts of money but pay very low rates as their income is classified as capital gains, real taxation could then be recouped.

I am curious if ask_politics sees this as viable policy and if not, why not?  Is it simply a question of political willingness or are there legitimate concerns about the effects of such a policy.

It came down to the moment when Eylon Aslan-Levy began talking about Israel in terms of 'we'.

At that point is it justified to refuse to continue with the debate as the speaker is personally identifying with the group the motion concerns and therefore cannot be dispassionate in their arguments?

My suggestions:

1. Allow free and easy unlimited access to credit reports and credit scores. IMO, something that's as vital to every American's financial lives should not be tied up in the hands of three for-profit companies. Yes, I realize that anyone can go to annualcreditreport.com and get one free copy a year from each of the three bureaus (which everyone should do, if you haven't already), but we should be able to access it every month at least, or better yet at any time, since it has such an effect on our financial lives (credit, mortgage rates, jobs, etc). Sometimes something might pop up there that you wouldn't even know about unless you pay to check your report. I believe things should be more transparent--and this includes the credit scores, including FICO--their formula for determining how credit worthy people are is kept secret--and as the FICO score is the most widely used score out there, nobody can be for sure what is the best course of action for them in regards to improving their credit. A couple of states already require free access to credit reports year round. I realize sites like creditkarma.com and creditsesame.com also exist, but honestly they aren't the same. I still only get my once per year per bureau allowance of free reports--if I want my information to be updated beyond a month, I have to pay for new reports (or a program from Transunion and the like that will give it to me, for $15 a month). My information on CreditSesame is currently 136 days old right now, fixable only by paying $9 for another report. Apparently the score on CreditKarma is their own estimate of what your score should be, and is thus effectively useless, as a difference of a few points in your true score can make a world of difference when it comes to loan rates.
Push for more privacy restrictions on Social Security Numbers. Not every outfit out there should be able to even ask for your SSN (as businesses are already inclined to use it as an identifier, and people are inclined to give it out). Obviously, there are necessary uses for this--e.g. banks need to prove that you are who you say you are--but (and this is a rare case) my high school used SSNs as an ID number, meaning it was printed on your ID card. This is probably more difficult to implement, however, as many businesses/operations already use SSNs, so there will almost assuredly be some pushback (and rightfully so), but I believe a compromise can be arranged.

2. Get rid of the backscatter body scanners in airports--and preferably the millimeter wave ones as well. I know Rapiscan is having their backscatter machines removed, but American Science and Engineering backscatter machines will remain, with their ionizing radiation. Those machines, as well as the millimeter wave machines, will still take a 'nude' image of travelers, but they will overlay a stick-figure like image showing any potential 'problem' areas. At the very least, the ionizing backscatters are the worst of the worst, and should be removed. MM-waves are hardly any better, but ideally I'd like to see a whole revamp of the TSA--less fondling and a return to metal detectors. The body scanners are terribly expensive, about $180,000 each, and now some of them are being canned after less than three years into deployment. But a small victory of sorts would be if we can completely get rid of the backscatter body scanners, which pretty much nobody likes and do the same function as a millimeter-wave scanner (though getting rid of the 'requirement' for the body scanner imaging itself is a more medium term goal).

3. Pretty niche, but finally give a Presidential Permit for the construction of a new bridge[1] between the US and Canada in Detroit. Currently a quarter of all trade between the US and Canada crosses the dilapidated, privately owned 80 year old Ambassador bridge two miles to the north. Currently, one man, named Matty Maroun, owns the most important bridge in North America. The new bridge would be publicly owned and Canada would pay the entire $4 billion cost--including paying for Michigan's $550 million share. The bridge would cost Michigan nothing, and in fact would qualify it for $2 billion in federal matching funds for road improvements across the state. Currently, 8,000 trucks daily pass through 18 stop lights and residential neighborhoods on the Canadian side after crossing the Ambassador Bridge, and the people there are sick of it. The importance of the crossing to trade cannot be understated--car factories and suppliers on both sides of the border use just in time inventory and a vehicle can cross the border seven times before it is finally completed. The Prime Minister of Canada has stated that new bridge is Canada's number one infrastructure priority[2] . The bridge has heavy backing, from the car companies to chambers of commerce across the region The funding, approvals, and plans are in place, all that's needed for construction to begin is a Presidential Permit.

**The scenario:** A few years ago, Party 1 had a majority in both houses of Congress and the Presidency, and they passed a package of laws. Party 2 was and is very much opposed to this package of laws. 

Over the next few years, Party 1 lost control of the House, but retained control of the Senate and Presidency. The package of laws (or some component therein) was challenged at the Supreme Court and found to be constitutional. While the House (controlled by Party 2) passes a repeal to the law, the Senate (controlled by party 1) refuses, and the President would veto it if it made it to his desk. (Normally this is where opposition efforts cease.) 

Since all the above methods of repealing the law failed, Party 2 decides to do a government shutdown to prevent implementation (funding) of the law. They state that they're going to maintain their shutdown until the Senate passes a bill repealing the law and the President (both of Party 1) signs it. 

**My question is this:** What accountability is there for members of the House that do an indefinite government shutdown? If the President and Senate don't back down, does the government grind to a halt for up to two years? If the status quo of party control remains after the next election, does it continue for another two years after that? 

It's assumed that public opinion would force one of the sides to back down, but if public opinion is divided along the lines of the government with both sides feeling strongly... how does the situation end? Is there the means (via the Attorney General, Sergeant at Arms, or someone else) to force an end to a government shutdown, forcing the House to vote on funding bills, or no? 

**Another angle to ask the question:** If a President does something that Congress can frame as 'high crimes &amp; misdemeanors', impeachment by Congress and presided over by the head of the Supreme Court is an option. If one or more members of the Supreme Court goes wild, there's impeachment or removal (can't remember) by Congress. But what recourse is there when a majority in one of the two houses of Congress goes bad? If both parties dig in their heels, does a shutdown really go on indefinitely until the voters vote in a different group?

So they aren't being jailed for not paying.  They are being jailed for *contempt of court* (that's what happens when you don't show up).

A moral inconsistency, I guess you would call it.  One point against gun control I often hear is, ""people kill people, not guns, and these people will find a way to do it no matter what the law is.""  I'm an independent, but most closely aligned with libertarian views.  I think that drugs should be legal, and I'm not going to get into the nitty gritty of that, because it's an entirely separate talking point.  However, when I mention this notion and all of the rational support behind it, every one of my Republican friends jumps out and says ""No! You can't have everyone getting addicted to heroin, what are you crazy?!""  One point behind my opinion is that people who wish to dangerous drugs will do so anyway; if they don't have regard for their own personal health what regard do they have for the law?  To this point, my Republican friends disagree emphatically, despite the fact that allowing people to go get high as they wish poses no serious threat to anybody other than the user, except for maybe a burden on their family.  Anyone who dies of drugs does so at their own hand.  So how can they be so quick to disagree with the notion of legalizing drugs, yet turn around say ""crazy people will kill people anyway, so why make a law to stop them from getting guns?""  This makes no sense to me.  They don't see  a point in implementing law that seeks to prevent perfectly innocent people from dying (for the sake of their ""rights""), yet have no problem whatsoever spending billions a year on preventing people from doing something that can only directly harm themselves.

There has been a suggestion by Bernie Sanders to raise the input cap to $250,000 - seems reasonable, it probably hasn't gone up since Reagan was in office. This would give SS lots of additional income and allow it to stay solvent for many more years. There has been no mention of raising the payout cap. Maybe it's assumed.

Some updates.  

I met with the Wilco Dems (Williamson County Democratic Party) I'm sure I didn't make a good impression on them, but I went there with a ton of questions hoping to get some answers.  Instead, I only ended up with more questions and a sense that the party (locally, at least) was extremely disorganized. 

But after talking with one of the Precinct Captains, I came to realise that, no, I'm not a bad candidate.  I just need help with the stuff that the Democratic Party is supposed to help their candidates with. 

In truth, that's why I think I can win.  I've looked at the numbers, and I think that I can win if I play the political equivilant of Moneyball.  There are certain issues, approaches, and voters that the Democratic Party undervalues for various reasons in the conventional wisdom.  I think they're wrong, and I think that I can pick up a lot of those votes, which combined with traditional GOTV efforts, would put me over the top of my opponent. 

I'm facing a primary challenger - possibly several - but I think I can out-raise them and out-debate them.  

The official sign-up is in December.  What do I need to be doing now in the ""pre-season"" if it were?

I will be entering my second year of political science in September and because of this I am starting to do some background reading on international relations theories as they will be one of the subjects I will studying coming semester.

However, I have been having difficulty finding where to begin. There are a surprisingly large amount of international relations theories and I am unsure of what are normally considered the mainstream ones.

I know Realism and Neo-Realism will be looked at extensively as a response to Idealism and that Liberalism and Neo-Liberalism will also be covered. I know a certain amount about both Realism and Liberalism and a decent amount about Marxism. 

Nevertheless, within these streams there are many substreams and I am looking for a (free) book or website where they are explained in a rudimentary fashion so I can have a broad outline of them before I get into the more intensive books and articles on the subjects.

Some of the theories I have come across are:
•	Critical Theory
•	Positivism
•	Constructivism
•	Post-structuralism
•	Interdependence theory
•	Feminist theory

The wikipedia entries can be useful but are often filled with contradictions and definitions used interchangably and thus I am looking for more reputable sources. If possible all gathered together ;)

I mean, who can't pass that up?

But there was this gem that I hadn't even thought of, regarding immigration reform:

&gt;Maybe the greedy businessmen now running the Republican Party should talk with their Hispanic maids sometime. Ask Juanita if she'd like to have seven new immigrants competing with her for the opportunity to clean other people's houses, so that her wages can be dropped from $20 an hour to $10 an hour.

I think I follow the logic.  Those currently here illegally cannot charge the same amount for their services as those legally - simply in an economic sense, using an illegal carries a risk of fine/trouble with the government, therefore *some* sort of discount is going to be enforced in using that illegal labor.  Even if the nominal pay to the employee is the same ($20/hr, to use the example), economic theory states that the employer was willing to pay ~7% more, roughly the employer side of the income tax.  Buy using the illegals, the owner saves that $1.40 an hour he would have otherwise been willing to incur.

Seems to me that it won't just be limited to Hispanics, as Coulter suggests, but also to all those working on the low-end of the wage later.  To nest that in economic terms, if the demand of something remains constant, but the supply increases, the price will lower itself until a new equilibrium is reached.

But I feel I'm missing something here... or are politics more hell-bent on getting ""immigration reform"" than thinking through the ramifications of the new law.  The jaded part of me wants to say the latter, but I do hope that it isn't true.

ETA: Now that I think it through, would it bring down more than just low-skill wages.

Any insights or related articles are welcome.

I have only a naive perspective on this, but I'll share it so you know where I'm coming from. 

For any given product, there seems to be tens or hundreds of cheap knockoff products available from Chinese producers, in many cases for &lt;25% the original's price. For most everyday items, the loss in quality is negligible (going by personal experience). Is this a result of less market regulation via patents and the like? It seems they can't inflate prices or use inefficient methods because in no time they'd be undercut by competitors' clones. In the US you hear about start-ups bought-out or sued to oblivion, and it's not up to consumers to choose the product that consumers prefer.

Put simply: could prisoners be allowed to kill themselves, using state-offered methods (a pill to be taken in their own time with food, for example)? I envisage this to be given with sentencing, as an option to take instead of a life sentence.

Pros: the financial drain on the state from those serving life sentences in prison is reduced. Death Row theoretically becomes much less bureaucratic. 

Of course, the prisoner's suicide could be seen as an escape from punishment, but how is this ultimately different from spending years on death row? Since the death penalty is meant to be a deterrent rather than a means of revenge.

Why not treat guns like automobiles? In order to drive a car, we have to take and pass a test for a basic license to drive as well as have insurance. If I want to ride a motorcycle, in many states I have to take and pass an additional test. If I want to drive an 18-wheeler or other heavy-load vehicle I need to have a commercial drivers license. Why not do the same thing for firearms of all, ahem, ""caliber.""

Example: If someone wants to buy a pistol, up to say a .22 or nine-millimeter semi-automatic, or perhaps as far up as .45, or even bolt action rifles and shotguns (such as for hunting), then they are required to take and pass a basic handgun safety test. If someone wishes to own, say an SKS, or AR-15 or equivalent, or even an AK-47, then they have to take and pass an advanced weapons safety test.

In addition, why shouldn't there be firearm insurance to cover medical expenses as a result of accidents (negligent discharges, etc....)? The bigger the weapon, the higher the premium.

(All pre-existing background checks/regulation remain in place)

With this model, gun enthusiasts would still be able to own firearms of their choosing, but would also be trained in their proper use, care, and storage catered toward the weapon they choose to own.

The biggest problem with firearms in the country, statistically, is accidents resulting from a lack of education of safety principles. Naturally testing is not an cure-all, but perhaps it could introduce the concept of firearm safety and education into the culture...

Who pays for that cap, how is it appropriated, and what happens when a family's income rises above 400% FPL. (do all protections relating to OOP expenses cease?)",christ0ph,8,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/15dr8q/a_question_on_the_affordable_care_acts_95_cap_on/,"I have a few questions about the cap on Out of Pocket Costs. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PPACA_Premium_Chart.jpg for an image of the values for people up to 400% FPL)

1.) Who pays for the difference between the costs and the cap value? Does that money come from the federal government or the states and how is it appropriated? (Will it be subjected to a new battle over appropriations every year.)

2.) Assuming (from the chart) that the cap on Out of Pocket Costs is 9.5% of a family's income for somebody with a income 399% of the Federal Poverty Line, what is the Out of Pocket Cost Maximum for somebody earning 401% of the Federal Poverty Line? (is it still 9.5%, is it capped at any other level, or is there no cap ?) 

Often when people have chronic illnesses or when they are suddenly diagnosed with a serious illness, out of pocket costs can be unexpectedly high even for people with excellent insurance. Generally, the less comprehensive the insurance is, the higher the uncovered costs. Paradoxically, those with the lowest ability to buy ""gold plated"" plans (sick people) often have the biggest need for the better kinds of insurance. 

Currently, many (state) programs supply so called ""high risk pool"" insurance to people who have health problems when they are not able to get into a high quality group plan. 

But that insurance tends to be way too expensive for many people who need it. In other states the cost is lower, but there are waiting lists or in some cases, even lotteries to get into the programs. (Generally the high risk pools lose money.) 

Other states don't offer such programs at all. The people who cannot access any kind of insurance now are the people who seem to be in danger of falling through the cracks of the ACA as well. 

Many currently cannot buy insurance at any cost- and although they will in theory be able to buy it under the ACA, (or be exempted if the cost is too high, remaining uninsured.) its debatable whether they will be able to afford to be insured without a cap on OOP costs, even if they are making higher incomes than the 400%

Chronically ill people are the ones who are the group of people who often these programs are most needed to help, their need for insurance is the big weakness of the American system, (which was rated in one recent study to be the worst developed country in the world to become chronically ill in.) 

If this weakness exists for this crucial group, and the ACA is trying to obscure this failing without trying to address it for the people who currently are uninsured - that is fundamentally dishonest. It begs the question, what exactly is the ACA intended to do then, if it fails in what many healthcare experts described as what should have been our primary mission.

My worry is many folk who have chronic conditions will find that they have no choice but to remain uninsured under the ACA because the combination of high uncovered costs and high premiums will continue to be be too much for them. The cap on OOP costs is potentially a very valuable benefit for some people, one they will really need, because otherwise, the OOP costs in some lower costs plans can exceed income - currently in many plans, there is no limit.

The test will be I think if families with a child or self-employed wage earner who gets hit with a major illness - perhaps they've bought a family plan partially subsidized by the ACA when they are in the 2nd quintile and have the cap, then one year they earn enough to put them into the 3rd or 4th quintiles of income - can remain insured and remain able to afford the OOP costs - even if the illness is a serious one..

Also, quality of care is a major concern. Currently, aghast at gag clauses and restrictions on the treatments they give by HMOs many of the better doctors are dropping out of the insurance system. It will be a serious problem if our healthcare system for those who most need it is limited to being accepted by only a few doctors. In Canada, and almost every other developed country, all doctors are ""in network""

1355159614.0,7,self.Ask_Politics,14m18a,Official Subreddit Rules,karmanaut,35,28,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/14m18a/official_subreddit_rules/,"I. Submissions

Every submission in /r/ask_politics must be:

* An actual question

* A Policy Proposal
 
* A [META] post
   
* An AMA post

* A special occasion post

Questions are just that: questions. Users should make every effort to ensure that their questions are clear, specific and novel. The more tightly-focused your question, the more likely you are to get an answer. 

[META] posts are about the state and process of the subreddit; e.g. ""[META] We need to talk about downvotes""; ""[META] We now have 40,000 subscribers!""; etc. Anyone may make a [META] post. Please only make such posts about things that actually invite or require discussion.

AMA posts are mod-approved ""ask me anything"" submissions from flaired users, along the same lines as those featured in /r/IAmA. In these submissions, the user in question makes him- or herself available to answer questions provided by our readers about the user's area of expertise. Only flaired users may make AMA posts, and only with mod approval.

Special occasion posts draw attention to an occurrence or anniversary that would serve as good grounds for general discussion. Such posts can be about anniversaries of policies beginning or ending, historical events that sparked a political change, etc. -- anything that's a legitimately big deal and likely to be of interest to /r/ask_politics' readers. Anyone can make a special occasion post, but only after receiving mod approval.

If a submission in /r/ask_politics does not fit into one of these categories, it will very likely be deleted.

II. Commenting

There are two types of comments: top-tiered and non-top-tiered. Each type of comment is governed by different rules.

II(a). Top-Tiered Comments

Top-tiered comments should only be serious responses to whatever the thread is about. If it's a question, they must be answers; if an AMA, solid questions; if one of the other types, worthwhile points of discussion. In all cases, it is permitted to ask additional questions to clarify the OP's submission or to follow it up.

Memes, jokes, insults, or other unhelpful comments are not permitted, though exceptions may be made for jokes if they are only part of an otherwise informative comment. The answers provided in /r/ask_politics should be informed, comprehensive, serious and courteous -- that is, they should be such that a reader would depart feeling as though he or she had actually learned something.

Sources in top-tiered comments are not an absolute requirement at first if the comment is sufficiently comprehensive, but users who choose to answer questions in /r/ask_politics must take responsibility for the answers they provide. If you are asked for sources or further substantiation, you are required to make a good-faith effort to find and provide them. This subreddit's entire point is to answer questions that are set before you; if you are not prepared or inclined to substantiate your claims when asked, please think twice before answering in the first place.

Partisan bickering and name calling is not welcome in this subreddit. If you came here to score political points or to parrot unsourced talking points, your comments will be removed. Repeat offenders will be banned. 

II(b). Non-Top-Tiered Comments

Comments that are not in the top-tier are less restricted.

Non-top-tiered comments should still have a positive purpose -- if they exist for no other reason than to insult someone they will still be deleted. Nevertheless, non-top-tiered comments have greater scope for jokes, digressions and so on, and will be moderated with a somewhat lighter hand.

II(c). On Speculation

We welcome informed, helpful answers from any users equipped to provide them, whether they have flair or not. Nevertheless, while this is a public forum it is not an egalitarian one; not all answers will be treated as having equal merit. Please ensure that you only post answers that you can substantiate, if asked, and only when you are certain of their accuracy.

It is perfectly acceptable to ask a follow-up question of your own if you aren't sure about something, or wish to generate further discussion, but please make sure to frame your comment explicitly in those terms if so.

II(d). Posts from Novelty Accounts and Bots

Bots will be banned on sight, no matter how benign. We are not interested in 'em.

Users may post from novelty accounts provided they do not do so ""in-character."" This applies both to accounts with a particular gimmick (only posts one word, gradually revealed to be something, etc.) or accounts intentionally modeled upon famous persons. In-character posting will result first in a ban.

III. Flair

Flair is for users with an extensive knowledge of a given topic area. Until categories of flair are established, we will essentially allow experts to pick what text their flair will display. 

III(a). Applying for Flair

To apply for the flair, simply message the moderators [here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAsk_Politics) and ask. In order to be flaired, you must prove that you currently are or have formerly worked in the field of politics, or that you have studied it academically. Acceptable proof would include ID badges or paystubs, degrees or other certificates, etc. Anything that proves your claims. All proof sent to the moderators will remain 100% confidential, under any circumstances.

III(b). Flaired Expectations

Users with flair must have two things:

* An extensive knowledge of their topic area, with the ability to cite sources on anything they say in that topic area.

* The ability to convey their personal knowledge and experiences in a way that is understandable to a person unfamiliar with politics.

Flaired users are held to a higher standard. They must be polite, helpful, and comprehensive in every comment they make. They are permitted to answer questions outside of their area of expertise, but they will be treated just like any other user when they do so.

Flaired users who fail to meet the above expectations should be reported to the moderators.

III(c). Non-Flaired Expectations

We welcome the participation of non-flaired users so long as it conforms to all of the above rules. It is especially important for us to allow such participation given that it is one of the chief ways in which we can find out which non-flaired users should be given flair at all. Nevertheless, pay special attention to the strictures provided above when it comes to sources and speculation.

III(d). Conduct for All Users

Regardless of flair, all users are expected to behave with courtesy and charity. We also have a very low tolerance for racism, sexism, or other forms of bigotry, no matter your credentials.

IV. Discipline

Those who break the rules outlined above will likely find themselves under scrutiny. Disciplinary actions on the moderators' part come in three forms:

* Gentle reminders
   
* Formal warnings
    
* Bannings

Gentle reminders will see a moderator suggesting you shift your tone, improve your posting style, or what have you, but without any suggestion of the matter being especially severe.

Formal warnings will be delivered for especially grievous infractions, and are marked by their inclusion of a serious, declarative command; e.g. ""Do not post like this again."" Users who receive multiple warnings will likely be banned.

Bannings are reserved for users who:

* Commit multiple infractions in spite of warnings and correction

* Respond with hostility and rudeness to attempts to warn them (**note: this does not mean you can't respond at all; we're quite open to being asked why warnings or reminders have been handed out -- just be courteous about it!)
 
* Are clearly trolls

* Engage unrepentantly in racist, sexist, or otherwise bigoted behaviour

* Are spammers

* Are bots -- even relatively benign ones

IV(b). Appeals

If one of your comments has been wrongfully deleted, or if you feel you have been wrongfully banned, you can message the moderators either individually or as a team to explain your situation.

These rules are subject to change at any time, though such changes will be publicly announced. Questions should be directed toward the mod mail.

In the meantime, any immediate comments are welcome below.

I'm from England but go to university in the USA and one of my friends just shared a thread that presents some facts. I'm not entirely sure if they are facts or not and I'd like to get some other people's views on them.


Last month, the Senate Budget Committee reports that in fiscal year 2012, between food stamps, housing support, child care, Medicaid and other benefits, the average U.S. Household below the poverty line received $168.00 a day in government support. What's the problem with that much support? Well, the median household income in America is just over $50,000,which averages out to $137.13 a day. To put it another way, being on welfare now pays the equivalent of $30.00 an hour for a 40-hour week, while the average job pays $20.00 an hour.
Furthermore:
There are actually two messages here. The first is very
interesting, but the second is absolutely astounding - and explains a lot.

A recent ""Investor's Business Daily"" article provided very
interesting statistics from a survey by the United Nations International
Health Organization.

Percentage of seniors needing hip replacement who received it

Percentage referred to a medical specialist who see one within

Number of MRI scanners (a prime diagnostic tool) per million

England 14

Canada 18


Percentage of seniors (65+), with low income, who say they are

U.S. 12%

England 2%

Canada 6%


And now for the last statistic:


National Health Insurance?

U.S. NO

England YES

Canada YES

Check this last set of statistics!!

The percentage of each past president's cabinet who had worked in the private business sector prior to their appointment to the cabinet.
You know what the private business sector is; a real-life business, not a government job. Here are the percentages.
T. Roosevelt.................... 38%

Taft................................ 40%

Wilson ........................... 52%

Harding........................... 49%

Coolidge......................... 48%

Hoover............................ 42%

Carter............................. 32%

Reagan............................ 56%

only 8% of them have ever worked in private business!

last 19 presidents! And these people are trying to tell our big
corporations how to run their business?

How can the president of a major nation and society, the one
with the most successful economic system in world history, stand and talk
about business when he's never worked for one? Or about jobs when he has
never really had one? And when it's the same for 92% of his senior staff

After the Cold War we have this ""unipolar moment"" (Krauthammer) and the United States has the potential to pursue a wide ranging number of policy options now that it is unrestrained by the Soviet threat.

Basically what i'm asking is, do you think that there has been a coherent or even incoherent US grand strategy since the end of the Cold War?

Attracting the best talents makes us more competitive on a global scale, right?

However, last year I spent one year in Taiwan to study Chinese and I realized that in this part of the world, they have a very different view on this issue. I have a degree in IT from North America and several years of experience in the industry, and I had the strong impression that they didn't want me to be there. It took me a while to figure out where this generalized resentment was coming from, and my conclusion is that I was seen as a threat for them. I was qualified, motivated, and willing to assimilate myself and learn their language. They probably thought that I was going there to steal one of their jobs, even though my purpose was not to get a job there at all (salaries are ridiculously low).

Once I was back in my country, I came in contact with an Iranian woman in the IT sector. She was offering tutoring services for students at an English-speaking university in the province of Quebec and was not speaking a single word of French. She later found a very decent job as a consultant in the health sector, in association with McGill University, a top institution in Canada.

Now these two realities changed my perception about immigration in Canada. First, there is this double standard where most countries on the planet would not want immigrants in order to protect their local jobs, but that it is okay for Canada to accept everybody with open arms. Second, there are those immigrants who come here with the sole focus on landing a high paying job and don't care to assimilate themselves. I realized that some of them end up choosing a French speaking province such as Quebec because they face less competition here, and that it is totally possible to find a job without knowing French.

Chomsky once mentioned that many economists will say that immigration is a good thing because it increases overall efficiency. However, this turns out to be true only in theory, the realities are oftentimes very different. One reality according to him is that a lot of local workers are losing their jobs in favour of these foreign workers. Another is that a lot of foreign workers end up being exploited.

I would not have a problem with a graduated pro tax that taxed the poor a very small percentage if it taxed the wealthy much more than it does today and made essential services like healthcare and education free to everybody. 

There is a real need for lifelong education because for the kinds of professions which are emerging and growing, there is no road map which can tell people where that profession is going, the most successful companies these days are much like research organizations, they devote a lot of energy to pushing the envelope in new directions and its that process - much like directed play, if you enjoy it, that has proven to be the most powerful way to learn. That kind of learning doesn't have to end at any given age. In fact, if we are to stay competitive as a nation, it *can't*.

*I think there would be little need for welfare if we instead had free lifetime education.* But, for adults, and those who were capable of handling the responsibility, not the kind of structured schooling that most of us think about. **""What if"" when somebody was unemployed, they could choose to go back to school, at any point in their lives?** What if we made that choice really work in an altogether new way - Something that would leverage one of the most unique assets of the United States, its inventive people- to its best advantage.

A new kind of educational institution, call them lifelong universities, could be developed. They could offer a supportive environment where people would be encouraged to devote all their time to developing commercial and community development style ideas - **all kinds of ideas**, into reality. 

These campuses could function as needed, as think tanks to solve specific national problems. They would be encouraged to bring people from different backgrounds and different disciplines together, old and young, rich and poor. (The idea would be that everybody had something they could offer) 

They could even offer (for people who needed them) dormitory style living arrangements. For people involved in technology, they would be much like the ""incubators"" and ""hackerspaces"" that are springing up in many cities, with the exception that to be involved in them, one would have to have a faculty advisor and your learning plan would need to be approved as having merit, and you would need to make progress on it. These schools would endeavor to be real centers of learning for people of all ages. Numerous ideas that people have which could be commercialized could be developed in them People could form companies within this framework which would give them a great deal of support, meeting rooms, access to equipment and advisers, who could be retired businessmen and engineers, as well as people currently working who would devote some portion of their time to community development.

The government and industry would both derive benefits from having this resource available.

This would also offer an opportunity for older people to earn income teaching classes or mentoring younger people, transferring skills. The idea would be to try to replace the current welfare system with this educational world which didn't give people a check, instead it gave them a way to move up in a way which human society had never attempted before in quite this way. I imagine we would really find that these programs bore fruit, really gave people a leg up in the workplace. I think we would also find that many Americans had hidden talents that we would never have otherwise discovered. Also, we could use this program to build up a national database of people and skills to match with one another when they requested such matching.

People could learn, live in their offices (showers and kitchens would be provided) and stay *as long as they made progress on projects than benefited themselves in the future and the community*.  These ""campuses"" would be run, though, with an eye to keeping them on track with their goal of developing new businesses and methods, so fraternity style organizations and collegiate style partying and drinking to excess on campus would be prohibited. (If people wanted to party, they would be required to go elsewhere and not bring the party back to the dorm, out of respect for the fact that it was a place of learning, like a library.)

Married students would be allowed to live together as long as they made progress on their goals and projects. It would not be a place for idleness.

What do people think? I am especially interested in the opinions of conservatives. Note that these institutions would be FOR EVERYBODY and the success of them would depend on a national consensus that they were in a sense a protected, politics free zone where people would join together and work to make our country a better, stronger place economically and socially.
