* **The Big Venue: The Lincoln Theatre** The biggest music bar in Raleigh, though far from the best. They get a really random assortment of bands, from hippie folk to indie rock, it's hard to say what will be at the Lincoln one night to the next. That said, they are the most consistant at booking bands everyone has heard of.
* **The Little Venue: Kings/The Pour House** Kings and Neptunes is split level bar that caters to the indie scene. Not a huge space, but if an up-and-coming act is performing in Raleigh, they are more than likely performing here. If the concert is being put on by the cats cradle, you can bet your ass it's hipster gold. The Pour House is a bit more... hippie? It's got a great scene and works very hard to bring good bands to the triangle.
* **The Townies: Slims/Dive Bar** Both are the hole in the wall bars where you'll get a new best fried and/or stabbed. Slims caters to the local music scene while Dive Bar caters to the heavy metal crowd. Both seem kind of scary from the outside, but are full of very cool people if you've got a thing for townies. 
* **The Gay Bars: The Borough/Legends/Flex** The borough offers LGBT friendly dining. I've never seen that place get crazy nor have I ever felt uncomfortable there for being straight, it's a very friendly experience. Flex and Legends are *very* friendly places, if you catch my meaning. I went to one super drunk and there were drag shows, queens, and much crotch grabbing. Maybe that was just the night I was there, but from what I understand, that's what it's generally like (correct me if I'm wrong)
* **The Beer Garden: Flying Sucer/The Raleigh Times** Both are water holes. The Flying Saucer has hundreds of beers on tap and in bottles, where the Times has a more limited but more interesting selection. Both pride themselves on having ample seating indoors and out, and are great places to mix and mingle. There's not really a specific crowd that haunts either place.
* **I JUST WANT TO DANCE: Mirage/Architecture/Solas/Red Room/The Hive/Neptunes** These are the bars where you go to get down. Loud music and expensive drinks are on order for the evening. If you go to these bars, you know exactly what you're looking for, and you'll find it.
* **Pubs: Tir Na Nog/Landmark Tavern/Mitch's Tavern** Really chill places to get a pint and chill with friends.
* **See and be Scene: Glennwood South/Fayetteville Street** Put on your best outfit, do your hair, and prepare to be judged. Glennwood South and Fayetteville Street are known for their strips of bars. It's a great place to bar hop and you're sure to find the beautiful people here.
* **Billiards/Pool Hall: Buck's Billiards/Snooker's/Pantana Bob's/Sharky's** Although Buck's is technically in Cary it's one of the best place that's close to downtown to play pool, drink decent beer, and be around a good crowd. Snookers is pretty much only centered around Billiards. PB's seems to be as well, granted you tend to get more of the college crowd there prob due to it being on hillsborough st. Oh and there's Sharky's, they just recently came under new ownership and i believe they also have new tables. Talk about great food and drink specials.
* **Munchies: Snoopy's/Char-Grill/Mecca/Cook Out/Most Bars** Bars close at 2 am. at 2:01, everyone goes to Snoopy's and Char-Grill. It's just the greasiest, trashiest, most delicious drunk food you'll be able to get your hands on. Mecca closes when it runs out of food or the cooks feel like cleaning up, but it's worth it to get there early. Great diner food. Most places on this list will serve food (especially the pubs) and most of the food is great.

And thank you to those of you who weren't dickish before! 

**EDIT. Here's the story** Sorry, a lot was going on last night guys!
So essentially I got a tip that some kids in oakwood were seen riding around on my bike on Saturday afternoon ... then Monday night I found my bike on Craigslist, because apparently... criminals are fucking stupid. Set up a meeting with the guy, which was the easiest part of all, and then it went to hell.. the cops had urgent calls and I was alone outside of this guys apartment with him walking to and from the door and me in my car half a block down for over an hour. It was warm, my windows were down, and his wife was eaves dropping on us for 45 minutes! (OFC I didn't know it was his wife. It was a lady who was parked near us for a long while, then parked in front of their home for another fifteen minutes, then finally went in.) Eventually, the police had me meet them at a church close by, describe my bike in great detail, hand them pictures, and off they went back to his home and told me to wait for their call. After 20 minutes or so, the police had me come back to the man's house and walk to his front door to take my bike from him, which is when an officer said ""Whatever. I'm giving your bike back to it's rightful owner now, buddy."" and ""You described it perfectly! Right to the T!"" I felt victorious then sat there for another 30 minutes on the bumper of my station wagon with my bike in my car staring at the guy who was trying it resale it.

Apparently, this guy pays another kid $800 a week just to *CLEAN* bikes for him. So what do we really think he's doing? The guy was charged with a misdemeanor and gave the police the location he purchases his bikes from, so the police are investigating the whole situation. 

I apologized for taking up so much of their time, and the officers were like, ""No. We love when people get their shit back. I'd be pissed if someone stole my bike off of my porch too!""

",adamtrimmer5,45,11,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/urrn4/ok_so_i_am_going_to_start_posting_a_thread/,"**EDIT**: [THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE SO FAR](http://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/us13k/whats_going_on_this_weekend_dont_have_anything_to/)



There are so many people that are simply looking for stuff to do or just people to hang out with every weekend, that I feel this is necessary. 

Here is how it will work. Post something you are doing or something your looking to do in the comments. Other redditors will see that and comment ""I am in"",or ""I may want to do that too"" or whatever, just comment so we can figure out if anyone else wants to come. If it is something that other people want to do I will help coordinating a meeting time and place, and put everyone in the OP under the edits.  I will post them in as best order as I can so that things that are happening on Friday come up on top.

 An example I will give is that I saw a couple separate redditors are going to the railhawks game on Saturday(i think that's the day) So i would make an edit post on the thread similar to this:

**Carolina Railhawks Game Saturday 8:15** *drinking optional* (I 
Redditors going (2)&lt;-- number will increase as people comment)
Meet up at the snack bar at 8:00 &lt;-- I will need OP's idea for a spot for to meetup. The person who suggests the event or what ever will give a brief description that I will put right here. 

**The first Rule of this thread will be: do not post stuff you are doing unless you want to invite people to it**. So if your going to a house party but you don't know if you can invite people to it, or you don't want any redditors to come and meet you don't post. No one cares what your doing this weekend, this is more for meeting up, and meeting new people. 

**The second rule is: don't be shy**. Your event doesn't have to be the coolest thing ever. If you want to sit at home and play video games put it up, there is sure to be another person that is exactly what they want to do and wouldn't mind doing it with another person. 

Lets give it a try, there are some many redditors just looking to hang out. Lets all make some new friends!!

what do you guys think?

**edit** this will not be used to promote your shitty band, or used to get people to come out so you can make money off them. I will delete that shit. If you have a band that is playing say sincerely what it is and times and be prepared to have a meetup time and place with people BEFORE the show.

What I had in mind was a session going over safety and handling and then a trip to one of the local ranges.  I am a certified Range Safety Officer.  I would see us going to one of the two local PUBLIC ranges, either PDHSC or eagle one.  I can provide the equipment, but ammo and range fees would need to be covered by those attending.  
    
I would like to keep this both safe and productive so would like to limit the group size to no more than 2 per person instructing, I do have a few friends that could help as well and my wife could assist as she is a shooter and sometimes women shooters can help women better.

If interested respond here or PM me.

EDIT:
prerequisites: if you just want to shoot a .22 rifle, I can teach you and your parent, must be over 10 for the youth(and parent must accompany).  If you want to shoot handguns, must be over 21.
Any range we go to will require a safety test before shooting, the instruction part should make you able to pass that but we will go over it.  Other than that, clothes(most ranges are cold in winter due to heavy ventilation), no pregnant weapon(lead dust is bad), no food at/on the range. be ready to practice, and have money for lane fees(around 15 dollars an hour, 1 dollar per target I think, and 15-20 for box of ammo or more depending on what you want to shoot(.22 is cheap will start there, other calibers are more expensive), shoes close toed shoes, hot brass is hot.

Alright the date has been moved to Sunday night, everything in Pullen park was booked ""months"" in advance and the next best time is Sunday 6/24 from 7pm-9pm. I scouted it out today and here are some pictures of the location http://imgur.com/a/7LHGR#0

I have chosen Pullen park because it is the least headache for me and I hope that everyone can make peace with the decision. I understand that some of you guys don't like the idea of a potluck, and if so, you are welcomed to bring food for yourself, after-all it isn't about the food it's about the people.

Everyone who can make it, **please leave a comment below for a headcount** and indicate what you can bring to the potluck (especially if you are a vegetarian). *If you can't bring anything, then that is completely a-ok, but you better bring yourself!*

I will buy some patties and an array of hot dogs and buns from BJs. (Unless someone knows where I can get the goodstuff). If you are a grilling expert (or have a grill you can bring) then please indicate so in the comment or PM me, because I have no experience with grilling. 

If anyone can come about 20 minutes earlier and help me set everything up then please PM me. I'm hoping to setup some activities e.g.: sack race.

Oh and **NO ALCOHOL** in the park, but everyone is free to figure out a bar to go to afterwards, I simply don't have the time nor the resources to figure everything out. We have 3 days people let's make this happen.

Over the weekend I was over at Justin's (Millbrook and Falls) having a shwarma when I noticed a pizza joint that I had never seen before.  It's called Cristos Ny Style Pizza and it is right beside Tijauna Flats.  I finished my shwarma and still had enough room for a slice so I popped into Cristos to give it a try.  It was awesome.  Best NY style I've had in the Triangle.  Their sauce and crust is so damn yummy.

  When it comes to NY style, I've always been a fan of Franks, IP3's, and Randys but my all time favorite in the area is Salvatores which doesn't really count because apparently you can only get his pizza at Shakori Hills Grassroots Festival which I frequent twice a year.  But now I'm thinking that Cristos might actually be better than Salvatores.  I don't know.  I'd have to try them side by side.  Cristos is definitely the closest thing to Salvatore's in the area.

As for tacos...I was on my way to Popeye's Chicken and if you are a fan of Popeye's then you know that the only one is in east Raleigh on New Bern Ave.  On the way there I noticed a place called The Taco Market directly across the street so I popped in there to get a torta.  I'm a huge fan of tortas.  I pull in the drivethru, order a chicken torta, pull forward, pay, and then wait a good 7-10 minutes.  I immediately thought that this is a good sign because I don't want no stinkin' premade, microwaved torta.  So, she comes back to the window and hands me my torta, asks me if I want any homemade hot sauce and I say yes.  As she is gathering the sauce, this delicious smell of the torta fills my car and when she returns I tell her that I can tell by the smell that this is going to be a good torta.  She laughs and I drive off.  The smell becomes so strong that I can't take it anymore so I open that puppy up at the next stop light and gobble half of it down.  It was awesome and all over my shirt.

I arrived to the house and immediately began dissecting it's contents.  Tortas are rarely ever constructed the same way but this one is how I want all future tortas.  Seasoned chicken, lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, onions, refried beans, guacamole, AND two slices of bacon between the most delicious crispy and fluffy homemade torta bread.  Why did they include bacon on a chicken torta?  Because bacon.

With that being said, I went back a few days later to try their tacos and they were just ok.  I prefer Chubby's.  However, the Taco Market does have a decent toppings bar inside so you can add all kinds of shit to your taco from pico, radishes, jalapenos, sauteed onions, hot sauce etc.  The tacos were ok but the torta was phenomenal.

The current owners are taking her to an animal shelter soon unless I can find someone to take her.

Please let me know if you or anyone you know would be interested in taking Cappuccino.

She is a 7 year-old, pure Persian cat and was born in Dubai. She is a loving cat and would follow me and sleep next to me wherever I sat or laid down. She's playful and has a powerful jump.

EDIT:
The current owner just emailed me, saying she feels horrible about giving her away and that she made the decision under a lot of stress. She promised to devote more time to Cappuccino and try again.

Edit:  thank you everyone for your suggestions. Hopefully I make it through the trip heart attack free. 

UPDATE:  Thanks again for all the suggestions.  Stopped at Parker's in Wilson on the drive out to OBX.  One of the highlights of the trip.  Fantastic.

I was at a conference conference, and was unfortunately unable get away to make it to Cooper's while they were open.  I ate at the Pit, which was good, but no where nearly as good + cool as Parker's.  

Non BBQ: I tried Sitti, because I read lots of recommendations for it, and it did not disappoint.  Great place, delicious food.  The conference made us eat at the Big Easy one night, and that place is a disgrace.  The worst thing is that we had people there from other countries, and New Orleans has one of this country's most interesting and delicious cuisines,  but that food was an embarrassment.

So the penalties for breaking my lease are quite stiff. I have two options: pay ~4 months rent, or find someone else to rent it. 

The only reason I'm even bothering posting this here: I'm willing to bribe anyone that's looking for an apartment in Raleigh. I pay $715 a month here for rent+water, and another $45-$55 for power from Progress, but if you are willing to take over the lease I'll gladly pay for at least one full month's rent and bills; I was thinking of offering perhaps ~$900 once everything was settled.

I feel that an open air market/farmer's market would be a great addition to the warehouse district and Raleigh in general. Building one could be affordable, especially if it's built as part of another project. A simple metal roof (or a stylish one if enough support) and basic water and electric services and the vendors can bring the rest.  

Would you support such a project? Would you support an independent project that achieve a similar result? I feel that it would bring positive growth to the area and can be done cheaper than any other option. 

I don't like the current Farmer's Market location. It's in the middle of nowhere and as it is it doesn't get the traffic as it could in a better location. I live only a mile away and it's still inconvenient as I have to cut through the NCSU campus to reach it or take a longer route.

Yesterday my bike was stolen and this is my most prized possession. This was my fathers bike and was ridden around the world for more than half a million miles since the 70's.

We live right next to a sprinkler room that has been leaking for a long time. The walls between us and that room has a ton of mold which is seeping into our apartment. We took pictures of all the mold and had the place inspected. The moisture level is high and there is mold in every single room.

The management won't pay for our motel bills. They also refuse to put us in their vacant apartment right above us without charging us for the third bedroom (ours is a two bedroom two bathroom apartment). Apparently, they aren't responsible for putting a roof over our head. And unfortunately, we had no idea that renter's insurance would cover that type of expense, or so we've been told by the mold inspectors.

I can't get a hold of my attorney as of right now, so my wife and I are just waiting in the leasing office until they come up with some options for us. I've been doing some research, and I don't see anything specific about ordinances or laws pertaining to the amount of mold in a NC apartment.

Here's some pictures of the mold if anyone is curious (http://imgur.com/a/O37kq), but disregard the last picture of the upper part of a lawn mower engine. We emailed them about the mold last month, but they haven't done anything about it until today.

***UPDATE***

I've been able to convince them to reimburse us for staying at a motel until they get the mold issue resolved by a professional crew. I'm going to hold off on the legal stuff for the time being since they seem to be actively attempting to fix the leak and moisture problem. They did notice that I was calling around for legal information while I was waiting in their office, so maybe that shook them up a bit.",,False,,t5_2r0z3,1373327171.0,,,True,t3_1hvddr,http://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/1hvddr/legal_issues_regarding_mold_in_our_apartment/,

The final straw for me was without any notice that my bundle promo is up (They are required to give you notice...I got nothing in the mail, no phone calls, no emails) they charge me $159 for a month's worth of service. When I call to question it, they tell me ""Sorry...here's a $20 credit...will that help?"" *Yes, of course $20 will fix the fact that you fucked up.....surrrreeee* 

I called 5 days ago to cancel my cable services..no date or time was given to me about when someone was coming to disconnect us. I get a call today that they are coming tomorrow...during my work day. An issue I could have resolved if they DID THEIR JOB! So we're okay without television...anything we watch can be streamed online anyway.

We hope you like popcorn, nachos, hot dogs and... the tears of marketers big and small.
 
“180°"" is a new event series here at RTP HQ that celebrates the collaboration between the Triangle's universities, companies and communities. For our July 23 event, ""Film in NC,” we hope you will join us from 6:00-8:00, at RTP’s headquarters (12 Davis Drive, Durham, NC). Our doors open at 5:00 so you can stop in right after work to grab a snack; and a reception will follow after the event.

In May, we challenged all of the marketers in the Triangle to come up with the best, most creative 2-3 minute video shorts to advertise our region. Now, they will be judged by an elite panel of film industry experts. (Okay, we made the ruthless part up, but it sounds entertaining.)

Emcee Will Hardison returns to host RTP 180°: Film in NC, and we hope you'll join us.

No suits, no ties, and definitely no hats, unless they're red fedoras. This is the future of RTP. And it's a loud one.

Judges/Panelists:

Addie Miller, Movie Star - This ""The Walking Dead"" and ""Secret Life of Bees"" star is a candid young lady, and one of our favorite people. We are honored to have her as a guest on our panel!


Aaron Syratt, NC Film Commissioner - The film industry in North Carolina is booming, and represents a substantial amount of growth in our state.

Lani Simeona, Full Frame Film Festival - Communications Director @ Durham's Full Frame Festival.

We are working on confirming additional judges and will publish updates as they become available.


Additional Details:

The 180° series is meant to be fun and light-hearted -- a showcase for all the awesome of the Triangle. Our last event garnered some press attention and general appreciation; we hope you'll join us for the next iteration.

The hashtag for the event is #RTP180.

And after the event, videos of speakers will be uploaded to our YouTube channel over at www.youtube.com/user/TheRTPNC.

If you win, you can get a bunch of free entree cards for even MORE burritos.  Or nachos, whatever. I'm not here to judge. 

Source: I work at this Qdoba. :)

EDIT: The name of the game is speed. Who is the fastest burrito eater of the group. If there's enough people separate brackets will be made and the fastest of those will have a second burrito to contest with. As of right now, winner gets 30 free Entree cards and runner ups in that top few get 1 free entree card.

Note: Be sure to stop by and fill out a form to join the contest. Name, e-mail and phone number I think is all you need. You don't even need to fill out the phone number part, but it's nice. We send out texts/e-mails telling about special offers (buy one get one free, $1 tacos, etc). Our store is particularly slow, so you'll probably get them quite frequently from our store.

He was in a coma, with a broken neck, brain trauma, 3 broken ribs and other issues.  He has no insurance and the doctors are not sure if he will ever walk or have normal brain function again.

He came out of his coma yesterday and was taken off of the respirator. He hasn't spoken yet but he did open his eyes.

Tonight all of the drivers are donating their tips to [Justin](http://www.wral.com/news/local/video/8643019/#/vid8643019).  

If you are in the Raleigh, NC area and can come out and help support him, that would be great.  

If you would like to donate some money to help out in other ways contact Raleigh Rickshaw Company, via the email address or phone number on the [website](http://raleighrickshaw.com) or its [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/raleigh.rickshaw).

[Here is the Facebook event page](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=177371608939613).

**update 1**
We are in the process of setting up a non-profit with a bank account and paypal.  Hopefully we will have all of the paperwork done and ready middle of next week.  If you would like to donate by check and can mail it to:

&gt; Friends Of Justin Walker

&gt; c/o Duncan Moon

&gt; 910 Spring Gate Ct.

&gt; Apex, NC 27502

Last night we had 8 drivers out and we took in nearly $1000 in donations to Justin.   Thanks to everyone who contributed.

Also [The Borough](http://www.theboroughraleigh.com/) and [The Hibernian](http://www.hibernianpub.com/) on Glenwood are going to put out donation jars for Justin.  There will probably be some more donation spots later.

If you are out downtown and you would like to donate to Justin, just stop one of the Raleigh Rickshaw drivers and tell them that you would like to donate. We will be happy to add your donation to the fund.

**Justin's health update** He is out of his coma but heavily sedated, he is speaking a little, but mostly confused gibberish.  He is restrained so that he does not injure his neck but he doesn't understand why.  It looks like he has some motor function in his legs, but it is still to early to tell if or how he will be affected long term.

What was supposed to be a devil heart with wings and a tilted halo ended up being something that closely resembled the Batman symbol. Thankfully, it was on my lower back, but still a source of embarrassment when the topic of tattoos came up in conversation. 

In 2007, on a trip back up to NY to visit family, I had my father's dates and initials added to the Batman. I've known the artist since Junior High and he was a good artist, so I trusted him. WRONG! He did not put the ink in deep enough, and it looked like he got the date of my dad's death wrong (12/25/96 instead of 12/24/96).

Fast forward to about a week ago. I am talking to a woman at work about the tattoo shop her husband works at. She gives me the number to the shop and we set something up. This man turned shit into gold. After seeing a bunch of his artwork I just trusted him to do whatever he felt would look good.

So yesterday afternoon, I went up to Foxy Tattoos off of Capital Blvd in Raleigh. Three hours later, I walked out a happy puppy!

Give them a call, and make sure you ask for Paul!

Moving to Raleigh in a few weeks (I'm sure some of you have already had PMs from me regarding other issues, thanks to those of you that have assisted!) and was wondering what the best cable/internet options are?

I currently have U-Verse internet only, 3mbps, and it works just fine.  I stream, download, surf, and XBOX LIVE just fine (it is just me).  However I will be having a roommate who also has an XBOX and who also will stream, surf, and download just as much as me.  He wants to actually have cable (for ESPN), and I am not really that averse to splitting it with him.  Just wondering what natives would suggest for us!

Thanks so much!!

EDIT:

Thank you to all those who have responded.  It seems the general consensus is AT&amp;T U-Verse if available, otherwise DirectTV for television and TWC for internet.  I'll discuss it with the roommate and see what we decide on.

Would love some insight for my particular situation.",ThisIsWhatICameFor,16,8,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/zgt8i/considering_relocating_to_raleigh_but_am/,"My wife and I have lived in the Pacific Northwest since we were teenagers. We are now in our early 30s with 3 children. We have very little family and only a few close friends here, otherwise there is nothing keeping us here. She is a stay-at-home mother and I work from home. We tried the Bay Area a couple times, but it's just too much traffic and noise for us to be comfortable, and we couldn't raise children there. We tried Seattle, but the weather just isn't for us.

**What we're tired of:**

* Going to the same few places to eat, the same stores and mall to browse in, the same scenery — trees and lakes (yes, pine trees are beautiful, but I've been looking at them for 20 years now!), the same few parks. We're tired of not having variety.

* There's nothing to do here but camping and shopping, and that's not our thing. The lake is a decent place during the hottest summer months, but that's it. The *coast* here is a joke with cold dark water that is only enjoyable on during the two hottest months of the year.

* California transplants have driven home prices and rent prices to an absurd level. You pay a lot for a house in a subdivision of .2 acre lots and no yards. We're over it.

* It's expensive to fly in and out of our airport and we absolutely LOVE to travel. If we want to take the family to Disenyland, it's $2,000 in plane tickets or a 12 hour drive. If we wanted to go to DC, Maine, Florida, etc., it would cost several thousand if we planned ahead. It simply costs too much to experience the country, and the world, from this part of the US.

* The weather is relatively extreme with summers seeing mostly 90+ (up to 110) and winters that are long and wet. 



**What we think we are looking for:**

* We are good people, but we are not religious at all. We have religious friends, but we don't have atheist vs theist discussions with them out of respect for one-another. We don't want to be treated poorly for being atheists though, and we have heard that this can be the case in that region of the country.

* We want to be able to meet people easily. I love to do everything from working on my classic cars to weekend adventure guy trips to gaming to golf and a lot of stuff in-between. My wife loves to socialize. My children like golf and Lego and gaming. We want an easy way to meet people like s, or at least people that we would get along with. We don't have to be like you to like you :)

* We like to eat out, so good restaurants (not national chains) is important.

* As a user interface designer and software developer, I would love a community of like-minded folks to share ideas with, possibly create joint ventures. Where I am now, I am a big fish in a small pond and it's difficult to progress professionally.

* A place where we can get a lot of house for our money (anything under $3k a month for a rental is fine) renting without having to settle for .25 acre cookie cutter lots in poorly planned subdivisions. We don't care if the houses are the same, but we would like some trees and grass and space between us and the neighbor. Anything around an acre or more would be great. A pool, or access to a community pool (not a public pool) would be fantastic.

* More *stuff* to do. We would like to be close (within a couple hours travel time by car) to resorts, water parks, amusement parks, museums, plays, couples retreats, horseback riding, boating, summer camps for the kids, cultural and historical districts, and anything else that will enrich our lives, the lives of our children, and/or put a smile on our faces. I don't know if there's anywhere in the country you can get all these things, but any combination of half would be great!

* My wife loves the snow, and I love the beach and tropical weather. If she had her way, we would end up in Maine; If I had mine, we would end up in Florida. We're looking for something inbetween, but close enough to both that a half-day drive or an hour-or-two flight can get us to either depending on the season.

* Our oldest will be going to college in the next couple years and we would like to have a good local college so she doesn't have to move too far from home.



It has really started to hit home that we are wasting our lives living so far removed from what metro areas have to offer. They are so, so, so very short and we aren't living them to their fullest. Every moment we waste not experiencing something new or better than we already have, I get this anxious sinking feeling that these are moments I wouldn't be wasting if we were somewhere with more to offer. We are interested in Raleigh because it is somewhat centrally located to the placed we want to visit (Maine, DC, Boston, Florida, everything in-between, international flights) and the airport is large enough that flights are relatively inexpensive. The housing prices are low for what you can get, and there seems to be a lot to do.

We'll probably be there in the middle of the week, but we're not too into nightlife anyway. We like hiking, parks, biking, markets, neat down-towny areas, brewpubs, that kind of thing. We'll probably concentrate on the west side of the city, around the area surrounding RTP and maybe visit Chapel Hill as well.

Thanks!

I've done quite a bit of research about Raleigh and Cary so my questions aren't just about where to live. I can answer those questions myself. I'm more curious if the picture I've put together in my head of Raleigh is accurate or if I'm fooling myself.

My boyfriend and I have lived in Oakland, CA for about 6 years. He's originally from NJ and I from Ohio. While we both have done well for ourselves out here in Cali and have successful careers, we are getting very worn down by the lifestyle. I find myself constantly frustrated and angry with people here, their self entitled ""F-you"" attitude, the crime, the crowds and the noise among other things. I hate that when I hear a sound outside my window I have to pause and think - was that a firecracker or should I be reporting gunshots? Our car has ended up with bullet holes before. I hate this city. I hate this state. I yearn for the small town quiet like feel that I grew up with in Ohio. (Why don't we move to Ohio or NJ? We dislike snow!)

What I do like about it is the opportunities I've had to meet different people and learn so many new cultures. I like that the people I work with are educated and interesting. I like that people are accepting of other lifestyles. I have gay friends, I am pro life and child free. I worry that leaving this area for a southern state might come as a cultural shock for me in that regard. 

I know that Raleigh and the surrounding area has a pretty OK job market for my field (I'm a project manager for web/app/digital design) and I am not too concerned with finding work. I also know that we'll be able to comfortably live on a salary typical for my work.

1.Alamogordo, New Mexico to see the white sands national monument. This is a spectacular gypsum sands desert.Cool to touch and one of the must see places.

2.Socorro, New Mexico - The home of VAL - Very large array telescope. I have visited the deepest place in death valley,CA but was swarmed by clouds. This is my chance to look at the stars one more time.

Route: Atlanta,GA - Tosacaloosa,AL - Jackson,MS - shreveport LA - Dallas,TX - Alamogordo, New Mexico

Google maps says it takes exactly 30 hours and 1800 miles to drive there.We will be sharing the driving task. I have a nice 2011 honda civic with great gas mileage. The cost of the gas is on me. Based on the extent we are exhausted, we may have to invest into a motel. we will be mostly camping. A Team of 3 people will get us faster there.

We will plan to see the sunrise at the white sands, and then post sunset - stars at VLA. Also, I will plan a few pitstops.

Please PM me - ASAP. We will meet ahead of time.

I've been living at URaleigh (the new UVillage) for the past year, and things have been decent. Few roaches, not too loud, good environment. Everything was fine, but I planned to move out at the end of July as I had other living plans, and I didn't have any lease planned anymore at UVillage/URaleigh (I also checked 4 times over the course of 4 months, each time they said I was lease-free).

URaleigh had other plans. Apparently the lease I have continues on for this next coming year, (some issue with the company transition from Uvillage to Uraleigh) and I now have the lease at Uraleigh and the one at my future place of living right up the road.

So I ask you,

Has anyone else had a problem like this? If so, what did you do? And, (just maybe) is anyone looking for a place to live?

The dog's name is Daisy- she's a boxer mix whose adoption fee is 95 dollars, but I'd be willing to split it with you if you're willing to give her a sweet picket fence type home. I love these guys, but I don't have the time or the money to feed them all. If you're interested, pm me for pictures, info, etc.

So,  what's the best tattoo shop in Raleigh? I found Phoenix, on Hillsborough, but want to check first if anyone has better suggestions.

**Update:** So,  I appreciate all the suggestions from everyone. First off, this was for my mom who was visiting me this week. She wanted to get a foot tattoo, hence the post. We originally tried Blue Flame, however, they didn't have an opening until today so we couldn't do that. The only day that we could go was Monday, and Phoenix was closed. We decided to go to Le Femme Fatale on Avent Ferry. It turned out to be awesome. She was really great about everything and the tattoo turned out great. I think my mom might even get another when she comes back down this winter. Thanks again for all the help.

(Not an Apartment Complex)",Unlogicalme,7,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/w0kob/needing_a_place_to_rent_small_houseapartment_not/,"Stuff with the Room mate I have went south, apparently I have to tell her whenever and who I have over, even though they sit in my room with me the entire time.  So being as I don't want to live with someone that tries to be a parent to me, I am looking for a small house/apartment (even if it's a Basement apartment) that someone is renting out. I am looking to spend under $550, but can go higher if need be. 

Lets see, some things about me: 

-I am a 27 year old male, I work full time for the great company of Time Warner Cable (have been with them for the past 2 1/2 years, but was with them for 1 year back in 2005) I left Time Warner to take a contracting job over seas in Iraq for the US Government. I am a Service tech with the company, I'm the awesome guy that comes out and fixes your stuff whenever it breaks.

- I don't party at my house, the biggest types of parties I have are when I play my PS3 online. Even then, it's just me in my place playing with people from around the country online. 

- I am Ex Military (army) and an Iraq War veteran. I got out in 2006 after a 4 year term. I joined as I was in High school, and was deployed in 2005 as soon as I got to Fort Bragg after Airborne school. I miss the military every day, but I love where I am in life right now.

- I am an EXTREME neat freak. I think I might have a slight case of ADD when it comes to my cleanliness, but if you think about it it's not a bad thing.

- I have no animals

- I do not smoke, and if anyone is ever at my place, I ALWAYS make them go outside and smoke. Can't stand the smell of it

- Rent will be on time every month. I have no other bills other than rent and a small credit card ($250 limit just for emergencies) My Truck is paid off and I drive my Time Warner van 5 days a week.

I'm sure there is so much more, but feel free to ask away. I am looking at moving Next weekend, so around the 14th of July? If anyone is renting out a small home/apartment home, please let me know.

I feel horrible for doing this, like I'm exploiting for attention, but my babies have to be given away soon. I've spent all of today sending emails and calling non-kill shelters waiting for responses. I thought maybe someone in my area would like a cat or cats in their home. Their names are Angel (7), Faith (2), and Wingnut (4). Here is a picture of each in that order http://imgur.com/a/pObz5#0

Angel is mostly white with a black spot on her back that looks like a flying angel. She is over weight, but a big built cat. She licks everything in sight and she loves to watch Animal Planet and she'll snuggle right next to you when you want to sleep. If you are upset, she'll be right at your side. She will cry at the door to go outside, but she is an indoor kitty.

Faith is the youngest and boy does she have an attitude. She also responds to every other name then her own. She will snuggle and play around, but don't touch her belly or pick her up. You can hide behind a wall and pop out and she will meow and slowly hunt you down until she finds you. She is good with strangers, and good with other cats, but she does like to start trouble. She also can't have any doors closed on her, unless they've always been closed for boundaries, or she'll scratch the rug until you let her in. She can be a little trouble, but boy is she sweet. She also jumps up on light switches until they are in the ""off"" position.

Wingnut is shy and fluffy. She will sit in the hallway like a Buddha statue and just purr. She sleeps with her paws in the air and be the laziest thing in the world, but swing a string around her and it's a different cat! Her hair can get really clumpy if no one has combed her, but I try to comb her once a day if she lets me. She likes to be carried and she is TERRIFIED of the outdoors. But she is such a sweetheart and the lappiest lap cat you could ever find.

All three of them enjoy an open window and a place to lay by that open window. They don't dig-up furniture, except for Faith, and laser lights are their best friends. Faith and Angel do better together than Faith and Wingnut, but they all do about the same together or alone. I love them so much and I just want them to find a good home or homes.

Bought a used car (2000 Toyota Corolla). This is my first vehicle. It needs tires. Any recommendations on where to go? I spend most of my time in the Rex Hospital/NCSU area. Basically looking for a place that has good, quick service and reasonable prices.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

Edit: so far, the best place I've been able to come up with is Discount Tires. They sell some no-name brand that gets 40,000 miles for $60. They sell Pirelli tires which get 85,000 miles for $75 each. They also sell some michelin, kuhmo, and a few other brands which get the higher mileage for similar prices.

Double the miles for 25% more money per tire seems like it's a no-brainer. Is that about right?

This might be for you! As a recent college grad, I miss having the opportunity to perform with fellow musicians. I am hoping maybe some talented people could get together and start something! Ideally, I would be aiming for ""young professional aged people,"" but if you're interested and you don't fit in that category, do not dismay (basically I don't want to open this up to fourth graders, but I'm fine with older, experienced people)! Just let me know you would like to participate! As far as music type... I love Eric Whitacre and other classical music. However, I'm open to other music (broadway, pop, Buble... etc!). I don't plan on doing this on an audition basis (certainly not a super formal audition!), more just a fun thing for anyone who would like to join.



If you are interested, PM me or reply here with the following:

* Name
* vocal part and/or instrument
* What are your strengths? How could you contribute to our group?
* prior experience
* What kind of music would you like to see the group perform?


For example, I would PM myself the following:

* Jewels
* soprano, tuba, piano, clarinet
* I am an excellent organizer/planner. I enjoy getting people together and planning events.
* musical lessons since childhood, high school and college wind ensemble and choir, music minor in college
* Eric Whitacre!!!!!! and broadway... and classical...

Senator,

As one of your constituents I am writing you this in regards to the upcoming vote on CISPA. I was sorely disappointed to see that Rep. McIntyre voted yes for this bill. I believe this bill is just as bad as SOPA if not worse. I understand in this day and age our government has to protect its citizens however I strongly feel though that giving up our privacy and liberties to combat this is just wrong and in fact it is giving into the terrorists. What better way could they win? They are defeating our liberties and freedom by scaring our representatives to support bills like this. I voted for you last election but if you support this bill I can assure you that you will not have my vote nor that of many of my friends at my university. Your younger generation does not agree with these draconian laws and as they know CISPA to be. Again, I plead to you to vote no on this bill. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Please help!,iamtonedef,7,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/raleigh/comments/zu5f6/need_advice_on_legal_obligations_of_taking_in_a/,"Ok, quick backstory. A couple of months ago on July 11th,  an adorable little stray cat showed up on our doorstep. We looked around an asked some neighbors, but nobody recognized her. We just couldn't bare to leave her out by herself. She was rather thin, very friendly and wasn't wearing a collar to identify her. We took her in for the night, got her some food and a cheap litter tray. She devoured the food we gave her and quite happily jumped up in our laps and fell asleep. The next day, we began calling the SPCA and other local shelters in an effort to find the owner.  I even posted to reddit about it. We also looked around for any lost cat flyers, with no sucess. About a week later, we took her to the vet to have her scanned for a chip. Turns out she had a chip, but it wasn't registered with any owner information. All the chip company could give us was the name of the adoption agency that installed it. I called them the next day and asked if the cat had been reported missing, to which they said no. Over the next two weeks, the adoption center made multiple attempts to contact the owners via phone, e-mail and regular mail, again with no sucess. At this point we've had the cat for three weeks. We then recieved a phonecall from the adoption center asking if we would like to have the chip updated with our information. My room-mate and I agreed that we'd put in more effort than most people would have to help find the owner, so we agreed. After that, we take her to the vet and have her checked out and signed up on a wellness plan. Our new kitty has been awesome. She's healthy, friendly, litter box trained, doesn't wreck the furniture, and most importantly has put on weight.   Fast forward to yesterday(09-12-12). I leave the house in the afternoon to find a stray dog on our porch. I walk up our street to find a possible owner, just as a lady walks out with a similar dog. Turns out, the stray dog was hers.  We laughed about it as I mentioned this was the second lost animal to turn up on our doorstep as we recently took in a stray cat. A few hours later, this lady shows up on our door step to inform us that she knows who our cat belongs to. Turns out it belongs to her ex room-mate. The lady immediately calls the room mate before we could get a word out. Turns out our neighbor kicked her out a while back for not making her rent payments and ""other things"".  Here is what we know about the owner. 

- Didn't take care of the cat very well.
- Couldn't make rent or car payments. 
- Had an arrest record for charges including writing worthless checks. 
- Had a reputation with nearby neighbors as being crazy and having a drinking problem. 

Here are my questions. What legal obligations do I have to give the cat back?  Shelters will only hold a lost animal for 3-5 days before they give it up for adoption. Does this apply to us? We have documented files showing we made an effort. 

If she insists on wanting the cat, is it unreasonable for me to be reimbursed for the hundreds of dollars already spent? Not to mention the vet bills we'll need to pay off for canceling her plan. 

Any advice on how to handle this lady when she finds out she'll need to pay at minimum $400?  The total will likely be much higher after we tally up all the food, litter, etc. 

Should be noted that this lady also lives very close to us and thanks to the neighbor, probably knows our exact address. 

Any advice would be appreciated!t

My plane tickets &amp; hotel are already paid, but I have some questions about other economy stuff and etc:

* how much is regularly spent by day/week in food and just ""living""? That means, how much money should I plan spending by day/week just to ""be"" there?
* is it easy (and not too expensive!) to rent a car and visit the mountains or the beaches? Or just move around town?
* How is the weather in October? Is already ""heavy winter""? or still leaving summer?

I represent a Raleigh, NC-based clan, Awesome Cougars (you can’t un-see it, be careful) who’s interested in taking things to the next level for in-house events and local tournaments. There’s no hiding the fact that the entire Triangle area in North Carolina is pretty quiet when it comes to StarCraft II, even when major events like MLG come to town (always the most under-hyped IMO). We’re in the process of running some small in-house tournaments trying to nail down a system that we can use to provide larger LAN-based tournaments to the entire Triangle area. If all goes well, we’ll push this further to NC, but yeah, we’ll get to that later.

We’re going to be hosting the finals for our in-house tournament season next weekend, and the single biggest thing we’re missing for a halfway-crappy production is a dedicated caster. I intend to make some follow-up posts in about a month looking for 16 or so additional players to come hang out at my apartment and run our own Homestory Cup-like event until we can find a space to grow it. However, we need to nail down some holes in the entire production process, and the last major one is casting. We have our own players swapping out for casting during the games, and to be honest, we’re Bronze through Diamond, so it’s a little hit and miss...SOOOOO!!!!!

Are you old enough to drive? Old enough to party (oh baby)? Love StarCraft II to pieces, feel like Tastosis is copying everything from your mind and that you’re actually the 1337soss chosen one the community hasn’t found yet? Want to be fed copious amounts of soft drink and disgusting party foods (I make some mean jalapeno poppers) while screaming at how bad we are during games? Then boy I have a solution for you! PM me if you’re interested in getting involved some way, or even more if you’re interested in playing within the next month and a half when our local tournament in Raleigh, NC is supposed to kick off. We’d really like to find a caster we can work with and get used to the set up so that we can provide a great production, it’s always good to find a new friend local, this should be a great opportunity to be a front face for a hopefully great digital production!

In addition to the link to our tournament website in the title, here are some additional links to the type of setup we’re using (we’re running some nice PA equipment, player cameras, etc.), my apartment and some of the people involved. Right now there are 13 of us (give or take one depending on who’s playing on a given weekend). If you’re interested, I’d invite you out to my apartment this coming weekend for a cookout to maybe meet some of the guys and enjoy the good weather. Maybe we can add someone totally sweet to our rag-tag outfit of players.
