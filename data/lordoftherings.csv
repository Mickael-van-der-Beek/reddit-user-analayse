1363919655.0,754,self.lordoftherings,1aryha,Can someone please explain why technology in the universe of LOTR does not develop beyond the iron age?,Papatato,974,220,773,http://www.reddit.com/r/lordoftherings/comments/1aryha/can_someone_please_explain_why_technology_in_the/,"I just don't understand it.  It never bothered me until my recent watching of the fellowship where we find out that about 3000 years pass between the time Sauron was defeated and when the ring came to Frodo.  3000 years.  At the time of that battle, they had what was clearly advanced mastery of iron and steel, so they must have been at the level of technology similar to our late iron age which lasted about 300 years.  Then ten times longer than that passes and they are at the same level of technology!  Almost no innovation took place for 3000 years.  And it isn't because they had magic instead, because most peoples did not.  Only the five wizards and the elves had any mastery of magic and even that had not advanced.  And as intelligent as the dwarves are in the universe, they never invented the drill, which would have revolutionized their mining capabilities and advanced their culture by leaps and bounds.  So someone who is more versed in this universe, I beg of you to clarify why nothing in their world had changed in all that time.

He carries those things around with him the entire trilogy. When he is fighting the giant spider or climbing up mountains, he never ditches the pots. He keeps his backpack on and seems to keep all his supplies with him, but Peter Jackson keeps these pots hanging from his bag, in plain view whenever they show Sam. 

I assume it symbolizes hope. Sam loves food like most Hobbits and he fantasizes about roast chicken with Frodo. Hope was a major theme of the trilogy. 

But the thing that gets me, is when Sam throws them off. They are thrown [directly at the camera](http://i.imgur.com/VRwdWTX.jpg) shortly after Frodo complains that the ring is too much of a burden to carry because it's so heavy. 

Is that the point where they lose hope? Right before they reach the ultimate destination? I'm struggling with the meaning because when they are about to reach the pinnacle, I feel as if hope is greatest. But the pots are gone. 

I wonder if it symbolizes the point where they lose their boyish character, and the pots represented that purity. After that shot, Frodo's face look tattered as all hell. 

I'm struggling to put my finger on their meaning. Any other ideas? ",,False,self,t5_2rnel,False,,,True,t3_17om3f,http://www.reddit.com/r/lordoftherings/comments/17om3f/the_meaning_of_samwise_gamgees_pots/,

I read all the books growing up and loved the LOTR films and the new Hobbit film, but there is one thing that always gets me about these stories: the Eagles. This fantasy mechanic really doesn't make sense to me. These Eagles show up and literally save the day whenever Gandalf calls them. It always seemed a little far fetched and sort of a crutch. For instance, in LOTR, why wouldn't Gandalf just use the Eagles to fly the ring right into Mordor from the backside. They show up right at the end during the black gate battle, and just in time to rescue Sam and Frodo from scolding lava. Then in the Hobbit we see them rescue Thorin &amp; Co from death and drop them off a little ways away from the misty mountains. That's nice, but couldn't they have just flown them straight on to the lonely mountain?

I guess what I want to know is what are the rules with these Eagles? They can only help for a short time or something? They can't carry people long distances?

I just picked up my copy of the Hobbit ([the pocket sized leather one](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Hobbit-Deluxe-Pocket-Edition-J-R-R-Tolkien-Leather-Like-HARDCOVER-/110988608596?pt=US_Fiction_Books&amp;hash=item19d76fc454)) and am going to buy the LoTR series now.

My dilemma is which editions I want to buy.  

I'm thinking the ones in [this](http://www.target.com/p/the-return-of-the-king-the-lord-of-the-rings-part-three-by-j-r-r-tolkien-paperback/-/A-14238202#prodSlot=large_1_1&amp;term=lord of the rings) style.  However, I am tempted to spring for [this](http://images.betterworldbooks.com/061/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-9780618260584.jpg) one.

They changed a lot of the books to make the stories more interesting to McDonalds employees and bin-men. They also made it fucking cringeworthy and very homoerotic. Why have pretty children as hobbits when they clearly were not that way in the fucking books?!?!?!?!
