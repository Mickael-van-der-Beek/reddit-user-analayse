After reviewing the current trend of submitted posts to the sub, the following has been decided:


**The mods have decided NOT to enforce *required* technical discussion in this subreddit.**  If you want purely technical discussion, visit /r/Askscience, which has already adopted a scientific-only discussion decorum for all threads and responses. 


/r/AskEngineers is a subreddit dedicated to *general* engineering discussion. Anecdotal evidence, speculation, and non-expert responses are all part of a collaborative process which everyone can benefit from. Group discussion is, after all, an important part of the engineering process. 

We encourage everyone to refrain from posting without a fundamental knowledge of the subject matter in question. **As such, posts with 'incorrect' information will be removed, but only after 24 hours**, in hopes that someone with a better knowledge of the subject matter will correct the mistakes. The idea behind this is so anyone with the same 'incorrect' knowledge can have a chance to get involved in the discussion and educate themselves on the facts.


* Questions regarding career paths **will** be allowed in this subreddit as /r/Engineering and /r/EngineeringStudents are not as suitable for such content. This is not to be confused with questions regarding job seeking, which will not be allowed and will be removed. If you need advice or tips on finding a job, go see your school's career center. If you have a question regarding the type of career paths available to a certain engineering discipline, post away!

* Questions regarding degrees, colleges, GPA, etc, will **not** be allowed. Please direct these questions to /r/EngineeringStudents.

* Blatant trolling or disrespect will now be grounds for a permanent ban from the subreddit. Please keep the discussion as professional and respectful as possible. 

Thank you everyone who participated in the original discussion thread mentioned above. Feel free to post any further opinions or suggestions here.


Also, please upvote this post so it can stay on the front page for everyone to see. This is a self post, for which I will receive no Karma.

With that in mind I thought it might be amusing to swap war stories and maybe learn a bit from each other (As they say, anyone can learn from his own mistakes, the smart man learns from mistakes other people makes.).

I'll even go first.

I was working on a rush project and had to build some custom fixturing to accomplish a certain task.  I threw together the design and - being in such a hurry - didn't bother to spec welds.  I just took the drawings to the fab shop, grabbed the welder, and said to him, ""Weld the crap out of all these joints.""

What he apparently heard me say was, ""Give me crap welds on all these joints.""

The part was finished.  I even proof loaded it... But I've no idea how it survived the proof load because shortly after putting the unit into service a weld broke and we quite literally dropped a bomb (I work in the ordnance industry).  Upon inspection, there were some butt welds with virtually zero penetration and obviously zero surface prep.  Again, how it survived the proof load I'll never know.

But the whole mess landed in my lap after the investigation.  After all, I hadn't specified what sort of weld the guy was supposed to use.  Mind you, I informed him of the application and told him I needed good welds, but there was nothing on paper.....

Without any filter anywhere...?

A car has no problem driving in the rain because it draws in air from (usually) an intake beneath the bonnet (hood) where the rain doesn't fall. When you're flying in heavy rain, how do you keep the water out of the combustion chamber?

Summary:

1. Me: I griped in a post about the way Android will display a strong signal on some WiFi access points, but then when you attempt to connect, the signal display will change to become weak.
2. Response: ""Your phone has a better idea of the true signal once it tries to connect - it gets information about latency and dropped packets that won't be available otherwise. The actual hardware changes from monitor to active mode....""
3. Me: This issue doesn't seem to happen on Windows. [not in my original comment, but if they response I was replying to is correct, I wonder if it's merely a UI difference, and Windows simply doesn't display an updated signal strength of after it factors in latency and dropped packets]
4. Response: This is because laptops have more powerful WiFi adapters.
5. Me: That doesn't make sense, because if a more powerful WiFi adapter can reach further, you would expect that to simply increase the number of access points available, but access points at the edge of reception would still be marginal.
6. Response: It makes sense, because laptop WiFi is more powerful, and anyway, WiFi range is mostly a function of the router.
7. Me: Factually, more powerful cards and antennas do get you more access points, but besides, no matter the power, you would always expect that the access points on the edge of reception would be marginal.
8. Response: Link to Wikipedia on Inverse Square Law, with nothing else written.
9. Me, getting frustrated: I don't see how the Inverse Square Law means that when laptops connect to marginal access points they don't suddenly display a decrease in signal quality, nor do I see how it means a stronger card or antenna won't get greater range, and I've seen these phenomena before with my own eyes.
10. Physics.
11. I don't think the Inverse Square Law stands for these propositions at all, and a claim that power and antenna don't affect range not only contradicts the original assertion that this is because laptops have more powerful WiFi, but also the factual existence of setups that can receive WiFi over a mile away.

[This ""universal"" laptop brick](http://i.imgur.com/JBBvF.jpg) sort of demonstrates my point.

Growing up with lots of little toys that ran on DC, I've seen a gazillion different plugs come in a gazillion different sizes.  Many times, I've discovered certain sizes appear to be standardized on voltage, as two unrelated devices desiring the same voltage often use the same plug.  Laptops, however, seem to have no rhyme or reason to their plugs.  They appear to have the exact same range of gazillions of possible plugs.

On a desktop, I can grab just about any power supply and slot it in just about any machine (given a similar architecture/power requirement, since modern computers generally take additional power over older ones), and I can use whatever AC plug I find lying around.  Internally, all the components use the same DC plugs from the power supply.  Once in a blue moon, you might find a component that comes with an adapter, but that's generally to account for your power supply just not having enough of a standard plug (the most simple being fan adapters).

Now I realize that laptops are still highly proprietary and the internals are almost guaranteed to be plug-n-play incompatible, except for possible expansion cards, extra memory, and, on older laptops, wireless cards.  That said, why aren't the power bricks standardized?  Why does Lenovo (for example) have small plugs, large plugs, and now [a rectangular plug](http://i.imgur.com/X6lYQ.jpg)?  Couldn't the brick be standard and all the proprietary stuff be internal?

And how does a bra redistribute force to relieve back pain/damage? [possibly NSFW],boobforces,85,31,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/13jo7f/how_are_the_forces_exerted_on_the_human_back_by/,"Throwaway, as this is a somewhat embarrassing subject.

**Question:**

I know of women who can carry 15kg objects in their arms all day (taking frequent breaks) without experiencing back pain. However, if those same women do without a bra, leaving their 2.5kg breasts unsupported, they experience backaches in their lower and mid-spine within the hour. Why is this? Why do their backs not grow strong enough over time to support this weight? Also, how exactly does a bra redistribute force such that breasts no longer cause back pain?

Please don't brush this off as trolling; many people near and dear to me have suffered severe medical problems as a result of poorly-supported breasts, and so any answers which may help educate people on this topic are greatly appreciated. (Full disclosure: My aunt, whose breasts appear to be roughly 2.5kg, experienced early-onset osteoarthritis of the spine, possibly due to very unsupportive bras--the very weight of her own breasts may have induced severe trauma/injury to the cartilage between her vertebrae. I am also a female with 2.5kg breasts, and am concerned about developing this condition.)

**Suppositions/Possible Factors:**

* Range of motion experienced when carrying a heavy object is more limited (only standing, walking, squatting).
* Breaks are taken when carrying a heavy object to allow time to recover.
* When carrying a heavy object, muscles of the arm, back, and shoulders are involved. With breasts, only muscles of the back and shoulders are involved.

What kind of motors and actuators and things like that are we dealing with?

What about mechanical stuff? How long do they have to pump the water out before the corrosion gets really bad? Is the rail itself in jeopardy?

Is there a lot of damaged equipment that is irreplaceable, or is stuff being manufactured? Do we suppose they might choose to salvage equipment from one line in order to repair another of higher priority?

What about the structural integrity of the tunnels and tracks? Has the movement of water caused erosion problems that might have undermined the track?

I assume there's a lot involved in bringing power back up besides just waiting for the grid to come back. It's a separate DC system, right? Are there underground power substations just for the subway that could be flooded?

The president said secretary would send me the job offer, I said that be would great, and that all I had to do was sign it and start next week. The president proceeded to introduce me to everyone in the office and even tells the IT guy to make me an email account, double checking the spelling of my name.

When I get the written offer by email I crunch the numbers and realize the year end total is nearly $2000 less than what was discussed in the meeting. 

I sent a respectful email after talking to my adviser and career services restating my reasons as to why I deserve a higher hourly rate including higher cost of living in other state, the fact that they claimed my peers at higher rates are salaried (they mostly aren't) and what I was asking for was still low (40th percentile, roughly $5000 more, still extremely low for the area I'd be moving to).

I was sent a very curt email this morning saying that they had received my message and enclosed was the counter offer. The counter offer was merely a document stating that they withdrawing the offer of employment.

I seriously know I am an idiot, but is negotiating salary poor form for starting engineers?

I'm 23 and graduated with a BS in Materials Science and Engineering roughly 2 years ago.  Since then, I worked at a titanium mill, first as an Metallurgy intern (9 months) and then full-time as a Process Metallurgist (13 months).

As a Process Metallurgist, I helped develop the process routes for two new product lines and have them qualified by customers.  I also started and ran a couple projects that saved roughly $300k and will save another $400k over the next year.

About a week and a half ago, I was laid off.  I thought I'd be upset, but I just haven't been.  It's occurred to me that I didn't really like that job all that much, and that's why I haven't been too broken up about losing it.

While the work was cool and interesting at times, it seemed like there was a lot of resistance to anything new and different.  Really, in anything I tried to do to possibly make things better, I encountered a lot of inertia.  Granted, this may have been just the company I worked for, but before I got the full-time position, I interviewed at a few steel mills and they seemed to only want to ""fill in their ranks"" and do the same thing they've more or less always been doing.

In my last job, I really enjoyed the process development and manufacturing engineering aspects, so I think I'd like to do something like that but within the energy industry since it seems to be undergoing a lot of innovation right now.  I don't really want to work in the oil, gas, etc. industry for various reasons.

I don't think I'd enjoy going back to school to get my Master's, so I'd like to avoid that, if I could...

 [Thermodynamics ME 321/328](http://www.ohio.edu/mechanical/thermo/index.html) Dr. Izzy's thermo page. It's definitely good to start reading through some of the topics early. You'll need some calculus knowledge (integrals).

 [Kinematics/Dynamics, Vibrations, Controls, Robotics, Biomechanics](http://www.ohio.edu/people/williar4/html/Courses.html) Dr. Bob's course page. A solid understanding of MATLAB is required to do some of the examples. Much of it is supplemental to lectures and the textbook, but there's still useful information to be found. [Fortunately he includes a pretty good primer on MATLAB.](http://www.ohio.edu/people/williar4/html/PDF/MATLABPrimer.pdf)

 [Numerical Methods](http://www.math.ohiou.edu/courses/math3600/) Dr. Young's Math 3600 page. This class focuses on solving more tedious calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra problems using MATLAB, and introduces various aspects of using computers for numerical solving (error and the like).

Reddit just implemented the ability for subreddits to allow user-editable flair.  In other words, I no longer have to fulfill all your flair requests.  Which means I actually have to work at work.

To edit your flair, click edit next to your name on the right ----&gt;

I've provided several templates.  Those templates, based on experience, should cover 98% of flair needs.  Please choose one and fill in your discipline/subdiscipline/school as applicable.

Appropriate **disciplines** include civil, mechanical, aerospace, nuclear, chemical, software, electrical, computer, petroleum, industrial, and MORE.  You get the idea - likely it's what your degree says.  

Your **subdiscipline** is much more varied and specific, and could be anything from HVAC for an ME to Structural for a CE to Electronics for EE.  No subdiscipline is needed if you don't want it.

**Students** have flair options as well if you want to choose one.  You don't have to - you can just put down your discipline with no student or school tag if you want.

**RULES:**

- If you're unfamiliar with how the flair works here, look at other posts for examples of proper flair.  Look at mine, for example.  I use the ""Discipline1/Discipline2 - Subdiscipline"" template.

- Must be engineering flair, since this is AskEngineers.  Exceptions may apply if you work in a closely related field (drafter, for example), but please ask first.

- Follow formats provided, or please ask if you need to deviate.  Engineering IS all about standardization, right?  Keep the spacing correct.

- The word ""engineering"" or ""engineer"" is not needed in the flair, except in some occasional situations such as Materials Science and Engineering.

- Please nothing too ridiculously specific for the subdiscipline.  

- No PE, PEng, EIT, BS, MS, PhD, or other post-nominals.  This is not about credentials, it's about interest.

- Mods can and will edit or delete your flair if it violates the rules.

Feel free to ask any questions.

I have a wireless dog fence [like this one](http://store.petsafe.net/wireless-containment-system). We recently had cable internet installed and it changed the boundary of the fence. The cable seems to be acting like an antenna for the wireless transmitter. [See this diagram](http://i.imgur.com/TTGLEHq.png
) This has the affect of extending the boundary in an undesirable way. I am looking for ways to eliminate this interference.

So far I have tried:


* Checking the ground at the cable entrance to the house
* Grounding the shield of the cable nearest the transmitter
* Moving the transmitter as far away as practical from the cable lines inside the house


My next thoughts are to try a high-pass filter (the fence operates at 17.5kHz) or to pull up the outside cable and put it in metal conduit then rebury it.

1370948295.0,34,self.AskEngineers,1g43ir,"Why do we have limited color spaces and then engineer our displays to try and match those spaces, to the point where being able to display more colors is regarded as a bad thing, instead of targeting as our color space the full range of all visible colors?",caliber,43,9,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1g43ir/why_do_we_have_limited_color_spaces_and_then/,"I'm looking into color spaces for the first time and trying to wrap my head around the concepts. I'm presenting everything with simplifications, as I'm just trying to understand the big picture concept at the moment.

So in [this diagram](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Cie_Chart_with_sRGB_gamut_by_spigget.png), the big object is all visible colors, and the small triangle inside of it is the sRGB standard by which virtually all digital images are apparently defined. Under sRGB, for each point in an image, you have three values, indicating how strong the red, green, and blue are at that point.

From what I've been reading, for accurate display of colors, monitors and other displays are designed to match the sRGB color space as closely as possible. For professional work, there are other color spaces as well, such as Adobe RGB that has a wider coverage of visible colors, or CMYK that matches up better with inks that create color by subtracting from white.

However, if you view an sRGB image, on an Adobe RGB monitor, then the colors will appear oversaturated (and if you do the opposite they will appear dull). This is because the color space of sRGB is a smaller triangle than that of Adobe RGB, and so if you take the same numbers and plug them into Adobe RGB, you end up proportionally farther out from the center.

As a result, it is considered bad for a monitor to have a wider gamut in the visible color space than the color space you'll be working with, so if you're a consumer, you don't want a monitor that can display more colors than sRGB, as you'll end up with oversaturated images.

This can be compensated for by using color management, which is built into modern desktop OS's, and converts colors (such as sRGB colors from images on the Interent) into the same color on your monitor, allowing viewing of normal images on monitors with wider gamuts such as Adobe RGB-calibrated monitors, but most monitors don't ship with the profiles data to do this, and since almost all images are encoded in sRGB anyway, there isn't much incentive for the average user to buy a monitor that can do more.

All this leaves me with a question I'm having difficulty locating an answer to, which is why do we use these limited color spaces?

Instead of a limited color space, why don't we simply use the large object in the diagram, all visible colors? It seems that simply storing the x, y values of where a color is on that chart would be sufficient (along with brightness, transparency, etc.), and could even be used to store information on colors outside of the average human's visible field. Then, a display device could simply clip values outside of its own maximum capabilities, and more colors capable of being displayed would always be a good thing. Furthermore, there would be a single, universal, and permanent color space that all devices could refer to.

Are they a holdover from an era when it was prohibitive to include a chip to convert these values into something a given monitor would be capable of displaying?

When new standards for color spaces are being defined, such as Adobe RGB, why didn't they simply encompass the entire visible color space, instead of creating yet another limited subset of the space?",,False,self,t5_2sebk,False,,,True,t3_1g43ir,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1g43ir/why_do_we_have_limited_color_spaces_and_then/,

This helps me get ready and perform well in interviews and such.   I also have worked on several projects during my education career that test my engineering skills. But I feel like whenever employers ask about my GPA they immediately lose interest.

TL;DR What should I expect in terms of hard times in the near future due to my bad grades in college?

EDIT: Thanks for the encouragement and insight.

For others wondering the same stuff, the general consensus seems to be:

- may have closed some doors initially but hard work and getting experience through internships is the ticket out of the rut

- Be aggressive with your application process.  Don't wait around to hear from a particular employer.

- Focus on the things you are good at and make sure the interviewers know you are confident in those areas.

- Express your desire to perform well at their company and your excitement for the future.

I come across some automation machinery from countries in Europe (Germany and elsewhere) where the switching occurs after the load, rather than on the active side. 

This is unusual to me because here in Australia (and I think also in the UK, not sure about the USA) it is illegal to independently switch the neutral of a mains voltage circuit, and very unusual to switch the neutral/negative of a low voltage control circuit. It seems counter intuitive, and it is strange to us to troubleshoot the machine while testing with the high potential as a reference point.

I've even heard of Siemens electric trains (from Austria?) where they prefer to raise the potential of the neutral when dimming the drivers dashboard/control panel lighting, rather than lowering the potential of the active line like we would do here, which seems even more peculiar to me.

I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit for this, but I'm a little bit at wits end about this inquiry. Let me try to sum this up as briefly as possible:

I live in Japan, and moved from my tiny apartment to a big house across from my place of work about a month and a half ago.  This is what the exterior of the house looks like: http://i.imgur.com/653B21Sh.jpg  

I'm not an architect myself (so I'm sorry for my lack of technical knowledge!), but the house is built in a very common lightweight style for this area.  The frame is wood running into a concrete base, and I'm fairly sure the brown outside walls of the house are just drilled onto the wooden frame.  The house itself is 12 years old.  

I was so enamored with the great location and low price of the house that I did not notice some obvious flaws until I moved in.  The first, and scariest to me, is that the entire house shakes when a heavy truck comes rumbling by.  I'm OK with it happening when a truck goes down the street directly in front of the house, but the house can also shake quite violently when a truck drives slowly on the major road 2 lots away from the house.  My place of work also shakes when trucks go by directly out front, but to a far lesser extent than my house.  My place of work does not shake at all due to traffic on the major road.  

So here's where things get really dicey... there are cracks running through many of the walls and ceilings of the house, on both the first and second floors.  These lines are basically perfectly straight -- vertical on the walls, horizontal on the ceilings.  The walls in the hose seem to be in no way load-bearing, and are made of very lightweight material with wallpaper on top. (and no, they're not just edges of the wallpaper, which is what I'd initially hoped) This is a gallery of what they look like: http://imgur.com/a/aCSkM#653B21S  

A few more things about the house: it's located on a former rice field that had dirt piled on it, and then three houses built on top of it.  Some of the windows in the house, especially on the second floor, refuse to open/shut correctly, like the frame around it is warped; some of the doors also don't shut correctly as well.

Anyhow, I realize this is long, but my question is: **Is my house unsafe?**  They're starting construction on an apartment building on the lot directly next to mine next week, which means heavy equipment rumbling by on a daily basis for the next 4~5 months.  I hope I'm being paranoid, but between the shaking and the cracks, I'm not sure how the house will hold up to the stress of drilling, paving, and building literally feet from my door.  Everyone here has told me not to worry about it and they won't help me take any action (well, my Japanese friends, anyway), while my boss has expressed some minor concern about the cracks in the walls.  

Thanks for any help or advice you can provide.  I'll also gladly take more pictures if they'll help the diagnosis.  Also, if this is the wrong subreddit, if you could please point me in the right direction, that'd be great.  The Internet is full of signs of imminent building collapse, but basically only for big concrete buildings, and I'm in a bit of a different situation... thanks again! :)

I work in digital design (FPGA's) at a company that's a bit slow to update the way they do things. Most in the company are boomers, and millenials (and Gen X'ers, even) are a minority.

One of our goals is to maximize design and tool flow re-use across projects. When a new project starts, though, you can imagine I find myself amused and bemused when my senior engineers need to ramp up the next guy to their previous work. Because no ""wrap-up"" documentation was taken at the time of release, they have to fumble through their notebooks from 6-12 months ago, perform long Outlook e-mail searches, et al. It costs everyone time, and the next guy gets an incomplete, sub-optimal ""starter kit"".

My previous job (at a young company) made great use of internal wikis for knowledge-sharing. I'm hoping to create an internal wiki to mitigate these effects, and in the coming years, retain knowledge that may be otherwise lost due to a mass retirement exodus. I'm hoping many will create wikis for tool flows, starter guides to common IP, other useful processes.

If you already use or are adopting an internal wiki for similar purposes, I was curious of the following:
 
* How do you maximize buy-in, adoption, and contribution from co-workers, esp. the old guard?
* What overall pros/cons and lessons learned has your dept. realized from using one?
* To attempt to quantify the cost savings of an internal wiki, what sort of questions (say, by survey) are good to ask senior engineers, program architects, and the like? (e.g., ""How many hours are lost instead of gained when attempting design re-use?"")
* The current consensus is to use the Wiki features of SharePoint so that it's integrated into our intranet and all that. I know of other programs like MediaWiki...any opinions, preferences for SharePoint, MediaWiki, other?

I'm fresh out of college and working now for a manufacturing company that designs and builds mobile equipment. I raised a question today concerning our emergency stops, and I don't feel it was adequately answered (responses all seemed to be preference), so here we go.

Some background: the engine manufacturer recommends that emergency stops cut the ignition sense and power input lines (3-4) to the Engine Control Module (which can easily be done with a positive-guided relay), and then states quite clearly that there is no official recommendation for multiple e-stops.

The question: Surely there is some standard (or even an industry ""best practice"" for the wiring of emergency stops? Should they be wired in series with normally closed contacts, or in parallel with normally open contacts? One could go even further by using multiple contacts per operator in case of contact failure, or by using normally-open early-make contacts.

What minimum amount of resources would you need to eventually develop an industrial society?,unconscionable,43,13,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/119gqy/you_and_somewhere_between_200_to_1000_other/,"I've always been curious about how much we depend on existing infrastructure to perpetuate an industrial / post-industrial society. The idea isn't all that original either - think Robinson Crusoe, Swiss Family Robinson, and countless other fictional accounts. Perhaps it's something deep in our nomadic psyche that compels us to long for new lands. Perhaps it's just mere curiosity. Either way, it's the ultimate disaster recovery engineering challenge.. how could you rebuild everything we have now if it were all destroyed without, well, taking 100,000 years or however long it took our species to do it naturally?

If we were to strip away all our infrastructure and all we had were our brains and plenty of hands, could we rebuild it quick enough to prevent slipping back into the stone age? What sorts of limitations would you run into?

Let's say you and a small population were transported to an earth-like planet (for the sake of simplicity, let's try to eliminate as many weird variables as possible.. for all intensive purposes, let's just assume this other place is basically planet earth minus all human influence). What could you do with little more than the knowledge that you have? If it makes a difference, suppose you have a couple trinkets from earth. Maybe a laptop that has an archive of wikipedia and a handful of engineering / science textbooks? 

Unless hunting &amp; gathering seemed to be an easier solution for the medium term, my first goal would be 1. start farming, and 2. animal husbandry. Once food / shelter are figured out, I'd try and build some sort of [bloomery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomery), and attempt to smelt iron ore or whatever types of metallic ore I can find. (I suspect iron ore looks something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/0NTLo.png) so I'll know how to identify it in the wild.) Then I'd try to figure out a way to turn that smelted metal into wire. Then I'd try and find a magnetic rock (which for all I know would be as difficult as finding a gold nugget in the woods). Then I'd try to use my wire and magnetic rock to build an electric generator, and build a water wheel or something to power it. Not quite sure what i'd do from there, but hopefully from there I can at least figure out a way to charge the laptop without blowing it up.

Pretty sure I'm not capable of doing all that with what I know right now, but hopefully I'm not the smartest one in the colony.. and hopefully the area we're transported to is rich with natural resources! At any rate, if I could accomplish all that, I suspect that could at least get us to the 15th century or so. Maybe my next goal would be to try and build a transistor, although I suspect that would take considerable more infrastructure to create [after looking at a picture of the first transistor built](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg).

We're opening up the option for you engineers and non-engineers out there to add some flair to your username on AskEngineers.  The idea is to not recognize any sort of expertise or professional licensure, but just as a note of area of interest in engineering.  Having flair is **not** any sort of endorsement of the validity of an answer you may provide.  Instead, we see it as a way to increase community and show some pride for one's engineering field.

Since it's not about expertise and knowledge, non-engineers can get flair too if you want it.  High school student interested in electrical engineering?  Go for it.

The format is &lt;General discipline&gt; - &lt;Sub-discipline&gt;.  So, if you're a geotechnical engineer, Civil - Geotechnical would probably be most appropriate.  You don't have to put a sub discipline if you don't want to.  And you don't have to have any flair at all if you don't want to.

Here's what I came up with off the top of my head for disciplines and sub-disciplines (in parentheses).  Of course, there are more I didn't list.  Let's not get too specific on the sub-disciplines, please.  You may be a geotech specializing in seismic analysis in Antarctica, but let's just stick to geotech.

- Mechanical (Thermal, Piping, HVAC)

- Aeronautical/Astronautical

- Civil (Structural, Geotechnical, Transportation)

- Nuclear

- Chemical (Process)

- Biological

- Environmental

- Computer

- Software

- Electrical (Power, Electronics)

- Petroleum

- Industrial


And if you notice my flair, I put Civil/Mechanical because I can't really classify myself distinctly as either.  That may apply to others as well and that's fine.  Just keep it reasonable.

**Reply to this post** with your flair if you want some.  I'll do my best to apply the flair as quickly as possible but there may be a delay, especially if you post toward the end of the week.  I'll delete the replies as they are completed.

We may colorize or change it up in the future, but for now we're keeping it simple.

Like dwarves from high-fantasy.",caliber,31,5,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1fx8ov/would_it_be_possible_to_build_a_selfsustaining/,"**Water**

Let's start by assuming the presence of an underground river or other major subterranean water source nearby, since they're fairly common, and otherwise it seems unlikely that sufficient water would be present to sustain a community.

**Light**

The first major issue that jumps out at me is light. In order to sustain lighting, which would be necessary in almost all waking hours, it seems like some method of electricity generation would be necessary.

The most plausible electricity sources seem like underground rivers and geothermal activity. If we already have an underground river,  harnessing it for power seems like a sensible step.

**Food**

The next major issue I think would be food. Judging from existing troglodytic creatures, the ability to forage for food is very, very limited and only able to support the most meager existence. That doesn't strike me as enough to support even a single human, let alone a whole community.

However, if there is already a power source capable of generating light, that seems like it could be used to serve as the basis for farming of some type. Things I immediately wonder are if that could be done at a sufficient efficiency to support a community, whether it would contain sufficient nutrients for survival, and what the plants or fungi or whatever is being farmed would require in terms of a substrate on which to grow.

If the underground river is bringing in fish and other food sources from the outside, that seems like a great way to get a ton of nutrition, though might be considered cheating a bit on the problem.

**Air**

It seems like caves, even very deep ones, never run into the problem of air failing to circulate sufficiently for people to breathe, but is there a limit to this that would become significant?

**Other**

The power generation and lighting would require a fair bit of technology to work. Once the community has been surviving for a few years, would it be plausible for them to develop enough manufacturing capability to generate replacement parts for wear, and new items for expansion?

I'm studying the stress created in a standard 2x4 LEGO brick when connected to another standard 2x4 brick.  I know that this connection is maintained because of an interference fit and friction, but I'm wondering what kind of simple hand calculations I can do to validate the FEA model I'll eventually make.

My thoughts originally pointed me toward a comparison to some kind of pressure vessel, but now I'm thinking I can model the outer faces of the top brick as cantilever beams undergoing a deflection caused by the pegs on the lower brick, then calculating the forces and moments caused by this deflection.

Any thoughts?  Thank you!

[Edit]: Even if you don't think you know what you're talking about,  I welcome all bits of insight or ideas!

[Edit2]: To be clear, I am talking about the stresses existing in the top block simply due to the fact that the second block is being wedged in its bottom. (Not interested in making that sound less silly)

[Edit3]: So you all know, LEGO bricks are not held together by cylindrical press fits per se, as pegs to not enter holes on other bricks.

1368681025.0,26,self.AskEngineers,1efner,"Just got an offer from a defense contractor, should I accept it or ask for more?",GotAnOffer,39,13,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1efner/just_got_an_offer_from_a_defense_contractor/,"I've been working for the government as an engineer for about 4 years now, and I've pretty much maxed out my career path. The only way I can get a large raise now would be by becoming a team lead (positions don't come up very often) or a supervisor (not really interested, **and** don't come up often). So I started applying to private sector jobs a few months ago.

Earlier this month I scored a phone interview, followed by an in-person interview, followed by another in-person interview with my would-be boss and his chief engineer. Apparently they liked me and pushed me through HR. I did all the normal background check type stuff and just got an offer today.

First of all, it's a pretty decent raise in base pay, roughly 20% more than I'm making now. However, I'm not just interested in the base pay.

At my current cushy government job I earn about 4 weeks of vacation a year plus 13 days of sick leave. The new job will only get me 3 weeks per year until I've been there for 5 year (and only 2 weeks for the first year).

I also won't get as good of retirement benefits, the government job has a ""free"" pension that you get put into for working X years, as well as 5% matched in a 401k. The new job gives a 3% match in a 401k until I've been there for 5 years, when it goes up to 4%.

Life/Health/Dental/Vision insurance are just about a wash between the two, roughly the same options and about the same benefits paid by employer.

So if I take the new job I lose out on sick time, some vacation time, and some retirement benefits, but I get a substantial pay raise out of the gate, and more potential pay the longer I stay with them.

As for the job itself, the government job is boring. It's easy, and it's laid back, but it's also not challenging in the least, and I'm using less and less ""engineering skills"" each year and it's becoming more and more bureaucracy. I'm honestly a little worried that if I stay with the government job for too much longer I literally won't be able to go into an engineering career because my skills will have totally atrophied. Meanwhile the new job sounds exciting and fun, but could very well just be a case of the grass being greener. I have some friends that work in the same department I'd be going into, and they obviously have their own complaints, but they've been there for about 5 years now and still enjoy it.

So, does this vague description sound like a good idea? Has anyone else transferred from government bureaucracy into the private sector and enjoyed it (or hated it)? Should I try and negotiate anything else into the offer? This is the initial offer and I have a couple days before I need to respond. Is there anything else I should compare between the two jobs? The commute is about the same for each, and if I got the new job I might be able to carpool.

I was the kid that skipped every single class that I could get away with, only really showed up for tests and major assignments, and was happy to coast by on a 54%. I fell into a reasonably well paying job almost right after graduation that allowed me to coast along again for far longer than I should have without doing something that actually interests me. It's time to change that. I'm scrambling a bit to try and get my application in for this fall, and I'm wondering if I'm making the right choice.

I've always thought engineering would be perfect for me. I love math, it was the course I managed to pull off 80s in while still skipping about 1/3 of the time and putting in basically no effort. I also really like understanding how and why things work the way they do. I feel like the biggest thing that has held me back from doing this until now is fear of failure. It's an intimidating program. But that's a stupid reason not to do something!

My question is what can I actually expect out of a career in engineering. I'm still unsure of whether or not I want to do mechanical or electrical. I'm leaning pretty far towards mechanical. I don't think I want to do chemical (don't want to work for an oil company) or civil (don't want to work for the government). But I feel like I may have an overly romantic idea of what MEs do. I worry that it's less hands on than I want it to be and far more sitting at a desk doing math. I'm not afraid of the leg work, but what draws me to the field is the idea of building something new. Creating something that will better the lives of others. I want to build robot pants for paraplegics, or 300hp engines that get 200mpg, or silent wind turbines that don't piss off the neighbours, or a suction cup that actually holds the GPS to the window... Is this realistic or will I actually be spending 20 or 30 years redesigning and then redesigning again the same slightly stronger slightly lighter steering control arm for a ford focus?

The local bike shop sells these big iron magnets you can attach to your bike to help trigger the sensors, but I'm wondering if he would be better served with some other material.

My understanding is that the sensors are likely large inductive loops, and the magnetic permeability of the material is what determines if the sensor will pick it up.

Out of the blue I get a phone call from a former work acquaintance. They have this massive project that the company has decided to seriously invest in. I've worked with the technology before, it's very unique. Probably ten people in the US have worked with it before.

Also they are throwing in a generous sign on bonus. I can't really say no to the new offer.

But, here's my issue, I feel guilt for leaving a great position now. My current department is understaffed but we barely manage. I'm going to blindside my manager and leave him in a tough spot. I've had recruiters get the point across that it's never a good time to leave a company if you're a good employee, you'll always have responsibility and it will always hurt someone's timeline, but I still don't know how I'm going to look my manager in the eye when I have the ""two week talk"".

1346107315.0,23,self.AskEngineers,yxfqi,I need the advice of a few engineers.,ThunderNuggetSupreme,32,9,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/yxfqi/i_need_the_advice_of_a_few_engineers/,"I've been lurking here for a while (just made this account), engineering and it's various disciplines have fascinated me for a long time. I need your advice guys.

I need to know if it is worth my time and effort to study to join your exalted brotherhood. I'm thirty five and I'm married with children so I'm not a typical student that comes on here asking for advice. I have some college behind me, but no degree, when I was in school fifteen years ago my real major area of interest was getting laid. So I was a pre-law student and as such not required to take as much math as you would think a lawyer may need. I'm guessing it's going to take four and a half to five years to earn my degree, because I can't double up much of the math I have to take. 

Why am I doing this?  Because I have to do something and whatever I train to do now is what I'm going to have to do for the rest of my working life. I have been a very successful locksmith for quite a few years. I have even worked closely with various engineers over the years designing custom locking systems for various things. Aircraft to Zoo's, I've secured them all. In a normal locksmiths progression you will always eventually work for yourself, it's the only way to earn in the eighty to one-hundred thousand a year range in that industry. Unfortunately for me about ten years ago I was diagnosed with RA, and it has progressed to the point that the fine motor skills I need to do the work is failing. So I know I have to retrain myself to do something else, and I have to do it now. It was like being twenty years old again, coming to that realization, when I was twenty I had been in college for two years and was absolutely sure I didn't want to be a lawyer anymore. I was able to get my first locksmithing job and just shelved school until I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. So here and now, I want to be an engineer, but I'm not sure if I should  follow this dream or not. I guess you could say my health and my looming failings in my long time profession have created something of a mid-life crisis for me, so rather than seek advice from a doctor I've decided to ask you engineers of reddit your opinions. I like how engineers get to the heart of the matter, rather than giving someone a bullshit boost of confidence. I'll list some bullet points to help break all this down.

So here are my questions:

1). At 35 years old estimating it's going to take 4 to 5 years to finish a BS degree in engineering and expecting to work until 65 or 70 years old is it worth it?
     A&gt; I will have to use student loans, I'm guessing at the end of this time I will have             between 40K and 60K in loans.
     B&gt; I do live in an area with a strong job market for engineers, specific disciplines asked for often are mechanical, aerospace, electrical, some but less civil and always software engineers. 
     C&gt; 'Worth' in this context means is the income to investment sound considering age, length of time expected to be in the field, and expected debt accrued to reach goal.

2). Given point B above I have looked at what ""kind"" of engineer I'd want to be. I have to enter into this with a plan. I've looked over the university web-sites and while their overviews are ""nice"" they aren't really informative. In fact going by them I would expect to work in groups of attractive and diverse smiling people who like to gather around tables. From what I've read most of the disciplines overlap and a mechanical engineer is considered a ""jack of all trades"" engineer?  So here is the actual question:* What discipline would you most want to do from mechanical, aerospace, electrical or software?* If you work in a different field that you would like to tell me about and why it's worth the extra effort to get into it please do.

Some companies are now offering solar systems up to 5kW.

I imagine that peak load for the electricity grid is probably when people cook their evening meals. And a lot of houses around my city are connected to gas mains, and therefore have fewer electrical heating/water heating/cooking appliances, which I expect means less off peak load when there is no hot water storage drawing around 3kW when the thermostat clicks on.

Assuming photovoltaic panels continue to get cheaper, could there be a scenario where too many people have too many solar panels and the generation in the middle of the day exceeds the load in the neighbourhood? Or can the energy travel as far as required, to somewhere where it can be consumed by industry? 

As an additional question, does the energy company monitor/control this grid fed solar energy from consumers, and can it disrupt normal operations, or does the inverter simply only supply the current that is necessary for the loads within range? And can that solar energy flow backward through distribution transformers to feed distant loads, stepping up to distribution voltage (11kV here in Aus). 

If the power from the solar inverter only provides the current that is required (can be consumed by nearby houses/loads) on the local low voltage (240/415v here in Aus) system then are we looking at people not getting the expected generation/payback from their solar systems, once almost everybody has one?

So a kind of funny back story.  I often ride my motorcycle to work and today I had to stop by our data-center.  The data-center is unmanned and requires badge access to get through the parking lot gate.  The gate, 8' tall chain link, actuator arm that pivots it up.  To leave, instead of a badge reader, there is an inductive loop sensor in the concrete at the gate. Drive up and the gate opens automatically... except if you're on a motorcycle.  I had to hop off, go to the actuator control box, open it up, hit the manual open button, move the bike out, go back in, hit the close button, secure the box, and duck under the closing gate before it crushed me.

I've researched this a little online and people suggest using a few neodymium magnets on the bottom of the bike.  But I don't see how a permanent magnet is going to help trip this sensor.  Can it? if not, is there something I can create that will?  It doesn't need to be something bike mounted, it could be a device I just keep in my saddle bags and trigger it by hand.

Not for real implementations though, seeing as I'm not really qualified (professionally and politically) for it, but at least to spur the discussion among other interested wannabe-urbanists.

So, one specific solution would require a 250m-long 17% grade to be climbed by a rail-like system. Now, I know for a fact that no rail system can deliver 17% grade climbing without it being some sort of rack railway but, seeing as elevated railway is acceptable, one option is to start the climb ""earlier"" and have a shallower grade for a longer run.

The problem, however, is that this would require a long and tall viaduct to be built, with several tall and obtrusive pillars holding the railway itself. So I thought to myself: if we want to save on building several pillars, why not build a cable-stayed structure then? That's where I hit a wall: I know that cable-stayed bridges have been built, with ginormous spans, but they're usually flat. All my googling couldn't find any example of a hill-climbing cable-stayed bridge.

So that's my question: would that design be sensible? The relevant elevation profile can be seen here http://i.imgur.com/DAUWhF6.png, already with a poorly-drawn tentative profile for the viaduct and its cable-staying structure.

Any thoughts?

I've been thinking, would it be better instead to make the drive train and everything else electric by throwing all of the engine's power into a huge alternator instead (similar to how it is done on huge diesel train engines)? In this way you could optimize the engine specifically for generating power, and not worry about the demand of accelerating/cruising etc. Of course though, this would require a battery and all the other things that come along with electric cars.

",SwimsLikeAx,28,5,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/rjw36/what_is_it_like_to_be_a_mechanical_engineer/,"Hey Reddit,

I am currently trying to decide which career path best suits me, and I would like the input of any mechanical engineers. My questions: what is your day to day job like, what really gets you excited about your job, what do you hate the most, what problems/puzzles do you solve in your line of work, how did you know that you wanted to be a mechanical engineer, and were your expectations met?


I am currently in a chemistry Ph.D. program, but I have recently realized that this is not a good path for me. I am very practically minded (I don't get excited about science just for science's sake), and I like working on physical puzzles (space requirements, structural needs, mechanical movements...). I think I am best suited for mechanical engineering, although this would require a significant amount of extra schooling. 


Mechanical engineering appeals to me because (from what I believe it to be) it is the kind of work I can really get lost in. I could spend hours on end designing my own lego creations, building something in woodshop, building my own computer, or rebuilding a lawn mower engine. I think the same sort of puzzles and motivations that applied to those activities apply to mechanical engineering. I would like to be very certain of my choice since pursuing mechanical engineering would involve dropping out of a great Chemistry Ph.D. program, and starting over at the undergrad level at the  age of 25 or 26. Please, let me know your thoughts.

I'm looking for some solid advice on how to accept an offer from a company for which I've been ""interning"" for the last year and a half.  Although the offer they extended is a raise from my current pay rate, I feel it is far below average salaries for entry level BSMEs in my area (San Jose, Silicon Valley).  

I've been doing research on websites like Salary.com, Indeed.com, EngineeringSalary.com, and PayScale.com.  What I have found is that there are wildly different predictions on what I should make, here is a summary of this data:

All sites were supplied with the same information:

* Mechanical Engineer I
* 1 year experience (actually been interning at this company 2.5 years)
* 100-250 employees
* San Jose, CA
* Degree from Santa Clara University (top 20)



* Salary.com: **72k**
* Indeed.com: **101k** &lt;--- WTF? Sounds unreasonable
* EngineeringSalary: **75k** 
* Payscale: **54k**
* Homefair.com **72k**
* JobSearchIntelligence.com **68k** &lt;--bottom 10th percentile, 90k median

My current offer is for 63k which is 5k more than I make as an hourly intern.  The benefit package is just about the best you can get (profit sharing, stock purchase, even education and veterinarian)

My question is this:  How do I present this information to attempt a massive renegotiation of the offer?  I myself do not trust the accuracy of these websites and wonder if there is a better data set I can present.  Is it unreasonable to ask for at least 70k?  What do other low level experience MEs make (if you feel like divulging that info)

Any advice, experiences, data etc. is greatly appreciated, I really don't want to get screwed on my 1st offer. 

Thanks!

**edit:**  Wow, thanks for all the advice everyone.  To fill you all in, I did compile all the information from my research and presented it to my manager.  He was surprised that I was attempting to renegotiate but entirely willing to hear me out and let me say my part.  Basically the gist of the argument was that our company does not fully compensate salaries based on the cost of living adjustment in the area.  There is a small bonus for employees in San Jose ~6%, far below the COLA of about 50%.  He took my argument upwards and I ended up with an offer for 65k.  
I think the take away here is that **it never hurts to do your research and learn more about what your company will and will not do for you**  Had I just accepted I would've left money on the table and not had the experience of learning how they came up with my offer.  I'm happy with how this turned out and grateful to all you reddit engineers for giving me the courage to just go for it.

I recently accepted a new position and now am trying to piece together a knowledge of vibration. So far I've figured out most of what I need, but there's still one piece I'm struggling with. 

Our parts are qualified in via a shaker test for 10 hours at a given PSD. I analyze them first to find problem spots early and fix them before they fail on the actual table. The analysis technique is explained fairly well in [this demo, put out by ANSYS](http://www.ansys.com/staticassets/ANSYS/staticassets/resourcelibrary/article/AA-V2-I3-Random-Vibration-Fatigue.pdf). 

Essentially, the square root of the area under response PSD curve is the ""1-sigma"" stress - 68% of the time the stress is under that value, 27% of the time it's below ""2-sigma"", and 4% of the time it's under ""3-sigma"". Then, for the full test, you take (10 hours)\*(natural frequency)\*.68 to determine how many cycles it experiences at 1-sigma; do the same for 2- and 3-sigma; then apply Miner's Rule to determine whether the part would fail during the test. 

Where I'm unsure how to proceed is when there are multiple significant natural frequencies. Our geometry typically has 2 or 3 modes which have similar magnitude stress responses. My thought is to break the response PSD into pieces and treat each peak separately - find the 1-sigma associated with frequency 1, 1-sigma with frequency 2, etc. and do the above calculations again. However, that doesn't seem to account for when the two frequencies are in phase, when most of the damage would occur. 

Any thoughts/suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!

At first I didn't understand why a telegraph message could take so long but as I researched it more, I realized it was because the signal was so weak and diffuse that they kept having to ask them to repeat words (Mostly due to the capacitance of the line).  After some research it appears they were using 600 volts DC, the cable was 2050 miles long, it had a resistance of 23 Kohms and a capacitance of 300 microfarad.  

My questions:  If modern EEs had to work with that cable today, could we improve signal throughput and how? Is there anything we know now that might have helped them back then?

I'm super proud of him and want to keep encouraging this creative desire while trying to gently tell him that the coil will probably not bring in much for wattage. His reponse? He goes to Radioshack and comes back with [magnet wire](http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2036277) and a neodymium magnet half the size of my pinky finger.

Anyway, we're about to wrap the coil and I realized I'm not quite so sure of myself as I thought. I haven't got a clue the best way to wrap this wire, and I have no idea how to best test this coil once we get it working!


I have only basic tools available to me. Most of what I have I've stripped out of household electronics. I have capacitors, diodes, motors, LEDs, resistors and all those goodies but *no oscilloscope* and only a janky little multimeter to work with. (Yeah I know, my tools suck. I lost a lot of stuff to chlorine gas recently and I'm rebuilding my tool set)


To determine the maximum power output of the coil, I was thinking of building [this circuit](http://i.imgur.com/Xs7BT.jpg) and measuring at the three marked points as the bro shakes the coil - pretty standard, but I'm worried about diode losses and capacitive losses as unknown factors. Depending on how much voltage/amperage we can get out of this coil, I will buy the necessary components from DigiKey (if the voltage is high, we go with a 7805. If the voltage is low, we build a simple boost converter) and go from there.

**Future plans**

I will attempt to construct the UAV in detail with Inventor in the near future, I will keep you guys updated!

**Hardware:**

ARMv9 dual-core 1GHz SOC (ultra-low power) + arduino combo (high/low level control) running linux with
1 x 3-axis accelerometer/3D magnetometer 1 x 3-axis gyrometer 1 x pressure sensor 1 x GPS

Pan/Tilt/Zoom frontal camera

Ubiquity Bullet M2 long range wifi

3 x EDF each with 17N maximum thrust

2 x 6800mAh Li-Po battery

Carbon fibre frame and exterior

**Specifications:**

[figure 1, Dimensions](http://i.imgur.com/VpuAi.png) (in cm)

Conservative estimations:

I am no aero expert so please correct me if I am wrong, consider only the effective wing area on either side of EDF and negligible tail stabiliser, this would place CG 8.66cm from wing root LE (figure 1). Comparing this with the calculated centre of mass labelled CG in figure 1, it would appear they are in close proximity. (I assume this would be the point?)

Without considering any fuselage lift, the wings alone provides 85.352 sq.in (5.5 sq.dm) of area coupled with 2.5kg estimated total weight, I calculated the wing loading to be 455 g/sq.dm and a stall speed of 97.2 km/h (within reasonable range to my understanding.)

I am not sure about lift and drag calculations but I will give it a shot, ρ = 1.08 at 1000ft@15C and V = 100km/h = 27.78 m/s (is this reasonable for true air speed?) coef of lift = 1.5 , coef of drag = 0.15 at 15 degree angle of attack. area of wings = 0.01596 m^2 , area of wings + fuselage = 0.04429m^2

[figure 2, 15 degree angle of attack](http://i.imgur.com/YXjDB.png)

lift force = ½ρV^2 × coefficient of lift × area
            = 0.5x1.08x27.78sq2 x 1.5 x 0.01596
            = 9.98N

drag force = ½ρV^2 × coefficient of drag × area
            = 0.5x1.08x27.78sq2 x 0.15 x 0.04429
            = 2.77N

I know brass is an alloy of copper and zinc, so I assume brass is made by heating them both up together, until they melt, stir it abit, then let it cool? -Sorry for the vague assumptions but thats what i've gathered from wikipedia.

However, when I was looking around for more info, I discovered copper has a melting point of ~1000C, while zinc's is only ~400C (and it's boiling point is just 900C!)

So if you are heating up copper (in a furnace or whatever) to 1000C to melt it properly, then you add some zinc, won't the zinc just boil into (toxic?) fumes instead of melt and mix to make brass?

Basically what i'm asking is why the zinc melts with copper into brass instead of boiling into fumes, as 1000C to melt copper is bigger than zinc's boiling point?

It's somewhat like a playing card on bike spokes, and it starts and stops intermittently. The odd thing is, I can (via the magnets) feel the field from the power supply changing from a fairly consistent buzz to a much more pronounced on-off type of buzz, with the same frequency as the static ""spots"" in the audio. When I unplug the supply from the laptop, the audio spots remain, while the charger obviously peters out. When I plug it back in, the charger syncs back to the frequency of the audio spots until they stop.

I've been doing some research on this, but I'm not confident in my ability to actually make one of these yet.

First step was to view the wikipedia article for a heads up display: [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heads_up_display).  This makes it seem like HUD is relatively simple.  You take a source and project it onto a piece of glass and make sure it's focused to whatever distance you want it to appear in front of you.

The next step was to do some reddit searching.  I located [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/mxy83/question_about_hud_on_motorcycle_helmets/) post which discusses why no company is developing them commercially, not a lot of good information in terms of the engineering involved though.
[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/lelsh/i_want_to_create_a_helmet_with_a_hud/) post has even less information.  It's some high school students who want to make an HMD (helmet mounted display) and have no idea what they're doing.

Then it was off to Google.  I located one commercial product called ""night driver"" which apparently projects an infrared camera view onto the bottom of your windshield.  It appears to require professional installation, the product website is broken (multiple images do not load), and there's no mention of focusing distance.  This was not helpful, at all.

There's a lot of people that take their GPS unit, place it on the dash facing towards the windshield, and call it a HUD.  This is ridiculous for several reasons:  
1) The distance from windshield to apparent image is the same as the distance from windshield to GPS unit.  This places the image about 6 inches in front of the windshield, not helpful at all.  
2) Even light to moderate sun glare destroys the image completely.  
3) Hard to operate the GPS when it's lying upside down over the steering wheel.  

There was someone online making a HMD with beam splitters and ""pico projectors"", but he was none to specific as to his design.  He had some drawings (in MS paint, not technical drawings), but absent was any mention of how to focus the display properly.  His blog has not been updated in some years, I have no idea if his idea went anywhere.


Now, specifications:  
- Ideally, I'd like to project the display onto either my windshield or a flip-down or fold-up combiner.  I have access to the machine shop at my university, so I can manufacture any brackets, mounts, etc.  
- Eventually I'd like to project GPS instructions onto the display, but initially projecting anything (even some stock text) is acceptable.  Projecting my current speed would be a good first/second step, if possible.  
- Must be tolerant of moderate sun glare.  I don't necessarily need to drive straight into a sunset, but the quality of my display must not be dependent on the exact position of the sun during the afternoon.  
- Must be capable of focusing the image to approx. 50-100 feet in front of the car. *(reasoning below)  I'd like to be able to adjust the focus on the fly (with some kind of knob), but this is not required.  However, I must be able to adjust the focus without a huge amount of effort (i.e. no removing the unit, drilling new mounting holes, remounting, etc.).  
- Color projection is nice, but not necessary.  Monochrome is fine.  (Besides, the green text lets you pretend you're flying a fighter jet, and that's cool)  
- Must not cost a huge amount of money.  I have (essentially) free access to spare materials like wood, metal, and a piece of standard house window glass (I can't damage/cut it), various tools, a machine shop for prototyping purposes.  


My current idea:
Mount a ""pico-projector"" (""handheld"" projector) above my head and project it onto a flip-down piece of glass.  (Perhaps special glass. e.g. beam splitter, coated to reflect a specific wavelength, etc).  The projector will be driven by an old laptop.
However, I'm not certain at all as to how this is focused.  Can I simply adjust the focus on the lens to adjust the apparent distance to the image or is there more to it than that?  Will I need additional lenses?  I'm a mech-E student, but have a severely limited knowledge regarding optics.

Any advice or other ideas would be much appreciated.  Has anyone done anything like this previously?  In the spirit of maker culture and for the benefit of everyone I will report all progress on this idea.  All designs will be released to the public.




* My reasoning for this is that a HUD should prevent you from having to refocus your eyes to read information.  In an aircraft this is pretty straight forward, just focus the image to infinity because that's where you're looking almost the entire time.  In a car this is more difficult because you're looking at signs, the car in front of you, the car next to you, etc. all at different distances.  In traffic, above 30 MPH or so, you're going to be looking about 50-100 feet to the next car.  I probably won't use the HUD below about 20 MPH.  (If I had a budget and resources I'd incorporate an eye-tracker to focus the image onto whatever you're looking at, but this is way outside the scope of a DIY project)",,False,self,t5_2sebk,False,,,True,t3_njuhl,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/njuhl/i_want_to_make_a_hud_for_my_car/,

I am thinking that part of this is caused simply by use, as the kids run and play on it the particles self-sort and fill the spaces between particles more closely and therefore allow less movement of the bulk.  I also suspect that dust/dirt/debris of fine grain enhances filling in the inter-particle spaces and adds to the problem.  

My current solution is to run a hydraulic rototiller through the sand to ""fluff it"" but this is difficult, expensive and does not last but a short period of time before it is compacted and hard again.  

So I am seeking insight.  I was thinking about conducting an experiment in a section of one of the playgrounds where we try possible solutions.  the main one i have come up with so far is watering the sand to attempt to wash out the finer grained particles.  I would run a sprinkler maybe twice a week for 15 or so minutes and see of this has any affect.  I was also thinking of pressure washing a 10'x10' section and see if this did anything as well.

Last year I removed all of the sand in one of the playgrounds and replaced with p-gravel.  This helps considerably but it still compact a fair amount and is no where near as nice for the kids to play and build on.  

I was thinking that this forum might have a solution that I am not aware of.  Maybe a chemical that can be sprayed on the sand to lessen friction?  Or the addition to the sand of another material that would lessen the compaction ability (I was thinking the little rubber micro-beads they use in artificial turf).

The system has a lot of components but if I simplify things to just an RF synthesizer going into a baseband amplifier and then into our RF spectrum analyzer, I still see the noise even if the RF synthesizer is completely powered down. When I then unplug the synthesizer from the wall, the noise goes away. This makes me pretty sure it's not coming from the amplifier. 

[Here's a graph](http://imgur.com/jWE5JSu) showing the noise and noise floor.

I've been looking at signals from DC to 2 MHz but there is significant noise all the way up to 100 MHz. Another ""test"" that I've done is shorting the RF spectrum analyzer directly to ground, with no amplifier and the same spectrum appears. Not sure if that's significant.

I've also tested the outlets with a voltmeter and there is between 100 mV and 200 mV between the ground and neutral holes in different outlets throughout the building. I thought this is supposed to be zero? I tested the outlet with an outlet tester from the hardware store and it says it's working fine.

I work in a lab at a University so I have to wait until we can get someone to come out and take a look but any help or other test suggestions would be appreciated.

**EDIT**:

I've done some more tests. I was able to connect wires coming directly out of the wall to our oscilloscope. Here are the time and frequency domain plots:

I was also able to run the entire previously described setup off of batteries using uninterruptable power supplies. Here are plots from the RFSA showing the difference.

[No Batteries on the left, Batteries on the Right](http://imgur.com/NbAn0Je)

Different outlets around the lab that lead to different breaker switches in the breaker box contribute to different features in the noise spectrum as well. I think I will be looking into the DC chokes on the power outlets as suggested by kilovolt and mantra. I'm also looking at noise on a 10 GHz signal but have to mix down to DC to look at the noise. I'll be using high pass filters and bias tees on the high frequency stuff and try to run the low frequency things off of batteries.

I've got a setup which essentially amounts to an over-sized air canon. We've got a clear PVC tube about 3m long and maybe 30cm in diameter. We build up air pressure in a tank behind the tube with the two separated by a membrane. When the pressure reaches 20psi we pop the membrane.

Before we go any farther though I thought I'd ask the experts: How would you guys go about doing this, is there a simpler way to prove the wave is supersonic? If our way looks like the best, what types of transducers would you look into purchasing? And on the measuring side, what brand or type of hardware and software should we look at?

1. Confirm or deny that the wave is supersonic

Can anybody point me in the direction of online papers or sources comparing their electrical and mechanical reliability?

For a lab building in-house, one-off electronics, wire wrap has great advantages: we've got the tools to do it ourselves and repairs/component replacements are easy. PCBs are much cheaper and quicker to produce on a large scale, but I'm talking about producing single devices and their prototypes.

The perception of wire wrap in my environment seems to be that it’s just a wire wrapped around a post: that the electrical contact of two metals touching cannot be trusted; that the wire will simply go loose over time; that the freely moving wires and thin insulation introduce a greater risk of arcing.

Are these valid criticisms?

As a show that I’ve done my due diligence in searching for the answers to my own questions, the following are the resources I’ve found so far:

[The only clear comparison I've found](http://www3.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol43-1964/articles/bstj43-3-1067.pdf) concluded that wire wrapped and soldered connections are not significantly different in terms of passing fatigue tests. This is promising, but it's from 1964.

NASA has used wire wrap connections, and has [requirements of its workmanship]( http://workmanship.nasa.gov/lib/insp/2%20books/links/sections/301_Discrete%20Wiring.html), which is also promising. It’d seal the deal in terms of mechanical reliability if wire wrap were space-travel-worthy, but can anybody confirm that it’s used in space or just at NASA’s ground facilities?

In terms of electrical reliability, Martin Tarr of the Univ. of Bolton [describes wire wrapping]( http://www.ami.ac.uk/courses/topics/0117_wiwr/index.html) as a matter of the square post biting into the wire and thus bypassing any oxidation layer that might be present. This indicates a much more reliable connection than a wire simply touching a metal post. Tarr [references a book]( http://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Assembly-Soft-Soldering-Wrapping/dp/0132487667) on wire wrap, but it is out of print and not available in any libraries I have access to.

I've told my supervisor (a different person than the team lead) about working with other groups, but he's just pointed me back to stick with the same group.  I think several people have left the group in the past.

I've spent about a few months researching a new line of research, and not too long ago I presented it to my team lead (got to go through chain of command right?).  Since then, I've been writing proposals and powerpoint presentations for it, and he's been putting his name on it and presenting the work with me, with his name first and my name second.  It was a practice that I didn't really like, but I went along with it anyway in hopes I could get funding from management.  

However a few weeks ago, I got invited to a high level meeting to offer support to one of the departments, and he saw me there.  He then promptly tried to get me banned.  

At this point I have had it with working with this group.  I've gone to the supervisor and asked to work with other groups, but again he's doing nothing but dragging his feet (or even acknowledging any issues).

I was having a discussion with one of my friends who is an engineering major. I tutor him in his vector (ie multivariable) calculus class, and he has an unappealing propensity to only want to know the steps, out of context, required to solve a problem.

For example: Doing multiple integrals? In that case, multiply this by that. Take an integral of that. Plug this into here. Why? ""I don't know, but it's I need to do next, and it works on every problem like this.""

Whenever I try to get him to have a more solid and broad understanding of whatever subject we're going over, it always falls back on the fact that engineers don't need to know the ""why""'s behind things. Somebody else has already figured that out, and it's not the engineer's job to ""reinvent the wheel.""

He believes memorization of which formulas to use when given a certain subset of information is most important, and has basically that critical thinking is not really required of an engineer.

Really? How true is this?

Ideally I would like something to counter his position and give him something to think about regarding how he is choosing to learn the material, but then again I am not majoring in engineering, so I do not know how much the problem-solving applies to engineers; according to him, not much.

The idea behind this is that both basements would be finished off, possibly incorporating one of the rooms as a theater room/man cave/game room. 

**My thinking behind the Appeal of such a design:**

- Cool temperatures in summer
- ""wow"" factor of showing people that you have not one, but two basements down below your house.
- Sound muffling, so we can have loud parties/watch movies at excessive volume without disturbing the neighborhood/people sleeping upstairs on floor 2.


**My Thinking behind the possible difficulties of such a design:**

- Digging a hole twice as deep = Twice the cost?
- Ground Water table- if the basement is deeper than the water table, will we need a massive sump pump?
- Structural Integrity: I'm assuming we would need reinforced, double or triple thick concrete foundation for keeping the pressure of the dirt around the walls on the second basement floor from caving in. 
- Airflow: Will we need enhanced ventilation to not only heat the basements in the winter, but also get good airflow and oxygen down to the second basement level?
- Safety, as the only exits would be up...I'm assuming you would need an extensive fire detection and sprinkler system set up in case of a fire down there.

**Bonus Ideas:** 

- Having a secret door/bookshelf that leads down to the second basement. So people wouldn't know about the second basement if i didn't want them to.
- Possibly build the basements out wider than the house even is, enabling for the basements to be massive, far more square footage than the house itself, with possible alternate entrances or secret exits out to a work shed or something... tunnels, all guys like tunnels i think.

They are offering me 60k a year plus health insurance. I will have to deal directly with clients from all over the world, specially in Latin America. I will have to test and debug software from the company, and develop custom made projects for certain clients. I will have to travel a lot around the world, and I speak fluently 3 languages (Spanish, Portuguese and English). I have 3 years of experience, 2 working for the company. I'm an Electronics Engineer but I have been working with much success on software development and support since I graduated.

In my ""research"" I have found that the average salary for this kind of position in Chicago is between 70k and 90k a year. I think I should get more because of the fact that they want me to move out of my country and far from my family and the job involves dealing with clients and a lot of time traveling, plus languages.

Am I correct? What should I ask for? or should I be happy with the 60k? What kind of lifestyle can I have in Chicago with that salary?

They are putting a lot of pressure for me to give a quick answer (today or tomorrow!)

Thanks in advance for your help

EDIT: I'm a single, 27 years old male. If I move it will be just me, no wife or fiancée or kids involved.


EDIT2: Thanks for all the advice, as usual Reddit delivers with the help needed :D you guys are great.

The consensus is that 60k is too low, so I will ask for 85k hoping to get at least 75k, any less than that and I will not move.

They have been searching for someone to fill this position for 6 months now, but for some reason coulnt find anyone interested in America, so they started looking at other divisions of the company and found me, acording to them Im the ideal candidate because I already know the clients and the company producs and Im doing a pretty good job with our clients here.

I will have to comute to Lisle, but there is no way in hell I will leave my big fun city in Latin America to live in an US suburb, so it has to be Chicago.

The general idea of this project is to move items (wooden block, dice, dime, and a 2 dollar coin) from one side of the table to the other.

Simple concept, but a ridiculous amount of constraints are required that make this project seem impossible. Nobody from our lab knows what they're doing, and this project has **never** been done before - not by our professor, our TAs, or students from the past. We're basically the guinea pigs for this project, yet the professor is making this worth 25% of our grade.

The link for the project explanation/requirements is [here](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B3b3sZmmb6FGODRiODc4ZmQtMDYyNy00MjY4LWJiY2MtMjUwMTVkOTBhYzky) (you only need to read pages **2** and **3**)


-----------

TL; DR
If you're too lazy to read through the two pages or click the link, I will summarize some of the basic constraints here:

* The items start in a randomized order on top of a cup. 
* There is a barrier about 8 inches high near the middle of the table which cannot be touched. 
* The items must end on top of another cup which is on the other side of the table, but this time they must be on top of the cup in a specific order- wooden block on the bottom, then dice, then two dollar coin, then dime)
* The wooden block must touch both sides of the table before it ends on top of the cup.
* The dice only needs to touch the second half of the table, but must do so for 5 seconds before it ends on top of the ending cup.
* Entire system must be **wind powered**. We are allowed to use a wind turbine that we built from a previous project. I think battery powered systems may be allowed. But seeing as how our budget is $40, we're not expecting anything fancy. 
* No human intervention except at the very beginning. The human intervention is to essentially start the system. Once the system goes, no more human intervention is allowed.
* System  must complete objectives within 90 seconds. 25% grade reduction if system takes longer than 120 seconds.

My project team is designing a 3 axis linear robot (basically a CNC robot) and we have started selecting lead screws for the 3 axis. I've looked up various lead screw manufacturers but none of them tell you how the end of the lead screw looks like. If we need to mount it say to a bearing or a coupling we need a smooth part at the ends for that. Does anyone know how we can determine this? 

The other thing is that my two other team members are assuming that everything needs to be SUPER precise and accurate or else the lead screw will seize up or the rails will get locked or whatnot. We basically decided that we should be buying most of the critical stuff like rails or actuator assemblies and build as little as possible to reduce the amount of error. So one of our choices is to buy a whole $800 linear assembly for each axis ($2400) which is ridiculous because I doubt the school will pay for that. This would minimize our manufacturing work which I think is bad because it's fun to actually make stuff. 
The other option is to buy the rails and lead screw separately and sort of put them together which would come out to about $1000. This would make it less precise (according to my team) and more prone to error. 

I guess I should mention the application is for a pencil to draw a circle on paper and maybe have the ability to mount a dremel on there. So this is where I need some help. Do we really need $2400 worth of parts to make it run well or can we go with option 2 and make it work fairly easily? I've seen DIY cnc machines online and they work remarkably with minimal price.

Problem: Ventilators and CPAP/BiPap machines cost well into the thousands of dollars. There exist many at-risk patients who cannot afford this or do not have insurance that will cover it.

Method: In theory as far as I can tell a ventilator type device (pumping only air) consists of an air pump, a flow valve, and a pressure limiter as well as a flowmeter, and pressure meter. The critical functions of the device are controlling the valves and pressure limiter based on inputs from the meters as well as an internal timer.

Expected result: A circuit board design and supporting microcontroller software to run the unit which in theory could use any available set of valves, pumps, and meters provided all of the parts were there.

Why? It seems like in a critical situation one could probably build a ventilator for under $1000 before including batteries. Opening the standard would challenge pricing on the basic units. This in turn would free up more patient funds for other features (like buying more batteries) as well as expanding access to critical care devices by allowing for more variety of mechanical components to be used.

In work, I'm supposed to be predicting the fatigue life of a certain steel component (grade S 275 JR). The component is just a restrained plate, with a hole in it. There is a pin going through the hole which is pulled sideways causing a contact stress of 290MPa, the plate has already been checked for bearing strength, that's fine.

The plate will be loaded upto similar loads each time it is used, then unloaded 290MPa is expected to be the maximum stress in the piece near the point of contact.

I've trawled the internet for S-N curves for S275JR Steel, even the endurance limit for this steel, so I can't read off an S-N curve the number of cycles this material will take, nor can I use Goodmans method of estimating life 

Does anyone know of any sources of either of these material properties? I have access to some british standards and eurocodes I can reference, but all the standards I've checked so far don't have this data.

I've been shocked by wall current before, as well as a running engine, and it felt similar to wall current, although I don't think this metric is particularly valid.  My hand jumped against my chest, and the lawnmower sputtered and died. The safety handle is fastened securely with a clamp, so my grip had nothing to do with the lawnmower dying. 

 I then touched the fence with the back of my hand, touched the lawnmower, touched the lawnmower and fence at the same time, started the lawnmower, and touched both the fence and the lawnmower at the same time. None of these actions caused a shock. 

How did this happen? I'm not really worried about my safety, but as an engineering student, it bothers me that I cannot find a hypothesis to explain this event. I've made 4:

1. My neigbor weaves an extenton chord through the fence, to power her fountain. Perhaps the insulation has worn, electrifying the fence.  This seems unrasonable to me.  The fence is metal, on metal posts stuck into the ground, fastened togeather with metal bolts.  I think this is a ground, and the shortest path for the current to ground has nothing to do with me. I cannot see if the fountain is running or not. 

2. The ignition system of the lawnmower was involved. I dislike this hypotosis because the entire lawnmower acts as a ground for the magneto, it's all metal. [This](http://www.smallenginesrepairs.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/tecumseh-cdi.jpg) explains. I know this is  the type of system the mower has. If the  high voltage  was ""leaking"" it shouln't have gone through the handle, me, and the fence; it would take the shortest path to the engine block.   The lawnmower is an old snapper, carefully maintained,  similar to [this](http://auction.repocast.com/details.cfm?ID=825301#photos), with electric start. 
The battery is missing, and the ends of the battery cables are covered with electrical tape; but I don't' see how this is relevant; the're two  different circuits (the battery is charged by another coil, the same magnet, and a rectifier), and even if some bizarre wiring problem pumped high voltage through the starting system, the engine block is the ground, not the fence. 

3. Static electricity created a potential difference between the lawnmower and fence. Despite Engineering Physics 2; I really don't know if this is a practical explanation. There's a lot of moving parts, could something set up a vandegraff-like condition? I think the wet grass would keep the lawnmower pretty well grounded, but I could be wrong.

4. I am mistaken about getting shocked. I reject this because the lawnmower started dying exactly while I perceived the shock, suggesting this was a physical, and not a mental phenomenon.

Thanks for reading this far, anyway.  Any thoughts are appreciated. 

tl;dr  I touched my lawnmower and a fence at the same time, why did I get shocked?

The Wrangler is not without its faults, however.  It handles poorly, brakes slowly, accelerates slowly over 60mph, and gets poor fuel economy.  In an effort to combat the fuel economy issue, Chrysler recently installed the Pentastar V6 which is considered a fuel efficient engine.

What could be done to improve fuel efficiency while still allowing the Jeep to look like a Jeep and perform like a Jeep off road.  I understand the principles, you can either (1) make the vehicle more aerodynamic; (2) make the vehicle's drivetrain more efficient; and (3) summon the spirit of Colin Chapman and ""add lightness.""

I am 25 years old and considering going back to school to become an engineer. I currently work has a pharmacist and make ~140k gross income. I don't necessarily hate my job, but I find myself becoming very bored at times and don't see myself doing this for the rest of my life.

Growing up I was always fascinated by how things work. I would take anything apart and look at the insides. I have a great interest in cars, guns, and airplanes. I also like working out code and programming. I find streamlining various systems very rewarding. Math comes very natural to me, but the last math course I took was high school calculus.

I've been trying to find some sort of online engineering course that I can try on my time off that would get me on track.

So I ask you engineers, should I just suck it up and stick with being a pharmacist, or pursue what I think I would end up loving.

TL;DR
1. Pharmacist considering career change to Engineer.

Update:
First I would like to thank you all for the advice. Sorry for such a late reply. I think I will take the advice and pick up a hobby. I'll also look into those online classes and certification courses. Hopefully there is one that I can do at my own pace.

I ask because I don't want my life to revolve solely around my career. A healthy romantic relationship, along with time to just relax and enjoy life, is very important to me. If my career would require me to work a ridiculous amount of hours I don't think I could find a good balance between these.

I am a civil engineering (geotechnical focus) graduate student. Proficient at simple 2-D drawing in AutoCAD: I used it routinely as a staff engineer when I worked full-time before grad school. I routinely find myself needing to accomplish simple drawing and tasks that I resort to AutoCAD for, but I would love a better solution.

AutoCAD is bloated, expensive, and complex. It takes too long to load on my machine, and does too many things for me to take advantage of. What I'd love is a much simpler solution to gain proficiency in for my limited needs.

I know there are plenty of freeware/shareware/open-source alternatives out there, but hoped perhaps one of you could give me a recommendation. Below is a (incomplete, but representative) list of the types of tasks I use AutoCAD for. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

* Simple line drawing tools: lines, polylines, arcs, circles, extend, offset, cut, etc. Defining circles and arcs by various geometries (e.g. ""passes through this, tangent to that;"" ""3 points;"" ""1 point and center"" and so on.)

* simple fill tools: hashes and solid fills

* dimensioning tools.

* measurement tools: length, angle, polygon area, etc.

* a solid set of keyboard shortcuts is a must!

* exporting to vector graphics files would be very nice for including good-quality diagrams in PDF documents by e.g. LaTeX

* The ability to import a raster image in the background. I routinely scan maps and site plans and then draw over them. Useful for producing new engineering drawings and also measuring areas, distances etc. on scale drawings.

That's it! That's all I ever use AutoCAD for. Can anyone suggest a simpler program that has all of the above features and few others?

I am a 28 year old female and have decided to return to school to study environmental engineering. My main point of 'oh no!' is that I will have to continue working full time. My plan is to go to community college and then transfer to a larger school. 

I am not concerned with having to sacrifice social time. I am not, I repeat, not a social person. Not being able to hang out with friends, go out to dinner, etc is not something that would bother me. I did just buy a house with my beau, though, so I do have to continue working in order to not be homeless, haha. That is my main concern. I do not want to become a financial burden to my fella, but I want to succeed in my schooling. 

Did any of you guys/girls have a similar experience? How long did it take you to complete your degree, and did the workload seem unbearable? 

I studied art initially, but am not interested in selling myself as a profession; in that regard, I really just like making art, not selling it. I currently work for the state with a job that is purely clerical. 

Thanks a lot for your input (I already asked this on askreddit, but I would really like more input if you're willing to offer).

(alt; why low voltage lighting?),sniper1rfa,17,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1clqnj/lowest_wattage_of_a_mains_voltage_incandescent/,"I just repaired, and subsequently rewired, some low voltage lighting that's installed under my cabinets to light the countertop there, and it got me wondering what the point of low voltage lighting is.

The disadvantages were obvious while working on them:

1.  They require transformers which are pretty expensive, not super durable, and loud depending on type. Mine weren't working because the transformer had failed, and I bought a really cheap one to verify that was the case. The super cheap transformer did prove that the old one was bad, but it also made a really irritating whine because it was a cheap magnetic transformer. This was eventually replaced with two electronic ones (switchmode, I assume?) which were pretty expensive.

2. Voltage drop, holy shit!
So I should've realized this would happen, but it didn't really occur to me until I replaced the single transformer with two smaller ones. When I originally fixed the lights I noticed that they turned on in sequence, starting with the left one and moving to the right one in a span of maybe 200ms. Long enough to be very noticeable but short enough to miss if you weren't paying attention. I thought that was pretty weird but didn't really think much of it. 

Then I split the circuit to install the much quieter electronic transformers and two previously dim fixtures ended up *way* brighter than they had been. Made me realize that the low voltage was causing a huge voltage drop over about 30' of wire, and all the fixtures were daisy chained. The sequenced firing was because the first fixture was at a much higher voltage and so the filament heated up way faster. This makes sense, since the low voltage necessitates much higher current, and voltage drop / resistive heating is dependent on current. Low voltages will therefore be much more susceptible than higher voltages, as well as a lot less efficient.

I rewired to reduce the length of the circuit, and tapped each on in the middle, rather than at the end, and now the fixtures are much brighter and fire at the same time.

Anyway, long question short: Is there a minimum wattage that a bulb at mains voltage can be manufactured? Found some lighting design forums which sort of insinuate that low voltages are necessary for reduced brightness, but nothing that outright specifies it. 

If a low wattage bulb can be made, what's the point of low voltage lighting? It seems to me like it's pretty much just a less efficient and more complicated way of achieving exactly the same thing...

I figured I'd offer a bit of an open-ended question.  One thing I always struggle with the design of are interlocks, whether they are used to protect machinery or people.  A significant confound is that these systems are difficult to test well, as they are often designed to protect against improbable or even unanticipated events that can't be adequately modeled.  Obviously there is no substitute for thinking through and enumerating multiple failure scenarios, but I was wondering if anyone has any rules of thumb or interesting ideas they bring to the practice. 

I'm talking about all the family of design choices available, like:

* Mechanical, electrical, or software?
* Systems in series or in parallel
* etc, etc, etc.

Recently I had to design a cooling loop for a large induction heating coil.  I was struggling with all the possible failure modes (pump failure / coolant blocked; coolant empty; coolant leak; overtemperature...).  After putting it down for awhile, I was able to simplify the overall design by letting the coolant siphon through the coil, and running an on/off control to fill the top coolant reservoir.

Does anyone who's done this have stories or advice about your decision and journey to independence. [Side debate: am I crazy for not wanting to be part of company growth],going_it_alone,20,5,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/104vqt/im_an_engineer_currently_working_for_a_midsized/,"
I started working at my current employer right out of school 11 years ago; I had done several work placements in different sectors that lead me to consulting and specifically this firm. Back then it was a small office of 15 - a branch of a much larger firm with the head office in another city. I did a wide range of work from residential retaining walls, to industrial retrofits and upgrades, to shoring design for contractors at the local mall. Most of these were smaller projects from, say, $1500 to $50,000 in fees.

Since then, we have grown to 50 and I have shifted into a strictly commercial design role, managing a small team and working in a multi-discipline setting to put up some fairly large commercial/institutional/government buildings (our last building was around $20M in construction costs). 
What's the problem?

I'm not happy. I like the challenges of coordinating between disciplines and I especially like working with an architect on little design details. The things I like, though, are outweighed by the things I hate: compressed schedules, overtaxed team members (me especially), multiple projects spreading creativity thin. Most of all I loathe office politics. We have grown to the point where the company has decided we won't do residential or insurance work on any level, nor will we work for contractors unless we have a previous relationship with them – the jobs I loved doing.

I chose to work for this company specifically because it was small and did the wide range of work. My love for my work is slowly being eroded away by growth of the company.

So, I am thinking about going of on my own. First as a sole practitioner, without any staff, basically doing the types of small jobs that my current company won't do anymore, mostly working with contractors.

As far as the amount of work out there, from my understanding the market where I am is really hurting for engineers doing that kind of work. This comes from comments from many of the contractors I currently work with that there's not enough engineers out there to help them, smaller building/property owners calling us and getting rejected and then calling back a week later telling us they've tried everybody else and they're starting the second round of calls, comments from building officials in some of the smaller towns surrounding us that no one will service their area, etc. Also, I believe that I could end it well with my firm such that they would pass on work to me they won't do, possibly bringing me on under contract for over flow during high demand periods.

**This leads me to my actual questions:**

* can anyone shed some light on how they went about getting out on their own?
* how were you able to leave it with your former company?
* how can I quantify anecdotal market information (the last paragraph above)?
* better yet is there a way to predict revenue at all?

Bottom line: **can an engineer make a living working by himself**

Anyway, thanks for reading.

I'm an upper level PhD student in aerospace engineering working in computational fluid dynamics, with limited small industry experience in the same area. In this area, I write *a lot* of software, both large software packages for HPC and small scripts for automating tasks. I'll argue that strong software engineering skills is completely essential for this (albeit rather specific) field. But I'm admittedly myopic here, so I'm asking for a broader input from industry types.

There is a recent, strong trend in undergrad university education in the US to drastically reduce or even eliminate programming education requirements in engineering education (this is a trend and subject of debate at every major university I'm familiar with). This is particularly pronounced in aerospace, mechanical, and chemical engineering departments (possibly less pronounced in EE.) An example would be a department that previously required a two semester series of fortran and matlab with linux and changing this to just a few weeks education of matlab with no compiled languages. Another example is a requirement of a single course in Java, and a suggestion to use matlab without formal training or requirements. As a result of this, it's now commonplace to see incoming first-year graduate students that express an interest in doing numerical simulations that have never compiled a piece of software or seen a nix shell. For academic research, this is definitely a bad thing, and it takes a long time to get them up to speed. Otherwise-capable senior undergraduates ask to do research with our group, but their lack of ability in this area essentially eliminates the potential for them to contribute.


The arguments against teaching programming to freshman engineers I've heard from department chairs are:

* lack of demand for the skills from industry
* students don't like it (definitely the worst reason i've heard)
* difficulty teaching and expense maintaining the required computer resources.
* limited amount of coursework that can be taught in a 4-year curriculum, and time is better spent elsewhere.



tldr; industry people,

* what industry/occupation are you in?
* how well versed do you want/need fresh BS graduates to be in computer programming? 
* which language(s)? is it preferable to have someone with some experience in both a compiled and scripted language, or just one or the other?

Or perhaps assuming a typical value?

Also, does it make more sense to make calculations this way in general?  It seems to me that if you calculate the required power based on what's required to *maintain* the desired temperature given a known heat loss, I would think that would yield an underpowered system that would take a long time to actually drop the temperature from 100 F to 60 F.  This would be further magnified once you factor in the loss of performance that always occurs after a few years of ownership.

I wonder if it would be better to calculate the required power based on the time you think it should take to cool the house from, let's say, 100 F to 60 F.  If we say we want this process to take no more than 30-45 minutes, I would think that would leave you with a nicely powered system that can easily handle the expected performance drop over time.

My brother and I like to come up with impossible ideas, and then ridicule the other for how silly the idea is. I liked this one, probably not possible, but maybe... It is also possibly a really old idea but maybe this could be a novel variation.

Background:

* The closer you get to the sun, the more ""photons"" travel though each 1 m2 surface section (with normal towards the sun), mostly (?) because of the inverse square law.

* The idea of putting solar mirrors in space to reflect sunlight to solar power plants is  probably old, the benefit is dubious, it will have to pass through the atmosphere anyway.

The idea/variation:

* Given the inverse square law if you put a solar mirror close to the sun you may actually catch a lot of (how much?) sunlight. By converting the diverging light of the sun to a focused beam of parallel light (""giant lazer"") you may be able to transport it back to earth with little loss.

Relevant questions:

- How much light is lost from sun to earth due to divergence and how much is lost due to obstruction or other phenomena?

- How much energy can be acquired per surface area close to the sun? How much can known reflective materials take? Will it be possible to focus and manage a useful amount of light or will the materials brake down? 

Known objections and response(s):

* The solar wind will blow the sail/mirror away. -&gt; It should be possible to adjust position primarily by speed of orbit and secondarily by adjusting the size of the sail.

I'm a chemical engineer, handling the process design. I'm good with the piping, mechanics, P&amp;ID's etc. Here's what I need help with . . .

The project consists of 10 groundwater pumps over approximately 1,500 feet, that will pump water into a header. At the midpoint of the water well array, there will be two booster pumps operating in parallel to push the water up and over a hill.

What I need assistance on, is what equipment will be necessary to operate this system from a single control panel, with remote access. Each of the water pumps will have a dedicated VFD, as well as the booster pumps.

I was planning on using a PLC to control the VFDs for the booster pumps, which should ramp up/down based on the production from the wells. We also want to monitor depth of water and flowrate from the wells.

I'm assuming that 1,000 feet is a little long for standard wiring using a 4-20 mA signal, and we'd have to use fiber optics. What kind of equipment is needed for the transition from one to the other? Is this the preferred method for information transfer over this distance? Has anyone worked with wireless in this fashion?

I'm also assuming that we'd want a GUI in the field showing operating status of various pumps, but I'm also at a loss as to what equipment is needed for this, as well as the ability to remotely access and control the system. (I have previously worked with another system that used a cell card for access, but I was not involved in the design process).

I've only used PLCs for some simple tasks, and this project is a bit out of my comfort zone, so any information/advice anyone has for me, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!

A quick digression for those unfamiliar with brewing: for about 3 weeks while the beer is fermenting, yeast is consuming the sugars in the wort (the pre-beer liquid) and producing alcohol and CO2. The beer is contained in a carboy which is sealed with an [double bubble airlock](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_qZIOZF88W4A/TFjpmpl3YKI/AAAAAAAAAMo/zGRxBvMw848/s1600/brewery+update+-+17.jpg) that only lets gases escape from the carboy.

[BrewPi](http://brewpi.com/) allows you to measure the temperature (inside and out), but I think it would be interesting measure how much CO2 is being exhausted. This is can be proxied by the rate of the bubbling in the airlock, which is solved by [this guy](http://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/131).

Only single phase 120V power is available.,Joe_Pi,20,6,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/19df96/how_can_i_most_quickly_heat_a_150_gallon_tank_of/,"Be forewarned: I work for a theatre company, so there is no rational reason for any of this, other than artmaking.  The constraints are due to the performance space.  

I have a 150 gallon water tank approximately 2'x2'x6' that wants to be at 90 degrees Fahrenheit when we start a performance (it needs to be warm for the actor that gets in it).  We have to change the water often and when we do so, we are usually filling it with cold water and then heating the water in the tank.  We usually have to start this process the day before the show because the tank takes so long to heat up.  In my dream world, we could fill the tank and heat the water in under two hours.  Then we could do the set up on show day with existing crew rather than paying someone to do everything early.

**Constraints:** The venue only has 120 V single phase power available.  The building hot water supply is unreliable (and not controlled by us) so is either already out or only supplies up to 50 gallons max.  The tap water that we use to fill the tank can be as cold as 45 degrees Fahrenheit.  And we don't own the venue, so changes to infrastructure are out.

**Current Procedure:**  Currently we use a [1500 watt T-shaped immersion heater](http://www.mcmaster.com/#immersion-heaters/=lo1ukh).  Whenever we refill the tank, we drop the heater over the side, put the thermostat at 100 and then go out for beer and come back the next day.  In the summer, when the tap water is relatively warm, I've seen the tank reach 90degF in as little as 5 hours (with the thermostat cranked all the way to 250degF).

I've been researching all sorts of different heaters (immersion, in-line, tankless), but my brain has pretty much melted looking at all the options.  Am I relegated to just buying more of the same heater and using them all at once, or is there a more elegant solution out there?

M-Moment
F-reaction to create normal force
μ-static friction coeff.

r- variable radius

dA=(2*pi*r)dr 

dM=(2*pi*τ*r^(2))dr

τ=F*μ/(pi*r^2) % this is the step im really unsure about, whether i can define τ as just the friction force over the surface area of contact.

anyway, 
dM=(2*F*μ)dr

I was thinking about future fuel regulations today and thinking about how the industry will meet them.  To me it seems there are two ways to make today's style cars meet those regulations - through more efficient engines and hybrid drivetrains and by channeling Colin Chapman who said ""simplify and add lightness.""  

The IC engine has become dramatically more efficient in the past 20 years through better computers, direct injection, variable valve timing, new materials, better FI, etc., so it seems that gains there are going to be incremental.  Hybrid drive trains are certainly a big possibility, especially if a consumer friendly KERS system is developed or battery tech takes off.  Other advances such as electric power steering and low RR tires that actually hold the road can also help with efficiency.

**I'd like to focus this question on ""adding lightness.""**  I am a Lotus fan and that company, more than anyone, has traditionally focused on lightweight vehicles, most recently though the use of luminum ""tubs"" and chassis.  A nice video is here: [Lotus aluminum bonding](http://green.autoblog.com/2008/01/08/video-lotus-ferrari-tesla-are-using-lightweight-aluminum-in-t/)  In fact, Lotus Engineering has pioneered and licensed a lot of the tech involved ([link](http://www.aluminum.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=29336)).  

In terms of ""tubs"" and chassis components, aluminum is much lighter than steel, but also costs significantly more and is not very ""repairable,"" making seemingly minor wrecks a total loss.  Carbon fiber is certainly lighter, but costs much more and cannot be manufactured quickly.  Can anyone offer anymore on this topic?

In terms of body panels, it used to be that fiberglass was lighter than steel - is that still true?  How much weight is saved by the use of carbon fiber?  Is aluminum still lighter than steel?  Where does plastic fit into all of this?  Are there any other options for lightweight body panels?

Don't let me down /r/AskEngineers!

I'm interested in learning more about the physics/engineering behind [the Navy's RP FLIP Research vessel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP_FLIP). The way I understand it, when waves crash against this vessel, the sheer amount of weight below the surface kind of acts like an anchor that isn't moored, so instead of rocking back and forth, the ship just stays level. But does it bob up and down, or does the whole thing stay completely still?

More questions:

* How to calculate the types of forces involved, and how to determine the length/weight of ship based on how stable you need it to be? Would an even longer/heavier ship be more stable? Is the size based on technical specs, or cost effectiveness?

* What other types of ships used similar buoyancy techniques, if any?

* Could similar techniques be applied to something smaller, like a houseboat? 

* If I welded something like this (similar in scale) to the bottom of a houseboat, would it be more stable in storms and rough waves/weather?

* What calculations could i use to determine how long/heavy a much larger ship's submerged area would require to be just as stable? If a ship was twice as long, would the weight double too?

Also, I really wasn't able to find too much information about this at all, so if you have links to resources I can check out, that'd be great.

Once they get the first shot parts, they assemble everything together and do a simple function test.  If everything works, they'll go over the inspection report and change the tolerances on the drawing to let the parts pass, even when they've spent hours or days doing stackups a few months earlier.

I'm an ME graduate - I had three 6-month (full-time) coops while in school in different industries, so I have more experience than your average recent grad (working and interviewing), but vacation time was never really a discussion because it was along the lines of a need-to-request basis.

I want to know what you guys think of asking an employer if it's possible to get extra vaca in exchange for a salary reduction. (Alternatively, say if I just finished my first year, I asked for a vaca increase over a raise)

I'm from the work to live boat, as I hope an increasing number of us will be. But like I said I'm not lazy, and I'm aware of how carefully I would have to pitch something like this to avoid sounding so.

So employers, employees, what are your experiences with increased vacation? How would you feel if a rather competent and intelligent candidate pitched this to you?

Since I'm stubborn and really want to see the typical American ratio of work/vacation changed, I won't probably be dissuaded from trying this.

Anyways, once a program is written, and the machine is set up, is running parts really as simple as mounting the aluminum bar in the right spot, pressing a ""go"" button, and wait for the mill to cycle?

The suggestion was to contract people to do the cad, write the g-code, and mount the tooling/fixtures. Then one of us would ""run"" the appropriate program for whatever parts we need. With a tool changer, we could conceivably just load it up with the bits that we need and just leave them in there. Thus giving us the capacity to make everything ourselves, without having to pay someone else.

Having our own machine would really help in making new products, and we'd instantly be popular at the local hackerspace ;)

Inevitably someone comes up with the solution, ""Well let's just go with a higher strength bolt, then it won't fail,"" without delving into the actual failure mode.  It works for a while until they have another failure, then they increase the strength again until (like at my first company) they end up with a case-hardened M4 Steel bolt.

[This image](http://i.imgur.com/SBwMN1k.jpg) shows roughly what is happening.  We are threading into an aluminum block with a steel bolt, clamping a steel plate onto the aluminum block.  The threads are completely engaged into the aluminum block, but not threaded into the steel plate.  Their argument is that the aluminum is expanding and putting pressure onto the bolt head - enough to break it off.  That, or it is expanding/contracting enough to loosen the bolt.  This part is in room temperature environment, so we are not cycling between any extreme temperatures.  

I believe other things are at play, because the only expansion that would affect pressure on the bolt head is the steel plate (the member we are clamping) since the steel is threaded into the aluminum.   Since the bolt and plate are both steel, they should expand at the same rate.  The threaded connection would take on any stresses caused by thermal expansion/contraction - correct?  I cannot find any information online about the stresses WITHIN threaded connections due to thermal expansion - only stresses for clamped members.  Do you know of any references that detail this issue?

As for the bolt failures, I'm leaning more toward manufacturing defect, hydrogen embrittlement, possibly something else... but definitely not thermal expansion.

As a structural engineer, there are situations where a design load, which under a single application will not cause failure, may, under repetitive loading, cause a member/element/component to fail due to fatigue.  It seems obvious to me that this is also the case with non-civil/structural related engineering applications.  I'm just curious to hear from some of the Electrical, Computer, Mechanical, Aero, etc. engineers as to how fatigue failure or cyclical loading is considered in your field of engineering.  This can apply to any type of ""load"", be it an actual physical force, but also electricity, heat, rotations, cycles, etc.  

Specifically, I have the following questions:

1.  Generally, how many repetitions cause a given type of fatigue failure?

2.  How often do fatigue type failures dictate the design?  Structurally, fatigue failure most often is not considered simply because structures do not experience the repetitions/cycles necessary to result in failure.  Bridges are one of several exceptions to this, where vehicle traffic may need to be considered for repeated loading/unloading.   

3.  How is the design for fatigue controlled/governed to ensure the durability/performance of whatever you design?  For structures, fatigue is part of the building code, and required to be considered for any building or bridge.  Are there governing bodies that dictate how  much fatigue a given piece of electrical or mechanical equipment must be able to withstand before failure?

4.  What are your design considerations to balance the desire to minimize cost by providing less durable designs (increased profit), while also limiting your risk of product failure or poor performance if you provide less durable designs?

5.  Conversely, how do you decide that an increased cost to provide a more durable design is justified, even if a client or consumer is only worried about the bottom line cost?

Assuming one could make the flow arbitrarily large without flow subsiding, the calculation for hydropower would be (head)x(flow)x(gravity)x(efficiency)=(Power). Assuming about 60% efficiency, and a cost comparable to the Panama Canal (14.7 Billion USD in 2007 dollars), is it theoretically possible to generate enough power quickly enough to get any sort of reasonable payback period? (Not counting how you will move the power to the people it's supplied to?) 

I understand one would have to dig a much deeper canal than the Panama canal, since the locks are for raising/lowering over the landmass, not for the difference in oceanic elevation; feel free to adjust the cost to compensate.

Edit1: Added some spacing to avoid wall'o'text.

Edit2: Did some quick calcs with the info I gave myself...assuming the trench was far enough down to provide each ocean enough flow in and out at a central point (basically you ignore the width of Panama and assume your trench provides adequate flow...I'm sure questionable at best) so creating a hydroelectric dam with undefined flow rate and .2m of head - to generate 1 W of electricity, we get: (1W)/(.2m)(9.8 m/s^2 )(.6)=0.85 L/s of flow to generate 1 W of power.

So to generate 1 MW, we need 850,000 L/s of water.  To get close to a single coal plant's generation (500 MW), we need 425,000,000 Liters per Second of flow.  For reference, all of the oceans on earth contain 1.34 × 10^21 Liters of water.  But we only get to use the top 0.2 meters of the Pacific.  

So the Pacific Ocean has an area of 1.652 x 10^14 meters.  That multiplied by 0.2 meters = 3.304 x 10^16 Liters (converted).  That divided by our L/s calculation gives us 899 days of flow before we RUN OUT OF WATER (not to mention our head is dropping in that time).

2.465 years is not enough time to recoup at *least* 14.7 Billion dollars from the monetary generation of a single coal plant.  Case closed.  :)",,False,self,t5_2sebk,1362365873.0,,,True,t3_19kg8j,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/19kg8j/why_not_build_a_hydroelectric_plant_in_panama/,

It also said that there was a steel coated with the stuff had been immersed in salt water for 30 days without any effect.  

I guess my question is how abrasion is road wear on a car? Is this product's rating going to be high enough to last a whole winter?  Will it last even 100 miles?

Graduated with so-so grades in  December of '09. Couldn't find a job. Eventually got hired doing construction inspection. I've got about two years of experience doing this, and I think it easily falls under the QC umbrella. 

I enjoyed doing aerodynamics, and would like to shift to a career where that is a large portion of what I do. My question is how do I get there from here, and here's the options I can come up with:

1) Look for entry positions doing what I want, hopefully I'll eventually get one.    - I still do this every now and then, but it gets quite depressing to spend 30 minutes on an application and then hear nothing back (even a rejection letter would be nice). 


2) Go back to school and get my Masters. - This option is hard because I don't want more loans. School costs money, and undergrad loan takes about half my paycheck. 


3) Try to use the QC job in civil to get to a QC job in Aero and hope to move up into where I want to be.   - I've also tried this, but have heard nothing. I'm not entirely sure what jobs would be the best to apply or the best way to switch fields. Any advice?


4) Keep working/saving and try to start my own doing something. Wind turbines interest me, perhaps starting a company dealing with that would be profitable. I might also do this ""on paper"", having designs and give the appearance of work to get experience in the field.  -Thinking more and more of doing this just because it lets me do what I want, and I think the worst outcome would be that I end up with a failed company and work experience in the field. Hopefully that would translate into a job. 

Does anyone have suggestions on how to get there, or which path to take? 


Oh, and I also think I've lost a decent amount of my education due to not using it. I think I'd like to take a class or two just to force me to use it. I'm hesitant because my schedule varies wildly and I don't know if I'd be able to make the classes.

It seemed to me that after working out some (perhaps significant) engineering details you could equip such a UAV to perform almost anything a low-earth orbiting satellite could do at a fraction of the cost and with the added ability to maneuver anywhere, land for repair, maintain constant ground contact, and more. 

Even more interesting is the idea that such a UAV system could be segmented or in a formation so you could take just parts out of it at a time, leaving the total capability of the system unaffected.

My question is, who's doing it and are they hiring? If no one is, who wants to start up with me?

Any ideas how to make a better airsoft gun? ,frogminator,21,6,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/rhi59/do_any_of_you_guys_know_what_airsoft_is_any_ideas/,"Hey guys, I am home today with a bad back and can't do anything, so I got to thinking. If any off you guys know what airsoft is, you know that [more than] occasionally the guns break. I was wondering how you guys would build the best airsoft gun. 

* [Here](http://superdoo.net/airsoft1/aeganatomy.jpg) is a basic mock-up of the internals. This is what the electric guns look like internally. 

* [Here](http://aresairsoft.com/for%20web%20only/accessories/Gearbox/l85gearbox.jpg) is a more-detailed version, for those who don't know what a complete airsoft gearbox looks like. 

* And [finally](http://www.iedoutdoor.co.uk/Images/Corte_replica.jpg), this is the whole thing together. 

Common points of failure are:

* The seal between cylinder head and the cylinder leak. My idea was make the cylinder and cylinder head one part, so it is impossible to leak. 

* The piston head loses compression over time. My idea was to use metal rings like in car engines to minimize leakage. 

* The teeth on the sector gear (top-most gear that touches the piston) always break. I was thinking make all the gears wider, and out of better material. 

* The teeth on the piston, even when made out of metal, break. This is because the back tooth that the sector gear grabs is always under the most strain. No clue how to re-design that. 

The most-common guns, known as AEG's (automatic electric guns) use the gearbox that I have been referencing. They are light, portable and easy to keep going. Battery dies, and you just switch it out and your back in the game. New gas guns use a computer to control a solenoid, releasing HPA and propelling the BB forwards. This eliminates the gears, piston, etc. but now you need a remote tank and a line running into the gun, which easily gets caught on sticks and branches when playing in the woods. Using either electricity or gas, how would you improve it?


This is really just a fun project, probably never going to build it, but want to see what you guys think. Thanks guys, and prospective mechanical engineer here!

I have around a year of experience at 4 internships (3 in aerospace). 

I have a few options right now:

A) Graduate in May with my MechE Bachelors and go work where I interned, doing aerospace interiors (seats, lavs, etc.) Not really my area of interest at all but it is aerospace related, so maybe experience there would transfer?

B) Graduate in May and continue my job search with my experience as is, while living at home....really not hoping for this one. I've put in a ton of applications, gotten one interview which went well, but they only had one position, so I am in limbo, not rejected, but no positions to put me in. I had another interview that I am still waiting to hear from, all this from over 50 online applications.

C) Not graduate in May and spend the summer and fall finishing up the 24 or so credits for my Masters in engineering. Then find a job from there, hoping that the Masters + Bachelors + experience will push me higher up on the list for many of the jobs I am applying to.

All of this needs to be decided in the next two weeks or so. I would love to hear from anyone in the industry as to what they think might be the best course of action. One thing I kind of wrote off was applying outside of the industry, as I am very set on working in aerospace but if its a viable option to later then come back in I could look into that. All in all... having a tough time finding an aerospace job, and not sure which direction is best for my future.

NACA 6409 would be useable with low Angles of Attack (lift/drag~~23), but sources show a maximum of 38 at the highest AoA measured.
A flat plate might be working, but I couldn't find good measurements.

The wheels spin at a decent velocity, and are likely made of some kind of hard rubber or Polyurethane, you rub wool, fur, or even glass against the moving wheel and you might generate a good amount of charge.

**Program Status** - I obtained my ME BS in 2011 and immediately enrolled in a PhD program focused on structural dynamics.  However, to ensure I wouldn't leave empty-handed if I decided against the PhD, my advisor recommended I complete the MS/PhD sequentially.  I recently finished the coursework for my masters and plan to defend my thesis in December.  I am scheduled to take PhD Candidacy exams in December as well.

**Funding** - First year was funded via university PhD fellowship.  This past spring I wrote a proposal for a government-funded grant and was selected to receive the award.  I have guaranteed support for two years that begins next week, and it includes tuition, stipend, and a travel/expense budget.

**Background** - Although I'm an excellent student (GPA: BS 3.9, MS 4.0; GRE 760/650), these skills haven't translated well to the research for my masters thesis.  I'm completely solo since my advisor has no other full-time students, so my limited success has left me discouraged and without direction since I haven't managed to find a system that keeps me moving forward.  

Although I crave more structure, I doubt I would be happy on a mfg floor somewhere.  I am not one who pursued an engineering career because I had a knack for taking things apart and putting them back together, but rather for the love of math and science and the chance to apply them to real problems.  I prefer CAE over getting my hands dirty, though I do also enjoy running experiments in the lab for validation.  

To compound matters, I'm a ""non-traditional"" student.  This basically means I spent a good portion of my post-secondary youth exploring what the world had to offer and didn't get started on my BS until my late 20's.  As I'm now married and contemplating kids, it's critical that I make solid decisions regarding my career.

The bottom line - I think I may enjoy research as a career, and I don't want to disqualify it simply because I have a frustrating topic that has caused me to flounder.  I always assumed this required a PhD, though after a little research it seems that a masters may be just as good (if not better).  So without clear incentives, it's difficult to see the value in continuing the PhD, especially if it forces me to put other goals on hold.


___________________________________________________________


**Questions**

I realize there is only so much help to be found on the internet by way of posing generic questions.  However, any insight you can provide will be immensely appreciated.

* Is a career in research (industry, not academic) feasible without a PhD?  Will I be more limited in terms of compensation, advancement, general success, or will these largely depend on my intelligence and how hard I work regardless of whether I get a PhD?

* If I'm unsure which course I want to pursue, is it typically better to turn down a grant before it starts, or to back out of it later if I decide not to continue the PhD?

* For those researchers with a PhD, was it worth it?  Would you do it all over again?  If you didn't have your PhD in your 30's, would you still have chosen to get one?

* For those researchers without a PhD, how are you faring?  Have you experienced any drawbacks to only having a masters?  Have you had any experiences that made you thankful you didn't have a PhD?  Do you plan to get a PhD in the future?

* For those in product design, do you find that former researchers can make the transition to product design well?  Are their skills valuable in such a setting?  I've considered this as an alternate path, so I'm interested to hear whether I'll need to start from scratch or if my experience will at all helpful.

* Since I have guaranteed (though meager) funding for two years, I am hesitant to enter the workforce considering possible federal sequestration which may cut numerous federal contracts leading to mass layoffs in the future.  Any thoughts on how this should impact my decision?

***Initial question to /u/Weed_O_Whirler:***

* Could you design an iron man (exoskeleton kind of) realistically? What kind of knowledge goes into that and being an aerospace engineer what would you be able to do to help make it? Are any companies besides Ratheon working on it? It seems that you would have to be good with EE, Aerodynamics, jets, etc. Sorry for the weird questions, thanks!

***His Response:***

Well, I will of course be getting into speculation here, so don't take this as ""word of truth"" but I can give you some of my educated opinions on the matter.

My guess is, the Iron Man suit would have to come about as the convergence of several different technologies- some of which have implications way beyond such a suit. The number 1 limitation right now is power. The suit, as shown in the movie, would require so much power, and any way we have of producing such power would be so large, it is no longer a suit. Notice in the movie, it relies on an ""arc reactor."" For the power we're talking about here you'd either have to have mastered the mythical cold fusion or perhaps extremely high density batteries. Both of these technologies are being researched, although I'm not sure either of them are being thought about in an Iron Man way.

Secondly- an extremely hard shell is not actually great for protection. What hurts (and kills) a man is extreme acceleration. Putting a man in a very hard suit doesn't really protect him from such accelerations. Helmets always have a hard shell and then a soft interior. The hard shell is to protect the helmet, and let it keep its shape, the soft part is what protects your head. The research for this is being done by NASA. One of the hardest things about putting people into space (and moving them around up there) is that all the best fuels for doing cause too much acceleration, and would crush a person. Designing suits which reduce the g-forces on a person would allow us to use much higher-impulse fuels, which would greatly reduce the cost of space travel.

I'm sure there are many other things which would have to be worked out, like making a human form stable in flight. However, I'd say the biggest thing is powering the suit, and to really make it ""Iron Man-ish"" you're going to have to have a huge uptick in g-force protection.

Speaking from a ""philosophy of war"" perspective: the government really is moving towards a ""precision"" based weapons systems. There is no army which can stand up to the U.S in an all out war scenario (think WWII), but the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan showed we have a lack of ability to fight in close combat, no collateral damage warfare. Such a suit would be useful in such a scenario.

I'm not sure if I answered what exactly you were asking, but feel free to ask anything else specifically you have.



***Here are my questions regarding the previous context (Expand on anything you want including the initial question or what he said):***

* What would be the most realistic material for doing this then? 

* Would the person wearing this have to wear a special G force suit and then overlay it with the armor and maybe another overlay of protection (Kevlar maybe)? (In the movies, it is all together I think.) 

* It would obviously have to be cooled, would this be a problem? 

* After getting the power source would arming it be the easy part?

* What kind of research would it require to get the power source to be sort of jet pack size or like on the back of NASA suits?

* What UI would be the most realistic one and would that feasible?

TL;DR: Electricity Stock Market

Could improvements to the electrical grid including more advanced monitoring, routing, and networking allow for a free energy market to exist within the electrical grid?

Would it be possible for every solar panel, wind turbine, etc. to be manufactured with a universally recognizable identification that can be registered with the owner at purchase so that when it is installed in any physical location on the grid (even in isolated portions), it is recognized with a virtual address that can be accessed by the owner through a market interface (much like the more complex broker interfaces used to manage and exchange stocks and other market goods).

It's obviously more complicated than routing signals, but the transaction can still be made between two individuals with the system calculating the effect of the source on the grid and the expected result at the end and provide that information for sales agreements. I'm not sure whether it would be better to attempt to calculate the power drop across a distance, or work out an agreement where the primary utility power is reinforced in one area in exchange for selling an equivalent amount of primary utility power to another area.

The identification could include and route through third-party storage (e.g. a company collects power at peak production and disperses it at peak demand in order to maximize profits for the third-party, and provide the primary utility with more stable production expectations to reduce cycling of supplementary power capacity) and third-party collection/distribution (e.g. a company with available land in a high production location can provide a signal that meets transmission standards with a scalable inverter system that would be more cost effective than individual inverters, while offering solar capacity to investors at a more affordable price than personal installation).

The network could have systems in place for emergencies to automatically route power through safe lines to critical locations. I believe this was one of the original goals of smart grid ""self healing"", but it could be interfaced with the market to connect critical demand locations with individual sources.

One of the great barriers to individual ownership of power production is location and installation. You have to have the available land, the correct conditions, and either the direct access to utility lines at that location or the capacity for self-storage. If you have the available land then you have to pay the full cost of the installation (racking, routing, collection components, inversion components, home modification during installation, inspection, etc.). If systems can be utilized remotely (e.g. producing in a high demand area, and using the revenue to offset the price of power at home) than it could become much more viable to own sources of energy besides fossil fuels or large scale nuclear (I'm not knocking nuclear, but some people don't want it and would utilize alternative sources given the opportunity). Co-ops could be formed anywhere to build capacity in higher demand/production areas with the individual investors able to maintain economic pricing strategies for their portion of the capacity. Areas with high income, but low production of ""green"" energy would have more opportunities to purchase power production to meet their specific economic needs. People living in dorms, apartments, etc. can buy power production capacity that can scale down to fit their budget (e.g. you want to ""go green"" and offset some of your electricity bill, but lack either the space, available natural sunlight/wind/hydro, or capital for a full solar install, so you purchase 300 watts of capacity in a co-operative farm and begin offsetting the cost of the panels and some of your electric bill until you can afford more, eventually owning a remote capacity of ""green"" technology that is equivalent to or greater than your annual usage). This provides manufacturers of alternative energy equipment the ability to do more economic pricing/bundling/etc. than they could when limited to full system installs and customers in high energy production areas. People like me are a prime example of untapped markets. I'm an engineering student living in an apartment in an Appalachian area of Ohio that has neither reliable solar or wind (without government incentives), who doesn't make much, but could use the few hundred I scrape together for some bits of technology or software to buy a panel here and there as an investment instead, assuming I had some way to profit and recoup my investment in the panel over time.

The market system wouldn't necessarily require manual control over power purchase as it could be set to utilize the lowest cost per kilowatt-hour available. This could be disabled when the customer chooses to purchase power from a different supplier. This would appear on both supplier and customer's ends as a system very similar to level 2 market quotes (I wish I had more experience in trading, but unfortunately my experience is limited to buying shares of solar companies through td ameritrade, and I am not familiar with the interfaces of other brokers). Market quotes for bid and ask could be listed (along with a bit more technical information than stocks, such as calculated efficiency between source/demand) along with the owner/company registering the individual equipment supply (e.g. residential scale install) or collection/distribution center supply (e.g. investor capacity solar farms), and the specifics of the technology producing it (e.g. whether the residential scale install is solar, wind, etc., or what combination and percent of produced power is provided in a larger distribution service). This way consumers can make informed decisions about their utility purchases. If a consumer doesn't wish to pay the lower price of primary utility supply in favor of power that is ""green"" or is owned by someone they wish to support, then they can put a bid out for a specific source, or accept a specific ask. They could also use a range of filters to automate  their power purchases according to taste (e.g. purchase ""Solar"" at less than $0.40/KWHr; if none available in range purchase ""Wind"" at less than $0.30/KWHr; if non available in range purchase ""Green(any combination)"" at less than $.20/KWHr; if none available in range purchase ""Primary Utility ('XYZ Power' in your region)"" at market price).
Passing legislation for green energy would be less of an issue as consumers can vote directly with their funds in the sector of the market they demand instead of trusting the legislative branch to accurately gauge a perception of their demand.

Could anyone, from a single mother in an apartment building to a student in a dorm, own utility production capacity and maintain control over it's usage remotely?

Can utility ownership, at an individual level, be as viable as buying/renting a server or server capacity and hosting a website?

This is almost more of a life planning question, but I figure this is as good a place as any.

I'm graduating in about seven weeks with a BS in Materials Engineering. My grades are good (around 3.5), the school is fairly well-known, and I had an internship with a major semiconductor capital equipment company over the past summer. I had a pretty good time and decided I'd be happy to go back.

My emphasis over my Junior and Senior years has been overwhelmingly semiconductor materials: processing (litho/etch/dep), MEMS, packaging... I had anticipated I'd be headed for the the semiconductor industry when I eventually got out of (grad) school.

Due to a variety of factors (including personal interest and the advisement of my co-workers), I chose to apply directly to a handful of PhD programs. In so doing, I declined the guaranteed admit to the MS program at my own college. A director at the company where I did my internship implied that if the search for grad schools didn't work out for me, I'd be welcome to come back and work there.

I didn't get in anywhere, but the schools took *forever* to get back to me (about 4 months). So, shit, I think, I'd better try to get that implicit job offer on paper, because I'm graduating with a BS, and I need to have somewhere to go for a year or two while I figure stuff out.

By this point, the company I worked at is in the middle of a merger with another major semiconductor capital equipment company. They're in the middle of ""eliminating redundancies"" - translating to ""we're firing people now, so there's no job for you"".

So, now I'm graduating from school with just a BS in an engineering field most people don't recognize, searching frantically for a job in an industry that usually demands advanced degrees, with a long-term goal of actually getting one.

Any advice? Anyone been in a similar spot before?

So to give a quick rundown, I graduated in spring 2010 with a Mechanical Engineering bachelors. After that I worked for about a year in two different locations (a summer internship, then starting that fall a full-time employment at an unrelated company) in construction. The job I was working was in NYC and had some ups but more downs (particularly the owner/boss), so ultimately I gave my two weeks notice and left on very good terms.

I decided to take some time off since I never really took a break during college and started working a week after graduation. In that time I basically decided I want to get a masters and now is the best time to do it (no serious financial issues, no wife/kids to take care of).

My biggest problem is I don't know what I want to study. I wanted to work a bit after undergrad to try and narrow that search down and I did but only so much. I'm afraid of picking something that is too specific and then not wanting to work in that field forever. That leads me to a recent thought I've had which is to look into applying for an MBA program, as I think it might leave me with something more universal for whatever field I decide to get into.

Basically to summarize myself, I naturally seek leadership positions (president of fraterntiy, president of university student government, now on my national fraternity's eboard) but I also have a great passion for creating. Because of the latter, I've always said I wasn't interested in learning econ/business type stuff because I don't want to get stuck with a complete desk job. I ended up with one anyway in my construction engineering job so I have come to some realization that what is more important is work that is interesting. I still though view it in a sense that I want to feel directly responsible for the design of the company's output (whether it be a building, a manufactured product, etc)

So I guess I'm wondering what doors an MBA could lead me to and what it could not. Would going for an MBA along with my BS in Mechanical Engineering leave me with a diverse combination that I could pursue any number of fields with? Or would it set me up for a specific type of work? Are there other options I should consider?

Any advice / past experiences is appreciated, thank you!

I'm a mechanical engineer and I'm preparing to take my FE this October. I was curious if any EITs out there have any good recommendations for review materials.

I'm leaning towards buying this book:http://www.amazon.com/Engineer-Training-Reference-Michael-Lindeburg/dp/0912045566/

Anybody know of any better options?

**EDIT: Thanks for your input everyone. I purchased the NCEES reference and practice tests. I am fresh out of college and working for a company, and it turns out after some asking around, some people had some materials that I may poach for the exam. Once again though, thanks for all your reccommendations.**",,False,self,t5_2sebk,True,,,True,t3_jkg8q,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/jkg8q/fe_review_material/,
