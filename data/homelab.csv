I've seen people ask ""what should I setup?"" ""what should I do?"".

Do this.... should keep you busy for a couple of months. Any time you see ""backup"" assume it means restore from those backups too.... except your Domain Controller backups. No sense nuking the core of your lab.

Others please contribute for products I've skipped or basic items under products I didn't put.


Microsoft Home Lab Ideas


**Hyper-V**

Setup Multiple Networks

Configure Default VM and VHD stores

Add multiple hosts

Move guests between hosts

Backup Snapshots and Guests

Create Guest templates for faster install (properly as to not clone SIDs)


**Domain Controllers**

Setup first domain in forest

Setup another domain in a forest

Create a RODC (read only domain controller)

Create and manage sites in AD sites and services

Configure replication time between sites

Create first domain in a new second forest

Configure federation/trusts between forests

Backup AD database

Create a proper OU structure

Work with 3rd party password management tools

BONUS: Deploy Windows Rights Management features


**Threat Management Gateway**

Deploy TMG as your networks default gateway

Create network access rules

Create firewall policies

Create internet access rules

Apply policies/rules per user/group


**SQL**

Deploy SQL server

Configure Security Permissions (I create a SQL admins group and add users to that as needed)

Create Databases manually

Backup SQL

Perform DB maintenance


**Windows Update Server**

Deploy WSUS and configure what types of updates and products you want


**Windows Deployment Services**

Create a Windows 7 image to install via PXE boot

Add drivers

Add applications


**SharePoint Server**

Configure services to run with a managed services account

Create team sites, document libraries, search sites

Create externally facing (external to your lab network) sites

Perform backups

Work with security permissions to restrict access to sites/files

BONUS: Create internet facing sites (easy if you have a static IP, use some form of dynamic DNS service if you’re on a residential DHCP IP with ports blocked)


**File/Print Server**

Add a printer

Setup security of a file server

Backups

Setup file/folder usage reporting


**Exchange Server**

Configure mailbox databases

Setup DAG/DAC

Setup online archiving

Configure retention policies

Configure archiving

Work with NTBackup and 3rd party backup solutions

Create hub transport rules

Work with journaling and discovery

Create automatic signatures (hub transport rule or 3rd party tools)

Work with full access, send as, and send on behalf of permissions

Setup external contacts and mail-enabled groups with internal and external contacts

Create shared resources (conference room calendars, projector checkout mailbox, etc)

Add calendars to SharePoint


**Group Policy**

Setup password policy

Brand internet explorer

Push registry edits

Setup folder redirection and offline files

Deploy a printer

Install an application

Create startup, shut down, logon, and logoff scripts

**Final Steps**

Document EVERYTHING

**Other Hardware:** - Raspberry Pi (x3), several old crappy laptops.

It's almost entirely a Linux environment, specifically Xubunbu or Ubuntu Server.  I have a couple Windows VMs, but that's it.  I tried using Arch for the internet gateway, but it fell too far behind in patching to keep up.  I find it easiest to maintain when it's the same distro.

Some previous tinker projects:

* LTSP - G4 server + old crappy laptops
* PulseAudio RTP - setup multiple room audio with the PIs
* Nagios - setup the test environment here before I used it @ work
* Minecraft / Bukkit - used to run a public server, and had the plugin dev environment here",,False,self,t5_2ubz7,False,,,True,t3_196089,http://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/196089/my_home_network_and_home_lab_setup/,

Pics: [Excuse the mess :(](http://imgur.com/a/Qfgxp)

**STORAGE**

OS - Freebsd 9 x64

Memory - 32GB

CPU - i5-3330

2 x SAMSUNG 64GB SSDs (OS - mobo RAID 1)

4 x SAMSUNG 840 SSDs 500GB (RAIDZ1) - VMFS Datastore (4 LUNS)

10 x 3TB Samsung Drives (RAIDZ2) - Filestorage (8.3 TB Free)

2 x Sandisk 120GB SSDs (Filestorage L2ARC)

NICS 2x Onboard (LACP - Storage and Management) - 4x Intel PCI-e Card (istgt ISCSI MPIO)

**VM HOSTS**

All hosts have 3x NICs (2 via PCI-e card, one onboard). Two are used for MPIO (2 NICs on hosts connected to 4 physical on storage (VLANS)), and the last for management and VM traffic. DRS traffic occurs on a VLAN on an MPIO NIC. ESXi has to tag its VLAN traffic for this storage setup. I see 2Gbps saturation on each host while testing throughput on the individual hosts.

They also have crap HDDs, but it's ok since its only for ESXi (Seldom do I Storage vMotion VMs back to hosts.

Host 1:

Core i3 (2 Cores 4 Threads)
Memory: 16GB

Host 2:

Xeon X3440 (4 Cores 8 Threads)
Memory: 16GB

Host 3:

Xeon E3-1240 (4 Cores 8 Threads)
Memory: 32GB

**VM HOST MANAGEMENT**

My main desktop runs vCenter 5.1. I never even notice its running :).

OS: Server 2008 R2 Enterprise

CPU: i7-2600

Memory: 24GB

**VMs**

[Current count is 31VMs running.](http://i.imgur.com/h4A3wc2.png)

VAG* - Virtual Access Gateway (Server 2008 R2 + Unified Access Gatway Array) - Publish Exchange services and VPN access (SSTP). Still playing!

VAP* - Virtual Application Servers (Server 2012 and Server 2008 R2 - DirSync for EOP+Azure and AGPM)

VBS01 - Freebsd 9 running BIND (External DNS + AXFR to remote DNS servers)

VCB01 - Working on backing up our shit to the butt (Gonna take months). Running FreeBSD 9 + duplicity for encrypted backups. If anyone knows to how continue a transfer without restarting the whole backup, I would love to hear it.

VDB - Virtual DB servers 2 are Freebsd and one is Server 2012. Server 2012 is running the DB for SCCM, and the FBSD Server is for Zabbix and one is pending.

VDC - DCs are Active Directory DCs. 3 in server VLAN, and one in Clients VLAN. All are running Server 2012 Core + the two in Servers VLAN serve the DHCP Scopes (active/active cluster Woo!).

VSS and VDP - DP+WSUS+MP For SCCM and VSS is SCCM Site Server.

VEA - Exchange 2013 CAS Server array (In NLB, Is there a better way on the cheap? Haven't had any issues though.)

VED - Exchange 2013 Mailbox Database Server.

VMX -  Exchange 2010 Hub Transport Server (Comes in and goes out from EOP)

VMO - Zabbix monitoring server

VUL - Plex media servers - One for Movies and TV, one for Music. Both run Ubuntu.

VPC - Workstations - usually log into these when I'm out and about.

VWS - Freebsd 9 web servers - not really used ATM.

VFS - Federation server - used for SSO for Azure+Office 365.

**NETWORK**

ISP: Centurylink Business Class (Had to, I was on my 3rd strike!).

40Mbps/20Mbps

Modem VDSL2 (Nothing fancy, in transparent bridge)


External Router: Mikrotik 450G

Connection: PPPoE to ISP

Routing: BGP to Internal + BGP to Some VPN Sites (Not Azure). BGP Is set to default originate here (Default gatway for BGP sites that allow it, only me)

Firewall rules reside here. NAT and (a little) QoS is also done here (Currently have a /29 and I use all the usable IPs (5x) for various things).

Current VPN Setup:

Site to Site:

Each tunnel gets a /30 (Internal) transit lan for GRE. This traffic is encrypted by IPSec. This allows BGP traffic to pass and routes to be established. See [this (kind of) for more info or ask me](http://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;amp;t=67957).

I currently have a tunnel to a friend here in my state, and one to a family member in another who has similar interests.

I also have a standard IPSec tunnel to Azure for internal play.

Client VPN:

Currently using UAG portal for RDP gateway and SSTP VPN.

Internal Router: Mikrotik 450G

Routing: BGP

Connected to External Router by separate transit subnet.

VLANS: /24 for Servers, /24 for Clients, /24 for UAG DMZ External Range (FW Rules), /24 for Capture the Flag (In progress, could use suggestions - all remote sites have their own CTF subnet).

Switch: HP ProCurve J9450A (24 port managed GigE switch).

Other VLANS (Ports):

4 x Access VLANS for Each MPIO NIC on Storage server (not routed).

WiFi:

Nothing fancy. Mikrotik something or another that does N. In clients VLAN.

I was able to see what was going on because I always have [iftop](http://www.ex-parrot.com/pdw/iftop/) running on my desktop to watch traffic at all times, and my internet gateway is a Linux server.

At first I thought it was a seeded torrent going crazy or something because there was no single source of the traffic, my downstream was pegged at 53Mbps, and my internet connection basically became unusable.  I believe this was some sort of distributed attack because each IP address was using &lt;30k, and it was coming from all over North America.

So I ran ""iftop -P"" to see what port all this traffic was on, and it was UDP port 19 (CHARGEN).  That traffic was dropped at the gateway, but the sheer flood of traffic was enough to saturate my connection.

So I was trying to remember if I recently ticked off anyone on the internetz recently, and I could not think of anyone.  Then I hear of someone taunting a family member of mine...on Minecraft of all games!  They said something like ""it's time for you to go now"" and them boom, our traffic is pegged.  This happened a couple times.

So...the only way I can think of mitigating something like this is to block it further upstream before my pipe becomes a bottleneck.  I'm not sure how I would do that on a residential connection.  I also could just refresh my dynamic IP, but they found our IP address already, they can probably do it again.

It's also quite amusing that someone that spends all day on Minecraft has a botnet at their command.

Is there anything else I can do?

tl;dr - Got flooded with traffic on UDP port 19 by an angry Minecraft player, any way to mitigate this?",,False,self,t5_2ubz7,False,,,True,t3_1kluzo,http://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1kluzo/ddos_on_my_home_network/,

It took a few days to get them home but they are finally here. I also hustled a 3rd one. (buy 2; get one free!).

So without further ado, my home lab: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/rkm8Eik.jpg)

* Poweredge 2950 Xeon 2x 2-X5160, 6GB RAM, PERC5i, 6x146GB 10K SAS

And as a parting gift a few, a few spare HDs, Broadcom dual 1GB NIC, and a SAS6i card. The SAS6i I'll probably flash to an LSI ROM and get the SAS-SATA breakout cables.

I fired them up and found they all had ESXi 4.1 Standard installed. I didn't have the passwords for any of the servers except 1 so I used a Linux rescue USB key from [here](http://grml.org). So I have 3 fully equipped PE servers with ESX installed when I really want to test Xenserver. Since they won't be running continuously I'm looking at IPMI power on and PXE boot. I'm not sure if Xenserver can do PXE boot, even USB key boot is fine.

Right now I have an ESXi machine built around a 4u Rosewill. (RSV-L4000) I was thinking about adding something like these: 
[HOTSWAP CAGE](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817994076) but:    
A) I am worried they will fit. How do you determine which type of cage will work in what case??    
B) In the summer my ""office"" gets really warm, so I will likely be shutting my ESXi server down. I'd like to have this NAS in my living room (which is air conditioned) next to my router and HTPC.    
SO I was thinking about building a homebrew NAS since all the name brand ones appear to be upward from $700-1200. Was thinking about this case: [LIAN LI](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811112339)    
Questions I have regarding that are:    
A) What should I be doing for raid, if I should be doing raid at all? I hear raid 5 with anything 1TB+ is setting yourself up for failure, but I would like to cram the most storage I can into this case. 
B) Would it make any sense to just put in a few drives (2TB) non-raid for media (movies, music, photos) and then build a separate array out of some 10K drives for ESXi (RAID 1?)   
I am interested in what you guys put together for your NAS solution and would be happy to hear any recommendations given this situation.

These are wonderful tools for learning, but like all tools, not without limitations. Thankfully, these tools come at the right price, but in many ways you are missing out on the experience of actually doing the job. There are certain tasks that can't just be emulated.

What inspired this thread was a Cisco 1841 which absolutely refused to boot correctly. I was attempting an IOS upgrade and when I rebooted, the 1841 absolutely refused to boot correctly. It claimed the router wasn't correct for the image. It worked correctly in my other 1841s. So, I rolled back the image and it went farther into the boot process but it still hung before loading finished.

After some serious Google-fu, I managed to figure others who had had similar problems had corrupt cookies and had to edit the cookie via rommon ""priv"" command to resolve it. Indeed, the cookie on the bad 1841 was missing a number of sections (all ""f"" in hex) from it's cookie that the others had. So, after a few hours of researching, converting ASCII to hex, comparing good and bad cookies, and copying and pasting in Notepad, I had a new cookie. I inserted the new cookie, rebooted the recalcitrant router and the router loaded the new image just fine.

The moral of the story is that I learned about 3 things (rommon priv, priv pin, and the cookie) that I never would have known about without the having the physical hardware to practice on. Emulators have their place and advantages ($$$), but sometimes there is no substitute for physical hardware.

**It was incredibly easy and took 30 minutes if you have the stuff laying around! It's also pretty cheap.**

**[SETUP DIAGRAM](http://imgur.com/6qSMg5Q)**

My network lab isn't connected to my home network in any way as I make a ton of changes while practicing for my CCNA. I thought about connecting them to manage the stuff, but frequent changes of VLANs and IP addresses would have screwed me up.

###Here is what you need:

1. [USB&gt;Serial](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007T27H8/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) adapters for each device in your lab (or enough serial ports )
2. An old computer fast enough to run a Linux distribution. 

  **(I used Ubuntu Server 12.10...and that's how I'll write this tutorial for)**
3. Enough USB ports for all your devices.

  **(I used a Hub to make the setup as clean as possible. I'd recommend a powered hub if you have boat loads of devices)**

You can obviously do the wiring any way you want...like using console cables instead of the DB9/RJ45 adapters like I did. **[HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/19odee/cisco_rollover_cable_your_services_are_no_longer/)** is the post on how to to wire the adapters.

I used **[these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007T27H8/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)** USB/Serial Adapters since they were cheap and they worked without effort in Ubuntu 12.10.

###**Here are the steps I took:**

1. Hook it all up

2. Install Ubuntu Server 12.10 on the PC.

  **(I made my hostname AccessServer...I also selected to OpenSSH Server option when presented with tasksel)**

3. Install the software to make the magic happen (ser2net)

  Here are the terminal commands I used...**[this](http://cciedynamips.wordpress.com/category/6-installing-setting-up-ser2net/)** and **[this](http://mellowd.co.uk/ccie/?tag=ser2net)** will probably help you.

**Update your packages:**

    sudo apt-get update

**Install ser2net**

    sudo apt-get install ser2net

**Determine the names of your serial ports**
  
My built in ports were ttyS0 (serial) and ttyS1 (parallel).

My USB/Serial adapters were ttyUSB0, ttyUSB1...

    dmesg | grep tty

**Edit the config file in a text editor**

    sudo nano /etc/ser2net.conf

**Modify the end of the file**

This is what mine looked like...I used all USB adapters to make the physical wiring nice and clean

    2000:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB0:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    2001:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB1:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    2002:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB2:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    2003:telnet:0:/dev/ttyUSB3:9600 8DATABITS NONE 1STOPBIT banner
    ...

Press Ctrl+O to write the file, CTRL+X to exit nano

**Restart ser2net so the changes are there**

    sudo /etc/init.d/ser2net restart

**All Done! Now test via telnet from another computer on your LAN**

    telnet AccessServer [port]

Use the port number that lines up with the tty device you typed into the config file. I like to use SecureCRT and keep sessions open with all devices in tabs.

You could make a few changes to the setup if you want to access the server remotely, but I had not interest in doing so. I will only access the lab from the local network.

**I simply did this to remove wires from my apartment and make it so I only need to get up for topology changes. Changes to router/switch configurations no longer disconnect me. Think of it as a local out-of-band management**

It's primary purpose will be for me to practice and get experience to help me get the skills I need to become a sysadmin.  
  
I've been looking at hardware and I'm having a bit of trouble deciding what route to go. Basically I'm looking to build a datacenter in a box using esxi. Most ,if not all, of the hosts are going to be linux. I already have a file server so this machine doesn't need to have tons of storage. It seems to me that core count is what I'm really after. Price is a concern, I would like to keep it around or under $1000. Noise is also a huge concern, this baby has to be very quiet.
  
I considered the HP microservers but I'm concerned that they won't have the horsepower I'm looking for. I might move my freebsd fileserver to one of these down the road. The HP ML series is attractive. [This one](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16859107851) has a 4 core xeon with hyperthreading for $600. I would upgrade the ram to 32GB and with hard disks (haven't priced yet) I'm estimating the build would come in around $1000 - $1200. I have seen several people say that this server is very quiet. All in all, it appears to fit my requirements well. I am curious how the performance of the 4C/8T xeon would compare to an 8 core opteron.  
  
With that in mind, I've started trying to price out a whitebox build to compare. I'm having trouble deciding what kind of parts I want to use. I've been looking at the AMD 8 core cpus. The desktop models are ~$100 cheaper than the opterons. Similarly the desktop ram is about $80 cheaper (basing these prices on 32GB kits on newegg). This basically means to me that for an extra $180 I get ECC and I'm really not convinced that it is worth it for this. Looking at motherboards, I only found one desktop board with dual NICs built in. However it's easy to add NICs with expansion cards. The price difference for the two boards I was looking at is also around $100. If I decide to go the expansion card route, I can probably make that gap even wider.

With that done here's my [home lab](http://imgur.com/Xsotj03) *excuse the flash*

For the servers I have 2 IBM 326M servers, a Dell PE 2850 gen2 and a PE 2950 gen3. 

From the bottom to the top of the rack now:

* APC Smart-UPS x 750 with two battery packs.

* IBM 1: One single core AMD opteron 250 with 2GB's of ram and 2 10k 74.6GB SCSI drives in RAID 1. It runs pfsense 2.0.2 for my firewall/router.

* 2850: Two single core hyperthreaded xenon's at 3.2ghz. 6 147gb 10k SCSI drives, RAID5, runs debian 6 and does DNS, a reverse http proxy, streams music via DLNA.

* IMB 2: Runs FreeBSD 9. Mainly just a minecraft server and that's it. 10GB's of ram, a 147GB and 74GB SCSI drive. Also 2 dualcore AMD opterons I forget the model # though.

* 2950: Has two quad core xenon E5420. Four 15k 300GB SAS drives in RAID5 and 2 2TB SATA drives in RAID1. Runs Debian 6 with a xen hypervisor. Runs VM's for my PBX and a few for windows. This server is mainly just a fileserver and a seedbox for torrents.

Oh and those switches on top are just spares I've accumulated. One is a Cisco 2950 24 port and the other is a Linksys/Cisco SFE2000. My switch that's actually in use is in another room, it's a Force10 SA-01-GE-48T.

Today, I'm posting because I was able to do so and I wanted to share my success with anyone else who was wanting to do the same thing.

I created a virtual machine running Ubuntu Server 13.04 with Lubuntu desktop. Not required, but I removed all the added software that I do not use. This machine will do nothing but run CrashPlan, so everything else could go.

On my NAS I have my storage mounted to /srv/storage through mhddfs. All of my network shares are within this folder, so I was able to make a Samba share for /srv/storage and mount it on my backup server. From there, I am able to backup my entire NAS to both CrashPlan Cloud and to a local 1TB external (mounted on the file server and shared the same way) for a local backup and an offsite backup. Both backups are managed in CrashPlan and it works flawlessly.

I now have a dedicated server that handles my backups. This allows me to set me frequent time settings and dedicate for CPU resources to running the backup than it did when it was installed on my desktop. Eventually I would like to push alerts to [RapidPush](http://www.rapidpush.net) but that is another project all on it's own.

* FreeNAS - Srorage
* W2K8R2 - Domain, RADIUS, DNS, Windows Backup Management
* pfSense - Router, DHCP
* W7SP3 - Windows media center host (Not aware of any WMC server solutions)
* VPN server, so I can access all of my media from anywhere in the world, securely, and be able to stream everything to my college dorm ;D

I soon realized a lot of the stuff may be too much to handle for the N54L and if it is, I will probably built a white-box with the above parts, but more ram and much better processing power. (Xeon E3-1245 maybe?)

So to the part to where this server gets put in production, the FreeNAS will serve as my central storage location for various media files.
The Windows server will be used for domain authentication on all of the computers throughout the home, it will also be used for a RADIUS server for network authentication (seamless integration with the domain controller). All of the computers in the home will be backed up periodically to the windows server, which will be stored on the file server (FreeNAS), oh and not to forget the DNS server ;P
pfSense will server as my router, this will be in touch with the RADIUS server for network authentication. 
The Windows 7 install is to host Windows Media Center (WMC) because I will have all of our TV's running over the network. I planned on using a InfiniTV 6 Channel Ethernet Tuner and having it communicate via the WMC host to then sent all the recordings to the FreeNAS storage server, WMC will then be able to pull all the live channels from the InfinitiTV6 and the Recordings form the FreeNAS server.
All of the TV's would be connected with a WMC Extender which allows you to playback Live TV and all of the Recordings, not to mention all of the movies, pictures, and music that will be stored on the FreeNAS, all beamed to your TV ;D

I would like to hear what you guys would change on this configuration, any valuable feedback is welcome!
I will Update this post with further extensions I had planned for my Future Home Network.

I had this idea the other day, but as I am only a hobbyist sysadmin, I think I will need some help accomplishing this.  

My formal (and undergoing) education is in computer science, but I've loved server management/network programming for a long time.  

I have an Amazon EC2 VPS on which I run a few web projects. I also (used to) have two small home servers mainly used for web development and as a testing ground for web apps prior to uploading them to EC2.  

Anyway, as I currently have no home server to use as a web development environment, I wanted to set something up, but I wanted to do something more challenging for both the sake of the learning experience and the awesome setup that would result from it if I succeeded.  

The machine that I plan on using for this is not necessarily meant to be a server, but it fit on my college student budget and I think it will suffice for my requirements. Here are the specs for it:  
- 3.06GHz Intel Pentium E6600 (eh)  
- 4GB DDR3 RAM  
- 500GB SATA HDD with 32MB cache  
- 1TB SATA HDD with 64MB cache  

What I want to do is setup 3 VPSs on the above machine:  
- a file/backup server to take advantage of all that disk space, probably running CentOS  
- a web server/development environment, running Debian  
- a Minecraft server, not sure what Linux distro might be optimal for this though  

I'm not particularly worried about performance issues from running three VPSs on that machine as none of them are expected to get much traffic: the file server will be used only for periodical backup of my laptop over LAN; the web server will mostly only be accessed by me and my roommates, and possibly a few other people that I share its WAN address to; the Minecraft server will be mostly desolate and I don't expect to ever have more than 5 people on it at the same time.

Now, I've never done this before, so I'm not entirely sure where to start. I manage an Amazon VPS, but that won't help me much. I have some experience with virtualization in Windows using VMware and VirtualBox, but I don't think this will be quite the same thing. The host system will have no GUI (nor will any of the guest VPSs for that matter), and while I'm aware that there is a CLI implementation of VirtualBox, I don't know if that is the best solution for this performance-wise.  

I tried to do some research on this, but most results concerned VPS service providers, rather than regarding setting up your own VPS (so I'm guessing it's not very common or maybe I didn't google for the right thing). I was able to find one article that despite its age, I found really insightful on the subject: http://www.ultramonkey.org/papers/lvs_tutorial/html/  

I also stumbled upon KVM (http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) which seems like it might be the exact thing I'm looking for, but because there's seems to be so many solution for this (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_platform_virtual_machines), I don't know which one would best fit my requirements or is most feasible for my situation.  

I am looking for any advice/expertise/personal experience or even links to tutorials/articles/etc that might help me with this project.

My main question is: why is it that I haven't seen an ML310e in someone else's build? It's a good price, server hardware, HP supported, iLO Management. The other option I was looking at was [Chris Wahl's Whitebox Build](http://wahlnetwork.com/2012/03/13/building-esxi-5-whitebox-home-lab-servers/) with the exception of the storage arrangement. I like the idea of the Cherryville SSD to store the VMs on and the WD RE4s in a RAID 5 NAS.

Their solution is to write their own idmapping algorithm for samba and discard the standard one (even though they seem to work exactly the same but with fixed values). This makes it basically impossible to use the same shares for CIFS and NFS clients. I cannot change the idmapping on my Linux clients because the Synology generates IDs so high it breaks PAM on Linux systems.

So my idea is to create a VM on my ESX box and assign it a datastore on the Synology, that will hold home folders and some other misc storage, leaving the Synology to serve ESX media and maybe some areas that only needs to accessed by either CIFS or NFS.

I have a few spin disks drives already and the plan is to use those for now. I went with a HTPC case because I wanted something I could put on my desktop and set my monitor on. This was the only one I found that would take 5+ drives.

I know everyone says stay away from spin drives but they'll have to do for now. So I'll have a 250GB drive for the OS, and two 3TB SATA 6Gb/s drives in RAID0 to hold virtual disks. Once income tax is in I'll look at purchasing 4 512GB SSDs and throw those in RAID0 as well.

I go with RAID0 because I don't care if my lab is backed up. Part of the fun is setting it all up.

My lab is 100% Microsoft to include Hyper-V. I've got a few server 2012 Data Center licenses and with the unlimited activations for guests I can't ignore using it.

This will combine with my Dell E6420 laptop (8GB of RAM) that holds 4 domain controllers (2 separate forests) and my gaming PC (16GB of RAM four 1TB drives in RAID0 for VM storage only, games and OS are either on SSD or a separate spin drive) that holds all of my 2008/2010 Microsoft products. SQL 2008R2 clusters, Lync, SharePoint, Exchange, Forefront, SCCM, SCOM, etc. The new machine will hold all the 2012/2013 products.

I am currently expanding my storage space to add 24 3TB SATA drives and I'm looking at different RAID solutions. Some help would be greatly appriciated as I am fairly new to this.

Currently I have 8 3TB drives without RAID of any kind. They hold media and will have occasional writes, but usually mostly read.

I'm stuck between RAID 1, 5 or 10 or perhaps something else is better for me?

* I want to be able to survive a HD failing or even two.
* Write speed is not a big deal
* Read speed is more important, but I don't need extreme performance.
* I want to limit the system moving files back and forth as much as possible.
* I would prefer to have two pools of data, one at around 24TB and the other for what ever is left.
* I want to be able to expand the RAID by adding more drives.

Whats most important is protecting against HD failures as I currently have no protection at all.

After a very quiet few days, I ordered a couple and decided to dive in. Notable specs are:

* The servers come with caddys and rails (from most sellers). They take 4x 3.5"" SATA drives.
* Most come with dual quad-core processors, mine has dual Xeon L5420 processors.
* DDR2 ECC RAM, 6 slots (mine is populated with 12GB RAM)
* 1x PCI-E x16 slot for whatever you'd like, and a mezzanine slot for 10GBE cards.
* On-board IPMI (allows KVM through web console, including mounting CD/DVD or ISO)
* VERY quiet boot-up. The fans on max speed are still much more quiet than any Dell Poweredge or HP ProLiant server, quieter than a hair dryer on low setting at worst.

The server stays very quiet, and pretty cool under moderate load. Currently I successfully installed CentOS and Ubuntu Server via the BMC, and it worked like a charm. The only downside to it, however, is that OS X users will find the remote KVM unusable (Java issues I am trying to work through right now), but Windows and Linux work perfectly.

I look forward to any questions or ideas regarding these servers. I would like to raise some awareness of these nice servers being offered for sale, since they are quite a bit cheaper than the ""mainstream"" offerings (mine came with the above specs plus 4x 80GB drives for $220).

My problem is the box doesn't support hardware pass-through so I can't do a freeBSD (freeNAS or NAS4free) and pass the controller. As well my work place is Windows environment sitting on ESXi so I would like to lean more towards windows stuff (have DreamSpark account).    
  
I want to do a Raid5 for the NAS(WD Reds 2tb x 4) and use  the 250gb as the VM host.  I am not sure what is the best way of going about this. I was thinking of getting HP Smart Array P410 controller (100 buck on ebay) and doing hardware raid into ESXi 5.1 and then set-up one VM for the production side using that data pool but if I remember right anything over 2tb doesn't work for ESXi.   
  
 
Any input would be great. The production side of the name is the biggest part so if I have to get the HP P410 and just run windows 2012 or Just do a freeBSD option and use ZFS all without ESXi then that is what I will have to do.

I'm looking to setup a home lab and need to decide which Hypervisior to go with. Let me preface this a little by saying I am fairly familiar with VMware and have used 4.1 and 5.1, but I want to see what Xenserver has to offer. I will mostly be running personal things; Minecraft servers, owncloud, litecoin miner etc. and not so much business applications.

One of things I was curious about is Xenserver hardware pass through capabilities. The machine is already built, but it is currently functioning as a windows 7 machine doing litecoin mining. I would like to use it for running servers however unless I can pass through the video cards to a VM I won't be able to continue mining. I can't use VMware 5.1 either because the motherboard will not allow it to be installed so I am restricted to ESXi 4.1

Overall if there are any cool features/benefits to running free Xenserver 6.2 over free esxi 4.1 I would like to hear those as well even if it doesn't meet my requirements. (Side note: Does xenserver do any caching with SSDs?)

The other motherboard I was considering is the [Gigabyte GA-H77M-D3H](http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=19860) which is $26 cheaper but has one less SATA connector. I'm looking to run ESXi for the experience and I have heard rumblings of needing hardware support. Do I need to  consider this when choosing a motherboard?
  
The power supply is a bit high wattage but I wanted to get modular and this was the lowest rated I could find. Thinking something gold rated might be better as this things will probably run 24/7.  

Starting with 16gb of RAM and can upgrade later if required. I think there should be enough expansion slots on the motherboard if I want to add extra network cards at a later stage also.

Hyper V 2012 Server baremetal  
Proxmox  
ESXi 5.1 (currently using, but havent built any VMs yet)  
  

I'm tending to learn towards just saying screw it and going with Proxmox because I find Linux very interesting, there seems to be a lack of good linux sysadmins on the market and it is at least somewhat applicable at my current job as no one else in the department has any experience with it whatsoever.

Having said that, it's also very tempting to just say screw it and throw myself fully into Microsoft, install Hyper V server, getting a Server 2012 core going and learn to manage things from powershell.

How do you go about isolating your lab environment as a subnetwork that routes effectively through your basic netgear to the internet, and from hosts on the netgear to vm guests on the isolated network?

I tried m0n0wall and I was having a hell of a time getting the two subnets to communicate effectively.

I continually had the issue of the DHCP server on the netgear issuing IP's to the VM guests when they should be broadcasting a request to the m0n0wall subnet, and receiving a response from there. It was hit and miss.

Any preferred way of doing this? Any config examples, ESXi networking suggestions, VM appliances, etc.?

Ideally I want to have a dhcp server on both subnets. In the lab I want static lease IP's. In the lab, vm guests should never receive IP's from the netgear's dhcp. As for the regular network, netgear to laptops over wifi, I just want plain vanilla dhcp from a pool.

Edit:

Thanks for the replies. I have a few comments:

1. I won't be buying a managed switch for VLAN's. I'm going with the philosophy of utilizing my ESXi host to virtualize the solution, which is why I'm using a router OS vm guest.

Right now it's sitting in a data center until my contract is up in August.  I plan to have it shipped back to me so I can start up a homelab.  I plan to virtualize the machine using ESXi.

The specs of the machine are as follows:

* Xeon E3-1230v2
* Supermicro X9SCM-F-O
* 32GB DDR3 1600 ECC
* 500GB Western Digital RE4 (I disabled TLER after realizing it was pointless to use an RE drive by itself, so right now it might as well be a Black drive)

* Supermicro CSE-512F-350B Chassis (and a heatsink and rails)
* OS: Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard


I've secured an internship for this summer (paid), so I'd like to put some of that money towards lab equipment.

Since I won't have that machine until August, and I want to get started earlier, I'd like to pick up some other hardware to get myself started.

Here's what I've been thinking about:

* I want some sort of NAS solution to hold all of my VMs and any other data I'd like to share across my network (media maybe?).
* Gigabit managed switch (maybe utilize the SFP and do a little fiber networking?  I might be able to get my hands on some free transceivers)
* PFSense box (on something like a firebox x550e or similar)

Do you have any recommendations on what I should pick up to start up my lab?  I'm not entirely sure what I'll be doing at my internship, but I plan to use my lab to further my learning from the internship when I'm at home.  I know I'll be working more with infrastructure rather than programming, but that's about all I know.

As far as budget goes, I don't really have one.  I don't want to spend more than I have to, but I also want some decent hardware (e.g. if I had to choose between a gigabit switch and a 10/100 switch, I'd be willing to spend the extra cash if it's not an absurd amount).

I have installed ESXi 5.1.0 after signing up for the free version. That went fine from what I can tell. The on-board Realtek RTL8111E network adapter is working without me having to do anything extra. I also have another Realtek base PCI card installed because from what I read you should have two network cards in your system if you are using ESXi. The management interface shows both of the network cards so that is a plus!

I am very new to this. The farthest I have went in the past was installing Virtualbox and VMware on this hardware but under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. I want to try to use ESXi on the baremetal and then virtualize the Ubuntu install and XP Pro. 

Reading through the other posts on here I see that I should most likely get a couple of the Intel based network cards. Do you think I should go get those cards?

Since this is not a production system I am trying to save the expense of that since my cards are working at the moment. 

What I am wondering is how well will Ubuntu run underneath of ESXi compared to it just being the installed OS on this hardware? 

I also am wondering if ESXi/vSphere is where I should be or should I be working with some other hypervisor software?

I'm new here and I think this subreddit is awesome. I want to make my first (serious) homelab. I already have my raspberryPi as a homelab but the more I use it the more I find I want faster hardware.

I want my homelab to have the following software on it (minimally) and run smooth as silk.

* Sabnzbd (download handler)
* Sickbeard (database for tv shows on my nas)
* Couchpotato (database for movies on my nas)
* I want it to be a NAS (with about 8 drives) on a ZFS 'raid'
* I want to host a webpage (to learn the basics/very low traffic)
* newznab+ in localhost only (huge database)

Basically I want tons of storage available on LAN and SFTP. This will be my home media server that will send data to my PIs connected to some TVs and my PCs. Other softwares are for downloading the media and managing it.

The build I came up with this week is missing hard drives and case. I was thinking going rackmount with a Norco case if you think it is a good path.

Feel free to change any part you want I just want some help with this build.

Total:£692

I have a total budget of £1100 to spend on the server.

My plan is to install ESXI on a memory stick and use the Samsung SSD for primary VMs DNS, DHCP, DC etc. I will use the Seagate Momentus SSHHD for all other VMs. Finally I will have the Western Digital blue for backups. I am also considering a second Seagate Momentus SSHHD for data but in a larger capacity.

My question is is what I'm doing best for performance? Should I go for multiple smaller drives about 300GB drives and have 3 VMs per drive or a raid array or will one SSHHD perform? I'm trying to store all data off the OS disk so they don't need the space of raid but, if I do store data on the OS disk raid might be the way I go.

Would installing freenas on a memory stick and having a dedicated data disk shared over SMB for all the VMs work well or would it result in better performance storing the data on the VM OS disk? 

Very undecided on storage and how I'm going to do that.

I haven't chosen an Intel network card but would preferably like something with two gigabit NICs.

I have chosen the FX8320 over the FX8350 because I've been told its so easy to over clock it I can save some money. Will it really be that easy while running ESXI or should I just buy the faster CPU?

The reason I have chosen an expensive motherboard is I plan to use this computer for other things as well as my lab. I'm also considering a Corsair H110 with push pull. I'd like some more powerful, louder fans though not sure what to go with.

Just ordered an ex display Bitfenix Ghost for £50 for the case.

I'm still pretty undecided on storage. I think I'm gonna use SSD for all VM OS storage. Should I get two 128GB SSDs or one 256GB SSD? Its better value for money to get the 256GB but whats better for performance?

Would having one mechanical disk dedicated for data shared via SMB by Freenas give me good enough performance, or should I pay for more SSD space? Things like WSUS, website files and SCCM shared data.

Once I backup the SQL and vCenter VMs I'll be able to finally dive into it and start studying the good stuff for the VCP test. Couple questions..

1. What's the quickest way I can backup the SQL and vCenter VMs? Should I just copy the VM folders? Should I export as an OVF/OVA? Eventually I'd like to setup a backup solution like VEEAM but it looks like it'll take some time and planning, and require vCenter which I don't even want to add my hosts to until I have it backed up.

The VM folders are currently on an NFS share on a Synology NAS. I can browse to the share with NFS or SMB. Could I browse to it using Windows/OS X using SMB and make a copy of it to another location? This is my first time using NFS so I'm just cautious of using another protocol to browse to it, manipulate the files, and cause an issue for NFS/VMware to read it.

If I export it as an OVF, what exactly does it do? If I have to use the OVF to restore the VM, does it act any different than the original VM folder? I'd rather not export as an OVF if it will change the way it's handled if it has to be restored.

2. How do you have your physical NICs setup in vSphere/vCenter? I've been trying to setup my lab as close to the real world as possible. Been reading about VMware networking a lot lately and I've come to the basic conclusion that 3 vSwitches with 2 NIC teams is best practice. Each switch/team would be: Management &amp; vMotion; Storage; VM Networks.

I'm not sure if I'm going to turn on HA or FT in my environment but if I do I might take 1 NIC from the Storage team for it.

When you're using NIC teaming I know you can setup how each one is used, like for fault tolerance if one goes down or round robin to get that extra bandwidth when needed. I plan on setting it up for extra bandwidth but is that the best way to do it? Is round robin the only way to go there or is there a better way?

Is there a best practice when it comes to choosing which NICs to team together? Do you just team 0 and 1, 2 and 3, etc? Or is there more to it? My hosts have 2 onboard NICs (though they are two different chipsets) and I added a card with 4 NICs. Not sure if I should just team to two onboard together or mix it up with one onboard and one on the card.

First up, the plan is to run ESX, so I can have a wide variety of systems in place. I want to run some reliable services for home, and some dev servers as well. To explain a few of my choices:

I am looking to get this case:

http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=20111

- CPU I went with this for cheap, but 6 cores/threads, for running plenty of VMs.
- Memory, cheaper option, can be expanded to 32GB when/if needed or wanted.
- Storage, the 1TB will hold all the VM partitions (is this ok to do, should I be investing in an SSD for this? I don't really need fast startup), and also be a private network store for myself. The 3 TB will be NAS running freeNAS, I want this to be expandable, always appear as one large drive and perhaps be converted into a RAID5 drive later on (not sure how that works, but it'll be fun to work out later).
- GPU, I want to try and get a Home Theatre Virtual Machine running with DirectLink (do I need special hardware?), I already have this GPU, it's a low power, fanless card.
- PSU, this was the only one I could find with a fairly low wattage, high rating and had a fan (since I want some decent airflow coming from my machine).

The VM's I want to run:

- freeNAS, 2GB partition on the 1TB, using up the 3TB Reds (this is fine yeh, I don't REALLY need to stick a USB stick in since I'll be using a different drive?).
- WIN2K8R2 Domain Controller + DHCP + DNS (fine putting all 3 of these on one server?
- WIN2K8R2 File server, for doling out private and public shares.
- WIN2K8R2 App server, running Torrent/Download services and Mail Services + anything else.
- Windows 7 Pro client (for testing domain stuff, since I only have home premium).
- Ubuntu or Win machine running XBMC for Home Theatre Goodness.
- Ubuntu Server and/or Client (for mucking about).

Any advice on hardware would be greatly appreciated. Would also love to hear anything about the VM's I should be running. I'm doing this both for home network and for learning! 

I'd also love some advice about the Domain stuff, since only 1 out of our 5 machines are pro versions, and thus couldn't connect to the domain, how should I deal with the network storage permissions for those machines without the ability to log into the domain (local accounts on the file server for privelages?).

I have heard a lot that it's impossible to get a HTPC to run on ESXi 5.1, will I miss many of the new CPU features in ESXi 5.1 if I just use 5.0? I don't care about the security upgrades and whatnot.

My research has led me to one question: SAS or SATA drives for the primary storage which will be using ZFS?

I think I'm aware of most of the benefits of SAS over SATA:

* potentially higher performance from higher quailty

* potentially higher reliability from higher quality

* *fewer bit errors*

I use the word *potentially* because I've read some things recently that sometimes the SAS drives are the same components as the SATA variation with a different logic board making them not really better than SATA drives in some respects.

My planned ZFS setup is for 2-disk mirrors striped together.

&gt;zpool create mirror disk1 disk2 mirror disk3 disk4

Given the built-in error correction of ZFS, is the added expense of SAS drives really necessary?

If it matters, I plan to buy a SuperMicro LGA 2011 motherboard and have been eyeing the [SuperMicro X9DA7](http://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/xeon/c600/x9da7.cfm) which has an integrated LSI SAS controller.

I currently have an HP N40L microserver which just runs Ubuntu server and acts as my only home-server - tasks it performs are SMB shares, music streamer, ownCloud, web-server, SSH etc. and on top of this it's got an HD graphics card in it so I can use it to play my media back to my TV via XBMC.

I've decided to move the box into my office and get a new XBMC client for the TV. This is going to free the server up for it's original use as **just** a server, not an *everything* box.

A few months ago I built a NAS based on an N40L for my mate where I just used FreeNAS on a USB pendrive. I'm thinking of going this way myself as I like ZFS. However I'd actually like to run FreeNAS as a VM under ESXi. This would then allow me to spin up new VMs when I wanted to play with new tech, something I currently can't do as I don't have any hardware other than this one little server.

So on to my question... I believe ESXi runs off a USB drive (just as FreeNAS does in the system I built my friend). If this is the case, where can I store the VM 'images' (sorry, never used ESXi before so don't know the terms but I mean the file that is the VM config/data when written to disc) on my N40L? On the FreeNAS box I built I used all 5 physical drives in a ZFS array. Presumably now I would have to use one of those discs to store my VM images meaning that if I virtualise FreeNAS I can only have 4 of them in my ZFS array. Is this correct? Or can the VM image be held on the USB drive where ESXi resides? I would think that this would be a no-no?

**Is there any other way I could keep all 5 drives usable in my FreeNAS VM under ESXi?**

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone knows if it is even possible, and maybe some leads on how to set up such a lab on a mobile platform. Right now, I'm hoping my MacBook pro running VMware fusion 5 will work. The specs should be fine - it has a solid i7 processor, 16GB of ram, a solid state boot drive and a secondary 750GB drive, so plenty of space.

I also know that Fusion 5 has finally included a bit of a network editor now. Not as good as Workstation 9, but you know, work with what you have. 

I don't need anything terribly complex, but just enough to test the different server roles and different operating systems, all networked together on a host-only lan. 

I think [this](http://boerlowie.wordpress.com/2011/11/30/building-the-ultimate-vsphere-lab-part-1-the-story/) is the best lead I've found so far, but there are a few things I was wondering.

* The above blog seems to be a set up more dedicated towards a set up to test vmware (for, say, the VCP certification, which I am interested in, just not now). Is this true?
* What does ESXi do here? The best I can tell is that you can use ESXi as a nested vm to further load an operating system to play in this environment. 
* Finally, how do I simplify this for my needs?

Background:  
A year or two ago I built a new PC when it was time to upgrade.  At the time I meant to start abusing virtual machines more to sandbox some things off, but didn't end up executing it in a terribly usable way and it fell by the wayside.  Since I needed to install a new hard drive I figured I'd reinstall my system and try to do it more correctly this time.  
  
I don't game on my PC aside from the occasional flash game or Dwarf Fortress.  About the only resource intensive stuff I regularily do is media encoding/transcode/serving.   Otherwise, it's generally just used for web browsing, some code development, and normal day to day stuff.  
  
Intended plan:    
My current (possibly grossly flawed) thoughts are to install a hyper-visor hosting:    
1. a file server managing the bulk of the hard drive space available in some manner    
2. a general use OS for the normal day to day home pc activities (probably Win 7 Home, but not sure)    
3. a linux guest for code development and general linux hacking    
4. Possibly other VM's for toying with, but normally off.  
  
I'd expect normal use would be just VM's 1 and 2.     
  
Software needs/desires:    
Media ripping and serving is the only thing that I think I need to call out as the serving side might require some thought on my end on how to do best (which VM to put it on and set up and such).   Anything else resource intensive can generally run for as long as it would need to.  
  
Question 1: Hardware    
To get the hardware specs out of the way:    
CPU: AMD Phenom II X6 Black  
Mem: 8GB  
HDD: 120GB SSD for system, 4TB+ for storage over 3 drives  
Mb: Gigabyte 890GPA-UD3H  
  
Currently, I don't believe I ever go above using more than 4GB of RAM at a time, so I'm assuming I don't need to be upgrading anything, but I wanted to double check.  
  
Question 2: Host software  
What virtualization software should I be looking into?  I'm assuming the free offerings out there will suit me fine as I'm not running SQL servers or 20 machines or anything.   Poking around the web, the information seems to be aimed for heavier server use than what I am looking for so it is tricky digging through it all.  
  
I'm using KVM at work for virtualization tasks (a build server and test sandboxes), but I haven't played with it too much.  I know Redhat is throwing their weight behind it and I believe I've heard that it's a bit better than Xen these days.  
  
I use Virtualbox at home when I want to set up a VM for whatever reason.  
  
Microsoft's offerings are probably right out.  I don't get the feeling it will play well with linux.  
  
I'm not sure VMWare is better than anything else for what I need, and their install process irritates me lately (mostly just the register for a serial number shit)  
  
Question 3: Guest Setup  
Any suggestions on setting up the guests?  I am not a fan of volume sets or JBOD or similar so I was not planning on spanning anything across the physical drives.   I was thinking of a virtual drive for the guest's system install with another for a data drive (per VM as needed).  I figure that lets me reinstall the guest if I need to without losing data/programs which means i can tinker more with less risk.  Also, I can add and remove storage more easily as hard drives fail or others are added to the machine.  Is this flawed thinking though?  

On the topic of flawed thinking, since I am used to a full host OS running virtual box or kvm, I'm thinking that I should still be able to have whatever machine I'm working on effectively take over the monitor full screen.  Am I mistaken in thinking I'll be able to do this or would I have to have a more substantial host install than I might be realizing?
  
Also, what would be the best drive format to use?  I know Virtual Box and KVM both support qcow, which would be useful if I wanted to try a different host set up, but are their advantages to using a format that might have to be recoded for a different hypervisor?  
  
Question 4: File Server  
I'm assuming FreeNAS is a good one to start reading up on, but if there are recommendations, please share.  

Question 5: Further research  
Any recommendations on places I should look for more info?  Like I said, it seems that much of the info on this kind of thing is more towards servers and bigger iron, so I may be missing the relevant information, or my searches might just be flawed.

And if you made it this far, thanks for reading at least.  If you have any advice, thank you again. 

EDIT II:  
It seems that I do not have a motherboard that supports IOMMU... this might be a issue with ripping and burning media.

I have 2 (maybe 3) PowerEdge 1950's available to build my home lab.
I'm also thinking about getting a small rack so they are not just sitting on my desk.

However, I have no separate room for the moment where I could put them and they are quite noisy. Also since it is a big upgrade from my current vm's i'm a little worried about the electricity consumption.

Server specs:

* 4x 600GB 2.5"" 10k SAS disk
* 6x Gigabit NIC (2 onboard and 2x dual intel NIC)
* 2x 670W powersupply

I looked into the Linux Virtual Server project but it doesn't seem to still be active, at any rate they are talking about the 2.4 kernel as thought it is something new. Next I looked at load balancing but this seems to be aimed at http rather than serving files. High availability clusters seem to be more along the lines of what I want but it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

The server I currently have (and intend to build a direct replica) is running Ubuntu Server 12.04 serving an samba share to the local network only.

The motivation for this is partly as a backup but also to hopefully increase the speed of my file server.

I'm building two Proxmox whitebox servers using Supermicro hardware. For the time being I'm limited to local storage. For this I'm looking at a 4 drive RAID 10 with SATA drives. The motherboards have the ICH10R controller, but I appreciate that Proxmox doesn't support fakeRAID, no will it support software RAID.

1365734356.0,7,self.homelab,1c6jh5,Thinking about expanding my current setup,jairuncaloth,11,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1c6jh5/thinking_about_expanding_my_current_setup/,"Hi guys, I found this subreddit last night, and spent some time going through the first few pages. The idea of setting up a home lab is highly appealing to me, but I am in a fairly limiting situation at the moment. I would love to hear what everyone thinks. My current setup isn't particularly impressive, but I wasn't really going for a lab at the time. Currently I'm a data center tech, and I'm hoping to move towards a more system admin kind of role in the future so I would really like to get some practice in with designing networks and administrative stuff such as running services in a situation with more then just a few hosts.
  
I live in an apartment so I'm pretty limited on space. Noise is a huge concern since all of my gear is localized to one room which is basically our living room. Setting up a rack of servers is probably not feasible and stringing Cat5 down the hall is not likely to go well with the lady of the house, so I'm pretty much limited to the current space.

I am most comfortable with Linux as far as day to day use goes. However, it is one of the areas I really want to focus on getting more experience administrating, especially while maintaining a 'large' number of servers. I'm thinking I would probably want to set up one or two machines as ESX servers and from there I can just run a bunch of virtual machines. In the virtual machines I could run whatever services I need, and spinning up a new server when I want to add a service would be relatively easy and good practice. I'm not really sure how many hosts a single ESX server can realistically provide. I imagine memory and disk I/O will be limiting factors but I really have no concept of how many servers I can support with X GB of RAM and Y TB of disk space. I also don't really know what sort of hard disk configuration would make an ideal setup for something like this. Information on what I can reasonably expect to host on a single machine as well as ideas for disk configurations would be highly useful.  
  
Current setup  
Desktop / Gaming Rig:  
 - OS: Xubuntu 13.04 / Win 7 Pro 64  
 - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz  
 - 16GB DDR3 1600
 - 120GB SSD OS disk  
 - 2TB SATA HDD for storage

File/playground server (aka old desktop)  
 - OS: FreeBSD 9   
 - Intel Core2 Duo CPU E6550  @ 2.33GHz  
 - 4 GB DDR2 SDRAM  
 - 4x 2TB 7200RPM SATA HDDs configured in raidz  
 - Some random 100G SATA disk for OS

TV Computer / Media consumption (Foxconn mini-itx barebones box):  
 - OS: XBMCbuntu  
 - Dual Core Atom (Older, not booting it up to figure out the model)  
 - 2GB RAM  
 - 64GB SSD OS disk  
  
Network:  
Linksys 610N router with DD-WRT  
Cisco 2900XL 24 port 10/100 switch (currently not in service)  
  
Things I want to practice and play with:  
- Setting up and designing networks in a many host type of environment (vlans, lacp/bonding, etc)  
- Firewall setup and admin  
- Virtualization software - I'm thinking ESX is the likely choice here  
- OS admin in a many host / mixed OS environment (user accounts, updates, other sysadminy stuff)  
- Services - Mail, DNS, network services, PXE, anything else I might decide to play with  
- Database servers  
- SAN (I'm super new to SAN so I don't even know what is really possible at home) 
  
I don't really think the file server would make a good server for the kind of stuff I have in mind, and upgrading it is probably not the best use of my money. DDR2 is kind of expensive and I think the board maxes out at 8GB. My desktop isn't really a good target either as I consider it my user machine and I don't want to worry about bringing down services when I want to reboot into windows to play a game or if I decide I want to re install my OS for whatever reason. The HP mini servers are attractive, but I'm curious to see what other people are using for similar scenarios.  
  
My linksys router's 4 ports are all filled up, so I will need to upgrade my network in order to accommodate even one more machine. I could really use some gear recommendations for this. Quiet is essential, cheap is good, and a high level of functionality is desired. I'm not sure how much of the network functionality I can put on a virtualized server, but the more the better. Overall getting the network figured out is probably the area I need the most help with.

I have a PowerEdge 2950 with 2x dual core Xeons, 32 GB of RAM, and 73 GB 15K SAS drive on a PERC5. It's running ESXi 5.1 free. I've been hosting a couple Linux VM's and a couple of XP VM's. It's running fine, and I've been pretty happy with it.

I would now like to setup a Sharepoint site (like Foundation 2013 on Server 2012) that will be used by me, my wife, and perhaps a dozen friends. I figure that I want at least an extra 100 GB or so of storage.

So, I don't need a ton of extra storage. Performance doesn't need to be blazing fast-- just acceptable. What's important for me is having good uptime/reliability/MTBF for the storage, ease of administration, and ease of recovery if/when something goes wrong. 

I'm a ""frugal"" bastard, and I'd also like to do this as cheaply as possible.

As far as resources that I already have (and don't have), it is as follows: 

- Motherboards, processors, and memory to put together an Intel Core 2 or AMD Athlon/Phenom II machine with ~4 GB or RAM; but no extra cases, and the motherboards are kind of crappy

- An Adaptec PCI-X U320 SCSI HBA, an old U160 SCSI RAID card (PERC3, perhaps), a stack (perhaps a dozen) of untested assorted 146 GB U320 (SCA) 10K drives, a couple 68 pin to SCA adapters, and no multidrop cables

- No extra storage otherwise

- 2 x Broadcom quad GigE PCI-E NICs


So, what does /r/homelab think would be best? Should I just bite the bullet on cost and buy a couple of SAS drives to pop into the PowerEdge? Should I set up a network storage machine? OS suggestions? Think I should even bother with those old SCSI drives? Other storage suggestions? Enterprise SATA worth the cost? Thoughts on new vs refurbished vs used? Pro's and con's for local vs network storage for VM's?

My VMs are all running on a single 320GB 7200 RPM hard drive and I am starting to notice a slow down. 

## ESXi HOST SETUP

-----------------

* **Processor:** AMD Phenom II X6 2.8ghz 
* **Motherboard:** MSI 760GM-E51 AM3 760G mATX
* **Memory:** 16GB DDR3 (4x4GB)
* **HDDs (5 on-board SATA):** 
    * 1x 320GB Western Digital (single platter) - Runs ESXi, VMs
    * 3x 1TB - Samsung 7200rpm HDDs (raw deviced mapped to NexentaStor)
    * 1x NON-USED 1TB WD Green drive

* **Guest VMs**: 
    * NexentaSotr - Runs file server, uses raw device mapped 3x 1TB in Raid-Z
    * Ubuntu Media Server - Runs plex, does transcoding, etc
    * Various Window Server VMs - 2x domain test environments
    * PFSense - Routing b/w various vSwitches

## PROBLEM

-----------------
My file server storage is starting to reach it's maximum size and I know that with ZFS, I can't expand my storage unless if I add another 3 disks. I want to redo my storage while also expanding. My motherboard only has 5 on-board SATA ports.

Ideally I would like something like this: 

* 1x 320GB HDD: Runs VMWare + Runs a few key guest VMs (NexentaStor for instance)
* **ESXi Datastore POOL**: 2x 1TB (7200 rpm) mirrored - will act as an NFS datastore for ESXi host, RDM'd to NexentaStor
* **File Server POOL**: 2x 3TB (5400 rpm) mirrored (or 2x 4TB disks) - used for CIFS/SMB sharing, RDM'd to NexentaStor

and MAYBE buy a PCI card to add more SATA ports and do: 
* 2x 1TB (5400 rpm, 7200rpm) with remaining HDDs and add to the file server pool, expanding to 4TB (or 5TB) of space.

I know that a ZFS mirror setup is more ideal for adding storage space in the future, rather than setting up a RAID-Z setup. I would only need to add 2x drives to expand a vdev rather than another 3 disks. 

**How does this sound? Any suggestions?**


## ZFS

-----------------
So say that I go about doing the above. I would obviously add a single 3TB disk to my server, and copy the data over from my 3TB RAID-Z pool. Now all my data is on the RAID-Z and a single 3TB disk. At this point, I would dismantle my RAID-Z pool, attach my 2nd 3TB disk and attach it to the storage pool I created. At this point, the data should then start to mirror. 

Then I should be able to add the reamining 2x 1TB disks and create a pool for my VMWare Datastore and use that to host some of my guest VMs?

I currently rent a townhouse with a few of my friends, we have a cat, and the house is pretty tight in terms of available space. I can't dedicate one of the rooms JUST to house my equipment, I don't want the noise of a rack to bother my roommates, and I definitely cannot frame out a portion of a room for my lab. So I am left with my decently sized bedroom as pretty much my only option. (I am going to look into solutions to keep the fan noise down as best I can, but even if I have to sleep with ear plugs, I am going through with this.)

But the whole townhouse is always dusty, especially my room... I regularly vacuum, wash my sheets, change the filter on the central AC, all that stuff, and I still start getting a fine film of dust and cat hair on my stuff within a day... And my current hardware (in the basement) collects dust to the point where I take them outside every other week to clean with my air compressor.

My landlord will not pay for duct cleaning, and I would rather not have to foot the bill myself... Also, since I do not see myself buying a house anytime soon, I would like to be able to take the setup with me.

Also, since I am sharing utilities with my friends/roommates, I want to purchase a standalone AC unit to cool my equipment. This way I should be able to track my electricity usage and pay an appropriately larger percentage of the bill to keep things fair.

I have been thinking about buying an enclosed rack and venting the AC into it. But the only rack options I have found so far either include vented rear doors, are too small/big (12U - 24U would be perfect), and/or extremely expensive.

######What is the best way to rack my equipment while keeping it cool and dust free (given my situation)?

---

#####Update:
Thanks for the help and recommendations! I just found a 24U rack on craigslist and have arranged to pick it up early next week!

New question: If I were to buy a Tripp Lite SRCOOL12K A/C unit** and use a duct to route the air into the front of a 24U rack*** what is the best way to distribute the air flow? For example if I mount it in the middle of door I feel like I would be neglecting the lower and upper portions of the rack.

Although not new to computers I am new to servers. I picked up a dell cs24-sc to mess around with (no operating system pre-installed). From what I gather about these servers, there was a lot of them made and they are fairly basic but they are supposedly custom servers. that being said, I can't find any real documentation on them, The one I got is 4 73Gb hard drives, 16GB RAM, and 2 2.5 Ghx Xeon processors. 

I figured servers would be like desktops in the way the operating systems are, but I was wrong. Since the drives were blank and no cd-rom drive is attached I used a usb bootable drive to load up an OS and there-in lies my problem. No matter what OS I used (windows server 2008 32 or 64 bit, Ubuntu server 32 or 64 bit) I couldn't get past the windows logo for windows, or the language selection screen for ubuntu, it would just black screen (ie show the windows logo, then try and go to the next screen but all that came up was black).  The only thing I could get to load was a ubuntu desktop live cd and obviously that won't work for my situation. I also tried to install an OS over the network but same issue. Since I am new to servers, is there something I can try? Is it a driver issue of some sort? Bad hardware?

The second part of the topic is this, what to put on the server. I have been a windows guy for awhile, but I've wanted to try linux on a server, so does anyone have a recommendation for a distro that is beginner friendly but powerful? My main things I'm looking to do is file server and hosting a few small games, although that is subject to change as new ideas come to mind? I'm hoping the reddit community can give a first time server owner some advice! feel free to ask questions and I'll give a response as quick as I can, thanks.

So every save on a Windows 7 machine would really write to the NFS turning them into thin clients. Same for Linux machines.


So what do you think about the idea? A striped RAID 0 Array to store data as fast as possible before we have a chance to write it to a RAID 1 array.

Essentially the RAID 0 acts as a cache until we have a chance to copy the data onto the RAID 1 Array

I hope the table at the bottom formats correctly. 

I want to build a solid home server that can run plenty of VMs, and do so pretty cheaply. The base OS would be ESX (4 for now, with 5 incoming once work switches.) I plan on needing to run 20+ VMs (maybe not all at once, but at least 10 at once.) 

I have an idea here, and I am hoping for advice about it. This (and many other) mobo has an internal RAID controller for 6 of the 8 SATA ports. I figure if I get these Raptors (cheap) into those ports, I should have a pretty solid amount of bandwidth for the price of the drives. I am very spoiled with a Fiber-Channel SAN at work, and the system I will be bringing up at home will reflect what I have at work. I need power on a budget. 

I haven't found a lot of people using the built-in RAID controller, or opting for Raptors (although I see a lot of discussion about SSD.) 

I have an SSD in my laptop, and love it but IMHO the reliability isn't there. I am also in for discussion about Intel vs. AMD. I like the price point here, but I am at least 3 years behind in the processor wars and even cursory reading seems to say that AMD is only a good choice in some situations. Lastly, from what I understand about RAM clock speeds I don't think I am losing much for not going with the absolute fastest stuff money can buy. I have chosen a good ""middle ground"" (I think) for the 32 GB of RAM here. 

So, any and all advice is welcome.

More importantly, I need to make sure basic internet service keeps working in the event the SAMBA4 VM goes down.

So I'm thinking that pfSense should provide DHCP, but I should set up the SAMBA4 VM to do it's own DNS, then point pfSense to it, but also have some extra DNS servers in addition to the VM, &amp; tell pfSense to go top down always.  Then I would set up DNS forwarding on the VM to go to some public DNS (my ISP's or Google's or something).

I was going to go with 8C Xeons, but I'm wondering if 3 servers running 2x 16 core 6300 series Opterons might not be a better fit. Nothing we run is really that intensive so single threaded performance isn't so important compared to having lots of threads in a 6U block. However, it's an Intel shop and I'd need a good reason not to go with Intel again.

TL:DR... Is AMD worth purchasing if you want lots of threads for cheap, or is Intel a still a better choice? It's been years since I looked at AMD seriously.

Anyway, I’m looking to build a new server to replace that one to finally start messing with some of the newer Windows OS and Servers coming out. If I can get it expensed from work, I’d put VMWare on it, otherwise it would be Hyper-V. 

Keep in mind that not all of these would be powered on all the time. The AD and Exchange/Lync VMs would be the ones powered on for most of the time.

I’m hoping to have a server that can support 10-15 VMs, including:

* Exchange 2007/2010/2013 – With roles spread out and some HA for CAS/HUB/MBX
* Lync 2010/2013
* Sharepoint 2010/2013 – More testing and learning than anything. I’d leave it powered off most of the time
* SQL Server 2012
* 2-3 Active Directory/ADFS servers
* Win 8
* Possibly SCOM
* Couple of very low-util Linux VMs

My budget is about $800. I’ve been out of touch with the latest CPU/mobo/RAM types so have little idea of which ones to even look at on PCPartBuilder.

I plan to reuse the disk (4 x 1.5T SATA) but I'm stuck on whether to upgrade the guts with a spare Core2Duo setup (2.6GHz, 4GB, SATA2, junk ECS board) or a Dell 2950 (dual 3GHz, 4GB, PERC 6).

I have an existing 2950 with dual 3GHz and 16GB with 15k SAS drives that I'm using for an ESX box, and I could use the second 2950 to create a cluster instead of using it as the storage server if the c2d could pass muster.  I'm currently seeing ~18MB/s transfer speeds across the network, and I would like to at least double that.  

If I go with the second 2950 for the storage server, I'm thinking about installing FreeNAS and mounting the share via NFS to the ESX host using the second interface on both servers for the storage traffic.  I'm using a consumer grade 8 port L2 Procurve for the gig switch, and I also have an ASA 5510 but the network behind it is currently flat.   

The whitebox server can hold more drives (the 2950 only has 6 3.5 bays) but the c2d setup does not have onboard gigabit, and it has 4 SATA ports on board and another 4 via PCI controller.  I would probably boot FreeNAS from a USB device so I could use all 6 bays on the 2950 if I go that route. 

What is your take, r/homelab?  Other ideas I may not have considered?  I'm trying to keep the cost minimal, but I do have access to some older enterprise gear for free (Dell 2850s or larger L3 Procurves) but I'm running low on available power and I come from more of a Cisco background so I've never configured trunking on an HP switch.

My plan is to get a small mini-itx motherboard + cpu, preferably with passive cooling, drop in 4x1TB HDDs, and put it in one of those nice cube-like small itx cases. I'd rather have low noise, low power, than performance. I'm plannig on doing a RAID5 on 3 HDDs, and keeping one mounted normally, for non-critical data, like random bittorrent downloads. OS of choice is Debian.

Two questions:

    1. Does this plan sound alright? Would you change anything, or have a recommendation on hardware?
    2. What program would you use to do the backups?

I need help especially regarding no. 2. In the past I have always done some simple shell script with rdiff-backup, but there has to be a better solution. I was pointed at [backupninja](https://github.com/lelutin/backupninja) at r/linux, which seems nice, anyone have some experience with it? I don't necessarily need a 100% bulletproof backup that I can restore the whole system from, I'm looking for something more like a protection from hardware failures, and accidental deletes. I want to keep my personal stuff safe, I don't mind if I have to reinstall the OS from scratch, in case of a hdd failure. It has to handle backups from linux and windows too though.

OK, this is my lab for CCIE with a few servers thrown in. The CCIE lab was built to match the [Internetwork Experts topology] (http://www.ine.com/topology.htm), with a few modifications to the hardware specifications. I have my home networking run though the lab, and I have a number of servers to play around with too.



**Lab Network**

R1: 1841 with 15.1 ADV Enterprise, 384 RAM, 2x WIC-1T

R2: 2650XM with 12.4 ADV Enterprise, 256 RAM, 2x WIC-1T

R3: 2651XM with 12.4 ADV Enterprise, 256 RAM, NM-4A/S

ACCESS: 2511RJ Console Server, remote console access

SW1: C3750-24PS-S with 12.2 ADV IP Services

SW2: C3750-24PS-S with 12.2 ADV IP Services

SW3: C3750-48TS-E with 12.2 ADV IP Services

SW4: C3750-48TS-E with 12.2 ADV IP Services

BB1: 2621 with 12.2 IK903S3 , 64 MB RAM, NM-8A/S 

BB2: 2621 with 12.2 IK903S3 , 64 MB RAM

BB3: 2621 with 12.2 IK903S3 , 64 MB RAM, 1x WIC-1T

R4: 1841 with 15.1 ADV Enterprise, 384 RAM, 2x WIC-1T

R5: 1841 with 15.1 ADV Enterprise, 384 RAM, 2x WIC-1T

R6: 1841 with 15.1 ADV Enterprise, 384 RAM, 1x WIC-1T

Rear side of Rack: APC 7902 PDU, web access for remote power control

All of this stuff is pretty obvious. It’s wired with INE topology provided above. The only thing really interesting here is that the APC 7902 PDU had a 110v/30a plug, which obviously didn’t fit my 15a wall outlet. I made my own connector (with the safety precaution of not allowing more than 10 amps power draw through the PDU) and it worked great. When in use, the lab uses around 550 watts.


**Home Network:**

Loosely called home network because it provides my network connectivity for personal use, firewall, and remote access and is always on, but it also provides remote access to the CCIE Lab and internet access to the servers.

Router: 3825 with 1GB RAM, 15.1 ADV Enterprise, IOS Firewall, VPN, and WebVPN

Switch: C3750-48TS-E, VLANs with SVIs

CPE Modem

Belkin DIR-615 with DD-WRT acting as a “dumb” access point

Nothing too special here, besides the VPN connectivity and gigabit fiber between router and switch.


**Server Network**

2x Rackable Systems (now SGI) 2u servers. I couldn’t find a model number, but they use a Quanta S45 board with dual Xeon L5420 2.50 Ghz, 16 GB of RAM.

1x [SuperMicro AS1021TM-T+](http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SM-OP25X2-PB-R), contains two servers, each with dual Opteron 2380 2.5 GHz and 16 GB of RAM each 

2x [SuperMicro SuperServer 6015T-INF](http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=SM-QC283X4-PB-R), contains two servers, with dual Xeon E5440 2.83 and 16 GB of RAM each 

All told, there is 64 cores and 128 GB or RAM in the server farm. Each server has a 16GB flash drive (Sandisk Cruzer Micros, about the size of a fingernail) for the ESXi installation. I’m moderately happy with the Rackable Systems. I replaced the fans with 80mm quiet fans from Newegg, and they are quiet enough to run all the time, but they just don’t have the same build quality as the SuperMicro. However, considering my bed is 10 feet away, the SuperMicro servers are just too loud to run 24/7. Incredibly powerful pieces of equipment though.

**Rack and Power**

The rack is a Skeletek C28U-4P-EX16 (http://www.dantraknet.com/category/47). I originally bought the two post rack when it was network equipment only, and it felt somewhat flimsy, with the ability to slightly twist the two poles. Since I got the extensions and some rack rails, the thing seems incredibly strong. I would definitely recommend this.
I also have an APC 2200RM2U. With the all the routers and switches and the two Rackable Systems servers turned on, it barely is at one bar of line load.


**Lessons Learned**

1.	Don’t get 2500 series routers. They seem like they are a great deal for backbone routers (route injection only) because they only cost $20. However, most (including the 2501s recommended by INE) don’t have RJ-45 ports, only AUI Ethernet, so you need to buy an AUI cable and transceiver, which is about $30 dollars a router. Also, you need to find an 2500 series IOS image that supports IPv6, which means you’ll need a new one that’s larger, so you’ll need more RAM. 2500 series RAM isn’t cheap, so expect to end up paying $70 dollars for a single 2500 series backbone router. Considering a 2621 is about $30-40, and probably doesn’t need anything added to it, you’re much better off getting the newer, cheaper, more flexible 2600 series.

2.	1841s are a great choice for a home lab router. They are new enough to support the IOS 15.x series images, they are small, quiet, and use less than 100w. They are fairly powerful and since most came from branch offices, they generally have AIM VPN cards already inside so it’s easier to do VPN stuff, if that’s your thing.

3.	Get a console server for your routers. The annoyance saved by not having to move a console cable around is well worth, plus you won’t be wearing out your console ports and you can access your lab remotely so you can study while away from home. INE recommends a 2509/2511. Look at Lesson Learned #1. 2500 series routers don’t support SSH, telnet only. Get a 2600 series router with a NM-16A, throw in some octal cables, and you’ll spend less and have a more secure console server.

4.	Following on the previous point, getting remote access for power is great too. Having remote access for power means you can save money by leaving equipment off and still be able to turn it on while you’re out. Also, if you’re away from home, you can cycle power to reboot a locked up router.
5.	Rackmounts are an expense I didn’t consider. At ~10 a pop, rack mounts added up quickly. Also, 1841s were originally designed to be wall mounted and didn’t have rack mount points. . I needed a special rack mount for that one. Most 1841s after V01 should have regular rack mount points.

6.	On the server front, the AS1021TM-T+ has two internal USB slots built into the motherboard, while the 6015s don’t, which means mounting the ESXi flash drive was much cleaner and didn’t use up one of the two external USB slots


**Standing Issues**

1.	The one UPS isn’t enough for all the equipment to be run through it. I probably will have to get another one if I want to run everything at once.

2.	I have no remote power control of the servers or home area of the network. A SmartUPS NIC card will probably be added sometime down the road.

The Norco was in the silver 8U rack mount travel case (No, not screwed in at the time). The battery backup is dangling on the wall and yes the server was on while being flung through the air. The server case was completely filled with insulation and the I/O panel for the motherboard was blown out from the inside (talk about air flow). I had offsite backups of my critical data but every drive worked fine. I bought new drives and recovered all of the data from them. I still keep the drives around for extra extra backups and have only had 2 of the 5 drives fail since the tornado.

.|I've pretty much decided against going the Intel way because of the price difference and a lack of upgrade possibilites.

* Buy one or more SSDs.  If you plan to virtualize, this should really be seen as a requirement

* Buy as much RAM as you can afford, 32 GB is a safe number for home builds

* Buy a processor with the right features and the most threads

From what I can tell, running an ESXi box is kinda pointless without a vCenter server, and VMware doesn't currently offer a TechNet license of sorts, so as much as I'd like to learn some of their tech more, since it's industry leading at the moment, I find myself in a position where I HAVE a TechNet license, and can unlock 90% of the VMware features out of the box with Server 2012, like Live Migration from host to host, which honestly is somewhat appealing to me for my studies...


Are there any benefits to continuing to run an ESXi 5.1 system, or have I essentially reached my ""learning limit"" without vCenter and would learn better by making hypervisors uniform in OS...

tl;dr:  Is there a reason to run ESXi and Hyper-V, or would I benefit more (Study wise) going full Hyper-V since I have proper TechNet licensing for that, while I'd be forced to use trialware for VMware stuff, beyond ESXi 5.1....",,False,self,t5_2ubz7,False,,,True,t3_10x0wn,http://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/10x0wn/separate_hypervisors_or_uniform/,

PS: Decent PS, likely Seasonic. I'm thinking 500watt ish to account for HD Draw(likely will expand up to 12 hard drives)

Currently it is running Bay 1 with a 120Gb Intel SSD, Bay 2 is blank (awaiting a 2Tb WD RE4), and Bays 3/4 running WD RE4 2Tb drives.

I have decided to try moving towards ESXI so I can free up Bay 1 as well, allowing 4 drive bays for storage and running ESXI off a flash drive. Currently I am looking into performing a BIOS update to it, since (as I'm being told from various sources) the CS24-TY WILL take ""standard"" C1100 BIOS updates which are available on Dell's website. That will (hopefully) allow me to boot from USB finally.

Once I get that resolved, I am looking at moving all media off the server temporarily and installing the following VMs: FreeNAS to turn drive pool into ZFS (and have it boot first), then have a pfSense, and 1-2 Windows Server VMs running afterwards, stored on the ZFS pool. Is this something attainable, or am I missing out on a key detail somewhere?

The end goal is to free up the drive bay in use by the SSD to use for storage, without spending any more money on hardware just to keep the server running (aside from a flash drive or something small). I looked into PCIe SSD options but the price is ridiculous for a lab setup.

On the networking side - I am currently running the entire network off a 16 port unmanaged switch, with Server 2012 doing the DNS and DHCP work - which I am hoping to pick up with pfSense and use one NIC on the server as a WAN port to the switch.

* Chenbro 3U Storage Server (Core 2 Duo 2.66GHz, 2GB DDR2, 2x 3TB, 4x 2TB, 4x 300GB.) After my RAID config, there is 7.6TB of available space.

* IBM x440 (8x Xeon 1.6GHz, 16GB 168-pin SDRAM)

Sadly, the G3 and G4 are never used anymore due to the power, heat, and performance. Those will be the next to go. I would remove the IBM x440, but 1. its 100Lbs, and 2. its a friends, so I can't do anything with it.

What I use my Lab for is mostly hosting web services (email, websites, minecraft, owncloud, etc), and messing with OS's in VM's (Windows Server, AD and Group Policy, Linux Distros/Programs, Etc.) The 3U is a NFS storage share for my VM Nodes, and my G5 and 2U are my VM Nodes.

For Virtualization I use Proxmox, and the Storage Box runs openmediavault. Everything else runs Debian 6.0.7.

So, any thoughts or feedback on ways I can make this better?

Currently I am using a Dell C1100 server with 2x Xeon L5520 and 36GB RAM. The boot drive in Slot 1 is a 120GB Intel SSD. Slots 2 and 3 are populated with 2TB WD RE4 drives, which are currently in a ReFS drive pool about half filled. O/S is currently Server 2012.


The roles the server is currently performing:

* DHCP server over NIC 1

* DNS lookup for the server (with intention of setting up small LAN webpage on http://server instead of using IP)

* File server (sharing the 4TB drive pool for movies, shows, music, etc)

* Using TVersity for transcoding/streaming of media to roughly 20 ""smart devices"" such as TVs, XBOXes, or PS3s.

* Currently running a Minecraft, UT2004, and CS: Source game server on the LAN.

* XBOXes and other devices hooked into LAN to play multiplayer games and such. Currently we are at ~35 connected devices and growing.


Everything is currently being managed over a single gigabit NIC port to a Netgear unmanaged gigabit switch, which then branches off to 3 other gigabit switches in other locations as our ""backbone"" (broke sailors working here!). We also have some fiber to ethernet media converters running 2 different ends of the network for spots that were longer than 300 meters out.


What I am having a hard time with is boredom and feeling like I could do this all more efficiently. Could I be using VMs under Hyper-V to compartment off some of these functions? Should I be using NIC teaming(currently unused in case I decide to Hyper-V) to have better network stability? And lastly, are there any different applications (like Plex media server) I should consider? With all this power I have available to me, I am most certainly not even using 10% of it, even when half my department is watching shows or such off it.

The start of my home lab. I don't think it's going to grow much until I get a rack now, which is going to mean lots of waiting for someone to be throwing away a 36-42U rack somewhere near me.

Things it will be interesting to find out for when I do expand:

 * Does HomePlug carry dot1q properly?
 * Is it easy to configure Cisco Call Manager or should I go with Asterisk? (SIP trunk and SIP phones)
 * ESXi or VirtualBox or Xen or something else?

Note 2: If you are just starting, do not attempt to replace your DSL modem first (or whatever you use as a termination device for your Internet connection in your home). You will end up with no Internet connection and no Internet connection to help you get back your Internet connection.

My idea was to have two smaller SSDs for two separate OSs (One ESXi, the other Windows 7). And then one large partitioned HDD, or two moderate sized HDDs (one for each purpose). Then I could use something like GRUB to dual boot between the two.

Again, I'm not sure if this is even possible, and would like any help I could get. I'm not current on what the most up-to-date, ""gaming"" video cards are; I mostly deal with underpowered/older hardware (except at work, but that is mostly servers).

If you aren't willing to spend much on your home lab you basically have 2 choices:

**1. [HP Proliant Microserver N40L](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16859107052)** for 350$

**Pros:** 

* Great form-factor and well-built case

* 4 Hard drive bays

* Quiet and low power

**Cons:**

* Only 8Gigs of RAM possible, 

* AMD Turion II Neo is not exactly what you call a ""powerful processor""

* One nic

**2. [SUPERMICRO SYS-5015A-EHF-D525 1U Intel Atom D525 Dual Gigabit LAN w/ IPMI Server Barebone](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816101364)** for 369$

**Pros:**

* Reliable

* 1U

* Dual Intel NIC

* IPMI

* DID I SAY IPMI?!


**Cons:**

* 1U can look weird without a rack

* No space for multiple HDDs


Choose what you need. Basically if you want NAS - get HP microserver, if you are more about experimenting with stuff - go for Supermicro with IPMI. Either way you get nice lab environment for only ~360$. It's a great deal.

 

Now for the exciting stuff. Let's say you want more power and flexibility and you are willing to spend.
I've already posted my homeserver [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/vbloc/not_sure_if_i_should_post_it_here_but_here_is_my/). Now, i was building it around Intel Core i7 processor i had ""lying around'. 

If i was building from scratch right now here what i'd do for ~1000$:

**Case:** **[Fractal Design Define Mini Black](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811352011)** for 99$. It is REALLY good. For 99 bucks! Very slick design and great build quality. Stock fans are quite noisy, keep that in mind.

**Motherboard:** **[SUPERMICRO MBD-X9SCL+-F](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813182262)** for 179$. I know it's pricy, but IPMI functionality, ECC support and Cougar point chipset is worth it. Also note internal usb connector, ideal for hypervisor setup. Great stuff.

**CPU:** **[Intel Xeon E3-1240 V2 Ivy Bridge 3.4GHz](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819117285&amp;Tpk=xeon%20e3%201240v2)** for 285$ - just buy it. It's best what you can get right now on the entire market for this price. 

**RAM:** **[Kingston 4Gb DDR3 1600Mhz ECC Unbuffered](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820239223)** x4 - 128$ - 16Gigs of 1600Mhz, ECC memory for 128 bucks, what's not to like?

**PSU:** Grab something around 500 Watts with cable-management to keep in clean, it's will probably cost around 80$

**RAID controller:** **IBM ServeRAID m1015**, around 100$, don't forget to get cables for it


Add HDDs, coolers of your choice and you get a ~1000$ pricetag, pretty nice, huh?
That's pretty much it, build it, enjoy it.

I'm using a D-Link DSL-504T modem in bridge mode, which I have tested by hooking it up to my MacBook and adding a PPPoE connection, which works almost instantly.

/r/techsupport recommended posting my question on this subreddit!

I have recently started tinkering with networking and conjured up a plan that would require a managed (gigabit) switch with VLAN and IGMPv3 capabilities for working properly. Apart from having at least 8 ports and being OS-independent, there isn't really much more that the switch REALLY needs for my purposes but as I like to tinker around, I certainly wouldn't mind more fluff.

Some initial research showed that the Netgear GS108T-200 fits the bill for a moderate price but given that it's not easy to find detailed opinions on switches with that particular feature set, I would like to ask you if you have any specific recommendations. I'm pretty flexible on the price if it gives me something nice but I suppose going above the $100 to $150 would be a bit overkill.

Mac

Windows

Android

iPhone

Ordinarily my process for this involves hours of googling and research, some trial and error, and the rest is feeling it out as I make progress.

The routing between the two interfaces seems to be working fine, I can ping and remote desktop from one to the other. I can ping the home modem from the vm network. I cannot however get any internet access through to the vm network (can't ping).  
I've disabled the pfsense firewall entirely. I've setup firewall logging on the home modem so that I know the tcp packets are hitting the router and being fowarded to the internet (also tracert shows packets hitting the modem). It looks like nothing is coming back from the internet in the firewall logs though.  
Is this actually a problem with the modem? Is pfsense encapsulating the packets in some weird way due to the WAN port actually being on a LAN? Any thing else I should be looking at?  
  
**TL;DR** Can't get internet connectivity through pfsense.
  
Networking is not my strong suit so any ideas or info would be great!

Wireless isn't an option because streaming 1080p video on the HTPC stutters a whole lot.

Now that I'm getting settled into the place, I'd like to get this long cable tucked away neatly. I've measured it all out, and I know how much conduit/raceway I'll need and in what lengths (to get around corners, up + around a door jamb, etc).

The issue is that I need a bunch of unusually sized runs (1x123"", 3x40"", 1x6"", 1x120"", 1x154"", 1x362""). I'll also need to drop a switch along that path to connect my work desk, but that part isn't so much a problem.

Unsurprisingly, I haven't had much luck finding cable runs pre-cut to those specific lengths. I found this [raceway on a roll](http://www.cableorganizer.com/premiere-raceway/) product that looked like it'd do the job nicely, and I'd only need to buy two rolls to get all of the length I need.

There's only one review for the product, and it basically said ""this shit sucks, 
don't buy it"". One lone review isn't enough for me to completely discount it as an option, but it's not very encouraging either.

Anyone have any experience with products like this, or have a different approach for running long cables around and making it not look like shit?

I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this question (if it isn't please redirect me to one).
So I bought a cheap RAID controller from ebay, an OEM Version of an Adaptec 5805(from Sun).
I wanted to run a RAID 10 array with my 4x3TB WD Reds.
To use 3TB you need a [newer BIOS version](http://ask.adaptec.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/17075) on the controller: 
I downloaded the newest BIOS 8948 from the adaptec website, but I didn't let me update it, because it thinks the BIOS is not compatible
with the card.(Because of the Sun Signature, or serial-number?).
This was my first attempt, with the Adaptec Storage Manager(Software for flashing the BIOS in Windows),
so I thought that this could be an issue with the software.
I read in [this](http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1696205) thread, that there is a ""Mode 0"" switch on the controller, where it lets
you restore the BIOS, without check. They also provided a link to the latest offical BIOS from Intel (which is still not the required version
for 3TB drives)
So I put a jumper on the pins and booted with FreeDOS on a USB-Stick and executed the Adaptec DOS flashing utility ""AFU.EXE"".
I couldn't flash the newest BIOS in DOS either, so I tried the older Intel one.
The intel BIOS flashed without problems, but didn't enable 3TB support (as expected).

Does anyone know, what I can try next? There isn't a lot of information on the net, but I'm sure there are other people with the same
problem.

I want to just build a cheap server and collocate it because it seems cheaper in the long run and I could afford the costs. I currently have a VPS and I need to expand and its been a fun project so far.

I was looking on various sites and because haswell is coming out, they are having sales on a lot of the older processors. I could pick up an E3-1230v3 for around $275 and a cheap barebones 1u rack for about $400ish. Then it would cost about roughly $300 or so for 32gb of the cheapest fastest compatible ddr3 ram. Regardless of storage it would still be around $1k and if I only put in 16gb of ram it would be around $800 or so.

However I was looking at used servers to see if there was any deals and I noticed that some older dual CPU servers are going for very cheap and score fairly well on benchmarks. What caught my eye was a 1u dell poweredge c1100 with the dual Xeon X5570 2.93ghz quad core processors. For $550 it comes with that and 32gb ram which is way more then we would need. While those processors are made in early 2009 they score pretty well on the benchmarks

Dual Xeon X5570s

http://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Xeon+X5570+%40+2.93GHz&amp;id=1302&amp;cpuCount=2

vs

Xeon E3-1230v3

http://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Xeon+E3-1230+v3+%40+3.30GHz&amp;id=1942

I am not sure how that benchmark tests the processors but dual x5570s score 9833 number things vs the E3-1230v3 scoring 9504. They are fairly close in whatever arbitrary benchmark that website does. It seems like the most popular website of its type so maybe I can trust it. The only reason I would consider the dual X5570s is because of all the extra processing threads. It would come in handy when running gameservers and VPSes. I am sure the E3-1230v3 kicks its ass for single thread processing though and absolutely destroys it comparing one x5570 to an e3-1230v3.

However having 16 threads would also help a lot when running multiple gameservers and VPSes. Keep in mind that the games we play are source games like team fortress 2, counterstrike source, minecraft, and hopefully a dayz server when it comes out. Right now my vps is being hosted on a Xeon L5640 and it runs fine although we only were allocated 4 cores and 4gb of ram. Its not bad for $70 a month but I see colocation deals for around that price or even cheaper. It would be nice to double the physical amount of cores and hyperthreading would be great. The S3-1230v2 is much newer though and while it would only be 4 cores with hyperthreading, it would also provide better single core processoring power. It would also use way less power but some of the colocation deals provide power anyway for a single server. The X5570 are already 4-5 years old but they have 4 cores with hyperthreading and support virtualization. There may be some newer processors that aren't insanely priced but for the xeon x56xx series processors, they get into crazy amounts of money. Then the e6 and 7 series of xeons are so insanely expensive that there is no reason not to just get a e3-1230v3.

One of the big reasons I was considering that used server is because it comes with 32gb of ddr3 ram as part of the cost or I could get a 72gb model for $660. Sure its probably all like 4gb sticks of ram but its plenty. It would be nice to pay like $550 and just have to add hard drives. The cost of a cheap 1u barebones supermicro rack and an E3-1230v3 is like $650-750 alone and 32gb of the cheapest ddr3 ecc ram would cost about $300 so roughly 1k total minimum. I could buy two X5570 systems for the cost of one e3-1230v3 and host way more servers :P However I probably should just buy the latest and greatest because it is new and I could upgrade it in the future if needed. However only dropping $550+storage would be nice, especially since half the games we play are a couple years old anyway. However I want to run an arma 3 or dayz and possibly a natural selection 2 server so not all of the games would be old. Minecraft can also use tons of ram and I think the more I have the better. From past experience, I have run a decent minecraft server from a dual core 1.6ghz processor with 4gb of ram though. Having two processors with 8 physical cores sure would help running a lot of servers. However running a modern processor with room to upgrade in the future would also be great.

I am leaning towards getting a brand new system but I am also not trying to spend a lot of money at all on this project. The cost of building a new server is enough to get me a brand new modern gaming pc as well I want to keep it cheap but I know cheap and quality don't go together. Lastly whatever I build and send to the datacenter is probably how it will be. I will probably pick some budget colocation service that would charge me a crapload to put in more ram or extra harddrives so whatever I send is probably how it would remain forever. Thanks for reading this.

Edit: as for replacing parts, if a x5570 died its way cheaper to replace vs a e3-1230v3. Same with the ram. Also I plan on putting in two 120gb SSDs for the game servers and have all my webhosting on two 2TB hard drives.

In fact, I am still kind of fuzzy on all the roles and parts of a home lab. But if I wish to move up from PC Repair shop drone to IT administration I need to learn hands on.

Here's my understanding, please correct as needed. I'll be taking [this](http://www.tekhead.org/blog/2013/01/nanolab-running-vmware-vsphere-on-intel-nuc-part-1/) guys blog and attempting to explain what I understand and what I don't.

A home lab seems to be made of three parts:

1. A head unit that runs what everyone seems to suggest: ESXi. Which is a barebone hypervisor whose purpose is to create virtual machines that act as the different roles in your home lab (and is also free to use on a machine up to 32GB of RAM?). These VMs share the processing power and RAM of the head unit making the CPU and RAM very important.

2. A body which is a storage pool. Many seem to use a NAS like Synology with loads of disks in them RAIDed together. I actually have a Synology myself. I assume the VMs virtual hard disks reside here.

3. A backbone switch to connect it all together and is usually on a separate network so as not to interrupt the home network while tinkering.

My questions are as follows:

* What kind of VM roles are in a typical home lab? I'm assuming a LDAP/AD server, a DHCP server, a web server, mail server, database and perhaps a file server (or you just let the NAS's software cover that role?). Anything else?

* Would an i3/i5 like in the linked article actually handle all that load? Or am I severely overestimating the requirements of these VMs?

* Once setup what does one do to learn about administrating these servers? Simulate users or mail flow? Add VM client machines for testing? Once it's all set up and running what do you do to it to learn more?

* If you max out your head ESXi unit I've seen mention of adding more. This seems straight forward until I see mention of clustering. What does that mean exactly?

To wrap up I think I understand the basis of a home lab but I don't understand the finer details. I see posts about various builds and hardware suggestions but I don't know what the actual use of it is.

Going to throw ESXI on it(flash drive) to practice setting up windows domains, play with linux distros like smoothwall and pfsense, GNS3, and sometime down the road I'll use it for setting up a poor man's OSCP lab. Just wanted to get some input before I pull the trigger on this tonight. (Later on add another ssd or nic if necessary). Trying to keep it under $800 for now(bit flexible on this).

Thanks for the input.


Edit: Forgot to mention I've got a few regular hard drives I can throw in for storage. Also have a HP Microserver N40L doing nothing at the moment. Currently only have 4 GB in it although I know I can get it up to 16 GB with the right combination. May throw FreeNAS on it.

I am looking at a build to replace my aging 3 box NAS and Virtualisation cluster homelab. I now have to share a office with whatever I build whereas it used to live in a cellar. The noise of the current 3xML110 is daft.

Box will run VMWare ESXi with VTd passthrough of the Megaraid controller to a Napp-it or FreeNAS NAS VM. The RE disks will be connected to this controller and the Nas will present storage back to ESX for the rest fo the VMs as well as the network. 

Will run 24x7x365, reliability is key.

1. Intel i7 3820 vs 3770 and Socket R vs 1155
   - My reasoning here is that I can build with 32GB and add another 32GB later, the socket 1155 chipsets only support 32GB max. I will need to give the NAS 8GB of the RAM for ZFS to be happy leaving 24GB for VMs. My existing 16GB farm is maxed out on RAM, so 64GB is attracitve.
   - Socket R may have a longer shelf life, potantial to replace with next gen chips
   - Can I go Xeon dual board and single CPU for similar cost ?
   - However power !! 130W vs 75w for 3770 , £90 a year in extra electricity.
   - VT-d seems very random on motherboard support for 3770.
2. 6x1TB RE disks
   - Similar cost to 3x2TB
   - Gives 5TB useable with Raid-Z vs 4TB with 3x2TB
   - Double the spindles for more performance which ESXi will see as not going over physical network.
   - Power !! Extra 15W £15 a year
   - Anyone disagree with this reasoning ?
   - Any other manufacter worth considering for 24x7x365 RAID ?
3. Case, I want a quiet one but know little about cases these days, is this ok ?
4. Cooler - Is this suitable for 24x7 operation, should i have air cooling instead ?
5. Motherboard assuming 2011 - From research this looks to work with VT-d for ESXi 5.1, any ideas of alternatives ?
   - Only need basic SATA support for the SSD to boot from
   - LAN support nice, but will be adding supported Intel cards anyway so no deal breaker
6. PSU
   - Quiet and reliable, is this ok ?
7. RAM - just picked the cheapest really, don't think RAM speed will ever be an issue given workloads.
8. Far out - Might want to put a fast graphics card in and try and do VT-d to Windows for gaming, anyone every got this working properly ?
9. This is the cheapest video card I could find. I need VGA 640x256, seems overkill, can you still get 2D only cards at low price ?


The alternative is something like this, but worried about motherboard VT-d compatibility

I'm a vmware/linux/storage guy professionally but want to get a home lab rolling.  I only want to have one server in the house and figure I'll throw ESXi 5.1 on it and create a few guests, the most prominent of which will be a fileserver (thinking NAS4Free since I've read good things).

I was looking around at various hardware options (trying to keep it under $1,000 total) and really liked the idea of the [N40L](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=59-107-052) with a [memory upgrade](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148466) and 4x[2TB WD Red](http://www.amazon.com/WD-Red-NAS-Hard-Drive/dp/B008JJLZ7G) drives, but then noticed the darn thing only had hardware raid support for RAID0/1.  I'm not sure if I want to get a hardware RAID card or just look at alternative server altogether.  I'm also not too sure about that Turion II processor it has either, I can't seem to find really good benchmarks about it.  It's not like anything I'll be doing is particularly processor intensive, but I think that's a mobile processor and I'm not convinced it'll do an amazing job.

In any event: I'm not adversed to building out from scratch either, but I haven't had to spec out parts in a while and the research phase can be grueling (which is why I'm here asking you folks!)  Is the N40L a viable route or does anybody have any good suggestions on how to solve this problem?  Ultimately I am going to only have a few guest VMs besides the fileserver.. mostly low-spec linux boxes I can run tests and experiments on outside of work.  The fileserver will be large, though.  It will get the most RAM and gobble up the majority of the ~5.58TB of usable I expect out of 4*2TB RAID5.  I'm eating up 2TB currently on my local desktop drives, it's time for an upgrade there.  Also my current 2TB is not RAIDed in any way which is bad. :|

I've had extemely bad luck with both FreeNAS and Openfiler now and I'm looking for a stable solution that should be able to decently power a few virtual machines from my VMWare host. Other than that I will use it for general media storage, thus the extra disks, but that is not where the priority lies right now.

With FreeNAS I had pretty huge problems with the write latency, for seemingly no reason (other that it seems ZFS does wierd stuff with sync writes), which made me try out Openfiler instead, since it uses much more ""regular"" filesystems. That haven't gone well though since my experience so far is that Openfiler is pretty much the least stable OS you can reach. Write latency and speeds were fine though as long as the OS doesn't fuck up (it's at 80 load avrage now, and counting...)

I recently acquired two Dell PowerEdge 750 servers (I know it's old hardware, but they were free) from a company that was getting rid of them and didn't want to deal with them.  So far, all I've done with them is some hardware upgrades, and installed Windows Server 2003 R2, which is the latest server OS I could get to install.

I have a small network up and running, using a 4-port + wireless consumer-grade switch, and I already have a spare desktop standing in as a file server.

Ideally, I'd like to use these servers to improve the networking setup I have, and/or learn some useful skills for my future sysadmin career.  But I'm not sure what to start with.

What should I do with these two servers?",,False,self,t5_2ubz7,False,,,True,t3_16phb1,http://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/16phb1/new_servers_new_to_admining_what_do_i_do_with_them/,

My current setup is this: RoadRunner modem feeds into an esxi box. ESXI box is running a Server 2012 instance that runs DNS, DHCP, and RRAS and shares the connection to everything else at my house, including a few access points. The server itself is directly connected to modem, and pulls an ipv6 address, and passes all the ipv6 tests, including DNS. my ISP is giving me a true ipv6 address. 

My issue arises in that my dhcp/dns are only configured for ipv4 internally right now. I've seen a ton of conflicting information on the internet. Some people say just turn on RRAS ipv6, no dhcp needed internally, others tell me to enable dhcp for ipv6, but dont give me a known ""non routable/local"" address (do those even exist in ipv6?) Ive tried configuring dhcp with an ipv6 address, and gotten it to work, configured DNS with google's ipv6 dns servers, however, i can never get anything to route out of my internal network...

Basically, my question is, HOW can i enable ipv6 so my machines pull an ipv6 address, its ""routable"" to the world through RRAS, and i can use ipv6 on my internal network other than just link local stuff that i have currently?

Thanks for any and all assistance you can offer!!

Here's what I've got now:

AT&amp;T Uverse Gateway (DHCP server) -&gt; Linksys Wifi AP -&gt; endpoints in 192.168.1.0 network

I have a cisco 800 series ISR router, 2960 switch, and a server for CUCM. What I'd like to do is run the 880 series router off the AT&amp;T Gateway, plug the 2960 into a LAN port on the ISR880, and have that all be the 192.168.2.0 subnet.

I've taken the first steps and connected the 880's WAN port with a LAN port on the AT&amp;T Gateway. The ISR 880 is serving as a DHCP server for the 192.168.2.0 network, with a static route out to the AT&amp;T gateway to get to the internet. When I plug a computer into the LAN port on the 880, the computer is assigned an ip address on the 192.168.2.0 network, and I'm able to browse the internet, ping devices on the 192.168.1.0 network and all works well.

The problem is that any device on the 192.168.1.0 can't ping anything on the 192.168.2.0 network. I'm assuming this is because the AT&amp;T gateway doesn't know how to do any actual routing, so when packets destined for the 192.168.2.0 network hit the gateway, they are dropped? No?

Any suggestions on how I can get this working so that devices on the 192.168.1.0 can ping to the 192.168.2.0 network? I was thinking of connecting the 880 using the L2 ports on the back, so that it's a layer 2 connection, and then creating and assigning a separate VLAN for the other 3 ports, and then setting up an SVI to route between the two networks. Does that sound plausible?

Any other suggestions or best-practices I should be thinking about?

It's a bit of a mess at the moment because I just moved into a new apartment. I'll be doing cleaner cabling once I have the time to measure out how long each patch cable needs to be, purchase some velcro-ties, etc.

Highlights:

 * 75Mbps down / 10Mbps up internet pipe
 * 24 port gigabit switch (no-name brand with limited feature set, needs to be upgraded)
 * Linksys WRT54G wireless router running Tomato

That's nothing special, but the virt + storage box I built is where it gets fun:

 * Some variety of 3U Chenbro case (can't remember the model) with 12x 3.5"" disk bays
 * Supermicro MBD-X8SAX-O motherboard
 * Intel L5630 40W Westmere CPU 
 * 8GB DDR3 ECC unregistered RAM
 * Areca ARC-1120 RAID controller hosting 4TB RAID5 array for media storage
 * LSI Logic 9500S-4LP RAID controller hosting 1.5TB RAID5 array for virt images

The hardware itself isn't earth shattering, but with the super low power CPU with vmx, I can run a dozen or so moderately provisioned VMs without the machine breaking a sweat. I went with the 40W CPU + PWM fan design so it could run silently, as the old server was unbearably loud and power-hungry.

That setup allows me to spin up virt labs for testing and tinkering while still providing my Acer revo running XBMC all of the video + music I'm storing.

Edit: The two 1U servers at the bottom of the rack aren't in use. They're HP DL360 G4 (I think) servers, one with a broken VRM and the other with a bad disk controller.

I've never setup an infrastructure from starch and need advice on where to start how to proceed. While I probably don't need separate VLANs for a home lab I think it would be a good exercise. I will probably put this on the back burner until I figure out a solution that I'm happy with.

I am very impressed with the Icy Dock drive bays! I purchased this case as it had 11 5.25"" drive bays with Icy Dock in mind.

I ended up using 2x -- 3-5.25"" to 4 3.5"" bay adapters and 1x --2.5.25"" bay to 3.5"" as well as 1 5.25 bay for 4 SSD 2.5"" bay.

I am back at an MSP and trying to rapidly broaden my horizons/play with different technologies.  My game plan is to build a Nexenta SAN/NAS and then build a machine to serve as a virtual host.  My goal is to set up an extensive Server 2012 environment, maybe a linux box to play with, and XBMC.  My hardware is going to follow:

**NAS/SAN**

* AMD A10-5700 Trinity 3.4GHz (4.0GHz Turbo)
* MSI FM2-A85XA-G65 Mobo
* 32 GB DDR3 1866
* Cooler Master Storm Stryker SGC-5000W-KWN1
* Highpoint RocketRAID 2720SGL - SAS/SATA Raid Card
* 4x 450GB SAS 15k in a Mirrored Pair
* 3x SATA 3TB in Raidz1 - Will grow pool when space is needed

My game plan is to host all of the VMs off of the SAS drives and then use the SATAs as a domain wide NFS storage dump.  I want to get a 4port NIC and switch supporting LACP to improve performance.  I am also thinking about investing in some SSD's for L2ARC/ZIL but that will probably be down the line.  

**Virtual host**

This is not finalized yet but it will probably be an ESXi box running that 8 core AMD, 32GB RAM, SSD, etc.  

Let me know what you guys think and I will update everyone on the happenings when I start the build.

If I can run LACP trunks (2 bonded ports) between switches, why can't I do the same thing between a switch and a server with 2 NICs?

Result is a 200MBps connection to the switch (I'm too poor for gigabit switches right now) with redundancy. If a cable breaks, gets unplugged, get eaten, etc. everything is fine.

Specs are:

2Gb ram
Dual Xeon 5150 @ 2.66Ghz
6X 750Gb disks

What is a fair asking price for this thing **before** factoring in loyalty/employee discounts? :)

Also, depending on interest, we're also selling the following boxes but I'll probably post this on /r/techforsale:

PowerEdge 860 X 3

I also have a ton of home videos I would like to put on the backup server. My idea was to use buy an HP Proliant DL380 G4 for dirt cheap from a local company and to get an HP Storageworks on Craigslist for around $150. The Storageworks can support up to 12TB I believe and uses SATA disks. I was thinking of using FreeNAS for the server and using Time Machine on the Macs. I have a couple of questions: 1. How would I go about configuring the Storageworks with FreeNAS? 2. What settings should I use inside of FreeNAS? I would like FreeNAS to be configured so at least 1 Hard drive can fail and I can insert new drives into the Storageworks with ease.

Granted, the drives were old, but my overall concern at this point is whether the current performance issues I'm seeing is another drive failing, or if there's room to optimize performance.  The four drive array consists of eight VMs.  I know it's not CPU or RAM because I've under provisioned on those.  However I also configure the servers on dynamic disks rather than fixed disks, so I know fragmentation starts to become an issue.  The partition is also a ReFS partition.

I'm currently using a NoSQL database, since structure varies between websites. I'm using MongoDB because from what I understand it stores everything on the disk as opposed to in RAM. These documents are imported in bulk and fairly frequently - depending on how many users are on the site.

I guess two important things for me would be speed - it shouldn't take any time to load a document - or a thousand documents ideally.

Also, the rate at which I receive these documents could increase, as well as their size.

I'd like to set up ESXi on whatever I pick both to learn it and to support some other learning I want to do (Puppet, nagios/zabbix etc). I would need one VM on it to handle fileserver duties and streaming duties. This is what the current box is used for now and it works well. Due to it's current config I don't think it will be too big of a deal to run it as a vm. I don't stream/transcode HD much at all.

For other VMs I'm thinking mostly low powered/low needs VMs just for learning some of the technologies I mentioned above. Maybe 3vms at a time + the streaming server vm (which I'll allocate more ram etc to)

So I'm looking for a good MB/CPU/Ram combo to start out.

I keep thinking that the quad core AMD processors I'm seeing for ~80 and accompanying MBs for about the same price and 8gb of ram (2x4gb) is the way to go for around $200.
