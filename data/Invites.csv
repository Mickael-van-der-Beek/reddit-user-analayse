I'm looking to give out 5 IPT invites to experienced users. No, you don't need a seedbox, but it is preferred.

**What I need:**

1. Any type of proof that you're responsible at maintaining a ratio. (pics/links)
2. Email address.

Recently there was a change to IPT where there is a Hit &amp; Run system to pretty much if you download a torrent, you have to either seed back what you downloaded or you seed for a certain amount of time to earn enough points to remove the Hit &amp; Run strike from your account. If you get too many strikes against your account for Hit &amp; Run's, then your account can be deactivated. Read more [here.](http://pastie.org/4587394)

If you think you can handle that, then post here or PM me. Whatever you feel more comfortable doing.

P.S. - Just as a precaution, I'm not going to invite you if your reddit account isn't at least 4 month's old or so.

**Edit:** aaaaand gone. Better luck next time folks. Those of you who got invites, enjoy.

I may or may not be back with more invites later depending on if these 5 I invited go well. Stay tuned.

**DO NOT, under any circumstance, trade, sell, or buy invites to any private website in this subreddit. Posts asking for trades will be removed. Repeat offenders asking for trades will be banned from posting.**


Now, onto the ""why."" The spirit of /r/invites is to share freely the awesome private sites we're all part of. Invite trading implies that you need a reward for inviting someone - you should be doing so out of the kindness of your heart, or you should not be using /r/invites.

On many private sites (especially file sharing ones), trading, buying, and selling invites is considered a massive offense, and will usually get your account banned.

**For your own safety and the safety of your accounts, DO NOT under any circumstances trade, buy, or sell invites on /r/invites.**

If you want an invite, post here, and include at least 2 proofs of good ratio. When posting ratio proofs in public remember to only include what's necessary to see the ratio, so your nickname on the site should be marked out unless you don't care which is fine, your responsible for what happens to your account I'm just trying to help. 

Make sure you write out and make it visible somewhere in your ratio-proofs today's date and your reddit nickname  in the address bar/search bar..etc.  

For those of you who can't provide a ratio-proof to show a speedtest.net result a long with today's date and your reddit nickname in the address bar/search bar..etc.  

I will contact you regarding the invite. Those with ratio-proofs have a better chance at getting an invite than those without. I don't care if you have a seedbox.

A few quick updates to organize things a bit better around here.

* When permitted by the site, please write out the name and include the abbreviation (for example: ""BaconBits"" is also ""bB""). 

* Please respect sites who wish to not have their full name or URL posted - I will remove posts that do so. The last thing I'd want is for this place to get blacklisted by a bunch of sites for breaking rules, thereby ruining the invite fun for everyone.

* Your post should either request an invite or offer an invite. **DO NOT** offer and request in the same post! Doing so encourages trading (which, as you remember, is [not allowed on /r/invites](http://www.reddit.com/r/Invites/comments/lhnr4/mod_a_few_words_on_invite_trading_selling_and/)).

* Please tag your posts properly. 

        [W] - means ""Wanted."" Use the [W] tag if you're requesting an invite.
        [O] - means ""Offered."" Use the [O] tag if you're offering an invite to somewhere.
        [CONSOLIDATED] - this is only used by moderators for popular sites to reduce clutter.

* If you're offering invites and have an unlimited number, please state so in your post title.

* Please edit your post and update as you give away the invites.

* When you request an invite that requires a ratio proof or profile link, don't complain when the inviter requests it!",,False,,t5_2qlqi,True,,,True,t3_lig7u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Invites/comments/lig7u/mod_new_post_structure_now_with_tagging_goodness/,moderator

~~New members have to go through some rigid requirements before being considered as full members. Anyone interested needs to carefully review the following:~~

**1.** *If you failed to meet the following requirements, new users would be banned after 30 days from the date of registration, regardless of signing up though invites or open registrations. Further, a new account created by open registration with no upload or download behavior in the first 3 days will be banned, while 7 days for registration through regular invitation.*

**2.** You **MUST** achieve 30G for both the minimum uploading and downloading amount as well as gaining ""seeding"" bonus no less than 4000 points in 30 days from the date of registration.*

**3.** *All members have to share back what they took. Your ratio is the amount you've uploaded divided by the amount you've downloaded. You have to maintain your ratio not lower than your required ratio, or you may lose access to new seeds or the site.*

• *If you have downloaded less than 10 GB, your required ratio is 0.3.*

• *If you have downloaded more than 10 GB, your required ratio is 0.4.*

• *If you have downloaded more than 20 GB, your required ratio is 0.5.*

• *If you have downloaded more than 50 GB, your required ratio is 0.6.*

• *If you have downloaded more than 100 GB, your required ratio is 0.7.*

*If you haven't met the required ratio after four weeks since registration, you will receive a system warning and you'll be on ratio watch.*

~~As you can see, this isn't for everyone. That means PM me **two very good ratio proofs** and **profile links**. This wouldn't be on a first-come, first-serve basis so please be patient.~~

So I haven't revisted any private trackers in awhile but now that i'm back home and my ISP likes to send me letters because Ive been downloading from piratebay, i'd like to join back up on FunFile.org. An old friend of mine gave me an invite because he was in. This was the only private tracker i've ever used so unfortunately I don't have any other proofs to show, but I always had more of an upload than a download. 

I think the reason why my email isnt in the database anymore (for password recovery) is because its been close to 2 years since i've used the account and I think they might prune emails. 

Heres my download/upload. I've also been a Redditor for a year if that helps.

I kept my ratio at a neat 8+, with me ending at about 10 and about 1.5 TB uploaded at the time of its disappearance. I never thought to take a screenshot of my ratio or anything since for one I had never heard of a website like torrent-invites.com, but I also wasn't expecting superseeds to go down. 

Looking back it should've occured to me that it was too good to last forever, having 720p releases of F1 only hours after airing, every single race.
Either way, that doesn't matter now since apparently superseeds is dead and I need to start looking at alternatives. From what I understand xspeeds is basically what spawned superseeds, so my hope is that it'll have alright F1 releases, and possibly other sports too. So my hope is that someone will have an xspeeds invite to throw my way.

I've only been a part of two private torrent sites before, superseeds being my second one, torrentleech being my first. My first torrentleech account got removed due to inactivity, and I don't even remember when, but I think I started using torrentleech some 6-7 years ago and if memory serves kept a 2-3 ratio back then, even though my internet was shitty.

So it all boils down to me asking a nice soul out there to throw me an xspeeds invite so I can start contributing. :]
If anyone happens to know of another good site for F1 that'd be great too, since that's my main attraction.


Oh and obviously I didn't get a 10 ratio with 1.5 TB uploaded from just F1, I got tons of miscellaneous stuff too whether it was movies, the Walking Dead, Game of Thrones or whatever else I felt like watching.

I'm hoping someone here would be kind enough to gift me with a TorrentLeech invite. I left the torrenting scene for usenet shortly after oink went down (yeah remember oink?). I've only just got started with torrenting again last week (I'm an NZBmatrix refugee). I plan to use the TorrentLeech account with CouchPotato so I'm sure it will get a ton of use.

The list below contains all the trackers i'm currently in and my ratio. Of course, I will provide proof via PM. I know most of the accounts are very young but hopefully they show I will take the account seriously. Also, I have a Feral seedbox and will happily provide proof of that as well. 

Thanks guys.
