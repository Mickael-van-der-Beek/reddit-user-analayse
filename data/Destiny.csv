1351181555.0,738,self.Destiny,122kop,"""What's been going on?"" - An Update",NeoDestiny,947,209,512,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/122kop/whats_been_going_on_an_update/,"So it seems kind of strange to fly all the way to Poland, + fly out ex and child, + spent $x a month just to play a bunch of Dark Souls and LoL. The plan was to play SC2 hardcore for 3 months to see if I could be incredibly competitive when I left. If not, I'd switch off the competitive part of SC2 and either move into purely the entertainment side, or switch to a different game.

Over the course of the past few months, things have been bothering me with the progression (stagnation? *regression*?) of the scene. The people in the scene (casters, community figureheads, players) are completely out of touch, the community is confused and conflicted, and Blizzard is woefully inadequate.

After watching the game dwindle for quite some time, or at least not grow explosively like I'd hoped it to, I started to think about things that I could do, personally, to see some kind of growth. I thought about how people like Day9 and Husky bring people into the scene. I thought about the success of other games, like LoL and DotA 2, and what they're doing differently that could help us.

Then I thought about how I ever got into games.

I played Starcraft: Brood War for 10 years. I never played it ""seriously"" until the last year or so, and even at that I only made it to C+/B- by massing games at the end of a season on ICCup.

Here was my routine -

1) /f all to see which friends are online. I can see in one glance who's in a game, who's in a chat room, and who's idling/afk.

   a) from here, I could go hang out with said friends in a chat channel and shoot the shit for a while. I'd also be introduced to/talk to anyone else in the channel that they'd had with them. It was a cool and incredibly laid back way to get introduced to people.

   b) from here we could search for games together, no problem. Or, if we wanted to fuck around but didn't want to do it in a chat room, we could watch a replay together. If he had a funny game he wanted to show me, we could literally make the game and watch it together while chatting and laughing about it.

2) if no one was really on, I could host a game or join one that was already made. Very rarely (if ever) did I log onto b.net to grind out some 1v1's. Team games were okay, but the UMS scene was gold. ""DIPLO 7.7 LAG=BAN"" ""2V2V2V2 BGH FREE BEER"" ""PHOTON D NO NOOB!!"" ""3V3 ZC LAG=BAN"" ""2V2V2V2 FASTEST NR20"".

3) my favorite option, sometimes I'd head into channel sex, gay, Town Square, clan x17, clan lzh, clan sphere, or clan OD, just to fuck with people.

I met so many people through those Brood War chats. I remember one chick I met via the chats, isolationgirl. I haven't talked to her since Brood War, but I remember that we'd chat occasionally and one of the conversations we had  somehow ended up on music. At the time of our chatting, my favorite bands were Shine Down, Taking Back Sunday, A New Found Glory, and 311. I also listened to a fair bit of video game music. She told me to check out a couple of bands, Pain of Salvation and Riverside. After opening me up to the world of prog, I haven't looked back since. I kind of wonder if I hadn't had been exposed at that point to other types of music (beyond what's found on the radio or talked about in school) what my tastes in music would be like today.

I remember me + Frank (a mutual friend of me and Kyle) trolling this kid online so hard, his name was ""Meatwagon"", we ended up getting his mom to ban him from Battle.net forever. Somehow we'd gotten his phone number and prank called him a few times, saying stupid shit to his parents (whatever 15 year olds do) when they'd finally picked up the phone.

I remember when I was 17 years old and living with my grandma and I had no ride to school because my grandma didn't drive, I literally was hanging out in a channel on U.S.East all night chatting with people and  managed to stumble upon someone who lived only 30 minutes away. Looking back, that probably wasn't the safest or smartest thing I'd ever done, but hey, I was able to get to school that day.

I played quite a few games when I was younger. I remember absolutely loving Halo when it came out (OMG VEHICLES? and PLZ that last level EPIC AS FUCK). I remember loving FFVII and FFIX and hating FFVIII (junction system fuck you) and always disagreeing with Kyle about it. I loved Ocarina of Time and I cringed at the time system in Majora's Mask, but trudged through it anyway. I was absolutely fascinated by the idea of X-Box live and bought a few games to play online the first month it debuted, because playing people online using consoles was pretty much unheard of back then. Despite all of these different things going on, Brood War was a pretty central part of my life. I always found myself logging into Battle.net to hang out and chat with people.

When I compare all of these warm, fuzzy feelings to SC2, I realize that there is nothing comparable, and never will be, with the current system in place. Battle.net feels like a barren wasteland. We had to fight the developer just to get chat channels implemented, and even with them in it just doesn't feel right. There are so few lines of text that can fit, it's a pain in the ass to scroll up because any time someone hits enter the text resets, you're never even forced into a chat channel originally so you have the ability to never join one...It's just a mess. It feels absolutely terrible.

If I didn't play SC2 professionally, I could never see myself buying it. Why on Earth would I ever get a game that's so centered around this cut-throat competitive side that just doesn't appeal to most people? Fuck, even if I want to 2v2 with my girlfriend or 3v3 with a couple friends, I still get assigned a rating for it.  So now, instead of fucking around and enjoying ourselves, I actually have friends that stress over winning team games? No way man, fuck that.

When I first came over to SC2, I was most excited because my two best (only?) friends were coming over with me, Joe and Kyle. I had a few friends from BW that I knew, too, who also came over. We all were in the Beta, and it was going to be super awesome because we were going to practice hard and all be professional gamers together. Just like when we watched Flash and Jaedong and all of these other guys in the OSL; that was going to be us.

Every person that I knew couldn't stand the game for more than a month. Kyle doesn't play, Joe got bored and still plays Brood War, and everyone else similarly lost interest.

This was **after** us being so incredibly hyped for this game that it was unbelievable. I remember sitting on AIM freaking out with a friend when SC2 was originally announced. My friend was fluent in Korean and was translating the Blizzard announcement as it was being broadcast live.

------------------------

I've talked about stuff like this so much, and I know a lot of people are tired of hearing my thoughts on it by now. I'm not trying to nostalgia-fag anyone, I'm just hoping that you understand that I completely feel what it means to be a casual gamer. It's not dirty, there's nothing wrong with it, and I had more fun in that time period than at any other period in my life. Falling asleep in class because I played one too many 2v2v2v2's, sleeping in and being late to school because I really wanted to master Wizard on Ramza so I spent an hour the previous night with him in a corner screaming until I'd had enough JP to learn everything, etc...etc...

I'm pretty far removed from that, now, but I remember it, and I know what it was like. So when I see all of these other people ""in the scene"" speak about what we need to do to ""grow the community"" and ""expand e-sports""...it just feels strange. It feels awkward, and alienating. It feels like I'm watching a politician on stage who's a multimillionaire saying ""I know what it's like to be poor! I know what it's like to be working 60 hours a week just to make the rent!""..and all I can think is, ""Man, fuck you, you don't know what it's like, stop feeding me that bullshit...""

Doa, Grubby, Artosis...all of these guys writing about the state of the metagame, or ""just have hope and everything will get better!""....man, battle.net sucks, it's **terrible**. SC2 was supposed to be **the flagship of e-sports**. When SC2 came out, the foreign scene actually got involved and exploded as a result. For the first time ever there was more money to be made in the foreign scene than in Korea for Starcraft. If you'd had told anyone that 5 years ago, they'd have said it was impossible, that Korea will always be the mecca of Starcraft. Although that holds some truth today, the foreign scene still  has a ton of interest.

You don't understand how angry it makes me...I've talked about it on stream before, that I **cannot fucking stand politics**...not because of anyone's particular views, but because it's all a big joke. These guys talk the talk, but they'll backstab you for their corporate lobbyists in a split second. Obama talks about unprecedented transparency and how the Democrats hate the Republicans for their wars and fear-mongering, yet the Patriot Act gets bipartisan support for re-approval for Congress. The Democrats have always been opposed to huge businesses getting government tax breaks, yet there was bipartisan support for the $700billion in bailout money...that all went to huge businesses. Why would a party that historically stands for ""the working man"" and ""against big business"" subsidize all of their losses with our tax money???

Sorry, this has nothing to do with politics. It's just, you don't understand how angry it makes me to hear someone like Idra talk about ""Blizzard's done everything, we can't rely on them for anything, we just have to do what we can now for the scene."" What the fuck, you're ready to throw in the towel, then? Battle.net will always be a barren wasteland?

Or Geoff's ""The scene's doing fine, I'm getting a raise next month!"".....do you think the average guy who doesn't log onto Battle.net anymore because it feels like a graveyard cares that you're getting a raise on your paycheck? Why would you even say that? What does that have to do with how the average person feels about Starcraft in any way, size, shape or form?

""You don't want to be part of this money grab, the big boys club, the e-sports gravy train? Then go back to LoL."" So since the solution might be difficult or I'm acknowledging that there are problems, the only real answer is to just ""fuck off"" to a different game? Is that what you would tell every single fan who's tired of SC2 because the game offers nothing for the non-competitive person?

I may say some mean things, but I try to be the most inclusive guy ever. I **hate** cliques, I can't stand ""scenes"", and I love including as many people into things as possible. That's the reason why I'm the most visible person on forums like screddit and teamliquid, despite the haters/trolls. It's the reason why I make an effort to remain visible at public events and to stay and sign every single thing a person brings me, or talk to every single fan that wants a word. It's why I talk to and interact with my chat as much as possible. It's why I respond to **every** e-mail that's sent to me. It's why I've read almost every word said about me online, whether it's on screddit, teamliquid, or my youtube channel.

If we owe our livelihoods to the community, how can we ignore them so hard and pretend we live in a bubble that exists in a separate world from them?

---------------------

**So what now?**

I'm not sure. I had the misfortune of speaking to a Blizzard rep, the same guy, coincidentally, that's going to give JP some ""sick information"". I'm pretty sure that I already know what information he's going to give him, and I know how the community will react. At first everyone will say it's pretty neat, because it gives players an incentive to play some more, but it's all still focused around ""being competitive"". After hearing him tell me about some of the problems that Blizzard has when dealing with some issues, I was 100% certain that nothing was going to change.

Nothing significant will change with the Battle.net interface. I've been so torn over the past few weeks whether or not I should just dump the chatlog on screddit and peace the fuck out (which is what most of you would do if you honestly saw it), but I literally promised him at the beginning of the message that I would keep everything private, and I'd feel like a scumbag for leaking it (and maybe even costing him his job? if there's enough negative blowback).

I thought about transferring to something else in SC2, such as entertaining or casting. I figure if SC2 has enough money in it to make a sustainable career in either of those, there should be enough money in it to continue streaming + training and playing.

So if that's a no-go, the next step is to switch games. The choices are then either LoL or DotA 2. As much as this community seems to love DotA 2, I honestly feel like LoL will be the bigger game for the next several years, making it the obvious choice to transfer to.

I'm not 100% switching yet; it's impossible right now for me to do it. My heart is still with SC2; I've put so much time into anything in my entire life. My marriage failed because I was too busy juggling work and school, and I flunked out of school, giving up really my last joy in life (music) trying to keep up with my 60 hours a week at a casino job, and then I even managed to lose that. SC2 is the only thing that I've been reasonably successful in, and the thought of all of the time I've put into it essentially being wasted by switching games destroys me. It's frustrating enough being ""bad"" at SC2, where I'm in the top .1% of players around the world, but to be ""bad"" in a game where I'm barely in the top 30-40% of players? It's absolutely excruciating, I almost can't even bring myself to stream the learning process and the growing pains that happen along the way.

-------------------------

This has been the most disorganized rambling of thoughts I've ever posted before. I thought about organizing this into a coherent something that I could post on the main screddit to try and get people united behind some changes for SC2, but I now know that Blizzard isn't really in a position to implement anything that would fix our problems. And even if they were, the main figureheads of this community are too out-of-touch with the average person to even know what they'd want, so all of the white noise would lead to nothing constructive getting done that increases the actual player base in the game.

I don't know what I'm planning on doing for the future, but right now it's really starting to look like LoL. Leaving this game is almost impossible for me, but I just don't see any other way out right now. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks for supporting me by watching my stream. I promise that when I know something concretely I'll let you all know.

It was relatively docile before but it's been bustling a lot lately. Just sharing a few ideas/thoughts I've had recently with you guys to keep you updated on what's going on.

- What about Dota 2?!

No, I'm not going to play it, stop asking about it, stop posting your 15 page diatribes about it, I know it might be better/you love Valve/etc...etc...etc...And all of those reasons are great and right and valid, but please, you're wasting your time explaining away all of these things to me. I've heard them a million times before, I swear!

- Are you ever going to play SC2 again?!

I'm thinking about trying to balance my time where I play several hours of SC2 a day and several hours of LoL a day, or something similar like that. The only problem with that is that I won't be at the same level with SC2 as I was before by playing that much and it will slow down any progress with LoL.

I've thought about doing some different things with SC2, then, since I'd only be playing it for a few hours every day. I could start achievement whoring (FFAs, team games vs comps, etc...etc...), and racking up 'dem points does have some appeal to me. I know trolling lower league games is exciting for viewers, but I can only do that for a game or two before it drives me crazy.  I could also just go back to grinding the ladder, but I'm not sure how I feel about doing that only playing so many hours a day. I could also move into a purely informative category. Regardless of my assholeishness/etc.. I think I do have a penchant for teaching, so I could try to publish strategy guides or build orders and do videos and such on that (something along the lines of what Day9 does, more or less).

Any ideas here? I'd be interested in hearing them.

- Other ideas

I've thought about doing a ""Let's Play"" series on my Youtube where I run through different games and compile the entire playthrough on my Youtube into playlists for different games. Is there any interest in something like this? The only qualifications for this is that I'd almost always be using a walkthrough and I'd be insanely anal about getting everything. I'm about halfway through FFVI and can't find myself finishing it now because I checked a guide and realized I've already missed some shit that I won't be able to get again. ._.

Thanks again for the posts and ideas, I love all of my children very much. &lt;3",,False,self,t5_2qnvz,False,,,True,t3_131wif,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/131wif/some_words_and_thoughts/,

The main page is almost done, I'll have the wordpress going soon, too, once my beautiful South African designer finishes his slave labor. I'm looking at an ETA of these in &lt;  1 week, hopefully sooner.

Everything so far has been playing out pretty much exactly as I planned it would. The switch to Twitch.TV was good, and I'm seeing some noticeable improvement in my LoL play. After hitting 1800, it seems more people are willing to click on my stream to give it a try, and my average viewership has popped up quite a bit.

Towards the end of my SC2-ness, if I was trying -very- hard to be entertaining, and I was streaming at prime American hours, it seems my viewership would peak at around 3-3.5k, if I was lucky. If I was just grinding and not talking much, it'd be around 1.2-1.6k.

Playing LoL now, without trying much I seem to easily get around 3-3.5k viewers. If I ""try"" hard to communicate a lot or duo with a friend, I seem to get upwards of 4.5-7k viewers, which is a significant improvement (pretty much doubling or tripling my previous income).

A few things to note:

1) I'm still not at a level of skill in LoL as compared to where I was in SC2. In SC2 Masters league is considered to be ~top 4.5%, and GM is top 0.2% (according to sc2ranks). In LoL right now I'm within the top 1% of ranked players (according to these guys http://www.lolsummoners.com/?byName=NeoD%C3%A9stiny), so I still have a bit to go until I'm at the same level of skill I was at in SC2.

2) One thing that I'm kind of happy of is that I didn't really have to use any of my relationships with other streamers as leverage for getting a foothold in the LoL streaming community. The lessons with doublelift were fun, and I got a bit of a viewer bump when I did them (about 3k?), but other than that I haven't really had to beg Dyrus or Phantoml0rd for duos or anything to see noticeable gains in viewer numbers. My friends and connections in the scene were kind of my ""trump card"", so to speak, if I couldn't gain viewers on my own, but I gained viewer so quickly that I didn't have to resort to that, which is good.

3) Website is finally coming along, which is nice! I think I made a total of $6 yesterday in ad revenue for the site, I'm super excited to finally have my own site off the ground that I can update and manage completely on my own (with the help of my wonderful buddy, Ceneza).

4) The vitriol from SC2 kids that come into my chat or post on r/sc about how much better their game is etc...etc...than any other game is insanely fucking toxic, and is really disgusting to me. This includes all of the people who spam my youtube vids with ""why do u play this child's game"" and ""pls stop this shit and come back to SC2"".

Any other questions on shit? I think this is a decent update for now concerning how things are going.",,False,self,t5_2qnvz,1357314997.0,,,True,t3_15ycyx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/15ycyx/sup_d00ds_an_update/,

[How many of you chat](http://strawpoll.me/76851)?

Subscriptions 

- Will be handled 100% by my website, no longer via twitch

**THE BAD**

* No more fancy symbols in chat if you are a subscriber (there's no way around this)
* No more ad-free stream (adblock exists, I doubt anyone subscribes just to remove ads)

**THE GOOD**

* I get 100% of your money and love and support
* Entry into the fantasy league ([Should you be subscribed for all 3 months to be eligable to win a prize?](http://strawpoll.me/76825))
* Flair on my subreddit
* Ability to vote on what game I play next or what I do (open to whatever I feel like taking votes)
* Ability to play with me on certain games (ARAMs? DayZ?)
* Ability to choose length of subscription
 - Subscribe for one month for $5.00, option to do recurring payments
 - Subscribe for three months for $12.00 ([Is the ability to choose subscription links good or bad?](http://strawpoll.me/76830))

Overall, [how do you feel](http://strawpoll.me/76836) about the new subscription system being handled by me directly as opposed to twitch.tv, taking into accounts the good and the bad of both?|

Chat

- Would like to move chat to an independent system, such as Rizion

**THE BAD**

* Inability to use the chat on the main twitch.tv
* Scary/dissuasive to new viewers of the stream

**THE GOOD**

* More reason to visit my website
* More shit I can do with the chat (We build our own HTML5 frontend for chat, so Kappa/FrankerZ/OMGSCoots etc.. could all easily be ported over, + new symbols for subscribers/chat icons etc...)
* Greater moderating abilities on my end
* More stability and features available

How are [your overall feelings](http://strawpoll.me/76869) about a new chat?

Website design

* Working on having a bigger stream window

Any other website problems/suggestions?

Fantasy League

* Going to be locked so that only people who are subscribed for the full season can win prizes

Season ending soon, any suggestions/ideas?

I actually managed to find a pretty good sketch of her [Exhibit A.](http://i.imgur.com/FfictuP) Please don't message me with how I found it, I won't be able to tell you.

Anyway, XJ9's [girlfriend](http://i.imgur.com/aerhldm) used to live in China (I think it was China, but I can't remember exactly), but now she lives in [Virginia,](http://i.imgur.com/awvGAEq), though he didn't know the name of the city, or even what part of the state it was in. It took him a couple of minutes to magically find the city on google maps and send it to Destiny on skype. [Here's how I imagine he remembered what city it was.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=cities+in+virginia)

So after establishing that she definitely exhists, Destiny wants to get her on skype to talk. Unfortunately, she can't get on skype b/c:

First, XJ9 was on his smurf skype account... [what even is that??](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1MGnHrn2BM)
Then, she wasn't on b/c she was at the movies...last night???

Then, he wouldn't let her get on b/c he was scared of what she might say or that Destiny and Sheth might make fun of her. [Sheth](http://i.imgur.com/EIa6XAZ) is disappointed, he's nice to everybody!!

Then, he said that she couldn't come on b/c they were having a [""private talk.""](http://i.imgur.com/2NpgrOX)

Finally, he really totally would have let her come on, but she unfortunately couldn't b/c she had to visit her [grandma](http://i.imgur.com/DZub4Fk)

Thankfully, Destiny dropped the girlfriend thing after letting XJ9 know what a great excuse that was. I was just relieved that I didn't have to listen to his squealing and fumbling around while trying to make shit up.

But something was nagging in the back of my head. I knew I had heard XJ9's story before, but I just couldn't put my finger on it. Then, at 3am it hit me...XJ9....IS.... [Manti Te'o!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/bEJAurg)

It's such a genius ploy. He figures that people who watch league of legends wouldn't also follow college football, so he could use the same ruse twice and nobody would know. 

But I'm on to him, and I know what's going to happen next, and unfortunately, the future doesn't bode well for XJ9's girlfriend. Expect the front page to look something like [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/2UIa10w) in a couple of weeks.

Here's the link of who Manti Te'o is and what he did for those of you who would have fallen for XJ9's plot:

I wrote it because I thought with you having been removed from Root, you might need some encouragement. I have come back to offer you similar words.

I woke up in the mid-afternoon a few days ago, as I normally do, and before getting dressed for work, I decided to check Reddit. I saw you had posted in your subreddit with an update, which I read. You detailed your loss of passion for SC2, how you gave up music and your job at the casino, a job you had previously decided to rely on after leaving school. Being pressed for time, I hurriedly threw myself together and got in my car to drive to the restaurant, where I bus tables.

While I was listening to music, a song came on. It's called ""Two Moons"" by Toe. I first heard this song while watching you play SC2 on the remembertomorrow0 YouTube channel. Immediately, I understood everything that you said in your update. I have identified as a writer for the past 10 years, having written more pages than I can remember over that time, from love poetry to short stories featuring a serial killer protagonist. While I still consider myself highly skilled, the realization overwhelmed me so quickly that I almost felt panicked, as a person would feel when seeing a spider.

I will never be a published writer. I have spent the past 10 years perfecting a talent that has amounted to little more than a conversation piece, something to set myself apart from everyone else, especially in the realm of romance. My passion had been dwindling. All at once, my future became uncertain, muddled by the daily happenings of my current life, and I wasn't able to hold onto anything. The only thing I ever held onto disappeared. I am not in school. I do not have a girlfriend anymore. My brother just recently had a mental collapse, resulting in severely damaged sanity. After having grown throughout my years, being praised for my artistic brilliance, my resounding academic success, and my other various accomplishments, it became clear that I could not achieve what I slaved to achieve, and that I am a disappointment.

I say all this because I want you to know that I understand what you must be feeling. I'd imagine that it is similar in some way. But please know, Steven, that I did not become a fan because of SC2.

I did not become a fan because of the four brofestor hit squad.

I did not become a fan because of the baneling analogy.

I did not become a fan because of the camfields.

I became a fan because I relate to you. I became a fan because you do not mince words. I became a fan because you are a real person. When I watch your stream, regardless of the game, you say what you feel and what you think. You are not afraid of the legions of insecure haters that work so tirelessly to strip you of your team, of your sponsors, of your hard-earned success. You are not afraid almost to a fault. You are a normal person, with a vibrant personality.

While SC2 is my favorite game and I hope your passion for it is one day revived, I will not stop supporting you, regardless of your choice. I am a fan of Destiny the man, not Destiny the SC2 player. Whatever you pursue, I know you will find success. If you need more encouragement, I am sure the many other people in this subreddit share my sentiment. Thank you for being you. Good luck.

Sincerely,

Daniel",,False,self,t5_2qnvz,1351512669.0,,,True,t3_1297jk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1297jk/destiny_in_response_to_your_whats_been_going_on/,

What if a chat aspired to something greater?,NeoDestiny,118,24,150,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1fs1pw/what_if_a_chat_dreamed_of_becoming_something/,"What are some things you'd want to see in a new chat room? Imagine that the sky is the limit, and you could see any conceivable feature made?

Please don't waste time suggesting stupid shit etc...I know we all love to troll, but I'm trying to build a realistic feature set. Here's what I have so far -

- I want accounts to be tied in with the accounts on my website. If someone is subscribed to me via my website, and their account is flagged as such, the chat should recognize that.

- I want there to be different ""user levels"", ones that aren't necessarily ""tiered"" (ie: level 5 has all of the abilities of level 4-1, etc...etc...is an example of what I DON'T want) so I could have, say, ""VIPs"" like people who are famous like Vman or Fatefalls or whatever, and ""Subscribers"" for subs, ""Admins"" for admins like me or Nathan (in case he wants to mod hehehe), ""Moderators"" etc...pretty simple, so basically the idea to create different classes of issues recognized by the chat

- Would be nice to have different rooms

- Would be nice to have the ability to PM/whisper someone. I feel like this feature is desperately lacking in the current chat system

- Would be nice to make aliases or what not for people to type in to have a symbol come out (ie: Kappa, FrankerZ, etc)

- Would be nice to give flair to account names (ie for subs and what not)

- Ability for people to select the color of their username, and MAYBE for text?

- Windows ""freezes"" when you scroll; chat will no longer scroll while you have the bar at any position besides the bottom of the window

- Ability to set how many lines you wish to have loaded of the chat at once (can have it so it only stores 10, 100, 1000, 10,000 lines)

- Website will log all text, make it accessible to be read

- Ability to ignore/highlight the chat from users if you wish

- If someone mentions a user, the name is highlighted/turned into a different color; if someone mentions your name, it turns a specific color

- Ability to filter text

- ""Always on top"" setting so chat will sit on top of full screened stream

- Bookmarking of current VOD so you can come back and watch later, or share it with other people

- Polls in chat, real-time updating graph

- Chat metrics!

- Ability to play back chat with VOD?

- Friends list

- An FAQ Bot. Make a Bot that will immidiatley answer frequently asked questions like ""What leauge is this guy?"" ""Whats the song?"" ""Who is he playing with"" ""When will he start/stop steaming"" etc...",,False,self,t5_2qnvz,1370549878.0,,,True,t3_1fs1pw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1fs1pw/what_if_a_chat_dreamed_of_becoming_something/,

So my question is, why not now?

He already knows how most champs work (or at least has a general understanding of what they do) so that wouldn't be much of an issue, and he already has very good mechanics as a side effect of playing so much ADC. The main thing he would have an issue with is lane matchups and knowing when to roam and when to push, something that can be learned through just grinding games. Not only that, but he would likely see a rise in viewership from playing a more ""exciting"" role and he would enjoy playing the game more in general. I notice one thing he complains a lot about is his top/mid lane die a lot but if were to switch to be a jungle main or a mid main he could literally win other people's lanes for them if they fall behind.

If he likes it enough to, he will be able to get in the streaming scene easily too since there aren't too many established streamers yet. 

The timing is very good. The game is going to be getting much bigger soon, so just the time is just ripe. You'll have plenty of people to teach you too, since a lot of the MoW house plays it.

I haven't had so much fun on your stream in a while and it would be great if you could play more mid. In my opinion, midlane is a lot more fun to watch than adc. I don't care if its on a smurf, but always watching you play adc gets boring. I hope you can take this into consideration and maybe leave a reply with what you think.

Im not sure about this but I think midlane players average more viewers as well. Xpeke, Scarra, PL, Froggen, Ocelote usually have much more viewers than Robertxlee, hiimgosu, cop etc. Turtle seems to be one of the only ones with a really high viewership as an adc. This probably has to do more with personality than role though, I have no idea, but its just something I've noticed.

I would love to hear you guys(and Destiny's) opinion on this. Would you guys like to see Destiny play some more mid champions as well or do you rather see him play adc?

Here's what's in my head right now in terms of subscribers and the whole ""tier"" thing -

Tier 1 subscribers - It's $5/month (with $2 being billed every 3 months, instead of $5) or $12/3 months (to sync up with the fantasy league AND HOLY FUCK YOU'RE SAVING $3 WHAT A FUCKING BARGAIN OH MY GOD) in order to be a tier 1 subscriber. Basically you get everything you did before on twitch, which means you get a cute little icon for chat, and you get to talk when I'm in rage-mode and I put the subs only mode on. + I'll unban you if I rage ban you (RIP Dogspound or whatever sub I temp-banned yesterday).

Tier 2 subs are priced X2 of the previous entry. These are the subs that I'll enter into drawings and shit for the weekly ARAMs (HOLY FUCK). Every Sunday I'll put aside some time (still debating how much) to play ARAMs or normals with my tier 2 subs. I could probably do other stuff, too, but that's where I need your ideas.

What would motivate you to become a tier 1 subscriber, and what would motivate you to become a tier 2 subscriber?

Also, any pros/cons/feedback etc.. much appreciated.

Current shit I wouldn't mind doing:

Become a variety gaming channel!",FilliamHMuffman,69,13,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/13ewjd/no_butthurt_over_lol_here_just_a_longwinded/,"Hey Destiny, been watching for a while now. Probably at least...21 months maybe? I remember finding you on twitch, I remember the day your first got GM in SC2, the 4 fester hit squad and all that.

First of all, congrats for going back to twitch, own3d was not my cup of tea, but I still followed you there. Shame on them for not paying you (if that is the correct reason).

So anyway, you have made a semi-temp switch to LoL and I personally  am fine with it. Not going to lie, I would prefer SC2 to LoL, but I have always had your stream on in the background while I do homework and browse the internet. Whether you play LoL or SC2 doesn't mater much to me. But what does matter, is hearing and seeing Destiny having fun.

I don't speak for anyone else, but for me personally I like to watch steams because I get to live vicariously through the streamer who is having fun playing games while I am stuck doing boring maths and such. Professional gamers who like to be competitive are not different for me. I don't watch Idra because it's obvious he hates what he is doing, and the only reason he probably gets viewers is because people want to see him rage and bm all day.

So to get the point. I feel like it would be a better experience for both you and your fans if instead of being a competitive gamer focusing on LoL, you became a variety gaming channel and just had fun playing different games. DayZ with JP was the most fun I had watching a livestream in a looooooooong time.

Now why would you want to stop focusing on being the best you can at LoL? I know you are a naturally competitive person, you have said so yourself in other threads. Well the livestreaming business is cutthroat, you have given advice on how to make your stream stand out from the dozens of others out there. Actively trying to grow a channel, a brand, is extremely difficult but extremely rewarding. 

Try to think of the biggest variety gaming personality, most people would probably think of Totalbiscuit. Why is TB popular? Mostly because he speaks his mind and doesn't muddle words. But TB isn't the final word on things and he shouldn't just because he is extremely popular. There is still a vacuum in the market, a need for diversity, a second opinion, for all the fans TB has, he also has many to dissent and don't care for him. 

This is is all half assed when it comes to explaining the reasoning, and clarifying my points. But then again, these are all probably things you have heard before. Bottom line is, I think your personally lends itself to something better than focusing on 1 game. I will still turn on your stream and watch you play LoL, but I think it would be beneficial to your pocketbook and your sanity to just go and have fun. Thanks for reading this.",,False,self,t5_2qnvz,False,,,True,t3_13ewjd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/13ewjd/no_butthurt_over_lol_here_just_a_longwinded/,

But he is only using about 50% of his capabilities. So here are a few things to get all that dmg out with Draven: 

How to catch axes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf-t2iNIvM4

Skill Order: R &gt; Q &gt; W &gt; E. 

Levels: lvl 1: Q, lvl 2: W, lvl 3: Q, lvl 4: E

Catching axes will refresh his W!!!! 

Draven can spam his W all the time in fights for the steroid and if you want to chase after someone. It is basically impossible to run away from Draven, because he can always catch the axes in front of him. Good Draven players can even do that with two axes at the same time. That gives him infinite speed and infinite damage.

TL;DR: The true power of Draven comes from his W.

I bought it and would play time to time with my friend's as a casual bronze player. I was in bronze league, we all know how bronze league is. It makes you feel insignificant, inferior and just dirty, to you everything is OP in that league and there's nothing you can do about it. Starcraft 2 just wasnt fun for me at all. I never played customs, I would just casually play 2v2, 3v3's and 4v4's with my friends and doing stupid things like massing void rays or banelings. Then I saw your ""Destiny in a Nutshell"" video. I was like who the fuck is this guy? He's hilarious. I watched your stream and it was amazing. It was fun, your BM was witty and I could feel your passion. Your passion drove me to learn more and to be the best that i could. Your lessons lead me to cool duded like Catz and Minigun, I tahnk them as well, but you were the catalyst. I am now a Platinum player, top of my league and on my way to Diamond. Yeah i'm still not the best. But the only reason i still played ladder and stuck with the grind was because I wanted to be like you. I wanted to be the zerg player with the quirky build, amazing infestor control, random spontaneous ideas. Sure I may never go beyond my league, i'm still a lower end player but you made the game for me. Through college all I had was my computer and internet, you were one of my only sources of entertainment and to see you in this slump depresses me. Yes the game has flaws I see that now, Blizzard caters to much to a certain audience and I can see the facade a lot of people put on due to money. But guess what? I give 0 fucks about them. Absolutely 0. What made this game good for me was learning and being entertained by you. I think LoL is a terrible game, it's popular because it caters to casuals, in my eyes it's the PC's Call of Duty franchise, I've given it a try and i'm not a fan of the MOBA style type of game. Seeing you reduced to playing LoL and raging, not even BMing crushes me because it still isn't the Destiny that inspired me to play. Inspired me to voice my own opinions in life. And finally taught me not to give a fuck what people think if i'm passionate about it. Find your passion again bro, just please don't let it be LoL because it's the mainstream thing. Find what will rebuild your happiness. Face your Destiny.

Yeah, im sorry for that end part. In all seriousness though, this is why you inspired me, i'm sure many below have a similar story. We are here to pick you up, just have fun again. Epic brofist'splosion.

1362510817.0,46,self.Destiny,19q1fl,How not to get into the Tribunal ~ Destiny,Tigam,72,26,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/19q1fl/how_not_to_get_into_the_tribunal_destiny/,"First time I've ever posed on Reddit... But I didn't see an email so I'm posting it here D...  Because damnit I like LoL...  I like watching you play LoL...  I even love it when you rage... ON FUCKING LINE.  Where they can't ban you.

How NOT to get reported and banned...  This is what this is about.   There are of course a great many things that can get you reported and banned... But I""m going to address the ones that are, or should be, obvious.  Because quite frankly getting enough reports to get into the tribunal is pretty easy... Especially when you are a well known streamer.

Now I'm a top 250 judge.  Which is a bullshit title really but out of the 1.8k cases done these are no bullshit.

**First rule:**

Never, and I mean never fucking tell someone you are going to report them.  They majority of the time they report you back.  Congrats... Now instead of one person one more step on the way to the tribunal there are two.  YOU, and the guy you want to report.  

Never, and I mean never fucking ASK for anyone else to report them.  Same fucking reason.   Don't use it as a threat.  Don't say a god damn thing about reporting anyone.  Don't say you will report someone.  Don't be a fucking retard.

**Second rule:**

Never...  Absolutely never use racial or sexual orientation slurs.  These are insta punish votes in the tribunal.

Nigger, Faggot, or any variation there of is insta punish.  If they report you after you used this in a game... You're fucked if you get into the tribunal.  Just don't fucking use them.

It's also not a great idea to use sexual organ slurs.  Pussy, cunt, dick...  Of course those are usually accompanied by the sexual orientation slurs... so.. *shrugs*

**Third Rule**:

Don't tell someone they are bad.  I don't give a shit if they are bad.  Don't say they are feeders, stupid, noobs, retards, or anything derogatory and hang on it all game... Hell... If your name is the only one on 8 lines of text to become a ""block"" of negativity...  Chances are you fucked.  DON'T FUCKING DO THAT.

**In general**

The tribunal judges really only do one thing.  They look to see if what you are saying was *trying* to piss off someone.   Cussing doesn't get you banned. As long as you aren't spamming fuck, shit, motherfucker, or whatever...  Nobody really cares.  Or at least the majority of judges don't care.

**Read this D, follow it...  Please god don't get perma banned before they install you just can't chat when you get reported.**

I lost steam attempting the second verse...I don't think I'll do the whole song but the last verse is definitely worth giving a shot.

*my dew's gone warm, i'm wondering why i haven't gone to bed* 

*the grey dawn light comes through my window, i can hear sweet slumber's call*

*even if i slept, i would dream of you, watchin' you brave solo-LoL*

*now i'm laughing, cuz you're so damn mad, you're so damn mad*

dear steve, i emailed you but you ain't respondin'

i left my twitter and my sc2 handle at the bottom

i sent two friend requests back in autumn, you must not've got em

there probably was a problem with battle.net or somethin

sometimes i make typos when i'm blazing pot &amp; real numb

but anyways, fuck it, what's been up man, how fed's nathan?

my girlfriend don't exist, i'll pro'bly never be a father

if i have a daughter, guess what i'ma call her, i'ma name her jimmy

i read about your LoL ranking too, i'm sorry

i had a friend ragequit over some bitch who couldn't support him

i know you probably hear this every day, but hhhehehehehe

i even got your T2 sub, that shit's a straight up scam

i got a room full of your may-may's and your pictures, man

i like the shit you did with minigun, that shit was phat

anyways, i hope you get this man, hit me back

just to chat, truly yours, ratz stay ratz, pls #callcatz
 
---


&gt;EDIT: Here's the last verse from ""Stan's"" perspective (I like the idea of it being from falcontard). I might do the the final verse as well, which would be from Destiny's perspective.

dear mr. ""I'm-too-good-to-play-a-dying-game""

this'll be the last time i ever watch your stream

it's been a day and still no word, i don't deserve it?

i know you got my last email and marked it ""read""; i hacked your shit

so this is my screencast i'm sending you, i hope you see it

i'm in a basement, playing ladder on korea

hey steve, i just smoked a pound of weed, you dare me to cheese?

you know the song by eminem about a guy named stan?

about how marshall coulda saved his biggest fan from drowning

but didn't, and stan killed himself, then slim made a song about him

that's kinda how this is, 'cept i'm not fuckin round with drowning

plus it's too late, i'm blazed and my mom won't let me have her car key

and all i wanted was a coaching session or a call

i hope you know i ripped all of your may-may's off the wall

i loved you steve, we coulda trolled together, think about it

you ruined it now, i hope you can't carry and you feed cuz of it

and when you feed, i hope you can't win and you rage about it

i hope your ELO eats at you and you can't breathe without me

see steve, shut up bitch, i'm tryna talk

hey steve, that's my gf screaming in my bed

but i didn't ask her out, i just tied her up, see, i ain't like you

cause if she'd answered ""no"" i'd suffer more and pro'bly cry too

well, gotta go, i think i've found a match now

oh shit, my temps, my rig can't play and stream this shit out

The primary problem is that I feel like there's only so much stuff I can talk about/get asked about, and it got to the point to where even really dumb/trolly questions were being upvoted to the top since there was nothing really to talk about. I did about 150 questions over 30 Monday Mails so far, right? Can I really do another 52 weeks of it?

I've also wanted to figure out a different way to organize how questions are brought in, ie: make it a sub-exclusive feature or even just answer questions that come in with a $10 donation or something (some kind of way to reward/give an incentive to people who give me that cold killa cash 420).

I've also always wanted to do more show-type stuff, but I can't ever think of starting one. Every time I think about what I'd want to do, I get lost because I'm not sure what I'd want the topic to be, or even what I'd want the format of the show to be.

He actually literally believes this stuff. Again my question here is to Destiny: why are you allowing this on stream?

So I was surprised to find that Deezer is apparently a relatively well known LoL player (under the name 1Goal 1Dream).  I remember hearing he switched awhile ago, but not that he was good enough to play on an actual team.

People like Diamond and Sasquatch (both known well in the SC2 community) discuss the topic and don't seem to hesitate suggesting it is him, so I guess it is well known.  Also LoL players Pobelter and Ecco say that it is Deezer.

What is everyone's thoughts on this?  It's crazy to see they would pick up a player like him.  Maybe they don't know his background, especially since they are asking people to donate to him.  I never thought Deezer would be on a LoL team while Destiny wouldn't be.

Sorry if it is off topic here, but I feel it is pretty relevant since I'm sure many people here know who Deezer is and have a unique perspective on him.",,False,self,t5_2qnvz,False,,,True,t3_1bz8wj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1bz8wj/deezer_joins_velocity_esports_xpost_lol/,

The Gods in the LOTR universe are called Ainur. They have Maiar (spirits from before the world was created) to help them with the world. 

The Maiar include Gandalf, Sauron, Saruman, and all the other wizards and are said to be numerous. Maiar are literally as old as creation.

Balrogs, the great beasts of shadow and flame are also Maiar, corrupted Maiar. 

The Ring did the same thing that the rings given to all of the mortals and elves and the like did: it enhanced the wielders powers. It was intended to control all of the other created rings though.

A simple creature turns invisible, they have no inherent strength or power. A more powerful creature, such as a Maia, would be almost invincible.

~~1) Unable to mute commercials after the first one  (comment: *oleg says it's been fixed [here](http://en.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/mzqkn/lets_organize_complaints_so_that_destiny_knows/c36eacn))*~~ - The issue has been fixed BUT for the second/third commercials you have to unmute and mute again for it to work

~~2) Stream unmutes itself after commercial (comment: *very very serious issue, too many people watch during the night or at work etc*)~~ Fixed for people who do get commercials (see 4th issue on medium priority)

3) Own3d needs a mobile app.


**medium:**

1) No resolution options on VODs (comment: *will be added in q1 2012 according to oleg: [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/mzqkn/lets_organize_complaints_so_that_destiny_knows/c355lbp)*)

~~2) No 240p option on live stream.~~ Added according to oleg: [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/mzqkn/lets_organize_complaints_so_that_destiny_knows/c355lbp)

3) Default chat is pretty horrible. 

4) Muted stream auto-unmutes after a commercial, if the viewer doesn't get any in his country. 


**minor:** 

1) Horizontal volume control is better than vertical. (comment: *i don't think there is any media player that has it vertical by default. Even youtube tried vertical for a while. Horizontal is simply better.*)

2) Fading UI on non-fullscreen mode is annoying (comment: *it's nice for exactly 10 minutes, then you just want to get shit done as quickly as possible*)

3) Volume resets at ~20% everytime you refresh a stream.

4) No pop-out feature on VODs

I've been following Destiny for a long, long time now. I really enjoy his stream and he's really the only guy I watch on a consistent basis. I know there are a bunch of reasons why Destiny stopped playing SC2 and there are a bunch of reasons why Destiny started playing LoL and the two aren't necessarily related, but I'm just wondering about this: 





What were Destiny's viewer counts during the ""peak"" of his SC2 phase and what are they now? I know numbers don't necessarily mean much, and again, I promise, promise this isn't a troll post and I'm not trying to incite anything, but I'm interested because it seems like a common argument I see in the Twitch chat is that Destiny started playing LoL because he gets more viewers (again, not necessarily true, just something that's said often.) Maybe it's just the nature of the communities, but from a purely anecdotal perspective it seems like Destiny was more ""popular"" in general with the SC2 community than he is with the LoL community. I rarely see him mentioned in r/leagueoflegends where as in r/starcraft he was a pretty frequent topic of discussion. 




I know there are a TON of factors at play, including the difference in subreddit size, the nature of the communities themselves, the age of the communities and the games, as well as other things like Destiny streaming on OWN3D and stuff, but to me it seems like he was much better known in the Starcraft community and had a better chance of ""making it"" there (whatever that means.)

**10m bans** include:

* Non mod-sanctioned polls.
* Colorwhoring (You can still use it, but only for its intended purpose.)
* Facespam.

**1m bans** are given to similar text. Similarity % is based on this paper: http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/0112.6022 The bot stores text longer than 50ish letters for 30ish lines and then 1m bans lines 70%+ greater to it. (*I'm considering alternate text comparison algorithms. Suggestions are welcome.*)

The ""self spam"" works on a similar principle, but it only whacks when you repeat yourself ***three*** times. However, it has no such 50ish letter limit. Bot remembers your past 5ish lines.

1m bans are also rewarded to superlong google search links.

**Not all** bans are described. For example, specific users have longer tempbans due to repeated antics. However, this covers ~95% of the bans.

v7.0.1's code with many sensitive parts removed: http://pastebin.com/jwPAUVpS

When it expires in 30 days, ping me and I'll update it with more recent code.

I don't code for clarity, I code for brevity, which is not the Pythonic way. Anyway, no one else was really intended to read the code, hence the lack of comments and use of fantastically long lines like

    message(""No song played/scrobbled. Played "" + tdformat(int((datetime.datetime.utcnow() - datetime.datetime.strptime(psong[0].playback_date, '%d %b %Y, %H:%M')).total_seconds())) + ' ago: ' + psong[0].track.get_artist().get_name() + ' - ' + psong[0].track.get_title())

Why do I code like this? My reasoning is that when I'm done with a line of code, it should take up as little space as possible, since I (hopefully) will never have to examine it again.

He could read and send messages as the other user so this wasn't just a display bug like @TwitchTVSupport twitter account has been claiming. Another comment from the blog was able to time out others from a non moderator account...

The Story of Steven and Irishladdie

By: Philip K. Dickhead

Chapter 1:

It was some time after the formation of the Pan-American Fempire^1 that Steven found what appeared to be a vagrant at his doorstep. The bedraggled man stood before Steven with disheveled hair and worn clothing. The bags under his eyes seemed to suggest that he had not slept recently and repugnant odor that hung about his clothes made it apparent that if he had, it had been in an alley. 

Somehow, Steven had the feeling that this would be a bad day. 

Steven stepped out of his house letting the screen door swing shut behind him. Autumn leaves rustled gently in the breeze, occasionally falling onto the lawn before being lazily blown into the road and collecting in the numerous potholes. Across the street tattered propaganda posters were plastered to the chipped paint of a fence. One featured a shadowy female visage and a caption that read, “Big Sister Is Watching!” Another showed a woman styled after Rosie the Riveter, swinging a hammer downward at an anvil labeled “Patriarchy” as the women said, “Ours shall be the blow that strikes at oppression!” Somewhere in the distance a stray dogs barked incessantly. 

“Can I help you?” Steven asked with measured hesitation. 

“God,” said the man in a friendly, familiar manner, “I expect you can’t recognize me like this. I’m Irishladdie. We used to converse while you were streaming.” 

“Really?” said Steven, somewhat amused by the absurd situation in which he found himself, but also confused as to how someone like Irishladdie could be standing before him in such a condition. As it turned out, a liberal arts degree in women's studies was just as useless^2 under the new regime as it had been previously, leaving Irishladdie without employment. 

Life was not easy for Steven either. Living under the iron grip of the Fempire’s unshaven vulva was expensive for white, heterosexual males, and every bit of extra money that Steven could scrape together was spent feeding Nathan. The outlook for his family was so bleak that Steven was forced to stop trolling his stream viewers about being Catholic in order to avoid the additional taxes for being Christian. Even though he could scarcely afford another mouth to feed, Steven could not but help take pity on the poor man and invited Irishladdie into his home. 

The Fempire had come to power by promising to elevate those individuals who had felt disenfranchised under previous governments. All that it had actually managed to do was to reduce everyone to that level. They were all equals now, but some were less equal than others. If you wanted a picture of the future, imagine a boob mashing against a human face—forever. 

The world had decayed to the point that as Steven invited Irish into his home and went to kitchen to get him a meal, he overheard a news report on the television about the breaking verdict in a recent, high-profile court case. The not guilty verdict for the man, who had burned down an entire orphanage, killing over fifty newborn infants, would have shocked Steven at one point, but such news no longer fazed him; at least not since they had convicted him of killing his ex-wife.

Steven would have mused further on the sordid state of affairs, but the abrupt beeps from the microwave interrupted his thoughts. 

Steven brought the reheated leftovers into the living room, where Irishladdie was sitting on the couch. Steven handed him the plate, which he accepted graciously and attacked the food with a vigor that he often accused men of using to oppress women and minorities. After shoveling the last of the food into his mouth, Irishladdie returned the plate to Steven, who brought it back to the kitchen. As he placed it into the sink, he heard the familiar sound of the screen slamming shut, announcing the arrival of his son, Nathan. 

“How was school today, little buddy,” Steven said, greeting his son. 

“Bad,” replied Nathan, as he shrugged off his backpack and set it on the floor. “We had to spend all morning learning about stupid Joan of Patriarchy and then in the afternoon the teacher made Rashad yell at me for fifteen whole minutes to ‘show me how it felt’ or something like that.” 

Steven mussed his son’s hair as he embraced him. “Don’t worry about that too much,” he told his son. “Just try to stay out of trouble.” 

“Okay,” Nathan replied dejectedly as he turned to head off to his room. He paused suddenly, turned and asked, “Dad what’s a rapist? Jenny told me that she learned that all boys were rapists.”

Steven sighed. How could he even begin explaining rape to a young child who still had no real interest in or understanding of sex? “It’s nothing,” he said. 

“What are they teaching in schools these days?” he wondered aloud as Nathan ran off.  

“Obviously important facts,” said Irishladdie who had entered the kitchen just moments before. “It’s important for kids to learn about privilege, oppression, and other—“ he continued, but Steven had already stopped listening as he wondered just what he had gotten himself into and how long he would be able to bear it. 

---

1 Although the official dictionary entry for the Fempire defined it as a combination of the words female (although it was not spelled that way in order to avoid triggering those individuals who had suffered under the Patriarchy.) and empire, a more apt description would have been a combination of female and vampire. All that it had done was manage to suck the life blood from its constituent countries or anyone who interacted with it.

2 It was quite useless as the particular paper and inks used made it unsuitable for use as bathroom tissue and almost impossible to burn. No one had yet thought to try eating it, but it’s unlikely that it would do any good as its nutritional value was that of its value in all other regards: none.

I started to select the best songs of my music collection and put them into a spotify playlist a few weeks ago. Sadly many artists aren't yet available on Spotify, but I'll try to keep up with their updates. So expect the playlist to steadily grow.

Every Artist is unique in this playlist (besides 2 or 3 tracks, which were just too awesome to not put them in there), so there is lot of room for you to find new artists.

The playlist doesn't include the progressive, ""post-rokish"" kind of metal Destiny also listens to (Between The Buried And Me, Pain Of Salvation, Emery etc.) - which I, by the way, also like, but I wanted to keep the character of the playlist. 
I'd guess that 50% of it are japanese Artists/Bands.

Sadly I have no alternative version of this Playlist. Maybe in the future I'll try to make a YouTube Playlist out of it.
Grooveshark is impossible for me due to it being blocked in Germany. It would be awesome if someone could copy the playlist to grooveshark, to make it more widely available!

1364059077.0,29,self.Destiny,1av7mp,Isnt Destiny kinda shooting himself in the foot with this joke of schedule?,HellNova,71,42,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1av7mp/isnt_destiny_kinda_shooting_himself_in_the_foot/,"Incase you don’t know what I’m talking about: http://www.destiny.gg/schedule

My problems with the schedule:

1)	He doesn’t start streaming when the schedule says he will.

2)	He does not always switch to HotS (ex. the other day because his ‘jimmies were rustled’) 

3)	Sometimes (yesterday) he did not start streaming games at all till night because he wanted to build that computer. (Which he could have waited a day to do because on Saturday he didn’t have any scheduled things to do.)


Now I know I sound really mad right?  Not really.  I didn’t mind it at all before when it was just random streaming times and he would switch games whenever.  

The problem now is that it is still the EXACT same way, but now we have this joke of a schedule telling us that we should just keep refreshing his page because he’ll be on in #5MIN


Its also very annoying sticking around till the scheduled HotS times just to have him announce 5 minutes before (or not at all) that he had no plans to actually follow the schedule. (which has happened the last two nights) #HowMadAreYouRightNow?

Suggestions?

-Obviously the first suggestion would be to actually follow the schedule, or don’t schedule two weeks in advance when you don’t know what you will be doing on those days.

-ReName it to 'an EXTREMLY loose guideline' which is just for your own personal motivation and not for any actual streaming times. 

-Edit the schedule on the fly when you know you won’t have time / don’t want to play a certain game.  

-tell your stream viewers/twitter followers preferably before the scheduled times that you will not be doing it today so they do not wait around expecting you to do it.  Its no surprise that 'HotS now?' explodes in the twitch chat even on days where he decided he will not play it, because of a lack of effective communication.

Now, back to title, the reason I asked if Destiny was shooting himself in the foot with this schedule is that many people, myself included, would now put no faith in any type of schedule/plan that he would release.  If people aren’t putting stock in announcements he has then, from a business standpoint he is losing viewers that got annoyed and don’t BELIEVE, or even potential viewers, that see this schedule, stick around, and then there’s another no show/be there 2 hours late.

Something that can and may be hard to talk about, unless of course you have strong opinion and much knowledge of what you talk about.

So i did as every other person should before an exam, not study...but to watch Destiny Stream (http://www.own3d.tv/Destiny/live/153518) At this time i was suddenly too lucky for my own good. As Steven suddenly started talking about world problems, oil and Philosophy. Simply because of watching Destiny, with all his knowledge as well as stories/experiments, i was able to do my very best on the Oral exam.
(Turned out, i ACED the test.)

So, This is both a hint and a thanks. To all you guys, if you have anything about Religion or Social Studies then do by all means, watch Destiny's Vlogs/stream.

And a Huge Thanks to Destiny

It was like this for 2 years now. Even in his livestream/ustream days, I couldn't wait to get home to hear his voice &lt;3. The greatest times were had in SC2 and i've completely come to accept his switch to LoL and even more great times will come.

I'm kind of tipsy right now so i'm just rambling on incoherent thoughts but I love this dude and I relaly hope he succeeds in league. If league doesn't work out I hope this dude goes to HOLLYWOOD because he's entertaining as fuck and his personality is so much more awesome than  a lot of these fake fucks in hollywood. Idk what he'd do in hollywood but fuck he should be there

he should be more famous than he is now. Man i miss his stream, i dont want to go to sleep, i want to think about his stream more..

He mentioned a floating div and that it wouldn't work, because it would also cover the control buttons.  Here's one that works:  
  
  
**Step 1: Add HTML**  
In the HTML for your site, there's a div with id ""twitch-elements"", with twitch-player and twitch-chat inside.  In here, add a new div like so:

    &lt;div id=""twitch-elements"" class=""clearfix""&gt;
        &lt;div id=""twitch-overlay""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id=""twitch-player"" class=""twitch-element-wrap pull-left""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id=""twitch-chat"" class=""twitch-element-wrap pull-left""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

**Step 2: Add CSS**  
Somewhere in your CSS, add the following definition:

    #twitch-overlay {
        position: absolute;
        top:0; left: 0;
        height: 447px;
        width: 795px;
    }

**Step 3: Javascript (Optional)**  
Now, if you wanted to, you could add your _own_ click handler to that element via jQuery:

    $(""#twitch-overlay"").on(""click"", function(event){
        // Do something here!
    });

This step is totally optional, and I'm unsure why you'd want to do it, but it does allow you to basically ""rewrite"" what happens when someone clicks on your video.  If you skip this step, then clicking on the video will simply do nothing.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
So, that's it.  There's absolutely **zero** visual indication of this on the page, and it's cross-browser and shouldn't break even in IE (which is notoriously bad for, well, everything).  If you need more details, PM me and I'll lend a hand.  

&amp;nbsp;  

**Edit:** Destiny saw this, and noted that his web developer doesn't like solutions like this, as they seem inelegant.  Unfortunately, because the video and controls are part of the same DOM element (an `&lt;object&gt;` tag), there's no way to directly apply any code to just one part of the player.  The only way is to add an external component, and the `&lt;div&gt;` overlay I used above is the most lightweight solution.  I used Chrome Dev Tools to modify his page while his stream was running, and it worked perfectly.

About two years ago my life was pretty ruff and love towards StarCraft was practically it's only highlight. I was leaving house around 6:00AM, going to work, jumping out to the university, staying late to finish up all of my project at the ad agency, came back to my empty studio apartment around 10-11PM to study, make research, code and write papers - sadly, no time for SC. I don't remember how, but around that time I've stumbled upon Steven's stream (Livestream/Ustream times). I've immediately felt a connection with this guy, who despite pulling crazy shifts, came back home and indulged in zerg infestation. Time difference between US and Europe was timed nearly perfectly, as he usually started streaming around the time I came back home. His stream was constantly running on my second monitor, and his voice filled my room (which i believe kept my sanity intact), while I was going around my uni stuff.

–– Time passed, stuff happened ––

I'm back in school, getting my last credits, and hopefully going to get my masters in Artificial Intelligence (my topic is StarCraft2 related). Some things however stayed the same – it's 4AM, I'm writing a paper and have to get to work in 5 hours. This gave me an idea to revisit Destiny's old streams and bring back some good memories. Sadly, Ustream streaming is very choppy on my current connection, so I've wrote a script to retrieve .flv links and download them on my HDD. If you'd like to do the same, all the links are listed below. GLHF!

**TL;DR:** Destiny helped me survive some hectic times. Thanks bro, I wish you all the best!

In the remainder of this letter, I plan to summarize the contents of that document in an effort to turn Irishladdie's reprehensible canards to our advantage. To get immediately to the point, life isn't fair. We've all known this since the beginning of time, so why is Irishladdie so compelled to complain about situations over which he has no control? That is, is Irishladdie hoping that the readers of this letter won't see the weakness of his argument relative to mine? Irishladdie doesn't want you to know the answer to that question; he wants to ensure you don't pave the way for people of every sex, race, and socioeconomic status to fulfill their own spiritual destiny.

Irishladdie's supporters remain largely silent when asked about the correlative connecting Irishladdie to Jacobinism. The rare times they do deign to comment they invariably skew the issue to prevent people from realizing that you should check out some of the things Irishladdie is saying about Comstockism. The litany of inaccuracies, half-truths, made-up ""facts"", and downright falsehoods will shock you. And I won't even bother mentioning that the main dissensus between me and Irishladdie is that I assert that there is not much demand for independent thinkers in Irishladdie's retinue. He, on the other hand, contends that ebola, AIDS, mad-cow disease, and the hantavirus were intentionally bioengineered by offensive, incoherent thought police for the purpose of population reduction.

I have seen what Irishladdie is capable of, and I am afraid. I am very afraid and I am very angry. Some people say that that isn't sufficient evidence to prove that he is secretly scheming to interfere with a person's work performance, bodily security, physical movement, and privacy rights. And I must agree; one needs much more evidence than that. But the evidence is there for anyone who isn't afraid to look at it. Just look at the way that his premise (that his malisons are good for the environment, human rights, and baby seals) is his morality disguised as pretended neutrality. Irishladdie uses this disguised morality to support his annunciations, thereby making his argument self-refuting.

If Irishladdie's attempts to bring widespread death and degradation to millions of human beings across the face of the Earth have spurred us to establish a supportive—rather than an intimidating—atmosphere for offering public comment, then Irishladdie may have accomplished a useful thing. His idea of vainglorious barbarism is no political belief. It is a fierce and burning gospel of hatred and intolerance, of murder and destruction, and the unloosing of a wrongheaded bloodlust. It is, in every sense, an ophidian and pagan religion that incites its worshippers to an orgulous frenzy and then prompts them to scrap the notion of national sovereignty. Irishladdie frequently accuses his adversaries of causing this country to flounder on the shoals of self-interest, corruption, and chaos. This is yet another example of the growing lack of civility in our civil discourse that ranges from the undiplomatic to the unprincipled and even yellow-bellied. In a more proper debate, one would instead politely point out that my goal is to tackle the multinational death machine that Irishladdie is currently constructing. I might not be successful at achieving that goal, but I honestly do have to try.

Irishladdie possesses no significant intellectual skills whatsoever and has no interest in erudition. Heck, he can't even spell or define ""erudition"", much less achieve it. For years I've been warning people that he plans to give voice, in a totally emotional and non-rational way, to his deep-rooted love of Mohockism. However, that's not my entire message; it's only a part of it. I also want you to know that there is historical precedent for Irishladdie's stratagems. Specifically, for as far back as I can remember, he has been going to great lengths to conceal his true aims and mislead the public. Given how one stentorian activity always leads to another, it should come as no surprise that Irishladdie yields to the mammalian desire to assert individuality by attracting attention. Unfortunately, for Irishladdie, ""attracting attention"" usually implies ""creating a regime of condescending, temerarious narcissism"".

Sometimes it has seemed to me that I could discern something holy, something sacred, in the deep and troubled sadness of those about me. Alas, I discovered that this sadness stems solely from the doleful observation that Irishladdie is like a pigeon. Pigeons are too self-absorbed to care about anyone else. They poo on people they don't like; they poo on people they don't even know. The only real difference between Irishladdie and a pigeon is that Irishladdie intends to trivialize the issue. That's why I am not fooled by Irishladdie's biased and eristic rhetoric. I therefore gladly accept the responsibility of notifying others that I've heard of sanguinolent things like Dadaism and serfism. But I've also heard of things like nonviolence, higher moralities, and treating all beings as ends in and of themselves—ideas that Irishladdie's ignorant, unthinking, doolally brain is too small to understand.

Knowledge and wisdom are Irishladdie's enemies. He understands that by limiting education and enlightenment, he can fool more people into believing that our only chance of saving the planet is to accept unending regulations and straightjacket ""reforms"" from his thralls. Sadly, those with the least education are those who would benefit most from the knowledge that it's easy for armchair philosophers to theorize about Irishladdie and about hypothetical solutions to our Irishladdie problem. It's an entirely more difficult matter, however, when one considers that he doesn't want us to dole out acerbic criticism of Irishladdie and his phalanx of self-aggrandizing goombahs. He would rather we settle for the meatless bone of poststructuralism.

I must ask that Irishladdie's foot soldiers solve our problems over a negotiating table instead of resorting to the battlefield. I know they'll never do that so here's an alternate proposal: They should, at the very least, back off and quit trying to channel the pursuit of scientific knowledge into a narrow band of accepted norms that are based exclusively on his batty insults. If Irishladdie has any children, I recommend that he teach them about love, trust, cooperation, community, reason, negotiation, and compromise rather than violence, paranoia, and fear. He denies that he has been driving us into a state of apoplexy. His denials clearly contradict reports from eyewitnesses who saw him filling the air with recrimination and rancor. I'd like to see Irishladdie spin his way out of that one.

Although I respect Irishladdie's right to free speech just as I respect it for abominable cumber-grounds, hopeless power brokers, and primitive, bad-tempered gutter-dwellers, he should start developing the parts of his brain that have been impaired by Bourbonism. At least then he'll stop trying to depressurize the frail vessel of human hopes. I could accept, perhaps, press releases backed by the forces of logic and powerful reasoning. Orations marked with hypocrisy and contradiction, however, merit none of my respect. Today, we might have let Irishladdie launch a salvo of brainless shell games against the somber, oppressed masses. Tomorrow, we won't. Instead, we will shatter the adage that Irishladdie can be trusted to judge the rest of the world from a unique perch of pure wisdom. If truth, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder, then we might be able to explain away many of his recalcitrant deeds as being merely the effect of bad drugs. Let me try to explain what I mean by that in a single sentence: He is interpersonally exploitative. That is, he takes advantage of others to achieve his own sinful ends. Why does he do that? If I'm not mistaken, there's a painfully simple answer. It regards the way that there's a time to keep silent and a time to speak. There's a time to love and a time to hate. There's a time for war and a time for peace. And, I avouch, there's a time to foster mutual understanding. Or, to put it less poetically, while Irishladdie is out setting up dissident groups and individuals for conspiracy charges and then carrying out searches and seizures on flimsy pretexts, the general public is shouldering the bill. Sadly, this is a bill of shattered minds, broken hearts and homes, depression and all its attendant miseries, and a despondency about Irishladdie's attempts to make our lives miserable.

Imagine if Irishladdie and his oligophrenic associates all tried to one-up each other in a snarky match to see who could use the most disaffected, mad, and downright grotty rhetoric. My neurons would surely cry out in pain if I were ever to lay eyes on such a thing. Such a contest would be almost as painful to endure as the realization that Irishladdie claims to have read somewhere that society is supposed to be lenient towards the worst sorts of licentious litterbugs I've ever seen. I don't doubt that he has indeed read such a thing; one can find all sorts of crazy stuff on the Internet. More reliable sources, however, tend to agree that counterproductive, indelicate present-day robber barons commonly succumb to Irishladdie's distortions, deceptions, and delusions. I do not. Rather, I take pride in looking into the future and considering what will happen if we let Irishladdie fracture family unity. Let me close where I began: I don't know how Irishladdie can be so coprophagous.",,False,self,t5_2qnvz,False,,,True,t3_1awc19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1awc19/fuck_irishladdie/,

What I do want to discuss is what fans expect from Destiny. I've seen a lot of random and pointless hate towards LoL, destiny, and quite frankly that doesn't contribute to anything. I do feel that fans should have a say, and I do believe that destiny reads and considers a lot of things people have to say to him.
I'm going to speak from my point of view, and from what I've seen in your stream chat/this subreddit. With that in mind, I'll start:

A lot of people are disgruntled with your *unofficial* switch from SC2 to LoL, and I'm sure it's not difficult to understand your financial point of view. While people understand, they're still upset. I'm sure people will miss the brofestor squads, or the hilarious BM, or the many things that made Destiny playing SC2 worth watching, but there are a lot of things that people enjoy that aren't mutually exclusive to SC2.


Personally, I enjoy other highlights of your stream just as much as SC2. The Deezer calls, the kyle banter, the combatex parts, your whole series of videos on language was very entertaining, you playing Day Z, crysis etc. All these things don't have to change.

I would very much appreciate seeing all these entertaining things on your stream once again. people believe that because you've quit SC2 you've quit all those things aswell, but I don't believe so. 

People who watch your stream, they might like watching SC2, or LoL, or DayZ etc, but they all like watching Destiny. I find your opinion interesting, and even more interesting the way that you manage to convey it. It made me respect you, it made me want to watch you more.

A good example of this is the Destiny Q&amp;A series. I very much enjoy it, and look forward to more things of the style. 

Perhaps some kind of a discussion panel on a weekly basis? Destiny's Opinion? You've said that you value your opinions/Ideas very much, well I'd like to hear some of them. What are your thoughts about the power of words? how important to you it is to a leader to be able to eloquently get his point across and dominate his Opponent? Do you think people tunnel vision too much into the whole idea of going to college, putting too much emphasis on it? Do you think the whole 9-5 workday the man has constructed himself is counter productive, being a slave to his own kind? etc.

I remember a while ago that you said that you are streaming later than usual lately because you want to sync with Erin's schedule but why haven't you changed your schedule on your website? This is not something that you should ignore since it is stagnating your viewer count.

 Also consider giving a time in which you think you will stream especially sub sunday. As this post is being typed, it is 3:30pm EST and yet no Destiny has appeared on stream. A bit discouraging for someone to consider tier 2 subbing if they will only be able to play an hour or 2 with you.

So after watching his draven and seeing that he is even ""willing"" to support when he doesn't get his preferred role of draven adc, he made a permanent fan out of me and wish to know if this specific thing will help him more if i tune in on his website..

very  small change for me, potentially a lot of money for him if he gets other people to realize he gets more money for viewing him directly.

maybe in his description on twitch he could link his main site*(as im sure he does) but don't be afraid to mention that shit, destiny (in fact: scrolling marquee ought to do just fine.)

 I also thought that you should hype up your services a bit more: You mentioned you would build rigs for people..( I bet you would be surprised at how much people would pay to see you do random shit)..

maybe you can get some raffles going on or some shit too.  it would drive up your popularity maybe.. try to market yourself with free giveaways you get from sponsors.. you dont need the extra shit anyway.

The graph he presented it not what is actually going on in the LoL streams, and I will try my best to explain it.

*When you click on Twitch.tv and you look at LoL vs Sc2, you will see LOL has 3 times, if not more viewers.  However, there are also many more channels competing for those viewers.  Click on LoL and look at the individual streams.  It is not very often that you will see 1 single stream (with the exception of tournaments) that has over 3k viewers.  

*As of the time I am typing this, Wingsofdeath has 14k, and in 2nd place PhantomL0rd has 1.7k.  

*On Ow3nd HotshotGG has 5k, and in 2nd place is Doublelift with 1.7k.  

*With the exception of a few people in LoL (the same can be said about Sc2 with Day9, Idra, etc..) most LoL streamers don't see anywhere near 1-2k.  As a matter of fact, a lot of the streams have only 500 people.  The difference between LoL and Sc2 is LoL = 300+ streams where SC2 has 90+ streams.  

*So even though LoL is getting more viewers, the streamers are actually getting the same amount of viewers (in most cases less) than what Destiny gets.

In order for Destiny to get more viewers than the top players in LoL, he is going to have to come up with something really amazing.  I don't know how he thinks that he will get more viewers than HotshotGG, or the few other top players.  I actually think that he is chasing a dream that is will never turn into reality.  If Destiny wants to stream LoL, than fine.  Do it, if it's what you want to do.  However, please stop making up numbers to try and justify why you are doing this, when the math just does not add up to your statements.

TL;DR: Destiny's numbers are equal to most of the stream numbers in LoL, and it is very unlikely that he will surpass the top pros and also unlikely that he will ever hit over 5k with LoL.  Don't look at LoL vs SC2, look at the individual streams..instead of pointing to the twitch / owned browse page.",,False,self,t5_2qnvz,False,,,True,t3_13lxlo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/13lxlo/why_destinys_graph_is_irrelevant_and_his/,

You tried to address this with a Reddit thread that you posted live on stream, however since you posted it directly to the Twitch chat (heavily biased towards no Raidcall) there was a large amount of crying of #MUTERAIDCALL2013. However, soon after we were discussing within the Raidcall (members chat, not the cesspool that is The Lounge) just what the issues were with Raidcall as it is.

ISSUES:
1)The Lounge as a whole. No restriction on who can access it, anyone can download this free program, make a free account and join this free room. This leaves little barrier of entry to the tryhards and circlejerkers who just want your attention and to be popular on the stream
2)Twitch needs to get over itself. They are always complaining about everything, whether its what your playing in League/SC2, you're talking to much, talking to little, you're wrong, Raidcall is wrong, Raidcall is all autists, etc etc
3)You need to implement the fucking queue when it comes to people asking you questions. It exists for a reason, and it would help so much with the issue of people shouting over each other and ""WHAT WAS THAT I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE 20 OTHER PEOPLE IN HERE"".

Things I did:

* Redid all of the images on rotation.
* Added a fade between the image rotations.
* Removed some of the curves to make it more defined.
* Re-sized it to fit his new UI size.
* Removed the website URL from above the map because it is now on the image rotation and therefore it will look less intrusive/redundant when he is browsing websites or whatever.

**Version 1:** http://i.imgur.com/JG7JiYT.gif

**Version 2:** http://i.imgur.com/RNlcsm9.gif

**edit:** fixed the Twitter.

**edit2:** Added the same black background from the image rotation to the cam spacers for consistency.

If Destiny would like different images for the rotation, for example the CRT league or his Fantasy league he can comment here and I'll add them to it.

The price differences in champions made order of purchases important. It was abundantly clear that Draven was the dude to buy, but it would take a week of saving. 

Behold: price analysis based on play/winrates, including destiny/beebs frequency:
http://i.imgur.com/g0v2OXS.jpg

Then, people started to cheat.
http://i.imgur.com/jxuadgh.jpg

This was still limited to 1 swap per 3 games but you could at least save/gain the points every few games.

Then Ceneza put in the multiplier and fixed cheated and nothing became important except play rate and role.


Heres the best strategy now:

The highest playrate of each champ in each role.

http://imgur.com/KWQI75Z 

Add in the Hafu (Zyra) Destiny(Draven) factor and the team becomes a lot more clear. 

Zyra, Draven, Thresh, Lux.  

Nasus was an ok 5th choice because he is +/- 3% most popular jungledude and could also be top since Hafu plays amumu and xin sometimes. He also only cost 50 points to xin/jarvans infinite.


Overall its a lot more boring. Theres not much thought. Even with Draven getting a huge cut in points due to his play rate, he multiplies every other champions #worth on the same team every game. Play rate is still da best.

How to make it better? Make the correct champion choice much less obvious, but make sure to make it not feel random. I don't like the spamming poll idea because that shits for nerds who got all day to sit and watch u feed on Draven while chat rages about Hafu. 

http://i.imgur.com/IQ9To1r.gif

I think some gradient in champion #worth based on their initial cost should definitely exist. Its fun to progress to a stronger and stronger team as the season goes on. Just make sure da picks don't feel random. 

It would probably be best if u just made it like a real fantasy league. Average out all champions stats over a day/week. Reward points at end of day/week based on performance. Take into account win/loss, KDA, etc.

 To put in an artificial champion #worth gradiant instead of just having it be a crapshoot, you could put in unique abilities on each champion. 

Shitty examples:

Nasus +1 points per tower killed

Draven +1 points per boots purchased

Zyra +2 points per double kill

Its pretty easy to get a general estimate of the worth of these and use it to increase/decrease initial cost of champions.

**TLDR; DO BETTER IF U EXPECT PPL TO GIVE A SHIT, FANTASY LEAGUE SUCKS ALMOST AS MUCH AS UR DRAVEN BUILD**

I have made music for you, you are my driving force that keeps me playing starcraft, my inspiration for me starting to stream and my source of entertainment during the hard parts of my life.

I know that the EG boys did a coup on ITG; which was total bullshit. You are an outspoken member of the starcraft community; which comes with the territory of being trolled by pros and others. You need not to fret sir, the passion you seek to regain can be regained by going back to your roots. (not the team but your old ways.) Get on skype, call your friends, or shit even me, you need to get back into your days of smurfing and lessons - those were the shining moments of your career. 

I think I speak for some of us when I say - we miss you, we support you and don't want to see our favorite fellow go black on the webs or playing LoL.

SC2 matches last from 5 to 50 minutes (not blizzard minutes!), the average match lasting 15 minutes. LoL matches last from 20 to 70 minutes with the average match lasting 40 minutes. With champion selection it is 45 minutes.

This means that an SC2 streamer can play 3 times the amount of commercials a LoL streamer can play, unless the LoL streamer spams commercials between matches (6 or more).

Destiny has the potential of 5k viewers in SC2, 3k is promised if he plays at NA prime time. 9k viewers is the most generous potential I could give him in LoL (if he gets to 1.9k elo, and no big name streamers are online during NA prime time - happens only before big tournaments). His actual LoL viewership potential is around 6k to 7k viewers.

They did tell the community that a controller would work wonders like on the consoles, and so it does.

Having played through it several times, I can say that Dark Souls is a fantastic game and I'm really looking forward to watching Destiny play it, I just think that to play it properly using a keyboard and mouse is just simply not an option, or a very poor one, at most.

&gt;This controls the CRF parameter in x264.

Using a quality of 5 or 6 will make static scenes slightly worse, but in the case of motion, quality will be improved.** Experiment with this depending on your input, for FPS games and other high activity scenes you probably want this lower than 10.

On that fateful day when Destiny rededicated his stream to LoL, he explained to all his fans that he was doing it for economic reasons. I couldn't blame him. Although I would really miss his SC2 gameplay and his commentary, I realized that he needed to support his family. If that meant switching to a game with a larger viewer base, then I would wish him the best of luck. However, when I check his stream on teamliquid, at least when he's actually playing (not building a computer, etc.) he rarely rises above 3000 viewers. Wasn't 3000+ viewers the AVERAGE amount of viewers when he was streaming SC2, as long as big names like IdrA weren't also streaming? He had explained at one point (anyone have the link?) that, if he continued with SC2, his viewership would eventually plateau, whereas switching to LoL would eventually increase monthly stream revenue over time. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that plateau happening now, with LoL? Do any of you have any data regarding the viewership since the switch happened?

Anyways, as Steven has said himself, he enjoys SC2 because of the sense that he is wholly responsible for how the game goes and a variety of other aspects. And HoTS is WAY less stagnant than WoL was towards the end. Could make for an interesting stream. Not to mention more $. PURELY from an economic standpoint, what do you guys think would work best?

Your rant yesterday was interesting, it was late for us in Europe, I just wanted to point small things.

You were right to say that making loans easier would incent students overextend their loans. But, the tuitions and total cost of college should be linked to the expected average starting salary of a new graduate based on how the marked is heading or expected to be by the time the borrower graduates. So less interests rates would make loans easier, it might push some to choose majors that cost more, but it shouldn't push students fees up.

Your worries [that something similar to the mortgage crises might happen] are legit. If the vision we had on how the market would be by the time the borrower graduated, turned out to be wrong. Then loans that were good ones will turn to bad ones. But that is a risk all students have to take.

The only way for them to not end up in this situation is to study hard, and and adapt to new market trends during their studies. I am not sure if this makes sense for Art majors.

Edit: Also you said that defaulting on student loans is impossible. This makes them very safe from the lenders perspective. Then asking for lower interest rates, including reasonable years for paying them back, would push these lenders to give far less money to kids in majors with little perspective compared to other majors. 

Finally classes like the one you described, where students don't work, and graduating only means to go teach music in kindergarten, would disappear on the long term.",,False,self,t5_2qnvz,1376654830.0,,,True,t3_1kh8y5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1kh8y5/about_student_loans_and_lazy_college_students/,

""The keyboard sucks balls. I would never, ever, ever recommend black switches on a mechanicl board. Ever. Just get normal dome switches. There’s literally no other point.""



I am not sure when he says ""Just get normal dome switches"" if he means overall there's no point in MX switches or when it comes to black switches you might as well get dome switches.



**TL;DR**


My questions are: 

-What made him decide to use black switches?

-If he does not like black switches, what is holding him back from getting another keyboard?

-Are blue switches still his most preferred?

-Despite your arguably valid insight on the future of sc2, is there any possibility in your mind that you will you ever pursue sc2 again? :[
