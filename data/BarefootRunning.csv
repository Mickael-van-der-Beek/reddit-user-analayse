As a veteran barefoot/minimalist runner (3.5 years) and bf ultramarathoner, I don't recommend VFFs for anyone.

Don't be fooled by marketing: VFFs *do* significantly alter your mechanics from barefoot. Anyone who's been barefoot for a significant length of time notices immediately how unnatural the toe positioning is. The rubber constrains your movement, and the different thicknesses of rubber puts your whole gait off balance.

Paradoxically, while [*some*] closed-toe minimal shoes don't give your toes as much *range* of motion, they do give your toes much more *freedom* of motion, since the toes don't have to fight the resistance of each individual toe pocket. And the sole is more uniform throughout, so your foot can actually adapt to the ground instead of adapting to the VFF sole pattern. I feel like I'm balancing on top of the VFFs, while closed-toe minimal shoes feel ""flat"" to the ground.

When I've tried on VFFs, I feel like I'm wearing a cast on my 4th and 5th toes. Trying to run in them put immediate strain on the joints and ligaments of those toes. This is an even more unnatural feeling to a true bfer than running in marshmallow shoes.

VFFs have two things in their favor: One, they do look cool. Two, Barefoot Ted wore them in Born to Run. But, here's the kicker: BFT doesn't wear them anymore. Now he only runs in sandals or nothing.

My recommendations for footwear are, in order:

1. Barefoot (when possible).

2. ""Luna sandal"" or ""Invisible Shoe"" style open-toe sandals.

3. A closed-toe minimal shoe like the Merril Gloves or Vivo Barefoot line.

4. Cross-country or road flats (expensive but low durability).

5. Flat-soled ""non-running"" shoes

6. Marshmallow running shoes.

VFFs aren't on there at all.

I have 38D's, and I'm used to doubling up with a bra and a sports bra in order to run (and I've never been a big fan of running due to breast and knee pain). My torso is no longer slamming up and down with every stride, and with this new running technique I feel like I'm gliding, swishing and sashaying across the treadmill, and my boobs are gliding along with me instead of flopping around wildly. I diddn't have to huff and puff to go the same distance as before, too. 

The other thing I've noticed is soreness. While I barely broke a sweat, I definitely felt muscles I've never felt before. I desperately want to hop back on that treadmill and do W1D2, but my shins, calves and the backs of my knees and ankles are SINGING with soreness. I know there is not much I can do but wait it out, but I want to run!! 

I guess I just wanted to share my enthusiasm. I had no idea that going barefoot was the answer for us large-breasted runners (and it certainly wasn't mentioned in BTR).

1331648810.0,47,self.BarefootRunning,qujxe,Friendly reminder: the knowledge that you should land on your forefoot does not imbue you with perfect form,,57,10,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/qujxe/friendly_reminder_the_knowledge_that_you_should/,"I'm hoping this reaches the eyes of some of the newer barefoot style runners. I just started running in the style in December, after I bought some KSOs, and it went quite well for me for a while. Landing on my forefoot was enabling me to run for much longer spans of time than I was previously able.

It seemed to come with its own set of downsides, however - for one, even though I was running for longer, I seemed to be running shorter distances overall. Second, pain eventually developed in my arches, forefoot, and achilles tendon.

The pain got to a point in my achilles tendon where I could feel it in the first 10 strides of a run. It was nothing severe - at most an annoyance and an inconvenience - but it did concern me. I hoped Google would give me an answer, and it did. I read stories of others who had recently adopted the barefoot style and had even torn their achilles tendons. The culprit, it seemed, was landing too far into the forefoot.

I was running almost toe first. My heel would ever so briefly kiss the ground, but my forefoot was doing 100% of the work. Yesterday, I went out for a run, and as usual, within the first 10 strides or so, my achilles tendon started throbbing. Remembering what I had read, I shifted my strike back to just behind the ball of my foot. Careful not to let my foot land completely flat and slap the ground, but also careful to let all of my foot take part in my stride. Still landing on my forefoot, but letting my midfoot and heel do a good deal of work as well.

NEVER before has a change in technique brought about such instant change. When I was extreme forefoot striking I almost felt like I was running in place sometimes; moving my strike back instantly widened my stride and kicked my pace way up. My achilles pain instantly vanished, as did my forefoot and arch pain. 

So, I hope others can benefit from this knowledge - striking with your forefoot is a good first step (hah), but there is technique to be learned beyond that. Don't simply take the knowledge of a forefoot strike out into the world and expect to automatically be injury free for 40 mile runs.",,False,,t5_2rp0r,False,,,True,t3_qujxe,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/qujxe/friendly_reminder_the_knowledge_that_you_should/,

I’m 27, 5’11”, around 170lbs, fairly fit, and have never been above 11% bf in my life. I have always disliked shoes (all shoes trap heat and moisture in a way I find uncomfortable), and I ran barefoot quite often throughout my youth. I’ve also always lived in shoes-off households, so I spent much of every day barefoot even before changing my outside footwear. My previous outside footwear included Chuck Taylors and today’s conventional tennis shoes. 

I changed my shoe preferences two years ago because it fit with my general health philosophy (i.e., evolved mechanics are probably best), not because I was experiencing any kind of pain. Also, I was blessed with an uncanny ability to not give a f**k, which helps when starting out barefoot running, etc. 

In the last two years, I have spent an embarrassing amount of money on minimalist shoes. I have VFFs, vivobarefoots, unshoes, and softstars: i.e., minimalist all-stars. 

**My story**
The exact timeline is fuzzy because it’s been a while. TLDR; **SEE THE TITLE**

Relatively soon after I changed my shoe preferences, my problems began. The first thing was plantar fasciitis in the left mid-foot. It was mild at first, but gradually got to the point where every step was painful. I figured too-much-too-soon, switched back to regular shoes until it went away, and eased back into minimalist shoes/barefoot . That took about 2 months, but once I finished the slow transition, the PF didn’t come back, so I was pleased. 

Sometime later, I noticed calluses building up in my right forefoot. This didn’t bother me for the first 4 months, but after a while, I noticed the underlying bone was very sore. This blossomed into metatarsalgia, and my arches started to fall. It seemed like what I was experiencing matched up with [Morton’s foot-type issues](http://www.triggerpointbook.com/mortons.htm), so I tried implementing a Morton’s pad into my shoes. 

This didn’t really do anything, so I went to a podiatrist for the first time. He wanted me to wear $400 orthotics. My response: “LOL NO. Barefoot, barefoot, etc.,” so nothing came of this visit. 

By this point, every step I took with my right foot was painful; my second metatarsal had “dropped,” and it was like walking on a stone. Running was completely out of the question, and I just wanted some relief. I tried [fancy insoles](http://www.mortonsfoot.com/metatarsalgia.html) for a month or so, and those did nothing. My plantar fasciitis came back in my left foot, and I started having top-of-the-foot pain. The latter developed into a visible bump as the tendon over that metatarsal became increasingly inflamed. 

I started practicing a number of foot exercises, foam/ball rolling in the hopes that they would help. I still do all of those (because, hey, who knows), but they didn’t resolve my pain.

This is where I tried [toe-spreaders](https://nwfootankle.com/correct-toes). About 1 year and 6 months into this, I had pain relief for the first time. My plantar fasciitis went away, along with the top-of-the-foot pain. The pain from metatarsalgia greatly decreased, but remained, as did the calluses and the small bump. After easing into them, I wore the toe-spreaders religiously 24-7 in wide shoes for about a month and was thankful for the relief.

Then the metatarsalgia pain started coming back in force, leaving me pretty exasperated. One day in Costco, I saw a pair of arch supports for $9. The brand is Orthera, but I couldn’t find them online. I bought them because I had already spent so much money on shoes and curatives that I figured it didn’t matter. I put them into my VBF Aquas and started wearing them around. Within three days, my feet were completely pain-free. 

It’s now a month later, and I don’t have any calluses, my metatarsal is back in-place, and the bump on top of my foot is gone. 

**Leftovers**
I understand an inevitable criticism here is going to be, “Well, you weren’t actually barefoot all the time.” I think this is pretty weak. Aside from the fact that I would go whole weeks barefoot sometimes, most of the evidence around barefoot running suggests that the form is the most important factor. Indeed, that’s the entire point behind minimalist shoes. If one has to be completely unshod to reap the benefits we tout ‘round these parts, then we should probably stop advising people that VFFs will help them.  *Even the taurahumara wear shoes.*

My own feelings about this experience are pretty complex. I invested a lot both emotionally and economically into BR. I can’t say for sure that switching to “barefoot” caused my problems. After all, it could have been part of aging, etc. Given my relatively young age, overall health, and the sequence of events, I do think it’s more likely than not that the switch did cause my issues.  

I’m sharing this story because I don’t want anyone else to go through what I did. Scientific and anecdotal evidence suggests barefoot is good.  It works for a lot of people. But, if it’s not working for you and you’ve given it a fair shot, I suggest trying something else. After two years, all I care about is that I can walk pain-free and run again. 

For now, I’m going to continue using the arch supports in case the soft tissue hasn’t completely healed yet. I’m hoping I can eventually take the supports out and my feet will be able to function naturally one day.

As I rounded the turn of a trail along the bayou I was confronted by a group of guys that wanted to ""talk with me"". These guys were obviously after something more than a kind conversation, but at the end of a 10 mile run I was not going to be able to fartlek the end of this thing.

I stopped to appease the gentlemen as they began to get in my face. Out of nowhere, one of the guys asked ""what are you doing without shoes here"". At this point I realized that I wasn't in kind company (based on the tone of his voice), so I figured explaining how barefeet offer the most natural style of running for people, even mentioning tribes in Mexico and Kenya that still run barefoot would be the best option. Actually, this is not how what I thought would get me out of the situation, but at that point, I was open to anything.

By this point the men were really confused, and more or less intrigued. So they started asking me if I run like that all the time, and I explained that I don't, but I like to do a good amount to keep all of my muscles in good order.

At that point I gained the upper hand and told them that I had to finish my run and they obliged. I still can't really figure out if they were going to jump me, hit me up for cash, or were just genuinely intrigued by my ""new"" running scheme.

After some serious drought, my region is finally getting some rain (severe thunderstorms every other day). Today, we got hit with a fantastic storm. After working in my unfinished basement (renovating so that it's useful space), I stood on my porch looking out at the rain. Instead of the angry, apocalyptic night storm we've been getting, it was an inspiring, refreshing, joyful rain that seemed to cleanse the earth in a way the other storms hadn't.

The next thing I know, I'm flying across the lawn and down the street barefoot, braless, sweatpant-clad, baby dreads a'bouncing freely, filthy and grinning my face off.

1/2 mile later, I returned and just lay back in the grass, soaking wet and happier than I've felt in weeks.

1316534155.0,35,self.BarefootRunning,klonl,The importance of form (NOT about heel-striking).,Notesurfer,40,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/klonl/the_importance_of_form_not_about_heelstriking/,"Let me give a little background to what I'm about to say. I am a 6' 165 lb (2m, 75 kg) male. I've never been a very 'sporty' type, and although I've never been any heavier than I am now, I've never had the endurance to run a mile. I have hiked several thousand miles over the last ten years, but the combination of anemia and the threat of hereditary heart problems have kept me from really pushing my heart and lungs if I can avoid it.

So, fast-forward to June 2011. I have been trying to build up running endurance for three months, with little success. My initial attempt involved running for 1 minute, then walking for 2, and gradually minimizing walking time while maximizing running time a la couch to 5k. Unfortunately, my endurance generally did not increase at all. My heart will palpitate if pushed too hard; it continued to do so, and so I was forced to limit myself.

Two weeks ago I watched [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=787hU5R79JY) and practiced the 'posture reset' portion of it. Although my cadence is still low (160-170) and my foot strike is somewhat heel-oriented, the 'wheel' analogy and the posture that the man in the video recommends have led me to a running breakthrough. Through more efficient use of energy, I was able to run just over one mile yesterday for the first time in my life, and I did it in VFFs. Previously I couldn't run for more than 1.5-2 minutes without getting dizzy and feeling like my heart was going to jump out of my chest. Yesterday I ran for ten solid minutes. 

I hope this story serves to inspire any of you who started barefoot running for health reasons, or who are restricted by a medical condition: there is more to barefoot running posture than forefoot-striking alone. (-:

We are a minimalistic shoe store that carries VFF, Injinji, Inov-8, Vivo Barefoot, Merrell, New Balance, Saucony and Altra.

I own 2 pairs of VFF's, a Treksport and a KSO. I also own a pair of Newtons, Saucony Kinvaras, and a pair of Brooks that I sent in to a company in Utah and got the sole cut out so it is minimalistic.

Despite having so many minimalistic shoes, and working at a minimalistic shoe store, I do not currently run! When I do though, I run in my VFF's. I know I need to run more but the Las Vegas sun is demotivating. I plan on starting and setting up a team here in Las Vegas that runs races like the Ragnar Relay, Marathons, 5K's and other local races so message me if you live near Vegas and are interested.

I just moved back from Hawaii and just started this job. I know a lot about minimalistic running already but there is still more for me to learn and I am sure that I will learn it here.

This is all anecdotal and I claim no expertise in this subject.

* **Background**: I am a 30-something fit male, average runner (8 minute mile) who always wanted to be a great runner but never could because any runs longer than about 3 miles would result in chronic knee pain associated with IT band aggravation and other various knee and ankle pains.  I tried many traditional remedies to no avail.

* **Starting out**: I heard about min running from a co-worker who is very over-weight but had been showing up to work in spandex and Huarache sandals (quite a sight) claiming he had been running regularly and he was really loving it and was up to 4 miles.  I quizzed him a bit, did some quick research and eventually decided to get some VFFs with the excuse that they might be good for surfing for my upcoming trip to Hawaii.  My first run felt amazing; light feet and I felt like a cat.  I was so excited I ran a mile including some steep trail.  When I got home i knew something was wrong.  I was getting sore FAST.  The next morning I could barely walk.  My calves were so sore that I couldn't run again for 2 weeks.  See 'Lessons Learned' below!  This prompted me to do some real reading on minimalist running.  I learned I was running way too much on my front foot and not letting my heel stretch out naturally.  I have since moved towards more of a mid-foot strike where my heel just barely kisses the ground.  I was afraid of cutting my feet so I avoided barefoot running.  I wish I had did a bit of this at first as it does naturally teach you how to run with smaller, quicker, more efficient steps.  In any case, after a couple months it was clear that all my knee, ankle and IT band pains JUST SIMPLY WENT AWAY.  It became obvious that the repetitive heel striking of old, no matter how slight it seemed, when repeated thousands of times over the course of a run, adds up to the problems I had experienced with running all my life.  Since I was still running small distances and rather slow, I was not convinced yet.  However, running was now also fun for some reason.  Maybe it was just a magic feather running around in these funny looking shoes or maybe my body actually liked this new running style.  I wasn't sure.  And, as an added benefit my calf muscles were getting huge!

* **Results after 9 months**:  I am happy to report that I can knock out six miles with an ease that I never imagined possible and most importantly it is 100% PAIN FREE.  ok, well, my calves get sore after a good run, but that is a good pain!  I know my muscles are building and I look forward to adding another quarter mile or more to my distance every next week.  I honestly see no end in sight.  I feel like now that I've worked thru the first few months of foot muscle and ligament readjustment, it is now all downhill from here.  I fully expect to be running 10-15 miles at a time by the end of this summer.  I'm so addicted to running now I wonder if I will be running marathons at some point and running the Leadville 100 before long (ok pipe dream of course).  I'm slowly adding speed to my technique and I can run about as fast now as I used to in my old heel-stompers.  My calf muscles feel like spring-loaded machines.  When they have rested a few days, I feel like i'm running in low-gravity.  The quicker strides are more efficient.  Everything feels right.  I find I am smiling during and after runs.  Before, I recall just wanting to get the run over with.  There is definitely a significant mental component to running; when you want to be out there it is a totally different experience.  When i see heel-stompers slamming their weight into the ground it is painfully obvious what was going on. 

* **Lessons learned**: Your first few times out, start slow and only go a few blocks.  See how sore you are the next morning and increase distances slowly until you have a feel for how fast your calf muscles are adapting.  If you start too quickly, which i did, you will feel like when you were a teenager and hit the bench press for the first time and couldn't cross your arms for a week.  Progress is sloooooow.  I estimated I added a quarter mile to my max distance per week or about a mile per month.  I experienced some small, dull pains in my feet which I attributed to my feet adjusting to significant muscle growth and various ligaments stretching out.  These always went away within hours or the next day.  Some minor acute pains cropped up and when they did I laid off right away.  Again, these went away pretty quickly and I think this too has to do with your foot re-adjusting.  At about the 7 month mark, I got too excited and ran 25 miles in one week.  The next week one of my achilles tendons became agitated.  I knew enough to know you NEVER want to injure your achilles significantly b/c it takes a long time to heal and has a memory of injuries so I laid off for 2 weeks with only light running.  The bottom line is to be patient.  You can get injured doing this if you run too much too fast.  However, if you train at a steady pace, you will reap major benefits and discover the joy of running in a way you have never before.  Also, let your calves rest.  If you max out a run, give them 2 or 3 days off.  

Oh, one last thing... VFFs smell BAD!  :(  I'm still trying to figure this out.  They are basically like socks so you really need to wash them regularly.  My last experiment with just soaking them in water with lots of baking soda seems to work the best.  I may end up switching to Huaraches or just super light 0-drop running shoes so i can wear socks.  It is a shame b/c VFFs are fun to wear otherwise.",,False,,t5_2rp0r,False,,,True,t3_tq8ft,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/tq8ft/my_experience_after_nine_months_of_minimalist/,

1306858605.0,31,self.BarefootRunning,hob63,Couch to Half-Marathon (barefoot) in 18 months,computertech,34,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/hob63/couch_to_halfmarathon_barefoot_in_18_months/,"I thought I would share my story about running. 

March of 2010 I weighed myself and I was about 180 pounds (I am short 5'6""). It was normal for me to sit on my ass all day (I am a computer guy) and eat a lot of junk food. I felt bad all the time, had headaches and when I ran my ass and boobs would shake around (and I am a dude).

I then decided to start running. My wife had been running her whole life and I told her I wanted to start running with her. First day I went about half a mile and was dying, my shins were killing me and my lungs were burning, my head was exploding in pain. I pushed through, next day I went a little over a mile and an accomplishment for me was to be able to run for more than 5 minutes without stopping.  I was in a lot of pain, I would come home and ice my knees and shins. We did that for a week or so and I signed up for my first 5K.  

While training for the 5K I went out and got some $200 shoes, I thought it would help make the pain on my ""superior extensor retinaculum"" go away.  It did not and I decided to do that 5K anyway. Half way through the the 5K I could bare the pain in my feet so I took my shoes off and ditched them and all of the sudden the pain went away.. I sped up and passed about 50 people on my way to the finish line. I felt great and realized that maybe barefoot running was for me.

I then stopped by a running store on the way home and bought some Vibram five finger classic style. Two days later I ran in them and I couldn't believe: I ran some good 4 miles and I felt great.. or so I thought. Turns out I was doing too much too quickly.. and my calves felt like they were getting stabbed with every step I took. But what does a runner do when they are in pain? they run harder.. so I did, I went on.. running 5Ks, 10Ks until one day, half way during a 4 mile race something popped in my feet. It was the infamous plantar fasciitis. I was able to finish the race completely barefoot but the pain was too much. 

That day I got the book by McDougal ""born to run""  and devoured it, reading the book and watching youtube videos I realized that I have been running the wrong way. That whole time I had been running like a sprinter, using only the soft part of my foot (right below my toes) and my toes and my heels didn't even touch the ground. Basically, that destroyed my arch and killed my calves.  i thought I was done. 

I then got another book by Michael Sandler called ""Barefoot Running"" and I actually went to a book presentation by Michael. In the book I learned that I had been doing too much too quickly and that If I were to run barefoot I had to start properly and take my time. 

So we did that, my wife and I wrote out a program based on Michael Sandler's program. At first it felt stupid, for example: ""first: 100 yards on grass / rest two days, second: run 200 yards on grass / rest two days"" I had zero faith on the program. However, since my plantar fasciitis was still bad I gave it a shot anyway. I did that program plus stepping and massage-rolling the bottom on my foot on a baseball a couple hours a day.

After a couple of months I was up and running 5Ks again, completely barefoot, last /November I ran 10K race through Philadelphia and New Jersey.  During the winter I realized I could actually run in any surface (snow or ice) if the temperature was above 35F. 

I have signed up for a half marathon in September and a couple of 10Ks before then. Also, I got second place on a 5K :) in my age category (Male 19-29) and I was the only barefoot person there (usually I am). 

I have been practicing running a 5K every other day and then once a week I run as far as I can. Last night I ran 10 miles (my record) and besides a busted nail and sore muscles I feel great.

So, what is the bottom line? 

1. Start slowly
2. Don't run if you hurt
3. Watch videos and ask people
4. Focus on your posture while running: straight back, heels kicking up, front/mid foot landing, use your toes and your foot muscles to bounce your body up. 
5. You should feel smooth, light and ""rolling"" while running. In other words, your running should be a continuous motion, almost like flying low.

tl;dr: I went from being a lazy ass to running 10 miles (and loving it)  in 14 months.

I got one in the pad of my left foot on one of my first real barefoot days this spring. I couldn't stand being out of the game so soon after it began and decided to turn to the internet for help. 

A pretty common suggestion was to tape a piece of bacon fat over the puncture and leave it overnight. I happened to have some lard on hand and put a dab of it on my wound. I taped a plastic bag over it and spent a few hours flexing my foot. With some squeezing and a little help from a sterile scalpel (really just a little prying, no divit, no blood) I got the splinter (turned out not to be a thorn) out!

Not sure why this works. Maybe skin absorbs oils from the fat that help make it pliable, maybe it lubricates the object. Anyway, I hope this comes in handy!

There are probably some infection risks with this method.

I started barefoot running about a year ago, first w/VFFs, use Adidas Adipures in the gym and run home in the grass barefoot, now run in Merrill Road Gloves or Trail Gloves - I even wear RGs as my ""normal shoe"". While my running has improved significantly, I still find that I heel strike from seeing photos of me and feeling pain in the bottom of my right foot.

Yes, I do a lot of hill training, especially concentrating on up hills and good form/posture. Yes, this seems to occur most often at the end of long endurance runs when I am sprinting. Yes, it's also possible that I'm most heel striking in front of the camera. :D

The pain just doesn't seem to go away and I'm trying to relax my arch as much as possible.

I've yet to go full-time barefoot and certainly don't want to go back to foot-coffins.

I've been wearing VFFs since 2007 and, as I'm sure you know, the one thing that comes up for everyone is how smelly they can get. They really just don't breath very well, unfortunately.

The newer models have anti-microbial stuff, but that takes about one week of not wearing them to be truly effective on its own. You've got to be a little more proactive.

Here are a few tips and tricks I've used:


* Baby powder

Put some baby powder in the shoe and/or on your foot prior to wearing them. It can keep your feet a bit more dry, less sweaty and less smelly.


* Tea tree (or some other) essential oil

Apply a few drops of an essential oil (peppermint, tea tree, whatever) to the top of your feet before wearing the shoes. You can also drop a few in the shoes (heel and sole ball area) before wear and before washing them. Note that if you wash your essential oil'd VFFs with other laundry, the entire load will smell like the essential oil. This will not prevent odor, but it can mask it really well.

* Baking soda

If you are letting the shoe sit overnight, pour some baking soda in it and swish it around. You don't need a bunch. It'll smell a little better in the morning. Pour out the baking soda before use. 


* Pre-clean with a toothbrush

Before cleaning in your washer, really get in there with a toothbrush (or any brush that fits) and get the gunk out. Even coat the brush with something that cleans and/or smells nice. If you want, you can just soak them in water and clean with a brush. Also, you can just do this at the end of every day with a dry brush and some baking soda, then put a few drops of essential oil in them.


* Try to wash once a week

Yea, there isn't much you can do if you've been wearing them in hot weather for 4 weeks straight. If the footbed is solid black, it is time to clean those sonsabitches. 


* Wash your feet when you can

Just finished your workout at the gym? Go wash your feet real quick! Just showed up to a friends house and need to take your shoes off? Leave the shoes outside to air and excuse yourself to use their bathroom to wash 'em up real quick. You don't have to announce ""HOLY SHIT gotta wash my feet!"" Just go take care of it if you get the chance.


* Consider two pairs

The most expensive option. One pair for non-exercise use, and one pair for exercise use.

If anyone has any other tips, please share!

Priceless.,torsojones,34,7,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/u9z2b/first_barefoot_hike_this_weekend_the_looks_i_got/,"The total distance was about five miles round trip, but I only went barefoot for the first two. Up until this point I had been walking around barefoot as much as possible, for about a week, including one jog that lasted about five minutes before my calves gave me the finger.

Overall, the hike went very well! The barefoot portion was all uphill, covered with rocks spaced out *just* enough to provide maximum pain without any possibility of avoidance. Perfect for cherry-poppin'! I was hiking with two others who were shod, and although I was always third in line, I kept up alright. The ground was surprisingly hot, much hotter than I expected for how cool the air was, which had me a little worried about blisters. Just another little thing you'll only notice barefoot! 

After two miles of this, I could feel my feet starting to get very tender, and saw the trail getting even rockier. Uninterested in making a TMTS post when I got home, I decided to throw on some sneakers for the rest of the trip.

Now, the trail was pretty crowded with other people, and I got quite a few interesting remarks:

""Mountain man! I love it!""
""Good for you!""
""Ha! Don't need no stinkin' shoes!""
""Ooooh :(""
""Ouch!""
""Doin' it the hard way, eh?""
""Where are your shoes!""

And a number of others who just stared with faces of horror.

It's been a day, and the damages are actually minimal. I have a little pain in my left heel from coming down on a few sharp rocks, the balls of my feet are a bit sore, and I have a minor blister on each of my big toes.

I'm now a few days into 10 minutes (about a mile).  

Some things I've noticed:

* I'm focused on my stride and whole body such that I stopped running with my iPod.

* When I run with shoes and then without, back to back, no matter which order I do it, I am light and responsive and full of energy barefoot, where I am a bit tired and fatigued in shoes.

* my two torn and arthroscoped and re-torn menisci often flare up in shoes, and if I take my shoes off right then and keep running, it goes away!

* got two blood blisters on the outside ball of my feet, that sucks, but I got them when I pushed my stride wide trying too run fast - and now I've learned that doesn't work.

* I have a muscle on the top outside of my foot that has, like, doubled in size in the past twenty days.  It went from being walnut sized to plum sized.  Neat.

* My chronically sore lower back (years on years on end) is gone now.

* running shoes, pretty much the only kind of shoe I've been able to wear comfortably for the past twenty plus years, are no longer comfortable.  I'm either barefoot or in flips flops, all day long.

Barefoot running, or walking, or just plain living, appeals to good sense.  And now my cautious experience is proving it for me.  I'm not going back.

The cold weather (about 2ºC) forced me to don the Merrell's with a pair of Injinjis. I missed a turn, adding about 3kms to my total distance, but I still managed to finish 11th (in a small field) overall.

Thanks to midfoot striking, a higher cadence and smaller strides, I feel my usual post race soreness to be mostly absent from this run. Also, even though this has been my longest race of the season, my pace was the fastest, something I am attributing to my new choice (or lack thereof) of footwear.

Actually I have trouble when I wear any shoe for more than 15-20 minutes, but that's just me.  

This past Friday, I had worn toe shoes without socks from 8 am until 9-10 pm.  I washed my feet when I was able to take the shoes off, and about 5 minutes later my feet stunk again.  I was with my sister who loves homeopathic medicine, so she got a book out and ""diagnosed"" me with stinky feet.  Her solution was a tea soak (like the one I linked to - just to show I wasn't crazy, because I thought she was when she suggested it).

Here's what we've done:

- Prepare 2 regular black tea bags (Lipton is what we've used so far) in a mug.  Pour boiling water over them and steep for 15 minutes.  

- In a pan large enough to fit both of your feet prepare enough warm water to fully cover your feet. 

- After tea bags have steeped add the ""foot tea"" to the water.

- Soak your feet for 30 minutes (I'm doing this as I type).

- After 30 minutes towel dry your feet.

- After feet have aired out prepare the following solution:
1 tablespoon on lemon juice
2 drops of lemon oil extract

- Put the above solution on a cotton swab and swab feet.

- Let your feet air dry again.

- Try to stay barefoot as much as possible.

I've had 3 days of no stinky feet for the first time in my adult life.  I even wore hiking boots with wool socks, and no smell.

As to the shoes, I put anything I'm going to wear on a boot dryer the night before to take care of moisture.  

So far this has been successful for me.  When I told coworkers today about the remedy and its success so far they acted like their lives would be changed forever!  I hope this helps someone else out there.",,False,,t5_2rp0r,False,,,True,t3_115w39,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/115w39/stinky_shoes_stinky_feet_a_solution/,

About 2 years ago I had a lot of back pain issues, I was pretty overweight and my heart would race whenever I picked my son up. 

Now, 35 pounds less later, a couple ultramarathons and many marathons later I am ready for my first 100 mile race.

So, on April 7th I will run the ""100 mile endurance run"" in Philadelphia and I need lots of help. The run won't have any crew people available or medics or anything like that. I got a couple of my friends to either run or bike with me already but not very many of them committed. It is a 8 mile loop and my goal is to do 12.5 loops. Each runner is supposed to bring his own crew and I am wondering if you guys might be interested and willing to commit your time to help me out.

Timing won't be perfect. The 88 minutes per loop estimate is just that, an estimate. So, if you are willing to run/bike we ask that you take that into consideration and maybe show up an hour before your running/biking time.

The race will start Saturday (April 7th) at 6 am, each 8 mile loop will take me approximately 88 minutes to complete. We are expecting the last loop to start at 12:52am.

Las thing, my wife will be checking my health (blood pressure, weight loss and etc) after every loop. I am thinking about buying a blood pressure monitor thing, do you think I should bother? what other health pointers should we measure?

By the way, I will be doing the whole thing barefoot.

Thank you guys - hope some of you can make it! If you are out of State and want to come in let me know and I will help you get a place to crash.

The original minimalist shoes?,rainbowtastical,27,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/1i4qs4/traditional_ethnic_footwear_the_original/,"I was poking around the internet on a minimalist shoe treasure-hunt earlier and thought I'd share! After wearing the same pair of VFF KSOs for 2+ years on-and-off, I've been wearing them almost exclusively for the last 3 months because I now work in a place that lets me do that. I also picked up a pair of Minnetonka soft-soled short boots from a garage sale that have definitely seen better days, but I love them because they go much better with pretty sundresses than my now-super-dull-blue KSOs.

These soft-soled boots got me thinking... what else is out there? What other options are there for useful-yet-stylish minimal shoes? Specifically, what did people in other climates wear before someone decided it was a good idea to include things like support and gait-alterations in our daily footwear? Its not like they had the option to suck it up and wear things that weren't so great for the needs of their feet and environment... they had to figure out something or they wouldn't have survived.

I started off thinking about mocassins, which eventually lead me to think about taller and warmer boots made for colder climates... like mukluks. But my searching has proved relatively fruitless on that front, which I'm disappointed about. The only [company](http://www.mukluks.com/) I can seem to find that makes muk-luks doesn't have a soft-sole version available. From what I've read, the muk-luk would be awesome for those of us in search of a warm, water-proof shoe for winter when the leather has been treated properly.

[Babouches](http://www.boutique.dedor.com/images/products/784/6084464_thumb.jpg) are also pretty straight-forward... A few pieces of leather sewn together, and they can even be worn multiple ways! Minimal, yet resourceful.

In a more summery spirit, there are the Caligae sandal(aka gladiator sandal), which you can [make yourself](http://www.legiotricesima.org/campusMartis/MakingCaligae/MakingAuthenticCaligae.html), the huerache, and the [tsarvili](http://img05.prodavalnik.com/images_prodavalnikcom/20594743_1_585x461.jpg). All traditional, all very functional, and all with a minimal sole.

And there are more, too... clearly there are some that [are the opposite of good for your feet](http://top5s.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/1137.jpg)(lotus shoes), and others that we have [adopted almost completely](http://www.nihonzashi.com/Uniforms/ZoriY.jpg)(zori shoes), but it looks like a good deal of traditional footwear was relatively minimal.

I just think its interesting that we're now moving back towards the same things that were around hundreds of years ago, now that we've had a chance to see what more structured shoes actually do to your feet. I'm also excited to find that there is such diversity in minimalist footwear for both men and women! Its been frustrating reading the posts and not seeing much in the way of ""girly"" shoes... but the more traditional shoes fix that, too, especially [ghillie shoes](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Ghillie.JPG)!

But I soon found that was actually irritating my sciatic nerve after about 3 miles and causing numbness.

On a whim I bought some KSOs after reading about them. Wow what a difference, jogging/sprinting was actually fun, my nerve didn't flare up, and I had a bounce in my step I never had before. Also, WOW all those muscles I had never used before.

But about a month ago I was jogging along a particularly rocky beach, and probably landed on a sharp rock right in the ball of the foot near my second toe. I say probably because it was fine until the day after.

Went to my doctor, he told me to take it easy so I stopped my routine (which sucks). The pain was slowly improving, until about 1 month later I decided to try jogging again only to make the injury worse.

He refers me to a podiatrist who tells me:

1. No more barefoot running on the beach (I didn't mention Vibrams).

2. I have a slightly longer 2nd toe which I guess contributes to impact in the ball of my foot.

3. I have to buy insoles and metatarsal pads to relieve pressure off that spot.


So, basically I'm screwed here. No more bare foot running? I'm hoping the injury will heal with all the pads and insoles he recommended.

I'd read this reddit before, and used to run in high school, so it wouldn't be that hard. I finished but my calves were both strained, so i took 4 to 6 weeks of rest, light running and whatnot. I've quit smoking, and started eating healthier. 

This time i lined up for a trail style 5k with my brand new vibrams, a refined running stride, and a slight buzz (for hedonism's sake)

I realize that this isn't a topic for the hardcore barefoot enthusiasts, but some of us have social conventions to adhere to and perhaps just like wearing shoes as part of our wardrobe.


So, what should you look for in your everyday shoes if you want to keep your feet strong?


1.) Soles should be both thin and flexible.
2.) Shoes should be lightweight.
3.) There needs to be enough space for your forefoot to go through its natural range of motion, i.e. the toebox should be comfortably wide.


With this in mind, what are some shoes that fulfill all these criteria?


During the summer, Luna Sandals can be worn instead of normal flipflops, and I would argue that they are even quite fashionable. Perhaps more so if you for the thin leather laces or the 3/8 Equuus laces, but they beat Birkenstock's by a mile.

Otherwise, I have been going with Onitsuka Tiger's Mexico 66, but they could be more minimalist.

Does anyone have any experience with Chucks? They seem to have a thin sole, but it appears to be quite inflexible. Does this change after they are broken in?

Yesterday I ran a 5k in VFF Komodo's - my first run of this distance in non traditional running shoes. The run felt pretty good and I have only been running in VFFs for about a month and a half. I still have to concentrate on my form but it's coming along nicely I think, and I am able to maintain a good rhythm while running without having to think about it too much anymore. After this run I realized a few things: it felt significantly easier to run this distance in VFFs than in traditional running shoes - maybe due to the efficiency of barefoot running and the spring like work of the achilles tendon and calf muscle. I did not feel challenged aerobically at all after this run despite running it at my usual pace (approx 24 mins) and I hardly broke a sweat at all. I did however notice that my calves, hamstrings and glutes felt as if they had gotten wayyyy more of a workout than in my previous runs with trad. running shoes. I do have some calf soreness today, but it's very manageable and definitely nowhere near as bad as when I first started running with minimalist footwear. My only other observation was a bit of pain at the base of my second toe on both feet at the end of the run. This didn't last long after the run however. If anyone has any experience with this kind of thing let me know. 

When I first started trying to learn to run this way, it was very frustrating. I didn't like feeling as though I needed to learn to move all over again. I didn't like that I had to scale back my running so much. But I feel much better now that I am able to do it somewhat successfully and I am motivated to be close to my full distance runs again. My goal is to run a half marathon in VFF's by next summer. For anyone else starting out - keep at it and have fun.

I run on a sidewalk the county is working on connecting from a beach park below where I live all the way out to the resort hotels in Kaanapali. Today was the first time I actually ran (albeit slowly) the whole way there without walking. 

To celebrate this, I decided to take off my shoes and walk on the actually beach all the way back to the park. I got my feet wet and when the sand flattened and wasn't so slope-y, I jogged a little bit.  

Near the end, a girl in a bikini passed me and all I could think was how much deeper her foot prints when into the sand than mine did. I kept my shoes off as I clambered over some wet grass to the sidewalk and then walked/trotted a bit till I came to where I cross the highway to go home.

*Tough run this morning, but good. We ran 7 miles at around 8:30 am. It was cool, 46 degrees. Wore hat and gloves and sweatshirt. Because of the cool temps, I didn't wear the hydration pack, just the fanny pack with a water bottle for each of us. I drank water, Bri drank Gatorade.*

*This was my first long run in the new huaraches from www.invisibleshoe.com. I think they did very well. I had no concerns about them staying on, and they really do feel very much like being barefoot. There were a few times when the front dragged under, but that is when my form is slipping because I am either tired or distracted by something. It's a good indicator when I need to adjust my stride and pick up my feet some more.*

*At the end of the run, I was really beat. At about the 5 mile point, I got a small rock between my foot and the sole of my shoe, and it didn't want to leave. I didn't want to break stride/rhythm to get it out so I left it there. But it wasn't that big a deal anyway. The last mile of this run was difficult. My ankles, legs and pelvis areas hurt. I think I am using a somewhat different set of muscles in these shoes than what I used with the Vibrams. 12 hours later I still feel sore, but it's a good sore. No injuries or anything like that. I did get a small blister on the left side of my left foot, same place as in the previous 2 shorter runs in the huaraches (from the left side ankle knot).

* Really run barefoot to start!: Only rarely use minimalist shoes, if at all, for weeks. You won't be able to run far but at first... that's good! Prevents overuse injury, which is wicked easy to do. The feel will help you know when you are pushing or doing something wrong. I never 'got it' until after I started jogging more purely barefoot (after a shod run is a good time, just take off the shoes and hold them). After you 'get it', still run really barefoot every once in a while to keep your form tuned.

* Don't push with your feet!: Lean forward to speed up, backwards to slow (pretend you're a segway). Try running in place, then lean forward. Each foot fall should catch directly under you, push you up a to recover from the drop, then lift off cleanly as you move ahead. Your run should really just be a sustained fall forwards...

* Placement: although obviously don't land on your heel, don't over-exaggerate landing on the ball and cushioning with an over-long heel drop. I believe this caused me an ankle injury (overuse) when I started. Your heel should kiss the ground before lifting off again. You should hear a nice light 'tap-tap-tap' if you're doing it right.

* Cadence: unless you are going up a hill or jogging very slowly, your cadence should be fairly high, like 3 strikes per second. This means your step will be short. Count triplets to seconds in your head if it helps. 

* Be a wheel: keep your knees bent and hips low and upper body relatively vertically stable. Actually speed up and down with slight dips in the terrain. 

Any others or better descriptions of the above?

EDIT: I forgot to mention: running on a rocky, root covered trail, and/or hot footing like you were a footballer on a ladder or tire exercise, helps get both the light step (what if you step on a sharp rock or acorn? You have to not have all your weight on it) and quick pace going. It is more cardio at first, but so is barefoot running...",,False,,t5_2rp0r,True,,,True,t3_jhj70,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/jhj70/anyone_want_to_share_form_tips_for_barefoot/,

Now I am in the Air Force, so when we do our PT sessions, regulations say we have to have footwear, but VFFs are authorized (as long as I wear socks) I get so many looks. So many questions. All I say is it may not be for everyone but for me it renewed my interest in running.

I've taken it REALLY slow, trying not to injure myself when transitioning to minimalist running, so I started out with 500m, then 1k, then increasing 1k per month. Now it's 7 months since I started, and I've overcome my initial beginner's pains and my feet feel strong.

So, yestersday, when running my planned 5k, jogging along in my Luna huaraches,  I felt like it went very well, and I ran very easily - so I decided to keep running until I've ran 10k.
I ran with an easy pace, even having to stop a couple of times to wait for traffic at crossings, and I didn't even get wery winded.
And when my running app announced that I had ran 10k, and I stopped to look at my phone, the time was 50 minutes, 5 sec.
That is no extraordinary time by any means, but it is much faster than I have ever managed before, and I didn't even try to run fast.

I have been building up my barefoot mileage and have only done about 4-5 miles up until now. Also I have always carried Vibrams with me just incase. 

Yesterday I set out on what was going to be about a 6 mile run and the conditions were nice enough I figured I could leave the vibrams at home. Right off the bat, not five minutes into the run, I feel a rock stick into my foot for more than a few strides. I check and sure enough there is a small sliver of glass embedded in the joint of my big toe. It was very small and I managed to work it out with out much trouble so I continued on. Definitely the first time I have stepped on glass.

6 miles turned into 7, then as approached my turning point in my loop I was feeling so good I decided to head the other way and go to the beach. Got to the beach and decided that I had come all this way, why not do a mile or so on the sand. Then I made my way back.

The last 3 miles were not good. The roads closer into town were busy and I was forced up onto the pebbly sidewalks, Ouch! 

All in all it turns out I did 16 miles, which is not only a personal record for barefooting but also just a distance record for me period. No visible cuts or blisters and my feet feel pretty good even just the day after.

I can remember being about 6 or 7 and having serious pain in my legs from just running and playing. 

When I was in high school I joined the track team in an effort to be interested in sports. Within a month of practice I ended up at the podiatrist having my feet looked at and my gait analyzed. He told me that I was flat footed and need to buy these incredibly ugly, bulky running shoes and I had to wear them every day. Well, being a kid in high school I said ""Fuck that noise."" and wore them only at track practice. They did help with the shin splints I was getting but they were SO heavy and I felt like my feet were encased in cement blocks. I finished out the season and did not return to track the next year for other reasons.

About the same time I quit track, I got into the classic rebellious stage and as was the trend, I wore Chuck Taylor's every single day. Incredibly, I found that I didn't have any pain in any part of my legs when I wore them and up until 6 months ago I continued to wear them every day. 

I heard about ""toe shoes"" through my cousin and our good friend. They had the Fila Skeletoes and I though they looked interesting. When I had the chance I googled ""toes shoes"" and VFF's popped up. I hadn't even known Vibrams existed until then. After discovering this whole barefoot movement and the science behind being barefoot, I decided to give it a go and bought a pair of bikilas and a pair of sprints.

At first I walked a little awkward in them since I wasn't used to having my toes separated like that and I was still hell striking in them. I almost gave up on them for a bit because I just couldn't get the hang of walking in them. Then one day I decided to stop concentrating so hard on the proper form and from then on I had no issues with it.

I have to admit I fell in love with my VFFs. As someone who is prone to massive blisters when I walk long distances, these were a god send. I can't tell you how many times my daily outtings were cut short because I was getting a blister. My boyfriend even noticed that I hadn't been complaining about blisters and that's saying something because he's not very observant.

Not only were my blisters gone, but I found that my lower limb issues were fading. I have no problem walking 5 or 6 miles without discomfort, and I mean NO discomfort. I was sold on shoes.

Now that it's winter, I have to started wearing shoes with a little more oomph to them. I recently switched back to my Chuck Taylor's and while they're not exactly snow boots, they still keep my feet fairly warm. I have noticed that my feet have widened out a bit and my formerly comfortable Chucks are feeling a little too tight for me. I've also noticed exactly how much friction there is in them. For short term, the Chucks work fine, but I definitely won't be using them for every day shoes.

Now I'm not meaning to sound like an advertisement, so I'll tell you the issues I have with VFF's. My last two little toes sometimes feel encased in rubber and I don't have as much movement with them as I'd like (at least in my bikilas, the sprints are much better). The VFFs also took a while to get used to as far as a natural gait and having separated toes. Sometimes I feel as though they are too thin and stepping on larger pebbles and other pokies causes more discomfort than in Chucks. I've also noticed that after long walks, my feet swell a bit and the openings of the shoes get a bit tight; I'm constantly readjusting the strap on my sprints because of this. I don't like the way they are sized either: my big toe fits, but I have at least a quarter of an inch of extra shoe on my three middle toes and just barely any room on my pinkie toe.

That being said, I plan on making VFFs my shoe of choice for a while. I know I should be going completely barefoot, but I'm not brave enough for that and I couldn't even imagine the blisters. I plan on buying two more pairs in a few weeks and I'm even open to suggestions for other brands. Also, I'm seriously considering taking up running again as I've put on a few pounds and I feel comfortable enough now with my legs and feet to do something more strenuous than walking.

What are some of your stories with going barefoot/barefoot footwear? I'd love to hear your experiences.

Up to that point, I had tried barefoot running a few times, say on treadmills and short jogs around the block. 

However, with my litany of injuries from the military, running shod mostly and running barefooted occasionally was not cutting it anymore. My sciatica flared, my stress fractures would greet me, and my lower back would ache into the night.

So, I got serious. I started running barefoot on a rubber track. 3/4 mile to start, up to a mile and a half, then two miles. Felt great! But I didn't feel quite efficient...

About two months ago, I read How to Run Barefoot by Barefoot Ted. I thought it would be a gimmick. My soles knew everything about running barefoot -- what could a book tell me? Little did I NOT know about running efficiently and bending your knees!

Two weeks after reading that book, I went for a two mile run at full speed on pavement. I haven't done that since I was in the military. Certainly, I'm still out of shape to run like I was 18, but the pure exertion was exhilarating! It felt fantastic to run without pain after all these years.

Now, I'm running on sidewalks and throughout town on sidewalks and whatnot with no pain whatsoever. Actually, I prefer cement to the rubber track or gas. You definitely get more bounce!

So, my recommendation is to bend your knees, and keep at it if you've been trying to do the barefoot thing for a while.",,False,,t5_2rp0r,False,,,True,t3_l8e7s,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/l8e7s/9_months_later_running_on_pavement_in_my_full/,

So one day last week, I shelved my VFF's, took out my Brooks Adrenaline GT, and went out for a run.

1. Going back feels weird, like running on a mattress.
2. Never achieved a ""Zen-like"" state because I was constantly thinking about my foot strike and landing.
3. Felt clumsy and self aware that perhaps everyone was staring at me
4. Chaffed the ball of my foot in both feet.
5. Overall pain in both big toes.

After Basic Training, running became a major chore - I developed a stress fracture in my lower left leg. While I could still throw one leg in front of the other, pain would rocket up my leg.  Whereas before, every running step was invigorating, refreshing. Stress fractures are not fun.
 
So, I laid off running after Basic and Medic school and allowed the stress fracture heal. Then, I visited running again but the residual pain would always jolt me away from running. The only real running training I did after Basic was two weeks before my PT tests. Even running a couple miles, my leg would say, ""Better back the hell off before I break again!""  Towards the end of my enlistment, I just gave up running altogether and failed my PT tests. Yeah, I was that trash bag.
 
I wish I had known back then what I know now. *I was running all wrong.* 
 
Everything I was taught - run on your heel during regular speeds, get on your balls for sprints, wear corrective shoes for your flat feet and broken arches, take long strides - were all a bunch of SHIT!
 
For the last month or so, I've taken a piece of evolutionary fact and ran with it: Humans are the best runners in the world. That is our physical claim to fame. Our bodies have been selectively bred to run barefooted for millions of years.
 
Our asses are huge, our feet have arches, we wick heat very well compared to other animals and in Africa, runners can kill their prey by running them into exhaustion. Some even say that Neaderthals, who were smarter and had language and culture before us,  were driven extinct by Homo Sapiens who ran circles around them.
 
A few years ago, Nike sponsored the Stanford running team because they were the best of the best. Nike found out that the runners didn't like their shoes - the runners prefered barefoot. This inspired NIke to release the 'Nike Frees' which were suppose to mimick barefoot running (close, but no cigar, thanks).
 
So, I started barefoot running. Yes, no shoes, and not Vibram Five Fingers. My gait, my position, my feet are totally different.  And best part of all, that pesky stabbing in my leg that loved to say, ""F YOUR BODY"" went away and has not revisited since. My strides are considerably shorter (kind of like a trot), my whole foot almost comes down as one (with a half-second preference for the ball), and corrective shoes have given way to the thickest part of your body with a naturally built arch to support my obese ass. I AM THE RUNNING MACHINE.
 
Now, running is fun again. Its invigorating and reinspired me to get physically fit again.

As of a few months ago, I have started running almost exclusively trails, nothing too technical for the most part, but now I'm starting to run into a problem.  Rocks.  Both of the last two races I was in were INCREDIBLY rocky (anyone who follows ultrarunning might be familiar with the Bandera course in Texas - if you've ever run it you know what I mean) and the beating my feet took was almost unbearable by the finish.  To an extent I expect to acclimate somewhat to this, but I was hoping to get some good feedback from the trail runners here on a good shoe for a rocky course.  I obviously expect to somewhat give up a bit of the true ""barefoot"" feel of the shoe for a good rock-fighting sole, but I wouldn't like to take it too far to the point where I feel like I'm wearing a traditional shoe.

The last serious run I did was 15 years ago at soccer practice in high school.  I always hated running; it was jarring, painful and generally an unpleasant experience.  

A friend of mine at work began barefoot running this year, and urged me to try it.  I did lots of research beforehand about proper barefoot running form, etc.  I bought some Merrell Trail Gloves (not ready to go totally barefoot just yet), and Saturday evening I went to our local paved bike trails and started running.

At first I could only go about 50 yards before I was tired and had to walk.  I kept alternating between walking and running for an hour, finding that I was able to go further with each running attempt.  

About an hour in, it finally just clicked!  I found the perfect pace, form, something.  It was nothing like thudding around the soccer field back in the day; it was more like flying, if that makes sense.  I knew I should stop or I'd be sore, but it was just too much fun.

In March I ran the LA Marathon in my VFF Bikilas and ran just about as close as I could to my target time 3:30, or about 8 min miles. I hit the wall at mile 20 and just kinda toughed it out til the end. My feet were in complete pain. To the point that I could barely walk, if at all. For about 2 weeks after, I experienced horrible pain in my feet bones, around mid-heel to front heel. For the first week, walking up stairs was near impossible. I had an old Vicodin prescription that I used with varied results. Overall, it was very unpleasant. I don't regret it because I put so much work into it. But I'd like to not have as bad a post experience for my next one.

I had been running in my VFF for about a year (about 3-5 miles 3-4x/week) when I decided to begin 18 weeks of training (mid November) for the marathon. I used Hal Higdon's intermediate marathon guide, which had me run up to 20 miles twice and everything in between. In all of those runs, I was able to finish the run without ANY pain. I literally had no pain for the entire training period. So I'm a little confused on why I was so messed up post marathon. I figure it has to do with the extra 6 miles plus running a faster pace (Higdon advises running the long run 45-90 seconds slower, which I adhered to).

I took a few months off of running so my body and feet would recover, but I'd like to start training for my next gig. I'm just not sure what to do. I wanna run another marathon but do not want to have another experience like that. I'm thinking that I didn't give my feet enough time to adjust to the mileage, which sucks because it takes so damn long for them to adjust. I wanna run another marathon!

I guess I'm just wondering anybody has had a similar situation and what they did to make it better. Thanks!

I recently made the switch to mid-foot running and using minimalist shoes about 1 year ago. For the trail I use Inov-8 Roclite 295. For the road I began with New Balance MR10, and then switched to MR00.

I followed a fairly strict schedule of my transition to minimalism:

* began first week with 3 days of light jog/walk intervals of no more than 1.5KM each day.
* the next 2 weeks I reduced the walking segment of the interval by about 20% each week.
* by the 4th week, i was jogging the full 1.5KM.
* starting with week 6 I began increasing mileage by around 10% each week.
* once I got up to around 8K each run, I began slowly building up a 4th day of running.
* I always stretch for about 20-30 minutes after each run.
* most days of the week I was doing foot exercises to help stretch the feet, achilles, and legs, courtesy of various minimalist website recommendations.
* I also had 2 days a week where i did some basic core exercises, like planks and situps and back exercises and lunges.

During the first few weeks I had no pains in legs, but some natural soreness in feet. As my form got better, the soreness in feet went away, and a slight soreness in calves appeared. I read this was normal and that it would go away. Well, fast forward a year and it still has not gone away.

Over the past year of training, I have taken 2 breaks in my otherwise consistent schedule. First break was about 3 months into training and was for about 3 weeks where I could not run due to some work obligations taking a toll on me. Second break I had was close to 1 year into my training (a month ago) and I took another 3 weeks off for family obligations.

During the 2 breaks, it was the only time my calve soreness went away. I could walk, stretch, jump around, etc all without feeling any stiffness or soreness in my calves. But outside those breaks, my calves have always been sore. It's not painful, but its uncomfortable. 

When I begin my run, the soreness disappears within first 5 mins.
About 4 hours after each run, the soreness starts up again and lasts until the next run.

So I am reaching out to all you experienced runners for some guidance before I give up entirely. Is it normal for calves to always be sore? Am I doing something wrong? What can I do to get back to feeling good?




**TL;DR:**
Took up minimalist running a year ago, primarily in NB MR00, and my calves never stopped being sore. Any advice?

I started running barefoot in April and after a few weeks could not stand to wear shoes anymore. A few times I have tried to go on shod runs but I just don't really like the way my body feels after a run in shoes. 

I am several weeks into a marathon training plan now and I plan on running a marathon on bare feet in December. This *may* be too fast a transition, when I think of going from shod runner to barefoot marathoner in ~8 months; the marathon plan seems conservative enough and I have made it up to a 9 mile run on bare soles without too much trouble. I feel like I just now ""get"" barefoot running and I am finally loose enough to use my legs like the springs they are.  

I typically carry a pair of Luna Sandals with me, just in case I have to bail on running the way that I want. I run with a SPI-belt, and I clip the belt through the sandal straps and carry the sandals with me. The sandals sort of flop around and drag on the belt, which I would like to avoid. 

Can anyone suggest a better way to carry a pair of sandals with me without them bouncing around (and without just carrying them in my hands)? Right now it is sandals but that may switch to VFF at some point in the future, if I can't stand the cold.

I thought it'd be an easier transition after switching to barefoot walking/running but it's quite different with the long static load. I have read reports of people developing foot pains several weeks in, too, but I'm not sure if they had the conditioning from barefoot running/walking. 

Do you find you have to constantly move even after using the standing desk for a while? And do you think continuing on a hardwood floor is ok or should I get a soft pad? I was just thinking a pad would be a crutch like shoes, but then again, if ancient humans ever stood for a long time it was probably on soft dirt (or they weren't even standing, they were probably squatting). 

On a related note, has anyone experimented with a setup for long term squatting while at the desk rather than standing?

The thought of going with no electronics but myself and running through the rain fascinated me so much!! but Texas summer was brutal this year.

So, last weekend, I got my wish... and today too!! All I can say is, learn to love it!! For anyone curious, these are some things I found out about running in the rain:

1. Concrete tends to be slippery. It forms a layer of dust, mud, dried up leaves that solidify, but when it rains all that lifts up and makes it very slippery. Slow down and walk if needed. Asphalt tends to provide great traction though.
2. Do not wear cotton! I invested in actual running shorts and shirts, and it finally paid off. The running gear will dry out quickly and will not weigh you down.
3. Your bear feet will dry up within seconds of touching a dry surface. What shoe do you know that can dry up instantly after being soaked!?
4. Your eyebrows move the rain out of your face so it doesn't fall in your eyes. Your eyelids help dry up any water that does fall in your eyes, but I was surprised how much water my eyebrows redirected to the side of my face.
5. Do not be afraid of mud! Walk over it and get that 'dirty' look. You can wash them on the puddles and your feet will be like new.
6. You can now walk over water!! Walk over those puddles. It felt amazing stopping and walking over puddles, splashing the water around as I walked. It brought back many childhood memories, and made my long run very worthwhile.
7. Feel like alpha when you see everybody turn around because water or mud covers the road and there's no way around it, or when you see people waiting out the rain under a building and yet there you are running like a madman :D You can now go anywhere you want. There are no limits to where you can go!
8. At the end, your feet will be very clean from all the water. Feel free to splash them one more time before finishing up.

Might have missed some. I'm still running on endorphins :) I always wanted to run barefoot so I can run in the rain.

I searched r/barefootrunning for basketball related threads and didn't find anything comprehensive.

I split my time between the vibrams and basketball shoes. There was a noticeable decrease in lateral movement during my first 15-20 games, but it was made up for in my downhill running ability. At this point the experience of playing a game feels natural, and I notice little difference in my abilities. What is noticeable is the difference in leg soreness and muscle usage.

Hit my first milestone! Broke 10 minute mile barrier in my vibram KSO.

Ten years ago I started lifting and put on about 60 lbs of muscle and never ran so the tendons in my feet and calves never caught up to the extra mass. I've had the KSOs for a few years simply for dead lift and squats but never ran. Been floating between 10-13% body fat since then. Then I started climbing (indoor boulderimg) and decided I need to be around 7-8% body fat.....

So I started reading about minimalist running in my VFF.  I started with .33 miles. The next time I went 0.5 and my calves were thrashed. I felt like I had been paralyzed and had to relearn to stride when I ran because I was a former heel striker when I was younger. Then the next time I went I went 0.75 miles then finally I ran a mile in 10:24. Since then I've just been shaving my time down. Next time was 10:00 then today was 9:2!

I'm hoping to work it down to 8 minutes and maybe a 25 minute 5k in the next few months and complete a v6 in climbing.

I never ran more than three miles without stopping before the switch to barefoot. I re-started my training barefoot. I ran around the block the first time, two blocks next time. My calves and feet were killikg me, but i kept stepping it up. 

I got some Merrell trail gloves and started adding those in, and going on longer runs, getting up to 1-2 miles within the first month.

Then I ended up taking a two week vacation and did a lot of hiking in my trail gloves, no running at all, but LOTS of elevation gain and miles hiking.

I ended up hurting my foot by kicking something in the garden, and was out of commission for two weeks, but I got back into it last week, and felt stronger than ever!

I hiked/trail ran 5 miles on Saturday (more hiking than running). 

Then on Sunday I got up and ran 3.47 miles non-stop(road running)!

That's not only my first non-stop 5k+, but my longest distance ever, and my longest distance in minimal shoes/forefoot striking. 

It took me 33 minutes, so I was no speed demon, but I did it! My calves and feet are a bit sore today, but i think i can officially say that i have transitioned to minimalist running successfully, and i have high hopes for the future!

I've dabbled in many different sports, but I've always enjoyed running.

I had some knee problems last year, but PT and a good set of shoes helped me, at least for the time.  Did a couple 10+ mile runs, really enjoyed myself.

But I don't want these knee problems coming back to haunt me in the future.  I've started running again this month, and incredibly enjoyed it, but I want to improve, and the more I read, the more I see so many success stories of barefoot running.  And as I am a guy who is up in the hills at least once a week, I think trail running would be an amazing experience as well.

So I'm going for it today.  I'm comfortable barefoot, walking around the house and the yard, so going to do a simple half mile at the park and see how it goes.  The amount of resources you guys have for newbies here is amazing, and I thank you!  I will post later today with the results!

Edit: Results!  Absolutely amazing!

I went down to a local park with a half mile loop around the lake.  I did 1.5 total, 1 walking, .5 running in between.  Getting the initial rhythm down was interesting-I wanted to default to heel striking, but resisted all but once (not surprisingly, down a small hill!)  It just feels so natural!  Landing on the ball/front side of the foot and kicking out, using that natural springboard!  You were all correct-I wanted to go on, but I resisted!

My one mistake was taking about 1/4 of the course on hot asphalt.  Have a few blisters on my feet from the roughness and heat, but a little lotion and a bandage and they will be good.

My biggest observation was the different parts that this style of running worked.  As mentioned, I've been plagued with knee troubles for a while, and usually at first during a run, I'm a little stuff.  This time?  Nothing.  No stiffness, no pain.  My knees felt amazing!  I could feel some calf muscles being worked that hadn't before, but joints all the way down were great.

Thank you so much for your inspiration guys!  I'm hooked-I'm an outdoorsman, and I could see trail running/mountaineering being a ton of fun!

I do have a couple final questions.

1. I'm used to running in general, so is it cool if I keep up this half-mile thing everyday?  (taking a day off a week to rest)

2. Would a 10-mile run by the end of the summer be out of the question?

3. What do you guys usually do during the winter?  I despise treadmills, but I imagine to maintain, it would be necessary.  (I live in the Northwest, so winters are cold).  Maybe some kind of insulated minimalist shoe?

4. (sorry for all these! last one).  While I know it is good to get the form down barefoot first, I'd like to transition into this as a lifestyle.  Would a pair of minimalist shoes, maybe even some custom running sandals, be a worthwhile purchase just to walk around in and get used to, to eventually run in them?",,False,,t5_2rp0r,1340322480.0,,,True,t3_vdv9i,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/vdv9i/you_guys_have_inspired_mefirst_barefoot_run_today/,

The doctor said it looked like a football injury (I have never played football), as if someone had tackled me and forced my MCL  and knee to bend inwards. I didn't have health insurance (the doc only saw me because my parents had spent so much money with him, he did it as a favor, so I got a diagnosis, but no treatment other than a leg brace...still it was free, so no complaints). 

I rehabed on my own, but wasn't able to do any distance at all without horrible pain in my MCL. But I kept up swimming and biking. A year later, the same thing happened with my other leg. 

It's been several years. I stopped swimming because even that hurt. But I miss running terribly. I've gained weight. So I read about barefoot running and bought myself VFF. I ran barely half a mile today and felt like a cripple, I was so slow. I concentrated on form (and it did feel weird striking forefoot to heel) and only did a half mile. Towards the end I could feel my right MCL throbbing. But not bad. 

I am looking for wisdom, advice and suggestions so I can run long distance, hard miles at a decent pace. I think barefooting is my only hope. 

Thoughts? 

EDIT: I want to thank everyone for their thoughts and encouragement. I have to admit that I have been so discouraged at times that I would never run again. Hearing stories about how you all have overcome injuries makes me feel like this is the right way. 

I think I will start doing some long walks barefoot (or in VFF's as I am not completely comfortable totally barefoot yet) and do some slow ""runs"" a couple of times a week to build up as you all have suggested. 

Just the idea that this might work is a huge encouragement. I realize I might not ever be as fast as I was, but heck, I'm not competeing in the Olympics. 

I just miss going out my front door and running. Going up the mountains and running. 

Thanks you guys. I have subscribed so I hope to be a part of this community.

1361510983.0,19,self.BarefootRunning,1907zl,Luna Mono Sandals: First Impressions,Dickie71,19,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/1907zl/luna_mono_sandals_first_impressions/,"I've had them about two weeks now and have done about 40k in them consisting of a few short runs and a couple of 10km runs.  I've never run in any kind of sandals before, although living in Australia, we wear thongs all the time.  I've also been running in minimalist shoes for a few yeas now, from Nike Free, to VFF to Innov-8.

1.  Blisters.  Blisters everywhere.  Small ones I grant you but at the end of those 10km runs I wasn't going to be able to wear the sandals again until my feet had repaired.  Fortunately the location of the blisters didn't affect me wearing my regular running shoes.

2.  ATS.  Pretty good, I was actually pleasantly surprised at how well the sandals attached to your feet.  I am still adjusting them though to find that sweet spot - in essence, I appear to be just making the tighter.  My only gripe is that at the end of my longer runs as I'm working up a sweat the strap on the back of the heel starts to slip.  I think the Oso has some rubber back there which the Mono doesn't which I think I could have benefited from.

3.  Monkey Grip.  I'm having a mixed experience, the grip is good, but it's almost so good that I think it's this that is causing my blisters.  It grips the skin so well that movement of the foot I think is causing the blisters.  If I had the choice I think I'd try the leather soles next time.

4.  Vibram sole.  The sandal was surprisingly firm which I didn't expect, this isn't a bad thing, in fact, I think it's firmness is partly why it sticks to the foot so well.  I did think the 12mm sole was going to be a bit spongy but it's definitely not.  One thing I'd wish they'd do is angle the front of the sole slightly, the sole is literally stamped out of some rubber which leaves that cliff at the front which is just begging to clip things - I nearly stacked it on my first run.  I have odd sized feet as well so I'm going to take them in to a bootmaker and get him to clip one of the sandals to better fit my foot.

5.  Heat.  Most of my runs have been pretty warm and I was hoping the Sandal was going to keep my feet super cool.  Unfortunately, I think that Monkey Grip is creating enough grip/friction that it's actually keeping my foot pretty warm.

6.  Trail running.  I've run a little bit on the trails and the thickness of the sole made for a comfortable run however some of the trails I run are a bit technical and not particularly well maintained.  I think the few occasions where a stick or branch has lodged itself between sandal and foot has put me off seriously considering these for my trail running.",,False,,t5_2rp0r,False,,,True,t3_1907zl,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/1907zl/luna_mono_sandals_first_impressions/,

I ended up actually buying a set of insole, which were actually incredibly comfortable. According to the machine I had flat arches and high pressure points on the balls of my feet and heels.

Yesterday, I found myself in some sort of weird deja vu and played around on the Dr. Scholl's machine while my boyfriend was off doing something else. This time the machine said I had normal arches and high pressure points on the balls of my feet and heels.

Now, I know that a random Dr. Scholl's foot mapping machine may not be the most reliable thing, but it's the same machine they used when I went through basic training to determine our foot type. The only thing that changed in the past year is my shoes. I went from wearing tennis shoes all the time to being either barefoot or wearing VFF's. The only conclusion I can draw is that being barefoot (or nearly barefoot as the case may be) has fixed my flat feet.

I honestly can't speak highly enough of the barefoot experience and the benefits that I personally have seen and experience. Some people scoff at the notion that my feet and legs are actually better and suggest it's a placebo effect and others are generally interested in what I have to say.

I've been running for almost the last six years but it's never really felt very good at it.  I would always listen to my body and end up walking almost half the time I'd be out running.

But after reading Born to run, I transitioned from regular running shoes to running in Converse Sneakers with better technique.  This was sort of alright except both my middle toes got fairly beat up.

I then went for a real barefoot run when the weather cleared up a few weeks ago.  It was okay, but I found almost all my attention was focused on not stepping on anything dangerous.

Last week I went ahead and got some Merell Trails Gloves.  I went on a few runs, but nothing very inspired.

But then I watched some more running technique and form videos and off I went for the last 3 days.

Now the thing that is the most counter intuitive about good technique is the steps/min.  When running starts to feel hard you can't slow down your steps per minute, this only makes it harder.  You actually have to speed up the tempo of your steps until you feel a sort of sweet spot.

Your muscles are designed to bounce at that rhythm.  Suddenly my running went from feeling like a slog to feeling like I was bouncing along.

The next important technique is to listen to your body, especially your calves.  If you feel your calves are straining, something is probably wrong will how you are landing on your foot.   Don't try to power through the strain, you have to find the technique that will get you around it.

The start of the race was pretty wet, because we started on grass, and immidiately after the grass we went up quite a steep hill. Because my feet were so wet, they were slipping around a lot and putting stress on my sandals so the straps on them broke off... All within the first minute!! So, I had the option of either stopping there and putting them back together, stopping altogether, running a 5k barefoot, or finishing the a 10k barefoot. I finished the 10k. It was very painful, and probably was a very bad idea on my part. I have been running barefoot more often, but no trail running like this race was. It was mostly huge chunks of rocks with some small gravel intermingled. But, even through the pain, I was able to push through it by following all of r/barefootrunning's advice! I tried to stay as relaxed as possible, and that really helped. Now, I can't wait to do more trail running completely barefoot!

http://www.chirunning.com/blog/entry/the-whole-story-on-shin-splints/

&gt;Since gravity is your main source of forward propulsion, in Chi Running, you are left with only the job of picking up your feet with each stride to keep up with your forward fall. This takes almost all of the work off the lower legs because they are only needed for momentary support between strides, not for propulsion. 



I've seen practitioners explain this with falling trees, flowing water (""If gravity couldn't move you forward there would be no rivers or streams, just waterfalls."" No seriously, that's what a Chi Runner wrote on Jason's site) and best of all the fact that all the elite Kenians have ""tiny legs, because they use gravity when running"". I must have watched different marathon broadcasts because none of those guys are leaning from their ankles.
Some Chi Runners will even even inform you that, impossible as it may seem, they are some sort of perpetuum mobile or maybe even a satellite, effortlessly orbiting the earth slightly above ground, gravity providing all the forward momentum they could ever want.


Concentrating on lifting the leg (""stepping over a log"") instead of forcefully pushing off with the foot doesn't magically stop the leg from moving you forward. Isn't the storage and subsequent release of energy the whole idea behind midfoot landings and a high cadence? Where does that energy go but up the achilles and calves and back into the ground, propelling you forward? Why do a lot of people get sore calves when transitioning to barefoot or minimal running, often described as the worst and deepest muscle ache they ever had when they overdid it? 

The lower legs do a lot of work in all of this. Danny Dreyer, the inventor of Chi Running, is in thickly padded shoes in all of the instruction videos I've seen, that way it's pretty easy to say that the lower legs are _only needed for momentary support_. If you do the exact same thing barefoot your achilles and calves will have to work quite hard and, most importantly, in a way they are not at all used to if you are just starting, to take the forces that previously went into your artificial cushioning. This will happen regardless of how much you lean forward.

There is no magic way of leaning forward and floating over the earth with hardly any involvement of your legs, you will have to start gently without artificial cushioning but there are still ground reaction forces. You have built-in cushioning and you will be using your tendons and muscles to absorb and release energy instead of your bones and joints (aka straight-legged heelstriking in padded shoes).

Start slow, listen to your body, _use your legs_ and enjoy.





edit:
&gt;best of all the fact that all the elite Kenians have ""tiny legs, because they use gravity when running"". I must have watched different marathon broadcasts because none of those guys are leaning from their ankles.

This is a bit unclear on my part, I'm not debating wether you should run perfectly vertical or have a slight lean here, I'm taking exception to the notion that I have seen Chi Runners in comment sections repeat over and over again which is that the elite African runners are in fact Chi Running, most likely without even being aware of it - which is funny in itself because that would hardly make it a ""revolutionary approach"".

Plus I can't even fathom the forward angle that would be necessary to get to those speeds by simply leaning forward and engaging your core. Remember, legs are only for momentary support in Chi Running.

I've found that by getting a ball, preferably a size 3 soccer ball or something similarly light and manageable, but not too light, is a great cheap training tool for running form. Please note that this is not considered ideal dribbling form for competitive soccer and is simply a training tool. Best place to look is your local thrifts store; I got mine for $1.50

First, begin with walking with the ball, and **not looking at it**. Ensure that you are looking ahead at your route always, if you get into the habit of staring at the ball it makes it even harder to start running with it.

As you walk, pick your knees up &amp; drive your hip forward slightly to let the natural falling motion of your body provide the forward momentum necessary to propel the ball. **Do not kick the ball!** 

The key is to time when your knee lifts such that your foot naturally drops with toes pointing down and strikes the ball all on its own; there is no need to think about kicking the ball. Ideally this ought to occur when the ball is sitting where your other foot would be placed if you were standing up straight with your knees slightly bent.

If it helps, you can think about ""punching"" the ball forward with your knee; pretend that it is hovering about 6"" above where your knee's level is when you are standing straight up. But if you do this make sure the movement originates at your center of gravity and not just from the quads.

Think about walking *with* the ball rather than attempting to control its path. 

Once you can walk without looking at the ball and keeping it going on a straight course, now try running with it. It will take a while, but eventually you'll discover some kind of rhythm where your feet strike the ball not on every stride but regularly, and you don't even have to think about it. Then ditch the ball and go trail running.
The upside of using a ball over running without one is that serves as a good training tool for uneven terrain if none is available. You can up the difficulty by bringing the ball with you while trail running. 

You'll quickly find that it is much, much easier to to scout obstacles in your path when you've trained with a ball, as it improves your ability to assess your peripheral vision in a quick and repetitive manner. Also, you might notice that your balance improves due to having to correct for crappy touches when the ball goes off course--this forces you to use your hips to change direction

EDIT: another important aspect I forgot, this is great training for trail running as the speed of the ball is never really constant unless you're running quite fast, so it builds in a lot of practice accelerating and decelerating

EDIT 2: this is also a great way to drill ""off balance"" running and could provide an interesting alternate 'run' to help avoid overuse injuries from running on perfectly flat pavement all the time (more an issue in the burbs)",,False,,t5_2rp0r,1356324671.0,,,True,t3_15at79,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/15at79/barefoot_running_drills_using_a_ball/,

In the army I was streamlined into a machine gun team, where you carry a lot of gear, but do little running.
 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatotype

I have been trying to get into running all my life, but I have always struggled. For my dream job, I need to be able to run 8km in 40 minutes. So I always kept trying to run, but the chin splints, knee and foot pain got really unbearable after 10-15 minutes.    

Two months ago I watched the documentary “The Prefect Runner” and decided to buy a pair of VFF “Flows” the next week and I started to check this subreddit more. 

http://www.theperfectrunner.com/

I walked in the VFF for about 3 weeks then started running in them. Then last week, the strangest things started to happen.

1) I started running faster than I ever had before. What use to take me 10 minutes, now only takes 7 minutes.  For a big guy this made me really happy. 

2) It feels like someone has installed springs in my Achilles tendons. Now when I run, it feels like my knees shoot forward without me telling them.  The documentary talked about the body’s natural springs, but I never imagined this. 

Could all this just be in my mind? Because for myself I had a “Sudden Clarity Clarence” moment, where I said, “Could I have always been a good runner and running shoes and poor education were holding me back?” Did anyone else experience or feel their body change after switching? 

Thanks for reading, I appreciate any and all advice and wish you all the best in running/health.

I walk around barefoot all the time, and I've noticed that my body just feels better during and after long walks.

Which ones are best for cold weather? I'm leaning towards the VFF KSOs right now, but I also want something I can wear everywhere. I'm open to suggestions, and thanks for the help! 

Edit-just started running today. I was only going to do half a mile, but it felt SO GOOD. I ended up running 1.25, which I know probably wasn't very safe.

Sometimes I run multiple times a week, sometimes I don't run at all for 2-3 weeks at a time, but never have too hard of a time picking up where I left off. 

I got interested in the barefoot movement a little over a year ago and bought some vibrams that I loved running in and wore them as often as I could. I wore out my vibrams and picked up some merrell toughgloves that I run in and also are nice enough looking to wear to work and school and stuff. 

Well this morning I went for my first barefoot run around the neighborhood. I ran about half of it on the sidewalk, and half on the grass next to it back and forth. 

Overall, it felt great! My muscles do not hurt as I have gotten used to the barefoot stride already, but the balls of my feet really hurt now. Good thing I have the day off as I am walking around bow-legged on the sides of my feet. 

It seems like the balls of my feet are somewhat squishy and were maybe one giant blister so I got a syringe and a good bit of clear fluid leaked out on each foot, yet they are still pretty painful to walk on and the balls feel pretty raw but the rest is fine. 

Any suggestions?

But I think that's made up for how great damp moss feels underfoot. It's also really nice to just walk through a stream and soak your feet. 

One thing I underestimated is how much it would slow me down. I was forced to always watch where I was stepping so I couldn't really trail run at all and I had to go at a pretty slow pace. Eventually I had to put my shoes on because I was getting paranoid that I wouldn't make it back before dark. 

Now I'm debating getting some VFF Treks because I wouldn't mind a bit of padding so I could handle some gravel and a bit of traction as well. Mud is incredibly slippery.

I was worried about the repetitive stress of the flat surface of roads because I wasn't able to build foot strength / distance as much as I would have liked.  Until today, my feet would ache too much after 8-10 miles so I would have to stop short and couldn't follow the training program I had in mind.  

I started with VFFs almost two years ago and generally prefer trails running for the nature experience and the excitement of a more varied proprioception.  Still, I have done a few 5-10K road races for the excitement of running with large crowds.

Hi all!

I Ran Cross Country and Track way back in high school (15 years ago)!
Recently got back into running after 10 years of no regular exercise. I was thin (6 foot, 170 lbs) just not in shape.

After about 2 months of about 15 miles per week (about 3 mile runs each run) back pain started. Got bad and Knocked me out for about 6 weeks.

Then I decided I probably went too hard too soon. Sedentary lifestyle to running in too short a time.

So I slowed down the running. Been hitting the gym (alternating upper and lower body) for about 6 months. My thinking is that my overall body / core was very weak and needed to be strengthened.

I also started working on my running form. Taking much smaller steps, increased cadence to 180, etc.

Now i have Increased running, up to 6 miles at a time. All trails. Lots of hills. 10 min pace. Running has been great.

Recently started having left knee pain. I am determined to be able to run for a very long time, so I want to fix this problem. I've been Focused more on my form.

I am transitioning from Brooks Cascadia (relatively light, something like 10mm heel to toe drop, trail shoe, neutral) to New Balance minimus trail 10.

First thing I noticed: wow, my feet slap the ground! I am noisy. I know that's a solid indicator of bad form.

On my first two runs with the new shoes (one on treadmill, one on trail), I had a moment where I bent my knees and it almost felt like I was prepping to sit on a stool. Felt much more strain on my quads. Suddenly knee pain disappeared and my footsteps were nearly silent.

It felt a bit awkward. Almost felt like I couldnt keep it up. Just kind of steange. Felt like I lost a few inches in height.

But it felt like a breakthrough. Am I on the right track? I can't seem to reconcile ""upright posture"" with bent knee / almost squatting feeling.
Any thoughts? Am I doing it right?

Thanks!!!

TL;DR: left knee pain. Trying to change form. Bending knee almost feels like squatting. Am I doing it right?

PS I have been lurking here for a while. Heard the Podcast about the barefoot runner (guy that did 80 marathons without shoes of any kind) and learned a lot.

Barefoot running: my attempt at fixing my stride

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPLVmS12RW4

I've been running barefoot off and on for the past two years, but more so in the past year. Initially, my knee pain diminished immensely when I switched from shoe running to barefoot running. However there's still a tiny amount of knee pain that has remained.

I went to a athletic apparel shop in my local mall with a group of friends, and for fun I tried their run analyzer. I was stunned to see how different my stride looked to how I imagined it. I just didn't realize my feet were following an imaginary line to that much of a degree, nor did I realize my ankles bent in, or my feet pointed sideways. But I honestly have little pain.

Since I still consider myself new to barefoot running, I'm still gradually building up my ability. I'm only running every other day and no more than four miles at a time until March, and then I would have been running barefoot continuously (for the most part) for a whole year.

I'm scared though that my running form is gonna fuck me up in the long run, so I want you guys to critique me. I am no expert on running, but I have read Born to Run -- the book that started the barefoot running craze. Yes, I'm aware of some of the criticisms of that book too. I also have a friend who's a physical education major who can help me out a bit. He's on the other side of the country, but maybe he can critique my videos along side you guys.

Anyway here's my theory: I run on roads, and I follow the white line on roads, so you can see an invisible line that my feet follow. I subconsciously want to run exactly on the white line, so my feet follow that.

Plus, I grew up on swim teams with my specialty being the breaststroke. Breaststrokers do the ""frog kick"", which involves flexing your ankle out. Many breaststrokers have a tendency to keep their feet pointed out to the side. As you can see, I'm doing this when I run. I'm assuming that's bad. How bad is it? And, no, I do not have any pain in my ankles.

In my ""normal"" stride, my feet land directly under me, following an imaginary line. I try to fix that in the second video by landing my feet on their respective side. Is that wise? or should I keep them directly under me like I usually do? Why hasn't running barefoot fixed my stride ""naturally""? Am I gonna tear apart my body if I continue this?

Any further comments, questions, or criticism is welcome! Thank you!

I had no problems until about two weeks ago. I did a 2-mile barefoot run that resulted in an aching pain in the top of my arches that went away after the run. The next day for some reason I did a 4-mile run in the KSOs, and actually came away limping. I'm 19 and in somewhat decent shape btw. I had pain just walking around for another day or two, so I took two weeks off (which almost killed me! :P). Once walking stopped hurting, I would break into a jog for like 50 yards every few days to see if I was healing. The pain would come right back every time.

During this time I figured out my problem. I'd been overthinking the whole forefoot striking thing, to where I was unnecessarily exaggerating it. After reading all these resources and things, I thought forefoot striking was something totally different that I would really have to try hard at, so whenever I ran I would concentrate on it to the point of almost running on my toes. It didn't feel quite right, but I thought that was just because I was new.

So today I went back out for the first time, about 1.5 miles, and just did what felt good. All I did was avoid that tell-tale slapping sound you get when heel-striking, and it went great! No pain, and it felt much more natural. So the moral of the story is, don't let all these internets influence you too much. Listen to your body!

**TL;DR:** Exaggerated forefoot striking due to reading too many BFR articles online. Got hurt. Tried a more natural stride and got much better results.",,False,,t5_2rp0r,False,,,True,t3_hhkgy,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/hhkgy/a_cautionary_barefoot_tale/,

I intended to wear them everywhere and also while I ran. I only ran track at the time because it was winter in Michigan and spent little to no time outside. Anyway after a month, I dedcided to do an inspection of the shoe to see if I had changes my stance (I have because all wear is on the front of my sole and my toes) and noticed a huge crack (all the way through the rubber sole to the inner footbed) on both shoes where the big toe pocket met the rest of the shoe. So I returned them only after a month and replaced them with the Vibram KomodoSport. I have owned them for a month and a half and I have used industrial strength super glue to glue the sole back on in areas multiple times. In addition there has been excessive wear on the sole of the rubber portion and there is a hole on the side of both shoes in the big toe pockets. I am about to return them one last time and try the Vibram TrekSport. I am just wondering if anyone else has these problems or if I am alone. I only run 1-2 mi a day on an INDOOR track and use them to just walk around in. My exercise routine is the power 90 if that makes any difference. That's all i have, im just looking for advice, comments, similar stories, etc.

EDIT: I weigh 145 lbs and am 5'-11"" and the shoes are size 43. They were purchased in store at an authorized dealer. Im trying to get a picture of their condition after a month of use.

EDIT 2:

The Holes http://i.imgur.com/hpVaH.jpg

EDIT 3: Initial purchase date was 2/13/11 for the KSO, and were replaced with the current KomodoSport on 3/11/11

EDIT 4 5/11/11: It seems like there is a mix of good and bad experiences. It also seems like the KSO is the most durable for some reason. I think I am going to return them to the store and get KSO.

I'm a relatively fit guy (28yr, 190 lbs, 6'2"") but running further than a 5k scared the bejezus out of me.  This was my goal to get into better shape and be less lazy.

After running for about a month in a pair of Brooks Glycerin 11s, I decided to do some research into barefooting.  Once I read Born to Run and starting reading Barefoot Running Step by Step (in addition to lurking here for a bit!) I became hooked on the idea of transitioning to become one of the unshod/minimalist runners I've been hearing so much about.  As a result, I drove over to the local REI in search of a minimalist pair of ""transition"" shoes.  They had a pair of Merrell Apollos on clearance from a few months ago.  Perfect!  I couldn't wait to give them a shot.  

Today after work I laced up and went for a 5k run around my normal path downtown.  I have been slowly working my way up to 10k over the past week and just finished a 5.8 mile run on Saturday.  I knew I needed to take it easy on my first run in these things, and figured an easy 5k jaunt around my building would suffice.

I was startled to feel the effect these shoes had on my stride.  Even within the first mile I could tell a significant difference, and loved every step of the way thereafter.  My shins are only mildly sore after the run.  To be honest, I was expecting to be walking half of the way after reading other runner's accounts of their transition into minimalist shoes.  I know I need to take it slow, and will probably run in my Brooks for my next run in my attempt to get to 10k.  I just couldn't be happier with the run.

Here are some of my thoughts:  
-It's exceptionally light and thin, so it is more or less completely unobtrusive. I would hazard a guess that it definitely won't make anything worse.  
-It's kind of annoying to put on. It can get bunched up and then it doesn't adhere properly. And if it's on a hairy part of your body, it is *exquisitely* painful to take off before the adhesive has completely worn out. I now have no hair on my ankles.  
-It definitely does *something* to your skin. It's not unpleasant, and I don't know if it's useful, but you can feel it pulling ever-so-slightly on your skin. Which is what it's supposed to do, to increase bloodflow to the affected area.

So I was browsing /r/running and someone tagged /r/barefootrunning in a post. Needless to say I was interested. 

I did my research on what my form should look like and practiced it around the house. I just so happens to already have a pair of VFF that I use camping for water shoes and whatnot so I was excited to actually use them for running. 

As I said I'm not much of a runner and when I do go running I like to stick to a 2 mile route by my house and after that I am usually exhausted. But this time I wasn't at my house. I was at my uncles house in the Texas hill country so I decided that I was just going to run on the highway till I got tired, and run back.    

I started my run. I was focused on my form so I didn't really pay much attention to the discomfort of running that I usually feel.(running mostly on asphalt) I made up the hills pretty easily and going down them was pretty fun  but around 10 min in to the run and my calves started to burn like they never have before.   So I stopped, stretched, and turned around for home.  The way home was way harder than I thought it would have been.   I had to take a few breaks to let my calves cool down. They felt like they were cramping up, but without the contracting feeling that a muscle cramp has. I finally make it home. I ran 3 miles and it took me 24 min(I'm not running for speed don't judge)    That was 2 days ago and walking is still pretty painful. I'm walking with a limp in both my legs and it looks pretty funny.  I know I went much too hard for my first run and I feel that I didn't injure myself so I'm not mad at myself. I'm just wondering if my next run should be shorter or of the same length?   I ran better than I ever have with shoes.  I think I know why people do this!   It feels free and natural , and I believe that it is letting me run to my full potential.  I know this was a long post but to those who read some of it I would like to thank you. I hope that I can continue running like this and I hope that I start to love running like y'all do.

Now, I know that I can't just go out and run 3/5/7 mile runs barefoot/in minimalist shoes with no training, which is why I come to you, /r/barefootrunning:

Is there a plan you recommend that gradually builds miles up to a half-marathon distance barefoot?

I had previously hated running and would always get shin splints and would do everything in my power to get out of running.  I also hated and never wore shoes, so VFFs were kind of a hook to try it out again.

My experience was much different than a decade previous, but was not without some stress injuries when I wouldn't pay attention to what my body was telling me.  Eventually I switched to running off road which pretty much did away with my injuries.

Currently I have been running 2-3 4mi runs a week with an occasional 6mi thrown in for fun.  I have also run a single 5k.  When discussing the upcoming ragnar with my team captain he was pretty skeptical about running 20mi over pavement in my vibrams (Bikila LS).  To verify to myself that I was not crazy for thinking about this I ran a 15K run on sidewalk / roads the next day and was pretty muscle sore but didn't experience any other issues.  I am about two weeks in and have been doing a 15K and two 10Ks a week without any issues other than muscle soreness.  At the end of a long run I might have a little knee stiffness and foot soreness but that ends pretty much when I stop running.

First, am I right that having never been capable of running in shoes now is a bad time to start?  Am I correct that given that my body seems capable now I am going to probably be able to continue this training regiment without injury (assuming I pay attention to my body)?  It seems like if people can run a paved marathon barefoot, I should be able to do less mileage with more time.  Any tips in preparing for this?

Thanks! 

**TL/DR**: Been preparing to run a 200mi relay race in my vibrams (I'm responsible for ~18mi of in three legs). Am I crazy?

I'm new to the minimalist/br scene and wanted to ask if anybody here on reddit has a hammertoe and is able to run without top of the foot pain? (for those unfamiliar.... http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hammer-claw-and-mallet-toes-topic-overview )  

As for a little bit more information, I started my barefooting escapades about three weeks ago, taking it very, very slowly as everybody always suggests (I'm a longtime lurker). Because of that I'd like to think it's not a TMTS injury. About two weeks into the running, I started to get some pain around the area of the flexor digitorum longus tendons close to my 2nd digit, which is where I have the hammertoe. I've taken the past week off and the pain did lessen with each day.  I've never had any problems in the past with any shoes ever and I've always played sports and ran.  Around 5-6 years ago I went to a podiatrist and he told me that the hammertoe looked like it was the result of having broken the toe at some point without me noticing (oops) and then it healed improperly.  I didn't opt for any surgery then because it wasn't too big a deal at the time. I'm currently a fit, 20yo Male with absolutely no problems with my left foot and no calf soreness anymore in either of my legs.

My hypothesis is that because I've had this hammertoe for so many years now, the tendons are kind of frozen and in a permanently flexed positions, so this new motion for my foot is irritating it a lot.  As a side note, I work in a physical therapy office and the therapists there thought that that could be the likely cause.

So if you've stuck with me for this long, I wanted to know what you all thought and if anybody had any opinions/similar experiences.  Could it be something with my running form? Will it possibly go away if my body starts getting used to the foot motion? Is my only real option at this point to go back to a podiatrist and have him recommend that surgery if I want to stick with barefoot running?  Let me know what you think.  Sorry for such a long post, thanks for reading, responding, and just being awesome! I appreciate it a lot

I'm also walking a great deal more as part of my daily commute (around three miles or so).  

I wear Merrell Trail Gloves as my daily shoe and love them to death - but they aren't going to cut it when walking through snow and ice.  Most of the minimalist shoe options out there share the same problems that the Merrells will have: low cut around the ankle and a breathable mesh.  Wonderful things in warm weather, but won't keep my feet dry when walking around the city when there's a foot of snow on the ground.

It seems like most of the winter discussion here [previously](http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/ed5e5/winter_minimal_shoes/) has centered around options for running, rather than extended walking (the boots that the OP linked in that thread seem to be out of production).  There's also been talk of [modding hiking boots with Vibram soles](http://naturallyengineered.com/blog/how-to-turn-your-thick-hiking-boots-into-minimalist-snow-shoes/) - which I wouldn't mind trying if there's nothing on the market that'll keep my feet dry in the snow without screwing up my biomechanics.

It pretty much feels like the beginning stages of pins and needles when you fall asleep on your arm. I am assuming it's because there is a lack of blood flow. Slowing down to a walk for just 30 seconds or so will usually rectify the problem. However, slowing down sometimes isn't an option in the later stages of the run in fear that after a slow down, I might not be able to pick my pace back up. I would much prefer to keep going at my jog pace the whole way through. Was wondering if anyone else here has ran into a similar issue, and if they found a solution to the problem. thanks guys!

Next trip was C25K day one, make it about 2/3's the way through and felt some pain in my calf so I stopped immediately. (Maybe 1.2 miles total, 1/2 walking)

Next trip (yesterday), made it through C25K day 1. (1.7 miles total, 1/2 of that walking)

Success! Well, not there yet but I think that clearly shows some progress. I'm noticing that I can feel the problems earlier and stop before they might become a real problem. My calves are still sore after a run, but in a muscle building kind of way instead of an injured kind of way.

One think I'm noticing is that now that my calves are getting stronger I'm transitioning into other new pains, most notably arch burn.

I have been minimalist running for a couple of years. I ran in Nike Free 3.0 for ages, but for the past couple of years I've mostly been running in my Luna Sandals. I have even done some barefooting. So I'm not entirely new to this, and I know all the reasons behind not using so called transition shoes....and I have no desire to go back to big shoes.

However...

Many, many months ago I injured my flexor hallicus longus and possibly some other stuff in my ankle/calf area. I've done all the right stuff re icing, resting, stretching, strengthening etc etc. But every time I tried running again it would cause issues. I stopped running for months. I still walked barefoot etc.

Finally I gave in and went to a podiatrist - found one who is a runner and is minimalist-friendly. Interestingly he told me I should have (after the initial rest) kept regularly running, but at a very low intensity. He has convinced me that the best way to rehab the area is to do regular short runs in some neutral, but ""traditional"" running shoes due to the restricted ankle movement.

This is where you guys come in...

I've tried a bunch of the recommended shoes and I don't really like any of them. Firstly most have that huge heel wedge. I can deal with that, as long as it's not over the top. Secondly the toe lift, I feel that's not neccessary and pushes my toes up. Thirdly, and probably most importantly, they all feel very restrictive in the toe box. I feel like to get one with enough toe/forefoot room I end up with a shoe that's too big. I've tried New Balance in the 2E and it's 'ok'. The store is getting in a 4E for me to try, but I'm not sure that's going to feel great either.

**TL; DR**
*Has anyone got any suggestions for a shoe that is semi-rigid in the ankle area, but isn't a big slab of old-fashioned thinking with a restrictive toe box??*

**EDIT:** Some great ideas here, thanks everyone! I hadn't really thought about the ankle brace. I have done a bit of strapping.

I just looked for this reddit because I thought there HAS to be one.  Here it is and here you all are... showing me how I'm not as hardcore as I thought (freakin barefoot runners).

Anyway.  Six months ago I started running as part of an overall fitness plan (the morning my -now ex- wife informed me that she would be leaving 'fatso' aka me.)  

I was pretty fat at the time, had not exercised or run in a very long time.  I was 207, my first run was about 1/4 mile.  Got home and was mocked by that fun lady I mentioned before.  Awesome start.

Honestly, I probably have her partially to thank for waking me from my dream-like state of life.  I now can say running gives me joy to such an extent as to only be #2 to my daughter.

Brutal. That is the word I would use to describe the process of getting everything right.  I ran a lot.  I ran out of anger.  I ran out of frustration.  I ran to show her what she was missing.  I ran to show myself what kind of person I am.

Eventually, as the runs began getting longer and the pain greater with the reward, I stopped running for anything except that I just had to fucking run.  

I started with a mid-foot shoe (a pair of kinvaras... still a really nice shoe over all).  As I moved to a true minimalist shoe, I had to humble myself before the great knowledge that like my weight, I'd been lying to myself about my shoe size.  A few blisters and one somewhat humbling realization later, I was wearing a very snug pair of fila skel-e-toes.

The process of developing the physiology as a pose runner was arduous and alternately frustrating and rewarding.  I discovered I had major balance issues in my lower leg strength, gait problems and the aforementioned self inflicted shoe issues.  I dealt with my problems as a cluster, with cross training.  

My running episodes started quite brief, so my cross training was meant to address the various weaknesses.  I would run as far as I could, when I got winded, I would typically do plyos or other speed set type bodyweight exercises.  A lot of ladders, jump squats, lunges etc... (I have been trained VERY aggressively before and had some experience to help me forward).  I would wrap up my short runs regularly with 20/10 high intensity interval sets.

Over the next couple months I went from 1/4 mile to very nearly 7 miles on my longer runs.  I had a lot of set backs, in retrospect primarily due to equipment problems.  I had an injury (stress fractured metatarsal) that set me back for about a month... I was able to run again 3 weeks ago.  It was fun (shitty) getting back on the wagon and finding that 2 miles was destroying me and I had to humble myself and start slowly.

I quickly jumped up to 4-5 mile runs and was defeated consistently by calf fatigue 3-4 miles into my runs.  I had some understanding that because my feet couldn't properly compress in my shoes, I was losing the key benefit of feet... namely shock absorption.  So I modified my shoes and I'm happy to say that yesterday I was able to run 8 miles without a single break, including the longest ascent of approximately 750 feet over 1.5 miles, which was a severe and awesome pain in the ass.

Anyway... I love minimalist running.  Discovering the forefoot compression thing made my day.  Oh and here is a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/KAT7b.jpg) of how I modified my shoes.  I basically just carved away enough padding in the arch so that my foot could bend.  Made a phenomenal difference.  

Overall down to 180 lbs, going to run a marathon next year. 

TL:DR I ran a lot and some stuff sucked, but it got better and I ran some more.

So for the past 3/4 of a year or so, i've been wearing minimalist or zero drop shoes all day long. I started running in merrell trail gloves back in January/February, and all of my trail runs at this point are in those shoes. I also wore them out and about on my daily excursions (work and play), until I decided to get some dedicated shoes. I bought some Sanuk board shoes (not minimalist, but zero drop), a pair of Lemings (http://www.lemingfootwear.com/), and a pair of Soft Star RunAmocs for ""dressy"" occasions. I also wore 5 fingers for a bit but they ended up not working out for me to well. 

I've noticed that when I walk totally barefoot, I use the fore/midfoot landing, but once I put on any sort of footwear (except socks), I automatically switch back to heel striking when I walk. It confuses me a bit since I still run with the proper landing. 

I also have noticed that standing barefoot for long periods of time doesn't hurt my feet, but putting on minimalist shoes and then standing for long periods hurts my heel. When I'm totally barefoot, I find that I put my weight more on the midsole and front of my foot, but again, when in shoes, I go back to my heel more. 

Lastly, I got into this whole minimalist thing after I had sprained my left ankle really bad last November. I decided to try something new and work on strengthening my ankles and feet. My right foot and ankle have been totally groovy. However, lately (past 2 months maybe it started to creep up), my right foot is sore when I just lay down or wake up from bed, but once I get moving through the day it kinda goes away. When I go running, it doesn't really bother me at all, and massaging it and touching it in places doesn't feel awkward or uncomfortable in the least bit. The arch of the left foot also tends to tighten up more, and I'm wondering if it's a result of the ankle sprain and the surrounding muscles. 

So basically, I'm wondering if anyone else wears minimalist shoes all day long, what they're using, and what your experience is with it. I'm also interested in someone explaining why minimalist shoes and barefoot are so drastically different in standing and walking.

I wear barefoot shoes at work (and have for years), and didn't have a problem with those, but the Mizuno's were a no go.

So, I started running barefoot. I've been doing about 2km of slow jogging combined with 2km of walking every other day. My calves are KILLING me, but I feel really good while I'm running. However, I'm not sure if my form is correct. I've read a lot of stuff online and watched a bunch of videos about correct form/posture and I *think* I have the basics down (lean slightly forward, keep your feet under you, up the cadence, etc.). The only thing I'm really confused about is the advice that I should ""lift my knees."" What does this mean? If I make a conscious effort to lift my knees, I feel like I'm doing the tire obstacle from basic training. It's weird. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Oh, and is it normal to feel faster barefoot? I can do a 8min/mile without shoes, but I average a 10 min/mile in my mizunos.

Working my way up again after a metatarsal break last fall, currently at 1/2 mile. I'm hitting a quick tempo, probably 180-200, and I notice a few things with moving as such.

I feel like my arms barely move, they just gently sway in counterbalance, per usual. However, they're *barely* moving, and I'm not sure if that's a problem. I'm not forcing anything and the lack of movement feels natural, just not sure if I should be forcing more movement from them.

Also, I land forefoot, and I don't feel like my knees are really getting very high. Are they supposed to? What I'm doing feels right and doesn't hurt, and I still like using the analogy of running on ice (in terms of pulling your feet off the ground instead of pushing off), but I'm not sure if I'm doing it wrong?

 I got into the shower with lukewarm water...it took a long time for my feet to warm up. As far as the skin goes, the feet seem fine today. I don't think I have any frostbite or anything.

I am young, have never had this problem before, and have been running in Vibrams for months. The increase that I went through in my mileage wasn't that steep either.

At the two weeks of rest mark, I went out hoping that maybe the pain wouldn't come back. Unfortunately it did, around 12 minutes into my run. As a last resort in the middle of the pain, I deliberately changed the way I landed on both my feet, from the midfoot landings I had been doing for a long time to a straight forefoot landing.

And bam, the knee pain ebbed away, I was able to run again with no problem. I felt like a wheelchair-bound person that had just gained the ability to walk. I am extraordinarily happy. I took it easy on that run because my calves ended up killing me from the change in form.

What I don't understand is why the way I was landing suddenly started being a problem when it was fine before, and why only one of my knees had a problem with it and not the other. I speculate that because the leg that didn't hurt has a slightly crooked foot, that it changed the strain that was being put on my knee.

TLDR: If your knee hurts, change the way you land on your feet, even if you have been running that way for a while. It may very well solve the issue!",,False,,t5_2rp0r,False,,,True,t3_hgzsq,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/hgzsq/sudden_knee_pain_after_weeks_of_running_with/,

I live in an urban area (northern NJ), and running the sidewalks and paths barefoot around here is not really a safe option because there's a lot of broken glass on the ground.

There's a park with an outdoor track about a mile and a half from my apartment, so lately I've been running there in my minimalist shoes and then taking them off to run barefoot around the track once I get there. I did that tonight, and after 6 laps around the track, park security stopped me while I was running and told me I could not run barefoot because of liability reasons. They said there could be broken glass on the track, so they would not allow me to run barefoot.

To avoid confrontation, I said Ok and put my kicks back on and finished my laps. But my question is this: can a public park regulate whether or not I have to wear shoes while I run? The posted park rules state nothing about wearing shoes. That park is really the only place close by where I can safely run barefoot, and I'd like to continue running there if possible.

Can anyone offer advice about how to deal with security if they stop me again, or maybe point me to some kind of barefoot runners' rights that I can print out and carry with me when I run? Thanks in advance.

Coincidence or common?,turkeypants,15,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/1b3ls5/been_running_totally_barefoot_for_a_year_with/,"I run on the beach, specifically on packed sand right by the tide's edge, not the soft loose stuff further inland. When I first started, I found that my feet would come near to cramping, which they never did out on the road. It felt like my feet wanted out of my shoes so I tried that. Running barefoot fixed the problem and felt great. 

The one problem I get is that after a few miles, a deep blister starts to form on the balls of my feet. You know how you can sort of feel it coming on before it has actually formed like it wants to. So I then have to lay off for several days or the better part of the week so it won't form. But I want to run most days, so that won't fly.

So while I didn't need any shoe, not even a minimalist one, I did need something to stop that blister so I could run more often. FiveFingers seemed to be the next best thing so I got some FiveFinger Bikilas.

After my very first run, I got a pain on the top of my left foot. It feels like tendon pain but could be muscle. It doesn't feel like bone pain. It's on the border between dull and sharp. If I flex my foot to move my toes upward, I feel it all along that tendon that goes from the big toe up to that last big joint. If I push and prod that area, it definitely feels like it's the tendon on top of that joint. It feels weak and hurts (not bad) and does not want to do that.

I understand people getting injuries when switching to barefoot or minimalist shoes when they're not used to it, but I have long been used to running barefoot on the beach. I'm only using it to prevent blisters, and the mechanics otherwise seem the same. But on my first day in FiveFingers this happened. So I laid off it for a couple days to let it heal and then ran in them again again and it happened again. It's not a terrible pain and is only activated if I flex it just right or run on it. But it's the kind of thing you want to rest so it doesn't get worse.

Have you guys heard of that particular injury with FiveFingers?

But when i want to wear them casually, all day or when i work which is for 12-13 hours, my feet dearly smell after about 6 hours in them. Is there any clue to wearing these bare without the smell for extended periods?
Basically i have found that washing the five fingers in the washer is worthless, they still stink. The best method ive found it to use simple green on the inside and soak them in some simple green + water and they smell nice for about 5-6 uses.
I just ordered 2 more pairs but i would like to wear them more often but I would like to fix the stink factor first, am i going to have to wear the socks?

*update* bought some injinin socks, no show, and lightweight, so im doing my first 12 hour shift, ill report weather or not they smell.

The lady at the shoe store and my friend both told me not to get minimalist running shoes as a beginner. I can't find anything online actually saying that's harmful besides the soreness I'd get (which i'd probably experience no matter what shoe i wore). Currently, I run a mile on a treadmill a few times a week to warm up for lifting. I wear Vans for these runs (my main sport for most of my life was swimming, so I never got myself proper exercise shoes). I tried on some cushioned running shoes at the store and quite honestly, they felt awkward and I didn't like how far away from the ground they felt. I actually think it would be BETTER to start with minimal shoes so I can practice good form early on. There's also the benefit of being able to lift weights with minimal shoes, but I don't mind lifting in vans either.

I also usually run in Brooks Adrenaline, so this will be one heck of a transition, anyway.

I don't have any planned races or anything until a half marathon in April 2013. I'm fully aware I may need to do that one in the Brooks.

I'm 6' and about 275 lbs right now, but I'm not really the typical fat guy.  For reference, I got down to about 230 a few years ago after I was in Africa for the summer, and could see a bit of abs at that point, but couldn't maintain that weight for long.  

Two summers ago I trained up and did a half marathon and an olympic distance triathalon, so those were great, but I could never get rid of shin splints (I was about 260 lbs at that point for reference).  I was on ibuprofen around the clock, and after a run I could barely walk the rest of the day.  I've tried everything.  I've tried orthotics, shoe fittings, barefoot, ice rubdowns, freezing showers after running, etc.  Hell, I even tried rubbing banana peels on my shins because I heard somebody online swear by it (something to do with potassium helping).  


I've been running barefoot because I love the feel of it, and I really enjoy it, but I still probably can't even do a mile without ibuprofen.  Even if I do take the meds, my shins still bother me after the run.  I don't really want to be on a 24/7 ibuprofen regimen, so does anyone have any ideas of things that could help?  I gave up on my dream of marathoning two summers ago because of this, and I'm about to give up running altogether if I can't figure this out.  I really love running and just getting in the zone and kind of meditating while I run, and I love the health benefits, but having my shins kill me all the time is just not worth it anymore.

My barefoot form seems to be developing well - no pain in feet, achilles, or calves, but when I run in the MR10s lately I've been feeling some tenderness in my heels and mild soreness in my achilles. I'm starting to think this is caused by the 5mm drop from heel to toe. It seems that the extra cushioning in the heel prevents my foot from landing the way it should and my heel strikes the ground a little too soon (I'm definitely not striking first with my heel but it feels like it hits earlier than it does when I'm fully barefoot). Once my heel starts to feel a little tender, I overcompensate by landing further forward towards my toes and that causes the achilles soreness.

I'm wondering if my feet simply land a bit heavier when running with the shoes and this is my heel getting used to that, or if the 5mm drop is actually hindering my natural form. I'm starting to think I should try to MR00s instead and see how those feel. I likely would have chosen them from the start but I bought the MR10s before the zero drops were available and don't really want to buy another pair of shoes yet.

I'm hoping to get some opinions here on the difference between zero drops and 4-5mm drops and how form might be affected.

* Started running again with the C25K program after not running for the past 5 years. 
* Was in ""normal"" shoes for 2 weeks with horrible shin splints and my heel getting rubbed raw by the back of my shoes (more than likely a haglund's deformity, that's my own internet diagnosis). 
* Read about minimalist running and the benefits seemed to be just what I was looking for. 
* (background, I don't wear a lot of heeled shoes. In the summer I rarely wear shoes, usually flip flops or barefoot...Been that way since I can remember.)
* I purchased a pair of NB 730s. They were great. Especially since they're light and don't have the plastic heel support in the back to rub against my heel.
* I restarted the C25K program because all the ""transition guides"" say to start slow. I figured it would be a great way to start with new minimalist-ish shoes. 
* Almost immediately my calves and Achilles were really tight. After further research I understood this to mean 1) I wasn't stretching enough and 2) I was using new muscles and of course they're going to be tight. 
* I do eccentric calf stretches every day, usually twice a day, to strengthen my calves and stretch out my achilles.  
* I'm still working on my form, which is getting better every day. The best day I had was last week when I was really relaxed and bent my knees a little more than usual. Almost no ""pain"" and I wasn't as tight as I usually am. I've tried to recreate that day, but have not succeeded yet. :-)
* Now, I'm almost done with week 5 of the program (have been redoing days/weeks here and there) and I'm still dealing with sore calves and Achilles (it's mostly my achilles...my calves are just tight but neither is exactly painful). 
* The odd thing is: they only ""hurt"" (again, just super tight, not really painful) when I'm running. After I stretch and ice them I'm fine for the rest of the day. 

Now my question is: Is this normal? It seems to be better some days, and that could be due to my form (which isn't consistent, yet...). Are there other stretches I could be doing? Will foam rolling help? (I don't own a foam roller, but I do have plenty of water bottles and NERF &amp; tennis balls to do the job.) How long will it be uncomfortable? I'd like to be able to run more than 8 minutes without my legs getting too tight (that's about my limit now, of course in the beginning 60 seconds was my limit, so... *shrug*). 

I guess I'm just looking for some solid advice and guidance.

PS: I don't want to go barefoot. I plan to stay in shoes. Thanks.

I've been running for ~2 years. I started with 1x/week (2-3 mi) for a year, and have slowly increased my frequency and mileage in the last year. Now I'm training for a half marathon that will be in mid-march. 

I bought some VFFs last month. I'd been running in some ""marshmallow"" Mizunos that, at the time I made this purchase, I already knew were probably on their way out. But I figured they would take me through my half and then I could transition to the VFFs when distance wasn't as much of a priority for me. In the meantime, I thought a few (short!) runs in the VFFs would be good cross training. 

So this is where I got myself in a bind. I love the VFFs! My old shoes are painful and awkward in comparison (I've always had a forefoot strike), and I've started having pain during/after running which has never been a problem before (shin splints on the lower inside of both legs, achilles stiffness, etc). I can't seem to figure out if my old shoes are finally shot, or if the few runs I've done with the VFFs (.25mi, .5mi, then 1.5mi - all pain free) are to blame. I'd really rather not spend $100 to buy new Mizunos only to put them on the shelf after this half, so I'm left with terrible options all around. (1) Bail on the race (2) Run the race in the old shoes (3) Go against all advice and run in the vibrams.

(1) I'm now incapable of starting a run at a fast pace.  My legs need a good mile to attain the range of motion I need to run with pace.

The logical part of me as well as other redditors were saying it was a stupid idea, being that I hadn't trained in them at all (and I'm also not a runner).  However, my instincts were telling me it was going to be okay.  And it was!  I could not imagine running, hiking, climbing, and completing obstacle courses over 12 miles with anything on other than Vibrams.  Shoes are too clunky for me and feel like I have a better chance of twisting my ankles that way than in Vibrams when I was running on and over big rocks.  I felt like a deer sprinting through the forest moving with ease and loved the feeling the rocks, snow, water, and mud beneath my feet.  Although there were a few others that I saw running in Vibrams, I still got many comments from strangers saying how it was pretty extreme and asking how my barefoot shoes are.

A couple of people in my group of 12 got some cramps in their calves along the way and so did many others doing the course.  A few of them also had a lot of knee pain within the last few miles.  I had no cramps or pain the entire way and even felt like I could do some more miles after finishing.  Today I am a little sore but probably not more than anyone else who has completed this challenge.

I understand I am an outlier, that I'm just an exception not the rule.  I don't recommend any beginners with Vibrams to do what I did and believe I was able to get away with it due to my gymnastics history and working out barefoot as much as possible.  Anyway, thanks for everyone's input in my last post :)

I'm FLAT FOOTED, so I try to soft land as much as possible. Well, recently about a month and a half ago my knees were just hurting too much (and somewhat my feet) to where I couldn't continue. I took 2 weeks off, felt better tried again and could only go a mile. So far I've been on a break for almost 2 months, in this time I've just been doing p90x stuff to work out and get my leg used to exercise. 

So basically, my friend gets a pair of vibrams (not sure the model) and says he has NO pain in his knees and just tells me to get them and start running again. I'm pretty skeptical to buy them, but here are things that I'm wondering.

* I am flat footed, does this matter?
* I would only use these for running but I know a lot of you use them for everyday purposes - is this an all day kind of shoe?
* Any specific model I should go with?

In any case, thanks for the help with whatever answer you can give me. I stumbled on this subreddit recently and I really do miss running so I thought I'd just give it a go and post here with my concerns! 

Thanks!


**UPDATE** If anyone reads this... Just wanted to say I got the Vibram FiveFingers Bikila LS Running Shoes last week! At first they were somewhat awkward, also learned that my left foots pinky toe and whatever ones next to that is a little bit shorter then they are on the right foot... Hah

I went running and immediately noticed I could go faster, but I reverted to my normal pace anyways because I know you have to slowly ease into these shoes.

I didn't run out of breath as fast, I dunno if that's linked or anything but I noticed it! 

I got to about 2 miles when I noticed these new muscles that I never used before started to ache. Not a bad ache, just a workout ache. So I went home, took off the shoes and realized I had NO KNEE PAINS WHAT SO EVER. Also I could feel a better arch when I wore them. The next 5 days were me barely moving though... Seriously those atrophied muscles had their first work out and I could NOT move. Luckily I work from home, otherwise it would of sucked. My legs are finally recovered and I'm thinking about go on another mile run today! These shoes are AWESOME.

My friend suggested I try on the New Balance Minimus (they were the WT10KB2, which after checking online looks like the Minimus 10V2 Trail. They were extremely comfortable, but seemed like maybe they were a little too cushiony (it was very comfortable, but I'm worried it would allow for poor form). Sure enough, they have a 4mm drop. So, I checked out the other NB shoes online, and the Minimus Zero and Minimus Zero Trail both look good, but the reviews indicate they form holes after a few months of use, and I'm worried they might still be too cushiony. 

I would actually ideally like to run completely barefoot, but I live in Iowa, so I will definitely need something for the winter and possibly the summer when it's really warm outside, and my feet are taking longer for the skin to toughen than I would like. :-) 

Does anyone have any recommendations for a sole flexibility similar to the NB minimus, but maybe with a little bit more of a barefoot feel? Also, I'm a girl, but male recommendations may be helpful as well. Pretty much, I will be running on paved/grassy surfaces (think neighborhood), but eventually might like to branch out to trails of some sort. I did check the FAQs, but the websites for the different barefoot shoes are overwhelming and don't really give me an idea for how the shoes truly fit and feel. 

Sorry if this is the billionth post of this type, but as a girl, it seems a little harder for me to find relevant threads. Please, of course, post links to any that you know of.

What I've been doing is using a pair of Vibrams (Spyridons) as I ease into C25K. Basically I've been doing C25K but at a slightly slower pace, so instead of 3 runs per week, 2 runs a week. I've been wearing my Vibrams at the gym for other workout purposes (mainly lifting).

For the first two weeks of C25K things were going fine, no real pain or anything on my runs.

At the start of week 3 though, I noticed some pain around my shins and the back of my left foot/achilles area during the run. I decided to stop mid-way before pushing forward.

Any idea what could be causing this? I was thinking it may be due to my leg muscles being strained -- a few nights ago I went to a concert and was wearing some uncomfortable boots, which coupled with standing for 2 hrs straight made my legs pretty sore. 

The other thought I had was maybe my form is getting messed up, but I've been trying to make sure that I hit the ground on my midsole and keep my toes down (I used to be striking more with my forefoot and had a tendency to raise my toes before).

The only other issue I think might be causing it is a lack of stretching beforehand. Any suggestions for that?

Not sure what to do now--do I run a little bit every day and hope I acclimate? Do I bail on my VFFs and buy my first pair of ""regular"" shoes in 4 years? See if I can power through the long run this weekend? Cancel the half marathon and become a professional couch potato?

Maybe the cost of the leather went up enough that they couldn’t retain a reasonable price in the years to come? Maybe sales were lower because this was one of the most expensive models?

I can speculate all day, but does anyone know the real reason they discontinued an excellent model?",,False,,t5_2rp0r,False,,,True,t3_19mbyj,http://www.reddit.com/r/BarefootRunning/comments/19mbyj/vff_leather_models/,

Obviously I want to avoid a heavy heel strike like you do with regular shoes, and I understand that concept, but when they say forefoot striking, does that mean that I should basically be running on my toes as if I were hopping around with my heels barely touching the ground, or does it just mean the ball of your foot should be the first thing to touch the ground, even if it's just for a quick second and then your whole foot lands flat very shortly after? 

I noticed that when I stop trying to make sure I am staying on the balls of my feet or avoiding a heavy heel strike, I will kind of land flat footed, as if the whole foot was striking the ground, but with my heel not being the first thing to hit the ground. Is this the normal landing? It felt much more natural to me than concentrating on landing on the ball of my foot or the heel, but I've heard in the past you shouldn't be ""slapping"" the ground with your foot.

So this is really bumming me out, and I'm looking into any way I can correct this.

Not sure how the deviation developed or when, but my left foot's slightly misshapen. Maybe my stressful, sandal-wearing year away from exercise caused the problem or worsened an existing deviation? Anyway the midfoot doesn't bear weight properly anymore, my foot still functions like a foot but it throws the leg into misalignment when I run, barefoot or otherwise.

[Here's a picture](http://www.imgur.com/P20yY), the foot on your right's actually my left foot. The worst problem is not visible from this angle, and really hard to show from any other angle, but basically the inward ball of my midfoot (where the big toe emerges) protrudes down very slightly and bears more weight. If I let the whole midfoot rest on the ground my ankle rolls outward and I can't apply force straight into the ground.

Is there any way I can slowly move this big toe back into alignment? You can see how funky it looks, and it feels a little funky too. I've seen various elastic foot-braces and other equipment designed to gradually alter a foot's shape, but nothing designed for this specific deviation.

But when it’s too cold, too much gravel on the road or I want to go really fast – I need some protection.  For this I use a pair of Vivo Barefoot EVO running minimalist shoes. After a couple of runs in them I start to get a pain in my ankle. When I switch back to barefoot, the pain goes away. Its obvious to me that my form is better when I run barefoot than when I run in the EVOs. 

Pete Larson found similar evidence when he secretly filmed runners in the NYC barefoot run. A lot of people in minimalist shoes where still heel-striking! I am pretty sure that I don’t heel-strike in my EVOs, but none the less, my form is worse. 

Barefoot Bob said that minimalist shoes are just really really bad shoes. We should all go barefoot. 
Barefoot Bob lives in California and has a lifestyle that allows year- round barefoot running. Most of us don’t. A lot of us need some protection (see my reasons above). 

Now, I have not had a pair of regular running shoes for years. But I want to test if a lightweight shoe with some padding, and close to zero drop, is a better alternative than minimalist footwear. 

I still try to do the majority of my runs barefoot, but when I wear a shoe, I want it to be a good one. 

I know that the Tarahumara Indians use a minimalist sandal. But remember that they already have, and never lost their good form. I learned to be a heel-striker in my youth, and apparently I am still trying to relearn my body how to run correctly.

1. I have no calf-pain whatsoever. No sore thighs or anything other than the skin of my feet. I normally do bodyweight squats, so maybe that's it but I'm curious: *is this because my mileage is still fairly low or are the squats useful?*

2. When I'm BRing (I run on asphalt/pavement - kind of painful at first but i feel it when i do something wrong. i.e. land on my heels:( )I focus on landing on my midfoot moving to heels.

Will my form naturally improve with time if I continue being aware and running hard asphalt? 

***Background:*** 

I began running July2011 with C25K. Ran in thick heavy shoes :( No problem as my mileage is low. Track season begins March 2011, I go from 10-20 miles a week to 30-40.

I toss the shoes, and stopped running for a week and half and after hearing about it i decide to go barefoot. 

***Present:***

**Yesterday:** I had my first barefoot run, I ran about half a mile/ 5-6 mins. I focused on midfoot striking and SQUB (Silent, quick, upright, no bobble-head). I still felt the injury so I took it easy, no pains or anything other than sore skin (which is normal).
