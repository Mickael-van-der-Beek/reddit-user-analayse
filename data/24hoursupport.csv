",piranha-pool,86,17,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/184g3s/my_reddit_account_of_3_years_and_other/,"I was trying to download a streaming movie/tv service (not netflix) and I got hijacked by something called Delta Search. When it kicked in, it replaced Chrome as the default browser.  After several hours of struggle, I thought I got rid of it and got Chrome back as default, but I found that I couldn't sign in to google and had to replace my password.

Next I try to log into reddit, and it tells me that there is no account  with my 3-year username, and that it is available for registration.  So I registered under piranha-pool again. I'm not worried about lost Karma, but I really am pissed at the loss of my account, and the fact that I lost my three year award attached to it and appear to be a new user.

Has anyone else experienced Delta Search?  How did you get rid of it, and how did it affect your internet experience?

We had someone request the addition of status tags to posts to make it easier to keep track of who still needs help, so I made the list in the sidebar and had all new posts start with a default ""unresolved"" status. We also had a few requests for the creation of a wiki, which was added soon after the requests.

I think we're in pretty good shape now, but would like to know what you guys think, and if there's any other ideas on ways we can improve to make the subreddit more efficient and easier to use, or to get people help quicker.

Special thanks to those who hang out in the chat room helping people out.

When I tried to open the document that he sent me on his extended deadline, however, two different Mac computers were unable to open the file. I believe he did something like opening a word document in Notepad, deleting some lines, and re-saving what is now an unreadable file [as suggested on posts like these](http://cheezburger.com/4641426688). Is there an easy way to recover the text of his original file? I would assume that gibberish produced when one opens an MS Word file in Notepad/TextEdit is pretty much the same between most documents. My current plan is to create a file with distinctive text (Fluffy Bunny) and use text-matching to determine a) what was deleted, and b) how the text is represented in the symbols so that I can a) feel confident confronting him about it, and b) hopefully figure out what text his document contained before corruption.

I was hesitant because IRC isn't as user friendly, but I know a lot of techies have it running 24/7, so we're more likely to have people in the chatroom to help others if we go with IRC.

I set up the new browser based version on webchat.freenode.net which several other subreddits use. It's the simplest one I could find, as far as user interface and ease of use. If anyone knows of anything even simpler, or more user friendly than that, post it in the comments below so I can try them out.

We highly recommend you **use the same username** in chat as you do on Reddit, to keep things simple. If you help someone in chat and they have a quick follow up question, they can just PM you on Reddit later if you use the same username in chat.

You can also register your username in the chat with a password and email verification using this command

##System Specs
* Acer Aspire One D255
* W7 Basic

----

**Issue:** User forgot the Windows 7 Basic Admin password. I attempted to help assist by a simple reformat. To do this, I need to rearrange the boot priorities to USB. The BIOS has a password.

**The real problem:** I am not able to run any software on any boot element since the BIOS is not accessible. I am not able to run any software on the desktop because it is not accessible.

----

##Attempts

* Try basic PW guessing
* Opened up netbook to disassemble CMOS battery. Soldered on
* Read that CMOS battery won't help, BIOS is stored differently
* Downloaded BIOS' flashit.exe &amp; .fd file, Fn+Esc w/ Power. didn't work. (I made sure to format FAT or FAT16)
* Cannot find a hash code of failed BIOS attempts to translate password
* Shot a rubberband at the screen

----

All out of ideas. Have I missed something? (excluded obvious attempts as I cannot get on the desktop  or BIOS options).

I got this laptop off craigslist almost a year ago. I traded some things and a bit of money for it. My model is an Asus G53JW Republic of Gamers [laptop](https://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/G53Jw). This was my first gaming laptop and loved it. However there was a small problem with the charging port. The prong inside was loose. Eventually it snapped off and I paid about $40 to a local PC repairman to solder another port back on and have it work again.

However..

The problem started happening again and it became loose a few weeks ago. It still worked if I moved it in the appropriate position for charging, but just last night, I moved the charger inside a bit and hurt something burning. I quickly pulled the charger out and saw smoke. I slowly put it back in after about 15 minutes of waiting to see what exactly was going on, and a flame sparked inside for a quick second. I haven't touched my laptop since.

I'm a broke senior in highschool and have no idea what to do. Would Asus be able to replace this by any small chance? I need this computer for my graphic designing and am really out of luck.

I just got done finishing my build and I left the case open then I connected my keyboard, mouse, monitor and power then I pressed the power button, heard silence and saw smoke. I panicked and unplugged the cord so quickly I cut myself badly on my thumb hitting an edge of the case.

I don't know where the smoke came from but nothing powered up no fan or nothing. When I pressed the power button all I saw was smoke and I quickly unplugged the cord.

The power supply I was previously using on my previous computer and it's been working completely fine. I used standoffs. I'm sitting here tearing up and dumbfounded as to what went wrong. I see no blown capacitors on the motherboard however I believe I see some burnt on the power supply.

After I recorded the video I remembered that the first time I put it together I connected the case fan to CPU fan 2 instead of CHA Fan 3. Was that what fucked everything up? Was such a simple careless mistake it? fucking fuck.

Was the power supply I used not suitable for my motherboard or something?

Fuck me man. What the fuck did I do wrong because this powersupply was working before. how did this massive failure I call myself fuck up? I can't fucking do anything right. Why the fuck did I even try? What fucking good am I.

Are the rest of my parts fried? What are my options?

Anyway, I would really like to not uninstall half of my computer to find out if it's been fixed or not, especially since my ex installed all of my programs years ago for me and I have no idea which were obtained legally or not. I'm going to have to uninstall any program that was installed by him, which is pretty much everything. --sigh--

I have all the logs from OTL EEK and combofix... I just don't know how to read them. Hoping someone on good old reddit can help me out.

**Edit:** as several of you have suggested, I'm going to reinstall the OS. I was panicking for a bit last night as I realised that my system did not come with discs to reset the system back to the factory settings but user morphius501 pointed out to me that I have a partition specifically for that. He is my new hero! This will work out perfect as I was needing to clean up my computer anyway or hunker down and save up to buy a new one. I will save my files and reinstall tonight. Will report back later with results. Hopefully it will go swimmingly. Thank you so much for all the suggestions!!

**Edit2:** Huzzah! Success! I have reset the system back to factory settings and the system is running much better than before. It wasn't even that difficult to back up my files (although I missed a few things like saving my bookmarks silly me) and it was restored within 2 hours. I have made a set of recovery discs now and have scanned the system thrice over with Avast Boot Time Scan and Hitman. 

I'd like to thank everyone here who gave me some solid advice. I knew Reddit would be able to help me better than that forum. You guys rock!

I just build my new PC and had some issues with installing windows. Nothing big, just ended up reformatting all the old HDDs I kept from the old rig and installed again on a new clean SSD.  

I saved all media files and such on a 500gb external HDD which was plugged in, but (as far I think) was left untouched during the installation. Now, for some reason the External shows up as having 1.38mb total space and 169kb free. I'm guessing that somewhere in configuring OEMs and partitions it got involved but I cannot for the life of my figure out how to undo it.  

It's a Buffalo ministation external and a ASrock z68 Extreme 3 Gen3 Mobo, if that makes a difference.

I thought I've seen it all, but THIS problem has shown me that in I.T., there's always something you don't know.

Situation: The girl sitting across from me showed me that her mouse cursor on her desktop PC has been hijacked.  These aren't random movements.  The person controlling the mouse clicks the IE addr bar and types out URLS, tried to move/delete Outlook folders, opens Outlook messages tries to delete them, and worst of all, tried to sign up this girl for Viagra emails (by clicking an ad in the right-hand pane).  We had to fight for control of the mouse!

Troubleshooting: I checked for malware; none found (I've cleaned so many computers of malware I'd say I'm almost an expert at it).  Made sure McAfee was updated (it was), and installed MS Security Essentials.  No non-standard programs installed.  Used AutoRuns to see if there's something hiding, found nothing.  Here's where it gets strange: I disconnected the Ethernet cable and the mouse was STILL moving.  There is no wireless card in this desktop.  Ok, that narrows it down to the wireless mouse and keyboard.  I take out the wireless receiver for the Microsoft Mouse, and the cursor still moves.  I take out the receiver for the wireless Logitech keyboard, and the cursor movement stops.  Ok, bluetooth's range is only 30 feet, hmmmm....

Known facts: No one in our business is hacking this computer, because I can see everyone, and I walked around to see if this was a joke.  We even made everyone take their hands off their mouse while the mouse was hijacked, to no avail.  No one at this business is sophisticated enough to pull this off; especially without laughing.  One time it happened and everyone was at lunch, so I know it's no one here at work.  We are on the top floor, so there's no one above us.  There is a company below us, but we went down there and they were closed that day.  Beyond that, it's a textile showroom anyway, so there aren't any PC's within 30 ft of this girl's desktop.  When we close the blinds behind this girl, the mouse activity stops.  The hijack has occurred on several different days, usually a week or two apart.

Question for you all, and yes I know how crazy it sounds: Is it possible to hack together a super bluetooth transmitter/receiver so someone can control the desktop from across the street (or farther)?  I know that sounds nuts, but it's my only possible explanation.  This desktop has no other peripherals connected besides the mouse/keyboard/monitor, and as I said earlier, it still happens with the Ethernet cable completely pulled.  If someone COULD pull off a bluetooth hack at this level, would it even go through their windows AND ours?  Seems so unlikely.

In the meantime, I've set her up with a wired mouse/keyboard.

I am a technological midget.  I know how to use my computer to browse the internet for reddit and for porn, sometimes both at the same time, and that's about it.

I'm moving in with a roommate who is very computer savvy.

And while I think it's unlikely that he would even care enough to monitor the router traffic, I know this is a possible thing to do.

Questions:
1. Can he only see connections as they happen or can he view logs?  Can he see the files I download over bittorrent?
2.  Is there anything I can do to increase my privacy?

So.. I'm going to use the same internet provider for tv etc so you know.

My options;

Tele2 - Can offer me 150-250mbit/30-50mbit CABLE + tv,phone for 50 euro / month.

Telia - 100/10 or 100/100 FIBER + tv, phone for 50 euro / 55 euro / month

What do I use my internet for?:
Some downloading, mostly TV Shows and .flac music (Through waffles.fm)
Gaming (LoL, BF3 etc).

My GF uses it for Origin downloads (Reinstalling her The Sims quite often).


But what would you pick and why?

Next came the CPU, I took out my old CPU, and AMD Phenom II 2.7ghz cpu i bought years ago and put in my new AM3+ 4.0GHZ CPU in, the installation went fine and i put my new water cooler from corsair ontop of it with only a little smudging of that grey stuff.
So i turn on my computer and BAM, no signal from the monitor, the lights on the keyboard and mouse don't light up as well. There are no beeps when it turns on, the fans and internal LEDs are all running but I'm getting nothing from the rest.


I tried booting it with no ram inside and received no beeps. I re-installed my old CPU and got the same result from my computer, no beeps and no lights or picture.

I have set it back to its original config, unfortunately however, the problem remains and I cannot get any signal from the monitor, keyboard, or mouse.

**EDIT:** 
Ok, so here is where I am at. I ran through all the tests for the motherboard and it in infact shorted. THE CPU was faulty to beign with which caused the damage to the system.

* The temperature readings are fine, CPU temp is around 40-50 degrees celsius, which is OK for an i5 2500k. 

* Booting up in Safe Mode doesn't make the system reset itself.

* I tried re-installing Windows, however at the last step where the installer boots up the OS, the same thing happens.

Currently I'm thinking of doing a memtest, however any advice is appreciated.

Thanks in advance :)

---

***EDIT***

**New Info:**

* I formatted the PC, and now I can't install Windows on it. It freezes at ""System is preparing the registry"" stage, where Windows is about to boot, and the glowing Windows logo is seen. I don't even know if this is related to my original problem, and I'm stuck.

* Tried connecting a new GPU, above problem persists.

* Currently booted up the Live version of Linux Mint from the disk, it works without a problem. However, I can't install it because it gives Input/Output Error. Currently doing a 'fsck' to check for bad HDD blocks.

I think either the HDD or the Power Supply is the problem. However, being able to run Linux from the live disk pretty much rules the Power Supply out. Is there any way I can test the other parts of the PC while on a live OS?

(cannot handle more than 1 graphics card, frequent crashing and BSODs)[](/broke)",lleti,11,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/sgj84/built_my_first_pc_its_now_mostly_a_6k_paperweight/,"So, long story short - I saved up for a long while, and could finally build what I dubbed my dream PC. The setup was;

Asus p9x79 Pro motherboard

i7 3930K cpu

32GB DDR3 (Ripjawz 1600mhz, 8x 4GB)

H80 Cooling

2x GTX590 SLI

Corsair 240GB 6gbit/s SSD

2TB WD

Corsair AX1200 PSU

Thermaltake Level10 casing


Now, on the initial build, I left out 4 sticks of RAM - as when I mounted the H80, I realised I'd have to take it back out to put the RAM into the slots behind it.. and well, I was getting pretty tired.

I connected up everything else, and away we went. First problem I noticed was the mounted fan I put over the RAM (A Geil Cyclone) was only running at around 2000rpm, wheras it's meant to run closer to 4000. This isn't a fan that kicks up when it's under load, it's just a constant speed - Nevertheless, the temp was reading at about 18' C, so I wasn't too bothered about it.

Everything else went fine - after a bit of wiggling around, we passed POST and we were raring to go. Unfortunately, the problems started shortly after. Once both Windows and Drivers were installed, I of course, began overclocking. I used the Asus AI Suite to do this for me, and got up to 4.7ghz out of the cpu. I probably could have gotton it higher if I did it manually, but at the same time this was more than suitable for me - and I was looking to start the benchmarking process, of course.

The system started locking up around this time - sometimes during a benchmark, sometimes when the PC was on idle. Also some odd glitches such as pink screens, graphical issues, etc etc. First thoughts being graphics card, I removed one of the GTX590's, and things started going smoothly. Rang dabs and they were happy to refund it.

Now, from there, the problems continued in gaming, or when the machine was under load - often during a game of starcraft2 (or anything that was pushing the card), the display would stop receiving a signal, and the audio would start skipping, until a hard reboot was done. Event log was showing Kernel-Power as the issue. One, the PC managed to recover - and displayed a warning stating that the Nvidia kernel had stopped responding, and was recovered. So, I assumed, another fucked graphics card. With this, whenever the system crashed, it would show up with ""Overclocking failed!"" during boot, forcing me to re-do the UEFI Process. After a few of these crashes, I set the CPU back to it's stock speed, incase that was the issue.

I said fuck it, and ordered up 2 new GTX 680's last week. Of course, before this, I did ensure to try with different drivers (rollbacks, stable, and beta drivers - ensuring not to install that bloody HD Audio Driver).

New cards arrived, so I decided to throw the rest of the RAM in while I was at it. After this, the System failed POST, showing up Q-Code 69 (System Agent DXE initialization is started). Now, the odd thing is that when this happened, for the first time ever, the Cyclone fan mounted on the RAM actually spun up to 4200rpm, and remained stable there.

Process of elimination started, and I found the system would only pass POST if the RAM Sticks were not connected.

Finally, into Windows - installed the newest drivers from nvidia.com (I of course removed the old drivers and used driversweep to clear out any remnants), and the crashes started; very constantly. The PC would normally completely lock during/just after the windows logon screen. At times, the PC wouldn't completely lock, but would freeze up for 5 seconds, respond for a second, freeze up again.. etc etc, leading to a hard reboot. I started the process of again trying every driver available, to no avail. At one point, I got an actual error message out of it; ""Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered."".

So, after a restless night of sleep, I woke up today and went back at it - and found I'm now back to the same old ""stability"" when I'm running on a standalone GTX680.

So, the question is - what exactly is fucked, or are there any further tests I can do on this?",,False,,t5_2rv00,False,,,True,t3_sgj84,http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/sgj84/built_my_first_pc_its_now_mostly_a_6k_paperweight/,

What is going wrong:

1: The Built-in graphics of the CPU (i7 3770k Intel HD 4000) does not work.

2: PCIe 16x_2 (the second slot for a graphics card) does not work    

 

Problem 1: When I plug in a screen via a DVI, VGA or HDMI to the 
Mobo it does not display anything. 

What I have tried: 

-Tried multiple screens, cords and TVs. No combination works

-Booted the system with no graphics card installed using the HDMI port on the mobo, nothing displayed. Also tried VGA, DVI and all three on another monitor.

-Tried to select the CPU graphics as the primary graphics in my bios (under system agent conguration). The iGPU Option is missing when it was present before.

-Restored Bios settings to the default settings, no dice

-Re-installed/Flashed the BIOS, No change, iGPU option still missing

-re-seated the CPU, did not note any bent pins and/or damage to CPU or Mobo socket    

 

Problem 2: PCIe 16x_2 slot does not work/ computer does not recognize any graphics card plugged in. Both cards power up (fans spinning)

What I tried:

-switched the graphics cards places on the mobo, only the card in the first PCIe slot worked.

-Booted with only one 670 at a time in the first slot, both worked fine. Tried the same in the second PCIe slot, no dice for both.

-double checked the SLI bridge placement, proper seating of both cards and the power supplies for both cards. 2nd card still not showing up.

I am very upset this system is not working after performing so well  for 3 months. It stopped working randomly after no hardware or software changes. I would love any help or fresh ideas. Thank you! 

I just discovered this reddit and will try to pay any help forward by helping others out here.

Does a VPN really allow you to anonymously use the Internet, download, stream, ect? Will a VPN cripple my connection speed? Who/what will be able to see my computer, history, and traffic (hackers, ISP, network intruders)? Will this work when I’m not on my home network (if I'm on a public network, friend’s network, using a mobile hotspot)? Do I set this up on my computer or my router? 

I'm not looking to do anything nefarious or legal I'm just realizing how lax my security is, also I'm tired of getting my computer hacked. Twice someone has accessed to my built-in WebCam, luckily I caught the intrusions early and took care of the problem but I want to make sure this doesn't happen again. I'm also generally concerned about being tracked online, I'm not worried that the government is watching me I'm worried everyone else is (ISP, websites, databases). I do have an antivirus and anti-malware program on my computer I keep them updated and run scans regularly but I'm now realizing that this is not enough and I know I’m little late to the game.

Malwarebytes
Windows provided firewall

* *Nothing* on the hardware side (or the software side for that matter) has changed except the CPU cooler.

* I have had all of my hardware detached and attached to my motherboard a few times due to mounting issues, though.
* [Windows knows there is more than 4 GB (excuse the Danish)](http://i.imgur.com/YqQa8.png)
* [I ran Memtest86+](http://i.imgur.com/eip8v.jpg). It, too, recognizes all 6 slots of 2048 MB and the correct Triple Channel configuration. **However** if you notice at the top right, it says ""Memory: 4094M""!
* Memtest successfully ran a full pass with no errors.
* [Advanced boot settings](http://i.imgur.com/gnS5P.png) (again, excuse the Danish). I did try to clear the ""Maximum memory"" check box, which didn't help, and I did try to set it to maximum amount (12228), which didn't help either.
* **[This is my Resource Monitor](http://i.imgur.com/mF5VK.png)**. It reports 8-something GB is reserved for hardware. That appears to be the issue, but why?

Yesterday afternoon he was using his macbook (white, plastic, form 2006) and had finished all of his final exam papers which were due on Monday. He then shut his computer, went to get food, and when he came back to open it, it wasn't turning on.

At first he heard tons of clicking noises from inside the computer (sounded like the hard drive was skipping). A grey screen would come up and nothing would be displayed. Eventually the clicking stopped and now he just receives this gray screen (no boxes, no words, no recognition of anything). The only weird thing is that he still hears the signature mac ""boot-up"" sound when he presses the power button to turn his computer on.

He took it to Apple yesterday and they said that the hard drive was shot and that he needed to take it to a data recovery place. He tried the guys at best-buy who took his computer over night but told him this morning that they couldn't do anything and that he'd need to pay a couple thousand dollars for data recovery. Needless to say he doesn't have the time or money for this.

I know that its a huge shot in the dark but I was wondering if there was anything you guys could think of that we could try. I have access to basica peripherals like external hard drives, most wires I could need, etc. I'm pretty good with computers so I figured if you guys had any thoughts on how to access the files from this harddrive, I might be able to try and help him out.

There were performances issues with the oracle db but no one has experiences with oracle including me. I posted awhile ago about defragging oracle db, the physical disk has run out of space so I decide to add another raid 1+0 disk into it and copy the data files over. 


Setup

* logical 1 partition 1 -OS

* logical 1 partition 2 - oracle

* logical 2 - oracle database.


I added logical 3 drive so I can migrate logical 1 partiton 2 over. I stopped all the oracle services. Then I proceed to do a robocopy and mistyped the drive letter so it wiped out the oracle database. Although I press ctrl C but it still overwritten the file structure and I'm left with an empty drive.

I'm shitting myself because whoever set it up in the first place has put the backup on the same fucking physical drive which I overwritten. In addition no one knew about this server so it isn't backed up on tapes.

The data is extremely sensitive and  is monitored by the government as it is a biorepository. It contains about 2 years worth of research records. If the data is lost, not only I will lose my job but also my boss.

I get no response from pinging web addresses nor IPs, cannot connect to Steam or Evernote, but I can still upload/download torrents.

The WiFi on my laptop still works and pings fine and my laptop also works when only connected by ethernet cable, so I assume it can't be either the box or the cable.

I've also turned off my firewall and antivirus programs.

I've lastly tried using Google's public DNS and I have managed to browse the internet but only via Chrome, not Firefox, which now takes a good few minutes to start which was never a problem before. 

Then after reverting back to automatically obtaining a DNS server, I have stayed connected, but still unable to ping anything, including my own IP.

I have also tried the following commands and restarted after being recommended to do so by someone in /r/techsupport:

* netsh i i r r
* netsh winsock reset

Neither of which had any effect on the situation.

Has anyone got any solutions?

It ran perfectly for a couple days, but recently it's been disconnecting/having a limited connection to the internet. My other laptop and my kindle have no issues maintaining a connection.


What usually happens is that the connection bars in the corner will get a yellow triangle with an exclamation point. If I open up the box that shows the wireless connections, it says 'limited'. No webpages or programs requiring an internet connection work. When the internet is connecting normally, the signal is very strong and fast.


The only thing that seems to help is restarting the router(which is downstairs, so I can't just plug an ethernet cable into the laptop). I haven't noticed a pattern of when it disconnects; once it disconnected when the computer went to sleep, another time it disconnected when I was actively using it, and other times I'm briefly away from the laptop when it happens. The laptop has windows 8.


Note, I've already disabled the option that turns off the wireless card when the laptop goes into power saving mode.


I'd really appreciate any help and suggestions, thank you.
edit: Same issue just happened with my other laptop and the kindle, but only for about a minute, and it fixed itself after that. Not sure if it's related but I figured I'd add it on in case.

I have a Windows 8 laptop. I just tried installing my office's VPN application on it, which screwed something up and now it won't boot. It freezes at the splash screen.

I'd like to boot into Safe Mode so that I can uninstall the VPN program. But from what I'm reading on the web, you can only access Safe Mode in Windows 8 if you can boot normally. The old F8 key at boot doesn't work anymore.

Some people have said try Shift-F8, I have tried this twice and it didn't work either.

I have no clue what causes everything to trigger as a virus in all 3 browsers so i'm just listing everything i've got.

I just re-downloaded AVG as a torrent again through Vuze. I don't think Vuze is the screwup.

Since then I am unable to get the computer to power on.  I replaced the original hard drive connections first and tried it, nothing. I tried with no storage drives connected.

* check ram seating/take out ram in case it got jostled   
* plug in a different power supply to the motherboard

Update 1: Plugged power into ssd and hds, and it appears to have booted up and there are no codes on the mother board.

Update 2: Plugged in dvd drive and it is giving me ""no output device"" error which I assume has to do with there being no working video output.

Update 3: Getting a video card from friend. Will update later this morning

Update 4: Put in another video card, system boots.  It appears it is indeed a fried video card.

I'll keep this description as short as possible.

The issue: my HDTV will not show cable in HD. The picture is not widescreen, but square (letterbox on left and right). Changing the television's settings will make it widescreen, but it only looks stretched. What stumps me is that I also have a Xbox360 and Bluray player connected to this same HDTV, and those show up in perfect HD, it is only the connection from the cable box that isn't displaying correctly.

Things I have checked and troubleshooted with different parts: HDMI cable, HDMI port, HD cable box, wall jack

I have another HDTV (I'll call it 'B') in my house that works, so I tried plugging B into the setup for A. It works! Surprisingly, plugging A into B's setup does not. What I don't understand is what is going wrong. The cable boxes all work, the TV's work, but something is going on between HDTV A and any cable box. Does not make sense. I really appreciate any and all insight into this frustrating issue!

I didn't set a particular budget because I was mainly relying on second-hand components. After wrestling with dead motherboards and underpowered PSUs, I ended up getting all new, albeit budget, parts from NewEgg, save for a case and a couple of hard drives that I know are in working condition. Here's what I put together:

* [Biostar P43D3 motherboard (LGA 775 socket)](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813138185)
* [Pentium Dual-Core E6700 @ 3.20 GHz](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116370)
* [2x2GB Patriot DDR3-1333 memory](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820220537)
* [ATI Radeon HD 5770 graphics card](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150447)
* [Sentey ERP500-SS 500w power supply](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817322002)

I made sure to do my research and found that all these components should be compatible. The motherboard only supports DDR3-1066 memory without any overclocking, but that shouldn't be an issue according to what I found. Any higher speed memory will simply run at the maximum speed the mobo is capable of. And the mobo specs explicitly say that the CPU (which has a FSB of 1066 MHz) is compatible.

However, upon plugging everything in and powering up, nada. The computer appears to be powering on (fans are running, hard drive spins up, lights are on), but the display shows nothing and there are no POST beeps. I know the case speaker works (it's been used before) and during my troubleshooting routine, I powered the computer on without any memory inserted and it beeped like mad. So the mobo should be okay, right? I also cycled the memory sticks individually in the two memory slots and that didn't help, either.

I'm pulling my hair out here. Why would all-new parts that should be compatible fail to play nice with each other? Could the CPU be dead? Or is the power supply the wrong type? I'm not too proud to admit I could have overlooked something, but I have no idea what it could be. Thanks in advance.

**UPDATE:** See [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/hz2y1/just_built_a_computer_but_no_display_beeps_or/c1zpojm?context=1). Furthermore, I was able to test the graphics card in yet another computer (with a 400W power supply) and it worked fine. So, to quote my linked comment, all the components work, yet they don't work together.

**UPDATE 2:** OMFG it was an out of date BIOS. After using the alternate CPU to boot Windows, I flashed the latest BIOS file and BAM, everything is working. All this grief and it was a (relatively) simple fix. Ugh.

Overview
---
I have ~20 T-430 2342-6FU/6QU company laptops that are currently connected to our domain. We would like to use the [Lenovo Port Replicator](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/itemdetails/0A33942/460/EB6CE8241B8A47E18EBAF06F8726DA3E) as an easy access for our wandering staff members as they go out-of-office on work related adventures and need to lug around the laptop. 


Issue
---

After installing the drivers for this replicator, IE10 crashes instantly when launching the program. I tried to get an AppCrash rundown, but it only allows me to 'Close Program'. Below is the error:

*Error: Internet Explorer has stopped working 'A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.'*

Resolution (Yes, I found one. No, I don't like it.)
---
After sifting through countless articles, I found that there is a fix. When going into Control Panel &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced Tab &gt; Checkmark 'Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering*', and restarting the machine; this fixes the problem!


Side Notes
---
Now don't get me wrong, I would love to call it good; but this setting doesn't carry over to brand-new local profiles. This means each individual user that logs in to their domain user for the first time will get a crashing IE10 until doing this fix. I refuse to do this as I have too many other things to do at this job. This would simply run me up a wall. I am sure you all can empathize. Also, we cannot use another browser since our Citrix login webpage doesn't play well with others. 

I called Lenovo about 5 times with 5 different answers which is typical. I have been told that the unit is not fully compatible with the laptop (it is, I checked the reqs), that I needed to upgrade to the 3.0 (because I'm sure improved data transfer rate will solve this one), that the device itself is defective, and finally but not to be forgotten: we don't support the port replicator drivers (not like it's a Lenovo product or anything...).

Please help, I really need to finish this imaging project for my team. They have been waiting for their laptops and I feel like a douche for not getting this completed. I'm out of ideas. 

Thanks!

Is there any advice also? The computer came pre-build with custom parts thanks to NCIX, so I don't know much about assembling/disassembling nor the precautions needed to make sure nothing gets banged up.

Lastly, if I bring a powerbar and I use a power socket adapter, do I still need to change the sockets/use adapters for each plug my PC will be using or will one be enough?

Dell Studio Laptop running Windows 7.
Very frequently when I power the laptop on, the screen shuts off. Sometimes I can still see the graphics but with no light, impossible to navigate.
I began by just constantly holding the power button and toggling on and off until it stayed on. Sometimes it took 40 minutes to get my computer on and the problem seemed to get progressively worse.

I did a system restore, and it seemed to help for a few days.
This morning, the problem recurred. I had read on google about hitting Fn + F8. this worked. when my screen was dark, this made the power come on, but only for 5 seconds, then dark again.

What is the problem? What are my options?
Since the Fn/F8 combo works, it clearly appears to be software/Driver related. I have had warning boxes for a year about driver manager not working, but have never really had a related issue.

I’m hoping to find people who participate in these forums (including, though not limited to, this subreddit) who are willing to do a phone interview with me. I’m particularly interested in why people got started in these forums, why they participate, and how they view the community. I’m looking for diverse perspectives, so even if you’re not a frequent participant, I could still learn a ton from talking to you. The interviews should take between 30-60 minutes, and I’m totally flexible as to time. 

If you’d like to help me out with my research, either shoot me an email at Jordan.frith (at) unt.edu, pm me, or comment on this thread and I’ll message you. I really appreciate it!

* Crucial 128gb m4 SSD
* Seagate Barracuta 500gb HDD
* Corsair HX750 PSU

I built this computer about a year ago and have had this problem ever since.  Haven't been able to narrow down the problem and I'd like to before I throw any more money at it than i already have.

The computer crashes only when playing games.  It will crash to a black screen(I've never seen a blue screen on this PC) and I have to hard reset it.  Sometimes this happens after 10 minutes, sometimes 2+ hours. CPU and GPU temperatures look fine, in fact I've run GPU stress tests and mined bitcoins for 24+ hours without issue.  

I've tried swapping out the following components:  

* replaced the GPU with an old nvidia 9800 I had that never gave me problems.

* replaced motherboard (originally asrock z68 extreme3gen3)

* replaced PSU (originally corsair 650w)

* replaced ram (originally kingston DDR3-1600 8{4x2})

* replaced CPU and CPU cooler(currently using stock cooler that came with new CPU)

* I originally had windows 7 installed and upgraded to windows 8.  Recently did a clean install of windows 7.

I've imaged my windows installed hard drive and put it on both my SSD and HDD, unplugging the other to see if either of those was causing the crash and both continued to cause problems.  Event logs have been unhelpful because the only thing that shows up post crash is *""The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.""*  

I've used multiple surge protectors and even moved recently so I don't think this would be caused by any issues with power.  I'm out of ideas, unfortunately, and I've basically bought 2 PCs at this point.

**UPDATE**

&gt;So I pulled out the motherboard last night and found one spacer screw in the motherboard tray where &gt;there wasn't a hole.  It was basically right under the GPU(there was no visible damage to the underside &gt;of the mb).  I took it out and put everything back together and crashed again after a few hours.

&gt;When I restarted from that crash I couldn't boot from my SSD.  I took out the SSD(note, previously when I &gt;imaged my SSD to boot off the HDD I did remove the SSD).  Luckily I still had a boot partition set on my &gt;HDD with windows installed, so I didn't have to go through that process again.  I'll test some more &gt;tonight.  If I crash again I'll go through a clean install with only the HDD installed.

About a month ago I installed a new motherboard, CPU, and RAM. System has run flawlessly since then. 

Yesterday morning I woke up to a BSOD. After digging around a bit it looks like what's happening is that the SSD vanishes about 4-5 minutes after the system boots up. It runs fine until that point, and then suddenly the system will lock up and/or BSOD. 

On a warm reset if I go into the BIOS, the drive isn't there. It only shows up after a power off/power on. 

Same exact thing happens in safe mode. 

Switched the drive to a different SATA controller (from Marvell GSATA to Intel SATA - MB has both). Same exact symptoms. Updated all drivers - same symptoms. The drive has the latest firmware. 

Reading around online, I'm not the only person who this has happened to. From what I can tell, in general Corsair drives are the culprit, and I haven't found anyone who's recovered from this. 

I've got a new Samsung SSD on order, but thought I'd check here in the event anyone might have any other suggestions to save me doing a full reinstall of Windows.

1367494499.0,4,self.24hoursupport,1djmt6,"I DESPERATELY NEED HELP - Reformatting and installing Windows 7 sounds easy, right? NOPE. (x-post from /r/techsupport)",The_Griz,9,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/1djmt6/i_desperately_need_help_reformatting_and/,"Alright, I borrowed a friends Alienware Mx11 R2 laptop, promising I would reformat and install a fresh copy of Windows 7 due to a keyboard issue that randomly started happening in an effort to fix said issue. I suppose the issue is entirely relevant to my current issues so I will begin with the problematic behaviors that started this whole escapade.

**Keyboard Issues** - While playing League Of Legends one night on friends laptop, random keys stopped working mid-game. We had played a couple games previous to this one with absolutely no problems, and no problems ever having occurred like this before. It started with me noticing spacebar was no longer working. Then while pressing 3 to use a health potion, it responded by using flash which was bound to the letter d. We ended the game to remake it and in my client, the letter f started endlessly repeating its self without being pressed. Pressed a bunch of letters and it stopped repeating. Re-opened LoL client and when going to type in my password, each letter I typed was typing about 4 or 5 characters at a time into the field. Finally decided to restart, and upon doing so the entire keyboard locked up, extremely loud monotone constant beep blared (I assume from key being stuck, not physically)

I took the computer home with me to attempt to fix whatever this problem was. After endless hours of googling and not really finding any results, I tried everything I could think of to fix the keyboard. I don't remember what I did but somehow I got the computer to stop being locked up and to actually boot (it wouldn't load up before) however the entire keyboard was not working. Some of the things I did after this were:

* system restore to a previous known working date
* reinstall keyboard drivers
* type every shortcut that alienware includes on their keyboard
* attempt to open the computer to check the ribbon cable on the keyboard (still haven't done, no screwdriver small enough)
* went into the registry to check whether numlock was on. I recall it being a 2 I believe? It was whichever number option that means numlock is active. I tried to manually change the value back to 0 or 1, whichever turns off numlock. (this didn't change the value once I saved, and probably is the reason i'm having registry problems now as I try to reformat)

I might have done some other things, I don't remember but the important part was throughout this entire process, I went from having absolutely no keyboard functionality to having a seemingly random assortment of keys to not work, to having keys like g and h both typing the letter y instead, to then finally after all efforts being exhausted, having no function in the following keys: **G, H, Esc, Left Alt, Up Arrow, ' key, and I think that was all I could find, could have been more.** 

This issue was never resolved, although the laptop was at least functional while using the on-screen keyboard.

This brings me to the current and mind numbingly frustrating problem at hand. **The Windows 7 installation.**

First of all, the version of Windows I am trying to install is a lite version, because the Alienware Mx11 R2 laptop has no DVD drive, so you have to make a bootable USB drive for a clean install of Windows 7. Originally I was told to try and just do an Upgrade Install, where I wouldn't actually have to format or wipe any of the partitions, or even reboot windows, just simply run the install from the USB or ISO or whatnot while the computer is logged in and running then delete the old Windows file. This method proved to be futile for me as I encountered several errors while trying to install like missing Autorun.dll, ect. (I don't recall all of the issues)

So I decided that the only option was to do a full clean install and delete/format the old partitions and use a bootable USB.

**Well.**

I tried doing this several ways, with multiple copies of Windows 7 lite.
In an effort to make this post not insanely long, I will go ahead and try and explain the errors and process in the shortest way I can.

* Manually formatted the USB drive, mounted the Windows 7 ISO and drag and dropped the files directly from ISO to USB. I did not remember to include the bootsect command prompt line. It booted perfectly fine, loaded the installation wizard, I proceeded to select the main partition when prompted and formatted/deleted it and selected it for Windows install (I am a scrub and didn't realize I didn't have to delete the partition, I could have just deleted the old Windows file like planned) 1% into the installation it errors and says that winboot.dll or something like that is corrupt, unable to load ect.
* Second time around I did the same thing only I extracted the files from the ISO onto my computer first, and then transferred them to the USB. THIS time I would hit f12, select the USB to boot, the pre-Windows loading bar would flash for a second, then at the black screen where it says files are loading, it would error out and say something about being unable to boot. I don't remember the specific error
* Third time, I repeated the steps in attempt #1 only remembering I needed to include the bootsect line in command prompt. This time I believe it loaded in all the way up to the end of the black screen with a bar that says loading files, and then once the bar completed it said it was unable to locate Autorun.dll or it was corrupt.
* Fourth time I repeated attempt #2 with bootsect once again and got YET ANOTHER SEPARATE ERROR about WinSetup.dll being missing or corrupt
* The fifth time I downloaded an alternate copy of Windows 7 Lite, set up bootable USB with bootsect and copied the files without extracting, I believe I got a blue screen error of some sort this time.
* Sixth time I repeated attempt #5 but extracting Windows, it booted, got into the black loading files screen, loaded all the way to the end and then froze indefinitely. I let it sit for over an hour just to see if it would do anything and it did not.
* The Seventh and final time I downloaded the Windows USB DVD download tool to automatically format and create the bootable USB instead of manually in case it was user error.
At this point, it booted, got to the black loading files screen, loads 100% and then blue screens displaying this error (which I believe is a registry error, even though **I don't have an OS or partition other than the 100mb recovery partition anymore**)

Forgot to mention that I tried setting up the USB on my computer and booting it on my friends laptop in every different combination of USB drives possible because I was unaware which were 2.0 and which were 3.0. Not sure it it's relevant at all

I opened up the task manager and to my surprise, Explorer.exe actually was using about 6.8 GB of RAM (the remaining 1.2 GB was used by ordinary background stuff like Firefox and other system processes, as it always is)...

I let Windows restart the Explorer.exe process, and my RAM cleared back down to ~2 GB as normal, so I figured it was just some kinda one-off problem. I resumed watching a video and about 30 to 40 minutes later, Windows popped up the same error message, saying that my system was low on memory, with Explorer.exe being the culprit.

So this time I manually killed Explorer.exe via the task manager (so that it wouldn't restart automatically), and noticed that simply killing the process wasn't releasing the memory. It would only release if Windows restarted the process itself, via the out-of-memory popup. Now I think that might be normal, so anyway...

I restarted the laptop to see if that would help. Unfortunately, it didn't... As soon as Windows starts (well, about 20 or 30 seconds after the desktop begins loading), **the Explorer.exe process begins leaking or ""eating"" memory, all the way up to my full 8 GB** of RAM. It also **uses a steady 13 percent of the CPU**, which is another indication it's doing something strange (that's high for even idling on my laptop).

In looking at the task manager, I can see that Explorer.exe seems to ""eat"" about 4 to 5 MB of RAM per second, and that figure is pretty exact... I can see the ""Commit"" memory rising at the steady pace every time Explorer.exe starts, coupled with it always using that solid 13 percent of the CPU as well...

Now I haven't installed any new software (anything that would show up in Add/Remove Programs, that is) within a few days of when this started, and I ran a couple different AV; Microsoft Security Essentials, and then Malwarebytes... Neither of them found anything. I ran [GMER](http://www.gmer.net/) for a quick rootkit check, but it doesn't seem to find anything either. However, when I was using MSSE, I did notice that back on April 6, it looked like a Worm was quarantined, which I didn't notice at the time. I removed it totally from MSSE, though... I'm not sure if this could be related, because the AV progs aren't finding anything now, but here's a screenshot just in case:

http://i.imgur.com/1op0Lx8.jpg

Okay, the last thing I can note that might be helpful is some results I got when running VMap, to try and see if there is some rogue DLL that's affecting Explorer.exe... I don't know how to use this app that well, but I was able to ""trace the stack"" or whatever, and it seems like the problem might some how be related to the **ntdll.dll** library. First of all, I remember getting this error message once when I first noticed the problem, when Windows first gave me the initial out-of-memory popup, I think:

http://i.imgur.com/6gmGjWj.jpg

Next, when I was running Vmap, I noticed the **RtlAllocateHeap** seemed to corrospond with each ""tick"" of memory that was being eaten:

http://i.imgur.com/lJt95WA.jpg

RtlAllocateHeap seemed to endlessly be doing this, gradually up to 99 times then starting back over, as you can see in this screenshot...

http://i.imgur.com/CBEYrnJ.jpg

...and it would have kept going (I presume) until it ate up the full 8 GB, if I would have kept letting it run for 30 or 40 minutes. Here's one more screenshot:

http://i.imgur.com/RtEC1uu.jpg

Right now, the only way I can effectively use my laptop here is to keep Explorer.exe killed, which I'm sure you can imagine is a pain. I've tried some of the usual, common-sense troubleshooting and I noticed that Windows deployed a bunch of security updates within the last couple weeks, so I made sure to install those (also ran the latest April version of the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool).

I'm normally pretty good at diagnosing stuff like this, but I can't find any ""rogue"" processes or anything like that, and the Google results for ""Explorer.exe memory leak"" don't seem to pertain to this problem I'm having (specifically the fact that the process will keep eating memory until all 8 GB are gone, and eating it at steady pace of about 5 MB per second).

It seems like it might be some really strong, low-level rootkit or worm, based on that behavior, doesn't it? Anyway, if someone could help me diagnose this, I'd really appreciate it. I don't have enough free external hard drive space to (easily) reformat my system, unless I absolutely have to...

Thanks...

**UPDATE:** I've been able to stop the problem from happening while Explorer.exe is open by disabling ALL non-Microsoft shell extentions. Right now I'm giving the PC some time and use to make sure the problem is gone, and I'm also trying to figure out which shell extention could be causing this by re-enabling them, one at a time...

See this guy's post, and my reply, for more info:

I'll mark this thread as solved pretty soon here, once I'm sure the problem is really gone... Thanks all.

**EDIT:** Resolved. Problem hasn't come back, although I still haven't isolated which shell extension is causing the leak. If I'm able to figure it out, I'll post back here with an update, for posterity to help other users.

The PC has 2 hard drives (1 ssd, 1hdd) and my intention is to use the SSD (C:) as the boot drive for the OS as well as some frequently used programs and the secondary HDD (E:) as storage for documents, pics, and infrequently used programs. 

Since I want to save all my documents on the secondary drive, I decided to change the location of the ""My Documents"" folder that was originally on the C: drive. Being stupid, I set the location of this folder as the entire E: drive. For example, now when I click on ""My Documents"" in the side panel, it's as if I'm opening up the entire drive. Also, when I open up the E: drive from My Computer, the My Documents folder does not show up. Since the folder does not show up, I cannot change the location of it.

**Is there anyway I can reverse what I've done?**

The only solution I've found so far is to change the Registry values of the Personal folder in

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders

but I don't want to mess it up even more.

Would anyone be able to provide the exact Value Data I would have to input?

My HD is less than %40 full, and I've defragged everything. I also ran the webroot system cleaner as suggested in the other thread.

So I had my laptop which worked pretty good, dual booting Windows 8 and openSUSE. I choose which one by the own UEFI boot loader, which shows ""openSUSE"" and ""Windows Boot Loader"" entries.

But I am kinda curious and decided to try Linux Mint. As my openSUSE was freshly installed, I decided to overwrite it. If anything went wrong with MInt, I'd restart with openSUSE anyway.

Everything went fine. But even replacing the openSUSE partition, it still showed on UEFI boot manager, along with Windows and linuxmint. 

So I removed both SUSE directory from /boot/EFI and the openSUSE entry on boot loader, using efibootmgr -b 000C -B (000C was the openSUSE entry). Then efibootmgr showed everything fine, only the correct entries (i.e.: the previous ones, but openSUSE)

But as I never did it before, I think it should have any ""commit"" command on efibootmgr, because now my UEFI boot manager doesn't show anything. Not even Windows. But the weird fact is... It boots to Windows.

Is there any way to fix the UEFI boot loader instead of reinstalling the whole thing from scratch?

Having an issue where my main monitor connected by HDMI will flicker. Sometimes it'll flicker quickly, other times it'll turn black and stay that way until I unplug and replug it - only for it to begin flickering again.  

When I unplug my second monitor the flickering stopped for awhile, though it would still sort of flicker occasionally. When I unplugged the HDMI from my main monitor and connected it via DVI the flickering stopped. Unfortunately my GPU doesn't have 2 DVI ports and I don't have a DVI-HDMI convertor cable (nor do I know if that'd even work). So I'm here asking for ideas.

I completely uninstalled my ATI drivers, went through the registry and deleted all traces of AMD/ATI components and then reinstalled the latest ATI driver for my card. The driver &amp; related software I installed is

* Display Driver ver. 9.012
* OpenCL(tm) Driver ver. 10.0.1084.4
* Catalyst Control Center ver. 2012.1219.1520.27485

The tech specs of the PC are:

*3.40 gigahertz Intel Core i7-3770
*16 Gigs of DDR3 1600Mhz Ram
*AMD Radeon HD 7700 Series

I don't think the power of the hardware is the issue of course so I'm trying to figure out what else it could be. Perhaps some setting with the Catalyst software I'm not seeing? 

The main monitor I'm using is an Asus 27 inch at 1920x1080.  I wasn't having this issue on my older, much slower work PC that this new one replaced.  My new PC is an XPS 8500

TL,DR version:

- Main 27 inch monitor flickers when connected by HDMI, particularly when second monitor is set up.
- Wiped all old ati/amd driver and software, clean installation of latest drivers for 7700HD
- Looking for help desperately :(

I received an email at about 1am EST from xxxblackbook .com an email saying that at 12:57 am I had signed up for an account. Normally I wouldn't think anything of it, but when I looked at the email what I saw freaked me out.

The account name was ""secondary"" account name I use. It's one that I tend to use and deal with on forums where my other user names are not ""fitting"" for which whatever reason. The difference though was that they added 2 additional digits at the end.

The password was more unnerving. It was one of my previously most commonly used passwords. It's now been phased out mostly but it's still used on a spare few accounts. (Mostly accounts which I can't remember or don't actively use).

To top it off, the IP address it came from is from the city I used to live in (lived there during college, so for 4 years) but have been away from for about 2 or so years now.

I haven't lost any devices nor have any devices been stolen (old devices remain inactive and sitting off). I'm on a Mac and I've scanned it for viruses and malware which it came back clean. The email address it was sent to has a different password currently (though it used to be the same) than the account that was ""registered"" is using.

The only service that my email is tied to which has recently been ""compromised"" or had issues is Tumblr, which does not nor would not know for any reason my ""secondary"" account name.

What can I do, other than change my passwords as I remember them?

Is there anything I should be worried about? Why would it be registering from a city I used to live in? Perhaps I signed up for something that is being printed and mailed to my previous address?

I've tried Hiren's Boot CD, but I couldn't figure it out.

I've looked into HDD Unlock Wizard and Repair Station, but HDD Wiz defeats my purpose in erasing all the data and Repair Station requires all the ATA ports be boot in Legacy mode.

All I want to do is unlock my drive. Any help would be *GREATLY* appreciated.

[edit] Thank you all for the feedback. I'll probably have this figured out in a while, but I'm leaving it for now because I have some more important work to do.

[fixed] Thank you all for the help. In the end I gutted the old laptop for its motherboard and MacGyvered it into working for me. One quick romp in the BIOS and the drive was unlocked. Thanks again for all your help!

I found about 80% of my info on past backups... still missing some important business files but I may just have to live without them.  I still have the drive and it is still bricked as far as access goes.  I even did a drive copy to the 1T drive so I can give it a go hacking at it...  Thanks to everyone, I really appreciate it!

3. I attempted to change my firewall settings, but had no admin access
4. Attempted to reactivate admin settings, but was unable to

8. Attempted to change the settings under the new temporary profile (which has had no issues going online or with the firewall)

What do?

Here's the long version: Last week a couple of capacitors blew on my graphics card so I got a new one(a 7850.) When I put in my new card my mobo stopped posting, I could and still can get power to everything but the bios and whatever controls the post(the bios as well I assume.) All the fans rev up, my hdds spin and after some time my cpu's heatsink gets warm to the touch. So I assume everything is getting power but I don't have a multimeter to test it but just to be sure I tried another working PSU with a barebones pc set up(no gfx card, 1 stick of ram, etc) with no luck. Then upon further examination of my mobo I noticed a small black box with 3 connectors above my bios chip and next to a pci-e slot was not connected to the board anymore(the left most connection was broken.) So like the electrical engineer I am not I tried to solder it back on, again with no luck. So I assume either 
1) I have a bad psu which caused both my mobo and my gfx card to fail. 
2) I stupidly broke my mobo when taking my old gfx card out.
or 3) I have no idea

So /r/24hoursupport I need other people's opinion on this. Is it my psu or my mobo? Socket 1366 boards are pretty expensive so should I just sell my i7 920(for how much idk) and get a cheap amd cpu/mobo combo? I'd really rather do this on the cheap because like I said I already bought a brand new gfx card and I'd rather no spend a lot more money. Specifically I am looking at something like this http://compare.ebay.com/like/200698735855?var=lv&amp;ltyp=AllFixedPriceItemTypes&amp;var=sbar for a replacement mobo.

About a month ago, I went on vacation. I'm a photographer so I took a TON of pictures. One folder has about 41.9 GB of pictures. This folder has a subfolder with probably about 9GB of pics. I intended to stitch all the photos in that 9GB folder into one, enormous photo (billboard sized). However, it proved to be more than my computer could handle and my laptop would freeze whenever I tried to stitch that many pictures. I force restarted, abandoned my grand project, and thought nothing of it.

Then, a few days later, weird stuff started happening. Whenever I turned on my computer, physical memory would go crazy and go up to 99% immediately. Nothing could be done outside of safe mode. The culprit was Microsoft windows search protocol host, which was using all my physical memory. To fix it, I had to disable search indexing on my C drive. Since then, things have been normal.

However, in that month since, that same 9GB folder is inaccessible. Trying to open it results in explorer.exe using up 80-90% of my physical memory. I have no choice but to force restart. 

I'd really like to see those photos! What do?

Here's the situation.

Yeah i know... but i recently heard about teksavvy that offers a base one of 6mbps now those of you fermilar with both who would you pick? Or would they both be about the same? Both are DSL by the way
Now for eastlink APPARENTLY i don't for what ever reason other then god hates me my house doesn't have a cable like running to it. and they said they can't run a temp one because they hate me (some bs about it having to run over others property even thou the cable box is right behind my house) and they have to wait until summer to bury a cable.

Time Warner Cable up'd the ante by throwing in a new charge for a modem lease (which makes no sense considering *I haven't changed my modem*) but whatever, it's still cheaper than buying my own modem for almost 3 years. Other ISPs have that lease fee so I guess they wanted to milk that, too. The bigger problem is that they're telling me that next June my fee will continue to rise.

Once high speed internet became available in my area, I switched to Verizon DSL (and hated it). The line was just way too slow when multiple people were online. About a year and a half ago I switched to TWC. The service was FAR superior and the price relative to the service was much more fair than Verizon's DSL. So, uh, now what?

The infrastructure in my area is pretty horrible, too, so no matter which ISP I go with I'm bound to face occasional connectivity issues.

So, I beseech those of you who know more on this subject than I, please help me figure out what to do about my internet service.

* Which connection speed is fast/reliable enough for a gamer with other residents that watch movies/shows online. 5 mb/s? 10 mb/s? I can downgrade my current plan and try to save there.

If I were to throw the laptop's hard drive into an enclosure and hook it up to one of my other computers (or better, the new laptop when it arrives), is there any way I can retrieve my emails from the old hard drive?

I'm just wondering if anyone's ever heard of this before. As of yesterday, I noticed my HP Envy 15 laptop shuts off when I unplug it from the wall even though the battery is recognized and has a 94% charge.

Right now if I hover over the battery icon in windows 7 it says ""94% available (plugged in, not charging)."" I know it's recognizing the battery in some way because yesterday it was at 96% charged. 

If I shut down the laptop and unplug the AC it will not turn on at all if I push the power button.

I've inspected the battery and the leads it connects to on the laptop and nothing appears to be wrong/burnt... at least not on a visual inspection.

I rarely use the laptop not plugged in so I'm not sure exactly when the problem started, but about 2 weeks ago I updated the bios firmware and I had it briefly unplugged then and it worked fine. I'm not sure if this would have anything to do with it but it's the last time I made any significant changes or updates. 

I'd go buy a new battery but I don't want to waste my money if that's not the problem. The fact that it has a 94% charge right now makes me think it may not be the issue. The laptop is out of warranty as well.


Any suggestions on what to do here?

So I have a logitech G35 headset and logitech g51 speakers connected to my computer. I recently formatted and, since then, every time I try to open the sound panel or audio devices, the volume application freezes then crashes unless something forces sound to be played, like a steam notification. At this point everything that was lagging instantly opens.

Also, I get no sound on youtube or media players etc until I get a chat notification or by pressing a key while on desktop.

I think it has something to do with my G35 software because it worked when I uninstalled it. I need the software for gaming though.
Thanks for your help.

I understand that I might have some sort of 'show hidden files' activated, but I haven't been able to figure it out. Usually in situations like this, from what I understand, these files would be ghosted at least.

I work at a small financial services firm who's agents act as a broker for people shopping for life insurance plans and annuities. Well, many of these agents have tons of files, over some more than 100+ that are an unorganized mess that are sitting in file cabinets unorganized and not easily accessible. I am looking for a solution that will digitize them, perhaps have these files scanned in so that a digital copy can be created of the file. In addition to this, I also need this database to be well organized, so that the agent can search the files based on certain criteria, for example, their monthly contribution, acceptance status etc. Also it is imperative that I have this database be secured, because of obvious security threats that can arise when dealing with social security numbers and sensitive financial data. Secondly, it would be a huge plus if this data could be accessible from the internet mainly because many of these agents work on the go and having access to these files through just the internet would be a great plus. If anyone has any recommendations I would be greatly appreciated, or if you can point me to an appropriate sub that would be great too. 

Btw, I have thought about using something like a carbonite service, but that doesn't fully solve my problem of being able to organize my data, closest I could think of is an excel spreadsheet. Thanks again!

I also erased everything and re-installed the OS (I was going to do that anyway for an unrelated problem) but this issue is still there.

I was using the DNS serves from google, but I deleted them, thinking they were the problem, but it's still coming up with this message. I took it to the Apple store as well and they were unable to figure out what it was.

Also, the time/date settings are correct on my computer. Apparently this has been an issue for other people, but that's not the case for me.

Edit: I think I fixed it, and it was almost certainly my fault. A while ago I was browsing through the settings on my router and I found [this page](http://i.imgur.com/iLRRz.png). Not knowing what I was doing, I selected HTTPS, since it's generally a good idea to use it, but in this case I'm pretty sure that was the problem. It only happened on my home network, and it happened to more than just my computer.  All I had to do was log into the router and change the settings back.  It's working fine so far, but I'll update this if anything changes.

I hope this helps in case any body else has the same problem!!

Would flashing the BIOS help perhaps?  Could it be a PSU issue perhaps?  it's a thermaltake 430W (pretty good PSU I think?).

My speed is awful with the cord aswell: http://www.speedtest.net/result/2182454124.png This my network manager: http://imgur.com/FduK7 and this was my old speedtest, before I upgraded, on wifi: http://imgur.com/Vmyns I don't really know much about networking so any and all help is welcome. Sorry for the wall of text!

Well holy shitballs, I did a speedtest of our desktop computer and I got almost exactly the same results as with my laptop. I think my ISP is trying to pull a fast one on us. Thanks for the help!

Final Edit: Spoke with ISP, got it all cleared up. Now rolling with a 25mb/s connection!

So I have a work computer and a home computer work with design. I want to work on projects at home during spare time without having to move files around back and forth with a USB drive or portable hard drive. I am wondering if there is a way to make it so that I can have two folders, one on each computer, that sync with each other through the internet so that when I make changes at work on a file, the file is updated with the latest changes in the same folder on my home computer. I know there are tools such as Windows Live Mesh, SyncToy, SugarSync, Dropbox, etc, but as far as I can tell, they either only sync locally on a network, local to online only, or have to store it on the could on their server. Also, I because I work with large files, a several gigabyte cap would not be ideal. I do not want to host all my files on the cloud because I need to able able to access files offline. So what I am looking for is having two versions of the same file on my work and on my home computer that, when connected online, sync together. When offline, I should still be able to work on files because they are stored on the computers and not the cloud, and then when internet is back up, it is able to sync. If there is any program, or any way to set that up, I would really appreciate it. Thanks! Please ask me again if I am not very clear in describing the setup.

Google searches are being redirected to spam websites, so I've had to resort to using... Bing.

My computer also won't start up by itself. When I power it on, I get a PXE-E61 error code and it tells me it failed to connect to the network boot, and I can't do anything else.

I went into the boot menu and made sure the order was correct (HDD first, then CD/DVD, then everything else with Network last), but that didn't change the problem.

The only way I can access Windows is if I hold 0 on the keyboard while powering up, forcing Toshiba to boot the HDD. From there I can load Windows and do everything normally (except the Google problem is still there).

I also tried to do a System Restore but still had the same results after. I've run MBAM, Spybot and Windows Security Essentials and they were unable to find any additional problems. I've also tried running a registry cleaner; that found a few issues but none of them seemed related to what I had.

I'm afraid to simply use my computer using the 0-button method because I might have a bigger problem, or the virus might still be running around. I don't really feel safe using it for anything now, but I'd rather fix it than re-format my computer (if reformatting would even work).

I have a Toshiba A305D Satellite running Windows Vista (32 bit).

**EDIT: Wasn't actually related to the HDD at all (as I suspected since the problem started at the same time as the virus). I ran TDSS and didn't find anything, then ran a rootkit fixer (which found the Trojan and removed it). Then I tried to run Windows Security Essentials, which wasn't able to update (probably the Trojan disabled it), so I couldn't update it but I could scan. The Trojan was also blocking manual updates to WSE, so I uninstalled/reunstalled WSE and then was able to update again - WSE located another Trojan similar, and removed it. All the while MBAM and Spybot were unable to do anything. I installed a trial of HitmanPro, which found another Trojan which revealed that my computer was accessing the net through a proxy (the cause of my Google redirect issue), and removed it. Did a shutdown and restart and the computer works fine now. Did more virus scans since then to check, but nothing comes up in any of the programs (HitmanPro, MBAM, Spybot, WSE).**

**2nd Edit**: Called the tech who installed my service. Resolved my problem. Wrong security protocol (WPA2, instead of WPA). Also my modem is a DOCSIS 2.0 instead of 3.0 Will replace the modem eventually, but it works for now. Big thanks to everyone, but Good Guy Comcast Tech came though for me.

So my desktop is an [HP DX2200](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06a/12454-12454-64287-321860-3328893-1844701.html?dnr=1) with a [P4 630 3.0Ghz](http://ark.intel.com/products/27478/Intel-Pentium-4-Processor-630-supporting-HT-Technology-(2M-Cache-3_00-GHz-800-MHz-FSB). 

I upgraded to 2GB DDR2 667Mhz RAM (the max the mobo supports) and a friend gave me a [Radeon HD 4350 1GB](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150390) that he had lying around so that I could get some better performance in games.

While that was alright for some games... my FPS in Starcraft 2 and the Diablo 3 beta was just too low. However, while performance wasn't too desirable, I was *not* having the graphics glitches shown in the pictures using this CPU, GPU and mobo.

I decided to make a small boost in my computers power, so I purchased an [Intel E5700](http://ark.intel.com/products/42801/Intel-Pentium-Processor-E5700-(2M-Cache-3_00-GHz-800-MHz-FSB) CPU and an [Intel DG41RQ](http://ark.intel.com/products/39683/Intel-Desktop-Board-DG41RQ) motherboard to replace what I had. For the most part, everything runs great. I get much better FPS in games like Starcraft 2, Portal and Minecraft. And a lot better performance with other CPU intensive tasks. However no matter how low or high I set the graphics settings I get those graphics issues.

At first I thought the issue was just in Starcraft 2, so I downloaded Steam and Portal to be sure... and unfortunately that wasn't the case. I didn't see any issues in Minecraft... but that game doesn't use complex textures.

I really don't know what could be causing these issues, and I'm skeptical that it could be the graphics card because it worked just fine previously with a different motherboard. Also note that I'm using Windows 7 64bit and all Windows updates available are applied. Also, I doubt that the current PSU (250w) isn't enough to power the new board and CPU since the new one actually uses a lot less power than the previous one.

So far to try to fix the problem I've:

* Uninstalled and reinstalled Catalyst Control Center (the ATI/AMD drivers package) multiple times and made sure it was the latest driver
* Used Driver Sweeper to remove all present ATI/AMD drivers while in safe mode... then reinstalled Catalyst Control Center
* Made sure DirectX is up to date
* Made sure all Windows 7 updates are applied
* Taken out the GPU and made sure the PCIe connector didn't have any crap on it, put it back in the computer
* Checked to make sure either the CPU or GPU wasn't overheating... when I max out both of them the GPU stays around mid 50C and the CPU stays around high 40C
* Ran FurMark to see if it fails... it seems to finish without issue

So what should I do next? Anyone got suggestions on what I should try now? Thanks for any suggestions!

Android 2.3.4
HTC Sense 2.1

I don't know if this is the place for it, so let me know if I need to go somewhere else.

It's so simple that it's ridiculous, but I can't figure it out. I've been to the droidforums, android forums, and I've read through many suggestions, but they don't apply to me.

Here's the gist of it. I changed my gmail password on my computer and my phone didn't sync. After googling it and following suggestions, I got to the screen that says ""Sign in error"" and prompts me for my password. I entered the new password and it didn't work so I tried the old password and it didn't work, so I restarted the phone and entered the old password first, and that didn't work, and so I figured I must have entered the new password incorrectly the first time and tried it and it didn't work.... you see where this is going. 2 days later the only solution I haven't tried is a factory reset. I really would rather not do that for obvious reasons. Is there anything I can do?

Edit: I also saw where going to the android market changes it, but I get the same screen and the same problem.

**Edit again: So naturally after I *finally* break down and ask someone... I went to page 2 or 3 of a comment section to find this (and I don't know why it was so damn difficult) but here it is:**

&gt;SOLUTION
&gt;I struggled with this. My google account sync and gmail did not work. If i entered my password for my gmail account, it would fail every time.

&gt;What you need to do is:

&gt;1. Go you google from your computer.
2. Go into your account settings (click on your name in the top left.)
3. Click on Authorizing applications &amp; sites(Edit) and you will need you google password.
4. At the bottom of this page should be your application code (this is NOT your google password.) if it does not exist like with me, there is a Generate button, give it a name (i just call mine Android) and go Generate password. You will get a pattern of random characters.
5. Go into gmail app and under settings go refresh, you will be prompted for your password.
Enter you app code you generated or from your app settings This is the password you enter into your gmail application password request.

&gt;Viola! Everything will work again

**Solution: Deleted partition on flash drive and recreated it.**

I have a Dell Studio 1555 Bios A13

I have three flash drives, one a 1gb HP flash drive, one a 2gb Sandisk Cruzer, and one a 16gb Patriot XT

When the HP 1gb drive and Sandisk 2gb are plugged in during boot, nothing happens. It POSTs fine and starts windows.

When the Patriot drive is plugged in during boot, the BIOS hangs 2/3rds of the way through POST and reboots after about 2 minutes, ad infinitum.

I have tried multiple formatting schemes. Also note that there is absolutely nothing on any of these drives, they are all completely empty and freshly formatted.

* 1gb drive formatted to FAT works, FAT32 works, exFAT works, all regardless of allocation size.

* 2gb drive formatted to FAT works, FAT32 works, exFAT works, all regardless of allocation size.

* 16gb drive formatted to FAT32 fails, exFAT fails, regardless of allocation size. I have tried a full (non-quick) format to check for bad sectors, to no avail. I have tried HP format tool rather than windows format tool, to no avail.

I already have 4 primary partitions, so I can't make another one to dual boot.

Disabling legacy USB support fixes it, but makes it useless as a boot drive since you can no longer boot off of it.

The problem does not seem to be exclusive to that computer.  The same drive will not boot on other computers either.

I even tried installing MS system sweeper on it to no avail, BIOS still hangs.

hey fellow redditors,

I work as an assistant editor at a small post house. We are an insanely small shop with no IT support whatsoever. My expertise is mainly in creative and I'm totally stumped by this. I hope you guys can pull through for me.

We recently discovered that one of our computers was transferring data at an extremely slow speed. It turns out that it was only connecting @ 100baseTX. All the other rooms in the office do not have this problem (automatically connecting @ 1000baseT). I connected my laptop (different computer) straight from the gigabit switch, and it was fine. I also plugged my laptop into the ports of each room and it was fine, except for the problem room.

I'm working with intel mac pros. These machines should autodetect straight v. crossover cables. I'm guessing that the problem arises somewhere between the switch and the port in the room?

Many thanks. If any of you guys help me figure this out and happen to be in NYC, beer is on me!!!

I've looked at these routers so far:

[**Netgear D6300**](http://www.netgear.com.au/home/products/wirelessrouters/ultimate-performance/D6300.aspx) - I know the AC will be redundant without a dongle plugged in, which I probably will not be buying. And that this is also a modem.

[**ASUS RTN66U - The Dark Knight**](http://www.asus.com/Networking/RTN66U/)

If anyone would be able to tell me which one would be best for a home environment that would be great. (Price doesn't really matter so don't take that into account)

Or if anyone has any other recommendations that would be really appreciated. Thanks for your help.

P.S. If anyone could match a modem to go with the routers that would be great. (:

So, I've been having a few issues with what I believe to be my motherboard. Just looking for a way to prove that it's the case before purchasing a new one. A few days back now, installed Shadowrun Returns through Steam, launched into the game - 90 minutes later the game crashed, Windows froze and PC restarted. Same thing happened again after the reboot. The time after that however, I got garbled text during POST and really odd behavior once I'm in Windows. 


What I see during boot:

* https://www.dropbox.com/s/2anoh96es6bu1ec/2013-07-26%2021.38.18.jpg

* CPUz Results: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hkfgdt71il2awvy/Workstation.html
* Minidump: https://www.dropbox.com/s/m09hzwzaq9i97pq/072613-20498-01.dmp

My Specs:

* Windows 8 Enterprise 64bit
* Gigabyte EX58-UD3R (1366/socket b)
* Intel i7 920 @ 2.67ghz
* Asus Nvidia 285 GTX and  Zotac 295 GTX
* 12gb G.Skill RipJaw DDR3 
* 2x OCZ Vertex4 SSD


What I've done:

* System restore (I'd run Windows Update and installed Shadowrun prior to this happening)
* Memtest, no issues
* Chkdsk blue-screened at 31% (have since changed drives and re-formatted/re-run chkdsk and it's been fine)
* Sfc /scannow reported no issues
* Pulled the working Zotac 295 GTX out of the machine next to me and swapped it across, same symptoms
* Booted to safe mode (Windows launches fine in safe mode)
* Removed and re-installed NVidia drivers (stable and beta release) on multiple occasions
* Tested both the cards in both PCIe slots on my motherboard, same symptoms
* Updated BIOS
* Cleared CMOS
* Changed kit across to new case with 750W Corsair PSU (upgrade from 550W it was running on)
* All temps seem fine
* Confirmed capacitor caps are fine
* Booted into Knoppix live disk and run ntfsfix with no issues
* Updated Firmware of OCZ Vertex4 drives
* Re-seated every possible device
* Used compressed air to clean everything


As it currently stands, I can boot through and get into windows (running on generic Microsoft Basic Display Driver - with the garbled text during boot still). While I initially thought it was going to be Video related, my gut feeling now is that my motherboard has issues - I can't easily get my hands on a Socket B motherboard these days though (in Australia at least, even 2nd hand ones are going for $200 odd AUD)


If anyone has any thoughts I'm all ears!

When I accessed Reddit from my iphone, connected via the same wifi network, everything was fine, and I didn't get any type of warning.  It happened after I followed a link in a Reddit comment thread.  I never even got to the site (boobfart.com), but was immediately redirected.  I had to click an acknowledgement on the Time Warner screen that I would look into the issue, and then I was able to access Reddit again.  

Should I be worried?  As far as I know, I don't have a virus or anything on my computer.

I only have 1 router, and only 1 modem. My modem is plugged in to the WAN port of my router, and the Ethernet cable leading to my computer (PC A) is in slot 1. There are no other Ethernet cables plugged into my router. There is only 1 Ethernet port in the back of PC A. When PC A is on, the WiFi works fine. When I turn off PC A, my laptop and my phone are unable to connect to the WiFi. On my laptop, the network map shows that it is able to connect to my router, and able to get my IPv4 address. It is saying that the connection from my router to the internet is not working when PC A is turned off.

1. My family's 50-100GB iTunes Library resides on our 1TB WD My Book World

2. All computers are running iTunes 11.0.4

3. The two computers that are using this library are a Windows 8 PC, with Offline Files enabled on the iTunes folder on the NAS, and a Hackintosh running 10.8.3

4. The Windows 8 PC reads the library just fine

5. The Hackintosh only reads 1 song from the library

6. The files are definitely on the NAS, I browsed the iTunes Media folder in the iTunes folder on the NAS.

How can I get my hackintosh reading the library properly?

And please do not go off at me for using a hackintosh, it was a personal decision, and should not be affecting this issue.

We also only have 1 person reading it at a time. It is rarely used on the hackintosh, just the windows 8 PC, but as the pc resides in the lounge room, its a pain to manage the library from there. We prefer to consume the content from that computer. Heck, if there is a way that means that it doesn't need iTunes at all, I'd be happy to hear it. We have an Apple TV too.

Everytime it isn't charging anymore I have to close every window and unplug/plug till it is working again.

My Laptop doesn't work when there is no battery in it. (I start laptop and after about 10 sec blackscreen.)

My theory is that my 120 watt power supply for my laptop (Acer Aspier 7750G) is not enough.  
(I've tried 2 other 120 watt power supplies and both of them are also not working.)

My current power supply give: 19V, 6,32A

I am planning on getting a 150 watt power supply (19V, 7,9A).

My question is:  
Should I try it? Can a 150 watt power supply damage my laptop?  
I heard that my current power supply (19V, 6,32A) always give 19V but the current intensity depends on how much my laptop needs (6,32A is the maximum it can give; so I am planning to push up the maximum incase 6,32A is not enough). Is that true?

I don't have warranty anymore (I gave my laptop to a local workshop, they opened it up, warranty vanished...) so I can't send it in.

Haven't tested with 150 Watt yet. Asking before doing it. Will have my power supply on monday (lending from friend).

I had to use the cached version because it redirects you to another promotional page.

I've had the laptop since Christmas time. It worked all up until about March. I was able to play all of the games listed below at or around a constant 60 fps. 

So the games I play mainly consist of Minecraft, Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3, Runescape, and League of Legends.

I don't know what happened in March (Not very tech-savvy) but since then, the only games I can play are League of Legends at 20-30 fps, Minecraft at 20-30 fps, and Runescape at 5-15 fps. All 'high-end' games are out of the question. It feels like a slideshow.

I tried looking online to fix it, and spent around 2 days straight talking with tech support. I've tried too many things to count. I reinstalled the drivers, and a bunch of other shit I can't remember in my rage. (One of the tech support live chats lasted around 2.5 hours before I gave up.)

-performed a memory cycling test where I took out all of the memory sticks and loaded one, and turned on until computer crashed. Repeated this step for all the sticks individually.


-Ran Ultimate Boot CD (Has not crashed on me yet when inside this boot-up utility). Examined all the parts, and did a SMART HDD test, everything returned Healthy for hard-drive test.


-Ran a utility from the UBCD, and did a complete wipe from a variant of Dariks boot and nuke (performed a DoD-short wipe with 3 rounds and 1 verify) --&gt; did not shut down during this wiping which took 20 hours.


-After wiping ran a virus test from an AVG recovery CD and it did not find anything.


-After Virus scan tried to re-install windows --&gt; Shut-down during install. (interestingly, the monitor went blank the fans were running the LED power was on, but did not display shit. During this ""phase"" it would not power off when I held the power button, I had to reset the PSU to shutdown.

I don't know if it's a Motherboard failure (why? would it be, stays powered on during bios, and during UBCD), could be CPU Failure (why? it stays on during UBCD).

Just discovered what seems to be a new virus. Has anyone else encountered this?

Trying to run a game program that previously ran fine, but blue screens now when attempting to switch video mode (IE use the video card).

On reboot, a strange thing happened: The computer asked me for my steam password. As I am permanently logged in this should not have happened. I wondered if someone was trying to steal my login. Turns out they were.

Task manager shows ""phoenix.exe"" running. Turns out this is a bitcoin miner that uses your cpu. The problem is, *I* didn't install it. Also, a virus scan by AVG does not detect it as a virus, because it is a legitimate program that some people run on their PC to mine bitcoins. The problem is, someone is now running it on other people's pcs to mine coins. 

I simply ran msconfig and unticked these two lines:

""boot_update""  and  ""Keyboard Inf.""   

My concern is, that (a) AVG is not detecting it or warning about it
(b)It also appears to have a keylogger component
(c) It interferes with games (For me causes a bluescreen when I ran a game that requires a switch to fullscreen  at max res  - - I guess this interferes with the miner as the miner of course uses the GPU)
(d) I did not install this and even though I have disabled it I have no idea if it will come back OR where it came from.

Does anyone else have more information, and has anyone else encountered it yet?

Also, AV people, if you're listening, please add some sort of optional warning for bitcoin miners!

Anyway I bought Office 365 about one week later to be used primarily on my new desktop. The problem is that everytime I open Word and select a blank/uniquely stylized page, the program crashes and closes itself. 

I tried reinstalling Office 365 twice but I only get 5 installs. I have already installed two other laptops that have no problems opening Word as well as other Microsoft Office programs.

The only irregularity that I believe I did was immediately opening Word after installing it on the desktop. Since then, I shut down the laptops after installing Microsoft Office and then open Word. Word works great on those laptops.

TL;DR: Why does Word keep crashing on Windows 7's Office 365?

I recently got SpeedFan trying to diagnose the problem &amp;or fix the fan, though it won't even register any of my fans. 
Does anyone know how I would be able to fix this issue? This seems like it is just annoying but it will probably shorten the life of my machine.

I have no idea what the application is, the beeping is nonstop until reboot or logout.  It's very disruptive and very annoying.  I can mute it by simply turning the volume down but then obviously I can't use my sound.  I have checked crontab and it is empty.  I am not sure how else to track this down.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated in this very annoying problem.

In another section, under the employment history, I have the longest worked jobs separated by job with a bulleted list of the tasks performed for the each job under them. The first has 1pt or 2pt between lines, but all the rest have at least 5pt or 6pt between them. In my skills is a line by line list of each skill set, single spaced, but there is around 4pt-6pt of space between each line which is just too much. 

I know there's a way I can edit what the spacing is per line but I can't figure out how. If I could remove this extra spacing then I can easily have the resume down to one page so I can export to a pdf neatly and concisely.

Currently I am having this problem with my computer, as mentioned in the title, it would keep shutting completely off.  There are no blue screens, no mini dumps and nothing in the event log.  For about 2 weeks I have had a single line going down my monitor, which never really bothered me at all and just thought ""Oh well, my graphics card is probably going to die soon"" (It comes and goes.  Sometimes I can go hours without it occurring and others it will pop up after about 20 minutes, regardless of what I'm doing).  I heard about the beta for Path of Exile, so I installed it and played for about 30 minutes, and that's when my computer first shut off.  Thinking it might have just been some sort of crash, I decided to boot the computer back up and try playing again.  Making it about 10 minutes into the game, it shut off again.  Started it up a 3rd time.  Checked all of the temperatures of my graphics card and core temps, and nothing was above average, and then it shut off while at the desktop, game not loaded or anything (Mind you every time I booted the computer back up, it would tell me that it was not shut down properly and gave me the option to boot into safe mode).  After this last time, I booted into safe mode.  No crashes or anything.  Ran a virus scan, memtest, checked the registry for errors, checked the hard drive the game was installed on for errors and everything showed up clean.  Checking forums and the website, I noticed a lot of people were having similar crash issues with that game, so I uninstalled it.  Got into a game of Dota2 and after about 20 minutes, same thing happened.  However after this crash, when I turned it back on, my graphics card fan wasn't spinning and there was no signal from it to my monitor.  Thinking now that I found the culprit, I bought the same card off of someone from craigslist for like $50.  Installed the graphics card, and everything seemed fine.  After about an hour though, the same line showed up on my monitor in the same exact spot.  Reinstalled PoE and after about 45 minutes of playing, it crashed like before.  Uninstalled the game, and now everything seems to be working fine (except for that same line going down my screen).  Checked the voltages on my power supply and they are relatively close to normal (the 12v is about 11.6, the 5v is about 4.3, and the 3.5v is 3.3).  Also uninstalled the latest Nvidia driver for the graphics card and am just using the microsoft one.

So I'm curious to what you guys think.  Do you think it was the game causing the crashes or having something to do with it, or is there something else wrong with my computer (i.e. motherboard kicking the bucket, as the same crash happened once before without PoE being installed and I still have the same line going down my screen.)

This is my friend's computer, we built it about three weeks ago now and everything was fine for the first week. Played Bioshock Infinite on Ultra getting around 80-85 fps avg. Then he decided to OC his GPU with some program EasyTune 6 or something, it came with the motherboard disc. Then he played Bioshock some more and noticed the frame rate was down to 50's or so. Odd. At this point his computer blue screens and shuts down. He tries to restart it, sometimes it works, sometimes not. So he resets his bios and removes the OC on the GPU and everything seems okay. But then a day later or so it blue screens again. So he wipes the GPU drivers and leaves the card in. Everything works fine until he tries to install the 13.1 AMD drivers again. The only version he's used. It Blue Screens. Okay.. So I tell him that something got messed up with the drivers and corrupted something in Windows. So I convince him to re install Windows 7. He does, installs everything and it all works, no blue screen with the video card drivers or anything. It's all fine. Except now, when he tries to restart his computer via the Windows prompt it'll shut down, but when it comes back up his Motherboard Post beep gives him one loooong beep, then 3 short beeps. He can shut down via Windows, and the reset button works the way it's supposed to, same with the power button.

From what I gather any GPU related problems seem to be no more. I told him, to be safe, take out his GPU and boot the computer and try to restart it without the GPU and see if that works. If that does work then stick the GPU back in and see if the restart still doesn't work. And to reset his BIOS if it doesn't work -- with the GPU out.

Can anyone help with this? It would be greatly appreciated. It took me 2 years to get him to commit to a PC. Now he's regretting the whole thing because of these issues. I just don't want him to have a bad taste in his mouth for PCs/PC Gaming.

**Edit:** For those curious about an update, before we were about to try all these methods his computer restarted 3 or 4 times with no issue and there doesn't seem to be any problem, the POST beeps aren't there anymore things seem to be running smoothly. I myself don't think anything is fixed but if it's working and keeps working, I guess that's all that matters to him.

Thank you to anyone who helped out, you supplied me with some information I didn't know, as well as helped him learn a thing or two about problems with computers.

Having a very peculiar problem here. So far I've isolated it down to a possible motherboard problem but even then I'm kind of at a roadblock. $5 Paypal to the most helpful answer here! Here's a brief timeline of shit that happened:

-Fresh new Win7 build, operating without issue for about 7 days

-Installed some Windows updates, computer couldn't boot into Windows after restart: Just a blinking cursor in the top left

-Booted to DVD, Ran Startup Repair -- it worked. Everything back to normal.

-Attempted Shut Down later, Windows installed updates again...

-Same problem, only much worse: Not able to boot to DVD - it hangs after it says ""Windows Is Loading Files""

-Made a Recovery Disk, new problem: Sometimes it allows me to go to Advanced Options, other times it locks up after trying to load files to get me to that menu

-""Last Known Good Configuration"" didn't work, ""Safe Mode"" hangs at disk.sys and will not load into Windows. Googling that made me believe my SSD was the culprit.

-Burned an Ubuntu disc so I could at least boot into that OS. It gets about 5 seconds into the loading screen, then switches to Windows and hangs.

-Attempted to use Hiren's boot cd, but I believe it locked up. Both a regular and USB keyboard were unresponsive at the menu.

-Pulled out my hdd, set it as an external on another PC I have. Scanned it and ran numerous tests - no bad sectors or anything. It's a new hdd as well, and so far every diagnostic tool I threw it at indicated it was healthy.

-Out of curiosity I placed a new hdd in my PC and grabbed my Windows 7 disc to see if it'd allow a fresh install. Same problem - it freezes at the animation screen with the 3 orbs.

-Deciding that clearly my hdd wasn't the problem, I reset the CMOS on my motherboard, went into BIOS and made sure every setting was default.

-Placed my SSD back in to give it a try.

**And here is where I am now:**

-POST doesn't start right away like it did. When you power on, it displays a blinking cursor in the top left. After about 15 seconds of this, POST begins

-When it gets to ""Auto Detecting SATA1 Device..."" it takes close to 5 minutes to find my hdd.

-After 5 minutes of that, Windows starts normally.

-My 2nd hard drive, which I use to store media/big files is nowhere to be found. Doesn't show up in the BIOS or device manager.

If I didn't know any better I'd say the motherboard is having problems. However, Windows Updates are notorious for breaking shit so I kind of hope that it's something of an easy fix I haven't thought of. Right now I'm at work so can only control the PC in question remotely. Can't really mess with the BIOS til later. Hoping someone has had this problem and can point me in the right direction!

Also totally serious about the paypal thing.

**Update 3/22 10:00 AM:** Still no progress. I tested out a few games that push my system as a sort of stress test (to see if I'd get a BSOD due to hardware problems (ram, hdd, cpu, gpu) and all games I threw it at ran just fine. I'm going to try to swap out the PSU to see if that does anything. If not, I'll start removing components one by one until I can get POST to start right away and detect both my drives as quickly as it did befoe!

Windows XP Home Edition
Intel Pentium 4 CPU 2.20GHz (2 CPUs)
Intel 82945g Express Chipset Family Graphics 224MB

**RAM details**

Memory:

Maximum Memory: 4GB

Total Memory Slots: 4

Available Memory Slots:  0


**Questions:**

1) What kind of RAM should I look for? I get confused because I see ""DDR XXX"" and ""PC XXX"" and I don't know what they mean or which I'm supposed to use

2) Is it possible to mix memory amounts such as having 2x 512MB then 2x 1GB for a total of 3GB? Most configurations seem to be 512, 1gb, 2gb, 4gb, 8gb and so on, never in between, is there a reason for this?

3) If I wanted 4GB of RAM, does it matter if I use 4 x 1GB or 2x 2GB?

I'm running an Nvidia 660 Ti.  This all started yesterday when I was running a benchmark for a game and suddenly my PC froze.  I figured it was just an unfortunate happening, but when I tried to restart the PC, it wouldn't finish the Windows 7 booting sequence.  It would get to the ""Starting Windows"" screen where the lights fly in and make the logo, but between that screen and the login, it would just go black.  My second monitor would act like it was trying to find a source when it got to that point, but it never did find anything.

I've spent most of the day today trying to find a solution to this, but so far no luck.  I've tried uninstalling the drivers and installing the newest version (314.07), but that did nothing.  Instead, once I uninstalled the drivers, and it installed the standard VGA adapter driver, it make it past the login screen.  This is not acceptable since i'm a gamer, however.  It also will work in safe mode (which I know only uses a basic driver), and it works when I disable the adapter from Safe Mode and boot normally.  I've tried installing an older driver (all the way back to 306.xx) but the issue repeated.  I got desperate and reformatted my HD and reinstalled Windows, but when I installed the drivers again, the issue popped back up.

I've read online that there's some kind of issue between some Windows update and the Nvidia drivers, but i'd have no idea how to go about fixing that.  Any help you guys can give would be much appreciated!

Update 1:  In safe mode, I tried uninstalling the drivers completely, used Driver Sweeper to make sure all of the drivers were truly gone, hit the registry with CCleaner until it said there were no issues found, looked for hidden drivers (there were none), installed the driver and restarted.  After all of that, its still happening.  I did notice that after running Driver Sweeper and rebooting, I could Analyse with the software again and there'd be at least 2 nvidia drivers listed.  They didn't seem to be able to go away, possibly just something on the card.  Also, now when Windows opens it pulls up a Command Prompt and asks something like ""C:\\nvidia.* ? y/n"" and idk what that's all about.  Also in Programs and Featues, there are Nvidia drivers listed there, but I can't get them to go away either.  I hit the uninstall button and the mouse changes to the loading wheel for a second, then it just goes back to normal.

Basically I turn the thing on, and whatever the first image it's starts up with, is frozen on the screen for an extended period if time. Periodically, it will catch a new image and stick that on the screen for a bit, and most times, it will actually fade the picture to white for about 15-20 mins before actually rendering the video in real time.
I should mention there are no audio issues.
Other notations: 1. The tv is only hooked up to an Xbox, no other sources. 2. Also, I noticed the issue happened shortly after I switched from an AV cable to HDMI. I tried reverting back to AV, but this did nothing to resolve the issue. 3. There was one occasion where something jostled the tv and that actually ""snapped"" the video back into functioning, but I would like to avoid banging on the thing if at all possible.

Help!",violettheory,5,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/17vfws/brand_new_battery_for_my_laptop_sucks_just_as/,"Okay, so my laptop is going to be two years old in May, and I've had the same battery since then. These past few weeks the battery really quickly became total shit. Like, 40 mins on full charge. It got to the point where it wouldn't even warn me before it just cut off so I decided to keep it on the charger when I used it until I got a new battery.

Okay, here's a little bit of background. I've had other weird problems with my laptop before this too. For instance for about a month last year my battery just randomly decided it wasn't going to charge anymore, and it had to be plugged in to even turn on. I took the laptop to this battery place and asked them what was up. The guy tested the battery and said it was fine and that there was probably structurally something wrong with the laptop. I was preparing to send it away with some guy when I discovered that it miraculously started charging again! I had no idea what happened with it but it hasn't happened again. 

Alright, so last Friday (four days ago at time of post) I bought a brand new battery from the same place. I explained my problems to the guy (told him about how it would randomly cut off and stuff even when it wasn't overheating) and he said that my shitty battery was causing that. He got me a new one, we tested it out, everything seemed good. He told me to let it charge completely then use it until it dies a couple of times before I started using it normally. He said I should get 4-6 hours off the new battery.

So, jump to that night after I had let it charge completely. I turned it on and my laptop said that a full charge was just over two hours. It wasn't what I was expecting but I figured that my computer was just maybe underestimating the amount of charge. Well, I'm just surfing the internet and what not and my laptop completely shuts off when it has about 60% battery. I thought at first it overheated because it does that quite often but it was on a cooling pad and wasn't hot to the touch. I finally discovered that it died. It wouldn't turn back on until I plugged it in again. When I turned it back on it said it had 4% charge. I was very frustrated but decided to shut it down and let it charge all the way again. Ever since then I've got a full charge of about an hour to an hour and a half, which is definitely not what the guy promised when he sold the battery. Hell, even right now it says 40% is 24 minutes. I really hope I just got ripped off with the battery but I'm really thinking something is wrong with my laptop. Any ideas?

Here's my laptop information: HP Probook 4720s Windows 7 64 bit, about a year and 8 months old, and I got it from Tiger Direct if that matters. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I really want this problem fixed, it's driving me crazy!

EDIT: Someone in the comments asked if I had a battery regulator program. I have something called HP Power Assistant. It just tells you how many watts you're using and what your charge is... no options to calibrate battery etc. But it does say this in scary red letters:

PA has encountered a missing or invalid database condition. PA has disabled predictive battery life and power consumption support.

Any idea what this could mean? Could this mean a bad connection between my battery/laptop?

UPDATE: Okay, for some reason 76% battery is 1 hour 25 mins now... This isn't ideal by a long shot, but it sure as hell is a lot more than it has been. I haven't had a chance to do any of the things you guys were suggesting, I was actually about to get to it when I discovered the unnaturally long battery life. What could cause this influx in charge?

So it was time to redo my main boot drive and do some spring cleaning, so to speak, and that drive was actually two Intel 520 series SSDs in a RAID 0 array. I set up the array using my Asus Sabertooth X58 LGA 1366 motherboard's Marvell RAID controller before I was aware that TRIM functions or garbage collection didn't pass through a RAID array. 

Anyway, installed RST properly and all that on Windows 7 x64, and decided removing the original array through the Marvell utility and redoing it in RST would be the most expedient way of getting the clean slate I was going for. I'd already backed up everything--including a system image, at which point a repair disk was also created--onto a separate HDD I'd installed in my case. 

I was sure I was paying attention, and I'd skimmed through the PDF manual prior to trying this, but I must have missed the part where RST will unilaterally decide to include any other storage drive on your machine--even if you do NOT expressly select them during the RAID volume creation process--and somehow add them to the actual RAID volume. I'm not sure what's actually going on, to be honest, and I'm deathly afraid that I've formatted over all of my data on that non-SSD drive that was somehow included in the RAID ""volume"". I guess what I need is the quickest and most cost effective (free, hopefully, since I am a super broke idiot at this point) way to dig beneath superficial formatting and recover data from these other drives (there were two, actually). Thank you for reading, please help, it's a serious emergency! :(

**TL;DR: Tried to create RAID array with RST; RST decided all drives are part of volume; non-RAID drives potentially formatted/erased when added to ""RAID volume"" and don't show up in explorer; need to recover data from formatted drives!**

The laptop remains closed while I work and sits in a Dell dock where it charges and the monitors are plugged into that dock instead of the laptop directly. However, I would like to be able to use the laptop screen so I have three displays instead of just the two monitors. Is there any way to activate my laptop screen? As it stands right now, when the laptop is open the screen remains inactive.

I found a few forums that talked about this problem:

http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/210907-dell-precision-m6600-three-monitors

http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3519/t/19470274.aspx

But I am not sure I understand what if any solution there is. I'm assuming the problem stems from the fact that I am using a docking station?

UPDATE: I checked my monitors, one was using VGA and one was using DVI, both connected to the dock. I borrowed a spare DVI cable and replaced the VGA so both monitors are connected to the dock with DVI cables and then I restarted my computer to refresh the connections. However it still will not work. The computer is recognizing two new monitors, not sure why, and it will not let me extend to either on of them. One of the two says it is called SMB2030 and the other one says, Display Device on: VGA; however no VGA is connected at the moment. In the Catalyst Control Center it recognizes my laptop and two monitors, but will not activate the third monitor. Additionally, right now my laptop screen is active and one external monitor is active, the second external monitor is turned on and is displaying a box that says ""Analog.""

UPDATE 2: I went into my screen resolution preferences and turned off my laptop screen and tried connecting to one of the other two screens mentioned above. Neither on activates the second external monitor, however when connecting to the SMB2030 the first external monitor changes it's status to no longer being the main monitor and I loose access to all of the applications I was looking at previously because it is acting like there is a second monitor active, but the second monitor is not displaying anything and neither is the laptop screen. When I connected to the Display Device on: VGA nothing changes at all, and after disconnecting that one it appears to have disappeared from the list.

UPDATE 3: I have managed to fix my second monitor from VGA to Digital, and it will now connect and display properly, but I still cannot connect both monitors and my laptop.

Everything operates fine but when it comes to gaming, I feel as if it's not as strong as it should be. I tried borderlands 2 earlier today and the fps I got when playing was around 20-25 with everything maxed on 1920 x 1080. I've also tried a couple other games such as BF3 and Need for Speed: Most Wanted but the results are similar, the fps is not as high as it should be.

I've tried a couple solutions such as updating all my drivers and making sure the games used the gtx 670m as the primary card but to no avail. 
I also choose the performance settings on the battery whenever I would start a game. If anyone has any idea on why my laptop is so underpowered, please feel free to leave any suggestions.

Someone mentioned on another forum that my laptop might be not cool enough. ""As soon as the cpu and gpu reach high temps which they easily do on such a small case they downclock themselves.The result is a 2.4ghz running at 1ghz and 670m behaving like an IGPU."" 

Do you guys think this is really the case? If it is, I'm planning to buy a cooling pad but is there any other way to keep my laptop cooler when I'm gaming?

I'm looking for a faster solution. It's not mission critical data on the drive so I don't need a bit-for-bit clone. I tried a straight 'drag and drop' folder copy maneuver in Windows 7 but the process kept getting interrupted by attempting to copy 'invalid file names'.

Is there a simple file manager you guys recommend that would be best for what I'm trying to do? Ideal would be something that works like a local FileZilla, where it combs through the file structure of the source drive then initiates a file-by-file transfer to the destination drive that I could monitor and pause/resume. But I'm open to any other methods that might be out there.

Appreciate any suggestions. Thank you.

I switched out the graphics driver for the most recent one (I was experiencing frequent VPU recovers), hoping I could get some kind of monitoring with the Catalyst Control Center (but that wouldn't install!)

* My original OS install was on a 300GB HDD which is now out of commission and unplugged from mobo
* I backed up a bunch of files via the old OS onto an external HDD which I am still using with new OS install


When I try to access the external HDD from my new OS install to move files over, I don't have any access privileges. I have tried taking ownership (even via cmd prompt ""TAKEOWNERSHIP /F \a \r""), adding *Everyone*, *myself* and the *Administrators* as users with full access - I still can't copy/open the files.

Plot twist: the only time I can access my files are when looking at some particular files (not a folder or the entire external HDD) &gt; properties &gt; security [and see this.](http://i.imgur.com/0ztu2.png) I have no idea what any of those users are, but if I allow all permissions on bottom one, I get full access to my files (view, read, write, move, etc). However, those users don't appear if I check the security settings on the folder level or the entire drive. Also, not every file seems to have those users.

So, what can I do? I am assuming those users are a remnant of my old OS install (even though this external HDD was just used as mass storage) ...anyway I can set permissions to the entire drive like I can those random files?

**EDIT** 

I am making some progress - it seems if I give each individual folder full access via an added *Everyone* user, I can recover the files. However, there are hundreds of folders and subfolders, and this will take forever to do manually.


**EDIT 2** 

Ok, this method is also working with my user name (which is the only user on the computer). The issue is still that I can't apply this ownership to the entire drive (even though I have the ownership selected to spread across all files, subfolders, etc) in one swoop - I have to manually apply this to every single folder and subfolder. That will take hours upon hours. Am I missing something?

**EDIT 3**

Ok, this might have fixed it. [I added this to the registry](http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1911-take-ownership-shortcut.html?ltr=T), even though I didn't think it'd work as I did that manually already. I took ownership of the files with the new context menu option (replaces ""Run as Administrator""), then set full permissions to anything that didn't have them. I went to copy the files and ...9GB copied so far with no hang-ups. I'll wait until all 220GB are copied, but I think I may have got this in the bag.

**EDIT 4**

Yes, that did the trick.

1. Is that card in fact only compatible with HP workstations?

I have had a strange problem lately. I had been using a pair of great Turtle Beach DPX21 headphones and one day last week they started only playing audio out of the right side.

I thought this was strange so I checked all of the balance settings and did a few tests on YouTube for left/right channels and nothing seems to work. The audio works out of my speakers just fine. Today I finally filled out a support request with Turtle Beach and hopefully I can have the DPX21 headset replaced.

I started watching a movie just an hour or so ago and decided to use another pair of headphones. After plugging them into the same (front) audio jack on my custom built PC, they were working fine. I paused the movie and came back to watch some more about 10 minutes later and the audio is only coming out of the LEFT side.

It felt risky but I tried again with other headphones and the same thing happened. Audio out of both channels, then out of nowhere it comes out only on the left side.

I tried plugging all 3 pairs of headphones into other devices and the audio is only coming out of the one side now. Did I just ruin 3 pairs of headphones? Is my headphone jack completely screwed? I'm losing my mind here, and any help would be seriously appreciated. Thank you!

This is what I have done... I have installed the drivers (All of them) for Windows 7 32-bit [Using it as a place holder until I upgrade to Windows 8] and I have plug in everything in and out, twice... its crazy

Any help would be welcome to try and help me out.

(Yes I have Turned it on and turned it off)

 when the power came back on i started my computer up to see if any damage had been done, it worked fine but the next day the i was using it and the screen randomly went blank yet the computer was still running. this happened a few more times over the next week and the frequency of it happening gradually increased.

last night it did it but my computer recovered from it and a notification came up saying that the graphics drivers had crashed, i reinstalled the drivers but it happened again so i plugged my vga cable into my other graphics card to see if that was the problem, after a couple of minutes the drivers crashed again.

I did a system restore back to before i had installed the latest driver ( nvidia 306.97 drivers for series 500) , downloaded the drivers again then reinstalled them, this fixed the problem for a few hours but then my computer started randomly shutting itself down randomly. at this stage it was getting late so i decided to shut the computer down, it shut normally at first but when the screen went off i noticed that the fans were still running and i had to hold in the off button to get them to turn off.

i wake up the next morning and start up my computer and it was fine for about an hour but then shut itself down randomly and now wont start up, or runs for a bit then shuts down. i did a google search and by what i found it could possibly be a power supply problem or a mother board problem, if its the motherboard i have a new one on the way anyway. how do i find out which or what is the problem?

I'm guessing this is why I'm finding it so difficult to find a solution. 

Also, I've not tried moving all the clean files off the external and formatting the hard drive yet as I'll save that for a plan B if required. 

So here is my problem. 

I have a folder full of corrupt data as shown on the screenshot here:
http://i.imgur.com/6dcV1.jpg

Then if I attempt to delete the files, rename or move I get the following error message:

http://i.imgur.com/5hZSO.jpg

So I'm assuming that the original content is lost now and unretrievable? 

And what can I do to remove these bad files from my hard drive?

Thanks in advance, any help is greatly appreciated!

UPDATE: I've fixed it. Simply right clicking on the TrueCrypt volume within the TrueCrypt menu gives you the option to 'Repair File system'

To which it fixes the corrupt data! I did lose the data but I now have the corrupt data removed! Thanks for you help all!

It happened out of nowhere and I have no clue why.

Could it be the hdmi input on the actual video card (the one the mini-hdmi adapter goes into.), or maybe the video card itself? It's only 2 months old.

The problem occurs frequently while playing games but can happen after hours of play. When the computer locks up, I am still able to move the mouse, enter the task manager but runs at glacial speeds.

Now I have had problems with overheating before, but am unsure if that is the problem here because I've never seen my CPU temps over 60 C. Also with Overheating my computer has always just shut off quickly.

The last hardware change I made before this problem started was upgrading my DDR3 from 4 GB to 16 GB. Am unsure if this could be a problem since it ran fine for a month of 2 before the problem first occurred. 

My PC Specs are as such:
Mobo: ASUS P8Z68 Deluxe

Graphics: Radeon XFX 7850
Memory: Corsair Vengence 16 GB 1600

I switch between using XP and OS X on my macbook, using XP mostly for games. I connect to my modem via WIFI.

Recently I got a new modem from my ISP. The first few days I didn't notice anything, but a few days ago my ping in games etc. got very unstable in XP. It could be around 10-15 for some time, then 300-500 for some time and then 3000-5000 for some time, seemingly at random. 

I've made sure that there's nothing on my network that could be taking up bandwidth, and having observed it for some time it seems it  only happens in XP. My ping in OS X is stable at 10-16.

I've checked with my ISP making sure there's nothing wrong with my connection to them, so I guess the problem has to be with my modem, with windows XP on my computer or the connection between the two. However, I'm at a loss trying to figure out what it might be.

Any suggestions? I've tried updating my network cards' drivers.

My modem is a Zyxel p2812, and I'm running a fully updated windows XP (as fas as I know).

**Edit:** Some additional details.

At my computer station my signal strength often jumps between 1 and 5 bars. First I thought this might be part of the problem, but after putting my computer next to my modem, where it has 5 bars stable, the problem persists. 

Also, somewhat weird, not all applications seem to be affected by it. I've tried pinging a stable website for a long period of time, and my ping rarely goes over a maximum of 250 ping, and stays at an average of 20. However, applications like Ventrilo or League of Legends can get a ping of 5 000 or more for several minutes.

I've had a netbalancer running in XP to see if any hidden applications are using a lot of bandwidth, but it doesn't seem to be the case.

**edit 2:** Further details
I've tried placing another cumputer running windows 7 next to mine at my computer desk. Having vetrilo up and indling on both I can observe the ping staying stable and low on the machine running windows 7, while it's wildy unstable on my machine.

Worth noting is that the signal strength on the windows 7 machine is pretty stable at 2/3 bars, while mine keeps jumping, also the connection speed is always at 300 Mbps on the windows 7 machine, while on mine it keeps jumping between 5 Mbps and 130 Mpbs all the time.

I have noe clue what might cause this. It was pretty much fine a few days ago. I'd prefer not to reinstall windows, but I guess that's what I might have to do.

[](/solved)

**Edit 3:** I fixed it.
After some time I finally figured it out. I thought my network card drivers were up to date, since Windows couldn't find any newer ones. However, upon inspection, my drivers are from 2008. With my new modem I got a WPA2 encryption, where as my old modem had just WPA. Apparently, with my drivers being old, my network card couldn't handle WPA2, making it choke sometimes during encryption/decryption. I couldn't find any newer drivers for my network cards chipset in XP, so I ended up switching the encryption, and that solved everything.",,False,,t5_2rv00,1349079083.0,,,True,t3_10ph35,http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/10ph35/unstable_ping_in_xp_but_not_in_os_x_on_same/,

Sorry about that.

I'm trying to restore a partition on a [640GB drive](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822152237), but the partition is apparently much larger than the drive.

[Here's what TestDisk says.](http://i.imgur.com/ZRSsE.png)

The cause of all of this trouble was started by attempting to expand the drive over ~50GB of empty space on the front of the drive. I ended up having Windows try to create some sort of special drive (""Hybrid""?), which instead listed the ~50GB of empty space and remaining drive as this new type but didn't give me any access to the ~50GB. I then attempted to revert and deleted the partition. Attempting to restore it yielded what you see above.

This is an assumption, but the partition is 52GB larger than the drive, so my guess is that Windows fucked up and made the partition 52GB larger than possible (the drive was nowhere near full) than full.

Help? In reality, I only really need to get my Mass Effect 3 save off of the drive. Most everything else was unimportant, despite the name of the drive (Backup).

* Intel Core i5-2500K Sandy Bridge
* ASUS P8Z68-V LE LGA 1155 Intel Z68 Intel Motherboard with UEFI BIOS
* G.SKILL Ripjaws X Series 16GB (2 x 8GB) 240-Pin DDR3 SDRAM DDR3 1333

* OCZ Solid 3 SLD3-25SAT3-60G 2.5"" 60GB SATA III MLC

Now my problem is that if I let me computer just sit idling for several hours, sometimes when I come back I'll see the BSOD stop code 0xF4. Now I've seen that it has something to do with a process being terminated but I don't know what to do. Also, it'll sometimes go to the BSOD after watching several Youtube videos and just a little bit ago the BSOD came up after I just tried a google search.

I've already checked to make sure in the BIOS that the RAM is at the right frequency and I'm not overclocking anything. Also, I've make sure all the power cables are secure and everything is firmly secured into its slot. This problem was going on for a while in June but stopped for awhile, then started up more frequently but now it's giving me the BSOD with the same stop code almost daily. There already new RAM and a new video card in BTW.

What could be wrong?

I notice it happens around the time my computer seems to be under a bit of stress like when i open a new tab when there is already one open or watching youtube videos and most depressing of all playing video games! 

So i took it to my repair shop and they said to simply reformat my hard drive that should do it! but go figure it did not after that they told me to buy a new graphics card because my nvdia hd 570 super clocked would for whatever reason just no work with my computer so i did what they said anndddddd

about a week into my new graphics card the problem starts up again! i still cannot watch videos or do anything stressful except play video games which is extremely strange

Ive noticed it always seems to happen around an update of some sort (video game update or windows updates things like that) I suspect its the drivers but for two different card?! seems pretty unlikely 

any help you can offer would do me a world of good I've spent so much money on this thing and done a lot of work id really hate to find out i have a dud

OS: Windows 7 Home

The gist: Bought third-party battery (battpros.com) that required BIOS flashing, in process of BIOS flashing Java popped up its damn update and crashed computer, now computer is bricked.

What I've done:

- Reset computer.
- Taken out RAM sticks, rebooting one inserted at a time.
- Disconnected CMOS battery for a least 5-10 minutes. Plugged back in and rebooted.

This was my wife's computer and she wanted a new battery. We purchased a third-party battery (battpros.com) that required BIOS reflashing. I thought nothing of it, did the process and then -- pop! -- Java wants to update the computer. Computer seizes and that's it. I reluctantly reboot and nothing. 

I feel like a complete idiot for doing, especially since its my wife's laptop.

Question: How can I recover the BIOS? Is there some kind of BIOS recovery tools available for Sony Vaios, or am I shit out of luck (without sending it in)? I've considered replacing the motherboard, but it seems a little pricey out there for a new and/or used one.

I'm taking a break from this for a couple of hours. I've scoured the web for information about it and I can only conclude I've bricked it.

Thanks in advance for the assistance.

It ran Windows 98, used Microsoft Works as a word processor, had no internet access, and did not recognize USB mass storage devices. I decided to abandon this system altogether when I got this computer, so I wanted to moved all of the files from that computer to this one. I was told that the best way to do this would be to get a hard drive enclosure, so I picked up a Sabrent 3.5"" SATA/IDE hard drive aluminum enclosure and took the hard drive out of the computer and put it in the enclosure.

Unfortunately, I have yet to be able to get to my files. It has trouble installing, I suppose, because it refuses to show up as a USB mass storage device in My Computer. Clicking on the 'USB to IDE Bridge(Ant 6390) Generic Win98 Driver Setup_v1.00' on the setup disc tries to install it and eventually yields the following warning: 'This program just can run on Windows 98/Windows 2000 below SP3!' I thought that perhaps it would help to try a file on the installation disc which is called Setup WIN98 DRIVER, but the computer tells me that this is only for use within Windows 98. Any advice would be much appreciated.

The computer I'm trying to put it on is an HP laptop running Windows 7.

I start it up in safe mode and it runs for however long I leave turned on. Later I tried turning off all services and startup programs and go one by one to see which one is the culprit, problem is that even with all that disabled and booting it normally, it still freezes, so now I have no idea what to do.

As you probably already figured it out, I'm not completely computer savvy. I'm running Windows Vista, any additional info I can provide.

Also, I don't know if this is relevant, but the problem started shortly after the pc was turned off accidentally with the on/off switch on the back because it was being moved a bit.

So, my SO's computer has this weird issue that I really really don't understand. I'm quite a noob and have no idea where the problem could come from: I'm hoping anyone has an idea, so I might be able to fix it. The computer is a Dell (Studio XPS 435MT) that runs on Vista Home Premium (servicepack 1). The problem is that whenever I turn the computer on, the internet connection is not working. After waiting for 10 minutes it will work, and it will continue to do so, as long as I'm *actively* using the computer. If I use software that makes no use of an internet connection (say, notepad) the connection won't drop; if I browse reddit for hours, the connection won't drop; and here comes the weird thing: if I put on a playlist at 8tracks.com or w/e and go chill on the bed, it will play for hours. However: once I return to the computer and move the mouse, the connection drops. It will generally take 15 minutes before the connection is on again. So even using a website or program that keeps connecting to the internet doesn't prevent the connection from dropping but *it only drops once I start to use the computer again*. 

Seriously, what. It's very annoying, and the only way I can prevent this is, like I said in the title, moving the mouse or hitting a random key every ten minutes. It's no problem while I'm working but it gets really annoying if I'm just using it for playing online music or whatever. My internets should work whenever I want them to!

So, anyone got any idea what this could be based on? Might be worth mentioning that my SO never had this issue until he moved to a different place.

I've tried looking for replacement screens online and getting someone to fix it, but I can't find the right model or it's unavailable and I don't have time to wait.

Computer - Lenovo s10-3t with Windows 7 Home Premium
Modem - Motorola SB5101U Surfboard cable modem (connected to Charter)

I wanted to rename my router and password (Let's call the old name ""HAL""), but I forgot the username and password to access my router's utility. I figured I would just reset the router by pressing and holding the router button for 5 seconds (this is the recommendation in the user manual)(EDIT: I mean more than 5 seconds and have later tried 30 seconds too). The router reseted fine, and I can connect wirelessly to the router and access the utility through firefox; however, the router itself will not connect to the internet, even after doing an EZSetup program. I have tried many combinations of restarting the computer/router/modem but no luck.

Strangely (to me at least), when I connect my computer via Ethernet to the router and then the router's WAN port to the modem, it will connect to the Internet (hence accessing Reddit). My computer recognizes the LAN connection as ""HAL"". I can simultaneously connect to the wireless connection (now reverted to the name ""default"" after the reset"") and the LAN.

As I remember a couple of years ago when I first set the router up, all I had to do was run the EZSetup program, and I was on my way. Now it seems as though the router won't actually ""reset"" to factory settings if my LAN is being recognized under the old name ""HAL"".

How to I really reset my router to start all over at the beginning?

Thanks, going to bed now so I'll respond to any further q's in the morning.

Update: 8/10, ran myself on ethernet for a few days because I didn't want to deal with it. Unplugged my cable modem, then replugged it in. Then I plugged in my wireless router and connected the modem to the WAN port on the router. Anticipating having to implement some of your suggestions, I tried to connect to wireless and it connected to the Internet. I literally did nothing to reset anything or change any settings. I guess time heals all wounds. Thanks for your help everyone.

Hi guys,

So, recently I've plugged in my backup drive which I haven't used for about half a year (used mainly to store stuff I don't use anymore), however now it shows only the drive but no details.

Trying to access it normally causes an error: ""This drive needs to be formatted"" to pop up.

I've tried using testdisk to append the structure to no avail. Unfortunately, since I got this disk a few years back, its a single partition disk. 

Using Chkdsk /f shows some 3 bad sectors, but it hangs at the point where it goes repairing volume bitmap.

Currently trying to use testdsk to copy the files over to a new spare drive, but it doesn't seem to be copying fast, would that be normal? I have a couple of big files in there (videos) and pictures of graduations to pull out.

Is there any other alternatives I can use to access and pull out the data?

Thanks in advance for the help.

i then tried a fresh reinstall in legacy mode which seemed to go smoothly. However i only got boot times of around 18-19 seconds. While this is a decent boot time, identical laptops with the same ssd are getting 9-10 seconds boot times. 

also it seem to be getting worse. i tried tweaking some things in msconfig (which didnt help) and after restoring the settings back boot times have gone up to +/- 28 seconds again...

i came across a program called crystaldiscinfo while trying to google the problem, and the results seem to show nothing wrong: http://i.imgur.com/pvJnd.png

this is my first time trying to install hardware, so im not sure what im doing wrong. If anyone could help me out i would really appreciate it. i kind of stretched my budget to get this ssd, and so far the results have been a little underwhelming and frustrating :(

edit: just reinstalled completely in UEFI mode. before any drivers or anything has been installed it is taking 20 seconds to boot to a completely settled windows....this seems like it should be way faster i think? is it time to make a call to the retailer i ordered it from?

2. I tried physically switching the ports for the 2 drives after i had copy pasted everything there. When i started up my computer it told me windows 7 needed to be reinstalled, so i switched them back and it was fine. Im not sure exactly why it didn't work.

3.

Ok so on to the problem. We got the new ram (G.Skill Ripjaws X 4gb) and the computer booted perfectly. Then he restarted it, it no longer starts up, in stead it boots. then goes into a screen with some bars on the top of the screen. See [this album.](http://imgur.com/FhOkX,dz3G9) My apologies for the blurriness of the pictures, hopefully it can still be seen what's happening. So anyways. I used my win 7 disk to run the launch repair. That did nothing. I tried to get the cd to read again it never came up, after countless tries. I tried to get win 7 to boot off a usb, so I set that up. Plug it in, set it to boot off that. I said to remove all disks and media and to try again. Of course this makes no sense because it's just windows 7 on the usb. So I'm really not sure what to do at this point. Any tips you guys have I'd love to hear it, and if you have any questions feel free to ask.

About two weeks ago I built my own PC (specs below). It was running really well and I didn't have any trouble with it until about two days ago, when programs started malfunctioning and crashing all over the place. The problems included: 

* Chrome always displaying the ""Oh Snap!"" page
* Internet Explorer having the ""Internet Explorer is not working... trying to find a solution"" dialogue box pop up all the time
* Windows update failing to be able to update (even though I was connected to the internet)
* Microsoft Security Essentials failing to update, in the middle of a scan stopping, and saying that the scan had been stopped, and that it needed to be restarted
* Steam telling me that its installation had failed, needed to be reinstalled
* Sometimes getting the black boot screen that says ""a recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source"" and some other things

It seemed to me to be a virus, because the security programs were malfunctioning, and nothing else I could think of fit the situation. I looked up what to do on the internet, and a common suggestion was run Windows in safe mode with networking, and install Malwarebytes from another computer on to it and run a scan. When I tried scanning the first time, I downloaded the new database for Malwarebytes and ran a scan. It didn't come up with anything, and I closed it. I decided to open it again to run another one (just to double check), and it told me that the database was missing/corrupt, even though I had just downloaded it before. I downloaded it again anyways, ran it again, and it didn't find anything.

I was getting fed up with it, and I decided to wipe the drive (SSD) with DBAN, and just reinstall Windows. Well, I ran it once, and left while it was running. I came back, and all that was on the screen was ""Segmentation Fault"". I wasn't sure whether this was supposed to happen, since I've never run it before, so I went ahead and installed Windows. The installation didn't go that smoothly, I got a few black error screens (the same ones as earlier), and I think one blue screen, but eventually I got I made it to the desktop. Well, I installed motherboard drivers (**from an external hard drive that I hadn't wiped, was connected when I had the problems**) which went fine. Next I went to the AMD website and downloaded the Catalyst 12.6 Suite, and tried to install it. Well, I went through the installation process, but when I finished and tried to open Catalyst up, it gave me an error. I ignored it (there were enough problems already) and tried to install MSE, installation didn't go that well either, when I ran it, same problems as before. I had more problems, and I decided to try and wipe it again. Ran it, reinstalled (again, not super smoothly), and I had all of the same problems (I also used the external hard drive to install mobo drivers). I wiped it again, deciding this time not to use the external hard drive, except this time, I couldn't even install Windows. All I get are the black screens, and it isn't working. 

The only things I can think of are that I messed something up, and it's permanently damaged, or something like [this!](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/bios-virus-rootkit-security-backdoor,7400.html) happened. Those are the only things that can explain the same things happening over and over again after 3 drive wipes. 
I've probably done some stupid things (I don't think using DBAN on the same drive three times in a row is a good thing), but I have no clue what to do. I would really appreciate any help. I put as many details as I could in the description. Thanks for the help!

**TL;DR Computer was having problems, wiped drive, reinstalled. Problems persisted, wiped again, reinstalled, problems still persisted. Wiped again, can't reinstall Windows.**

So my brother, who doesn't know much about computers decided it would be a good idea to try and overclock his Intel i5 2400 cpu. Well if you thought the same thing as I did when you read that, you can certainly tell he doesn't know much about it. As the 2400 is not the K model which means the multiplier is not unlocked. Thus making it harder to overclock them. Now, I only have experience overclocking AMD chips, as overclocking mine and a good friend of mine. Anyways, he said he went up to 4ghz, which didn't boot (he's on stock cooling btw), so then he said he went down to 3.6ghz, which is still an absolutely horrible idea on those chips, he did no stress testing ie: Prime 95. And then the computer started freezing on him and he said he did a system restore, which made it work once again for a few days. Today is the first time he mentioned that the computer was not booting and he told me what had been happening. I took a look at it, to test it out, sure enough, the thing would not boot, it would start up, then proceed to shut off again, and then try and start up again. I then proceeded to, clear the cmos via the cap on the Mobo, taking out the battery, and then using the clear cmos button on the rear IO. All to no avail. Then for certainty I tried removing and reseating the cpu as well as applying new thermal paste to it. Nothing. So I now turn to you guys, what the hell should I do at this point?

**Specs include:**

* Cpu: Intel I5 2400
* Gpu: AMD Radeon HD 5770 
* Ram: 4 gb G.skill
* Mobo: ASRock Fatal1ty P67 Performance LGA 1155

**TL;DR**: Computer will not boot because overclock caused failure, it starts up and then shut down and automatically starts up again. Nothing happening after that. Nothing shows up on display either.

**Update:** I found out using the error codes on the motherboard, that it's the ram. As of right now I'm going to test it with mine. I'll report back when I'm done.

**Update 2:** Just put my ram in it to test it out. Worked perfectly! We're buying a new set right now. Thanks to all of you guys who helped out! Specifically Kid, you're awesome dude! :)

Intuit sent us a new pin pad device (Ingenico iPP350) to replace the one we'd been using (Ingenico 3010). The package contained a letter from Intuit saying that the old pin pad will not be supported after 7/31. We tried to install the new one and could not get it up and running after several attempts. Even though the device (iPP350) is listed as compatible with Quickbooks POS 7.0 on many retailer's sites, Intuit asserted and Ingenico confirmed that this is not the case, and an upgrade is required.

Only three pin pads appear in the drop-down menu under Quickbooks' hardware setup wizard; the iPP350 is not listed, and none of the others will be supported after 7/31. We really cannot afford to upgrade to a newer version of Quickbooks, especially since all other functionality remains satisfactory. Is there any possible workaround that would not require an upgrade? Maybe a way to patch our current Quickbooks software to add support for the new pin pad? Or possibly a way to run those sales outside of Quickbooks and then incorporate that sales info back into our data somehow? The new pin pad is a plug-and-play USB device that installed automatically to Windows (we're running Vista if that matters); it just won't work with Quickbooks POS 7.0.

As an alternate route I'm looking at open-source software that might give us the same functionality as Quickbooks, but this would be a less than ideal solution. We have all of our sales and inventory history from the past six years in Quickbooks, and it would be a major headache to move. Also we have merchant services through Intuit, and I know the business owners would prefer to stick with the devil they know, as it were. That being said, any and all suggestions are welcome!

I'm pretty sure it can't be a virus because I recently had it sent in to clean it of viruses and the like. And even when I scan for viruses I can't seem to find anything. The PSU isn't overheating and the whole tower is clean of dust and dirt.

Any suggestions?

The same thing happens on my mom's laptop. So, I figured it must be a network problem. Had a friend help me out by resetting the router and taking a look at the problem. Nada. Called my cable company for help; was told the router was capable of blocking sites. Called cisco for help, ended up buying a new router since the previous one was pretty old. Just finished installing it, but the problem persists. 

I have also checked firewall and antivirus settings. Nothing seems to be blocking google. 

I don't know what to do. Please help!

(X-post from Tech Support),metalbladex4,5,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/unvqk/alternatives_to_remote_access_xpost_from_tech/,"I work as an IT sysadmin for an office branch at the helpdesk. The networking team who oversees the whole division pretty much has complete control of the many operations within our division. My team of 4 people is in charge of about 150 computers using Windows 7. We perform upgrades for programs/OS, program installations, troubleshoot basic issues and work with the networking team to create accounts for users, add computers to the AD and set up email accounts on outlook.

Working against us at the helpdesk we do not have remote access is this consumes my office with work. Along with that is I am the only one with sysadmin rights. I use a smartcard to log my sysadmin account so everytime I can only help one person at a time at one location. My other techs have to use local administrator accounts but this can be time consuming since they have to turn off scforceoption in the registry. But even when they use the local admin account they don;t have access to their tools on the network drive even further delaying their work. The registry gets updated by the group policy after it restarts so it has proven secure. My techs are working on getting their sysadmin smartcards but that could be a 12 month process.

One thing I wish we had was remote access so sysadmins in our team could troubleshoot or set up things for the users like email on outlook, install programs from network drive, etc from our desks.

I know the networking team uses DameWare. I have asked for it from the networking team but they said it's not authorized to be given to helpdesk teams because they don't have enough keys for the program to install at all helpdesks in the division.

The OS images that we install on the computers we get from the networking team are hardened so I don't think we can activate remote access on the computer's OS and are scanned for unauthorized programs deemed by the corporation's head networking team and the network is also monitored. The new computers that get added to the AD get scanned before they are accepted.

Does anyone have any advice for me so I can overcome these challenges in a similar manner remote administrator would be able to lighten out workload? Maybe a program that cannot be tracked by the networking team or a workflow that someone has mastered?

Thank you, I hope that you guys can help me find a solution.

TL;DR: I am asking for help finding solutions to lack of remote administration access and lightening our workload.


[](/solved) : I managed to get windows remote desktop connection to work on my machine so now I can access other machines. Remote assistance is greyed out but I am working out to edit the registry to allow me to activate remote assistance. I'll first access their machine from my desktop with admin rights using RDC, edit the registry and activating the remote assistance on their machine.

Please Help Me!",OnlyEatsTacoBell,5,0,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/tsgo2/replaced_cisco_e4200_with_asus_rtn56u_having_the/,"So I've been at this since February. Here is my previous post regarding the issues I have been having with my Cisco e4200: http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/st489/cisco_e4200_keeps_power_cycling_tried_everything/

In the comments, it was suggested I get an RMA. It's been 3 weeks and CISCO has yet to send one after saying several times they would do so. So I got impatient and purchased an ASUS RT-N56U. It was highly recommended by a couple of co-workers, and it had the most consistent reviews.

The ASUS is having the same problems as the Cisco! I don't know why it's doing it. Here is what happens: I start surfing the web on my MacBook Air, and about 15 minutes later, it says I have no internet. When I try to connect to the wireless network again, it will timeout. I have to reboot the router several times before I can start using. Usually it takes me 5-15 minutes to get me back online. 

Some notes:

* This does not happen while doing hardline connections. The only devices hardlined are the XBoxes.

* I don't have to be doing anything on the MacBook Air in order for it to disconnect. I simply had Google Maps up to check traffic. Came back 10 minutes later to refresh and I was disconnected.

* When it disconnects, data on all devices drop. They say they are still connected, but no data is sent or received. This is different from the e4200, the router would actually drop the connection entirely. I can not ping the ASUS RT-N56U even if it says I am connected initially after dropping. 

I have suspected the issues lies within my MacBook Air because it only seems to do it when I use it. However, routers aren't magically resetting everywhere else I go, so something must be up. Other than that, I am having difficulties coming up with theories as to why two highly rated dual-band routers will not function properly. 

EDIT: Running wired right now and constantly pinging google so I know when the connection drops. I did have to reboot the router in order for it lease out an IP. Will update. Also of note, I am running Windows on boot camp on my Macbook.

EDIT 2: 

* As soon I enter my bedroom, my signal drops dramatically and the pinging of my router and google.com become unstable. When I am not in my bedroom (which is maybe 20 feet from the router) my responses are consistent (&lt;1ms for the router and 13-14ms for google.com) and goes to [this](http://imgur.com/9DubH) as soon as I enter my bedroom.

* I took my CISCO e4200 and hooked it up in my bedroom using an IP of 192.168.2.1, gave it separate wireless properties. I'll just have to switch networks manually when I move around the house (first world problem.) I wish I could bridge the connection, but every tutorial I could find, didn't work for me at all. Oh well.

Thanks to all for your help! Hopefully this setup will work for me.

It's a relatively new Linksys WRT160Nv3, which was running the stock firmware at the time this occurred. Recently, we upgraded it (I don't exactly recall which version, though), and today, it was upgraded to the DD-WRT firmware (the exact version: DD-WRT v24-sp2 (01/02/10) mini - build 13575M NEWD-2 K2.6 Eko).

As far as I know, no settings were changed, and considering I've done a factory restore and it still wasn't working, I don't think that would be the problem.

The thing is, pretty much everything else is working perfectly. The only thing that refuses is port forwarding. From what I remember, if the router firewall is turned off, all the ports are listed as closed except for HTTP (80) and one other one I don't remember specifically. If the firewall is turned on, though, they're all listed as stealth, but I still can't connect to them. Enabling DMZ also has no success.

I've also tried having my personal firewall turned off, but still nothing. I've started using this firewall after the problem began, though, so that's probably not the problem.

Forgive me it is my first post here in /r/24hoursupport if i make any outstanding mistakes. I wish to confirm if I have come across malware that prevents Ctrl Alt Del functionality to bring up the Windows Security menu and ultimately the Task Manager in Windows 7 with a fully functioning keyboard, I ensured the Ctrl Alt Del buttons worked with other computer.

-Symptoms:

Windows Security Menu (That screen with the options to log off/task manager/lock computer/etc) does not result after pressing in union Ctrl Alt Del.

-Cure:

After ensuring that the keyboard was not defective, nor that the keys (Ctrl Alt Del) were not defective by pressed individually or in union. I
used a macro recording program to macro the Ctrl Alt Del sequence to a single button that didnt involve the Ctrl Alt Del keys. I successfully arrived at the Windows Security menu!!
After trying the keybind again, I received a video error and my screen went blank. I went into Event Viewer and saw at the same timestamp 2 events **""A request to disable the Desktop Window Manager was made by process (4)"" and a second event logged right after was ""The Desktop Window Manager was unable to start because composition was disabled by a running application""** - What would disable a request to the Desktop Window Manger??? Malware??

Pressing Ctrl Alt Del now works fine and normally. I am concerned because malwarebytes and other scanners didn't find anything. And I find it odd that there would be a video error at the same time. Am I overstressing or have I found something that I should report? I could not find the ""process (4) it was referring to.

Unfortunately, these additional options don't fit nicely into the ""templates"" (what you see when you click ""edit"" over there------&gt;) and they'll have to be created as requested.

So if you'd like a Linux flavor (and/or icon) on your flair, comment in this thread. Or if you want the Android alien, or any other icon, let me know. Within reason, of course.

If I create a custom flair for someone, I'll also add it to the templates list. So check there first to see if you find what you want.

From this point on, I might get another ""blackout"" (so to speak) but rarely, and the game runs fine from this point. 

Sometimes when this happens a windows popup shows up and says ""ATI drivers have recovered from an error""... 

I have tried uninstalling / reinstalling drivers twice and that did nothing. 

Weirdly, when I run Starcrat II I do not get any of the errors, it just boots up fine and goes.

Out of the other 3 games, bulletstorm does it, Magika does it, and Call of Duty Black Ops specifically does it more than once - rendering that unplayable.

* First some background: I'm competent with computers and technology in general, so at lot of the time I know what I'm talking about. I've also got a family member who worked in IT/techsupport (not phone shit) giving me suggestions. He was basically the only tech guy at the company he worked for (network administrator and everything else) for 17 years, and the only suggestion he can give at this point is to get every part tested individually (which I figure is the only help I will get here, but I'm trying all my options anyway).The problem with that is, I don't really have the ability to test the parts individually: I don't have another computer that would be compatible with any of my parts. I live in a pretty small Tennessee town so don't I have any friends who have compatible parts. Not only that, but the only tech store in the area is run by an asshole who is worse than BestBuy with customers. He either is a greedy asshole and lies about computer parts/equipment or he is genuinely terrible with computers but thinks he does and treats everyone else like they don't know shit because of it (I think it's both). 

Specifications:
Intel i7 920 2.66GHz socket 1366
3 2GB DDR3 1333 by PQI
MSI X58 Pro-E LGA Motherboard
CoolMax CUQ-1200B 1200W PSU
EVGA 285 GTX Classified


So this all started in October (~the 16th) when I was playing Metro 2033. Had it on max settings, and after a little while of playing there started to be some visual artefacts, so I thought ""well I'll turn the graphics down as soon as I finish this battle."" I didn't have time, and it froze. Had to pull the plug on my computer to get it to turn off. It wouldn't start again. Nothing happened, no lights or anything. At the time, I thought it was the power supply. I also had another EVGA 285x (not the classified version) that I didn't have in the computer at the time and used it throughout because I know it worked beforehand.

* Got new power supply from CoolMax (replaced free), no change.

* Tried to get my motherboard replaced by MSI. Wouldn't give me a new one because of ""physical damage.""

* Got a new motherboard (EVGA x58 SLI3), but because of a combination of not having money and Amazon.com lying about having it in stock (nowhere else had it in stock), I didn't get it until around December 15th. Lights on the board worked and the fans/caselights would spin for about half a second and automatically turn off. Improvement but still nothing.

* Got my CPU replace for a new one by Intel. No change.

I waited to change RAM (even though I thought it was the problem), because PQI wouldn't replace it for free and I had no money, but now it was my only choice.

* Bought Corsair Gold 1200W PSU because I don't trust CoolMax. No change.

* Bought (got it today) G.Skill Ripjaw 2 x 2GB DDR3 1600. No change.

Some more info:

* Each time I got/replaced a part I tested the parts outside and inside the computer case to make sure there were no shorts being caused by it.

* Multiple tests each time, making sure everything was set and plugged in properly.

So, at this point, every single part in my computer is brand new (except the video card and harddrive) and it still wont POST. The video card is known to work, and a harddrive isn't required to POST anyway.

No idea what the problem is now; I'm going to try and get each part tested individually (I don't really know how I'm going to, though), but I'm open to any other suggestions.

**tl;dr computer hasn't worked for three months, I'm pissed, and I can't test parts.**

Next, let's say I'm playing TF2, BC2, or Killing Floor. If I transmit over ventrilo, the ping to vent rises from 100 to 3000ms. The ping in-game rises from 250ms to 800ms. After I stop transmitting, my latency for both will slowly decrease, but still remain relatively high!

I rebooted the modem, and the router, and went back to the same game server, and all pings were in the 50-60ms range, even while transmitting. Close the game, open a different one, and the problem re-appears!

**EDIT: The source of the problem has been identified, but a question remains. See my post in the comments. Thanks**


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My three-year old gaming computer is having some hardware-level problem that I cannot make sense of. Usually I can diagnose/fix myself, but this time it is beyond me.

------------Symptoms-------------

Symptoms occur from the start. Sometimes it won't POST. No video ever gets through (but my monitor detects that there is a signal), and my GPU fan just keeps spinning at 100% (which is what it does until the beep, which indicates that it POSTed without error). 

Sometimes it will get through POST, but it will notify me that there was a floppy drive failure, despite the fact that I don't have a floppy drive. When it gets far enough to tell me that my magic floppy drive failed, I can press F1 and continue to Windows. Once I'm in Windows all is fine for a while. I managed to play a game for fifteen minutes before it all froze up (I could still hear environmental noise from the game, but video froze, my G15 screen froze [which I'm sure indicates that the software running in the background in Windows is frozen], and none of the usual keyboard commands worked [ctrl+alt+del, Alt+tab, windows key])

Recently I have had problems with my keyboards working at all (PS/2 and USB) (never managing to get to Windows when this happened). Sometimes I can get far enough to hit Del to get into the BIOS, but no further input would have effect. Whenever I unplugged/replugged the keyboard, the three LEDs would flash (capslock, numlock, scrollock), but nothing further. My USB keyboard (G15) never works until Windows.


----------------History--------------

A little over a week ago my PSU failed (500-watt Ultra X-Finity). Before the ultimate failure, I would get a BSOD/restart and Windows Debugging Tools told me that it was a hard drive failure. I was all ready to order a new hard drive when the PSU gave its last breath and wouldn't turn on again. I got a new PSU (free; the one the failed was under warranty) and it worked great as I played for like six hours straight. No hard drive failure during those great few hours (I suspect the BSOD HDD failures were from the HDD not getting enough power). That was last night.

The PSU I had before supposedly had measures to prevent itself from killing the motherboard/CPU/anything else when it died. When it did go out, about half a second after it shut down (No BSOD when the PSU failed) all the lights on my G15 keyboard flashed for a moment, so there must have been some electricity going through the motherboard. But it all worked great last night, so I don't know if that is a problem.


-------------Further thoughts----------

The PSU is supposedly an upgrade because Ultra didn't carry my old PSU anymore, but it is a downgrade in a few respects. My old PSU had two seperate +12v rails, the new one only has one (but 28 amps!). It also has about 10 fewer amps on the +3.3v rail. [This is my new PSU](http://www.ultraproducts.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3255392&amp;CatId=1079). I don't think the current issue lies with the new PSU to be honest.

The RAM isn't an issue, I don't think. Today I managed to do a memory test from the BIOS, and it came clean.

The soundcard probably isn't the issue either. As I said earlier, when my game froze today the sound was the only thing working. Plus, I don't think the sound card would interfere with the POST. 

Overheating is not an issue either. My CPU hasn't been put through nearly as much hurt recently as it has, and it has a giant HS/Fan combo on it (Zalman 9700, a giant). I use Rivatuner to bump up the GPU temp:fan speed ratio, and when Windows froze today, I happened to have the G15 on the GPU temp page, and it was well within the healthy zone. I also checked the CPU temp every time I went into the BIOS, and it was always in the green for a start up. Plus, if the CPU was overheating, the system would straight-up shut off. It was an issue three years ago, it wouldn't just freeze like it did today.

I don't think the CPU is the problem because of the many hours of gaming last night and the fifteen minutes today. 

The video card likely isn't an issue either for the same reasons as above. No artifacts last night or today.

The optical drive isn't causing an issue, it was unplugged today. No problems yesterday when it was plugged.

I doubt the HDD is an issue either for the same reasons as the video card and CPU.

That about brings it all down to the motherboard. I don't have anything to rule it out, other than the hours of gaming yesterday and the fifteen today. But why would it work sometimes?

I have cleared CMOS half a dozen times today. No BIOS setting is causing this issue.

--------------------------------------------------------------

That is all I have to say. Congratulations for reading all of that, I wrote more than I thought I would. What I'm looking into now is flashing the CMOS, getting myself an updated BIOS. That is all I can think of for now, I'll let you know how it goes once I'm done. Thank you for any help you can give, I've exhausted all of my ideas. I'll put some specs down below for you.

Can I get a little help in this mug?

My old Asus A3H has a battery that will, at this point, last no longer than 2 minutes on it's own, so I'm looking to get a replacement. However the options are kind of dumbfounding me. 

There seem to be three options here:

*  Get a ""genuine"" replacement which specs out to 14.8V, 4400mAh, but costs $130

*  Get a battery with the appropriate specs to the original costing about $90 and are offered at those sponsored links on google like battdepot.com, battery-rebuild.com, etc. (sites I've never heard of before)

*  Get one on ebay from sellers out of HK selling the same spec'd battery for $40. I almost trust these guys more than the ""Ill-sell-you-a-battery-quick.com"" guys.

Of note, I've already tried the whole rebuilding of the battery pack with new cells thing on the spare battery, and that didn't work much at all-- the newly rebuilt pack only lasts about 13 minutes, and that was with new cells. 

So how should I proceed? Do any of you have good sources online for batteries? What's the deal with the cheaper ones, inferior cells? And if so, how would you know?

I've had the same router/modem for about 2 years (2wire 2701hg-b) and my wireless Internet has always sucked. It has begun to suck moreso as of late. 

   My Xbox has always been temperamental on the network (it was a miracle to not be kicked from parties every half hour) and my browser periodically showed ""No dsl signal detected,"" or got stuck loading pages. Now though, my Xbox will almost never connect independently, only after an hour of running ""test connection,"" failing at different steps and for different reasons, will my Xbox maybe connect to live for a few hours. 

   ATT has come out twice, doing nothing that I hadn't already done, but were still satisfied with the work they'd done. I've changed around many settings, read forums for help etc, and some of them had slightly helped or hindered, but none fixed. The interesting thing is, certain settings changes seem to fix it temporarily, before my internet reverts back to its original shittyness. 
   

   For example, changing the connection from 802.11 b/g to 802.11 b cleared up problems for a bit, and while my computer still seems to get the ""no dsl detected"" less, the xbox connection has slowly degraded into nothing. In the first while after this change as well as a few others the Xbox connection was ok, periodic drops but ok overall. Now it will almost not connect period. 

  A bit more background info, we have about 4 devices usually connected to the net, all wirelessly save for one of the PC's. Normal connections are 2 PC's, a mac, and an iphone, with others devices coming and going. The Xbox is a first gen with a wireless adaptor. 

I think that's about it, if anyone has questions or needs screenshots of something, let me know. Any help is appreciated, my computer area is slowly being destroyed as I break things in the Internets periodic absences.

However whilst this adaptor allows the monitor to be recognised and outputs to it, it will only output in 640 x 480. In addition instead of being recognised as an ""LG23EA63 Digital"" as it and all 3 of my monitors are, it is shown as a ""Generic Non-PnP Monitor"".

1376163363.0,5,self.24hoursupport,1k3qzs,Games for Windows Live overlay won't start [Win8] (x-post /r/techsupport),CaduceusRex,5,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/1k3qzs/games_for_windows_live_overlay_wont_start_win8/,"Hi all,

I recently purchased a Lenovo Y510p the other day. Pretty happy with it overall, but I've been having issues launching Grand Theft Auto IV: Episodes from Liberty City. Except for one instance, the GFWL overlay won't start when I try to play EFLC. The interesting thing is that I was able to get it to start the first time I loaded the game (i.e. freshly downloaded from Steam). I was able to run the in-game benchmark,  but when I exited the game to transfer my old saves from another laptop, it refused to start again. The error message I got was:


""Grand Theft Auto IV: Episodes from Liberty City has stopped working""


Initially, I didn't think it was a problem with GFWL because I had never had any problems with it on my W7 installation. Thus, I uninstalled EFLC, ran CCleaner, and reinstalled. This did not work. I am 99.9% sure that this a GFWL issue because I also this tested Microsoft Flight. It was able to start up (i made it to the start screen), but when it came time to load GFWL, it crashed, giving me the same error as EFLC. 


I have googled this problem extensively and have tried every solution that I could find. I have tried running GFWL as an admin in compatibility mode, starting from Win7 and going backwards. Didn't work. I have tried doing a clean install of Steam and EFLC. I tried a .dll trick that involves moving xlive.dll's from one folder to another. Didn't work. One solution that I wanted to try was to restore to the point *before* I had installed EFLC for the first time, however I didn't have a restore point created because I did not anticipate this problem. 


Because I have read many threads about how GFWL and Win8 just won't cooperate, I am almost tempted to just move on. However, because I was able to get it going (albeit only once), there must be a way to remedy this. Also, for what it's worth, I also had a similar problem with Fable: The Lost Chapters. I was able to start and play the game initially, but now it won't even load either (even after a fresh reinstall). I'm rather stumped by this, so I come to you guys for help. Thanks!



P.S. I'm off to work right now, so I won't be able to respond/update until later



DxDiag is as follows:

(i should also note that the Y510p has an intel integrated card and a nVidia GeForce GT 750M. i don't know why it doesn't show up under display devices in dxdiag, but i think it's because it defaults to the intel card when it's not running games)

I took the battery out and let it sit in rice for a week or so. I turned it on and it worked great so I tried to reconnect it to its owner, but the saved numbers in it were the skeezy hotels in town and a few scary nicknames like chainsaw mike. The previous owners text tagline was ""bobby@snitchsgetstiches.com"". I called a few of the recent calls and one of the saved contacts but the people on the other end were being extremely sketchy. They wouldn't tell me whose phone it was and one of them said he would meet me behind the movie theater in town. nope. the phone also smelled like it had been dipped in patchouli. I turned it off and threw it in my drawer, not really thinking about it for a while. I ended up breaking my phone about 3 months later and remembered this one in the drawer. I turned it back on, reset it and activated it with my number. At this point it still smelled like a hippy but worked fine.

Heres the catch: About twice a month, I will receive a call that appears to be from a saved number titled ""Get Sum :)""(which is not saved in my phone). When I open the phone, it automatically answers(which my phone is set to not do) and plays a weird midi song/ringtone. When I hang up, the call does not appear in my recent calls and doesn't show up on my usage either. When I googled the number, I found [this](http://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-768-667-6409) forum of people who had experienced the same thing but with even creepier names and sounds sometimes. I had verizon put up a 3rd party screen and block that individual number, so we will see what happens. Can anyone explain what is going on here? 

TL;DR: I get ghost calls on the drug dealer phone i found in a puddle.

I've had netflix for about 4 months or so now. I had zero problems until about a month ago. I began receiving the common error ""cannot connect to netflix."" Looked at the troubleshooting online, where it asked me to delete saved data and then 'reinstall'/login again to Netflix. That worked the first time. 

I'm now having this issue again except now, I've deleted the saved data, gone to enter netflix but I'm stuck on the loading screen. I don't even recieve a prompt to enter my email/password, just the loading screen OR another 'cannot connect' message. I've reset the Wii, unplugged everything, etc. I'm at my wits end here, help would be much appreciated!!

I downloaded and installed the driver for the controller, the receiver was installed succesfully when I connected it the first time. However, I try to get them synced up but no matter what I try, the controller's ring keeps blinking. Already tried to press the receiver's button for a while, wait for it to blink, then pressed the little button on the back of the controller to search for a connection, as soon as I press it the receiver stops blinking and the controller continues blinking the full circle.
Tried the method in which you go to device manager and update the driver on the unknown device, however, while installing it, this error message pops up: http://i.imgur.com/kyPpjrJ.png

I've been having a few issues with my computer lately. I'm just gonna jump right into it. Also I'm not sure this is the right place. If it isn't I apologize.  


Within the past couple months my computer started randomly throwing blue screens at me. I found out it was associated with the pirated OS that I had on my computer. I went and got a legitimate copy and now those issues are gone. However, in this time a new issue popped up. My computer won't start back up if it was turned off recently. I have to let it sit for at least 45 minutes in most cases. If I do try to turn it on it powers up but it doesn't POST. I've noticed that the CPU QLED stays solid on my Crosshair IV. If my CPU was failing or faulty would it ever get past this point?


This leads me to think that my mobo is on its way out. I've also thought the PSU might be to blame but I'd rather get opinions before replacing parts. My current setup is at the bottom of my post. I'll be available throughout the day to answer any questions that y'all might have. Any help is greatly appreciated. 


 It may also be worth mentioning that I had another BSOD today with the error: system service exception and a file listed dxgkrnl.sys but the computer froze at 90% of the file dump so I don't have a mini dump file to look at..

I tried to do bootrec /fixmbr and fixboot. After that startup repair wont fix automatically anymore. It said the problem has something to do with system config being tampered with.  Hard disk fails after a few seconds and would no longer boot up.

HDD: Seagate Barracuda ST31000524AS, OCZ Agility 3 AGT3-25SAT3-90G, and Western Digital WD Blue WD10EZEX


**Symptoms:**

Problem exists across fresh installs Windows 7, Windows 8, and (somewhat differently) Linux Mint

Difficult-to-reproduce hangs that occur during video streaming or video game play, characterized by audio hanging and repeating, video freezing, and input responsiveness halting

Nvidia driver frequently crashes and recovers

During hang, CPU rapidly fluctuates from 100% to 0% and various points in between

Occasional hang on startup, characterized by 30 second to 2 minute period where input is active, but system is unresponsive (can click on items, but nothing responds, portions of the windows turn black, cannot Ctrl + Alt + Del, says Windows is preparing security options)

Occasionally fails to boot, needs to perform startup recovery


**Steps to reproduce:**

Install fresh version of OS, wait for 1-2 weeks, stream video/play games, wait for hanging (which will reliably occur from that point onward, even after reboot)


**Temporary fix:**

Pull CMOS battery, reseat; fixed for 1-2 weeks


**Diagnostics:**


1) Ran Prime 95 overnight, no errors

2) Ran Memtest 86 overnight, no errors

3) Checked SMART status of all hard drives, results listed below:

Today I started up my laptop and when I reached my desktop my screen went blank and this message appeared. Sorry for the bad quality. I've researched it and found out that it's a virus named the ""MoneyPak"" virus. At the bottom of the message it also states I must purchase a MoneyPak card at my local retail store for 300$ and enter the code from the card to unlock the laptop. If I don't do this within 72 hours it says I will face criminal charges. It says ""I have been viewing or distributing Prohibitied pornographic contents (child pornograhphy was found in C:\USERS\'my name'\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files)"" which is **FALSE.** Another odd thing is that when I leave the message open, about 2 minutes later a monster like growl plays through the speakers which makes me doubt this is official. However it states, ""Illegaly downloaded material(MP3's, Movies, or Software) has been located on your computer. I have only downloaded one a couple of albums off the piratebay, but MUCH more on my other computer (which has no problems). My laptop has been running the default firewall and my norton subscription has ran out a while ago. When I attempt enter safe mode, after typing in my password ready to go to the desktop, rather than going to the desktop a screen appears and says logging off and shutting down. After these messages I am taken to the normal password screen to start windows. So bassically I can't access safe mode. I haven't tried anything else since. If anybody take the time to resolve this for me it would be greatly appreciated.

Thinking it was just a random error, I just tried to restart. However, this time I wasn't even able to make it into Windows. I would get a BSOD shortly after start-up.

I entered BIOS on my next try, and noticed something was way off: my CPU temp was listed in the high 90s. Obviously, my CPU was hitting the thermal shut-off point, causing all of the crashes.

To give a bit of a background, I installed an H220 on my CPU (4.5 OC) just two weeks ago. The installation was not the smoothest thing ever (didn't fit that well in my 500R), but I eventually got it in with the help of friend. I've been monitoring the temps rather closely the past few weeks, just in case I had made a mistake in mounting it. All was looking good, with lower temps across the board. Until today, that is.

I lowered the OC (back to the stock speed of 3.4), let my PC cool down, and re-seated the pump. When I pulled the pump off, everything looked good on the CPU, with the thermal paste evenly spread around. Re-installation went well, but when I powered the computer back on and entered BIOS, the temps were still off. When I started monitoring them, they were in the mid 50s, and slowly rising. I turned it back off after watching it rise to the 70s in only a couple minutes. When I felt the pipes after turning it off, I noticed that the portions of the pipe nearest the pump were very hot, while the parts near the radiator were completely cool. At this point, my friend and I concluded that something was wrong with the pump itself, as it didn't seem to be moving any water at all.

Luckily, I still had my old H60, so I took the H220 out and put the older unit back in. I haven't had any problems since, with my temps stable and well-within the expected range.

What do you guys think about this? Is it the pump, or is there some other problem? Should I try to RMA the H220?

I promptly spilled beer all over the keyboard (part #686836-001) and of course it no longer functions. Ideally, I'd replace the keyboard myself but I'm having trouble finding the replacement part. I have found exactly one [vendor](http://www.impactcomputers.us/) who has the part I need. They are charging $80, but I have no idea if that is a reasonable amount of money because they are the *only* source. Ebay and Amazon are no help. 

Anyone know of a website or vendor (preferably in the US or that ships to the US) that would have my part? 

Also, I have downloaded the repair manual .pdf and I believe I'll be able to do the repair on my own, but does anyone think it's too risky? Should I just take it to a repair shop?

____________________

This is for somebody else I'm helping with PC issues. Here's the problem broken down

**The issue:**

His computer (as of this afternoon) cannot connect wirelessly to the router at all. He is using a Belkin 54g PCI-E wireless network card. I don't know the exact model but it's a good few years old now.

It can detect the networks on the Wireless Utility, and networks do come up. The problem is I can't connect to them.

**Solutions I have tried:**

* Resetting the router and modem. Didn't work.
* Reconfiguring the utility's settings for our access point, by re-entering the WPA-PSK2 key.
* Repairing the connection via the windows network icon in the system tray. Ends up stuck on 'Connecting to the wireless network' for about two minutes then fails without establishing a connection.
* Restarting the PC. Numerous times.
* Reinstalling the Belkin drivers using the original installation CD, Wireless Utility and refitting the card. **This is how I fixed the problem last time (it's a recurring problem that seems to happen once every few months), however it is actually a pain in the arse to reinstall the network card and I'm looking for more of a permanent solution.**

**Operating system:**

Windows XP Service Pack 3.

**Questions:**

1. Should I bin the current card and get a new wireless PCI-e card? Out of all the threads I've tried to search for a solution with, one guy decided to return his card and get a new one.
2. Could a virus, trojan, or any kind of malware have caused this? I don't really see symptoms of an infected PC but I suspect it's the card itself playing up.
3. Should I consider trying to disable the Belkin Wireless Utility and using the built-in Windows utility? [One forum thread suggested the Belkin software was a load of horse shit.](http://www.techspot.com/community/topics/belkin-wireless-g-adapter-problem.70907/)

Basically my computer is unable to detect a system image on my external hard drive. I had previously deleted it to make room for another backup but wasn't able to make a new one (because I deleted the System Reserved partition, but that's another story).

I used Recuva, a recovery program, to recover some the files that were deleted from the backup. Unfortunately I don't know in what order/specific folder each file needs to be in, and so the the computer isn't detecting the system image. Also there is no VHD file and so I need to know how/if it's even to restore without a VHD file.

I had to use a generic Windows 7 disc install to get around the deleted System Reserved partition, to load the affected computer, but I need the specific Dell drivers and would love to get my files back so want the system image to load.

So, thanks for reading my post and for any help you can offer!

I've tried running lpksetup.exe in order to remove the language packs (which as far as I can tell aren't installed at all), but I'm just getting told that they cannot be removed after a short amount of time with no error codes or usable information to follow up on that.

I've also read someplaces that I should remove certain earlier updates, but can't seem to find out which. Some say to remove all Windows Updates and Security Updates, but that's close to 150 updates and then I'd rather restore the OS once more.


Does anyone know how to fix this?

EDIT: Some places suggest trying to install all the missing language packs, and I'm hoping to avoid this as it is somewhat time consuming. First time I checked the CBS.log file it said I was missing the Finnish language pack. I installed that one, and now I'm missing the Bulgarian pack.

I've tried connecting the modem directly to my PC and had no issues downloading. I've disabled the router firewall, which didn't help, and their DDoS protection is disabled by default.
If any other information is needed lmk. Thanks in advance for any assistance!

I have nothing to lose, really -- I have a recent backup and lately I've been doing everything in the cloud, anyway, so my data is not at stake. I also have a desktop PC that's new and fully functional. 

It was my very first time playing with hardware -- I've always been too scared of breaking the warranty before -- and it was surprisingly easy. Gently disassembling, very very gently dusting, figuring out what went wrong.

That third part was pretty obvious -- the plastic that holds the charging port in place against the outer casing had broken, so that when I push the charging cable into the port, it moves backwards and the connection is never made, so the battery won't charge. But every time I've had a port repair on a laptop or printer, even if nothing else is wrong, I've been told to buy a new piece of tech because it's too expensive to repair.

I've looked at ifixit (great site) and similar links, but Toshiba service information is scarce. Really I'm just wondering if there's a way to macguyver the port to the outer casing. Could I use a touch of glue  to secure it, do you think?

The laptop is a Toshiba Qosimo running Windows 7 Ultimate. It was repeatedly blacking out and back on with an error of """"Display driver NVIDIA Windows Kernal Mode Driver Version 295.73 has stopped responding and has successfully recovered"". I did some research and opted to do an upgrade rollback because it wouldn't stay on long enough to download an updated driver or anything. Now the computer says its card is a standard VGA graphics adapter and, of course, won't take a NVIDIA update. Can anyone tell me what happened? Did I kill the card? Was it ever there to begin with?

(Pictures/Info Inside),bruxc,4,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/1gr1ah/how_can_i_fix_an_issue_with_ie_and_other/,"Essentially, I work at a non-profit that hosts a Citrix Xen Neighborhood application to our staff. We currently are on Windows 2008 64-bit w/ IE.9. 

[Here is the issue](http://imgur.com/a/Yr2wl)

Notice how options like a properties window or the IE.9 add-in popup is hiding behind the taskbar. Usually it should be flush with it. 

A work around is to uncheck 'Keep the taskbar on top of other windows', but this seems to be confusing for our users when IE9 and other projects are in full screen. The taskbar becomes hidden. Again we could enable Auto-hide but that's not ideal either.

Could anyone help me with this annoying problem? It's been lingering since I got here and I am determined to fix this small yet irritating issue.

Here are my system specs:

Processor: Intel Core i5-3570K Ivy Bridge 3.4GHz
Motherboard: ASUS P8Z77-V LK LGA
Case: NZXT Phantom 410 CA-PH410-B1
CPU Cooler: COOLER MASTER Hyper 212 EVO RR-212E-20PK-R2

HDD: Seagate Barracuda ST31000524AS, OCZ Agility 3 AGT3-25SAT3-90G, and Western Digital WD Blue WD10EZEX

Issue: So for about a month and a half now, I've been having this issue that occurs during video playback and video games. Every once in a while, the video/game will stutter. It'll make this horrible hanging noise for about two seconds, and then it will run like everything is normal for about two seconds. This repeats until I turn off the machine.

Temporary Solution: After running tests on every component of my machine, I found that updating the BIOS completely fixed the issue. However, it fixed it for only about a month. The problem is now back, and I've found that resetting the CMOS (by pulling the battery) stops the problem for about two weeks. Now that's the strange part--it's as if something is changing my CMOS settings (or that something becomes more unstable over time). I do not overclock my machine, and I've run stress tests and diagnostics on most of my parts. The problem occurs even when I'm running on the Intel HD 4000 chip (I pulled out my graphics card to test that). Any idea on how I can go about figuring out the issue?

Anyway, my issue is that my PC will stall/crash while either watching a stream or playing a game. By stalling, I mean the screen freezes and a repetitive zzz like noise comes out and I have to manually reset PC. If I try to start it again straightaway, the PC emits a long beep and the screen stays black. After waiting a couple of minutes to start it after it crashes, it usually starts ok. 

This has happened maybe 10 times in past 5 days. Before this I had 18 months or so of zero issues. The streams are from [twitch.tv](www.twitch.tv) and the game is League of Legends, though I'm sure it would occur with any game. 

Like I said, I don't know much about PC's but having talked to a few people and used some software (SpeedFan - don't kill me) it seems to be two problems. My GPU gets hot. Idle its about 51-55 and then when playing games/watching videos it goes up to 62-64. I cleaned the inside of my PC over the weekend but that only lowered the temps for a day or so. My other theory is that my PSU is insufficient. I looked at the readings and 12V and 5V were fine but 3.3V was low - 1.84. Those are just my theories really so they are probably way off. My query is if anyway can figure out what my exact issue is, and what I can do to fix it.

My Specs

 * Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium
 * ixtreme M5722
 * x64-based PC
 * Intel Core2 Quad CPU Q8300 @ 2.50GHz, 2499 &gt;Mhz, 4 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s)
 * Installed Physical Memory (RAM)	6.00 GB
 * Total Physical Memory	6.00 GB
 * Available Physical Memory	3.43 GB
 * Total Virtual Memory	12.0 GB
 * Available Virtual Memory	8.89 GB
 * NVIDIA GeForce 210 512MB

Sorry if I put in too many specs, or not enough! I would really appreciate any help or advice.

Thank you for your time.

I am a big gamer and PC user but I've always used Windows 7 mostly because of my games I play - ArmA etc. 

All my friends tell me to dual boot Ubuntu (I loved the UI and the system when I tested it once before) and Windows 7, they said that I could just boot W7 when I want to play games. But god, the restarts... I was thinking of an emulator but that's even worse because all apps doesn't work in emulators like Wine.

So is it worth it? I can always remove Ubuntu if I realise that I did not really need it.

For the past couple of days, the display has been exhibiting a tremendous amount of distortion in the form of vertical bands and dots. I understand that this usually implies a fried display or graphics adapter. There are however, some interesting observations in my case:

* The BIOS configuration console loads up without any distortion.
* Pre-boot screens on both Ubuntu 13.04 and Windows 7 exhibit no distortion.
* I tried connecting an external monitor to the VGA connector on the notebook. The distortion gets reproduced on that as well.
* [Screenshots are somehow able to capture the distortion on both Ubuntu and Windows.](http://i.imgur.com/GF3qfKo.png) *Should this even be possible, assuming a hardware fault?*

Drivers for the graphics adapter on are up-to-date on both OSes. The adapter is an Intel GMA X3100.

So the guys I bought it from got a new lamp and replaced it, and I picked it up today, and the image, while brighter than before, retains the green tint.  This leads me to conclude that it's a problem with the LCD element somehow.

The Question is, is this something that can be replaced/fixed?  I kind of would be willing to pay any amount for it, due to sunk cost fallacy, but it is a rather nice television set aside from this flaw.  Even if it costs a significant amount, I'm just wondering if I can get the part, if that is indeed the problem, and replace it to get a clear picture.  If it's model-specific, it may be a problem, but...  Anyway, I'd be happy to provide any additional information, since I'm sure I haven't given enough, and I hope you can help me.

ive looked through the troubleshooting guide and read the computer manual and it said to press a button that manually enables wifi the button i found that looked like it could be that from the manual is an antenna tower with radio waves coming out but that is only to toggle on and off the airplane mode. 

I have also tried to manually connect to the wifi by typing in the connection name and the password etc. 

still havent got a connection. I dont know what is wrong but I do know my computer wont even let me toggle on and off the wifi switch. its like grayed and faded out and wont let me click it. 

any help is appreciated guys. thanks.

I currently have 200/10mbps and I contacted my isp today since I generally got around 100-120mbps. So they checked my connection to the modem and they got around 192 Mbps. I had already tried to use different cables, factory reset, three different computers. So they asked me try to another modem (luckly I had one extra at home) and that didnt help. So person that was helping was kinda stump but asked me try to Windows in safe mode with Networking (He didnt think it would help since I have had the same problem on three different pc) but anyway I tried it and I got 190Mbps on speedtest (I did speedtest like 20 times before that in normal mode and never got over 120Mbps) anyway after that I got around 130-150Mbps (In normal mode after using safe mode) which I still wasnt that happy about so I downloaded ubuntu and did a speedcheck there and I got 180-190 Mbps in 15 tests. 

So I re installed the OS one of my computers and ever since then my internet speed is around 100-185 Mbps (I can do one test and get 100Mbps and the next test I get ~180 Mbps) 

So I really do not know what I should try next (Non of my computers use the same Motherboard/dedicated internet card and I have disabled windows firewall just in case that was the problem but no....) And I can transfer data between my computers at 100-110MBps.

So any suggestions on what I should try now?

(I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate 64 and the modem is a Netgear CG3100)

If needed I can post specs of my comps. But they all should be able to handle the speed.

I recently encountered an issue where I cannot get Netflix to work in any browser (Firefox, Chrome, even IE).  I can load the website, but as soon as I click ""play"" on the browse videos site, when it loads the Silverlight plug-in, nothing happens.  If I right click the screen at any time, an error message shows up saying that Silverlight has crashed.

My computer: Win7 Pro, AMD Quad core, 8 gigs of ram, Radeon HD 4850.

I have uninstalled and reinstalled Silverlight, and deleted the files from the AppData folder.  I have tried multiple browsers.  I have deleted cookies, temporary internet files, and cleaned up my registry using CCleaner.  I have tried to run Firefox in safe mode, disabling all add-ons.  I have attempted to run an earlier version of Silverlight (but Netflix insisted I upgrade, rendering that attempt useless).  I have also upgraded my video card drivers to the latest version.

I have also attempted to run Netflix through Windows Media Center, and it has resulted in the same black screen.  There is nothing wrong with the Netflix account, because it works on a different computer, as well as both my Android phone and tablet.

Any ideas on how to work through this issue?  I'm all out of troubleshooting ideas.

I'll copy my post from the forum:

""I'm not sure how to describe this problem, but I'll do my best. I have the HD PVR, with the intention of recording Game footage. The same issue has occurred with my SNES and my Genesis, so I don't think it's system specific. The problem is as follows:

I'm running the system with the A/V (Red/White/Yellow) into the front of the PVR. The PVR is plugged in, and connected to my PC via the included USB cable to a USB 2.0 port. The Component audio/video are running from the back of the PVR to my Dynex LCD Television. When I have the PVR on, and everything is on, things run just fine. Aspect ratio is correct, colors come through correctly, and the input is responsive. Once I run the TotalMedia program, AND select the PVR as the source (The problem doesn't occur when the source is my Webcam, for example), the video on the preview will lag behind and be slower, as expected, but on the TV, the video will periodically cut out and reset, as though the transmission of the signal is being switched on and off quickly. This will occur every 20-30 seconds. in addition, the Aspect ratio gets horizontally squashed; if the image is stretched to widescreen on my TV, it will change to 4:3 (or close to it), and if the TV is set to standard, it's normal when running normally, but it gets even more squashed when it resets, so that the aspect ratio is almost square. It will do this the first time, and then it will keep resetting the signal periodically, but the image won't change further. (Although one time it did move so that it wasn't centered in the screen, instead being way off to the side.) None of these changes reflect in the preview window, and the problem persists during capture, even if the preview is turned off.

Once the source is set to something else, or the program is exited entirely, the resetting of the signal stops, but the alteration of the aspect ratio persists. I don't know if this has something to do with the drivers, the capture software, or my TV, or whatever it may be. If anyone could offer any advice, it would be much appreciated. If there are any questions you'd like me to answer, let me know.

After trying a video capture test, the recording looks fine for a while, but then the audio jumps forward and gets desynced by a fair margin, and the video remains the same. I assume this is when the issue occurred. Could this have to do with the format of the video signal being less than 1080i? It's running 480i at the moment.""

if you made it through that wall of text, props, but the basic gist is this:  It works fine when I'm playing stuff through the PVR normally, but when I have it as an input device in the capture software, it suddenly starts doing this.  Maybe it's not designed to work for this, but it's supposed to be, and I don't see why if it works to output without going into the software, why it has the problem when it is.  Of course, since the capture is all off, maybe it's not limited to the output.  I'm baffled here, and think we may have bought the wrong box.  It's such a strange issue, since it works fine most of the time, save every 30 seconds or so.  as stated above, any help would be appreciated.

The Problem:

I recently installed the SSD and wiped the older HDDs.  I decided to dual-boot Windows and Linux with the SSD.  Everything installed correctly (although I had to fix the Linux boot to get the GRUB menu) and the boot times were ~20-30 seconds for W7 and about 15 for Ubuntu.  However after I installed Steam, Commodo and ATI's CCC drivers the Windows boot time is ~20 minutes (The last boot I timed was 20 minutes and 30 seconds).  I would really appreciate if someone could help me figure this problem out.  20 minutes is unacceptable for a HDD and is insane for a SSD.  Googleing has failed to turn anything up for me, I just found people complaining about ~2-3 minute boot time.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I'm running a dual monitor set-up as well, I don't know if this changes anything.

I concluded that it was due to low resources and excessive disk access so I increased the system memory and started to defragment the drive.

When I went to defragment the drive, I realized it only had 2GB free, which was not enough to properly defrag.  About 45 Gb of the drive is occupied by the iTunes music library, so I made a backup of the directory on a removeable drive, then deleted it from the local system, freeing up enough space to defrag.

After defragmenting the drive (using the windows native client), I went to restore the iTunes directory and noticed that the free space on the drive was now only 44Gb, which is too small to copy the directory back.

Since the directory fit on the drive previously with 2GB extra room, this implies that I have somehow 'lost' around 3 to 4 GB of usable space during the defragment process.

Steps I have taken to fix:

* 1.  Searched the drive for large temp and hidden files (found none new)
* 2.  Verified no shadowcopy
* 3.  Removed the 'exta' 1Gb allocated to paging file after adding 1Gb of memory
* 4.  Ran Auslogics defrag and optimization 
* 5.  Ran checkdisk

After all of this, I have managed to massage the free space up to 45 Gb, so there is still an extra 2Gb 'missing'.

Before I removed the dir from the disk originally, I verified that it was an exact copy (CRC checksum), and the file systems reported both copies as being the same size, so I know the directory itself did not grow.

I am going to suggest upgrading the drive to something larger as a long term solution, but I need to get it back to original condition for the short term.

Any ideas?

EDIT:  Never found definitive proof of what happened.  I wound up compressing everything in 'My Documents' (and lower), including the music files, and gained back 6GB of free space.  Having the documents compressed might be slower than typical, but it is still MUCH faster than it was.

I would really appreciate your help with these questions! Thanks! 

I bought a Packard Bell external hdd, which comes with software.
Now, my first question is: why do I even need software if I could just copy+paste everything from my windows7-computer to the external hdd?

Concerning the software, it is so simple but confusing at the same time: there are 2 main options: ""(start) auto-backup"", which doesn't do anything because in the log it just says that my computer-hdd is not available.
Since that didn't work I tried the other option: ""syncing"" So I configured that the external hdd would sync with my computer-hdd. For 5 hours it was doing something but in the end the external hdd wasn't filled, it even decreased in contents. 
It also seems that the updator option is also not working.

Then I still got a different kind of question: is it a good idea to unplug the external hdd after the backup was made, and put it away so it is safe in case my computer could get a software-error which could otherwise affect the connected external hdd also?

Thanks for the help!

(1) Toshiba Satellite L755

4.0 GB RAM
Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit OS (Quad Core) (SP1)

(2) Built Desktop
AMD FX-8350 Eight-Core 4.00 GHz
8.00 GB RAM
Windows 7 Ultimate (cracked) 64-bit OS (no updates)

I have been using AudioBox USB for a while now, in conjunction with my Studio One v2 software. My dynamic mic and guitar records just fine on either system. My issue began when I started using my new condenser mic.

The issue:
*When 48V is engaged on AudioBox USB, system (2), the Desktop, does not recognize the USB input. I can hear both guitar and mic with ""INPUT"" turned up on the AudioBox, but hear nothing with ""PLAYBACK"" turned up. Studio One v2 does not register any audio. 

*On system (1), the Laptop, I have yet to find an issue. Windows recognized the interface and I can record. 

**Attempted fixes: 
Updating the driver to the latest 64-bit. Attempted installing driver with 48V engaged but ended in failure. Only installed w/o 48V engaged and the earlier stated issue popped up even after updating.

The reason I would rather not utilize the laptop for Studio One is because of the resolution. I can not see everything I am using in Studio One on my laptop, so recording can become difficult. 

Is there a solution to make it work on my desktop?
Do I need to cave in and find the cheapest yet most compatible macbook for my recording needs? 

Thanks again for giving your time to read all of this and considering a possible solution! 
I have this uncanny feeling it is the fact that I have shied away from updating a cracked version of Windows.

I use Chrome, but other browsers don't work either.

Alright, so the first thing I noticed was yesterday, when all of a sudden, the youtube app on my android (4.1) tablet didn't work anymore - every video had a playback error. I tried my iPhone, didn't work there either. At first I was like ""eh"" and just forgot about it for a while. Later I tried on my computer, and it didn't even load the website at all. I thought it was weird, but chalked it up for normal internet hiccups and went to bed. Today, it's still not working. And I noticed that the Google Play Store on the tablet doesn't work (""No connection"") ... when I click on the ""Help"" button, the website it takes me to won't load. I tried googling this (regular Google.com works! My Gmail address works, too!) and I can not open any of the links that have anything to do with google. (like, support.google.com etc)
Every other website works and I don't notice any difference in my internet performance, so idk.
I tried logging out and back in, restarting every device and the router several times, resetting the router, clearing the cache, cookies, other data...
I'm pretty sure it's a wifi issue SOMEHOW because when I try to use Youtube on my phone via 3G, it works fine (I just don't usually do that because limited data plan and all that).

And now it seems like Facebook isn't working anymore either. The mobile site on my phone works, but it doesn't work on my computer. What.

I'm not completely stupid when it comes to computers, but I have NO idea what's causing this or where I could even start fixing it.
Let me know if you need any additional info.

I managed to connect to YouTube on my computer earlier, and I noticed that I was logged out for some reason. Everything worked, until I tried to log in, and now it's back to not loading at all.

Now I am 100% certain that the problem is NOT with the network, since every other device in my house works fine besides the Y580, the same at other places I've used it as well. Anywho, every half hour or so, the internet would drop to limited connection and/or say I still had internet access when really I did not. At first it was manageable, I would disable and then re-enable wifi, or right click my wireless icon and troubleshoot, and the problem would be solved for a while. But as time progressed, is got worse and worse, so I started trying to solve it. Eventually I updated the driver and the internet worked perfectly for about 1 day, and then retrogressed to even worse than before. So I did the windows ""refresh"" option (keep all personal documents but remove all programs and reinstall windows default files) hoping it would fix the problem, but it did not, even after re-updating the drivers. I've tried just about everything. Can anyone give me a hand here?

They have started to escalate and become more severe to the point where I am considering buying replacement parts for everything that could be wrong, just to ensure I get rid of it. 

The most severe issue is the A/V crash. At seemingly random times (While gaming, watching videos, surfing the web, sitting at the desktop) and I am at a loss as to what the source may be.

Other issues: 

* Whenever i have to force power down after the A/V goes out, the monitors don't wake up on reboot. It usually takes 4-7 power ons before the monitor will power on as well. 

* When the A/V does crash, the audio stays fine until I press a key or move the mouse. Then it starts to ""stutter"" on a very short loop.

* Occasionally when I am gaming, I have screen flickers of lines or a very brief white scree.

* When I boot my pc, the mouse doesn't power on, I have to unplug and plug it back in for the PC to acknowledge it is there. 

* I cleaned out my entire PC a few weeks ago, and when I put it back together and booted it, it wouldn't boot and the mobo gave me an error code pointing to the RAM. (I took one stick out and it booted, I later put that stick back in to test and it worked fine....)



***My PC*** 

* i7-2600k, default clock

* Sapphire HD 7970, default clock 

* Asrock Z77 Extreme 4 Mobo

* 8gb G.Skill sniper series ram, default clock

* 1 tb Samsung HDD

* 120 GB Mushkin Chronos Deluxe SSD

* Corsair Enthusiast 850w PSU

***My Consideration***

I am thinking of just replacing my CPU, RAM, PSU, &amp; MOBO, then doing a complete OS re-install just to hopefully clear out the program all together, but I really don't want to spend the money. 

I have already run FurMark, and monitored my CPU and GPU. Everything ran fine. Avg'd 85 fps at 720, with temps on GPU holding at 73, and CPU temps steady at 53. 

**EDIT**: I left out the GPU in replacements, because I have already replaced that (I used to have a 6770), and continue to have issues. So, I am skeptical that the GPU is the source.

I have this old multi-card-reader which usually connects to the motherboard, but on my new computer there's little room for it and its cable is too short to reach outside the case ( I don't care for esthetics in computers ). 

And now I've cut a common USB cable and have tried to match the wires with the card reader.  It's not working.

At first I connected only the matching colors: 

- reds, greens, whites, blacks.  I connected it and it powered up, but the system (XP) didn't react to it.

There were some colors left from the card reader, so I looked it up and found [this page](http://www.usbman.com/Guides/BelkinMotherboard_cable_assembly.htm), with the following setup:

|COLOR |CONNECT TO|
|:------|-------------|
| RED, ORANGE	| POWER, VCC, SVCC, +5V |
| WHITE, YELLOW |	P-, DATA-, SBD- |
| GREEN, GREY	| P+, DATA+, SBD+ |
| BLACK, BLUE, BROWN	| GROUND, GRND, GND |

- this one doesn't work at all, no power in the device (it has a LED). But I took a picture...


My current setup: http://i.imgur.com/zrI2oek.jpg (large resolution)

Of course, I isolated the wires before plugging it in.

Edit: I thought about including the configuration on the jack I cut off from the card reader. It's  4/5:

- red - white - green - grey - black^(thick isolation)

I was thinking a USB enclosure would be the cheapest/easiest solution...but with the different sizes/standards I have, it seems to be hard to find one that supports all my hard drives. Is there a better way? I am hoping to spend less than $30 on one device that can do this. Thank you!

ASUS desktop, Windows 7, USB wireless network adapter, linksys AE1000.   This setup has been working fine for 2+ years.

Avast shows no viruses, per suggestion from this forum I ran mbam and no problems detected either.  I do not see any new software installed on this computer in the past few months. She claims to have not opened any attachments. 

I uninstalled the usb wireless network adapter from device mgr, rebooted no luck. 

I bought a new Linksys USB adapter and tried that.  the install software (CD that came in the box) did not fully complete installation despite multiple tries which I found weird.   The new adapter did appear in the networking windows (of the control panel).  Same result when I click on the network icon, no networks found. I have 4 other computers successfully attached to my network wirelessly so I don't think it's a router problem. 

I thought it might be the hardware but after trying new I think I have ruled that out.

I haven't run a Windows computer in a number of years and am not familiar with Windows 7.  I went to start in safe mode, I held down f8 and a screen appeared asking which drive I wanted to start from, the hd or the attached usb backup drive.  I selected the internal hd and the pc seemed to start normally - not in what I remember safe mode to look like.  Does safe mode in Windows 7 look like what safe mode in xp looks like (rather primitive and really basic)? 

summary:  wireless networking on Win7 box stopped working
ran mbam &amp; avast, no bad stuff
started in safe mode, not sure I actually did start in safe mode, ran mbam, no bad stuff reported
replaced usb wireless network device with new, driver software did not fully install (just ran on and didn't complete) same 'no network found message.

I connected my removable HD (1.5Terrabyte) like normal which i've been using for about a year and started moving files over like normal to store my files but during moving i guess it locked up, a file which should have taken maybe 1-2 mins to move over was 'loading' for over 30 mins so i cancelled it but again it locked up during the ""cancelling""  bar so i had to ctrl-alt-del and close it that way, this caused windows to i guess crash and my Start bar was gone so i had to restart the computer.

Computer restarted like normal, came back into windows and the removable HD did that little 'ding' sound when connected but however the other Drive did not show.

When I go to computer management the second drive is not there but when i click the second slot it asks me to 'initialize' - will this format it if I do? I do not want to do this if that's the case because of all the old files that I have stored on that HD.

I have tried this removable on another computer and also with a different OS(Win7 and Winxp) and same issue.

I tried obviously turning it on/off and also different USB cable in fear that my current one got damaged.

Hey Guys, yeah just to clarify yes, I did get the refund from another system.

It did that about 10 times and now it just displays this BSoD after loading the windows screen for 10 secs or so, and doesn't move from this screen (I have to switch it off myself): http://i.imgur.com/GwnO9F1.jpg

There is physical damage to the laptop exterior where the power button is, the hinge and plastic casing is broken, but has been like that for months now. Sometimes it seems to short circuit or something- it suddenly switches off in the middle of use, as if power supply was disrupted. I used to be able to turn it back on fine, but not this time. Also about 2 weeks ago, some smoke came out of the site near the power button where the casing is damaged, but the laptop didn't switch off and the smoke stopped after a few seconds. No smoke since then. This is where the case is damaged and where the smoke came out of: http://i.imgur.com/Y4yk78H.jpg

Not sure if it is related to the fact that my computer now blue screens no matter how many times I try turn it on. 

It is an Acer Aspire, nearly 3 years old, running Windows 7.

Edit: booted from last known good configuration, got to windows screen and alas, it suddenly switched off again (no BSoD this time)

After reading all the posts, I think it's safe to say yes, it is bricked.

**Issues with Google Music, settings, etc.**

**If there is anything else you need, please let me know!**




I'm wanting to transfer everything that's currently on my 4GB MicroSDHC card to a 16GB MicroSDHC card, but I'd like to see if I can keep most of the settings/music playlists/etc. as they are now.  I have a few questions and concerns about this.

First of all (and my main concern), I use Google Music/Play Music on my phone and some via my laptop/browser.  I noticed a while back when I rebooted/formatted my laptop that when I logged onto Google Music that a couple of my playlists, and many songs were missing.  I do have all my music backed up (External HD and purchases over Amazon Cloud/Music), and the playlists and songs are still on my phone but do not show up under Google Music when I log on.  I have a very strong love-hate relationship with Google Music...

Is there any way to sync everything together to where BOTH my phone AND the browser version of Google Music have all of my music and playlists?  If not, what else can I do?  Will I have to just rebuild my playlists?

Second, as far as the pictures I have on my phone and my backgrounds, will these all transfer and keep their settings?  If not, is there a way I can keep it from changing?  Or should I just load everything over to the new one and re-arrange and setup my background?

Lastly, as far as other app settings and whatnot, will these all transfer?  I know I've changed a few to ""Move to Media Storage"" and whatnot, should I try moving these back as a precaution?  

Is there anything else I should know/do to keep everything as close to the same as possible?  What would be the exact steps in doing everything?

Thanks again for all of your help!  You guys rock!

Hello,

First of all I would like to thank all of you for you help, especially /u/Abnix for going out of his way to help me by talking to me on Teamspeak and guide me through troubleshooting the problem.

The PSU wasn't the thing that was smoking, it's completely fine and works on my other computer, the brown smudge on the capacitors are from quality testing. The RAM, Hard Drive and Video card are all fine too.

It seems that I was a fool for buying an ASRock 970 Extreme3 motherboard. Newegg reviews are full of people that have had problems with it.

I managed to get a refund on the motherboard and a RMA on the processor just incase.

To all of you buying parts out there. Be sure to be very through on checking the reviews on parts you're buying. Go as far to search the part name on this subreddit and use metareddit.com to see when it's been mentioned in the comments.

I need help finding a reliable AM3+ motherboard. I would love if it were as cheap as the ASRock 970 but the priority here is reliability. Of course we're avoiding any ASRock motherboards. I would also appreciate if you guys could tell me reliable brands for everything hardware related so I never buy something bad again.

Also, how's the upgrade path going from a AM3+ motherboard? Could I get a 7790 in the future which is a PCI Express 3.0 card?

I was playing games last night when all of a sudden my display goes dark and my sound cuts out.  My tower remained on - lights, fans, and I believe my mouse/keyboard as well.  I attempted to restart first using the reset button, which has no effect, then holding the power button down, also with no effect.  I had to turn off the power supply to get the thing to shut off.

Turning the system back on, I get lights/fans/CPU, but I hear no post beep and my display is still dark.  Keyboard/mouse won't turn on.  The hard drive seems to be spinning fine, but I've noticed my GPU is not on - at least, the fan isn't running on it.

This initially led me to believe the GPU was busted - since the display cut out in the first place and it won't turn on - but since I get no post and the peripherals won't turn on either, I worry it's a problem with the motherboard.

I'm going to try to procure some spare parts to switch in but that's going to take some time.  Any thoughts?

I'm left scratching my head at this. I was using a surge protector and there wasn't any sort of power spike/failure or indicator that would point to problems with the card except one incident of a 2 pixel wide artifact that came and went in a flash.

It's traveled from my house, to college, and to other friends houses almost every day in my backpack; nothing has broken/cracked/frayed or anything and no issues as of yet, until now. About 10 minutes about I started getting this weird popping sensation in my headphones (mind you I haven't worn them in a couple of hours since I got home, so I don't know if this happened right when I got back.) Basically, anything I turn up the bass to a certain point, the audio cuts/pops as if someone cranked a compressor on each bass hit. To add to that, I notices the power light on the volume slider slightly flicker every time a loud bass hits.
I figured it might've been the outlet I was using with my AC-to-USB adapter (to avoid feedback from my games and talking buddies over Mumble.) So I tried a different port, no dice. Tried my phone adapter (both the original and my phone adapter are 5.0v adapters.) Same result. Although Upon plugging it into my desktops back USB slot, the popping stopped; I could crank the back and sound as loud as I wanted without so much as a hiccup.
Either I'm JUST noticing this now or something has happened with my headset. Regardless, I want to hear if anybody has an reccomendations on the matter. I usually never crank the Bass Boost wheel all the way, maybe just one revolution from the starting point, as I find the max boost to be too much.
TL;DR: X12 headphones pop when loud bass is hit when using a 5.0v AC-to-USB adapter, but doesn't pop when plugged into the motherboard's USB. Thoughts?

This is my router - http://www.netgear.com/home/products/wirelessrouters/ultimate-performance/wndr4500.aspx
Motherboard - ASRock z77 extreme3 w/ Gigabit LAN (not wireless)

My computer does not include a wireless card, if this changes anything.

I went through the process of setting up the Powerline, I plugged one into the wall by my router and connected the Ethernet cable to the router. I plugged the other by my computer (across the house, same floor) and connected the Ethernet to that one, too. I securely connected the two devices using WPS and in the control panel for my router and Powerline devices they show they are connected and sending/receiving signals.

The odd part is that my computer, despite being connected to an adapter receiving signals, does not want to find my network. When I troubleshoot the issue it pops up with ""Windows did not detect wireless network adapter. Please re-install the drivers or adapter"" something along those lines.

On my computer I also have the control panel for the Powerline devices but nothing shows up there where something shows up on the computer I am posting from now. The router control panel is useless because it requires a connection to the router.

I also tried setting up a guest network that does not require a password to see if security was preventing my computer from noticing the network. Nope, didn't work.

What I know is that running a VPN is probably the best way to accomplish this. I also know I will need to setup DDNS at each place because the houses have dynamic IPs. I also looked that the specs of the NAS and it supports rsync which will sync the files from one of those to another.

What I dont know is what kind of router to buy that supports all of these.

I have looked at [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833320091) and it seems like it will do the job. Is there anything cheaper, and even better than this that I am unaware about?

Also I have never set up a VPN, DDNS, or rsync before so any insight would be appreciated.

There is a huge drop in power utilization that coincides with a drop in GPU utilization. It looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/0lVZKch.png). It occurs in any app, that particular one is Far Cry 3 which creates the most issue.

System:

* Intel Core i7 3820 @ 4.3 Ghz
* Corsair H110
* 16 gigs of that awesome low profile low voltage samsung ram
* Gigabyte Windforce 2GB 670 OC
* Gigabyte X79-UP4
* Seasonic 850X PSU (850 Watts)

Temps are in the range of 50-60c when playing a game they only reach 70c when running furmark burn in.

What I've done:

The first thing I did was I reverted the force-enable-gen3.exe hack from nVidia. After reading their descriptions of the issues with PCI Express 3.0 and X79 chipsets it sounded like it could be the same issue. So it is running PCI Express 2.0 as expected and as specced. It seemed to possibly help, but did not eliminate the problem and could have been placebo effect.

After performing some research reading that the issue could possibly be with GPU boost aggressively managing the clock, I started by increasing the power target and vcore using MSI afterburner. After that did not work I attempted to use the ""force constant voltage"" option and gave it a modest overclock reading that this had solved the issue for at least 1 user (50mhz core 50mhz memory). 

After that did not work -Starting with the 314.14 drivers. I downgraded back to 314.07. I flashed the newest BIOS onto the card, I flashed it back to what came with the card. I flashed the newest BIOS again. Uninstalled Ultramon (just in case it was interfering with video drivers). 

I have the newest BIOS for my motherboard. I've also tried it both open and closed case just in case the VRM was overheating. I also applied a stress test of 1024x768 Furmark AND Prime95 Blend to attempt to push as hard as I could to see if the CPU's voltage was being throttled down as you would expect with an overheating VRM. This was not the case, both it and the card stayed at their constant respective voltages (1.175 for the card 1.284 for the CPU). 

[This](http://i.imgur.com/G9ZXksr.png) is another screenshot from Far Cry 3 to demonstrate that the issue load independent. After the red line I stood and looked straight down at the ground and stayed that way until the end of the monitoring session. [Here](http://depositfiles.com/files/s2oflpjzg) is an afterburner hardware log from the same session.

This issue exists in all games, Far Cry 3 is just the best one to demonstrate via hardware logging.

As far as I can tell the only things I haven't done is put my actual hands on the hardware itself. What should my next steps be and does anyone have any suggestions? Thank you for your time, I hope I was comprehensive enough in my supplied data.

Edit: Edited to add this screenshot that implies a possibly cyclical nature to the problem. It was after complete reinstall of 314.07 drivers using driver sweeper in between. My next step is to try an older driver in the 310 range to see if it creates the issue. Though I am worried that losing FC 3 updates from newer optimizations could mess with the results. 

Additionally I have determined that the large spikes are occuring 45 seconds apart, I have drawn a red line between two such spikes and have determined that all of them are 45 seconds apart. Including the second half of the benchmark where I got on a hang glider and just glided over the landscape to further demonstrate that actions don't matter. While there are other intermittent drops between them 45 seconds is far too much from the worse drops even when the action changes there are still large framerate drops at 45s.

The vertical red line in this picture is when I boarded the hang glider and performed no other actions and just let it coast until it hit the ground. This is on the very high pre-set by the way.

**Thanks to you guys I have pretty well narrowed it down to PSU, Mobo, or GPU. I have my suspcions it's the mobo. I have decided that before I tear apart my system to put in a new PSU I am going to wait because around 3/22 or so I will have hands on access to another GTX670. It's a powerful enough tool and has enough potential to narrow it down that I think it's worth the wait. In the mean time I sent a ticket to Gigabyte tech support to see if it is a known issue. I will update with a new post around 3/22 or so with the results of that testing. Thanks again and I'm tagging ""don't even care anymore"" because there's no ""I'm waiting to work smarter, not harder"" option.**

I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit but my question does apply.

I've been using a TV as my computer monitor for years. (LG LCD 47'').
Recently, I noticed that while I'm playing a game, the TV sometimes makes a high pitched noise, like a cricket or a chirping noise. I only hear it while I'm actually playing a game. If I pause it and browse the option menu, it stops. Similarly, it's louder or fainter depending on what I'm ''looking at'' in the game. I didn't notice a distinct pattern.

I googled this but I only found situations where the TV wasn't working anymore. Mine is working perfectly fine, except for the noise.

Thanks for the help, let me know what else I can find out.

This seems like something that was relevant a year ago at least, but I decided to try my hand at gaming. And, really, this is the only one I want to play.

But I can't. The game freezes during gameplay, sometimes to the point of unplayability:

-The entire game lags - audio, video and game. This happens in two specific instances: when changing weapons and when interacting with some character or object [firing, getting hit, interacting with objects and scenery]. This would make the entire game skip for as long as it takes to move the mouse or press a key, then the skipping stops [I can induce the lag by changing weapons very quickly].

-Multiplayer does not lag differently than offline.

-All video and graphics settings are at their lowest. If they were any lower I might as well be playing Goldeneye 64.

I submitted a ticket to Steam Help and posted on the forums. Only the latter gave me any sort of response, but it did not work.

I've done everything except for reinstalling Windows and/or wiping and starting fresh [is that even necessary?]. I even went out and bought some compressed air, and taught myself how to open up my laptop and clean the dust. It was fun, but it did not help even marginally. All drivers are up to date, this machine is half-empty, etc.

Games that I have tried that work on this computer:  
DotA 2  
Torchlight  
tactlessly pirated Starcraft 2 - the game did not work properly but the graphics did!  
Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 [I did not test if it worked online/multiplayer, borrowed the disk for about 5 minutes].  
Frozen Synapse and Shadowgrounds from one of the Humble Bundles  

Portal does not play. Everyone I've asked says it has something to do with the HL2 source engine, but there is no information on this.

specs

Windows 7  
AMD Athlon II P320 @ 2100 Mhz  
ATI Radeon HD 4200  
4GB RAM  
(Sony Vaio VPCEE23FX)

Yes, these are sufficient to play the game. I was playing the game not even more than a year and a half ago.

At this point I guess it's not even about the game anymore.. I just want to solve this problem.

I have yet to try the setup on the Outlook 2007 computer.

When setting up the account, there was already an existing Gmail account set up on the Outlook 2010 computer. I went for the regular setup, and after setting up, I tried to define my own gmail account database (PST file) as the default one, but it wouldn't allow me to do it. Other than this there was no problem with the set up, only thing is I want to delete the existing account's database and can't do it when its database is set as default.

Reading some troubleshooting online, I noticed that you cannot use an IMAP account as a default account on Outlook. So I went into Gmail and turned IMAP off, turned POP3 on and set up the account, again, this time (apparently) as a POP3 account.

*Problem?* Every time I sent an email from Gmail (webbased), I received it as incoming mail on Outlook. Huh.

This was the point when I gave up. I don't mind setting up two different email accounts for each computer (I don't need an identical email address on them), but I want my account to be the only one on that computer. I also don't need it to be gmail specifically, it can be yahoo, windowslive or anything of the sort.

Any assistance would be much appreciated!

**ETA a very important detail** - I need to have the option to use the webbased version, as I need to have access through my phone and when I'm not at work, so the idea of having every outgoing mail sent as incoming is problematic.

1360531378.0,6,self.24hoursupport,189lf4,PC is failing to post after replacing both the mobo and CPU and I have no idea what to do. :(,TheThirdRider,7,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/24hoursupport/comments/189lf4/pc_is_failing_to_post_after_replacing_both_the/,"I had a problem a few months ago where my PC would turn on, everything would light up and the fans would all go, but there would be no cursor on the screen and all that would happen would be the CD drive would rev over and over. 

I tried doing a benchtop trouble shoot, removing everything slowly and waiting for beep codes, and I finally got down to the motherboard and the CPU and still no beep code. From what I read this indicates it's likely a mobo problem since they said CPUs rarely go bad. 

I since replaced the motherboard with the same model and tested again and I got the same problem. I bought the same CPU and tried that; still the same problem. I tried a new, higher power 950W power supply and still nothing. I used the monitor on another computer and it worked, so I know it's not something that stupid.

I'm a poor college student and I could really use a working PC at home. I don't want to buy a new one if I could fix mine for a little bit, but I'm stumped and I don't know what more to do. I don't have much experience and was mostly following tutorials and videos online, so now I'm pretty much at a dead end. Can anyone offer any suggestions I can try? I'd be incredibly grateful for any help that anyone can offer.
