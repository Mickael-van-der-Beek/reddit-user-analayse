1365520277.0,475,self.ADHD,1bzqyc,According to Lumosity I am a very special snowflake when it comes to memorization...,tornadofox,599,124,266,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1bzqyc/according_to_lumosity_i_am_a_very_special/,"As in the bottom 2%.  I know that making you feel like an idiot is part of their business model and I don't put too much stock into these train your brain websites.  But when it comes to clicking those damn red squares my mind just turns into a gaping void.   Its like there is nothing there.  I know I'm not a moron but I admit that I find my daily short-term memory to be embarrassingly inadequate.  Loosing things, blanking on names and dates after only a minute of hearing them, going into a room and then wondering why.   Meds only mildly help.   I guess what I'm saying is while I can laugh off my abysmal Luminosity failures as being a stupid game, there are real world repercussions and deficiencies that seem to get in my way.

The funny thing is, I'm a visual artist and can draw thousands of things from memory with considerable accuracy.  For example, if I draw a motorcycle once- I'll have no problem remembering the exact placement  and functions of the mechanical elements if I want to draw it a second time.  Just don't ask me what the pieces are called.  Life drawing has always been a breeze its like my brain just automatically understands the visual rhythms of the human body and knows where all of the muscles go.  Ask me to name a certain piece of anatomy, and I'll laugh in your face.  But I can sketch it out and be like: ""that thingy.""  

Not trying to bolster my fractured ego here, but does anyone else experience this frustrating mix of being able to effortlessly memorize certain things but when it comes to basic recall fall flat?

Any way to improve working memory in a way that is actually relevant to daily life?  (As in not clicking on red squares)

Could this be a ""learning type"" issue?  Kinesthetic vs visual?  

Or maybe an issue of how much I actually care about certain things?  (Don't care about red squares, but I care about motorcycles.)

For people new to reddit (and a reminder to everyone else) be sure to upvote questions you want answered so the best ones rise to the top!

EDIT: **Wow great job on upvotes both in the comments and post! Comments rarely get above 20 upvotes here. Keep it up in other threads! Thanks again everyone!**

***

Ari has generously accepted my offer to be the guinea pig for the 1st **/r/ADHD expert AMA**. /r/ADHD is a great place to find tips/information from others with ADHD and now it is a place to interact with ADHD experts as well!

Ari is the author of:

* One of my favorite ADHD books **[More Attention Less Deficit](http://www.amazon.com/More-Attention-Less-Deficit-Strategies/dp/1886941742)** (has perforated corners and &lt;1 page on each topic). 
* **[Understand Your Brain, Get More Done: The ADHD Executive Functions Workbook](http://www.amazon.com/Understand-Your-Brain-More-Done/dp/1886941394)** - A workbook which offers thought-provoking questions to guide you through your life much like an ADHD coach would.
* **[Integrative Treatment for Adult ADHD: A Practical, Easy-To-Use Guide for Clinicians](http://www.amazon.com/Integrative-Treatment-Adult-ADHD-Easy-/dp/1572245212)** - An easy to use guide for clinicians for diagnosing and treating ADHD.

He has been active in the ADHD community for the past 13 years as a **clinical psychlogist, ADHD support group facilitator, speaker, and author.**

####Ari has started to answer questions under the username TuckmanPsych. His posts have a big brain next to them if you enabled /r/ADHD CSS.

***

What topics does Ari know about?

* ADHD and Relationships 
* anxiety, depression and other co-occuring disorders 
* ADHD coaching
* ADHD diagnosis + treatment + therapy
* Basically anything related to ADHD. 

***

I recommend listening to his podcasts (most under 10 minutes!) and reading his blog at [adultadhdbook.com](http://www.adultadhdbook.com). 

###### Listen to the webinar I did with Ari on the topic [A Stronger Mindset to Overcome Life's Challenges](http://www.addresources.org/files/ari-tuckman-webinar-a-stronger-mindset-to-overcome-lifes-challenges.mp3) (52 mins). You can get a sense for his clear style filled with lots of examples. 

*Note: This was my first webinar so I didn't record the first couple minutes the audio starts mid-sentence. 

##### Thank you /r/ADHD and Ari for making this AMA a success (in advance)!
***
*I plan to bring hopefully monthly AMA's to the /r/ADHD community using connections I have made myself and through my non-profit ADD work/volunteering. Let me know who you want to ask a question!*

 Last night I read /u/TheBananaKing description of ADHD in /r/bestof. When I was finished I was so pissed I slammed my laptop closed, paced the house for ten minutes, talked out loud to myself and went to bed.

NEVER IN MY LIFE has anyone been in my head like that not a shrink or doctor, sympathetic friend or family member. No one. The only thing I'd change is that I don't wonder how the doorknob works, I know. I HAD to take the fucker apart and find out. 

I was diagnosed with ADD before most anyone knew it existed. I was 9, that was 23 years ago. Over the years I've been through countless meds and cognitive exercise plans to improve my abilities with minimal to maximum improvement.

 Eight years ago I got married to the woman of my dreams and I discovered to my horror that ADD and ADHD were myths, that they were silly excuses to put problem children on medication. Her parents had ""tricked"" her into seeing a psychologist about the possibilities of her having it so it was all and evil scam. I wasn't allowed to take meds she didn't believe in it. She mocked my coping mechanisms and told me I used ADD as an excuse not to pull my weight. 

And I believed her. 

I started thinking I was inadequate,that I was a normal guy, just sub-par and that this was as good as my life is gonna get. She was always frustrated with me and wondered why I couldn't do things quicker, more efficiently, more... like her. She believed my struggle was a ruse to manipulate and control her, make her pay the bills, clean the house, make phone calls, plan meals and events, manage our household. She always asked me why I couldn't be more helpful more normal. Compared to what? This is my normal, maximum effort minimal result. 

In 2011 she divorced me for being ""emotionally abusive"" my world collapsed, over the years she had taken away all my coping mechanisms which finally included herself. 

After reading that post and getting slapped with the biggest reality check ever *I had lost my marriage/life to ADD* all the subsequent comments with other people sharing their behaviors and coping mechanisms continued to punch me in the face. THIS IS REAL. (I had forgotten)

You will always find people that sympathize with you they say oh yah sometimes it's hard for me to focus too. Others who share side effects of medications with you or a funny story about their random thought process that started with a Beagle and ended up in a yo-yo factory.

But I have NEVER had someone get in the drivers seat of my brain and so perfectly describe what it's like to be me. I have never felt so validated in my life.

Last year my brother in IT showed me Reddit to find motivational stuff and distractions from the depression of losing my wife. I said to him ""you realize you just threw me down a rabbit hole I will probably never escape from"" I never imagined it would literally change my life. Yesterday I found motivation, I have an appointment in the morning with my doctor. Yesterday I found an ENTIRE community of support and legitimate understanding. Yesterday I found hope.

**Tips for dealing with Hyperactivity**

_________

For a lot of people with ADHD, hyperactivity isn't so much of a problem. Especially among adult ADHD. Still, there are those of us who still struggle with it. Here are some tips:

* When you are in one of those situations where you have to sit still and you feel physically like you can't still any longer, try curling your toes into your shoes and pushing. Hard. This tension can give you a sort of energy release. Also, try pushing the pads of your fingers together, as it has a similar effect.

* Keep a small lump of no-dry clay, [Finger Fidgets](http://www.therapyshoppe.com/category/P366-fidgeting-finger-springs-10-pk), [Ultimate Wire Fidgeters](http://www.therapyshoppe.com/category/1052-fidget-toys-classroom-fidgets), or really anything that works for you with you at all times. Fidgeting has been proven to help with all forms of ADHD (both Attention and Hyperactivity) as it keeps your brain awake and lets you spend less time worrying about what your body parts are doing (happens to me all the time with my hyperactivity) and more time focusing. [Here is an article on the benefits of exercising.](http://phys.org/news162554898.html)

* Make sure to do some form of exercising every single day, but differ the exercises. If you want to feel more relaxed during the day, work out in the mornings, right after you wake up. This will get some of your excess energy out before work/school as well as provide stimulation. You can also work out before bed and this may make it easier for you to sleep at night. [Here is an article on the benefits of exercise for ADHD](http://www.everydayhealth.com/health-report/adult-adhd/treatment.aspx)

Supposedly exercise brings ADHD's faulty receptors up to the normal levels for around two hours after the workout.

If you are in a work atmosphere where this is an opportunity, get up ever 15 minutes and walk around a little bit. Grab a drink, eat a snack, step outside for some fresh air. This is especially easy if you work at home. If you work in a cubicle, even just standing for a minute and stretching can help.

**Tips for dealing with Impulsivity**

__________

The main symptoms of Impulsivity are doing things without thinking, or saying things without thinking. Well, here is how you can improve:

* Before you act, take a minute to analyze the situation. I know how hard this is guys, but before any decision making take a moment to think. Make this a conscious effort. It will take practice, but eventually you will develop the skills to stop and think before acting.

Before you just blurt something out, consciously consider what the person you are talking to is saying. Are they still talking? Then don't interrupt. Is what you are planning to say at all related to what the other person was just saying? Then don't say it. Again, this is a conscious effort, and you will not gain results unless you work hard at it. It will be a pain, but you will see results. Think of conversations as time to practice. When you are chatting with your parents or friends, think about everything you even consider saying. Trust me, practice makes perfect.

**Inattentiveness**

_________

As one of the biggest issues related to ADHD, Inattentiveness is a huge issue. Here are some hopefully helpful tips:

*Memory:* 

Memory is a huge part of inattentiveness, as well as something that pisses the hell out of us. Try these tips:

* Loose objects like keys, phones, wallet, etc... are commonly lost by us ADHDers. How to stop losing these essential objects you ask? Bowls. That is it. Bowls. Keep a bowl right inside the door of your house to toss you keys and wallet into. Put a bowl in your room/kitchen/living room and be sure to put your phone into the bowl of whatever room you are in. Keep a bowl in your office and put all of your stuff into the bowl when you get there.

* Do a quick mental checklist before leaving any location. ""Wallet, keys, phone.  Check, check, check.  Good to go.""

* Notebooks. Notebooks are my everything. Actually, correction, notebook. Only one notebook. You do not want to lose this thing, and it is best to have everything in one place. Put in to-do lists, schedules, reminders, future events... Your notebook is your best friend. Write everything down. Everything. If you need to remember something write it in the notebook.

* Reminders.  On most phones there is a reminder system (or at least on IPhones and SmartPhones).  I set reminders to myself to do almost everything.  I duplicate my notebook to-do list on my phone just in case I lose my notebook.  Also, I set hourly reminders to go off alerting me to check my notebook and make sure I'm not dong something instead of my scheduled thing.

* Sticky notes. Sticky notes are great reminders. Put a sticky note on your front door saying :

                      Do you have your:

                      Wallet

                      Phone

                      Car keys

                      etc...

Put the same thing on the door to your office/workplace to make sure you remember it all. Basically, sticky notes should be everywhere as a trigger to remember something.

*Motivation*

I'm not gonna lie to you, I really wanted to make this guide, but it was a good three days after I came up with the idea before I put butt in chair and got started. I have this stint where if it isn't due tomorrow, I probably won't do it. It is time to fix that.

Come up with a reward system. For example, ""If I finish this guide I can reddit for 20 minutes."" It is a short term goal that will give you immediate satisfaction as soon as you have done it.

Schedule a specific time to do it. Are you gonna do it if it is just sitting on your to-do list? Hell no. If you have a specific set time, like 6:00 for example, then you will (hopefully) do it at 6:00.

Feel free to check out /r/motivation for quotes and such for you to get off your butt and do what you've gotta do.

*Inattentiveness*

* Go into a dark room and eliminate all sources of light. Take a flashlight in with you, sit down, and turn on the flashlight. Turn the beam and shine it onto the ceiling, rapidly moving it around. try to keep your eyes on the beam. In the dark room there is nothing to look at, so you will automatically want to focus on the light. It is a good brain training exercise.

* Try to work in 20 minute intervals. I have found this incredibly beneficial, as 20 minutes is pretty much my attention span. I take the items from my to-do list and divide my day into the 20 minute intervals. Literally my entire day in 20 minute intervals. Something like this:

^ 9:00-9:20 = Math homework

^ 9:20-9:40 = organize file cabinet

^ 9:40-10:00 = break

^ 10:00-10:20 = History homework

^ 10:20-10:40 = Math Homework

^ 10:40-11:00 = Organize file cabinet

^ 11:00-11:20 = Break

^ 11:20-11:40 = English homework.

If I finish something during that time slot then I can open up all of the time slots I had scheduled for it later on to do what I want. If I don't finish something in the number of slots I had set up for it, then I change things around or fill in one of my free time slots. It is really effective and I love this method! I am thirty times as productive as I used to be before this method!

________

**Sleep**

__________

*Sleeping starts with waking up*

I know the feeling. Your alarm bell rings at 7 o'clock, you fell asleep at 5, surely you deserve another few precious hours of sleep? Well, NO. If you decide to sleep in (and as a lazy college student that's a really easy decision to make) you won't be able to fall asleep the following evening. If I wake up tired, that means I have a slightly better chance of falling asleep without a struggle the following night.

Also, set multiple alarms in the morning in order to wake up.  I personally set three, and all of them are placed far away from my bed, with loud and obnoxious tones.  I have to get up to turn them off!

*Food*

Make sure you eat enough during the day.  Eat well during the day to ease the comedown of your meds in the evening and to give you the energy to make it through the day.

Try to eat a lot of fruit and veggies. Even though vitamin C makes your urine acidic and causes meds like dexamphetamine and adderall to be flushed out of your system quicker, make sure to eat your greens. In the evening drinking a lot of juice could possibly even make you sleep better because it gets your meds out of your system. No scientific source for that one though...

Don't drink caffeine, ever. It stays in your blood for way longer than you think (half life is 5 hours, so after 8 hours it's still in your blood!) and causes problems when you try to fall asleep. Tea also contains caffeine! Try and drink herbal tea instead.

Don't eat a lot of sugary goodness after dinner either, when you have munchies: eat cheese or something.

*Exercise*

Make yourself tired.  Especially when you do a desk job or anything else that requires you to be inside a lot, getting outside to exercise is great. Going to the gym exposes you to a lot of lights and loud music, not so great for winding down after a long day. Take a walk outside instead.

*Lights*

Like I said above, try to go outside in the evening. Your body makes melatonin in response to ambient light, walking/running/cycling/sitting in an environment that gradually gets darker gets your body prepared for sleep.

Switch your tv and computer off 2 hours before bedtime, read a boring (!!) book, paint something or talk with your roommates instead. Dim all the lights in the house, if you have to use your computer install f.lux and dim the screen.

If you don't mind looking dorky, /u/eawsound [1] recommends orange glasses that block blue light, wear them in the evening.

*Going to bed*

Go to bed when you are tired. Make sure your bedroom is full of fresh air, no tv's or other screens allowed. Switch your phone to airplane mode, set your alarm and don't browse Reddit or Facebook. Do a relaxation exercise. Don't get mad at yourself for not falling asleep! If you are unable to fall asleep after 30 minutes, get up and read a book in a really uncomfortable chair until you get sleepy again.

If you are sleepy and can't fall asleep (like I have all the time) don't get mad or frustrated. You are lying in bed, it's nice and warm and comfy there. Think about whatever you are thinking of. No sweat. When you get mad at yourself it will only get harder to fall asleep. Just lying there is really nice, just like snoozing is in the morning. When you get frustrated, get up and read a book or something. I love painting, so I get out of my bed and paint.

It's important to keep your bedroom for sleeping and having sex only. Don't watch tv, browse on your laptop or tablet or even read a book there. When you associate your bed with sleep, it will be easier to fall asleep there.

________

**Medication**

_________

* Take a 2-5 day break from your meds every few weeks. If you can find a short span of days where you know you won't need to be on medication, take a break. This can help if you're noticing a tolerance being built, and you'll be able to see just how much of a difference it makes. 

* Take your medicine with or after eating breakfast, as you will still have your appetite.  Eat a massive breakfast in order to compensate for the lack of lunch you will be eating later once your meds kick in. 

* Eat dinner after your medication has worn off, to keep your appetite up.

* Don't eat or drink citrus as it makes your meds wear off sooner.

* **CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU ARE HAVING WEIRD SIDE EFFECTS.  They are the experts, not us.**

___________

**DIET**

__________

SUPER UBER DUBER IMPORTANT.  Way more important than most people give it credit for.

* Minimize sugar and carbohydrates.  They increase hyperactivity and inattentiveness, and are just generally bad for you.

* Eat lots of protein and start taking Omega-3s.  They have shown to improve focus.  Plus, hey they're good for you!

* As always, try to eat vegetables, grains, fruits, and meat with every meal.  Except breakfast.  If you don't wanna then don't eat veggies with breakfast ;)

__________

**Other Tips**

__________

* Learn to meditate.  There are lots of different ways, and it's up to you to figure out what works best for you.  However, meditation has been proven to enhance focus and relieve anxiety and stress.  If you want more information I can provide links in comments if requested.

* Talk to psychiatrist and/or get an ADHD Coach.  ADHD coaches and psychiatrists can help you through the tough times and get your life together.

* Take a day to write out all of your symptoms, and then come up with a solution to minimize them.  Getting it all out on paper can really help you come up with solutions.

* Try to keep your environment clean.  Nothing exacerbates ADHD like a messy environment.  Which is ironic because it is very hard for ADHDers to *get* organized...

* Don't tell your workplace about your condition unless you absolutely need to!

* When doin chores it is much easier to turn on a  movie or call a friend than to do it in silence and hatred!

- Go on walks with your SO when you need to discuss something.

- If you have chores to do when you get home don't sit down. Once you sit down it is game over.

- Again with chores, find tasks that will make your walk around your house/apartment. For example, clean the top third of every room.

- Don't feel guilty about working on things you enjoy first. The motivation of completing one task will make the mundane ones easier.

- Stay busy and try to figure out something healthy and productive that stimulants your mind.

- Consider a standing desk. It's much easier for someone with ADHD to concentrate while standing rather than sitting.

Hope some of these are helpful for you. I highly recommend seeking out an ADHD coach; it's going to be expensive but I think it's going to be immensely helpful to work with someone who specializes with ADHD mind.

You see me playing games or browsing the internet and you think 'Must be nice.' You see me as that lazy slacker that never does his work and spends all the time jerking around. You wish you had it that easy because you have to sit and work hard like a normal person. Well, I got a news flash for you - you couldn't survive one week of being me.

Do you ever have to do something boring? Maybe you don't like it but it's pretty mindless and easy. You get it done because that's your job. What if I told you, you can't do it? You're supposed to get this boring work done real quick, but it just isn't happening. You sit down and you stare and nothing comes to mind, or maybe everything comes to mind. You start to get frustrated. You need to get this work done, it's important and you have to do it. Hours have gone by, and you still haven't done it. A chair squeaks, and you start thinking about chairs, chair pranks, and then you remember that one funny chair prank video so you pull it up on youtube and 30 seconds in you realize you were supposed to work so you close the video. Maybe it wasn't 30 seconds, maybe you got lost in distractions again and it was 30 minutes.

Deadline's coming up. You start to get desperate. You plead with yourself, try to make bargains. ""Please, please do this work, I'll let you play a video game for every 10 minutes of work you do."" Maybe it works a little, and a little is better than nothing. Now you've spent the whole day playing games, browsing the internet, getting distracted. Maybe you've worked for an hour, at best. Deadline's almost here. Maybe you get a burst of frenzied frustrated motivation borne out of pure suffering. Maybe you just don't get it done. Either way, it's half-assed. You know what your superiors are thinking. ""You worked on this for eight hours, and this is all you have to show for it?"".

You don't know what it's like. You can't comprehend what it's like when a basic part of your functionality doesn't work right. It's like not being able to breathe correctly, only it's not like that, because it's in your head, it's you, it comes from the inside, not somewhere else. But you think I am just lazy, that I have it easy, that I don't care.

Every day, from waking up in the morning, to going to bed at night, is a struggle. It's a constant, wearying fight. Some days you win, some days you lose. You've got pills to help you. Some days they work pretty well. Some days you might as well have thrown them in the trash. 

It is a fight, but I am strong. I have borne all the troubles and problems. I have dealt with the depression and sadness, crippling anxiety, and doubt. And I still stand, and hold my banner high, ready for the next fight tomorrow. I'm going to give it all I got, no matter what. So don't pity me, I don't need sympathy. Treasure your life, and make the most of it.

Earlier today I posted a satirical post applying the general public's perception of an alleged overdiagnosis of ADHD to Parkinson's disease for comedic effect. It's been as of now deleted.

Although I had no intention of offending people who have fallen ill to the devastating disease that is Parkinson's or have lost loved ones in this manner, I undoubtedly have done so, and should have anticipated that such a joke would not be taken in a positive light. As someone who has not met a grandfather and lost two dear aunts to cancer, I can understand how disease is not something to be taken lightly and should have known better.

For those reasons, I apologize, and wish you all an excellent week.

* I hate feeling terrified each time a teacher assigns a project, because I know that means several nights of very little sleep, attempting (and failing) to get a head start on said project, culminating in a night with no sleep as I feverishly try to focus and finish the assignment a few hours before it's due. 


* I hate when people see me lose focus and drift off somewhere, and then ask me what I'm thinking about; it's easier to just reply ""oh, nothing,"" than to try to explain the lightning-fast sequence of thoughts that led from, say, Genghis Khan, to a sociological analysis of push-up bras in under a minute. 


* I hate having to plan every waking moment, lest I get distracted and fuck up something important. 


* I hate panicking at the thought of not being able to fill my prescription on time, not because I'm addicted to it, but because I know that going off it for a few days means a steep, rapid decline in productivity from which my grades may never recover. 


* I hate the nagging feeling in the back of my mind that needing medication makes me somehow inferior. 


* I hate that doctors warn me not to tell my friends about what I'm experiencing, because apparently you can get good money selling ADHD meds, and I shouldn't trust that my friends are actually good people. 


* I hate that this medicine doesn't alleviate all of my symptoms, and yet it's still better than not taking anything at all. 


* I hate the extensive mental lists of great ideas that will never come to fruition, and the hundreds of cool projects that I've left unfinished because I can't stay focused for more than a few minutes. 


* I hate when people tell me to just ""try harder."" 


* I hate that it's just not that simple.

1358722798.0,207,self.ADHD,16ycgz,Adderall is changing my perspective on what ADHD really is,hanibash,232,25,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/16ycgz/adderall_is_changing_my_perspective_on_what_adhd/,"I've been on a trial period of Adderall for 4 days, and I'm learning a lot. For the first time, I think I'm understanding what it really is to be ADHD.

The ADHD stereotype is a person who overreacts to inputs that come their way. A butterfly floats by -- ""OOH... pretty, I must catch it"". But after trying Adderall I've now realized that I normally *underreact* to inputs just as often! 

My new view of ADHD is not just that you over-respond to inputs, but that **ADHD is responding to inputs with an inappropriate amount of action, either too much or too little.**

Here's a personal example. Over a month ago, I noticed my co-worker had small tasks like ""call your family"" or ""Take out garbage"" on his calendar. In an effort to get more organized, I decided to do the same thing and added a weekly ""call your family"" event to my own calendar.

Every week, I would see the notification, and even if I was free, I just *wouldn't do it*. There was no good reason. I just simply didn't respond to the input and went back to whatever I was doing.

This week, I had taken Adderall, and for the first time upon seeing that notification, I actually did the thing I had scheduled for myself. It was easy. I just picked up the phone and called, something I hadn't done in a very long time. My mom was so happy to hear from me.

Another example: Normally, if I sit down at my computer and a window is open that has Facebook, it can spell doom for my productivity. I have to rush to close the window as soon as possible or else risk getting drawn in for a very long time.

With Adderall, I neither over nor underreact to the input. I check my notifications, maybe respond to a post or two, and then close the window. No big deal.

And I hate seeing articles with titles like that, articles that espouse the “advantages” of ADHD. What advantages? And you better not fucking say “living in the moment” unless you’re willing to talk about the advantageous ""imagination"" of a schizophrenic or the exiting ""spontaneity"" enjoyed by those with bi-polar. People don’t write articles titled *Why I Love My Borderline Personality Disorder*, so why the fuck do ADHD people write articles like that about their shit? Oh you're creative and imaginative? So what!? You don't need ADHD to be those things.

Here’s my article: It bugs me that I need to use a giant black marker, or I just ignore the notes I write to myself. It’s a waste of paper, especially because I need to write notes for simple things like “wash some underwear.” I hate that I need to check off boxes on a daily reminder chart to achieve things many five year olds already do on their own (Breakfast; Weather; Dress; Brush Teeth…). It reminds me of a preschoolers earning gold stars for not peeing their pants or whatever the fuck you give kids gold stars for. Actually, now that I think about it, they get gold starts for the exact fucking reason I get a check mark - for brushing their teeth and eating breakfast. It's fucking embarrassing and I hide it when friends come over. I hate how it takes my wife an hour to clean the kitchen and it takes me 5 hours. I hate breaking promises. I hate always telling people I will do something, then not fucking doing it. I hate how people I care about interpret my actions, or inaction, as malicious or callous or narcissistic. I hate trying so hard to do right, be proper, and recognize what is expected of me, then being called inconsiderate anyway. I hate how fucking hurt and helpless I feel when people I like judge me based things that never crossed my mind. I hate feeling like a failure. And most of all I hate that I’ll be like this forever. 

I’m always seeing articles about how Richard Branson's ADHD made him a brilliant billionaire businessman. Well that's good for him. My ADHD made me a janitor. If someone told me I could take a pill that would completely get rid of my ADD forever, I would take two.

I think maybe people get attached to their coping mechanisms or something. I'll admit, I feel proud of myself when I look at my little pre-school chart and see no blank spaces. And I'm proud it worked and I had the initiative to make it. But I would throw it away in a second if I could. 

Who the fuck would love this disorder?

We've had a good run but I think it's time to call it quits. I remember coming on here to read interesting articles, scientific papers and videos, and other ADHD related content. Now this subreddit has become a den of absurd realizations and pseudo-supportive feel-goodery.

I've had ADHD for all my life, from a child into an adult. And I've had my good times and my bad times. Do you know at what points my life was the worst? When I felt sorry for myself. When I lamented my 'crippling mental deficiencies'. When I cried aloud ""If only I wasn't so special! I can't be a cookie cutter so I must suffer!"".

But you know what? I got better when I learned something. I got better when I learned that I'm ***not*** special. My problems aren't new. I'm not a paragon of suffering exploring the frontier of unique pain. Sure, my problems may be a little bit worse, and a little harder to control, but I *can* control them.

Anyway, I guess I'll get to my point.

**The general attitude of this subreddit is HARMFUL.** I see everyone embracing that attitude that I once held: that you are special, unable to fit in because you just can't be like all the boring people you like to think the world is made up of. I get it, that thinking feels good. It feels good to be different and to be able to excuse your problems behind a disorder. But that does not help anyone, least of all yourself. The truth is, you're just like everyone else, except you have to try a little bit harder. So stop looking for a way out of it and just try.

Maybe this will resonate with some of you. Maybe it won't...  
.

..

...

***From the moment you wake up, it feels like you're engaged in a constant antagonizing battle with yourself. And you're always losing.***

.

You want so badly to succeed. Always picturing yourself accomplishing things. Always imagining yourself living up to your full potential... *I've got this shit. Today, I get serious.*   

.

You've got an extremely important deadline coming up. You've had weeks to prepare, but you've procrastinated on it. Whatever, nothing new. You're smart. *Really* smart. It might take other people 24 days. All you need is 24 hours. *Seriously just give me 24 goddamn productive hours and I'll crush this shit, I swear to fucking God...* 

.

You're trying so hard to summon the resolve to start... 

.

The clock's ticking. It's been 2 hours. You haven't started yet. You're starting to get a headache. Turn the fan on, the noise of the motor will help soothe the dull pain in your head. 

.

Look, you just need to relax. You still have plenty of time. You're hungry. Grab some comfort food. Those gummies. They're kind of healthy. 200 calories or whatever, but 0 from fat. Plus they're made with real fruit. That way you won't feel guilty as fuck for not going to the gym today. Or all of this week. *Fuck. Whatever. I'll start going again tomorrow.* 

.

Yo, what was that one TV series episode? The one that you love to watch. It always gets you pumped up to do work. Or maybe that one song. The one from the Rocky Balboa movie. *No. Fuck that. Listened to it too much.* Maybe go for a quick run? It'll wake you up. Help with the headache. *Eh.  Maybe later.* Fuck. Get up. You still need to grab those gummies.

.

Nah, hold on. Lets see if any new episodes came out for any TV series you're into. Not to watch it. You know, just to know if it's out. Oh fuck yeah! There is a new one. Just a 30 min one. It's cool. You're kinda tired right now anyway. After this 30 min you'll feel rejuvenated and you'll def start working. 

. 

What a great episode. Good shit. Oh - whatever happened to those gummies? Wtf? You ate them? When? Whatever. No problem. Except, you're still hungry.

.

Lets see what's in the fridge. Wait. Check the cupboards first. Might have some snacks. No dice? It's cool, grab a tv dinner from the fridge. What? All out? *Oh god* The only food left is stuff that you actually have to cook. And it takes like 30 min to make. *You've gotta be fucking kidding me. Why do I even by this shit? It's not like I'm ever going to make it.*

.

The sudden realization that there is no food readily available has made you inexplicably hungrier. You're starving. *Fuuuuccckkkkk.* You can't work on an empty stomach. You- 

.

What? There's popcorn? *Fuck yeah!! Fukken saved.* 

.

You can't just eat popcorn though. You just got out of a tight spot. Gotta celebrate. You should watch that one episode while you eat. Nah hold up. Been a while since you've checked that one site. No, the other one. Oh wait, no it hasn't. You've already checked both like 10 min ago. Hey lets see what's good with that movie. Wait, what's that smell? *Fuck yeah! Popcorn's done!*

.

Oh god. Oh fuck. It's been 5 hours. You've done no work. It's getting dark outside. *Fuck*. What the fuck? Why are you doing this to yourself? *Fuuccckk.* Almost crunch time. Gotta get serious. *Motherfucker, I have been serious. I've been thinking about starting to work every fucking 5 minutes for the last 5 hours. It just keeps getting put off.*

.

You feel sore. Stressed. The ache in your head has gotten worse. Your thoughts are becoming more cluttered. Less focused, more widespread. Less specific, more abstract. You start imagining random scenarios. Creating random characters. Playing out random stories in your head. Interweaving all the things you are thinking about into one giant clusterfuck. 

.

*Fuck. God. Why the fuck is this happening? How the fuck have I not started working yet? Seriously, what the fuck. Where the fuck is my adrenaline, my second wind, my spark? Like, if I don't start working right now, I might actually fucking fail.*

.

The clock reads 10 PM. But it feels like 2 AM. You're tired. You've done next to no work. It's looking like you're going to have to pull an all-nighter. *What the fuck man? Again?* Every fucking time. You put yourself through this shit every fucking time. And every fucking time, you promise yourself that it will never happen again. And yet, here we are...

.

*Whatever. Man the fuck up. This is happening. And you can't afford to crash and burn. Not now. Not like this. This is not how your story ends. Motherfucker, stop dozing off. It's time to kick it into another gear.*

.

You glance at the clock. 2:00 AM. The bits and scraps of work you've done throughout the day are starting to come together. But you're nowhere near finished. Just thinking about the remaining workload makes you more weary. You're tired. So fucking tired...  *Motherfucker, what the fuck did I say about dozing off!*

.

4:00 AM. You're too stressed and tired. Every time your eye lids close, you can feel your eyes burning from staring at the monitor for too long. And they're so tired. You don't want to open them again. Better to just take a quick snooze. 

.

Going to sleep will be a sweet mercy. God knows you could use the much needed rest to clear your head and restore your energy. You'd love to sleep for the next 20 hours. But you know that you're going to have to wake up in just a few hours. You're going to wake up extremely tired and with a headache. But you're going to have a productive morning.

And then the cycle continues.

* Why I've felt weird for spending entire days not doing anything productive while other people seemed to focus just fine.

* Why I've always seemed to drink more and smoke more weed than people around me, but only at night. I thought I was some kind of weird lite-alcoholic, since I never got _really_ addicted and took frequent breaks of weeks and months, but the desire to self-medicate myself into relaxing at night was always there.

* Why I've felt like my brain was just weird for making connections that no one else made, finding solutions immediately that no one else did, and never ever stopping like other people's brains.

* Why I've done some incredibly stupid things lacking foresight, without actually being stupid. Things like not dressing for almost certain weather (well it's warm now!), never packing any kind of lunch (well I'm full now!), and just general ""Well I'm ___ now, so I can't see why I'd need something that I actually know full-well that I will need, but for some reason LALALA OUT THE DOOR I GO"".

* Why difficult projects and tasks involving external pressure have never been a problem, but a laughably easy task with delayed consequences becomes an insurmountable task.

* Why I've felt much more impulsive than people around me. Luckily not to the point of destroying relationships (I think I'm more on the inattentive side, but we'll find out with the doctor next week), but whenever I have an idea or want something, I have to have it NOW NOW NOW! I even did it yesterday; after spending the entire day reading about ADHD, I read about Omega-3 oils being helpful and ran immediately out the the store. At 2am. To buy cod liver oil.

* Why it's always been either all or nothing for me. Either no focus, or insane laser-focus that sucks all energy from me. Nothing in between. No middle ground. No mediocre days where I did a medium amount of work at a reasonable pace spending a normal amount of energy. Either a shitty non-day where I feel like crap afterwards, or an draining focus-thon where I feel like crap because I can't stop and now it's 3am and when did I eat again?

* Why I've way too often had 100% real and honest interest in something, and stuck to it for days or even weeks, and then it just completely disappears from my brain. Not like the interest slowly vanes or something; one day I just never ever think about that thing ever again until it's been a month and I go ""Oh yeah, that thing"". And feel incredibly stupid; why can't my brain at least remind me from time to time? Other people do that, why couldn't I? I guess I know now.

* Why I've been able to read at a blistering pace since I was 4, but have actually read so few books that I feel ashamed. News, forum posts, other bits of information contained in an easily digested pill? I've read more of those than are galaxies in the universe. That's my go-to procrastination coping method; ""I'm reading, that can't be unproductive, right? Right?!"". But I have read the first two chapters of at least 50 books.

* Why I've felt like my brain goes faster than my body. Saying things wrong because my brain had moved on, writing the second letter of a word as the first one because my brain had moved on, pausing for an awkward amount of time while talking because I had to go catch my brain first.

* Why I've... suddenly lost interest in writing this post, and need to finish it and press submit right now before it joins the other trillion things in the half-finished pile.

I'm still processing the revelation I had yesterday, but I'm moving rapidly through the levels of ""what if I knew before I was 28?""-grief, heading for acceptance.

This month I want to welcome Dr. David Nowell Ph.D. [@davidnowell](http://www.twitter.com/davidnowell) who is a clinical neuropsychologist. I met David back in October when he was the keynote speaker of our ADHD conference. I was doing work behind the scenes so unfortunately I could only catch some of his talks, but he has a knack for answering questions clearly and the attendees loved him. 

After talking with him for a bit afterwards I mentioned /r/ADHD just as we were leaving. He was actually familiar with Reddit and said he would check us out. **He wrote a blog featuring /r/ADHD for online peer support a couple weeks later which you can find [here](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/intrinsic-motivation-and-magical-unicorns/201210/online-peer-support-adult-adhd)** (looks like he published this when Reddit was down...or he broke reddit). Later I asked him if he would be interested in doing an Expert AMA on /r/ADHD and he agreed! So here it is!

&gt;David D. Nowell, Ph.D., is a clinical neuropsychologist who teaches workshops internationally.  His passion for teaching has its roots in his work with disorders which limit an individual’s ability to apply self-understanding to day-to-day organization and planning.  A unique aspect of David’s clinical work is his attention to body-based felt experience – what success or happiness “feel like. David has a strong interest in motivation, focus, and fully-engaged living.

* You can start asking/voting on questions right now. David will be by to answer the most popular questions (or questions he enjoys). 
* He will be using the name dnowell (after this week he won't just be a lurker anymore!)
* If you didn't get your question answered last time, feel free to ask again here.
* Questions may not be answered for a couple days! Be patient! **We want everyone to have a chance to ask a question.**

***

*Remember to upvote the questions you want answered (and upvote this thread as well). We want everyone subscribed to /r/ADHD to see this on their front page!*

####EDIT: Dr. Nowell has started answering questions and will do so throughout the week when he has time. Continue to upvote and ask questions! He is still answering as of 2/12/13

You get in a fight with your girlfriend or someone across from you being really loud when you're trying to study? The more you think about it, the more distracted you'll get.

**So open up a word document, type everything you're thinking, and when you've run out of things to type about, enjoy your clutter-free mind and get to studying.**

It definitely helps me, but this may not work for some. I'm moderately-severly ADHD and this is a method I thought up that helps me focus on what needs to be focused on. The point isn't to force yourself to keep your rant going, but whenever you start to find it's hard to write more things, that's when you stop and get yourself to work while your mind is clear.

   -Your brain is kind of like a little kid...if he wants to play, run around, go pee, whatever, let him.

   -Whenever he does everything he desires, he's ready for some relaxing integrals or magnetic flux derivations.

   -While you're doing your important tasks, your mind won't keep wondering, ""Man! I wonder what it'd be like to do a cartwheel"" because he already got that out of the way. Been there, done that, not interesting anymore. Now let's move onto something else.

Please feel free to post your comments, questions, concerns, etc. I'd love to hear if this helps even one person.

Two hours later, I'm crying. 

Everything makes sense. Fucking everything. I've dealt with and been medicated for depression (on and off) for over ten years now, but the idea of ADHD or ADD just never occurred to me (or anyone in my family).

All the depression, anxiety, nervousness, never ending worry, forgetfulness, inability to concentrate (and alternatively, the ability to suddenly become obsessed with one specific thing for days on end), messiness, disorganised lifestyle, procrastination, incredibly complicated, unforgiving, random thought processes;

 I thought I was broken. I thought I just had an inability to relate to other people and to life. I would constantly tell myself that my brain was hardwired wrong and there was nothing I could do about it. I had resigned myself to a life of achieving nothing except superb Internet surfing skills and constantly fucking up jobs. 

Now? I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it's not ADHD/ADD. But everything here. EVERYTHING. It chimes. It makes sense. I feel like maybe there's some hope now. 

I'm making an appointment with my doctor tomorrow.

It wasn't as hard as I imagined it to be (often the case). 

Last year was the first year that I finished my taxes before April in March. This was atypical. Most of you probably are waiting until the last minute...well now is the time to use the impending due date to fire up your brain and get focused on taxes!

I thought I would include some helpful information in addition to this reminder for those of you who are thinking ""OMG that is tomorrow? *""But I am busy today and tomorrow! I have no time. But I hate filling out forms...What am I going to doooo!!!?""*

* Is your adjustable gross income below $57,000? If so you can prepare and file for FREE! Check out this IRS site and prepare your taxes online! Multiple options. http://www.irs.gov/uac/Free-File:-Do-Your-Federal-Taxes-for-Free

* If you made more than 57,000 you can still use the [Free file fillable forms](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Access-Free-File-Fillable-Forms-Here)

* Not sure where you put your tax forms or if you own a business you don't want to add up all those checks you cashed? **File an extension!** Looks like you can easily file an extension using the Free File link above. It takes just a couple minutes IIRC.

#### You will need to file the extension by the due date (tomorrow 4/15/13) so don't put this off! This will give you an extra 6 months to procrastinate!

I will include other useful links if anyone puts those in the comments...Hope this was helpful for someone!

I just felt the need to share these two ""tips"" for those of you who are younger and starting out. I see a lot of comments/threads on this subreddit that concern me, because I feel like some folks are trying to swim upstream, without success. So here goes.

*****

**When it matters, figure out what comes naturally to you, and then do it.**

 Whether it’s selecting your college major, figuring out your career, or determining what electives you take in high school, choose the stuff that comes naturally to you and that you enjoy. If you want a “challenge” by foraying into an area that you aren’t comfortable with, do it on your own time, with something that won’t impact you down the line. 

I learned to fly planes, ride motorcycles and play piano to “challenge” myself. You know what? I sucked at all of them, but at least I tried. Backing out and failing were no fault options. My school grades and my career didn’t take a hit.  Pick electives, college majors and career choices that fit with what you like to do at the time. If you want to try calculus, but you just aren’t very good at it, wait until after you have graduated and then pick it up with a continuing education course where you can fail, and still succeed. You don’t want to have to struggle when your future is on the line.

**Don’t let the fact that you have ADHD define you to others.**

Yes, you may be excited because you’ve been diagnosed and you finally have an “answer”. This site is the place to talk about it. You know the places you shouldn’t talk about it? At school and at work – two places where you will be judged for having ADHD, even if the people you’re talking to don’t necessarily act like they’re judging you at the time.

ADHD is a real condition, but it is heavily misunderstood. Technically, you should be afforded protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act (if you live in the US). But proving that you were passed up for a promotion or treated differently in class because you talked repeatedly about having ADHD is very difficult. 
ADHD is not a shameful secret, but because it is so highly misunderstood, it is one you should only share among your most trusted friends. If you’re thinking about sharing it with your manager, think again. And then think about it again. And think about it a third time. I have shared my “ADHD tendencies” with one manager, but I never shared that I was officially diagnosed.

If all you talk about among your peers, clients, managers and professors is the fact that you have ADHD, then you are emblazoning yourself with a label. They will define you primarily by your disability. They will seek out evidence of your disability in your behaviors, noting behaviors or oddities that they then blame on your ADHD, that ordinarily they would have just dismissed.

You have an advantage that others with physically obvious disabilities don’t have. You know you have a disability, and you can proactively work to resolve issues arising from the disability, all without it being *obvious* to others. The only person who defines you as an “ADHD” person is you. And if you insist on labeling yourself in front of others, you are asking only to be viewed through a lens of “disability”. You can succeed in this world without having to show your hand. Give it a chance. No one cares that you have ADHD nearly as much as you do. And in business, where there's a bottom line, they damn sure won't have any interest in giving you ""more leeway"" just because of that. 

*******

I know it's not a book of tips, and I hope I don't come across as harsh, but the real world is just this way. I constantly see young folks on this sub over-challenging themselves in their schoolwork and trying to define themselves to others with their ADHD. If you'll look to the long term, you'll find that you can do more than you've ever dreamed of, but you have to do it in a way that sets you up for success, not failure. Challenge yourself on your own terms, not the terms of your school or work. And never define yourself by ADHD. You're much more than that and you are selling yourself far too short if you think that's your defining characteristic.",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,1361492759.0,,ORANGE,True,t3_18zlrh,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/18zlrh/two_tips_from_a_41_yo_vp_with_adhd/,

I see way too many topics these days made by people that don't seem to understand the nature of ADHD and therefore what to expect as a result of this disorder.

**Your ADHD does not define your personality, or your likes / dislikes**. ADHD, simply put, just makes you more you. It is an executive function disorder. That means that your high-level control over your brain is limited compared to other people.

To use my earlier example:

&gt;Imagine most people's brains as a big stupid dog. I'M HUNGRY, I EAT. I WANT SUGAR, GET SUGAR. I'M TIRED, SLEEP NOW. THIS IS BORING, DO SOMETHING ELSE.

&gt;Everyone has a leash, in order to control and direct your dog. We can eat later, now is not the time. This is boring, but we have to do it. I know you want sugar but two hundred cookies are not the answer.

&gt;As an ADHD person, you just have a really weak leash so you have a hard time controlling your dog.

I think it's important for everyone to understand ADHD so it doesn't become a ""I hate girls, do you hate girls? Our ADHD makes us hate girls"" kind of forum.

As /r/adhd increases in size, we find ourselves in a critical stage of development. We as a subreddit can either fall into a pattern of repetition (allowing our community to get bored/overwhelmed with repeated topics/questions), lost in a sea of memes/pictures/questions/noise, or we can proactively shift the tides towards making /r/ADHD a perpetually flourishing community based on scientific findings and personal discovery.

***
## The main purpose of this thread:

* Provide a place for people to **ask simple questions** which may not need a dedicated post.
* Give people **new to the  /r/ADHD community (and there are thousands of you)** a chance to say hello and share a bit about their strengths, struggles, and dreams.

***
We decided to start a new weekly thread on Fridays in an **attempt to consolidate the frequent “beginner” questions and introductions into one place.** After discussing this in our [/r/ADHD chatroom](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/ADHD) the conclusion is that we must **address the increase in basic questions posted in /r/adhd.**

***

##### Also, if you’re new to our little community, (or even if you’re not and you just want to do this anyway!) this is the place to say hello!!

*By the way, these threads are going to help build /r/ADHD’s FAQ page, the current version of which can be found [here!](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/ADHD)*

**Studying**
__________

Studying with ADHD is a real pain, so here are some (hopefully) helpful hints and tips.

* Don't do your homework at home.  Seriously, being at home automatically distracts you.  At home you have your laptop, TV, music, etc... And often times when you first get home all you want to do is lie down on your couch and relax for a bit.  Instead do your homework at the library, a nearby coffee house, or some other quiet place in which you can relax and study.  I recommend the library because it is quiet, and you have walls filled with resources all around you.

* If you have to do homework at home make yourself a quiet study corner with no distraction nearby.  Maybe between your bed and a wall, or on a little desk shoved into the corner of the room.  Make sure that absolutely no distracting things are nearby or within reach.  The walls in this area should be empty and boring, your laptop should be t least two rooms away, the TV should not be in the vicinity, and be sure to keep all aquariums and the like far away.

* Set yourself minigoals and time limits.  I'm dead serious when I say that if I don't have a deadline, I won't do it.  If I do have a deadline, I won't do it until the last second.  It's not my choice, I just can't do it.  My solution to this is to set my *own* deadlines, and not the second before it is due.  Say, ""I need to start doing this assignment at 6:00 and it needs to be finished by 7:00"".  If you achieve your goal reward yourself with a break, some food, a walk outside, etc...

* I cannot recommend enough the 15-minute-interval-method (a form of Pomodoro technique).  I mentioned it in my last post, but I will bring it up again here in case some people didn't see it.  Do your work in intervals and it will be much easier to get things done.  For example:

^5:00-5:15 = math homework

^5:15-5:30 = English homework

^5:30-5:45 = Break

^5:45-6:00 = History homework

^6:00-6:15 = Math homework

^6:15-6:30 = Read

^6:30-6:45 = Break

^6:45-7:00 = History homework

Did you notice that on the second round the second interval was no longer English homework and had become Read?  That is because you finished the English homework and now had something new in that time slot.  Name as many time slots for a specific thing as you think you will need.  For example, I usually set out four 15-minute-intervals for my math homework, but only one or two for English.  You should always have at least one break per hour to do whatever you want.

* When doing homework the break is vital.  At least once per hour, for about 15 minutes, you should get up and get a drink and eat some food, then do something you enjoy for a few minutes.  It refreshes your mind.

* Starting late when it comes to studying for tests is bad.  Very bad.  You have to start studying earlier on if you want to do well on the test.  I have as much trouble with this as any of you, but try scheduling a couple of intervals a day to study.  I have found that the intervals are so short that I can just go and study without pouting and feeling bad for myself.  Plus, if you have it on your schedule you *have* to do it.  That is the point of your schedule.  You *can't* ignore it.

Okay that is all I have gotten so far.  I have enough room on this post to add suggestions from the comments so if you have anything to add I would be glad to put it up here.

Hope I have helped,

Peri123

**EDIT**

 From /u/theinklings : In addition to the interval method, I've found that breaking jobs up into ridiculously small tasks works for me as well. If I have 'write journalism article' on my to-do list, and I'm not getting it done, I'll break it into 'transcribe interviews' 'isolate quotes' 'write lead' and so on. For me, it makes tasks less daunting and gives me some easy to reach goals.

From /u/es_aye_em : I totally agree on the part with studying at home. It's difficult because of all the distractions I have around me in the room. Usually what I do when I have some intense studying or project doing at home is I prepare for the day early and quickly (brushing teeth, wash up, eat breakfast, take daily supplements, medicine, etc.) then I have my work station organized, put out my notepad, untangle wires, clear as much things from my desk as I can that I don't need (coin jars, pictures, papers that I don't need to see, etc), just stuff them into drawers or closet, anything to keep them hidden. My desk is in my bedroom, with my back facing away the bed, so I have to make the bed, throw out used tissues, bring my plates and cups into the kitchen, clear things out of the way even though they're behind me and I can't see. Just knowing that my room is spotless and clean puts my kind at ease and I can concentrate better.

From /u/Velocecat : 
Block everything on your computer that you waste time with during the hours you want to be productive.

Don't SIT at your desk. Try a standing desk. Mine is a japanese table on the floor. I sit on my knees and fidget with a pen while working. I can move around a lot and stay on task.

I disable my wifi, or outright close my computer. I listen to classical music or anything without lyrics

I use strict pomodoro to force me to break every 15 minutes. During my breaks I do physical work. Jumping jacks, wandering around, walk around outside. I DO NOT use facebook or reddit during breaks. I find that it gets my mind running and I am still thinking about reddit or FB when I return to my task.

I also have my girlfriend gently remind me when I'm spacing out or wasting time. She keeps me honest. She is hyper organized and I'm very spontaneous. It works out great. Make a friend who is the opposite of you :)

From /u/BCsteve : The absolute most useful thing that I've done to improve my studying is install an application called SelfControl on my computer... (It's got a scary icon, but I swear it's legit.) Basically what it does is irreversibly block a list of websites that you give it, for a certain length of time. For me, that means facebook and reddit. No matter how hard you try, you can't reverse it until the time runs out. So for me, when I get that moment of lucidity where I'm like ""OK. I have to study now."" I'll start the program and block things for around 45 minutes. I find that the biggest problem I have without it is just mindlessly opening up a new tab and flipping to reddit without even thinking about it, then I'll see an interesting post, and that derails my train of thought and it'll be another hour before it gets back on track. With the program running, it'll pop up with a ""webpage not found"" error, and that triggers my brain to go ""oh shit, that's right, I should be focusing!"" Basically cuts the distraction off before it can get started. Then when the time is up, I'll take a couple minute break, surf reddit/facebook, then repeat the cycle again. It's only by forcefully restricting myself that I've managed to get things done.

Also from /u/velocecat : I'd like to add on to your ""don't cram"" thing: it seems common that people in ADHD have a really terrible short term memory.

This ended up being very true when I went through the 8 hour evaluation.

It seems that if I remember something, it is immediately filed into long term memory. I could not process information in the short term with the ""working memory""

This may be true for you all as well, so I can't recommend enough the idea that habits work great for study.
I had a lot of memorization in my pharmacology class. Most of my classmates crammed the week before the test. I broke everything down in flashcards and reviewed them for 15 minutes (seems to be the magic number) every day since the start of the semester.

It took very little time and when I was taking the test, I had absolutely no struggle to recall each of the drugs and their side effects and properties. I was completely stress free, and I'm fairly certain that I attained a high grade. We will see tomorrow...

From /u/V3nturetheworld : I like this list of things! I suggest something to keep you active, I have the Hyper part of ADHD pretty bad and find it hard to sit still (unless i'm hyperfocused on something). I suggest a stress ball to squeeze while you work or chew some gum, keeping your body active helps while working. On top of this I suggest listening to music with headphones, for some reason speakers are distracting to me, and the music should have little to no lyrics as well. I also suggest, while it probably isn't the healthiest thing, is to have lots of caffein such as coffee or redbull to drink (not tons but some just to give you a boost when the meds are starting to not work to their fullest potential), I hear alot of people with ADHD use tobbacco for the nicotine stimulant part, I feel this isn't very healthy in any way BUT if you wish for just the nicotine (highly addictive though) I suggest an Electronic Cigerette or Swedish Snus, those are both the least harmful methods of getting nicotine. Also EXCERCISE IS CRITICAL! I can't stress it enough, especially cardio workouts, I find that If I can exhaust myself from running or biking, I have much clearer &amp; focused mind. Lifting weights does help a bit as well, but I personally believe cardio is better.

Another tip I have learned from a friend. I personally study and do work better early in the morning when no distractions are present. To maximize this I learned that, first you should go to bed earlier then normal, and second set an alarm for a half hour before you want to start working and have a pill near by to take. When the alarm wakes you up take your meds and go back to sleep, have a second alarm set for a half hour later to wake you up, so when this alarm wakes you up the medicine will have kicked in and you will feel focused with a perfect mix of being tired and awake so that you are less distracted by the things around you.

As /r/adhd increases in size, we find ourselves in a critical stage of development. We as a subreddit can either fall into a pattern of repetition (allowing our community to get bored/overwhelmed with repeated topics/questions), lost in a sea of memes/pictures/questions/noise, or we can proactively shift the tides towards making /r/ADHD a perpetually flourishing community based on scientific findings and personal discovery.

## The main purpose of this thread:

* Provide a place for people to **ask simple questions** which may not need a dedicated post.
* Give people **new to the  /r/ADHD community (and there are thousands of you)** a chance to say hello and share a bit about their strengths, struggles, and dreams.

We decided to start a new weekly thread on Fridays in an **attempt to consolidate the frequent “beginner” questions and introductions into one place.** After discussing this in our [/r/ADHD chatroom](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/ADHD) the conclusion is that we must **address the increase in basic questions posted in /r/adhd.**

**Hyperactivity**

For a lot of people with ADHD, hyperactivity isn't so much of a problem.  *Especially* among adult ADHD.  Still, there *are* those of us who still struggle with it.  Here are some tips:

* When you are in one of those situations where you *have* to sit still and you feel physically like you can't still any longer, try curling your toes into your shoes and pushing.  Hard.  This tension can give you a sort of energy release.  Also, try pushing the pads of your fingers together, as it has a similar effect.

* Keep a small lump of no-dry clay, [Finger Fidgets](http://www.therapyshoppe.com/therapy/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=8_1052&amp;products_id=366&amp;sort=20a&amp;page=1), [Ultimate Wire Fidgeters](http://www.therapyshoppe.com/therapy/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=8_1052&amp;products_id=327&amp;sort=20a&amp;page=1), or really anything that works for you with you at all times. Fidgeting has been proven to help with all forms of ADHD (both Attention and Hyperactivity) as it keeps your brain awake and lets you spend less time worrying about what your body parts are doing (happens to me all the time with my hyperactivity) and more time focusing. [Here is an article on the benefits of fidgeting](http://phys.org/news162554898.html)

* Make sure to do some form of exercising every single day, but differ the exercises.  If you want to feel more relaxed during the day, work out in the mornings, right after you wake up.  This will get some of your excess energy out before work/school as well as provide stimulation.  You can also work out before bed and this may make it easier for you to sleep at night.  [Here is an article on the benefits of exercise for ADHD](http://www.everydayhealth.com/health-report/adult-adhd/treatment.aspx)

* If you are in a work atmosphere where this is an opportunity, get up ever 15 minutes and walk around a little bit.  Grab a drink, eat a snack, step outside for some fresh air.  This is especially easy if you work at home.  If you work in a cubicle, even just standing for a minute and stretching can help.

___________________________________________________________

**Impulsivity**

The main symptoms of Impulsivity are doing things without thinking, or saying things without thinking.  Well, here is how you can improve:

* Before you act, take a minute to analyze the situation.  I know how hard this is guys, but before any decision making take a moment to *think*.  Make this a conscious effort.  It will take practice, but eventually you will develop the skills to stop and think before acting.

* Before you just blurt something out, consciously consider what the person you are talking to is saying.  Are they still talking?  Then don't interrupt.  Is what you are planning to say at all related to what the other person was just saying?  Then don't say it.  Again, this is a conscious effort, and you will not gain results unless you work hard at it.  It will be a pain, but you *will* see results.  Think of conversations as time to practice.  When you are chatting with your parents or friends, think about *everything* you even consider saying.  Trust me,  practice makes perfect.

___________________________________________________________

**Inattentiveness**

As one of the biggest issues related to ADHD, Inattentiveness is a huge issue.  Here are some hopefully helpful tips:

1. **Memory**:

Memory is a huge part of inattentiveness, as well as something that pisses the hell out of us. Try these tips:

* Loose objects like keys, phones, wallet, etc... are commonly lost by us ADHDers.  How to stop losing these essential objects you ask?  Bowls.  That is it.  Bowls.  Keep a bowl right inside the door of your house to toss you keys and wallet into.  Put a bowl in your room/kitchen/living room and be sure to put your phone into the bowl of whatever room you are in.  Keep a bowl in your office and put all of your stuff into the bowl when you get there.

* Notebooks.  Notebooks are my everything.  Actually, correction, *notebook*.  Only one notebook.  You do not want to lose this thing, and it is best to have everything in one place.  Put in to-do lists, schedules, reminders, future events... Your notebook is your best friend.  Write everything down.  *Everything*.  If you need to remember something *write it in the notebook*.

* Sticky notes.  Sticky notes are great reminders.  Put a sticky note on your front door saying :

                              Do you have your:

                              Wallet

                              Phone

                              Car keys

                              Anything else you may need

Put the same thing on the door to your office/workplace to make sure you remember it all.  Basically, sticky notes should be everywhere as a trigger to remember something.

2. **Motivation** 

I'm not gonna lie to you, I really wanted to make this guide, but it was a good three days after I came up with the idea before I put butt in chair and got started.  I have this stint where if it isn't due tomorrow, I probably won't do it.  It is time to fix that.

* Come up with a reward system.  For example, ""If I finish this guide I can reddit for 20 minutes.""  It is a short term goal that will give you immediate satisfaction as soon as you have done it.

* Schedule a specific *time* to do it.  Are you gonna do it if it is just sitting on your to-do list?  Hell no.  If you have a specific set time, like 6:00 for example, then you will (hopefully) do it at 6:00.

* Feel free to check out /r/motivation for quotes and such for you to get off your butt and do what you've gotta do.

3. **Inattentiveness**

When I was in fourth grade my teacher called me and my parents in for a private parent-teacher conference.  She told my parents, ""Peri123 doesn't pay attention.  She is either playing with stuff in the cubby under her desk, or she is staring at the pictures on the walls.  She never listens to what I am saying when I talk and oftentimes she will completely miss directions and will panic and ask her class mates to fill her in.  She rarely just sits in her seat and is constantly changing position.  I think she has ADHD.""

She went on to describe a variety of ways to help improve my focus and keep me calm, as my parents did not want me medicated.  Here are some:

* Go into a dark room and eliminate all sources of light.  Take a flashlight in with you, sit down, and turn on the flashlight.  Turn the beam and shine it onto the ceiling, rapidly moving it around.  try to keep your eyes on the beam.  In the dark room there is nothing to look at, so you will automatically want to focus on the light.  It is a good brain training exercise.

* There are websites where you can train your brain to focus better and remember better.  www.lumosity.com is one that I enjoy in particular.

* Try to work in 15 minute intervals.  I have found this incredibly beneficial, as 15 minutes is pretty much my attention span.  I take the items from my to-do list and divide my day into the 15 minute intervals.  Literally my entire day in 15 minute intervals.  Something like this:

^ 9:00-9:15 = Math homework

^ 9:15-9:30 = organize file cabinet

^ 9:30-9:45 = break

^ 9:45-10:00 = History homework

^ 10:00-10:15 = Math Homework

^ 10:15-10:30 = Organize file cabinet

^ 10:30-10:45 = Break

^ 10:45-11:00 = English homework.

If I finish something during that time slot then I can open up all of the time slots I had scheduled for it later on to do what I want.  If I don't finish something in the number of slots I had set up for it, then I change things around or fill in one of my free time slots.  It is really effective and I love this method!  I am thirty times as productive as I used to be before this method!

___________________________________________________________

**Sleeping**

I know there have been other guides on this (and much better than mine, I may add), but I thought I would throw it in anyways.

* Have a glass of warm milk before bed

* Wake up early everyday because then you will get less and less sleep and therefore be more tired when you go to bed at night.  Plus, the day is longer for you and you will do more during the day, which (Again) makes you feel more tired.

* Make sure to get exercise during the day, otherwise energy build-up can be too high and keep you awake.

*  Read before bed.  I always read before bed.  Read until you are practically falling asleep as you read the page and your eyes are slipping out of focus, then lie down and try to sleep.  I guarantee you will sleep better if you read before bed.

__________________________________________________________

**Waking up** 

Boy, this is an important one, as it also directly relates to how easily you will fall asleep that night.

* Set an alarm to go off twenty minutes before you actually need to get up.  Make sure it is an irritating sound that pisses you off until you just have to get up.  Make sure to set the alarm clock a good 10 feet or more from the bed so that you need to actually stand up to turn it off.

* Set another alarm to go off ten minutes after the first one, an even farther distance from the bed.

* Set another one to go off when you actually need to get up.  The second and third are just in case you don't get up on the first one.

* Reward yourself with a delicious breakfast for waking up on time!

 * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**

 * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain.

*I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good, let me know if you want more info.*

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***

* **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**

* **Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!**

* **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**

***

* The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!

* **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!

Hey there. I have ADHD Inattentive type. 23 years old, diagnosed three years ago. This community has been groundbreaking for finding methods to deal with my brain and the ways I can relate to the world. I really love you all! 

I'm starting this post because I've been finding that the more specified I can get with the disorder, the better info I can get on collaborative coping strategies. I've found that people with ""high intelligence"" (IQ 120+) struggle with some unique challenges. The HI thing seems to be divisive, this was not intended. I'm using it as a descriptor to find others who share experiences. This is a thread for sharing stories, tips and links that are specific for this sub-group. Any additions or comments are much appreciated.

1359121046.0,117,self.ADHD,1795i0,I've been seeing two common problems with ADHD on here lately: Here's my failproof solutions.,outshinedmaster,134,17,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1795i0/ive_been_seeing_two_common_problems_with_adhd_on/,"Two problems I've been seeing people have on here often are:
1.) Waking up in the morning.
2.) Starting tasks.

I have some solutions to these problems that I promise if you give a try will work for you. They manipulate the ADHD psyche in an awesome way as far as i'm concerned.

1.) Waking up in the morning: Get as many alarms as you need to wake up in the morning. It's super simple and effective. Even better if you don't have to program them daily, or you can program them for weekdays and not weekends. When I say as many I mean...5,8,20?!?! Doesn't matter. Go to goodwill get all the alarm clocks you need and start setting them up about a minute to five minutes apart in all the rooms you need to go in to in the morning. I put one by my bedside table so I wake up in the morning, I put one in my closet so i'm forced to get out of bed and turn it off, I then grab really warm clothes while i'm there, and the alarm in my bathroom goes off. I go in to take a piss and the kitchen alarm goes off, lo and behold five minutes later the shower alarm goes off. You'll be up at this point trust me. If not keep setting alarms. There is even an android app that does this! It won't turn off until you have reached certain points in your house! No excuses, just solutions!
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/28/sleep-if-u-can-android-alarm-clock-photo_n_1836068.html

2.) Starting tasks: Get rid of your ability to sit down. It seems simple but it works so well. It's infinitely harder to REDDIT standing up. Try it, even squatting is difficult, sitting on a knee hurts after awhile even. Play video games standing up. Your gametime WILL be cut 1/4. Same goes for t.v. Get rid of your chair at work. Comfort is our worst enemy. You will do tasks better and to completion when the alternative is being uncomfortable AND doing nothing. The less you sit down the more tasks you will complete. No excuses! Find a way to make your home and work an area that is intensely uncomfortable/impossible to sit down in.

This is a hard condition to have, but it is totally manageable. You have to be willing to think outside of norms because they won't work for you. We can do anything that anyone else can, we aren't disabled, we aren't impaired, we aren't diseased, we simply have to do things differently than everyone else. We can focus as well as anyone, just not when there are too many distractions, we can be on time just like anyone else we just have to set 20 alarms to do it etc. Whenever I need a solution to a problem, I think ""What would I HAVE to be doing to ensure this get's done?"" and I mean to the EXTREME. How do I make it so NOT completing this task will be very very painful or boring or uncomfortable for me? Those are the enemies of ADHD: Pleasure, Contentment, Comfort. Rid yourself of them and then relish in them at the end of the day when you have conquered the world. Like our hunter forefathers the hunt is not supposed to be fun, eating the meat is! Embrace ADHD in all of it's scrumptrulescence. Stop trying to do what others expect of you in the way they expect you to do them! You can't! Do them in the way that WORKS FOR YOU, even if it seems bizarre to others.

The Kick-Start Sunday, Win-Wednesday, and FAQ Friday posts are probably the most important posts on this subreddit.  Lately, though, they have been getting less than 20 upvotes a piece and not many people actually take the time to comment on them.

/r/ADHD is something like a support group, and the mods are like ADHD coaches (In fact Computerpsych *is* an ADHD coach!).  Kick-start Sunday is where the ""coaches"" and your peers can help you set goals for yourself to both improve your ADHD and improve everything else.  Win-Wednesday lets you brag about your achievements when you complete your goal, because ADHD requires much more positive feedback than negative.  There are **11,570 ReADHDitors subscribed to this subreddit**.  That is a **lot** of positive feedback!  Don't you want a couple thousand people complimenting you?

FAQ Friday is for those posts that don't need/deserve their own post.  Those questions that are asked a *lot*.  Even if something similar has been posted before, it may not answer your question.  Ask questions like, ""Should I switch from Vyvanse to Concerta?"" or ""Should I be feeling this after taking Ritalin?"" or ""Does anybody else struggle in social environments?"" in FAQ Friday!

If difficult tasks are easy for me, why haven't I taken over the world yet?

This mentality has been a prevailing theme of my life. I wonder if procrastination is a learned habit from not being challenged enough in youth: if I don't really care about this book report beyond its effect on my grade, and I *know* I can crank out six-to-ten pages that will get me a B or an A-minus in the last 24 hours before it's due, why should I waste the next month thinking about it at all? Seems reasonable, but we all know what happens when we're out of school and working on a project we actually care about: we think about it *every day*, but just can't seem to keep our nose to the grindstone.

It turns out that I wasn't really supposed to learn about Tom Sawyer in high school; I was supposed to learn how to care about what I'm doing, no matter what it is.

My precocious aptitude allowed me to fart around through all of high school and most of college. The first time I received a failing grade on anything, in my entire life, was in my Junior year of college, when I received an F in Advanced Computer Science Projects. In my defense, the professor presented his reasoning very poorly. In all honesty, however, he could have beamed the truth directly into my brain and I still wouldn't have listened. At the ripe age of 27, I understand now that he failed me not for any of the reasons he stated, but because I *didn't really get anything done*, and he could see, clear as day, that I was wasting my potential.

I was apoplectic (a fun word for ""super-duper angry""), then resentful, then stubborn, and finally, just depressed. I sobbed. How could I fail *programming*? It's what I'm good at! Sure, this was the most ambitious academic task I've ever undertaken: an entire semester working on *one project*. But I did great! Didn't I? Yeah. Of course I did! I convinced myself that I had done nothing wrong, that my professor was a dickbag, and redoubled my efforts next term. The next class I took was much more structured--which didn't seem relevant to me at the time--and I nailed it. Problem solved, right?

It seemed that way at the time. I had always been a great programmer. When I was 12, I got my hands on a Visual BASIC library for controlling the America Online graphical interface, so I whipped up an app[lication] to help me and my buddies keep track of the chatroom-based ""speed-fighting"" RPG we had invented, complete with persistent character sheets and automatic chatroom notifications when someone reached critical health levels.

In high school, they slapped a C++ textbook into the calculus teacher's hands and said ""Computer science is basically math, right? Here, teach some kids to program."" Mr. Powsner, whose lush Ned Flanders mustache and shameless nerdly self-awareness I will never forget, dove into the responsibility with gusto, but made no claim at being an expert on the subject. At that point, I had already taken an individual interest in programming, and routinely finished my work within a few short minutes. After the fifth day in a row that I ended up wandering around the classroom helping other students and resolving quandaries that confounded even the venerable Mr. P, he smiled affably under his 'stache and declared me ""a natural"".

No one ever noticed that I had ADHD. How could I? I was a great student and a (mostly) happy kid. I wasn't being challenged yet.

In my first job out of college, I discovered that caffeine helped me focus, which was fortuitous, because I sat a few yards from a fridge full of free soda. (I was in Ohio, so technically it was ""free *pop*"".) I chugged upwards of three cans a day and inflated to 260 pounds, but I was a goddamn rockstar. The work was challenging, but it was the underdog and I was the champion. I asked for help when I needed it, but I never needed help with the act of programming itself.

I have a unique talent for solving code problems. I spend a long time reading the code, over and over again, letting it form invisible but vital shapes in my mind. I sit in silence, hands off the keyboard, iterating over the infinite permutations and turning the code-shapes every which way. Vanishingly few people can do this with the same consistency and confidence. The flow of the program is like a river, and each logical branch is a tributary. I watch them branch out, and out again, and rejoin the main body, or terminate in an edge condition. I can see the data flowing, transforming from input to output. My hands spring to action: I'm not ready to find the main solution yet, because I must first resolve the myriad mini-problems obscuring it. I refactor. Code shrinks. Five hundred lines become a hundred. One gargantuan chunk of code becomes a dozen smaller, more concise functions. I chip away like a sculptor, deleting more than I add. Two dozen pairs of expert eyes over a half-dozen expert years have passed over this code, but I see patterns that were clear to no one before me. Where ten problems were solved with ten methods, twenty are now solved by two. Now I sit back and visualize the shapes again. Always, without fail, and with caffeine coursing through my veins, the solution comes to me like a philosophical epiphany.

Okay, great. Difficult tasks, easy for me, I'm so cool, yadda yadda. What's my supervillain weakness, then?

Once the health concerns of 1,000+ calories of Coke per day became clear to me, I stopped the chugging. Unfortunately, without the self-medication, I was no match for the twin serpents of Work Stress and Relationship Stress. I fell into a deep depression, almost got fired, and finally began the process of diagnosis and treatment. I've written about all that before.

Without treatment of any kind (neither caffeine nor therapy nor amphetamines), I was hopeless: all I could do was hope that I would stumble upon a period of hyperfocus before the next deadline. My limit was 5 minutes. 5 minutes before the channel changed. 5 minutes before I had to make the decision of what to think about all over again. Barely enough to read a screen full of code. Certainly not enough to cook dinner, or exercise thoroughly, or write an essay. I played a lot of video games: with their juicy interfaces and positive feedback loops, they were one of the only things that could consistently keep the channel from changing.

Now, I'm operating at a more balanced pace. I've found that, with the help of therapy and Vyvanse, I cap out at around four hours. They're not always consecutive, though they sometimes are. Maybe I worked for two hours, cooked dinner for 30 minutes, exercised for an hour, and played guitar for another 30 minutes. If I play my cards right, it can be enough. If I only work for two hours, I can work wonders in those two hours. I can tell when I'm getting enough done or not, in my heart of hearts. When I'm actually working consistently, no one ever bats an eyelash: eight hours of work for the average programmer simply does not take as long for me. Which is lucky, because I can count the number of days I've managed to *really* work for eight *solid* hours in my life without taking my shoes off. Sometimes I have good days, where I can get as much as six or eight hours of focus (which means four or six hours of work and the usual two hours of constructive non-programming activities). Sometimes I have bad days, where all I do is answer e-mails, eat Taco Bell, and jerk off before bed. Sometimes I still feel crushingly guilty about these days, but I know I need them in moderation. *In moderation* is the important part.

I often wonder--fantasize, really--about what it would be like if I could ""just get over it"" like people have told me to do for my entire life. I think about what I could accomplish if I could ""just make it happen"". If I could ""just use my willpower"". If it takes me two hours to do what many couldn't accomplish with two days, or in some cases, two weeks, what would it be like if I could really consistently sustain my focus for six hours, or eight hours, or sixteen hours? When I was first diagnosed at 23, I tended to cap out at two hours. Will I keep getting better at focusing, so that by the time I'm thirty, I'm up to six? Will I make leaps and bounds, or backslide? Will I have an epiphany tomorrow, and claim every waking hour as a mindful period of edifying accomplishment? What would I do with all of that power? What kind of structure can I introduce into my life that will get me closer to that?

I was wondering if any others with ADHD (particulary PI) have experienced a noticeable lack of empathy towards others, or just difficulty becoming enthusiastic/emotional about anything at all.  I have friends who I do care about, but I find that I'm always so lethargic and stuck inside my own head, that I have trouble empathizing with others when they come to me for support.  For example, my best friend came over the other day having just found a good job after months of unemployment, and he was crazy excited and wanted to tell me all about it.  A normal person would be happy for their friend, but I just felt indifferent.  I went through the motions and congratulated him, asked him about his job, etc., but found I didn't feel any sense of excitement or happiness that I assume is normal in a situation like that.

At that moment I realized that I had been the same way for as long as I can remember.  Even with past girlfriends, they'd come to me crying about the loss of someone close to them, and I would comfort them to the best of my ability.  But as horrible as it makes me sound, I just couldn't feel sad for them, even though I really did care about them.  I feel like i'm emotionally stunted, and would give anything to be able to sympathize with others, or be happy for others achievements.

Even beyond empathy, it takes a lot to elicit any sort of emotional response for me, whether it be sadness, happiness, anger, etc.  I realize that what i'm saying probably sounds like depression, but I truly don't think that's the case.  I don't feel depressed about anything, and I'm actually quite content with the way my life has turned out so far, even in spite of my ADHD.  I've never had suicidal thoughts, my upbringing was quite normal with great parents, and I don't think poorly of myself (aside from the issue i'm discussing here).  To me it just feels like there's this thick fog inside my head that makes me feel completely detached from myself, and it causes me to have difficulty getting emotional/enthusiastic about anything.  The best way I can describe it is just an overwhelming sense of apathy.

So is it just me?  are there are any of you out there who've had similar experiences, and did getting put on medication help at all?

5. **No posts asking about drug side effects.** Search google or ask in the weekly medication thread. 
        
* Side effects vary person-to-person. Every person has a unique reaction to medication.
        
* Talk to your doctor (or your pharmacist -- they are specialized doctors) about the side effects! Set an appointment or call and leave a message.
        
* This information is easily found online at [drugs.com](http://www.drugs.com/sfx/adderall-side-effects.html) or many past addforums.com forum posts.

#6. No AMAs which are not pre-approved by the mods.  (See #2-5). *We want to make sure the person doing the AMA has unique experience and knowledge.*

## Community Guidelines
**The mods can only do so much and we really need the whole community to help make this the best place possible. Here are some guidelines which would really help /r/adhd out!**

1. **UPVOTE UPVOTE UPVOTE the good (constructive/positive, not merely the ones with which you agree) posts/comments!** This will bring quality posts to peoples frontpage (not everyone visits /r/adhd), helps bring quality threads to the top (and makes listing by top threads of the month more useful), and is just a nice thing to do. 
2. If you see a **post/comment which violates the rules downvote AND click the report button.** This will flag it for the mods.
3. If you see a post that politely adds to discussion *even if you don’t agree with the content,* upvote it.
4. Be civil and respect everyone’s opinion.

***

## Possible future weekly/bi-monthly  threads
*To help the clutter/overwhelm we have come up with some ideas for more weekly threads.*

* **welcome new members...introduce yourself here** *Cut down on the I just got here and...threads*  
* **medication question thread**

•	It’s telling yourself you’ll get started early when you know you won’t even start until after the deadline.

•	It’s having 30 tabs open at any given time.

•	It’s frustration at the fact that the perfect version of you is just out of your grasp. That if you could just get your shit together, you would be awesome. 

•	It’s becoming a master liar so that you can avoid turning in assignments.

•	It’s being frustrated that you can ace a test by cramming from a summary sheet on the way to class but that you can’t write that damn essay.

•	It’s going off on a strange train of thought and then realizing that you are in an exam and have just wasted 10 minutes.

•	It’s the pain you feel when people tell you to “just do the work” and your frustration when they ignore your explanations about how hard that is.

•	It’s having the occasional gold few days of productivity that make your teachers wonder why you’re not always like that.

•	It’s mastering the art of looking like you’re working – playing Minesweeper while watching TV to make it look like I’m doing something active.

•	It’s that hollow feeling in your chest and the desire to cry because you just can’t do it.

•	It’s dreading any week with multiple deadlines.

•	It’s frustration at taking IB.

•	It's being great at menial tasks because all you have to do is work in the moment.

•	It’s the knowledge that you could have so much stress-free free time.

•	It’s the knowledge that you should probably pull an all-nighter to finish all the work you’ve put off, then going to sleep anyway because you know you won’t do it.

•	It’s procrastinating on work that’s been overdue for weeks.

•	It’s that feeling you don’t have the right to complain because your problem seems like such a small deal compared to others’ problems.

•	It’s your parents not taking you seriously when you ask to seek help.

•	It’s taking complicated routes to class so you can avoid all the teachers you owe work to.

•	It’s pretending you’re sick you can avoid turning in the work, and then wasting your sick day instead of being productive.

•	It’s “breaking” every time management method after a small golden period where it works.

•	It’s being perfectly organized – knowing exactly what you need to do and when you need to do it – and then not doing any of it.

•	It’s getting perfect grades and then having your teacher complain about your lack of effort and how you “coast”. 

•	It’s actively avoiding work because your to-do list is so daunting.

•	It’s hating yourself for being so lazy.

ADHD is so often presented as a male issue, especially with hyperactivity. With a few exceptions, we women tend to be daydreamers. We're mostly PI, although some of us can be Combined. (I am, due to being inattentive and also impulsive, but *not* hyperactive at all.)

Please tell us about yourself? What's your diagnosis? Do you fit the ""female ADHD"" mold of PI, or do you break it with some good ol' fashioned hyperactivity?

What meds are working for you? Which have not? How have you handled meds and your pregnancy, if you've had children? I was surprised to read that one woman noticed her menstrual cycle included several days where, due to hormonal reasons, her ADHD meds just don't work. Do you notice that too?

(Courses are blacked out because it is easy to identify me, since not alot of people take these courses)

For the first time in my life, I feel proud, and because of that, I feel that I owe all of you my thanks.

I was diagnosed in my first year of college (these are my spring, sophomore grades). I went from getting 2.8 (C+'s/C's) in my classes, and even being on academic suspension because of this. Before I was diagnosed for ADHD, I had been diagnosed with depression, general anxiety disorder, social anxiety, OCD, and a bunch of other stuff, before realizing that ADHD was also there. ADHD prevented me from staying awake in class, prevented me from understanding material, and prevented me from being punctual. Depression didn't help, because even in the back of my mind, I never felt like a normal person, and that I never belonged. 

I decided to get help, and see a psychiatrist (who specialized in anxiety, depression and adult ADHD (I didn't know this when I first saw her, she was in my insurance network)), after reoccurring suicidal thoughts. I worked on my depression and anxiety problems, but I still had my problems. 

When we diagnosed ADHD as a source of my problems, it was a real turning point, and was one of the happiest days of my life, not because I had ADHD, but because I found a source for my problems, and now it could be treated. Since then, I have made it my goal to stay organized through sets of post-it notes (to keep important reminders in check), calendars, and a whiteboard accessible at all times (to jot down notes).  Medication has helped too. 

To anyone who thinks they might have ADHD, or needs help in school, believe me when I say, get help, and help yourself. If you think you might have ADHD, see a doctor. You won't lose anything, you can only win. However, medication is not the cure all. It helps you focus and motivate yourself, but the rest of your power comes intrinsically. 

Do whatever you feel will help you make a difference whether it comes to reading, or staying organized. Don't slack off. Don't procrastinate. Time is short, remember, and our problem sometimes is that we forget that time is short. Remind yourself, and above all else, stay calm. 

/r/ADHD, Thank you. Thank you for making me feel like I'm not the only one out there, and thank you for making me feel normal. You honestly don't know how much it has meant when you guys converse on this subreddit.

But, I can't relate to most of it. I'm in my mid-40s and have different perspectives, issues, and support needs simply because of where I am in my life. 

For example, I think that I accidentally owe a shit-ton of taxes from last year and am not quite sure how I got into the situation and would like to talk with or get some advice from other ADHD-ers about it.  

... those who might have oopsed the same thing at some point in their lives, and how they got out of it or dealt with it.

What makes me so sad is my social awkwardness. 

I hardly talk to people because I can't keep up with conversation. I hardly talk, period.  But I want to. I have nothing to contribute because my mind goes blank and I daydream so much. Someone could tell a story and I'll miss the punch line because I'm day dreaming. I've missed out on a ton of good memories and... my mind blanked out as I'm typing this. In my defense I just came back from drinking at a party as I attempted to go out with some friends from my high school. I force myself to go to these as I feel that they might help with my ""depression"" or whatever the fuck it is. I end up going and just talking small talk with people because that's all I know how to do anymore. I've spent years covering up my attention problems and I've been trying to treat it with antidepressants but I just don't think that's the problem anymore. I'm extremely depressed because I can't focus on anything and it's just creating this massive snowball effect of depression that's effecting me physically too. Sorry this probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense because I'm still a little drunk and my organization skills are horrible anyways. I really want to get to a psychiatrist as soon as possible (again) and put back on ADD meds (which I have tried before but hated the side effects so i quit them) and find ones that don't cause so many side effects but it's hard because I have no insurance right now. I'm trying to fight through these college classes and hate myself for failing because I'll sit down and try to do homework for hours but just daydream every two seconds. I literally sit there at my computer screen thinking about nothing and getting frustrated at myself for not understanding chemistry. I've been trying to figure out what's wrong with my for so long and I just want it to be out of the way so I can be a kid and actually enjoy college. So far it's been nothing but a fake smile on my face, forcing myself to go out with my friends (and hardly talking to them when I go out because I can't keep up with conversation) and trying to cure this depression or ADD or whatever it is. I hate my brain.




TL/DR: Do you think if I get put on the right ADD meds, it could cure my depression problems too?

For many, amphetamine/methylphenidate meds carry the side effect of drying the mucus membranes of the mouth and sinuses. Another common side effect is poor circulation to the gums. And (if you're like me) it's easy to smoke a large amount of cigarettes without even realizing it. All of this turns your mouth into a septic tank. Think about it. As you may imagine, hosting the bacterial equivalent of a toilet bowl in your mouth is hard on your immune system. Also, having a dry mouth/throat/lips all the time is fucking uncomfortable. If you find yourself getting sick more frequently since starting stimulant medication, and/or constantly suffering from cotton mouth, try brushing, flossing and mouth washing neurotically. 

I find this helps my overall well being a shit-ton. I always got a super dry mouth and throat when I first started taking medication for ADHD , and I think the dryness caused me to get sick way more often than I did before. The dry would lead to being sore and inflamed, which would lead to being sick. On top of that, sleeping with a dry mouth/throat/nose was very uncomfortable too, and stopped me from ever getting into a really deep sleep stage.

I started violently flossing (strangely satisfying on the meds I have to say) as well as using mouth wash a few times a day, basically when my mouth felt dry. It ended up making life much more comfortable for me. I now don't constantly have cotton mouth, or feel like I have bad breath. I stopped getting sick all the time as well, once I had started doing this for about 3 weeks. I can't really say for sure that those things are correlated, but it seems to make sense that not having a dry, inflamed virus farm in my throat all the time would lead to better health.


I'd recommend a wash like [biotene](http://www.cvs.com/shop/product-detail/Biotene-Mouthwash?skuId=414117). It tastes like a raw dick, but that's only because it has enzymes to promote a healthy balance of all the shit that lives in your mouth.

*Just wanted to remind people to **upvote this post**. Recently, our weekly threads get pushed off the page pretty quick. More upvotes = more wins = more people getting inspired (it is a cycle).*

#####Science behind Win Wednesday

* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.
  * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.

* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field. 
  * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**
  * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain. 

*I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good, let me know if you want more info.*

***

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***

* **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**

* **Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!** 

* **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**

***
* The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!

* **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!

1358958270.0,83,self.ADHD,174mk9,[Story]This reddit is helping me save my relationship and I would like to thank all of you,Mister_Kipper,87,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/174mk9/storythis_reddit_is_helping_me_save_my/,"**The Story**

Hello everyone, I'm a 20 year old game design student from Brazil with ADHD - and so is my girlfriend.

As you all know, this leads to several implications - but mainly it caused our relationship to rapidly decay into a state of lethargy; we knew what we had to do, we always made plans we always knew what we wanted out of our future or the very day we were in... and yet we rarely got off our asses to go towards any of that.

Until you helped me understand what ADHD really is, I did not know that it related to feeling unmotivate"" and being generally seen as lazy - I only knew about the basic attention issues and fidgeting. After learning a little more about the subject, I reached a critical point - basically a crisis in the relationship.

Thanks to all of you I was able to figure out a solution.

**The problem**

The main issue, as you may know, is that neither of us had any real motivation to make a move. Living comfortably without doing much, we  could never fathom how important it was to get everything started (and finished).

I've been basically alone in the house while she spends a few weeks at her mother's. In this state, I simply felt a lack of motivation to do anything at all, I'd rather distract myself than eat, shower and sleep properly. Right before reaching a ""critical"" state, I found this subreddit.

**Finding a solution**

Thanks to knowing what the real implications of having ADHD were, I was able to notice how my partner had improved thanks to constant motivation and gratification, while I rapidly decayed.

I also remembered how I was a complete pest when younger, and every one of my habits started making sense. From kindergarten to second grade, I would often throw temper tantrums after being irritated and become very violent - by the very moment my grandmother said ""Every time you do that, I'm gonna give you an ice-cold shower"", I started to control myself - knowing the that acting this way would instantly result in something I considered completely awful made me acknowledge this and control myself.

**The crisis**

A couple of days back, I decided to show the very important video in the FAQ section to my girlfriend and talk to her about it. It didn't work all that well, she felt burdened by my emotional distress and felt like she was too young for this, without grasping how a simple change could both improve this for both of us as well as spicing things up.

I broke into a monologue where I explained how this was not a burden, you weren't going to carry anything or be thrown into a completely adult world. I told her adults don't know how to be adults and that my proposition was exactly the opposite - let us be kids again.


**The idea**

The concept is fairly simple - you're supposed to bring imaginary rules and challenges into your partner's life as well as your own... along with rewards you both know you want. This has to start with each being capable to deny the other something that put you in a comfort zone and you always took for granted (ie: cuddling to sleep, eating together).

The way this works is I can propose a challenge to her, making up rules, penalties and rewards - and she's supposed to do the same for me. We can poke fun at each other's flaws and make sure we do what we have to do to live well while having fun.

By making these challenges we can easily be productive while feeling better, the reward is never too far off! We're getting back into good habits we lost, interests that disappeared and everything that made us interesting for one another.

I'm not sure if this was clear enough or rather confusing - so I'll leave an example of one of the first challenges I made for her:

Objective: Make a challenge for me (to get this started)
Penalty: Until you do so, no smooching and no talking about or interacting with our cats.
Reward: Removal of the penalty


**Conclusion**
I really don't know if I was clear enough, or if it's somewhat mumbled up - but I just wanted to tell you that I was only able to understand and start fixing our lives thanks to the members of this subreddit.

A big awkward hug to all of you - I certainly hope I didn't make too many mistakes or misunderstand what I've learned and that this experience may help at least one of you in your relationship :)

**TL;DR:**
A couple, madly in love, where both the boyfriend and girlfriend have ADHD and were having various issues is now able to make it work by challenging and rewarding each other constantly - and this was only possible because of you, 'reADHDitor'!

It had a nearly silent vibrating alarm and was extremely easy to set. No twisting of tiny dials, no repeated pressing of buttons. It was analog! You rotated the ring around the watch face and pulled a knob. I could set it in about a second flat and without it being obvious what I was doing.  
  
http://forums.watchuseek.com/attachments/f71/183861d1241665552-recommend-affordable-analog-alarm-you-can-hear-watch-80-.jpg

I set alarms for EVERYTHING. If I knew I needed to do something more than 30 seconds in the future, I set the alarm. It would go off and alert me to pay attention and take care of something, and nobody else would know.  
It got to the point where people thought I was unusually conscientious and on top of things. Almost time to take the pizza out of the oven? I'm already over there. 3/4 of the way through lunch time? I'm getting ready to head back to work. 5 minutes before a meeting, and I'm interrupting an engrossing conversation about a new project so we won't be late. It was like a secret super power.  
  
The important thing was that I had one internal, unbreakable rule. The watch will not be ignored. Ever. If I started blowing off the alarm, it would all be over.  

I have no natural sense of time. None. I can't even estimate. This watch was a godsend.  
  
And now it's broken and Timex doesn't make them anymore. Someone help me. It was Timex model T41701, or very similar. There are a fair number of hideous plastic digital watches with vibrating alarms, all requiring awkward button pressing to set the alarm. If it's not super easy to set the alarm, there's no point. 

Does anyone know of a nice, easy to set vibrating alarm watch? Or an alternative solution that's just as easy? I've tried various apps on my phone but none really get it right, and requirement that I have a password on my phone slows me down, and I just can't establish the habit. 

**UPDATE:**  
Thanks everyone for your help and recommendations! normous found a store that had one in stock, which I have since ordered. I'm excited, but we'll see if they actually have it. I've been burned before. For the rest of you, here are the most promising options found so far:
  
**MuteWatch : http://mutewatch.com/pure-black  $259.00**  
This one has a pretty slick touch-based setting system, and is definitely the most promising digital option I've found. See it in action: http://mutewatch.com/video

**Analarm : http://www.retailfacility.co.uk/watches/87-analarm.html  £269.00**  
This one requires twiddling a knob to set, but has a big bar you pull or push to turn the alarm on and off. It also seems to be exclusively for alarms less than one hour in the future (I could be wrong) so that seems to make it quite useful for the way I normally use mine.

**Bulova Men's 98A000 Marine Star : http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0013EG1UA/  $239.85**  
Another knob-twiddler. It's a pretty nice looking watch. 

**Serene VibraQuartz : http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003I7YKO4  $103.00**  
Knob-based setting, no reviews

For those who are more patient than I am, here's an inexpensive button-set digital watch with vibrating alarms:  
**Timex Expedition Vibration Alarm : http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004GHLEMQ  $34.22**  

And for those who value speed over discretion, here's the quick-set analog model with an audible alarm:

1358808579.0,82,self.ADHD,170mor,Having trouble sleeping? I wrote a guide for everybody who is staring holes in the ceiling.,airiin,93,11,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/170mor/having_trouble_sleeping_i_wrote_a_guide_for/,"First of, I am not a doctor. I have ADHD and Borderline Personality Disorder, ever since I was a kid I've had sleeping problems. I'm 23 now, and my psychiatrist sent me to the hospital for my sleeping problems, because there was nothing left she could do. At the hospital they sent me home because nothing they tried worked. Now that I get dexamphetamine, every night has become an even bigger battle. I see a lot of posts here from people asking for advice on sleeping, so I decided to write a guide. Feel free to add your own tips and tricks! English is not my first language, so forgive me my mistakes. 

~

**Sleeping starts with waking up**

I know the feeling. Your alarm bell rings at 7 o'clock, you fell asleep at 5, surely you deserve another few precious hours of sleep? Well, NO. If you decide to sleep in (and as a lazy college student that's a really easy decision to make) you won't be able to fall asleep the following evening. If I wake up tired, that means I have a slightly better chance of falling asleep without a struggle the following night.

~

**Food**

Make sure you eat enough during the day. When I take my dexies, I tend to forget meals and have absolutely no interest in food whatsoever. With a BMI of 16 (I kid you not) that's not a very healthy thing to do. Eat well during the day to ease the comedown of your meds in the evening and to give you the energy to make it through the day.


Try to eat a lot of fruit and veggies. Even though vitamin C makes your urine acidic and causes meds like dexamphetamine and adderall to be flushed out of your system quicker, make sure to eat your greens. In the evening drinking a lot of juice could possibly even make you sleep better because it gets your meds out of your system. No scientific source for that one though...

Don't drink caffeïne, ever. It stays in your blood for way longer than you think (half life is 5 hours, so after 8 hours it's still in your blood!) and causes problems when you try to fall asleep. Tea also contains caffeïne! Try and drink herbal tea instead.

Don't eat a lot of sugary goodness after dinner either, when you have munchies: eat cheese or something.

~

**Exercise**

Make yourself tired. I own a horse, I like to go to the stables in the evening and be busy there. Especially when you do a desk job or anything else that requires you to be inside a lot, getting outside to exercise is great. Going to the gym exposes you to a lot of lights and loud music, not so great for winding down after a long day. Take a walk outside instead. 

~

**Lights**

Like I said above, try to go outside in the evening. Your body makes melatonin in response to ambient light, walking/running/cycling/sitting in an environment that gradually gets darker gets your body prepared for sleep.

Switch your tv and computer off 2 hours before bedtime, read a boring  (!!) book, paint something or talk with your roommates instead. Dim all the lights in the house, if you have to use your computer install f.lux and dim the screen.

If you don't mind looking dorky, /u/eawsound recommends orange glasses that block blue light, wear them in the evening.

~

**Going to bed**

Go to bed when you are tired. Make sure your bedroom is full of fresh air, no tv's or other screens allowed. Switch your phone to airplane mode, set your alarm and don't browse Reddit or Facebook. Do a relaxation exercise, ideas are listed below. Don't get mad at yourself for not falling asleep! If you are unable to fall asleep after 30 minutes, get up and read a book in a really uncomfortable chair until you get sleepy again. 

If you are sleepy and can't fall asleep (like I have all the time) don't get mad or frustrated. You are lying in bed, it's nice and warm and comfy there. Think about whatever you are thinking of. No sweat. When you get mad at yourself it will only get harder to fall asleep. Just lying there is really nice, just like snoozing is in the morning. When you get frustrated, get up and read a book or something. I love painting, so I get out of my bed and paint.

It's important to keep your bedroom for sleeping and having sex only. Don't watch tv, browse on your laptop or tablet or even read a book there. When you associate your bed with sleep, it will be easier to fall asleep there. 

If you can't sleep and you've tried everything, don't get mad at yourself. Enjoy lying in your bed and not having to do anything, it's quiet and dark, snuggle a bit deeper into your soft warm blankets, it's nice lying in bed!

~

**Relaxation exercises**

There are a million relaxation exercises available online. Try searching youtube for 'sleep meditation' and do a meditation exercise before going to bed every night. I like doing these exercises, because they empty my head a bit. Try looking for Yoga Nidra exercises, they are nice and long and are designed to get you in a lucid dream-state. When I really can't sleep I do one of those, while my head isn't really sleeping at least my body can relax.

I'll write a bigger guide to relaxation exercises. For now, a tip from /u/Lionflower13 : listen to a classical music podcast and a tip from /u/BlackFallout : use your imagination, imagine a place where you want to be or imagine you're a superhero. Another tip from /u/flunkorg : get a massagechair. Just don't fall asleep in it while it's on...

!!**I finished the guide! You can find it [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/171eja/you_guys_liked_my_guide_to_sleeping_heres_a_guide/)**!!

~

**Finding a balance in your medication**

I've noticed I fall asleep easier about 3-4 hours after I've taken my meds (10 mg dexies, IR). If I take the last dose 8 hours before bedtime I'm not going to fall asleep.. Some people really can't take them in the evening, while others sleep just fine right after taking a dose. Try and find your own balance.

I also take the weekends off, I don't take my meds and allow myself to sleep as much as I want. After a week of dexies I'm really exhausted and not a very fun person to be with.

~

**Supplements**

Some things that might help, some supported by science and some not:

- Melatonin (supplement) avalaible from your doctor and your local pharmacy

- Magnesium (supplement) available from your local pharmacy (thanks to /u/eawsound )

- Valerian (herb) 

- Lemon balm (herb) 

- Passionflower (herb)

- Hawthorne (herb)

- Warm milk

And if none of the above help, I smoke a bowl... I know benzo's and other sleeping pills help, but they don't prescribe them anymore in the country I live in and I also don't want to take them.

~

Well, I hope there's some useful information in here and I didn't type it all out for nothing. Feel free to add to this list or correct any mistakes I've made.

This is a list of things I have tried to better my life with little to no success, before realizing it was ADHD. They are in the order that I have tried them, this has been an over-a-year-long process.

==

1. **Excersize**. - I was out of shape. So, I figured if I lost the weight, I would become smarter and have more vigor. After three weeks of P90X, I started feeling a bit more active and energetic, but that went away. Soon, the workouts became boring and I had to trudge through them just to stay active the whole hour.

2. **Eating super healthy foods**. I like doing keto, as carb-full foods put me to sleep and send me further down into a fog. I ate a salad full of greens and vegetables one day and realized just how energetic I was that day and thought it was my diet that was the problem. So I started eating tons of vegetables and tried to get all the nutrients I needed from supplements and any kind of source I could get my hands on..

3. **/r/nofap** - What a load of bull. Literally no effect.

4. **Chicken livers**. - Sometimes anemia will put people into a fog. I thought I had low iron in my blood, so I took to eating livers and iron-rich foods. Again, I felt better, but that wore off after a day or two.

5. **Ketosis** itself. - Still thinking it was my diet, I went into full ketosis one day and felt great for the next few days, I thought I was cured, because the feelgood period lasted quite a while (5 days). Then, it wore off again.

6. **Self-diagnosis** - ""Man, something is wrong! Why do I feel good on some days, but feel like crap most days? Let's google this shit! ... okay, *depression symptoms*... oh my god, I have depression! I didn't feel sad... well maybe I do... but I don't feel suicidal."" Later on, ""hmm, I go through 'periods' of good and bad, like a wave. Let's... *bipolar symptoms*. Oh my god, I have bipolarism! This explains everything!""

6. **Counceling** - At my college, they offer counseling for free, it's basically a therapist without the PHD and drugs. I saw this girl about 4 times and had trouble even explaining everything to me, I felt very uncomfortable and I felt like she had no clue what she was doing. She was an intern.

7. **B12** - I can really see the relationship between having energy and being happy/able to focus. B12 vitamins had no noticeable effect.

8. **Meditation** - This actually helped with my negative self-thought, depressed symptoms. But I do not have more energy.

9. **[Breathing exersizer](http://www.amazon.com/Ultrabreathe-ASI7492-Compact-Breathing-Exerciser/dp/B0000E2PBX/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365539345&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=breath+exerciser).** - Around the time I started using one a few times a day, I noticed feeling better, but I have lost the damn thing. I will get one again and see if anything improves. Breathing heavily for a minute or so seems to have a calming effect.

10. **Coffee** - this is the only thing that has any kind of effect, but it's very finicky, some days it doesn't want to work for me.

11. **Finally finding out** - ""Ugh, I don't even know what to do at this point, I guess I'll go to reddit, yeah /r/all. Oh, what's this? A /r/bestof post of somebody explaining what ADHD feels like? Sure I'll bite, I like getting other people's perspectives. Whoa, I feel like that, whoa, that too... whoa, and that. I thought this was a fake disorder?"" Then I found this subreddit and some of the videos explaining in detail what ADHD is. Holy crap! This is crazy.

12. **Doctors** - 

Me: Hi, I'd like to get tested for ADHD.
Doctor: You don't have ADHD, you'd be bouncing around the walls.
Me.... *cry* sorry I'll go now...

Then I found a different doctor who actually knows what she's talking about, and did not belittle me or feeling the way I do.

1. Thou shalt eat before partaking of the sacrament

2. Thou shalt measure out the portion of the sacrament desired, and diminish this portion by one-fourth

3. Thou shalt not partake of the sacrament after a night of sleep has been lost to the sacrament's powers

4. Thou shalt not take the sacrament through the nose, or the ass, of through thy veins, or by burning it and inhaling the fumes. For all who partake of the sacrament in such ways are truly lost on the path.

5. Thou shalt drink the pure waters while partaking of the sacrament, lest thou fucking die

6. Thou shalt measure out a portion of magnesium, and one of ascorbic acid, and a third of n-acetyl-cysteine, so that thou mind be not defiled.

7. Thou shalt not corrupt the sacrament by gazing upon internet images of human flesh, for surely the evil one shall tempt thee into marathon wanking sessions

8. Thou shalt ignore feelings of euphoria produced by partaking in the sacrament, for these are but illusions and lead not to good works.

9. Thou shalt respect the sacrament at all times, for it is truly a double edged blade. Those who adhere to the true and holy path shall receive a great blessing and their hands shall do great work. Those who fall into darkness and temptation risk the ultimate destruction of their soul.

10. Thou shalt never share of the sacrament with they neighbor who hast no need, for he shall surely covet it and become as the degenerate speed freak who sucks cock for meth

11. Thou shalt commit thyself to visitations with the scribe of one's sacrament no less than twice yearly; never hesitate to consult with said scribe when one's sacrament provides non-righteous experiences such as excessive weight loss, excessive headaches, insomnia, or if one's sacrament loses its power of righteousness.

By time I get to the next room, I've often forgotten why I was going in there in the first place. 

**So now, before I start walking, I stick out the index finger of my left hand and assign it meaning, like, ""Get husband's sweat pants.""**

I also use this technique when talking to people so that I don't forget the important things that come to mind while they are speaking. 

**When I think of something I really want to say, I stick out the finger again and wrap my idea around it.** 

This is especially helpful when the thing I thought of is unrelated to the conversation at hand. For example, my husband was talking about Elizabeth Warren's attempt to reinstate regulations on banks. 

While we was talking, my mind birdwalked:  Elizabeth Warren -&gt; female politician -&gt; I wonder if husband will vote for Hillary in 2016.

Rather than ask him this when he takes a breath, I mentally wrap my question around my finger and can hold it there until it's appropriate to change the subject.

The beauty of all of this is you have 10 fingers. I've been able to hold up to 3 thoughts using this finger trick.

* carabiner keychain with car keys and even bi-fold wallet attached to belt strap or purse (cross body bags are great for us with ADD!!)

* Bowl on table where I place my keys/wallet everyday when I get home from work

* Custom Desktop Backgrounds on Paint with Lists of things to Remember

* Leave a toothbrush/phone charger/etc at close friend's homes

* Basket in bathroom to store all make-up products

* Always email myself a copy of papers/documents etc

* Use Google Voice (in Gmail) to help you find your lost cellphone! 

* Along those same lines- download Where's my Droid/Iphone? Great App

* Associate certain pockets or purses/jeans for different things- cell phone in front left/ car keys in inside pocket etc. Try to place in the same spot every time. Learn to do the 3 step pat ""cell phone? keys? Wallet?"" check upon leaving every place. I mean EVERY haha

I'm just about to attend college in May (as an adult) and have noticed while reading some refresher materials that I have to read each word with purpose or else I'll start to skim very heavily. I got a 97 in reading and a 99 in writing on the COMPASS placement exam in spite of my bad habit. I've done this my entire life yet I feel like it used to be easier to read books. Wondering whether there might be a correlation between ADHD and skimming, I found this at the top of my search results.

Has anyone else noticed this? Does your medication help? I'm aiming at a 3.5+ GPA on graduation so I'm using the next month to resolve some of my habitual disorders and possibly get my GP to diagnose me and get a prescription.

Relevant context from the site:

&gt;""Speaking of ADHD, I was having a conversation with some friends the other day about skimming while reading. I skim all the time. Can't help it. It's the ADHD. When I hit a passage that bores me—usually large concrete setting details about this, that, or the other thing that only tangentially relates to the plot—I instantly skip down the page, skimming the paragraphs for keywords until I come upon where the story picks up again. In fact, when reviewing manuscripts for peers, I have to wrestle my attention to not do that. 

&gt;-

&gt;*What makes this an attention disorder is that the very nanosecond my mind becomes bored, it's off like a rocket looking for something else interesting to do. When reading books, I won't even be aware that I started skimming.*  

&gt;-

&gt;Neither of my friends skim, however. In fact, they seemed quite horrified that I do. They don't want to miss any key pieces of information, so they read it all. If a story is boring they'll stop reading it, but otherwise they take in every word the author put down. They also enjoy reading hard military science fiction. I'm not sure if there's a correlation there, but I'd rather have my attention span bludgeoned with a box of Windows Phone 7 phones than read that genre.""",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,1365262388.0,,,True,t3_1bsrnf,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1bsrnf/adhd_reading_skimming_a_splintered_mind/,

*Just wanted to remind people to *upvote this post*. Recently, our weekly threads get pushed off the page pretty quick. More upvotes = more wins = more people getting inspired (it is a cycle).*

##### Science behind Win Wednesday

* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.
 * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.
* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field.
 * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**
* **Soak in the positive events in your life**
 * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain.

***

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

**The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:**

* Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, no victory is truly a small one.
* Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at, progress is always a cause for celebration!
* Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!

***

* The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!
* **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!

I have been in this state for a while, maybe 2 to 3 months. I.feel.like.crap. And I don't know where I should go or what I should do. I am constantly feeling lost and empty. I am so worrying my future and cannot focus on my current tasks. 

I (24M) have been in university for five years, and I won't be graduating anytime soon(!). My uni life has been a total mess. My depression and ADHD are hindering me but the worst part is: I am starting to THINK that I am using ADHD as an excuse. 

-1st year  - BFF suicided, GF ran; It was in winter term. I hid myself and did not seek help. (stupid!)

-2nd year - Continued to struggle but had to face the reality: my grades were dropping hard. Finally saw school counsellor and psychiatrist --&gt; diagnosed with major depression.

-3rd year - decided to take a year off.  

-4th year - back to school. Things got better with some ups &amp; downs. Found out I have ADHD and started Concerta.  

-5th year (currently) - Fall term was great... 

But starting from around December (2012), I am losing my motivations. Last month was my 24yo bday. That night after all the partying stuff, I sat down and thought about my life for a second, and all I felt was fear, anger and shame. Most of my HS friends have graduated, some are in great career paths and life goals...stuff like that. I was well aware of that before but I have never felt the shame and sadness. It struck me. I almost cried that moment. I feel like I have failed the people that care about me and I don't want to continue, cuz I will just keep on failing. From that point, I think I lost the last bit of my willpower. I don't know what my future looks like. Everyone around me (in school especially) seems to be so motivated like they are beaming out sunlight, while I am stuck in a freaking dark corner. 
I miss that feeling when I actually *achieved* something, I miss it so bad.

[Guide],peri123,84,11,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/188cqr/tips_for_dealing_with_adhd_in_social_situations/,"Having ADHD can make it very difficult to hold conversations with people, and the fact that something like 1/3 of ADHD cases also have anxiety certainly doesn't help.

For ADHD specifically there are three areas in which I believe most ADHDers struggle in conversation:

* Impulsivity makes it very hard for us to wait our turn while someone is talking.  We also have a tendency to blurt things out that are totally unrelated to the conversation at hand.  Sometimes, these things are offensive.

* Inattentiveness makes us get distracted and even zone out during conversations that we don't find interesting.  This is bad because then you don't remember a word your friends said to you, and it may hurt their feelings if they were telling you a story or something and then asked you a question and you responded with, ""huh?""

* Hyperactivity can make you talk really fast, or talk a lot, and sometimes even cause us to stutter or stumble over words.

___

Impulsivity:

I like to treat this as a kind of game, or rather, as a competition with myself.  When something pops into your head that you just have to say, take one breath.  One breath.  Then do a quick mental checklist:

* Is this relevant to what they are saying?

* Am I interrupting the person I am talking to?

* Is this going to be even a little bit insulting to the person?

It's a conscious effort that takes time to master, but if you practice enough you will get pretty good at it.

____

Inattentiveness:

Another game-like solution!

* Try to picture them as being someone incredibly interesting.  Who do you wish you could talk to more than anybody else?  Pretend that the person talking to you is this person.

* Make a conscious effort to focus on the conversation.  Think of it like a competition: ""If I can focus on what this person is saying for the entire time, no matter how boring, I can reddit later!""  Literally, sit there and consciously listen to what they are saying.  Again, it takes practice, but you will get it if you work hard enough and don't give up on it.

____

Hyperactivity:

* Calm down.  Seriously, I know that when I get excited I talk fast, and loud, and a lot.  I stutter too, or slur words together, or change the subject about a million times.  The trick is to *calm down*.  When you start to feel really excited (or angry) take a breath and count to ten.  Now don't get all, ""stop being a freaking school councilor"" on me.  It works.  It really does.

* When you are talking consider how fast you are talking.  Again this is a *conscious effort*.  You have to work hard at it.  When you are talking to someone take a moment about halfway through and ask the following:

        How fast am I talking?

        How loud am I talking?

        Does the person I am talking to look exhausted? (happens)

Once you have gone over your mental checklist, how well does everything check out?  If you are doing any one of these things wrong, take a break and relax yourself.  Maybe even let the other person talk for a bit.

Well, I've been on Vyvanse 50mg for 6 months. My last doctors visit I was asked to submit to a drug test. I did think it was odd, but was assured by the nurse that its normal procedure with anyone prescribed  a controlled substance. 

 Yesterday I showed up to my doctors office for my refill script. The nurse asked be to step into the back office to discuss the results of the drug test. She then explains to me that I tested negative for everything, including amphetamine. She said that they can't take the chance of a patient selling their meds, and I will no longer be able to continue treatment with them.

  I was heated, I asked for a retest. Specifically a hair test. They refused. And said if I wanted to speak to the doctor, I need to make an appointment and wait to see him. At that point I just walked out. I got in my truck and the first thing I thought to do was call Shire. They explained to me it dose happen, and I should get in contact with the lab that did the test. 

 I called the lab, they refused to speak with me, and only the ordering doctor can inquire about results. Back to the doctors office I went..  

 I asked if the test was a ""zero tolerance"" test or if there was a cutoff.
Well come to find out, the cut off was 1000ng/ml. At this point I finally get to speak to the doctor. I explained to him that at this point, I don't even want to continue treatment with him, and I'm just trying to clear my name, and not be labeled a drug dealer. He seemed sympathetic, and told me the nurse was wont with trying to drop me so fast. He then calls the lab, hoping to get the actual numbers I tested. The lab claimed they don't have the number, only Neg/Pos results. 

After the phone call, he agreed with me that I could just be a fast metabolizer.  (Which i explained to him on my last visit. Telling him the Vyvanse seemed to wear off after about 5 hours) He switched me to 20mg Adderall 2x a day. But explained that I still need to submit to any future drug tests, and they will order for more sensitive testing next time.  

Since then, I've setup an appointment at a psychologist who specializes in ADHD. It'll be a month before my first visit. But afterward, I plan on stopping treatment with my GP doctor. 

Anyway, it seems like this happens a lot to some people. I just wanted to share what happened with me. If anyone has anything to add, feel free!

I have been reflecting back on these past nineteen years and can't help but feel like I missed out on life. I didn't know what ""normal"" felt like up until recently. Throughout the years my anxiety has worsened and my attention has deteriorated which has caused my friendships, and grades to suffer. The reason why I felt pushed to seek help was because my friend told me that I ""didn't have any regard"" for his feelings. Once I actually became medicated a month and a half ago, then I was able to realize that I missed out on these nineteen years. I am trying to imagine what life would have been like if I had this medication all along. Would I have learned proper social skills? Would I have made better grades? The questions just keep pouring in and I can't help but resent my parents because my dad and mom both have ADHD which they are medicated for. Maybe my ADHD was not noticeable since it was PI and I was not actively hyper all the time? I just feel like I missed out, but I am at least thankful that I found out and am able to actually excel now. Vyvanse has changed my life in the short amount of time I have been taking it! I can concentrate in class and have been making many friends and actually socializing. I joined the Pre-Law Society and have started pursuing the things I actually want to do instead of letting them pass me by. My real personality has started to come out and I have never felt happier in my whole entire life. Did anybody else feel this way right after their diagnosis?


EDIT: I am also passing all of my classes with A's and  B's now which is an improvement from the C's and D's from my previous semester. My grades are the main things that I am proud of too because I used to barely pass every class I enrolled in. I am also able to stay up for long periods of time because my anxiety is not controlling my life anymore. It used to make me tired and weak because I was always worrying about something.

I didn't expect this post to get so much attention.. Today has been such a roller coaster of emotions (nothing too new there... such a sensitive person). But thank you all so much :). You're all such amazing people with so much knowledge to share. I think I'll need to stick around.**  


I want to start by saying you folks have all been amazing, and I hope I don't every have to leave... but it looks like I might.

To summarize what my past 6 weeks have looked like:  

* Yet another person asked me if I have ADHD. I said I've never been diagnosed but will look into it. That brought me here.  

* I was blown away by your stories, which basically summarized my life and all of its struggles. I decided to see my doctor.  

* Doctor orders blood work, and sends in a referral to see a specialist.... 6 weeks go by.... Since I'm leaving for an overseas internship in September, the specialist can't see me... I go back to see my family doctor.



Now, today.
My doctor asks what's wrong, and holding back tears I answer: ""Life shouldn't be this difficult."" So, without getting any family background, any information on my current living situation, on my daily habits, she immediately grills me with questions about my depression.  
As I explain myself, I start going on another tangent (really nothing new for me), she yells at me because she ""doesn't care about other people's struggles and how you relate, I want to know about you.""... 
 
**WELL MAYBE THAT'S HOW I EXPLAIN MYSELF!! EVER THINK ABOUT THAT, YOU DUMB BITCH?!**  
 
Sorry....  

Any way, she let me say about 2 sentences as to why ADHD made sense to me, stopped me, and said my lack of motivation, my trouble concentration on paperwork, bills, and the mundane are because of a lack of motivation which are just symptoms of depression, and that I'm doing far too well in university to have ADHD, regardless of how much I procrastinate and put no effort into assignments, yet ace exams...

**So you're saying I have no motivation for some things, but tons for others, and that's still just regular old depression?!**  

I'm feeling so defeated. She didn't let me explain myself, and just shut down anything I wanted to say...   

Maybe it is only depression, and maybe I don't belong here after all...  

I haven't felt this shitty in quite some time.

**TL;DR:**  My doctor is a bitch who didn't let me get past ""I'm been struggling with depression for a long time,"" and yelled at me for going on tangents. Apparently I do too well in classes that I care about to have ADHD, regardless of how broken the rest of my life is.  



**Edit 1:** Formatting  
 
**Edit 2:** I forgot to mention: I've been a bad ent in the past, stopped, and restarted more recently. I don't toke very much, and hardly ever get past a [6], but apparently that's yet another reason why my doctor hates me... She felt the need to lecture me about how it will ""ruin my life"", regardless of how few times I enjoy dem trees, and what benefits they may bring.

I have no control over going into autopilot, and I don't notice that it's happened until it's far too late. This is most obvious when reading, where you know your eyes have looked over the text, but then you can't remember any of it.

One can click on the time to add tasks, and when the current time reached the task it would pop up a reminder (or could be set to do 10 min beforehand etc).  each task could be color coded by importance. One could zoom out on the timeline to see how much of time is accounted for.  Maybe a check box to let program know task was accomplished.

In addition, there could be a summary function which gives a breakdown of time spend during the day. Maybe even random pop ups which ask you what you are currently doing when nothing is scheduled?

I know this would help me keep track of tasks, and aware of time. Basically make up for poor executive function. It would also help maintain a proper sleep schedule.

*Just wanted to remind people to **upvote this post**. Recently, our weekly threads get pushed off the page pretty quick. More upvotes = more wins = more people getting inspired (it is a cycle).*

#####Science behind Win Wednesday (new)

* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.
  * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.

* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field. 
  * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**
  * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain. 

*I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good, let me know if you want more info.*

***

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***

* **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**

* **Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!** 

* **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**

***
* The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!

* **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!

##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS: (updated 5/21) **FRESH**

* After the worst semester of my crap college career I'm still, finally, graduating.
* This week I convinced an ADHD denier (some one who does not think ADHD is real) that ADHD is real. I also got an A+ for my interview with the town's mayor.
* I applied for TWO jobs! Count 'em! TWO!
* Despite really not wanting to, I forced myself out of bed this morning and to work. I think I've managed not to take a sick day in over 2 months.
* I have just recently received my offer of admission! This will be my third time trying, but this time with a diagnosis, medication, and doing therapy.
* With the current exception of bedding, toiletries, and a few other things that always need to be packed up at the last minute, I've packed my entire dorm room up for moving completely by myself.
* taught my dog a new behavior
* This morning I made my bed.
* I convinced my self to go to the library and study. The most difficult part was getting out of bed.
* Besides that, I managed to only call out of work one day in the five months I worked there. That is a fucking world record for me.
* Approximately five weeks ago I picked up the KSS habit again, and I've had four increasingly successful weeks to report in WW!
* Many many more!

Our brains are video games that we are constantly playing. Meditation is putting down the controller and looking away for a few seconds. 
Even just a few seconds a day, will make a huge difference in how you feel. 


Find a comfortable spot. Sit or lay down, makes no difference. 
Deep breath in through the nose, exhale. Repeat at comfortable pace.


Now, watch your thoughts. That's all it is. Just watching. You are meditating.


Here’s where it gets tricky, don’t participate in your thoughts.


The difference between watching and participating:
Thoughts:
“I am sitting here like a jackass trying to meditate and I don’t even think I am doing this right. Does this shit actually work or not? Am I too stupid to get this? I have other things I could be doing like homework, laundry, calling that girl. If I called her what would be my excuse? What if I told her that I needed to borrow that book...”


The thoughts are the first three sentences, in this case the questions.


The participation in those thoughts or the fantasy, is what you could be doing instead of sitting on your ass meditating. This is your brain picking up the controller and playing the game. 


Adjust your mind to just watch your thoughts like a video. Be entertained or horrified, but do not follow them down the rabbit hole. Do not judge your thoughts. You are not creating them, they just pop up of their own accord.


You will inevitably get frustrated because you won’t be able to resist the fantasies. When this happens, put down the controller and bring your awareness back to watching your thoughts. Breath. Relax. 


When you bring your awareness back to watching, congratulate yourself. You just did your first mental push-up. You are now on your way to sculpting that flabby brain into a lean mean calming machine. 


Every time you meditate, or even just attempt to (15 minutes or less is fine), you are strengthening your brain. It takes a shit ton of practice and is hard as hell. But the calming effects are extraordinary. That is why there are Buddhist monasteries full of shaven headed monks who look like badasses - because they are some of the strongest people on this planet. You just can’t tell from the outside. 


If this is helpful in any way let me know. I was thinking of doing a series of bad metaphors on how to meditate. ",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,1364258085.0,,,True,t3_1azc3q,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1azc3q/do_you_need_help_with_learning_how_to_meditate/,

This is the word that has always been attributed to me. I talk fast, I think fast, I move fast. I am speedy, I am hyper, I am ADHD, I am smart.

Because I think so quickly, my conversations go like this.

Them: ""I think so, they're shy and-""
Me: ""-live in Africa, yeah.""

Ironically, I work in a call center and am consistently trained on pacing, tone, waiting 3 beats to start talking- and I'm awesome at my job. Obviously my friends know this trait and are okay with it- there is an unspoken rule that they can and do interrupt me at any time as well- but I want to break this obnoxious habit.

But of course before they can say ""that's not what I was going to say"" I'm off on a tangent about sombreros and the philosophy of maple syrup or some bullshit.

The only way I can get anything done is to do one thing at a time.  I cannot split my attention across tasks, and it seems that I can hardly feel more than one emotion at a time too.  

For instance, I normally feel lots of love and affection for my girlfriend, but if we're having an argument where I feel like I'm under fire, or she is being incessantly needy or questioning my loyalty, I tend not to be able to feel that love for her in the moment.  If I stop and allow myself a moment to reflect on what I feel towards her in that moment I mainly just have a memory of the way I felt before the argument--when I'm upset with her the love I have for her seems to go away almost entirely.  This can make it really hard for me to feel like I want to reconcile with her and I think it changes my argument style to cause me to say things that are hurtful and don't reflect the the entirety of how I feel about her, just the way I felt about her in that moment.  After some time has passed after the conflict (usually a day or so), even if it is not resolved I will not be so angry anymore and will then realize that I've said some things that aren't reflective of what I really feel about her.  It's as if my perspective has totally changed, and all the love and affection I normally feel for her has returned with pretty much the same intensity as before.

I've always considered this to be normal, or at least I thought it was.  I've talked about this with her and she says that she's not this way at all.  She says that even when she's upset with me that she still feels how much she loves me.  Like most people, I only have my own experience to draw upon.  And so I ask you /r/ADHD, do you feel yourself to be monoemotional, to be unable to experience anything but the strongest emotion you are feeling in the moment to the exclusion of almost all others?  Is this an ADHD thing?  Or is it unique to me?  I feel like it might be an ADHD thing, since processing many emotions can be kind of overwhelming.

I know most of you are students, but file this away for the future. Housekeeping is an enormous, insurmountable obstacle for ADHD people.

My solution, as succinctly as possible:

1) Make a list of every task that needs to be done in the house, ever.

2) Group tasks by Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Annually.

3) Start an electronic calendar. I use Google Calendar because it syncs with my phone, computer, and iPad.

4) Daily tasks obviously need to be done daily. Add them to the calendar if you need to and cross them off the list.

5) Weekly tasks - tricky. Put a lot of thought into your regular schedule and which days would be simplest to do which tasks. Add these tasks to the calendar with a ""Repeat Forever"" option.

6) Continue with the Monthly, Quarterly, Annual, etc. tasks.

This process takes some time and tinkering, but... when it is done, it's a miracle.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
We all know that we are going to flake at some point. This system prevents you from ever becoming overwhelmed, because you know you can leap back in at any time.

The house is a nasty pigsty? Bummer. Today is ""dusting and surfaces"" day, so start there. Then watch TV.

Tomorrow is ""Glass and toilets"" day. Work that in at some point.

**At any time, no matter how bad it is, you can have your house passably clean within a week. And you will never, ever feel overwhelmed about it.**
______________________________________________________________________________________________
Have guests coming tomorrow? That's called Crisis Cleaning. The trick to that is:

A) Prioritize what *actually* needs to be done, rather than perfection.

B) Focus on one task at a time.

C) Take regular, generous breaks. Set the kitchen timer to remind you when it is time to get back to work.

I have many more thoughts on this, feel free to ask. I've been honing this for a year or so. I hope it can help a few others.

Edit: A resource lots of people use is www.flylady.net. You may find some good tips there. It was too much for my ADHD brain, I found it scattered and confusing. This works much better for me.

I just wanted to cent about how the hyperactivity aspect of ADHD absolutely bothers me to no end.

My mother has ADD, and I was diagnosed at 10 or so, I don't know if it's hereditary or not,
But throughout my life, I wasn't an overly hyper little child,
Sure I still couldn't focus for a damn, and my memory last as long as the last thing I'm told, but I didn't have a problem chilling out,

And yet, when I say anything, people automatically begin to associate the hyperactivity, small comments about how when I'm simply excited about something, people will say ""my ADHD is acting up""

Or when people assume that my attention needs to be so outlandishly small. I despise those shirts at hot topic tht say ""I don't have ADHD, I just-oh look a squarrel""

I get distracted by the squarrel, but I don't need to cut off mid sentence to announce it,

I'm sick of people assuming that it's all one thing,

And of course the false diagnosis,
When parents have a lazy or bratty child, and they blame him having ADHD, when many times they don't. It's not a scape goat for an excuse for a lazy child.

And then there's those people who think its funny to ""have"" it.
Compare to ""omg, I'm like so OCD sometimes""

I don't like that either.

I feel that people with ADHD are being discriminated against. Many students do not have health insurance, so their only access to healthcare is through the university. These students don't have the money to see a doctor at a private practice. And why should they have to?

I haven't looked into this very far yet, but I feel very strongly about it and I want the letter to go to the right place and I want it to be persuasive and accurate. Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to start, or what I should write, etc? Better yet, does anyone have a counterargument to bring up?

**TL;DR:** My school won't diagnose or treat ADHD. I feel this is discrimination against people with the disorder, so I'm going to write them a letter asking them to change their policy. Any thoughts?

**EDIT:** I should clarify a couple of things: 

1) I already have a diagnosis and am being treated. I had originally tried to do this through the health center, but was denied. I had to wait a long time until I could go home, six hours away, during winter break and see my psychiatrist. My insurance provider only operates in certain regions.

2) My university does provide accommodations for people with disabilities, ADHD included. As a student with ADHD, I can take tests in a separate location and have priority registration, among other things. It's the health center, a separate entity, that does not provide diagnoses or medication for ADHD even though it does so for other psychiatric conditions.

**Also**, thanks for all of your responses! I'm sorry I can't provide better answers for those of you who are just as curious as I am about the situation. I posted this so I could get your advice and opinions before I launched into research and then writing a letter.

The first session was mostly self-introductions of group members, asking questions and general discussion.  As we recognized our own experiences in others’ stories, there was laughter and a more relaxed conversational atmosphere.  Some members have other physical or psychological issues or disabilities as well.  People have lost jobs, relationships, friends, and family over ADHD issues.  Several have struggled with severe (self-described, not clinical) bouts of depression or anxiety, where in others comorbidities were diagnosed and treated.

#### *Tip:*  Make/update a daily To Do list before you get ready for bed, so you *know* you have a plan, but still have time to unwind and not worry as you’re falling asleep.
#### *Twist:* Knowing you *must* finish aim for at least 75% completion of your list, be mindful of not over-committing yourself.  Or break your tasks into attainable steps -- each smaller step is thus easier to complete!

***

# **Take-Home Exercise (THE)**  

##### I. What feeling or combination of feelings are you experiencing about your diagnosis?
#*An example:*  
1. “I feel FRUSTRATION that my ADHD was *recognized* as a child (and I knew I had it) but I wasn’t formally diagnosed -- I think I would have avoided so much self-doubt, fear, and pain if I’d known the issues were from ADHD, and not *me*.”

2. “I feel RELIEF knowing other ‘problems’ are ADHD, that there are others out there who share the issues, and that there are treatment/adaptation possibilities.”  

3. “I feel HOPE that I may be able to manage this better, that I can learn not to let the ‘ADHD-things’ go and not internalize the blame for not ‘measuring up’ to some arbitrary mark.”

##### II.  What are the reasons you decided to come for treatment now?

# (This could be CBT or any/all ADHD treatment.)  

##### III.  Contemplating making a change in your life can feel risky; Check those that apply, and add any others:

## *Possible Pros:*  

____ Less depression, increased optimism.  
____ Feelings of being “in charge”.  
____ Positive feedback from others.  
____ Enhanced self-esteem and self-efficacy.  

## *Possible Cons:*
____ Overwhelming.  
____ Fear it won’t work, and I’ll have wasted so much time and effort *again*.  
____ Risky/unknown.  
____ Not comfortable.  
____ Fear of failing yet again.  
____ Uncertainty about how others will react.  

##### IV.  Dealing with old hurts/angers/addressing the past.
1. What was the hardest thing for you about having ADHD as a child?

2. What would you say to help a child with ADHD?

3. What would you say to your best friend if he or she had ADHD (as an adult)?

##### V. Identifying Strengths/Internal Resources
1. What positive qualities have you developed as a result of struggling with ADHD?

My parents came with me, they had their doubts. They were thinking the things many parents with potential ADHD children think: ""My child can sit still and focus on video games for hours, they can't have 'Attention Deficit'"" The psychiatrist was the first person that we really talked to about this.

He shared with us a packet of information, it detailed how many people with ADHD (especially the ""Primarily Inattentive"" type) had a difference in learning style/motivation center/brain whatever you want to call it. The article said most people do things because they are important, they write the essays and do the homework because they know that they need to do it for school, work, etc. But, people with ADHD have an inability to prioritize tasks based on ""importance"" they prioritize tasks based on their intrest in them. 

It also means that as an ""interest-based"" person I struggle less with homework and class work in subjects I find interesting. I can sit in math class and take notes and follow along with the teacher for an hour and a half, but in chemistry i can't stay on task for 30 seconds.

This article (and unfortunately/obviously I can't find it) helped me and my parents understand a little more about ADHD. It really brought my parents from ""He's so smart but he doesn't try,"" and ""He doesn't run all over the place so he can't be ADHD,"" and ""He has gotten good grades for so long,"" to ""My son learns and prioritizes things differently, what can we do to help?"" 

I have forgotten a lot of what I wanted to say, and this is getting pretty long so if there is anything I can clarify don't hesitate to ask. 

**TL;DR: ADHD people learn different, importance of task plays small role in when the task gets done.**

The only problem has been paying for the prescription, as I don't have insurance.  There are co-pay cards out there that you might be aware of, but they are a dirty trick.  Co-pay cards only exist for newer, SUPER expensive drugs to make them cost the same amount as Adderall out of pocket.  You're still looking at 100+ dollars for a month supply.

Anyway, so I did some poking around and I came across this
http://www.shire.com/shireplc/en/contactus/patientassistance

The Shire Cares Assistance Program.  What you have to do is fill the application out, have your doctor fill out a portion, and send it to them.  Since I'm currently unemployed I had to attach a ""Letter of No Income"" stating that I've been unemployed for long enough that my pay stubs are no longer relevant and that I currently have no way to pay for medication.  I told them about my situation and why I thought Shire could help.

After my doc filled out her portion she faxed it off (make a fax cover letter to make it easy on 'em) and four days later it got approved. Now Shire is going to pay for 12 prescription refills of 30mg Vyvanse.  It's good for 12 30 day refills that I can fill ever 22 days, but used appropriately it will last all year.

I just thought I would share since I know medication costs can be a real burden for those with no insurance or shitty insurance.  Talk to your doctor about Vyvanse, or if you're already on Vyvanse, check it out.  It's been a huge weight off my shoulders!

**TLDR** If you have bad or no insurance check out the link to Shire Care Assistance, it is a very quick and painless process that can pay for your ADHD meds if you fall into the proper income bracket.

#####Science behind Win Wednesday

* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.
  * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.

* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field. 
  * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**
  * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain. 

*I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good, let me know if you want more info.*

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***

* **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**

* **Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!** 

* **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**

***
* The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!

* **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!

ADHD share many symptoms with depression/anxiety and it is impossible for us to tell you if you have ADHD or not. If you think you have a good chance about having ADHD you might want to take an online survey to verify you should begin the diagnosis process (Psychcentral ADHD test)(http://psychcentral.com/addquiz.htm), contact a psychologist or professional, and ask for an ""ADHD evaluation"". **We will remove threads on this topic!**

2. **Wiki and search** - We have a [FAQ wiki](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/ADHD) (which you can help add to!) please view this before posting! Also the subreddit search on Reddit for /r/ADHD works well! We have lots and lots of great discussions in the past. **Please search before posting!** The FAQ is still being migrated...we are working on it! **Also be sure to read the rules/guidelines in the sidebar!**

3. We have 3 weekly threads on Sunday, Wednesday and Friday. **Kick-start Sunday** helps you plan your week and think ahead. **Win Wednesday** allows you to acknowledge your positive wins for the week and celebrate others. **Freely Ask Question Friday** is the place to introduce yourself or ask a random question (to keep quality of posts up). These threads are **open for responses all week** and we appreciate **extra upvotes**! We have been doing these threads every week for months and they have lost their 'shinyness' but upvotes = more views!

4. We do not allow talk about recreational drug use or off-label usage (taking more than prescribed) and how to obtain these illicitly. We will allow a thread on self-medication occasionally, but it is best to check with the mods. I understand many people with ADHD do drugs, but that should not be discussed here. You can search for threads we have talked about marijuana in the past.

5. We merged with /r/ADD back during SOPA and had **1000 members** back then. 12 months later we hit 10,500!

6. We have an IRC chat room! The link is always on the sidebar but here is a [link](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/ADHD) 

7. /r/ADHD has a **[fitocracy group](https://www.fitocracy.com/group/11363/)** and a **[steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ADHDreddit)/r/ADHD Hyperfocused Gamers**! *To join the steam group send a friend invite to ""/r/ADHD Santa""*.

8. **Win Wednesday** has been going for 36 weeks. Every week. Hats off to the moderators for keeping up with the consistent weekly posts (seems like anything consistent is hard with ADHD).

9. **Expert AMA's** - I will start doing expert AMA's in /r/ADHD within the month. We will start with Ari Tuckman and Gina Pera. Getting answers from the community is great, but we have heard the calls for more authoritative answers!

10. **Our community is awesome** - I am biased, but this is a super-amazing positive subreddit! We support and cheer each other on. If you see a comment or thread which violates the rules/guidelines don't just downvote...report too!

11. **Related subreddits** - We have created a subreddit for pictures and ADHD meme's. **/r/ADHDmeme**. I admit, this has languished a bit...but if anyone wants to help moderate and build the subreddit let me know! Also **/r/ADHDbuddies** is a new one where we set people up to be ADHD buddies to help accountability.

* We jumped from #1003 to #910 in biggest subreddits in a week (ahead of /r/zen /r/pizza and /r/texas!)
* We had 1432 new subscribers this week which ranks #144 in total new subscribers! Mostly due to bananaking's post but also back to school/new year.
* 15.83% growth in subscribers this week puts us at #41. That is a sizeable percentage for an already established subreddit!
* Current activity rank #475 (not sure what is used to calculate this...)

1368250203.0,61,self.ADHD,1e46e8,Real Talk: How many of you question whether or not you may be using ADHD as a scapegoat?,RiskyTrizkit,70,9,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1e46e8/real_talk_how_many_of_you_question_whether_or_not/,"For a while I didn't even believe in ADHD, much less think I had it.

I thought it was a disorder invented by the pharmaceutical industry to make more money. At this point, who would put it past them?

But then I read a bit more about ADHD and its specifics, and related to literally *everything*. I forget things, I am a klutz, I daydream, I talk loud when I shouldn't, I interrupt others during conversations, I lose my keys and wallet on a daily basis, When I close my eyes, my thoughts seem to come across like a flurry of static. I can't even concentrate enough to do things I like doing.

---

So I read all these articles about people who had all the same problems and thought: ""Holy shit, I have ADHD. Time to finally nail this thing and start living.""

Before I went out to get meds I had a series of long thoughts though:

Perhaps I forget things as a coping mechanism that allows me to avoid the anxiety of dealing with them. Perhaps I daydream because I crave the escapism. Maybe interrupting is the result of never getting a word in before my parents as a kid. Maybe the static in my head and concentration issues are just a result from the seizure medicine I am on? Maybe I am depressed, and thats why the books I read or the drawings I start go unfinished?

---

Or maybe its ADHD.

 I was diagnosed by two psych professionals and the better half of the ADHD Internet community and everyone agreed that I had it. I want to believe I have it, and ultimately I think I do. Its hard to say how much is from ADHD and how much is from the Seizure Medicine however. 

Wow, I feel like I got pretty sidetracked here. I guess my point is: Sometimes I feel like I blame all the shit on ADHD so I can explain my current situation a bit better. The things that happen to me fit perfectly within the boundaries of ADHD, but it still pulls on some cords for me to 'blame it on the dog.' (Sure he ate the chemistry homework, but did he really eat the calculus homework too?)

I can compile the responses in this post and we can all have a chuckle at our absent-mindedness.

I'll start

1. See things that are theirs in places they shouldn't be (IE shoes on the stairs, hair ties on the ground in bathrooms, magazines on the floor in front of the house) and completely ignore them repeatedly every time they are passed. Often they don't get picked up until someone ELSE comes and says ""Hey, this is yours, are you gonna take it?"" and often your response is ""Meh, just leave it over here."" and continue to ignore it some more.

2. Forget to take your medication for ADHD repeatedly, or go through large spans of time where you forget to schedule appointments with your psych/therapist until you're either out of medicine or are going through a mini-crisis

3. Root for the wrong team at the sports event because you forgot which side of the field they are on and aren't paying attention to their jerseys. 

4. Falling for a significant other quickly and on the other side of the spectrum, not having interest in romantic feelings for a long period of time

5. Not being able to empathize unless having a direct visual or auditory stimuli of the event, or on the other hand, not being unable to empathize with something which contradicts your own views/opinions/perception of the matter 

6. While on OR off medication, craving substances/vices (IE Cigarettes, Weed, Coffee)

7. Not being able to maintain eye contact; finding it easier to talk to others when not looking at them

8. In social situations, having the tendency to blurt out your thoughts without regard to how they fit in the conversation

9. When having a conversation, jumping from topic to topic due to a train of thought when they don't seem to relate at all

10. A lack of drive to do things which are required but also perceived as ""a waste of time"" 

11. Having lots of ideas very suddenly, obsessing over a new idea, only later to completely forget about it and not care anymore

12. Having a thought, but immediately forgetting what it was. 

13. Writing Walls-o-text to get your point across but refusing to read other walls-o-text :P

14. Defiance of order and rules

15. Over analyzing EVERYTHING

16. Doing something quirky to snap someone out of their auto-pilot or to make others think

17. In the midst of not saying anything, blurting something out thats completely random. Other people look at you like, O.o

18. Having to re-read paragraphs multiple times due to skipping ahead/not really reading; having to read slowly and carefully to retain information

19. Mind wandering while reading/doing other things

20. Spending too much time in the bathroom, due to imagination

21. CANNOT for the love of god pay attention in class. 

23. When they were younger/children, combat boredom by playing with normal items (ie, pencils, erasers, etc) and imagining a different situation; or just have a very vivid imagination that would make it difficult to pay attention 

24. Blackout during a conversation; completely stop paying attention and zone out

25. Walk away in the middle of a conversation because you got distracted by something

26. Start getting ready for something (IE, going to bed) then forget you are getting ready for something and waste time/let a lot of time pass before doing what actually had to get done

27. Being hungry but no motivation to prepare food or get any

28. Rambling on because you forgot what point you were going to make

29. Lack of motivation to do fun hobbies!

SO!  as I am considering the types of content to get from them, questions to ask, issues to bring up as they write content for this resource, I come to you!   What sort of info would you find helpful?  Dr. Gazic, our child psychiatrist is HUGELY focused on ADHD, and LOVES all of the stuff I share with him from here.  He also really enjoys the questions that can come up.. so shoot!

I often see things about ""what is your experience with this medication"" or ""I was just diagnosed, what should I expect?""  What medications would you like to know about? what sort of interactions?    

TL:DR What should I make these specialists write about that would actually be more helpful than the typical WEBMD BS writing?

I've been ADHD all of my life, but I always just fell into the ""you're just lazy/not applying yourself/etc"" trap set by all of the adult and authority figures in my life.

Last June I turned 30 and had floated from low-paid uninteresting office job to low-paid uninteresting office job, with some retail thrown in for good measure. My gigs usually lasted about 6 months before I either quit or was fired. My current job I've been in for a while now, but that's only because I'm union and hard to fire (I assume). I was depressed, I drank, I was so emotionally closed down that I couldn't have normal romantic relationships.

I reached a point earlier this year where it was clear the higher-ups at my office were building a case to fire me and I was hitting rock bottom. I started trying to figure out wtf was wrong with me and the more I read about ADHD the more ""oh wow, that's me"" moments I had. I broke down and made my very first mental health appointment ever, and met with a therapist and a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed as ADHD and started on medication (first concerta, now adderall).

It's been a long road since then, but I can't deny that my life is different now and will soon be drastically different. I now have an amazing girlfriend who I can actually connect emotionally with and who understands me completely (she suffers from the same things I do) and I have spent the last 8 months or so learning a new skill which I was able to parlay into an amazing new job opportunity.

Prior to treatment I was the lowest paid admin assistant in my office, doing typical shitty grunt work. I can't complain too much about the pay, I'm sure it was more than some and I was able to survive on it. My salary was around $36,000/year.

Over the past year I was able to train myself in a new skill and force my way into a position to gain experience. Today, I accepted a job offer for an amazing opportunity that utilizes my new skills and involves things I love; something I can be proud and happy to be doing, rather than the low level positions I've had in the past. My soon-to-be new salary is $74,000/year.

I'm genuinely proud of myself and what I've been able to accomplish this year, after getting my ADHD relatively under control. I still struggle with it and with depression, and there are always horrible days to go with the good, but I finally feel like I have my life under control.

It allows you to set a limit to the amount of time you get to spend on certain websites. It makes you more aware of how much useless minutes you spend checking your newsfeed or sifting through reddit. I've had it for one day and it already made me feel more productive by the end of it.

I've had clinical depression since the age of 17, then developed anxiety about five years ago. I sought a diagnosis after reading an article about ADHD that hit (uncomfortably) close to home, and was diagnosed with ADHD-PI. I'm currently taking 10mg of Adderall IR three times daily.  

I've started noticing something lately, and I can't tell if it's because of the ADD or if I'm just lazy - just trying to see if this rings true with others. I've always been called ""talented"" - I was in gifted and talented classes throughout elementary and middle school, was a somewhat decent artist, took a deep interest in learning French/studying sociology in both high school and college, and have played countless musical instruments over the years. But stepping back, I've noticed that I'm simply *okay* at all of these things. I've never really stuck out an interest long enough to really be good at something, or to excel in school (after eight years of undergrad, I got bored with majors and routinely changed them, then simply stopped going to school.) I hate practicing anything, and almost feel like there should be immediate gratification instead of repetition. So here I am, at the age of 33, trying to figure out what I'm interested in... and possibly good at. This is honestly the hardest part I've encountered since my diagnosis.

I thought there was something wrong with me. I constantly felt that I must be lazy, or not ambitious enough, or that I just needed to try harder. Since my diagnosis I have come to understand that while it is something I struggle with, I will not let it control my life. Between my medication and my behavioral therapist I have gained a lot of ground.

In my effort to bring order and balance into my life I began looking for apps that I could use to organize my day. I have tried many, many different apps and finally narrowed it down to five apps that I use on a daily basis.I know how difficult dealing with ADHD can be and since these apps have helped me so much, I wanted to share them with you guys. 

1. Astrid Tasks - By far the best task-oriented app I have ever used. Favorite features: Allows you to share tasks via email or username (if they also use Astrid). Notifies you when tasks you have assigned have been completed and allows both parties to comment on tasks. Notifies you when a task is due and will not clear the notification until you either complete the task or snooze it. The notifications can be annoying, but it doesn't let you ignore your tasks-- which is important for people with ADHD.

2. Routinely - Routinely is an app for your daily routines (medications, exercise etc.) Favorite Features: Simply click ""today"" and it marks your routine off. Also, it lets you see how many times that month you accomplished or missed your routine and also has a graph feature as well. Routinely also has a widget feature that shows you how many routines are left for the day.

3. Mindjet - I have spent my entire life making lists. One of the things I have struggled with is my mind's inability to focus and tendency to jump all over the place. Enter Mindjet! Mindjet is a mind mapping app and quite possibly my favorite of all the apps I use. It lets my mind jump around and organize my thoughts. I can go back and forth between different subtopics and I don’t even have to worry about running out of room on my paper or ending up with a list that is virtually unreadable.

4. Evernote - I just downloaded this app and I don’t have a lot of experience with it, but if the entire app is as good as the little I've played around with, I know I will love it. The basic premise of Evernote is that it allows you to organize all your notes in one place. You can then access them from your computer and/or any other device you have downloaded the application on. Evernote lets you make written notes of your ideas, to-do’s, meetings etc. You can also store images of receipts or business cards, and even save audio notes! I was especially excited about the audio notes! Sometimes it’s so much easier to be able to think aloud and record my thoughts when my mind feels like it is going 100mph.

5. Mobile Banking App - I could  recommend my mobile banking app, but since not many people use my bank, I doubt it will help. However, if your bank does have a mobile application I suggest downloading it. I struggle with financial responsibility and having access to that information at the touch of my fingers has helped me regain control. Mint is a budget management and good for people whose banks do not have an app.  

All of these applications are free, although I believe Astrid, at least, has a premium version that includes widgets you can add to your home screen. If you have adult ADD and find yourself unable to organize your responsibilities, then download and try these applications. I hope they help and give you some piece of mind. Good luck!

*Just wanted to remind people to **upvote this post**. Recently, our weekly threads get pushed off the page pretty quick. More upvotes = more wins = more people getting inspired (it is a cycle).*

#####Science behind Win Wednesday (new)

* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.
  * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.

* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field. 
  * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**
  * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain. 

*I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good, let me know if you want more info.*

***

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***

* **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**

* **Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!** 

* **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**

***

##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS: (updated 5/28) **FRESH**

* I graduated college!  YEAH!!!
* I paid off my credit card.
* FINALLY hung my custom mirror that's been gathering dust in the hallway for about a month.
* Finished some more group projects ahead of schedule so I'm not the one everyone is waiting on.
* Today I realized I was the common denominator in many bad relationships that are most important to me. I told my loved ones this and started a new chapter today. Feels good.
* So far, I've managed to make $90 doing different repair work. This is a pretty big deal for me, my ADHD is bad enough that I'm on disability
* I had my highest GPA ever.[1]   with my most difficult courses ever
* Got my blood work done, got stuff needed for other medical testing, and I set up an appointment with a woman's counselor to add to the therapy I am already doing
* I'm late but I finally stopped talking about auditioning for a play at my local theater and did it! 
* I got engaged. :)
* I think I have finally identified a definable improvement of my meds.
* Many many more!

1357423512.0,58,self.ADHD,160zql,A psychiatrist said I can't have ADHD because I was high school valedictorian. ,,67,9,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/160zql/a_psychiatrist_said_i_cant_have_adhd_because_i/,"I went to a boarding school since I was 12 so my parents really couldn't observe my ""studying"" habits. It never occurred to me that I could have ADHD until my best friend started suggesting I see a psychiatrist. Her brother has ADHD and she started to see traits in me.  Looking back, starting in the 6th grade I would doze off during instruction and I would always turn to one of my friends and ask him what the hell are we suppose to do. Most of the time he would do it for me. Actually, he let me copy often. However, I did learn this way. This continued throughout school. I would learn by cheating. I was also loved by staff so I got away with a lot (late assignments).I graduated top of the class not really feeling badass about it. Though I learned a lot and my near perfect score tests were done by me only, I didn't learn in a way that is considered ""the usual way"". 

Then I started college. I failed miserably. Everything went in one ear and out the other and I had no friend to turn to. I procrastinated like I had all year. Though I'm a really good reader, I would fall behind on reading assignments simply cause I wasn't interested or thought I could do it later. A lot times I would waste time and not even realize what I was doing. There were other traits as well but my attention span and lack of motivation is what affected me the most school wise. So I finally went to see a ""professional"", who ended up telling me I can't have ADHD because I was high school valedictorian. I thought it was a stereotypical statement thinking I was a hardcore dedicated study worm who had it easy and it made me quite upset she would jump to such a assumption.  I know I should see another psychiatrist but should I include being valedictorian next time? I feel like I have play stupid in order to get help :( 

Edit: I believe my college classes are fairly ""easy"". I have no problem in my major's classes because I'm actually interested in them. Yet, with others I am barely getting by (in my 3rd semester) mostly due to late and missing papers. But the ones I do have turned in have decent/high grades. I want do well. I REALLY do.

EDIT: All of them compiled into a playlist by Redditor computerpsych:
http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL558B3975FC49C01C

**EDIT: Even though i agree with everything Dr. Barkley says, viewer discretion is advised. I personally do not think that ADHD has only downside and I don't think he does either. But you have to understand that first of all, he is a doctor and a researcher and that is the attitude in which he approaches ADHD, he knows what he needs to say in order to get the support and funding to help ADHD people.The problem is not that ADHD is not anything more than just a set of disorders, the problem is that it is perceived to be so in today's educational, social and occupational system, where the upsides of ADHD overlooked and disregarded.** 

For example :

* majority of the population are early birds whereas ADHD people are usually night owls 

* majority of the population can focus on and do well what they *need*, ADHD people can only focus on and do well what they *like*, but if they are enabled to do so, they are really, really good at it

* normal brain can only focus on what is the actual issue at the given moment, ADHD brain tends to process multiple information at once

And many more...

The thing is that ADHD is not that much of a *serious disorder*, the thing is that it is manufactured that way by simple fucked up - one-way system focused on as much regularity as possible, stomping individuality and creativity, to better understand this, **i highly recommend you guys to go watch these videos, they are essential for understanding of what ADHD people need from education**:

1370713207.0,53,self.ADHD,1fxoh2,Central Auditory Processing Disorder,AmazingGraced,61,8,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1fxoh2/central_auditory_processing_disorder/,"I was diagnosed with ADHD a year ago, but have dealt with the affects of ADHD all my life.  I had a full CAPD evaluation last week and it was a tremendous relief to hear their findings.  For years, I have told audiologists that I don't hear as well out of my left ear as I do my right, yet test after test has proven that I hear equally well about of both ears.  I actually have perfect hearing.  Yet my experience is much different.  So what gives?  

Well CAPD evaluation looks at how well my brain processes sound.  Lo and behold, sounds heard through my left ear aren't processed nearly as efficiently by my brain as the sounds I hear from my right ear.  The different hearing capabilities between the ears was dramatic and proved that I have to focus harder and concentrate longer to understand what I am hearing through my left ear compared to the far more efficient right side.  

Even worse, is that because the left ear's capacity is diminished, my brain can not discern the difference between background noises or voices, giving one priority over the other. I hear each as though they were all the same level of sound.  A tick tock clock, which I feel is the most maddening sound in the world, sounds as loud as someone speaking to me and I have trouble directing my attention to one over the other. I can do it, but it takes tremendous effort, which is ultimately far more draining than a simple interaction needs to be. 

One test put me in between two speakers, one in front and one behind.  The speaker behind simulated the background noise of 20 non speaking adults, much like the experience of sitting in a classroom.  Meanwhile 1 individual spoke through the speaker in front of me.  I was suppose to repeat what I heard and the amount of effort it took for me to try and discern the words was frustrating.  I realized how listening feels like constantly running after a missed bus, hoping to catch up to all those sitting comfortably on it, engaged in the conversation.  I use context and hope what I am hearing is what is being conveyed and do my best to keep up.  I have perfect hearing and yet I can't always understand what is being said.  Kind of wild, no?  

After struggling to do my very best and make sense of what I was hearing, at certain intervals I would find my mind drifting, simply because I just couldn't focus any longer.  I was tired and bored.  I have always felt neglectful when I couldn't seem invested in what others were saying, feeling as if I wasn't considerate or caring enough to really listen to them, when maybe it wasn't simply disinterest but actual disability.  I want to hear them, but if I can't hear them clearly, what else is my mind suppose to do  and for how long can it attempt to do that?

This particular audiology practice recommends patients with CAPD wear a filter in their subordinate ear, which essentially reduces the capacity of what that ear can hear, so that ear doesn't need to process unnecessary sounds.  This gives me more energy and attention to direct to the dominant ear's capacity to process sound, making that effort to hear, thus listen, far more efficient.  A mold of my ear was made and I should receive the filter in a few weeks.  

I am so excited to see what, if any benefit, this will have in my day to day experience.  Once I have the filter and have tried it in various settings, I promise to return and share my experience. 

For those looking for more information, start with this audiology practice.  They are the only group in the world at this time who have created their proprietary filter to aid those affected with CAPD.

##### WIN WEDNESDAY!!!

*Just wanted to remind people to **upvote this post**. ~~Recently, our weekly threads get pushed off the page pretty quick.~~ *Not true anymore. /r/ADHD is awesome.** More upvotes = more wins = more people getting inspired (it is a cycle).*

#####Science behind Win Wednesday (new)

* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.
  * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.

* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field. 
  * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**
  * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain. 

*I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good, let me know if you want more info.*

***

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***

* **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**

* **Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!** 

* **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**

***
* The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!

* **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!

1351643980.0,57,self.ADHD,12ddkm,An analogy describing the struggle of ADHD,Bjartr,65,8,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/12ddkm/an_analogy_describing_the_struggle_of_adhd/,"As a long term sufferer of ADHD I recently thought up an analogy that maybe, just maybe, will give those who don't have it an idea of why ""just do the damn work"" is so frustrating to hear. 

&gt;So imagine you're standing about 10 feet from a wall, you have a ten foot long pole, and on the wall are targets. Each target represents some task, and to 'do' the task you have to poke the target and hold the pole there. Because of the weight of the pole combined with the leverage of its length you may not always get it on target the first try, and it might slip off if you're not paying attention, but it's not a particularly difficult task overall. 

That's a normal person

&gt;For ADHD (for me at least), the distance and targets are the same, but I'm using a ten foot long pool noodle with a magnet on the end.

&gt;and the advice you get most often is ""well, just poke the target!""

&gt;and all that's happening is you try to waggle the noodle in the general direction of the target, sometimes it'll get up for a moment, but then just flop off. Other times the magnet will stick, but to something other than what you were aiming for and now you have to try to waggle it off.

&gt;and the reason it gets so frustrating as a child is because you get so confused getting all sorts of advice that's useful with a pole but you're left wondering how the heck to apply that to the noodle, and despite how much effort you put into flailing you're still told off for being lazy.

I was actually really surprised how well this analogy describes my experiences with ADHD. It really only breaks down trying to describe how difficult it is for someone to articulate why they are having trouble applying all the advice they get.

For example, I really want to do ""well"" in school next year, and ""well"" for me has in the past been defined as getting all A's and maybe a few B's.  That has been my gold standard, and after consistently not hitting that mark, I've grown quite cynical when it comes to my own goals.  

I was wondering if anyone else here on r/ADHD has gone through this or something similar.  And what did you do about it?

What I think:
After some therapy and serious introspection about why I have begun to expect myself to fail, I realized I can't measure my success/failure as a person by my grades.  
I had a tough year last year, and my therapist (I never thought i needed therapy, but I've had one short session and it was great!) asked me if I could honestly say I did my best, taking into account all the circumstances.  

I realized that allthough there are things I could have done better, I still did my best.  Despite being half a planet away from home, and in a totally new environment I wanted to do well, I tried to do things right, and I hated that I didn't meet my or others expectations.  To me, this is proof that I am actually not a lazy person, and that instead of beating myself up for not getting things done, I should give myself ideas for how to better translate my wants, and goals into actions next year.

When did low GPA become DSM-IV criteria for ADHD? Especially when one scores ""severe"" and ""very severe"" for all other criteria. So, I'm being refused treatment (medication therapy AND counseling/coaching) just because my GPA is too high. She even said, ""Come back if your GPA falls anymore."" 

So now, due to shitty insurance, I am out of options and will remain unhelped for a good long while. 

The best part is, when interviewing me over the phone before my first appointment, she asked me what my GPA was. She could have told me right then and there that they wouldn't diagnose someone with a high GPA. But instead, she wasted my time (6-7 hours of work missed) and money. 

I'm hoping my psychiatrist (the school requires an official outside diagnosis) will argue my point and maybe change their minds, but it's doubtful.

I'm sorry for the rant. I'm just in such a rage right now and have nobody to tell. I guess I'm going to have to fight hard and learn how to cope with this myself. I'm positive I can overcome my problems, but professional help certainly wouldn't hurt.

I've never received any form of therapy.

My father is a narcisstic asshole and my mother a hysterical bitch. When I was 17, my dad thought my mum was having an affair and over a 3 month period, he would get shitfaced and terrorize the family, hitting my mother and rambling around with knifes and shit.

Then I turned 18, and (thanks to my unconditional love for adventures) decided that, even though the situation was okay at that time, I'd move out to live on my own, and proceeded to move to a metropolitan city 400 miles away all by myself. Keep in mind, from 15 to 18 I played 10+ hours of video games every day.

Life was good. In fact, I was living a dream. I quickly made friends, moved in with two lesbian stoner raver chicks, found a great job and started to develop a big self development ""obsession"", meeting a lot of women and so on.

Then I started to go to some raves with my housemates and, of course, started experimenting with drugs.

Some time in summer, I tried LSD and in the following weeks completely broke down mentally. I experienced tremendous amounts of sadness and fear for a few weeks, suffered from depersonalization and became depressed. It felt like the LSD took away the mask that I used to hide behind from my fears, unresolved emotional issues and trauma. Everything came out at once and hit me like a freight train. This happened 7 months ago.

Current situation. My life has hit rock bottom and somehow just keeps to collapse. My apartment looks like a crack house. I'm spending outrageous amounts of money (that I don't really have much oft) on stupid shit that I don't need (I'm broke right now and need to survive for another 2 weeks), including Cannabis and Adderall. Not even the Adderall makes me more motivated, just more concentrated. 

I regularly call in sick to work because I'm.. exhausted. That's the best word to describe it. My nutrition is horrible, most days I barely eat anything (and if I do, it's fast food).

I don't have much social contact any more and no close friends or lovers (obviously..)

I told him not to abuse medicine needed by others.  He said need is simply perception.  Here is my response.

ADHD is just as real as pain, both on a perceptual and a chemical level.  Every person diagnosed with ADHD has a different perception and tolerance level, much the same as everyone suffering from pain has a different perception and tolerance to the pain they are experiencing.  

Pain is caused by prostaglandins, the chemical responsible for both swelling and signaling to the brain that there is something wrong.  NSAIDs, the most popular category of OTC pain killers, stop pain and swelling by limiting the effect that prostaglandins have on the body.  Opiates act on several bases to alleviate pain.  They primarily act upon the Mu receptors, reducing the flow of painful stimulants.  They also act upon the limbic pathways, reducing the emotional response to pain.

ADHD is caused by a lack of neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) in the brain.  The brain of a person with ADHD is always in a constant state of desire for these neurotransmitters, exhibited by restlessness and distraction.  These constant external stimuli stimulate the brain to release a small amount of these neurotransmitters.  When one takes a stimulant (amphetamine, methylphenidate, cocaine, etc.), the brain either releases these neurotransmitters or blocks their reuptake, or both.  The more is taken, the more neurotransmitters are released.  When one with ADHD takes a stimulant, their levels of neurotransmitters rise to a level in which the brain is no longer in need of an external stimuli.

1354932128.0,54,self.ADHD,14h7jv,Do any of you talk to yourselves? Do you think it's a big deal? (mostly just looking to see if other ADHD people also do this) ,Luned,66,12,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/14h7jv/do_any_of_you_talk_to_yourselves_do_you_think_its/,"Hi, I am using a second account because Most people would find this very embarrassing, and while I don't personally find it so, I know how most people would feel knowing that I talk to myself. 

That's basically it. Since I was very little (back when it didn't matter if I talked to myself because all little kids do it) I have been talking to myself.   

For a long time I didn't realize that people could actually hear me. (I couldn't tell how loud I was being) and It has caused me to hurt people. Because I was telling myself how I was angry or whatever and they heard it... though I only said it in anger to myself. 

  I try very hard not to do it in public but sometimes It just comes out. I try very hard to make sure my mouth isn't moving too much (then they can only tell if they hear me) Also I try not to say anything too mean or disgusting. (once someone heard me say ""penis"" [I'm a girl]  then because My house was near theirs we were both going the same way and I couldn't get away.) 

I have learned to be OK with this, embarrassing moments aside, I realize that sometimes people can hear me, that some people know I do it and that all of them think it's weird. But for me it's just part of me.  Though when around people like family and friends or at work, it goes to a more ""normal"" amount and isn't a constant conversation with myself.

For me the weird part is this. For some reason back when I was little I would play pretend, like most all kids do.  While pretending to be whatever I was pretending to be or do I would talk to whoever I was imagining... and talk as if I were talking to someone even when I was only talking about me. Which I unfortunately still do. 

 I say ""us"" and ""we"" to actual people (whether I actually mean just me or not) because that is what I am used to saying. It confuses and most likely annoys most everyone. 

I am curious if other people with ADHD do this as well, or am I more of a weirdo than I already think I am. 

**TLDR:** I talk to myself, it's considered weird and I get it. I just don't see myself stopping anytime soon.

One thing I have noticed since being diagnosed is that reddit seems like an endless ADHD playground/hellscape.  

I really love how having so much interesting information available can be a great way to stimulate my constantly bored/restless mind.  I feel like getting on reddit really calms me down and lets me just absorb lots of stimulation.

I really hate how I get on here and all my time goes away and I don't get things done and I can always find one more interesting thing to read or another funny picture or some thing I've seen posted a hundred times in my years lurking or whatever.

So, here are my questions:

* How do you feel that reddit affects your life as ADHDers?
* Do you ever think it makes you crave even more stimulation?
* Do you find it therapeutic/helpful?
* (For those who have a better handle on ADHD or more experience) How do you moderate your reddit use?

Also, I'm reading *Delivered from Distraction* and the author mentions limiting TV, video games, internet use, etc. to help with symptoms.  

* Have any of you tried that? How did it work?

Thanks for all your help.

I was kicked out of university a year ago for poor academic progress. The last year I was at the university, I was getting help through the campus medical center in the form of Ritalin. That did help a lot, but I still did not have the organizational skills I needed to do well. Then after I was dropped, since I was no longer at the university, I could not get access to any medication and I did not have good experience with the doctors outside of campus, so I decided to go without. So I have spent the last year and a half now working hard to get good grades and turn myself into a better organized man at a community college. I need to get good enough grades at a lower level institution to get back into the university.  So after all this work, I am now at the end of my semester and I have at least two A's and two B's.  That isn't perfect obviously, but it was my best semester yet in 5 years of trying.  When I was at the university and first got diagnosed, I thought I may have just been lazy. This last year however, I have been eating healthier, exercising, sleeping full nights and on a regular schedule, and more importantly going to class every day and doing all the homework.

*Just wanted to remind people to **upvote this post**. Recently, our weekly threads get pushed off the page pretty quick. More upvotes = more wins = more people getting inspired (it is a cycle).*


#####Science behind Win Wednesday (new)


* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.

 * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.


* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field. 

 * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**


* **Soak in the positive events in your life**

 * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain. 


*I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good, let me know if you want more info.*

I am in college and have had the diagnosis of ADHD since I was seven.  My parents even knew something was ""off"" well before that.  I have been on and off countless medications, been in and out of therapy, and worked with all my schools to help accommodate my disorder.

This morning, I went to the university's psychology and health service center to hopefully be put back on meds. Overall, I have been able to cope with my ADHD since high school, but now my inattention, inability to focus, and impulsivity has been hurting my grades, so I'm trying to be responsible and get help before it becomes a problem.

The psychiatrist had reviewed all of my files beforehand, saw that my grades were average/high throughout K-12.  Also, he didn't see any sort of disciplinary action on my record (there were incidents, believe me, but none were put on my record so they didn't follow me).

In the end, I was told that I did not exhibit any of the ""patterns"" of ADHD because of my grades and records so therefore I can't have ADHD.  That was his only reasoning.  At first, I was speechless.  I tried explaining that I had been assessed at the center and I had a thorough diagnosis when I was seven.  That I have been able to cope with this through my amazing support network, but it didn't matter.  He claimed that having ADHD was an ""opinion diagnosis"" and equated my experience to ""wanting a knee replacement after climbing four flights of stairs to get there"".

I was so angry because apparently all of the hard work, tears, and struggling to overcome and deal with this disorder paid off, however because I succeeded I clearly don't have ADHD.  I still can't believe it.

Why I am asking:
I started seeking help for social anxiety last fall. My doctor referred me to a social worker, who thought I might have ADHD. She sent me back to my doctor, who sent me to a child psychiatrist - I have no idea why a child one (I am 25), they must have a good working relationship or something.

I found that he talked a lot in absolutes. He said that people with ADD or ADHD never like to read, and are absolutely not able to sit down and read a book. When I mentioned that I do know some people with ADHD who enjoy reading, he said that he can't be responsible for other doctors' misdiagnoses. Basically the extent of his diagnosis of me was asking if I could sit down and read an enjoyable book for an hour. When I said yes, he told me I couldn't have ADD. It is that simple.

He said people with ADHD cannot focus on anything, even on things they enjoy. But I have read about something called ""Hyperfocus"", which by definition seems to go against what he said.

I'm not saying I have ADD - he made some good arguments that it is my anxiety causing similar symptoms. But is he a crack? Does he just think in these absolutes because he is a child psychiatrist and has not dealt a lot with adults who may have developed coping mechanisms? Or can people with ADHD really not sit down and read a book?

While I'm normally of the school of thought around medication for ADHD, I've been still dabbling with trying to simply make more of an effort to be more productive.  This is in addition to taking my medicine.  Medicine or not, I'm not well prepared for staying productive since I've never really been productive.  I learned about David Allen's Getting Things Done productivity system a long time ago but dismissed it for being too complicated.  I never bothered to look further into it.  It seemed to be something for productivity nerds and not regular people.  I was very wrong.  I had an epiphany.  
  
It's the perfect productivity system for people struggling with ADHD.  
  
I don't mean to trivialize it with a bland summary, but it involves embracing the millions of tiny details that surround us every day.  This is normally what plagues ADHD patients.  The GTD system embraces them. It creates a central dumping ground for all of the stuff flying around in our heads.  
  
The basic premise is:  
1.  Have an idea/thought/whatever.  
2.  Capture the thought on something (no matter how trivial it may seem).  This is the inbox.  
3.  Process the inbox.  
4.  Act on the ideas.    
  
The processing part is where it becomes magical for ADHD.  Thoughts (referred to as ""actions"") are assigned contexts and projects.  A project is a multi-action thing.  A context is where an action or project may be localized.  There's a lot more to it, but that's the basic idea.  
  
Here's an example of how this works:  
  
I start thinking about washing my clothes.  Rather than assume I'll remember later, I *capture* this thought on something (paper, notebook, iPhone, whatever).  I'll need quarters do the laundry.  Capture it. I need to sort the clothes.  Capture it.  I need to buy some detergent.  Capture it.  In addition to the laundry, I start wondering about my cat.  She's running low on food and I really should get her more.  Normally, it's not just laundry and cat we're thinking about.  Pretend that there's also a hundred other ideas zipping by.  To be honest, under normal circumstances I'm going to fail at much of this.  Either my laundry will remain unwashed or my cat may be hungry until tomorrow because I forgot to one or the other.  Too many details!  
  
Let's look at how this gets handled...  
  
**Inbox:**  
1.  Wash clothes  
2.  Get a roll of quarters  
3.  Sort clothes  
4.  Buy detergent  
5.  Buy cat food  
6.  Feed cat  
  
**Assign some contexts...**  
Wash clothes (@Home)  
Get a roll of quarters (@Errand)  
Sort clothes (@Home)  
Buy detergent (@Errand)  
Buy cat food (@Errand)  
Feed cat (@Home)  
  
Let's create projects and assign the actions in order...  
  
**Project:  Do Laundry**  
1.  Sort clothes (@Home)  
2.  Get quarters (@Errand)  
3.  Get detergent (@Errand)  
4.  Wash clothes (@Home)  
  
**Project:  Cat Not Die**  
1.  Buy cat food (@Errand)  
2.  Feed cat (@Home)  
  
Okay, so it's starting to take shape!  I'm now in the habit of checking my GTD system (more on that later) whenever my context changes.  The idea is that GTD allows people to accomplish tasks independent of the project they're a part of and independent of other steps in that project.  So, when I leave my apartment to go to the store, I'll check my @Errand context.  
  
**@Errand:**      
1.  Get quarters  
2.  Get detergent  
3.  Buy cat food  
  
Ah!  So now I have a list of things I *can* accomplish right now!  They are seemingly independent of each other (cat food and detergent have nothing in common) but I'm still going to get my multiple goals settled!  So, I go to the store and buy detergent and cat food and pick up a roll of quarters from the cashier.  Time to start crossing off the items on my list!  After doing so, I arrive at home and check my @Home context...  
  
**@Home**  
1.  Sort clothes  
2.  Wash clothes  
3.  Feed cat  
  
So, there we go!  I'll sort my clothes, wash them, and feed the cat.  Suddenly (without realizing), I've completed my Laundry project and my Cat Not Die project.  They had nothing to do with each other except that they had tasks that could both be accomplished in the same contexts.  As I cross over my actions after doing them, suddenly all of my projects are done!  I'm just skimming the surface of this (there are tons of other ways to create this workflow inside GTS.  Action priorities.  Due date.  Time/effort needed to accomplish things.  Sequential versus Parallel projects.  There's a lot to this, but I just wanted to give everyone a brief overview.  
  
I've just been using it for the past couple of days and I feel so relieved.  One problem that my Adderall cannot fix is the feeling that I'm dropping the ball on something, somewhere.  Yes, I can focus on what I'm doing at the moment, but a lifetime of ADHD has create a constant feeling that I'm forgetting things.  I feel so much more confident that I'm not letting things slip through the cracks.  It just seems to me that this productivity system, while not designed for us, seems to easily fit for the ADHD mindset.  We are already thinking about a hundred unrelated things when trying to accomplish one.  This system ties these unrelated things to each other in unexpected ways.  Keep in mind, though, that I'm doing this in addition to taking my medication.  
  
There are a lot of ""systems"" that work with this.  Some people prefer paper and pen.  Others use technology for this.  I use an app called OmniFocus on my iPhone.  It was designed specifically for the GTD system, apparently.  GTD expert Merlin Mann (of 43Folders) consulted OmniGroup when they were making it.  There are a lot of other apps.  You don't even need one, but I find that my iPhone is a perfect capture tool since it tends to always be on me.

It seemed too complicated and chaotic to me too, but when I saw it as an ADHD self-help tool it all seemed to click.  I plan to perhaps post more about my progress with it if there's interest.

Every person has something(s) that sets them apart from everyone else, and ADHD is one of them. Albeit, a pretty big one. It has its positive and negative aspects, and many aspects that can go either way depending on how the person views it and handles it.

I appreciate:

* The level of scrutiny that I commit to nearly every thought. The thoughts may be irrelevant, short-lived, and quickly forgotten, but I never get bored of completely dissecting a thought and taking from it what I think will be useful later.

* The fact that having ADHD has made me a very creative thinker. I can almost effortlessly come up with different solutions to problems that no one else considered before, as a result of the micro-second thought-dissection with tangents branching in every direction.

* My initial level of interest in a new topic or hobby is so high that I'm able to consume a large amount of information about it and retain a good amount of the important parts. Of course, that level of interest will likely fade eventually, but the information will stay with me (usually).

* My ability to accurately read peoples' emotions and correctly assume their reaction to something. ADHD allowed me to acquire this ability as a result of the constant thought-dissection, and to form a sort of coping mechanism to prevent feelings of social anxiety. After a while, I got very good at reading people.

* And many others...

I don't appreciate all the symptoms that I'm sure we're all very familiar with. They can destroy my day, my week, or even my entire month sometimes. They cause high anxiety and depression, my self-esteem never stood a chance, I'm insecure about things most people don't care about, and it seems I will always be in a constant struggle with my own mind. But I'm steadily learning how to best deal with all of that. The symptoms will probably never go away and what should be simple obstacles will often become massive battles in my life. But I refuse to let the ADHD take control. It had its chance before I knew I had it, but I refuse to give it a second one.

1372283862.0,51,self.ADHD,1h4yds,I go between feeling like a complete fucking mess and feeling like I'm finally on the path to getting my life back in order. It feels like medication never helps.,pan0phobik,59,8,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1h4yds/i_go_between_feeling_like_a_complete_fucking_mess/,"I guess the purpose of this post is two-fold: **Is it possible to conquer ADD without medication?** And the other being that I'm trying to sort out **if my issues are mostly the result of ADD or if I'm just a lazy sack of shit**. I of course know laziness comes in to play, but I am never sure how much of it to blame on that.

 I feel like it's never truly helped my ADD symptoms. Apologies for the wall of text... but I feel like this is the first community that I can relate to when it comes to some sort of understanding of why I can never get my shit together 100% 

I have experienced **two** benefits. The feeling of wanting to get shit done the first few hours of the first few days I start taking my medication and weight loss. I've lost up to 50 lbs on adderall EASILY when working out and following some dieting.

After the first few days, the first benefit is almost gone completely until I run out and get prescribed a bigger dosage. Then the cycle repeats. I've been in and out of school through out my escapades with medicating and I have never truly felt a benefit in the one place that I am supposed to: Studying. I still feel I have to read things 3, 4, 5, 6, 7+ times to get them to sink in at all and even then I feel sketchy.

* I feel like I'm chasing a dragon that I've only gotten a couple grasps of and never even fully experienced and in this chase I'm starting to get bad side effects that I don't enjoy. When I was on various forms of Adderall I was having trouble eating normally. The thought of eating was almost sickening at times. I would drink water and eat just enough to not feel like I was completely empty and then when the medication wore off I'd eat like a pig and feel like shit about it.

I've just finished my first bottle of vyvanse and it felt great at first but now I never want it again. The last week or two of it I started experiencing strong mood swings. One negative memory/thought would drag me into a downward spiral of just focusing on everything negative about my life and everything I hate about myself.

* It seems like the biggest strides I've taken to improve my life (outside of my experience of losing 50 lbs, which I ended up gaining back unfortunately), have happened when I haven't been on any medication. Joining back with my martial arts training and getting myself back on track with school both happened when I wasn't on medication and I wasn't on medication for 90% of my first semester back when I actually got a decent grade in my class. First time that's happened in YEARS.

**Right now I'm on the upswing of my pendulum of life progression.** 

* I am back to training Martial Arts at least once a week. I SHOULD be going at least 2-3 but once a week is a lot better than not at all. This is very important to me because I feel like the positivity of my success in martial arts radiates exponentially to other parts of my life. After I do a good hour and a half class, I feel like a million bucks and like I can take on the world.

* I am also finally back on track with school. Ever since I realized that my Game Art &amp; Design major was not the right path for me, I feel I've never been able to fully recover from that mental crash. I grew up from age 8 thinking that was my purpose in life. I felt so incredibly passionate about it, but it just didn't pan out for me. That's a topic for another post though. I eventually found that IT was my path that I would have the most success in after working a tech support job with no training/shadowing/help and finding great satisfaction and success.

I am glad I have these things going for me but I want to be doing so much more. I have a lot of goals but I am terrified that I won't be able to achieve them all. I feel like I can't stay focused on any one thing long enough to fully see it through (Hence my being one belt away from black belt for over 10 years now). I get crazy motivation for something for a short period of time and then it fades in and out. Despite me consciously knowing how important it is and how much I truly care about it. I KNOW my life is nothing without martial arts. I would feel completely awful if I was without it and I want to go as far as possible, but yet I still have wasted so much time not following through. This messes with me so bad.

**A couple facts that might be throwing wrenches into medication not working for me** -

* I have hypothyroidism - I have read that this carries symptoms of ADD, so I am not sure how these two conditions interact.

* When I don't have steady employment, my sleep schedule is very volatile. With most ADD medications being a stimulant, I know this makes it difficult to stay on a regimen, which could be my issue with medication but I am very much a night person. Without a good paying job to keep me waking up at 8-9AM each day, it is pretty much inevitable that I will eventually devolve into staying up until 3-5AM and waking up at 10AM-1PM each day.

**tl;dr** **I want to manage my ADD without medication because I don't feel it has ever truly worked even when all conditions are prime for it to work (Good sleep schedule, being healthy, etc.) and I feel like I can never fully get priorities straight for more than a few months at a time. I am currently on a good path, but I want to be doing better. I don't know how to do it. I am confident that I won't be shaken from this path because I am having a lot more success than I've had in many years, but I'm still scared. I also want to be achieving more.**

With such a late diagnosis, I never cared for high-school.... simple work didn't require much attention to acquire sufficient grades to get by. As high school came to an end, I pretty much just shrugged my shoulders and said 'eh, nearby college would be fine'.

Years of business travel spoiled me into using standing in a nice hot shower as 'me' time because it was an unlimited supply of 'free' hot hotel water….    Side-note: I do acknowledge that this is not good for the environment and will take this timeout to say that I recycle, try to conserve elsewhere, some of my best friends are trees, etc etc…. ….anyways, that phase in my life embedded the habit of just spacing out when that water is pouring around me.  It's so bad that there have been times when I really was in an urgent hurry, told myself to get my a$$ in and out, and STILL caught myself just standing there spacing out!  I've tried putting a waterproof watch in my shower to keep track of 'real world' time in a place where time loses all meaning.  Sort of worked sometimes.  It's just been one of these stupid little things I absolutely have lost any control over.  The times when I tried to control it the most was when I spaced the hardest!  I KNOW some ADHDers will relate, which is why this is here and not in LPT. So this morning, I woke late, thought about skipping and just going to work…. But really wanted to shower.  So I got in and started counting.  My wife even asked me a question and I quickly answered it and got right back to counting (mostly silently).

90% of the time I have it pretty together. I am 24 years old and holding down a (terribly boring) job in customer service. I graduated college in 3 1/2 years, I go to the gym 5 days a week, I go for a walk on my lunch break to keep the office stressors from getting to me. But sometimes, for lack of a better word, I tantrum.

Now, I remember this feeling of frustration from growing up. I think my inability to handle certain stressors ( especially the kind that seem SO basic to non-adhd people) is what drove my mom to get me tested in third grade . ( that and the inability to sit through dinner and the daily leaving of my homework at home)

I kind of thought, though, that by my age I wouldn't get that screaming crying feeling so much anymore. Every once in a while, but often enough that it sucks, I get so frustrated by, say, the job application process (specifically manually entering all the details from my resume) that I FREAK OUT and it feels like both it and I are unfixable and I just want to break something. 

Last night I was trying to finish some job applications (toget me out of a job that is NOT. A good fit) and I swear I freaked out like I was nine years old. I am not proud, and I'm more embarrassed that my awesome supportive boyfriend was there to see me like that. 

Does any one else ever feel like this? Better yet, who has overcome this and how??

Adult ADHD is not recognised in France. ,IAMAspirit,56,6,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/18n1dv/how_do_you_get_a_psychiatrist_to_seriously/,"More specifically, ADHD-PI. It's become more and more of a nuisance and I really want to get it **officially diagnosed** so I can get some help, and for people not to brush me off as lazy/incompetent.

I somehow managed to get my B.A. (barely passing) and am now in my first masters year (2 years for a masters degree). Up until now, I've always managed to skirt around the average. I have always been right at that average mark. But this year is demanding way more time and focus, and I just can't keep up, and have failed my first semester. I've had failing grades at school for as long as I can remember. Also, I can barely math.

I discovered this subreddit by a comment that was bestof'ed and realise a lot of the symptoms apply to me (including further research): 

I space out a lot, have trouble keeping track when a person is talking to me, cannot get motivated to do things unless someone else motivates me, **forget things A LOT** (like exiting the house only to return and exit five more times because I kept forgetting to take something), am slower than others in understanding instructions and need people to repeat themselves (**the sounds are there I just don't know what you're saying!**), and can't organise anything for the life of me. Also, it would seem I'm always the last to know what's going on (events, info the teachers gave...), and **I'm perpetually late to anything** no matter what.

Just recently I had an exam and I'm like okay, I got this shit, time to focus... 10 minutes later I'm thinking about what I'm going to do on the weekend, what's for dinner, should I write that story, that new series is out--**fuck, fuck, fuck! Concentrate!** My mind doesn't wonder so much about unrelated zillion bits of random info, just everything and anything that relates back to me or my interests.

Another quirk I have is that my friends say that I don't seem to have much of an opinion on anything until I suddenly latch on to something that interests me, and then **I will keep arguing** about it, totally **ignoring their facial expressions** of discomfort/annoyance. I also avoid anything that will make me anxious (talking about grades/studying, social interaction with strangers...)

Sometimes I will stop mid-sentence as I forgot what I was talking about. This will become very crippling if I am to become a teacher (what my degree is for).

I've talked about it to my general practitioner, but he brushed it off, saying I should make lists and try to pay more attention. My mother is on the fence about it too. It doesn't help that **adult ADHD is seen as a myth**, or something invented by Americans who are always quick to medicate every little thing. So my question is: if you live in a country where adult ADHD is a controversial notion and still managed to get treatment, **how did you get your psychiatrist to entertain looking for ADHD?** Instead of believing you picked up some imaginary illness you read about on the internet. 

(sorry the post is wordy. I don't how to make it more succinct and pretty.)

In fact, I've been early because, as many of you pointed out, it's the only way to not be late for us chronically-challenged individuals.

So far, it's been successful and I haven't heard anything negative from the office of the boss (or anything positive, for that matter, but whatever- ill give myself a damn cookie and pat on the back...).

1370913857.0,47,self.ADHD,1g361e,"Perfectionism, ADHD, writing, and, hell, everything else",Bostonpat,54,7,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1g361e/perfectionism_adhd_writing_and_hell_everything/,"TL;DR: Serious problems with motivation, indecision, overwhelm, procrastination, perfectionism

I've probably been ADhD (lower case h) for years, though the diagnosis was only made in the past 5 years, along with a long-lasting case of dysthymia, after being incorrectly diagnosed with Bipolar disorder (influenced by my mother, but that's another story). In late college, after years of being called ""King Procrastinor"" by my mother, I was prescribed Vyvanse. It was like God himself in pill form. Everything seemed so much more interesting. My schoolwork would get done more quickly and efficiently than ever before, to my own surprise and delight. Together with my roommate (who had his own Adderall XR prescription), we would have ""wired days"" where we took our pills together and were just profoundly productive, getting our schoolwork done EARLY (shock of shocks, if you knew us), and ending in getting drunk. Good times.

Fast forward a few years, and I'm still taking Vyvanse, but the productivity has been replaced with procrastination, anxiety, and avoidance. In college, my to-do list was dominated by things I ""had to do,"" and thus had no problem prioritizing and attacking, one by one. My to-do list now is mainly things I ""want to do,"" and ironically, I don't feel the same motivation or drive that I did for schoolwork. I have items on this to-do divided into three categories based on their overall importance and value, but I might as well just randomly throw them together. Everything, even the minor, insignificant tasks that have comparatively little value (hell, even some things I want to AVOID), suddenly seem like the most important, fulfilling thing I could possibly accomplish, all at the same time. And whenever this happens, I want all these tasks done and completed either yesterday, or at that exact moment, right now, no hesitation. 

Accordingly, I start whimpering in anxiety, walking around in circles, having an ""episode"" over trying to figure out what can be done, what should be done first, what's the best thing to do, etc. Obviously, in this state, NOTHING gets done. I keep worrying that if I do one thing, I'm not doing another, and what if that other thing is the thing I need to be doing to feel most productive and to make my life better, what if this inspires me and turns out to be amazing, and...and...and..?

This phenomenon is most notable when I try to write. I'm told I'm a good writer. Writing is, pretty much, the only talent I have, and my long-term goal/dream is to be a published author. The problem? First, as above, I'm wracked with indecision in writing. I have what some call ""morgue files"" on my laptop and in notebooks. I have hundreds, maybe thousands, of pieces of dialogue, description,  settings, character traits, events, images, emotions, thoughts, etc., that I feel could be used in a story someday, in addition to countless prompts and ideas I've collected. When I sit down to write, or to create plot ideas, I'm so overwhelmed by the sheer number of options, I can't cope. Every single setting, quote, and situation seems ripe for a story, and I can't figure out where to begin, which deserves attention, what elements would go well together. And so nothing gets done; I'm disappointed and frustrated, all those possible story elements remain separate and impotent, and another day is wasted worrying about what could be done rather than doing anything. 
(And that's to say nothing of my perfectionism. No matter how much I tell myself it's unreasonable, I still have this image in my head of literary perfection miraculously spilling forth, and this ""urge"" to feel complete, like I need every possible inspiration, resource, idea, prompt, etc. before I begin to work. This is basically why I've wasted entire days searching for ""inspiration"" on StumbleUpon and the like).

I'm still in therapy, in the process of dealing with dysthymia (which itself has a whole host of issues), but I'm at my wit's end dealing with this unending unproductive funk. Are there any other ADHD writers/artists/creatives out there who have dealt with this? Any suggestions for dealing with indecision-anxiety and stuff like that in general?

This topic is aimed at people who DON'T want to give away their meds but may be pressured into it.  I didn't think that needed explaining.  If you choose to share your meds with your friends that's your own business but you don't need to post here advocating it.  That's a dick move.)**

I keep seeing this coming up in comments and I'm sure there have been topics dedicated to it in the past (I wish reddit allowed you to bump topics, people always cry ""repost"" when there's no other option) and I wanted to say something about it.  
  
I assume if someone's asking for your meds that you're either in school/college/uni or you hang around with a lot of drug users.  No reasonable and responsible adult would ask someone else for their medication.  
  

I only started on meds this year (I'm 33) but if I'd been taking them 10-15 years ago I might have had friends who asked for some and I might've either given them away gladly or at least felt awkward about saying no.  In fact I do know one guy who I'm certain will ask for some if I ever tell him I'm on them.  As someone who doesn't like confrontation of any kind I'm not looking forward to that conversation.  
  
  


  
But if that conversation happens, I'll simply say ""no"".    

Those of you who are younger, I can picture your conversations.   Your friend asking you first jokingly, to ""feel you out"".  You trying to laugh it off.  Them pushing it a bit further.  You saying you're not really sure or you could get in trouble or you need them for yourself.  Them getting a bit aggressive and asking why you won't share.  This is your friend after all.  You apologising and saying you just don't think you should.  Them saying they only want one or two and they'll even pay you for it, or let you have that video game you wanted or favour you needed.  You giving in and saying ok, but only a couple.  Them telling your other friends and everybody hinting at you that they want some.  You wishing you never told anyone about the meds to begin with.  

Cut out all that bullshit before it begins.  If someone, anyone, asks if they can have/buy/try your meds just look them in the eye and say ""No"".  Anything they say after that you respond, just once, with ""I said no"".  Then walk out of the room or change the subject or whatever you need to do to signal that the conversation is over.   

Never apologise.  Never explain.   

If you go into even the slightest dialogue with them, it's a signal that the subject is debatable.  That it can be discussed.  Don't afford them that opening.  Shut the conversation down before it begins.   
  
  
It's possible you could lose this person as a friend.  That's a bonus.  Sometimes, especially when we're young, we have friends that we know we're wasting our time with but don't have the guts to say ""I don't wanna hang out with you anymore"".  If this person fucks off because you wouldn't share your meds with them, they saved you from that awkward process of gradually disassociating yourself from someone.  
  
**edit:**  Some below have mentioned the illegality factor.  The problem is that selling/sharing medication is a crime that doesn't feel like a crime.  Impulsiveness and lack of foresight can basically drive a tank over those kinds of risks.  From my own experiences I find that in certain situations where you know something is wrong but have to remember a multitude of factors when faced with a decision, it's better to simply file it under ""things I do not do"".  This is what I have to do with Bookies (betting shops, I don't know what they're called in other countries) because in the moment I struggle to recall the various pros and cons I've been over in the past and my impulsiveness clouds my judgement.  So instead of thinking of betting as something I shouldn't do because of a well reasoned argument, I just shut it down the moment I begin considering it (which is most times I pass a Bookies with cash in my pocket).  

My point, both here and above, is that letting anyone have your medication is something that you shouldn't wrestle with.  The ""why"" doesn't matter.  If you have ADHD there are some things with which you can't trust yourself to remember the ""why/why not?"" in the heat of an impulsive moment, so just blacklist them in your mind and in the future trust yourself that you blacklisted them for good reasons, even if you can't recall all of those reasons in the moment between the suggestion of an action and the execution of that action.  You can start that list with:  Hard drugs.  Unprotected sex.  Gambling.  Spending money on a hobby you only took an interest in within the last 24 hours.

I started taking Adderall about 7 months ago when I had health insurance through my current employment. Eventually, the company experienced some financial downturns and I worked out an arrangement with my boss to cut my hours down to part-time (so they would not have to pay for my health insurance), but they upped my pay to make up the difference. 

I was a bit apprehensive at first, because Adderall had really helped my mind slow down, though I still wrestled with being inattentive.

During the time I was on it, I managed to develop some better work habits (writing things down, keeping a list of potential projects, etc.) since I was able to focus a bit easier on finding things to do. 

The day after I ran out, I was worried what it would be like trying to keep the same routine, but fortunately, the habits I had managed to develop for work carried over and I've been able to keep myself pretty balanced without the medication. I still have a hard time focusing, but I find it easier to get things done, and to stick to finishing projects. 

It's strange because I never realized how effective writing things down could be.

The general consensus seemed to be that I would be fine, but I wanted to be doubly sure that I wasn't going to be detained at the boarder.

After much digging I figured out I needed to talk to the [Office of Controlled Substances](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/contact/dhp-mps/hecs-dgsesc/ocs-bsc-eng.php).  I called their general contact number 613-952-2177.

The gentleman I spoke with was very helpful and said as long as I brought 30 days or less worth of medication, in its original bottle, and declared it when crossing the boarder, there should not be a problem.  He also gave me his contact information and told me to call him if I have any problems.  He also emailed me and provided a [direct link to the medication guidelines](http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hc-ps/substancontrol/pol/pol-docs/travellers-voyageurs-eng.php). Here is the most relevant part of the email:

&gt;Briefly, the individual can bring a 30-day supply of the substance that has been obtained under a prescription and is packaged in pharmacy or hospital dispensed packaging with the appropriate labeling.

A combination of drug addiction, social phobias and i guess just generally being fucked up in the head have really put me in a spot where i might not graduate college.

 I love business and what i am learning and i am good at it but i for the life of myself can not sit down and study in the manner required to pass, i will do anything but, even study non-school topics. My worries were recently compounded when i learned, in the states, the ADHD population has less than a 5% college graduation rate compared to 26% of the general population. I am starting to worry i wont graduate. Even the worry is not motivation enough. At the end of the day I understand i just need to DO WORK SON, but the effort involved is momentous.

**Can the question be answered in one word?** If so, **where is there room for discussion**?  Where is the incentive to click the link and read into what was written?

 3. *scrolls down to next post*


*We want activity here!*  **We love it when people are here helping each other** out or just connecting with others due to what we have in common!  

It's just that these **DAE-styled titles** **don't seem to be working as well** as some others.  There's no thought involved in answering *yes* or *no*.

 * I think I might be ADHD..

We like new people, we really do!  **But if you've got one overarching concern or question, put that as the title.**

Example:
 * Is medication my only option, or are there other (scientifically-backed) treatments I can supplement?
 * I'm scared about telling [person of authority] so that I can get tested.  What kind of tricks or tips do you guys have to overcome this?

I hesitate to do this, but..  If you guys are unsure about your title, *shoot it my way in a private message*.  I don't know if the rest of the mods have the time or the energy to help in this capacity, but I might be able to do a few here or there just to exercise my wordular gland.

We have a **nifty [FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/ADHD)** that should be able to **point most people in a solid direction.**  Yes, I know it needs some more work...   We'll get right on that, we swear!

I hope the examples below can help to spur some literary creativity.

***

###These were just a few that were pointed out that I decided to take a crack at.  No disrespect is meant to the original author.  We are not singling anyone out.

##Wording Changes
&gt;Made myself lunch, then Ritalin kicked in and I couldn't eat more than two bites. Happen to anyone else?

**I'm having a hard time eating while on my medication.  What tricks do you guys use to make sure you keep eating?**

 1. Anyone have experience with Vyvanse?

   * I have a few questions for those of you with experience with Vyvanse

   * And then the self text has a list of specific questions (like, *How does it affect your mood?* etc.)

 1. Would you be upset if your doctor was not telling you the truth?
   * I feel like my doctor isn't telling me the truth about my medication
 2. Does anyone else not have any ADHD support groups? Are they even useful?
   * To those of you who go to ADHD support groups, what kind of help and support did they provide compared to a psychologist/psychiatrist?
 3. DAE, have trouble trying to explain information to others?
   * I find myself having a hard time explaining things to people.  Does anyone have any ideas or tactics to work on this?

OK, I do want to single one post out, since I just ran across it again.

 * [I've been on Strattera for ten days. Pleasantly surprised!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/svgdc/ive_been_on_strattera_for_ten_days_pleasantly/)

I like this a lot!  **I love reading success stories!**  *Share them!*  Seeing you succeed reaffirms that I can succeed.  
***
##Idea: Weekly Q&amp;A Thread
Another option we have would be to have a weekly question and answer thread.  

**You ask questions**, whatever questions you have about your medication or ADHD or habits or whatever, and **someone answers**.  There would be a **persistant link at the top of the reddit** that will always link to the most recent Q&amp;A thread.

**We've got a fair amount of weekly threads** at the moment (To Accomplish Tuesday, Win Wednesday, Folly Friday, Start it Sunday (is that one, or am I just imagining things?)).  **How do you guys feel about those?**  

I am a huge fan of the To Accomplish and Win threads.  And I do like the idea of the Folly thread, as I feel it's a place to share  our little mix-ups or accidents with people who actually understand *why* we ""do"" these kinds of things.

They started out with fantastic participation, **but have kind of petered out a bit**.  I think **we're gonna keep trying**, though, since they are great ideas and have seemed to do quite a bit of good for many people.
***
##We are a community of understanding and support
**This community is pretty darn fantastic.**  *Keep it up everyone!*  I just feel as if I should say the below anyway, though, just so that it is written somewhere.

**It never helps to be condescending or rude.**   Throughout our interactions in this subreddit, keep in mind that everyone here is at different stages in their lives, in their acceptance, in their treatment.  

You or I may have already come to terms with the fact that we operate quite differently than non-ADHD people, but there are plenty of us who are.. well, frankly, scared.  Or upset.  Or even angry!  I don't blame them!  

**We're not asking you to be mind readers and fully understand someone's situation..**  It's just that some of us may have never experienced those emotions in this context, so it might be a bit harder to relate.  

**Just be friendly in your interactions here.** :)
***
##We have a real time chatroom, too!
You can join us extremely easily by using the [web chat link](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/ADHD)!

If you're IRC savvy, we're in #[/r/ADHD](/r/ADHD) on irc.freenode.net.

**Conversation may be slow or dead at times.**  We have people from all over the world, people with all sorts of schedules, and people who hyperfocus on things away from the chat.  

**If you don't get an answer right away, don't sign off!** There is nothing more frustrating than seeing someone ask a question and disappear only two minutes later!

**The chat and the subreddit are the same community.**  The same rules and guidelines apply.
***
##What concerns does the *community* have?
**Do you see anything around here you want to discuss?**

I do have a couple of targeted questions:

 * **What are your thoughts on the current visual style?**
 * **How do you feel about the weekly threads?**

***
##You guys freaking rock!
**Thank you guys!**  **I really enjoy this community!**  Honestly, it is the only subreddit that I frequently visit anymore.  I barely see my reddit home page these days, I always just go straight to [/r/ADHD](/r/ADHD)!

It worked well in high school and college, but now that I'm in the work world (in my first year at a real job, after a coupla years of paid internships to break in), it's just not sustainable—I pull one every couple weeks, sometimes more. It's not that I'm dicking around at work all day, I just somehow manage to tackle all the small tasks and not address the large one, which means I then have to finish it at home. And it wouldn't be an issue if I could go home and just work—but inevitably I get distracted, put it off, fiddle around on other projects, look up 'one quick thing' that ends up sucking an hour of time, and then don't get started until 1 or 2 am.

I also had my grandmother on my case about homework ALL the time. So I learned to work with it the best I could, and ended up being a C student throughout high school(I could have been an A or B student).

So after I moved out on my own and went to college, got a girlfriend who's brother had ADD and was on meds and she's pretty much like ""Yeah, you have ADD.""  While living and going to school on my own, I don't have someone to constantly push me to do work, so I've been struggling quite a bit in college, and decided to get help, because without it, I felt I would flunk out. 

I got tested, and I was diagnosed with no surprise as ADD.  And was sent to a psychiatrist.  I had seen this same psychiatrist **once** earlier this year when I went in to try and figure out anxiety and depression because I wasn't performing as well as I could.  So this psychiatrist demanded that I re-take the ADD test as he didn't believe I had ADD.  After I passed it again and got 2 letters from a friend and a close family member, he reluctantly put me on Adderall, after saying ""I'm doing this, but understand it's much more honorable to conquer your problems without medication."" 

I started to feel guilty after this thinking I was making the wrong decision by taking meds. Still do.

And then I was also told by a mother of a few kids I babysit who also had ADD in college, told me to go by the Disabled Student Services at my college and ask them for help on making it through college, and that the DSS are the sole reason she made it through college. So I did, they gave me paperwork for my doctor to fill out, and I dropped them off with my doctor.

I just got a call today from him saying that he refuses to fill out the forms, because if the Adderall helps, I won't need help from disabled student services.

Problem is, is that I'm already more than halfway into the semester, I've made a few lower than average scores on tests, and the disabled student services has a program to request extra credit from teachers to make up some lower scores due to ADD. So some of it is for earlier in the semester before I started the medication.

On top of that, I'm still adapting to the medication, and still training my newfound focus on actually doing my homework and school work, rather than focusing on other things that I want to do.

Sorry for the novel, but I just want to know if it's ethical for someone who's supposed to help, to deny things that could help me get through college.

**tl;dr: I am just starting treatment with Adderall in the middle of my college semester, and my psychiatrist refuses to fill out paperwork for Disabled Student Services to help me get through the rest of college with ADD.**

**EDIT: Thanks for all the replies. I did some research on him tonight, and it turns out he's been getting low reviews and complaints for about 2 years now. What should I do?**

**EDIT 2: Here's one of the reviews which is from 2010:**
&gt;*Worst doctor I've ever visited. This is what would happen if Tony Soprano was the psych, and not the patient. He has the same overbearing, insistent, and ego-centric approach. First visit I'm told that the issue is major depression because (with extreme hand gestures) ""its written all over my face"". That and his demeanor (inconsiderate) and cancelling the second appt (my second cancellation by kaiser in four) led me to request another doctor. I mentioned his attitude as a reason for my request. In the end I stayed with a second visit to save time (I was into my fourth month without treatment!), and was greeted instantly with a ""so you complained about me, huh?"". Seriously? To a patient you think is heavily depressed? Sadly, it seems management has his back, as none of my complaints were addressed (I even payed the co-pay for the one minute visit).

I use the Shire Cares Patient Savings Program to get 12 free prescriptions of Vyvanse (b/c I'm uninsured and it's *really* expensive). I sent off my reapplication last month and I still haven't gotten my card. I called yesterday and they told me they had my application but that it'll be a minimum of four days until they mail it back. Ugh. 

So, who has two thumbs and two Vyvnase pills left? This gal. And I have to ration them for two events this week. After they're gone, I don't know how much longer I'm going to have to hold out until my card comes. Today makes two straight days of no meds. 

Yesterday wasn't bad; in fact, I felt almost euphoric. I felt free and happy. The annoying repetitions and cycling thoughts were still in my head but I wasn't annoyed by them, more amused than anything. ""Okay,"" I thought to myself. ""This isn't so bad. I could even see myself coming off of my meds someday. Of course, there's that distinct possibility that I have meds in my system still and tomorrow will be a different story...""

Today *is* a different story. I feel fuzzy, foggy, almost like being drunk. It has been **very** difficult to get things done today. My attention is absolutely shot. I *have* made significant progress on the task I set out to do (cleaning the dining room. It's sort of become a catch-all in my house) but it's taken me all day. Medicated, this would have taken me about three hours. My ability to multitask has been severely reduced, if not completely annihilated. I walk around in a haze, it seems. I have to put 100% focus into the task at hand. I've been distracted--rotating from the dining room, to watching Star Trek: The Original Series, to crocheting, to cleaning...and now to Reddit. 


I'm frustrated and irritated and sad. I remember the way I felt as a child before my diagnosis and treatment. I remember how frustrated I was when I first started medication and how much better life became once they found the right medication and dosage. I've worked so hard to handle having ADHD all my life, and today I just feel....sucky. I still have all the tools and coping techniques at hand; I just have to work harder right now, and it's absolutely exhausting. 

I was diagnosed in fourth grade and now I'm 25. This is the first time since then that I've been unmedicated for so long (please don't yell at me, guys. I know a lot of you take med vacations. I just never felt the need to.) I've learned all sorts of wonderful coping techniques for when I'm medicated and very few for when I'm not. **I realize now more than ever what it  means to have ADHD, how much it can suck, and screw people who don't think it exists.** I'm disappointed in myself today, but proud I've managed to get *something* done. 

I'm sorry for the wall of text; I know it's taboo in this thread. I'm on my phone. This subreddit has been an amazing support to me and I just want to say thank you. The reason I've managed to get anything done today is because of the advice I've read here.

Luckily i didn't miss the call from my psychiatrist's office this time letting me know there was a cancellation. 

It was 9AM and the available appointment was at 10. I ran to my supervisors office and asked and told her it was to treat my ADHD. She told me to run like the wind. I've had a very understanding boss. 

It was my first visit to a psychiatrist. He didn't hook me up to machines, inundate me with examinations, or delve into the history of my inner hatred toward Justin Bieber. 

Long story short he said I had severe ADHD. My acting career hid the symptoms as a child and I've just been coping at increasingly ineffective levels ever since. 

He put me on a very aggressive titration. Ritalin 10 twice a day for 5 days, then 20mg twice a day for 5 days, and finally 30mg twice a day for 10 days with a follow up appointment. 

My first dose was like waiting for Christmas. I had done it. I finally got help and this was what I had been waiting for. I became slightly light headed and extremely thirsty at work. I decided I should just go about my day and see what happens instead of waiting around and inducing a placebo effect. 

So i got to work. Aside from the light headedness I was wondering if it was even working. Then I realized I had just completed a task I had been putting of for a month. People came in my office to talk. I chatted, went back to work. By the end of the day I had completed 5 tasks in 2 hours. A record for me. 

I read a chapter in my book for school. Held an online conversation simultaneously. Took a quiz over the chapter and made a 95. Insane. 

The next day I destroyed my to do list. Furthermore my phone had 75% battery at the end of the day. I hadn't looked at reddit once or anything else for that matter. 

In my personal life I listen better. I think before I speak and I stopped eating as much junk food. I drink half as many coke zeros as I did, and have lost 4 pounds. I was also able to write this long ass post without stopping. 

I read that it affects your appetite. This has not been the case. I just don't eat candy as a snack anymore. 

Anyway just wanted to share my experience. If anyone read this and hasn't been diagnosed, please get out there and do it. Every task completed is a victory when you have adhd.

I immediately joined a gym and then, three months later, started a serious diet. For the gym, I go six days a week for 45 to 75 minutes a day. It took me awhile to figure this out, but it was best to go very early in the morning. I was never an early riser, but it feels good to be there by 6:15 am at the latest.

It felt really good to feel strong, to have extra strength in my legs and arms - a huge confidence-builder.

I waited on the diet - I wanted to take things slowly - to first make a solid habit out of the gym, and then deal with the diet. I chose the paleo diet for a number of reasons, and have been on it for three weeks. I've lost 7 pounds so far.

Overall, I still forget things all the time, and sometimes don't feel like doing work. But I feel much calmer, I fall asleep easier at night, wake up earlier, have more positive energy. I also feel more positive - like I have more control over my life. Some other side-effects of Adderall XR and Prozac are gone. I don't feel the jumpiness from Adderall, nor do I constantly feel the dry mouth from Prozac.

And how do you stop yourself?,_badpseudonym,56,11,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1f28xa/adhd_and_skin_pickingbiting_do_you_do_it_and_how/,"I suspect a lot of us have problems with skin and nail picking and/or biting (which, I found out today, is called dermatillomania/dermatophagia and is apparently classed as impulse control disorder in its own right).

I've been doing it as long as I can remember, and it's definitely my way of getting out all that excess ADHD restlessness. I bite my nails less these days because I like keeping them a nice length... buuuuut then the effect is kind of ruined by the surrounding skin being red raw.

Curiously, I found myself barely doing it at all when I was taking methylphenidate, but am really struggling again since switching to amphetamine. I had to switch medication as Concerta was causing me severe anxiety. I'm now taking Elvanse which works great, except for the fact that a lot of my newfound focus seems to go towards this picking/biting habit. So in a way, I'm worried it's making it worse. And of course when the meds wear off I still do it, and can also no longer prioritise in the slightest. (I spent an hour before bed last night going at the skin around my nails, despite being so exhausted I could barely keep my eyes open. SO. ANNOYING.)

The real trouble is that doing it often really helps me to concentrate, so when writing (which I do a lot) or trying to maintain a conversation, I will have desperate urges to gnaw/pick. I especially hate that I do it in social situations as I'm probably grossing out everyone around me, but I could lose focus on the conversation if I stop.

So, to finally get to the point - I was wondering if anyone else is struggling with this and if you have any tips to help me stop, or at least suggestions for other things I can pick at, play with, or do with my hands/mouth instead? Which is a sentence so innuendo-laden it sounds like it could be lifted from a *Carry On* film. (*Carry On ADHDing*?)

**TL;DR: 
Compulsive skin/nail picker and biter. Do any of you do this? If you managed to stop, how? If you found something equally satisfying to do instead, what? Please give me some tips before I tear my hands to shreds and/or spend my life savings on plasters.**


**ETA:**
~~I found a replacement that might help those of you who shave your legs. If you're doing something that doesn't require the constant attention of your eyes - eg, having a phone conversation, listening to something, idly watching something, etc - try tweezing your leg stubble. Quite satisfying and doesn't damage you (so long as you don't dig at ingrown hairs!)~~

1368843158.0,45,self.ADHD,1ek132,Found a NY Times article discussing the correlation between ADHD and Sleep Disorders. (INCREDIBLY interesting.

Written by Vatsal G. Thakkar
From *The New York Times* Opinion page article dated April 28th, 2013. 

The author is a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the N.Y.U. School of Medicine. He describes several recent and long-term studies supporting the case for a positive correlation between ADHD diagnoses/ misdiagnoses and sleep disorders/deficiencies. In other words, He proposes that the treatment of one issue may be actually be the cure for the other,  or that one issue may be caused by the other if it is left untreated.  


For example: One study suggests that potential cause of ADHD may be from sleep-disordered breathing during infancy.  In fact, most of the studies he references are Pediatric in nature...which – and this is purely my own conjecture – suggests that real ""lifelong"" ADHD is basically caused *after* birth (not before it), and its extent is predominantly affected by our sleep functionality between the ages of 0-7 years.  Anyways,  the author  later goes on to describe how he personally had been first diagnosed with ADHD in college, and later found that he had an atypical form of Narcolepsy - One that produces a massive excess of REM/dream sleep (up to 40% of his total sleep time) and massive deficit of Delta/""Rejuvenating"" sleep (only a mere 5% of his total sleep time). 


I strongly suggest you all take a look at the article. Even if you cant find a personal connection to relate with it, You might find it helpful.  Knowledge is power right? :)


**PERSONAL NOTE:** After reading the article, I basically sh#t myself -- emotionally, that is (lol). Like the author, I was diagnosed with ADHD in college (just after my freshman semester, 2006). Even more amazing to me is that just last year *I too *was diagnosed with the *identical* form of narcolepsy as the author. Not only that, but as a newborn I had breathing issues and was placed in an incubator for the first 3 weeks of my life.  Having those pieces of my personal puzzle coming together like that was, well…It was a profound feeling to say the least! It was like looking at a mirror and seeing a NY Times article instead, lol. Now I guess I have real life example before me, but im pretty sure that just leaves me with even more questions.


**TL; DR** - The article discusses the overwhelming correlation between ADHD and Sleep Disorders. It suggests that ADHD itself (and ADHD symptoms) may actually be an indication, or even be caused by undiagnosed pre-existing or ongoing sleep disorders/deficiencies.

I was raised in a household where ADHD, depression, and the like were seen as attention-seeking behaviour or excuses for lazy people who don't want to ""do things the hard way"".

I've since been diagnosed with both, and I've definitely seen enormous improvement since doing CBT and taking medication, but some days I still have trouble convincing myself that my struggles are legitimate. 

This is reinforced every time I hear/read someone talking about how disgusted they are that some people just pop pills to solve their problems instead of manning up and dealing with it the ""normal"" way. And I don't know if it's regional or what, but this seems to be an extremely common view here. And every time I see/hear it, no matter how ludicrous, part of me automatically takes it to heart.

It's a free todo list thing (although I think they have a paid version that does more tricks, but I haven't tried it yet).

Anyway it's super beneficial to me because I don't have to hold everything in my head (which makes me very stressed out). When I come to work during the day I have one task and one task only - create the to do list for the day. Then, I go through each item one at a time, which really helps me not stress about the whole thing and stay organized. Plus, it's even a bit nice to see ""tasks completed"" and watch it go away when I'm finished with an item. I don't really feel any accomplishment when I DO get something done, but I do feel a bit nice when the task goes away on the list.

I'm currently in grad school, and I know my reasoning skills and academic writing are probably the main things that set me apart from my undergraduate peers in the first place, paving the way for my admission into my current program.

But now that I'm here, I am finding it harder and harder to keep up with all the writing, for a variety of reasons I know are ADHD-related (motivation, procrastination, organization, etc.), but also due to a crippling obsession with reviewing, backspacing, and re-writing each and every sentence until I feel it is *absolutely perfect.*

This compulsive perfectionism kicks in any time I write anything: whether it's a text message to my brother or a 20-page essay, I find myself continually re-reading the sentence so far, thinking of a better way to phrase it, backspacing, retyping it differently, re-reading it... you get the idea. (By the way, I've been ~~working on~~ typing this post for ~~approximately~~ about 30 minutes now...)

I really don't think I am OCD- my room is in a state of ADHD disorganization, my sink is full of dishes, and I don't have many other strange compulsions.

I'm a huge fan of podcasts right now; they've become one of the best ways I keep on news and learn new things! In addition to them being informative, interesting and entertaining I've also found they make a formidable tool for battling procrastination! Especially the kind of procrastination that comes from menial activities like chores, (ie. Vacuuming, Washing Dishes, Laundry, etc). 

**Here's how it works...**
When I know I have to do some chores but REALLY can't bring myself to do them I'll check my rss feeds, throw some headphones on, and start listening. Typically it only takes a minute or two until I'm focused on the podcast and start to feel 'invested'. That's also typically when my mind starts to wander, and I have to rewind the podcast a minute or two to catch back up. That's when the chore comes in, start doing the chore you don't want to do and if you're like me your capacity to focus on the podcast, and in turn your enjoyment of it, will be vastly improved; you'll also be doing something productive which should lead to less anxiety.
This obviously isn't perfect; you still have to have the presence of mind to think ""I should really be doing the dishes"", and if you can't manage that once in awhile it's not going to do you any good. I do find that when I start to get anxiety and guilt about procrastination it's typically the *very* best time to do it. It curbs your anxious thoughts and is a huge distraction from them, which for me anyway is **very** calming.
I also find that when I wear headphones I 'block' out a lot of people and it can seem very anti-social; it's very easy to forget that important people are around that would like some of your attention too... like say, your spouse ;) For me though this has been really helpful in getting stuff around the house done, and helping me get more learning in, which is always a huge bonus.

So give it a try, find someone podcasts that **REALLY** interest you, whatever they are, and give it a try next time those dishes are really starting to pile up, or that hamper is overflowing, or the litter box needs cleaning, or the lawn needs cutting, or the wife/spouse needs... anything?... well almost anything ;)

**TLDR; Listen to podcasts to help stop procrastination and get chores done!**

Welcome to the first ever mindful Monday. If people like this...I will continue it.

This will be a simple post each week. A thought, meditation instructions, quote. All you need to do is breathe...read...and relax....

Metta is a meditation practice where one calms their mind and radiates love towards themselves, a loved one, a neutral person, and an enemy.

I just finished sitting and practiced the following phrases towards all 7000 members of /r/ADHD:

*May you be happy.*

*May you be safe.*

*May you be healthy.*

*May your body and mind be at ease.*

*May you be focused.*

*May you love yourself completely. Without judgement.*

Repeat x5

*** 

&gt;By practicing Metta meditation, we are creating a skillful habit of mind, one which allows us to soften into the deeper experiences of our lives, the chances to connect with all that is around and within us.... to live more fully. It allows a spaciousness to develop in the mind allowing us to be less reactive, less stressed out, more calm in the face of challenges, losses, injustices.

&gt;At the same time, we are breaking the unskillful habit of mind associated with greed: possessiveness, fear, separateness, hatred. We are moving away from the habits of anger and aversion, rage, despair, disappointment.

Source: http://www.bemindful.org/metta.htm

***

When I started **I was surprised to discover how hard it was to feel this love towards myself** (this is often the case). By practicing again and again, I finally started to break the barriers. Took months. But I finally broke through. You can too.

I suggest doing this via a guided meditation to help you remember the phrases (initially I forgot them often) and keep your mind on track.

[Here is an article on this topic if you're intetested](http://voices.yahoo.com/clothing-sensitivity-adhd-teens-4297965.html) the article mentions teens, but as an adult I continue to have these issues. 

One other thing I'm weird about, if I have been touching a lot of things, like in a grocery store, my hands get this residue feeling, like this sticky almost a ""heaviness"" feeling to them, I always have to wash my hands as soon as I get home if my hands feel this way. And when I cook, I have to wash my hands between every step, I can't wait until the end.

1375118343.0,41,self.ADHD,1jad5d,I don't even feel like a person anymore.,ADD_PI,46,5,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1jad5d/i_dont_even_feel_like_a_person_anymore/,"I'm so sorry to put this here, but I'm so lost I don't know where else to go. 

Currently I'm unmedicated. I'm 26, ADD (PI), with anxiety and depression.

I took Vyvanse for about 3 years in college. The way it made life feel normal, like a livable thing... it was amazing. I no longer had to fight and burn myself out at 140% just to do basic things. I had prescription payment assistance from Shire, so I got my daily doses for free/very little money. 

Then, about a year or two ago, my doctor suddenly decided she was no longer writing the prescription. I was given no warning, and because I was so depressed at the time, I numbly accepted going from daily dosages to nothing at all. Very abruptly.

I struggled so hard. The first few months were just a hazy fog of floating through life trying to make it through the day clinging onto one coherent thought at a time. It was like thrashing around in molasses just to be normal.

After a while I thought I had won. In fact, I got a very impressive job working full time in an environment where everything depended on me to function. I was unbelievably organized to combat the ADD. 

This last year, I've plummeted. The stress has been eating away at everything: I came out of a long term relationship that I thought was forever and have been completely on my own. I haven't had time off in two years but I can't leave this job for many reasons (most of them to do with finances and also lack of other options). I'm overworked and I feel trapped, which only adds to the symptoms of not being able to focus.  

The anxiety is out of control and I can't afford therapy anymore. I'm on Ativan as needed for the times where I feel like the things I have to do are going to swallow me up and I can't handle it, but that sometimes only increases the foggy feeling. 

There's this mental speeding death trap, and while I am actually doing really well at work (to the point that no one knows I have ADD), I feel like I'm killing myself just to stay afloat. **I obsess an unreasonable amount over the things I didn't get done or the things I might have forgotten or overlooked.** 

I could start taking the Vyvanse again (different doctor), but I'm unsure/unable to for a few reasons: 

* If my anxiety isn't related to my ADD, then taking the Vyvanse might make my anxiety/palpitations worse (but I won't know until I try) 

* I barely make enough money to get by (I live alone and have student loans, expenses, etc.) - but I make enough for Shire to refuse help for paying for my meds 

* I think I'm about to lose my job because the company isn't doing well, so taking on another long term revolving expense could be a very bad idea 

* I'm worried about the long term effects of Vyvanse on my health

Then there's the fact that maybe I'm just stupid, lazy, and not worth the effort. I'm a blob that does nothing but expend all energy presenting a normal appearance while slowly slipping away into a pit of doing nothing. 

Outside of work all I have the energy to do is be completely inactive to recuperate from the tremendous amount of energy it took to do what I needed to do during the day. 

I feel like I'm wasting away and this terrifies me because I don't know if anyone else feels likes this because of their ADD. I used to draw, play music, read, and want to learn things ... Now, I feel like my inability to pay attention is burning away my life. 

Or maybe it's worse, and its not the ADD at all. Maybe it's just ...me. I've never felt so dead. 


**TL;DR:** ADD is making me feel like a slug with a racing brain and zero energy to do anything meaningful, since it's so exhausting to stay afloat at work. 

Has anyone else experienced this...?

I work in a publishing office and I have two weekly hard-and-fast deadlines that I have no problems meeting. I know that I am integral to our projects' success. I take great pride in this and LOVE what I do. 

However, my other responsibilities at work fall by the wayside. Other responsibilities like- monthly billing for my department. Filing. Sorting documents. This is where I am trying to focus my effort today, and it is absolutely crushing me.  

I am shaking and I feel disoriented and a bit dizzy. I am ashamed of myself.  I don't know how I let it get so bad, but I have. 

I am so blessed to have an amazing set of coworkers in this organization. There are only 5 of us, and I love them all dearly and couldn't (usually) ask for a better team. None of them ever give me hell for my messy desk, oft-temporarily-misplaced files or any of my other odd quirks. 

The past four years working here, I have always been able to stay mostly on-track every month by dedicating a Saturday and spending the entire day on these things. I put on my headphones and knock out my stuff in a half day and come away feeling mighty and amazing. 

But I haven't done this in months. I keep telling myself that I will ""next weekend"" ... three months later, it hasn't happened. 

I feel like I am drowning and really could use some advice if anybody has any to offer. I see my doctor monthly for my med refill (who is amazing!!) but my next appt is three weeks from today!

I was diagnosed at about age 11 and was medicated for a time, but was off meds for about 6 or 7 years, and just started again earlier this year (I'm 20 now). For years I knew that I was not reaching my potential. Every time I would make mistakes I would say to myself that there would come a time when I would know better, and not make those stupid mistakes, whatever they may be. 

I was lazy, unwilling to find work, or do school assignments. I knew that I could do well enough if I actually tried, but for some reason I never could find the motivation or drive to do the things I needed to do. 

At the start of this past May I began working for my uncle for the third summer in a row. The work is hard and the hours suck. I used to have to listen to music to help move the time along. I would check the time, see that it was 7:30, work for what seemed like an hour, then check the time again only to find that it was 7:33. I would grumble and complain about everything, despite the fact that I was (and still am) making close to $400 a week after taxes. 

Since I've started this summer, though, where I am medicated with 20 mg of amphetamine salts, everything has changed. I now only listen to music for the sake of enjoying it whilst I work and often times just go without. I find that waking up is immensely easier (I was never a coffee drinker so the fact that the drug is a stimulant which ensures I stay awake and alert is a convenient side effect), and the days now pass much faster and I am just so incredibly much more focused on my tasks and hardly ever bother to check the time. I work hard, and I don't bitch and moan about it. There have been other maturity indicators at play here as well, but the primary difference I've noticed is in my work ethic and I wanted to share this with you all as my own little success story. I am grateful that I have this medicine to metaphorically open the door for me to become the man I always knew I could be.

I would also love to hear your guys' success stories, if you've got them!

*Just wanted to remind people to **upvote this post**. Recently, our weekly threads get pushed off the page pretty quick. More upvotes = more wins = more people getting inspired (it is a cycle).*

#####Science behind Win Wednesday (new)

* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.

 * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.

* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field.

 * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**

 * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain.

*I (/u/computerpsych) have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good, let me know if you want more info.*

***

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***

* **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**

* **Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!**

* **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**

***

* The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!

* **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!

***

##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS: (updated 5/1) **FRESH**

* Kept a non-negative attitude even after being laid off. (and subsequently got a great job offer)

* Did my homework. (this is huge for some of us!)

* Went to the disability office and **set up accommodations at university**.

* **Kept anxiety to a minimum**.

*  **Finally went and got diagnosed with ADHD** and started Adderall.

* Learned how to make bullet points on Reddit:p

* **After fighting depression and my ADHD symptoms and trying to find a job for the last year things finally worked out. I managed to get an amazing job offer and am moving to a brand new city in 4 weeks!**

* Started exercising

* Posted in WW for the first time (or on Reddit 1st time).

* Got up on time.

* Finished resume...

* Many many more!

I also took adderall once before for drug purposes when I didn't know I had ADHD, I took too much then I ended up playing Diablo 2 for 4 days straight with maybe 2 hours of sleep.

It also makes sense that the effect of adderall had worn off and when I got to the expansion I had no drive to play it, so I ended up forcing myself to.

I'm not sure whether I can attribute all of them to ADHD, but here goes:

* I can read at breakneck speed so I read a lot, and am one of the best-read people I know.

* I need the stimulation I get from information, and this makes me always seek out new information, learn stuff, try out new experiences

* I have many very different interests, that range from obscure languages to quantum touch to belly dancing. People often admire me for this, though sometimes I'm afraid I'm a ""Jack of all trades...""

* The above points make me interesting in social situations, and help me to deal with my shyness and awkwardness. The disadvantage is that I often find other people boring. But I have:

* A lovely world of fantasies in my head, which I can withdraw to whenever reality around me is meh.

* I'm pretty flexible and spontaneous. I do plan my day in detail, but can adjust very easily if everything goes the other way.

* I can work on several projects at one, with no problem in switching from one to another.

* I can often see the ""big picture"" and spot connections that others miss.

* I love to explore, both places as well as ideas, because I don't like to take the same routes. I often live in a town for a few years and know all the interesting places which the locals aren't aware of.

* I can't tolerate boredom, which means I will never chose to work in a soul-sucking job.

* I switch up things in my life, I have moved across continents, changed my eating style in many ways, etc etc. I will never get stuck in a rut.

* I can pour a lot of love, dedication and attention to something that really grabs my interest.

My doctor reluctantly gave me a Vyvanse prescription. Everyone noticed an improvement. I got and held a job for the first time in my life. I went back to school. It was awesome. While they said it worked best taking it at the same time every day, I didn't do that.

Then I just started double dosing every day and, not to my surprise, I ran out about a week or two before my next refill. I thought I had my routine and confidence down enough to go through my day without it. That I just needed the drug to set my life on track and now I could sail without it. Wrong. So wrong.

I was accepted out of my middle school with an almost full ride scholarship due to my grades and to my standardized testing scores, unfortunately for me, there was something nobody had realized. Ever since I was younger I had always done my homework on the kitchen counter in front of my mother, she would always keep me on track, make sure I was doing my work and generally keeping me right in line with what I was supposed to be doing. 

That all changed when I moved schools, for my Freshman year life was great, I had a 4.0, I played tons of sports and lived a generally exciting and full life. My RA and my House advisor though were always annoyed with me, having to tell me to study frequently bothered them. But the structure of the school did not permit the ability to slack off during my frehsman year. Unfortunately, things changed. 

My sophomore year was a mess, I acheived my lowest grade point ever, and nobody knew why. My teachers had always wrote the same comments as usual, ""Your child is briliant but he has difficulty paying attention in class, etc. etc."" But now they were forced to admit that the grades I was receiving were substandard. Then, one day, things changed. This girl I was dating at the time had a father who was a Psychologist. He was a nice man, kind to everyone he came across, but he was having trouble in his practice. One of the tests they were using to screen for mental disorders were producing an abnormally high instance rate, something he thought was due to weaker standards to prevent people who were a little ""off"" socially from being hit with an Asperger's/Autism diagnosis. He asked me to take one of the tests for him if my parents were cool with it, so I did. 

The next week, he called me, saying that he would like for my parents to take the test for me as well, I called mom and dad, who are both professionals and they agreed to fill out the forms me. I gave my girlfriend's father their number and he called them. I do not know the full details about what happened but the gist is that he told them about my results and asked for them to fill out a Conner's 3 test alongside giving him permission to have my teacher's fill out a set as well. 

The results came back about two weeks after I had officially filled out my tests, and I received another phone call. At this point I had broked up with my now ex-girlfriend but we were still on speaking terms. Meeting up with her dad at a local coffee shop he seemed slightly defeated, like he was tasked with breaking the news to me that something had happened to my family or friends. Luckily, he knew that I was able to read and understand the charts that he showed me and I learned that I have ADD or ADHD. (98th percentile on average for all three categories.) I was perscribed my medication and sent on my way.

Then my life changed at the point, everything that had once taken so much of my will power and my energy took...well...less of it. Reading 25 pages of Plato for school? That was easy, hell, I'll even underline and annotate it for you as well, teach. Gradually my grades began to improve but there was still no hope of slvaging my sophomore year. 

This year though, things are different. I just received my report card back and I am so happy. I have the highest GPA possible for my class load and my standardized test scores put me well on track to be going to my first choice college. My life is so much more fufililng now, it is like going for seeing the world as a video on a TV screen through static to a clean, crisp image. I honestly can say for the first time in a long while that I am excited to go to school, excited to do my homework, and, I am excited to learn about things that do not make me jump for joy.

I've been on Adderall XR for several years and I've found that it works well for me. I usually only take it when I'm working (I work 4 10-12 hour shifts a week, and even then I usually don't take it every day) or if I have some huge project that needs to get done. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was in middle school and I've tried Ritalin and some other prescription but I experienced unpleasant side effects. With Adderall the only side effects I've had are loss of appetite and dry mouth. 

Now I've moved to a different state and I have a new insurance company who referred me to a new psychiatrist. I had a phone consultation with him, and he kept repeatedly saying that he wanted to ""explore non stimulant"" options with me. I told him that I was happy with my current meds and that I didn't want to try a new medication, particularly one that I have to take every day in order for it to work. He just basically shut me down at this point, saying that ""Due to it's addictive potential, Adderall is not intended for long term use."" 
Whenever I tried to advocate for myself, saying that I'd found what worked for me, I have no history of addictions and that I am, historically sensitive to the side effects of medications (including having bad reactions to anti-depressants) he just kept coming back to ""Adderall is addictive."" 

My actual appointment with him is later next week, and I'm wondering if anyone else here has dealt with something like this. It's taken me a long time to finally get an appointment with somebody, and my prescription is going to run out soon. I'd really like to make this work and not have to wait another month or two to go to someone else. Any advise? 

(TL;DR: My new psychiatrist wants me to go on Strattera because Adderall is addictive.

I have tried many things, and found that there is a particular combination which always works best for me. I'm not sure if this is similar to you guys, but thought i'd share anyway.

**How to Start Studying**

This is my personal tried and tested process for a successful session of studying, usually lasting anywhere up to 30 mins - 5+ hours.

	1. Wait until night time (or go somewhere with no/little distractions)
	2. Put in ear plugs
	3. Turn off all computers/electronic devices
	4. Take ADHD medication (have something to eat before/during)
	5. Clear working area of all distractions (empty desk) &amp; get out stationary
	6. Lower temperature of the room so it isn't too hot (more on the cold side)
	7. Get out study materials/books/documents and place them on desk
	8. Write all the things/thoughts that need doing on Wunderlist (or notepad app)
	9. Sit down, put hood over head to block out any remaining distractions and start studying.

Hope you guys find this useful in some way.

edit: 

I should also add that if I take any breaks to go to the bathroom/get food/water etc, I leave my ear plugs in 99% of the time because that way it's easier not to get distracted by things like music/people/TV.

Also, I should clarify, with #8, I actually mean non-work things which are on my mind that may tempt me to run off and do before 'starting' to study. I find it helps clear my mind and lets me focus on what's in front of me.

For example: Watch the great gatsby, Book dentist appointment, Buy a plant for the apartment, enrol in a ballet/hip hop class, buy ""____"" from amazon, call this person, do tax returns etc.

I am 20 years old and last week my psychiatrist diagnosed me with ""moderate ADHD"". Only recently have I been having bad ADHD symptoms so I didn't think it was ADHD. But we discussed family members and my childhood habits and such as well as taking one of those personality tests and he thinks it's definitely ADHD. I was prescribed Adderall and so far I've only taken it for 3 days. Two days on 10mg and one on 20mg. I feel a little more focused but no change in memory.



**Problem:**

So the attention and focus symptoms suck but it's somewhat tolerable. The major problem I am having is my short term memory has gone to shit. This is apparent in my new food service job where people spew out a large order and it takes a while to type it into the register. I forget the second half and ask them to repeat it. I type more stuff in the register and STILL can't remember like the last item they ordered. I have to ask again. Needless to say the customers get very angry and share a few choice words. Then the kitchen people ask me to clarify the order I just punched in and I can't even remember what the customer said, I don't even remember just punching in a special order.  It's really bad. I don't feel like it's an attention problem because I am standing straight, facing them, looking them in the eye and doing my best to listen. I'm not distracted by anything. I am pretty comfortable with the register even though it's confusing, I don't get too stressed about punching stuff in.

**Questions:**

* My question is, is this short term memory problem associated with the ADHD or is it something else?

* If it is ADHD does the medicine help treat memory problems?

* Any other advice is much appreciated, I feel like I'm losing my mind.

Why: I wanted a battery of tests done so my doctors or I wouldn't be left guessing if it was ADHD or not. 

How: 3 Days of testing. 
    1) Several computerized visual/audio tests
    2) WISC-IV
    3) Review of elementary school grades and notes from teachers
    4) Several observation sessions where I read, solved puzzles, and performed various other tasks

Results: Documentation from the doctor stating the process of tests done, results, and recommendations. The documentation would of allowed me for more time on tests and an environment to limit distractions. This is not to be intended to share with employers, co-workers, or colleagues. I keep my diagnosis to myself and share with a select few because those that don't have ADHD may have a hard time understanding.

I've always thought I grew up with social anxiety. I've been using that excuse forever when I'm in new social situations, whether it's a job interview, starting a new job, or meeting a new group of people. Suddenly today I started thinking that it isn't anxiety that is stopping me from being a great communicator, but ADHD. I'm predominantly inattentive, so I don't have the problem of speaking over someone or blurting things out inappropriately, but I can NEVER seem to carry on a conversation. I give one word answers, and half ass my reactions to the stories I'm being told. Sometimes I struggle to look the other person in the face and I'm always looking for any excuse to walk away or talk about something else. My good friend once told me she could tell when I was phasing out, and knew to wrap up her stories and talk about something else.

I had a moment a few days ago where this became more obvious. I met a new person at work. He seemed really interesting and I was laughing and carrying on with him almost immediately. I was medicated that morning and I was carrying on a great conversation. Fast forward to lunch time when I need to take my second dose and I realize I forgot my meds. Our conversations from that point onward were short and uninteresting. My responses were ""mhmm"", ""sure"", ""interesting!"", and I couldn't look him in the face and looked for any way to do something else. It was like a night and day difference. I wonder now just how much of my past, shitty social life was from being nervous around people, or if I was ""anxious"" as a way of dealing with an inability to effectively communicate. 

It's just crazy to identify as a certain type of person, and then suddenly realize that you might not have ever been that person! But this is awful too, because 3 months ago I had a job interview. I wasn't given the job, so I followed up with them on how I could have made the interview go better. They said I was one of the top candidates but seemed less confident, not as interested in the job as some of the others, and quite fidgety. I wasn't medicated at the time. Now knowing all of this, I understand that my confidence is effected because I KNOW I have a hard time speaking effectively (not because I'm afraid to talk to them), which I'm sure made me seem uninterested and more anxious. If only I had been medicated 3 months ago, I would be living in a new city, meeting new people, and working for a fortune 100 company.

The only downside is that sometimes I zone out while listening to the voice and have to rewind a bit -- but not nearly as much as I do without the reader.

If you have a Mac, then your computer already has decent screen reading software built-in. You can access it from the preference panel and choose between a variety of voices and speeds.

If you're on Windows it's a bit trickier. Windows also has a built in screen reader but it's not very good. I personally use Ivona MiniReader which has a free 30 day trial and the voices sound very natural (some more than others).

On that note if anyone has any recommendations for free, good quality screen readers please let me know! My free trial of Inova MiniReader ended a few weeks ago and I can't afford to buy it right now. :(

*When I first started with a coach I gave her 30 things I wanted to do. But, she helped me realize I couldn't do those unless I was sleeping enough **consistently** each night. Playing video games right before bed was decreasing my quality of sleep. So the first thing I did was create a bedtime routine.* **Today YOU get to plan your ideal evening routine (or try to strengthen a current one).** - computerpsych

# Examples:  
* **Intense enough exercise in the evening**--after which I don't expect to cogitate too heavily.  =P

* **Getting all my ""things to do"" out of my head.**  
  * I use *[Kick-Start Sunday (KSS)](http://redd.it/19kdo0)* because then I can't lose the list.  =P
  * I also keep a notebook or pad of sticky notes bedside with a pen, and use the light from my cell or ipod (aimed only at the paper) rather than turning on a lamp.

* **Developing a bedtime routine** so your brain starts to think about unwinding in advance.  
  * **Take bedtime medications or supplements, if applicable.  Drink some water either way.**  *(They take time to 'kick in', so it's good to remember to do this about 30 minutes before your planned bedtime.)*  **Set a timer for this.**  
  * **Make Overnight Oatmeal](http://www.theyummylife.com/Refrigerator_Oatmeal)** so I have grab and go breakfast in the morning.
  * **Clean sink for 5 minutes: gather dirty dishes from everywhere, and load dishwasher or wash dishes.**  (Unload clean dishwasher first, if applicable.)  Otherwise, wash your dishes or make sure all other non-dishwasher or unwashed dishes are stack *outside* of the sink.  *(Then you have space to work on breakfast or cleaning in the morning.)*
  * **Shower.**  I shower at bedtime, because then I'm not as rushed in the morning.  Being a bit damp afterwards helps your body *cool down* which is a 'time for sleep' trigger.  I usually do a quick 'rinse' shower in the morning as well (≤1-2 min.) as it's a 'wakeup' trigger for me.
  * Then in bed, **read an enjoyable, pleasant book or use guided meditation/relaxation**.

* Try **meditation, yoga, or guided relaxation** like this online free *[Relax with Andrew Johnson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzsV6ZwZvlQ)*, or the free mobile app version.  
  * I'm bad at meditation, and find it difficult to stay on track with a self-guided bedtime yoga routine, but this seems to work.  It's **not New-Agey** and **he sounds like Billy Connolly!  =P**

I feel like I'm on a hamster wheel and every time I notice I'm not going anywhere, I start running harder with no results. In the meantime I've had the worst anxiety and depression.

I look at all the successful people around me, and how I'm not one of them. I can't take feeling like I'm smart, but a total failure. I won't get into finer details, but lets just say I can't get out of bed in the morning to even care about taking my medication.

We decided to start a new weekly thread on Fridays in an attempt to consolidate the frequent “beginner” questions and introductions into one place. After discussing this in our [/r/ADHD chatroom](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/ADHD) the conclusion is that we must **address the increase in basic questions posted in /r/adhd and decrease the use of our subreddits FAQ (due to the limits in reddit’s wiki system which will be improved very soon now and we will take full advantage of this once released).  


Of course, anyone can post a question, but this thread is especially geared toward people who **think they might have ADHD, have just been diagnosed, have questions about whether to medicate (or not), or to determine if something you are experiencing is a side-effect of a medication or not.**, etc. 

## Also, if you’re new to our little community, (or even if you’re not and you just want to do this anyway!) this is the place to say hello!! 

*By the way, these threads are going to help build /r/ADHD’s FAQ page, the current version of which can be found [here!](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/ADHD)*

**So, to get to the point of this thread, allow me to introduce /r/ADHD's first introductory and basic question thread!**

* Listen to music.
* Watch **one** show on TV.
* Surf the web.
* Read a book or magazine.
* Fix a snack.
* Exercise.
* Take a bath.
* A ‘more liked’ task.

##### II.  Use naturally occurring reinforcers.
If you prefer talking to people over writing memos, write a memo first *then* allow yourself to make a needed call to a colleague.

##### III.  Pair aversive tasks with pleasurable ones.
# *Examples:*
* Exercise while watching TV, a video, or listening to music.
* Curl up in a comfortable chair to read a business document.
* Clean house to your favorite energetic music.
* Wipe counters or load the dishwasher while talking to a friend on the phone.
* Otherwise simplify a difficult task -- use online bill-pay or use TurboTax for your taxes.

##### IV. Partner with someone to do the task.
* Work on the task with with someone you live with--wash windows together.
* Work on complementary tasks with someone--two tasks in the same room, such as sweeping the kitchen and loading the dishwasher.
* Set up study dates with friends to work on your separate subjects next to each other.

It's interesting how many of the effects on Wednesday were more about the side effects than the primary, positive effects. There's none of the euphoria, nerves, hyperfocus, or shortness of breath that I noticed. In fact, for a while I thought that the meds weren't even working because I had been primed by what happened on Wednesday to expect so much more.

I can act, instead of just react.

So all-in-all, pretty fantastic. I don't feel like I've changed - I just feel like I'm more me.

## HEY GUYS! READ THIS. We have a suggestion for something new we’re trying with formatting lately! When you list your accomplishments, pick your #1 Win and post that one in BOLD! This is to help communicate to the rest of us which Win you're most proud of, and also to help you reflect on the gravity of your accomplishments!**

NOTE: I’ve been excited to see a handful of posts popping up this past week, talking about belated or early Win Wednesday! It’s awesome that you guys are eager to share your accomplishments here! Again, you can totally post in WW all week long, but making a separate post is fine too!

Here's what I've started doing:
Step 1) Make list the night before on what I'm going to accomplish the next day. I write what time I'm going to do everything at and what time I'm going to stop. I consider this ""class time"" meaning attendance is mandatory and I'll feel super guilty if I don't follow it. (If you do this, be generous with your time. Assume it will take longer to do each task than it will. Also, give yourself plenty of leisure time if you can afford it, especially closer to the end of the day when your meds are wearing off and when you're just more tired in general.) 

2) I've heard people call this ""brain priming."" I've created a mantra and I recite it to myself before I write everyday. It's ""Work harder. Work longer. Work stronger."" Or just Harder, Longer, Stronger. I think the double entendre is funny. But I associate these words with doing work. I never say them to myself when I'm not doing work. After only a few days, I found myself feeling more motivated and ready to write when I hear those three words together. Say them out loud. Say them in your head.

So, just wondering-- do other ADHD people (especially women) have similar problems learning social signalling? I actually needed people to sit me down and explain it to me before I got it.

And no, social signalling doesn't mean 'hiding the real you...' as much as... giving visual cues that don;t scare people off before they get a chance to know the real you.

So, is this an ADHD thing? My Aspie friends were actually BETTER at this, because once they learned the rules, they could stick with them. Whereas, it took me years to learn to apply rules like ""wash your face and comb your hair before you leave the house.""

I am 28, diagnosed with ADHD 5 years ago and take a very proactive / self aware approach to my ADHD.  I work as a marking director in a mental health clinic so I am surrounded by support and information.

I have been doing REALLY WELL lately when it comes to managing my ADHD.  I have kept a clean enough apartment that I can invite people over.

This weekend I met my girlfriends sister/brother in law.  This was a stressful event and I did my best to keep my ADHD in check.  I was good in conversation, didn't talk in to many tangents, and none of them would have suspected I have ADHD.  After being home for 1 day I am crashing!

1367646922.0,37,self.ADHD,1do039,"What having ADHD is like, an analogy... With cats.",Endlssmmr85,53,16,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1do039/what_having_adhd_is_like_an_analogy_with_cats/,"I wrote this in response to a ""what does ADHD feel like"" post.  It became long and I liked writing it so I decided to give it it's own post.  I hope you like it too.

Imaging a normal brain is like a giant shipping and receiving warehouse, such as Amazon or USPS.  In a normal warehouse, packages (information) come in and some one is ready to sort and move the the item to its proper place to be ready to be shipped.  This is usually efficient and when there is a rush of packages people are ready to sort as fast as possible to prevent the system from backing up.  When an item is ready to be shipped someone it has been properly catalogued and can be easily found.

Now, remove all of the workers and replace them with a team of intelligent yet indifferent cats (because this is reddit and it seems to fit well).  These cats know they have to do a job, and they can manage simple tasks as long as it is routine.  When a rush of packages comes in the cats, lacking opposable thumbs, cannot move packages quickly and they are indifferent, so they don't care where things go, or even if the package has proper postage, or if it is even a package at all.  It could be someones shoe that was left in the wrong place or a flickering light in the corner of your eye or ""hey, I didn't notice that bit of dirt on the corner of this paper I've been looking at for the last hour."" When these random bits come in they throw off the already poor system because the cats get confused as to what to do with them since they tend to wobble on the shelves and are, for some reason, more interesting than the packages.  On top of that the pile of other packages is growing bigger and bigger and the cats that aren't looking at the different wobbly object can't keep up.  The only way to correct this is to stop taking in packages for a little while and let the bottle neck that was caused get sorted.

Sometimes these cats start getting packages they really like to sort out.  For some odd reason these packages are really easy to sort.  So easy that all they want to do is sort these specific packages and ignore all the others.  The others get dropped off at the front door because all the other mail slots for different packages are closed because the cats aren't interested.  Sometimes the mailman knocks really loudly, because his packages are important and need to get sorted, and the cats open the eye slot to see what he wants but it's never really as interesting as what they were doing so they will half ass the mailmans job to make him slightly happy but ultimately get back to the fun packages.

In a warehouse such as this things are easily lost, misplaced, forgotten, and pushed back on the shelves to make room for other things that don't necessarily go there but seem to fit and the other thing wasn't wobbling much any more so it must not be important.  When something is needed to be found, it's much harder to locate, being that the cats don't have a complex vocabulary and tend to find other things that wobble or twitch or stand out more, but since all the cats are looking it gets found and used properly.

I can continue the analogy with teaming the cats up with well trained dogs (meds) but this is getting long and I need to be up early, so if people show their love I will continue.

Tl;dr I relate what adhd is like by comparing a well organized shipping warehouse to one that is staffed by cats.

1365730527.0,41,self.ADHD,1c6eii,Oh the irony: I have ADHD and I work as a project manager. Here's how I stay afloat.,develdevil,53,12,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1c6eii/oh_the_irony_i_have_adhd_and_i_work_as_a_project/,"To be completely honest, being a PM is the last thing I ever wanted and I don't think I am very good at the actual project management aspects of my job. Still, here I am. And I am making the most of it. Why did I come to be a PM? Well, there are about 100 times more job openings for project managers than there are for product managers, so I just sort of fell into it when recruiters started sending me job descriptions that matched my skills.

If you read down the symptoms of ADHD, you can imagine how we would make absolutely terrible project managers. Forgetfulness, lack of organization, distraction, avoiding projects, can't finish projects, changing plans... the perfect storm of incompetence. I have a few tricks that help me out, but it's still a pain in the ass.

1) Take notes. Never rely on your memory.

I lost my first project manager job because I would show up to meetings without a note pad, thinking I could recall and retain everything I needed to, simply because I was smart and the subject matter was benign. I was so absolutely wrong. It started with me zoning out during meetings. Then, when called upon for input, I wouldn't know heads or tails of anything because my mind was blank. Afterwards, I couldn't remember what happened at the meeting because it was boring. I eventually wised up and started taking meticulous notes, but I had already lost the confidence of my superiors.

2) Use Evernote for more than just notes.

Besides organizing your thoughts and projects, the best thing about Evernote is its to-do list feature. My entire day is dictated by one long, evolving to-do list. Boss asks you to figure something out? To-do. Get an idea that you want to look into after you're done with something? To-do. Have a question you want to ask someone when you see them? To-do. Check off the box when you're done and prune out your completed tasks at the end of the day. The best part? Snap out of the 15 minute trance you just slipped into and don't know what to do? Check the list.

3) Wear many hats.

I may be a project manager by title, but I also work in a tiny company with only 3 other people. In the past, I've worked in large corporations where my only job duties were focused on managing projects. There were no blurred lines. I wanted to gouge my eyes out. In my current position, I am much more to the company than just a crank turner. I do tech support. I solve programming problems. I strategize business tactics. I write articles for the company blog. This diversification of activities makes the boring parts easier to bear, knowing that something interesting is waiting right around the corner.

4) Own your projects.

Most companies just want their project managers to be freelance shepherds. I suffered from an acute lack of giving a shit about those projects. At my current job, every project has an underlying goal that I've given it. I have enough say over the procedures and tactics involved to where the decisions I make can really have a difference. On one of my current projects, I've given myself a goal to complete it using 25-50% labor than the previous one. Having this goal has gotten me more invested in it. Sometimes I actually feel like I'm managing it instead of reacting to it.

I just want to add that I refuse to take medication. It changed my personality too much. I used to take it... all the way up to my sophomore year of high school. I went off it and my grades plummeted. I dropped out of HS after the first semester of my senior year. But I became a much more interesting person, so there's that.",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,1365730789.0,,,True,t3_1c6eii,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1c6eii/oh_the_irony_i_have_adhd_and_i_work_as_a_project/,

I was diagnosed with ADHD in October 2011. I was one month away from turning 18 years old. I was a freshman in college at the University of Maryland. Today, I'm at community college in my hometown, 19 years old, dating my college boyfriend, and figuring out how to get myself into the world with this diagnosis that kind of rocked my world. Don't get me wrong, it makes perfect sense. So it kind of rocked my world that the menagerie of therapists and psychiatrists I was already seeing had never picked up on it, leaving me to grow up in a world that was constantly telling me I was lazy, crazy or stupid, and changing medications every 3 months for my ball of anxiety and depression. I was never medicated for my brief bought with bulimia, because I never told anyone. Through the past year of my own research, I've come to conclude that all of my existing problems were caused by my severe, undiagnosed ADHD. 

Now, I'm writing a research paper about the effects of ADHD on women for my English class. Specifically, I argue that 1. women and girls with ADHD are underdiagnosed because of society's expectations for them based on gender, and that 2. society's expectations then lead to worse outcomes for women with ADHD-- specifically, shame, self-harm, and accompanying anxiety and depression. But, 3. because they aren't as often diagnosed, they are put at a distinct disadvantage for addressing the problems. 

If you want to learn about girls and women with ADHD, this is a fascinating place to start: http://www.chadd.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Attention_Magazine&amp;Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=26707

I set 3 goals for myself this summer, and failed all of them miserably. Even with the adderall, I just couldn't get into the productive mindset. I know the adderall works, last semester I did fantastic grade-wise. I can also focus on leisurely activities, which didn't happen much pre-adderall.

But I just don't get the point if I can't even do 3 things that I WANTED to do over the summer.

Goal 1) Learn the first 100 ish kanji from my old japanese book. I made flashcards for about 60 and never once looked at them / finished making flashcards for the rest

Goal 2) Learn the basics of sanskrit. I didn't even finish learning the alphabet

Goal 3) start getting in shape. Amount of times gone jogging / working out? 0.

College starts back up in 2 days, and I just realized the above and felt the urge to rant, so I apologize for it. feels baaaaaaaaaaad man.


Hopefully once classes start, I'll get back in the productive mindset and I can finish those goals up before the year-end.

-edit- Thanks for the advice guys! I did the whole 10 sit ups / 10 pushups thing that Dolmen suggested. Hopefully I'll stick with it. I also filled up the bathtub, took in my notebook and Japanese workbook, soaked for an hour or so while working. Worked really really damn well! Nothing else to distract me, other than maybe getting too comfy in the warm goodness.

Also its not the actual learning that is giving me problems, or focusing (the adderall helps in that regard), it's the actually doing it part. Even if I had one goal, if that goal wasn't ""PLAY ALL THE VIDEO GAMES"", well... I didn't do much this summer other than that. the ESV season ended early on so I lost all responsibilities to be productive to be quite honest.

What qualifies as a disorder, and what qualifies as an appropriate mental response to stimulus? These are the questions that I come back to time and time again, and I'd like to have a discussion in ADHD.

I've been diagnosed with ADHD since I was in elementary school, and yet there is one thing I could never reconcile with myself. I'm a firm believer in the concepts of will power and discipline, and yet those seem to be the problems directly facing those who suffer from ADHD. Now it is a scientific fact that will power and discipline can be altered and improved with practice; where, then, do we draw the line for ADHD?

At what point does ADHD stop being a case of laziness and discipline and start being a disorder? Is it a disorder when your actions make you unhappy and harm your life? Does that make any of the weaknesses that we succumb to as humans a disorder? To create a broad definition of disorder is to remove the ability to make mistakes. Nothing is a mistake; why would we do it if we knew it would harm us? Yet I think we can all agree that mistakes are a part of life and not a malfunction of the brain. 

Where, then, do we draw the line for ADHD? What measurable context is there to determine that something is wrong? Perhaps a physical sign of an underdeveloped brain? I facilitate this conversation because I feel that this subreddit has become a place to discuss weaknesses and mistakes rather than the disorder of ADHD. So, r/ADHD, where do you draw the line? What, specifically, makes ADHD a disorder, and not just a conquerable weakness?

Because of my ADHD I have a tough time staying on task and I frequently have a strange sense of time. When I hyperfocus, I can lose hours in the blink of an eye. (Browsing Reddit, or searching something ""interesting"" on the Internet, for example.)

To combat this, I have a couple of tools I use.

For my home computer, I have a little desktop app called ""Free Desktop Timer"". It's just a tiny window with a digital timer you can set, and 3 buttons: Start, Reset, Close.

Since I work from home most days, I use the timer on my home computer to ensure I get my work done, but also to keep me on task. I set the timer probably 10-15 times a day. For instance, I'll set it for 10 minutes ""goof off time"" (what I'm doing now, 6:23 left). Once that's up, I might set it for 5 minutes ""house"" time where I spend five minutes cleaning up my office or around the house. Then I'll set it for 30 minutes of ""work"" time, during which I'm not allowed to switch over to my home computer, or get up from my chair. 100% focused on work.

I do this throughout the day, and I find that when I'm dedicated to work fully, I get twice as much done as when I'm just half assedly screwing around and get a ""hey! I should look this up on the Internet!"" idea.

Another use for me is the kitchen timer downstairs on the oven. I set it whenever I sit down on the couch to browse for maybe 15 minutes. Then I set it again for 10 minutes ""cleaning"" time. When I have to empty the dishwasher I set it for 6 minutes. My thought process is, ""I can do anything for six minutes."" I now know it takes 6 minutes or less to empty the dishwasher, because it almost always does. Knowing it's only 6 minutes makes me procrastinate less. And it makes emptying the dishwasher into a race against the clock.

Anyway, if you aren't using timers yet to help reset your focus, I highly recommend them! They're working for me!

Edit: 2:55 left to browse then it's back to work! ",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,False,,ORANGE,True,t3_1gnn6e,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1gnn6e/tip_using_timers_as_tools/,

(this really is about ADHD, it just might take me a while to get around to that. Also, standard wall of text apology- skim the bold text for the tl/dr)

**I'm a 35 year old single male, and I have what can only be described as a shopping addiction**, which I've suffered with for all of my adult life. In my case, it's electronics of all kinds. I own several, top of the line computers, tablets, phones TV's etc. 

**I am $30,000 in deb**t- in addition to having burned through an additional $50,000 in savings, over about the last 10 years. 

**For a long time I've thought it was a compulsion**. There is a new phone, and I MUST have it. I NEED that new macbook pro. Kind of like OCD (which I'm sure is related somehow). But lately I think I've started to understand it better.

A typical buying experience - this summer my laptop died. I need a laptop (need, right!). There are a lot of options out there for laptops, most in the $300-$500 range. My research started there. It ended up on apple.com, slowly progressing from a macbook air to a low end macbook pro to a fully decked out mac book pro. But it wasn't enough to order it online - I ended up driving an hour in to the 'big city' to buy one **right now**- $2,300 on the credit card.

**Like someone with ADHD trying to deal with procrastination, I've tried all of the 'tricks'**. Cutting up your credit cards (I have the numbers memorized), automatic savings (saving $100 is just justification to spend $1,000), budget (no fucking way), but it just didn't work. 

Two months ago, I started on medication for my ADHD and I've had some success controlling my spending. **Much like an alcoholic who has to stay away from the bars &amp; pubs (actually, I'm that as well), if I stay out of stores I'm mostly OK**. The only store I can handle visiting on a regular basis is the grocery store (although even that can be dangerous at times). March was the first month in probably 10 years that I spent less money than I made. 

**Then last week I had an interesting experience.** I was researching and pricing web servers. Why? I don't need to buy a web server, I already lease a high end server in a data centre that's way more powerful than I need. But here I am pricing out servers, strarting with $139 used rack-mount servers and progressing from there to low-end servers, up to $2,000 custom built from scratch servers &amp; $3,000 dell servers. 

**I was close to buying, and then I realized that feeling that I've had all along. I used to think it was anxiety, but it's not.** That feeling that I get when I'm researching - seriously - something.  Especially something that's high-end, expensive, and costs way more than what I have in my bank account. That feeling that I'm special or important because I'm buying something better than a 'normal' person would by. The fantasy of what my life would be like with this new thing. 

**It was an adrenaline rush. I literally get high off of shopping.** I am literally addicted to spending more money than I have on stuff that I don't need. 

One of the symptoms that come along with ADHD is 'risky behaviour' - thrill seeking or being an adrenaline junkie. This is my risky behaviour, and it's ruining my life - just like being an alcoholic was. **I haven't had a drink for almost six months, but let me tell you it's much, much harder not to buy a new cell phone then it is to go to the bar and only drink coke.** 

But the medication helps, and so does understanding how my brain works. And staying the hell out of stores, and bars. And it's slowly getting better, just like the rest of my life has been since I was diagnosed with ADHD. 

Anyway, just sharing. Motivation, procrastination &amp; forgetfulness isn't the only way ADHD affects us. **Money isn't something we talk about very often, and getting high by spending it certainly isn't. I'd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, or comments**

I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI halfway through last semester, and am now taking 40mg Adderall daily (20mg XR in the morning, 20mg IR in the afternoon). I failed all my classes last semester because it took two months to get accurately diagnosed, and another three months to find an effective dose/learn how to deal with my symptoms.**

Now I'm worried I'm going to fail all my classes again this semester. I just got put on academic probation, and I had to file an appeal to maintain federal student loans.

At the start of this semester, I felt ready and prepared. Services for Students with Disabilities accommodated me by allowing me to take 8 credit hours instead of the minimum 12. My mom thought this would help me focus. I mean, really, how hard should it be to make up a few classes I've already taken plus one new one?

Well, it turns out it's pretty fucking difficult for me. I buckled under the perceived pressure, and even though this workload is supposed to be easier, I'm stressing out more now than ever. Within the first week of the semester (about a month ago), I stopped attending class because I started falling behind and wanted to avoid ridicule from peers/teachers. This is the first time I've told anyone about not going. My parents don't know; my closest friends don't even know that. Now I'm way too behind to even know what to do.

I slept through a political science test monday, and I think I have a physics exam today, but I'm not prepared. I feel even less focused now than I did before the diagnosis. And anxious. And depressed. I feel like a failure. A fuck up. A waste of space.

The worst is when my peers give me shit for being like this. People think I'm lazy because I can't for the life of me bring myself to do the simplest of things (just dragging myself to class, even with a reduced load). They give me shit for thinking I need Adderall to do things normal people do.

I really am at wit's end. I have no clue what to do. I'm lost, and scared, and stressed. I don't know what to do...

**TL;DR: I've failed/currently am failing a bunch of classes. I can't motivate myself worth shit. My sleep schedule is completely fucked, and my diet sucks. I know what I'm doing wrong, but I can't fix it for some reason. I need help. If I don't get my shit together, I'll be forced to drop out of college and begin paying back my massive debt.**

**edit 1:** Thank you for the support/advice so far! I'm glad knowing I'm not alone. I think my biggest problem is my unhealthy lifestyle, which is a result of stress, which is a result of my unhealthy lifestyle. **Does anyone have tips on sleeping better or eating healthy?** I think before I can move forward, I need to fix the basics. It's no surprise my ADHD symptoms are worse when I'm starved of both nutrients and rest

**Edit 2:** r/ADHD, I really can't believe the support you've all shown me. I feel encouraged and motivated. I haven't been real with myself which is why I'm in this rut. *when you can no longer hide, you must swallow your pride.* I plan on taking a medical incomplete for my political science class and purely focus on acing my physics class + lab. I'm meeting with my doctor, my life coach, my counselor, and my adviser next week. I'm also emailing my profs to meet IRL to talk with them. I'm gonna drag my ass to class and make an effort to make up old work--even if I don't get credit. I must thank you all for helping me with this crisis.

1351009362.0,43,self.ADHD,11yawe,Adult ADHD - Before &amp; After Vyvanse Perspective,ameangreenbean,46,3,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11yawe/adult_adhd_before_after_vyvanse_perspective/,"Today is my fourth day on Vyvanse. I'm now taking 70mg as prescribed. The only side effect I'm experiencing is a substantial decrease in appetite. As a compulsive over eater for decades this is welcomed. Keep in mind I'm 44 and weigh 340 pounds.

What I want to share today are the differences in my life before and after the medication after just a few days on the medication.

The biggest difference I notice is that I can concentrate for long periods of time on work, conversation or pleasurable activities (Reddit) for extended lengths of time. Prior to medication I could only concentrate for extended lengths of time (2-4 hours) on things I was HIGHLY interested in (highly stimulating activities or content).

Highly stimulating activities for me were things I was interested in and obsesses over it for weeks until I lost interest or will power. I won't bore you with a long list of things I've been ""into"" and a few weeks later quit. It's enough to say that my original diagnosis was Bipolar Type 2. After obsessing over the activity I'd fall into minor depression for a few days and then I'd be just damn grumpy until I found another activity to keep my interest.

Prior to Vyvanse, I struggled to concentrate and complete activities that were not highly stimulating. I would work on them for a few minutes and then lose track of what I was doing, or I'd simply get bored with it and do something else more entertaining. Over time I learned to intentionally procrastinate so that I had no choice but to complete the work or I'd suffer negative consequences. This strategy was only really effective at work as other areas of my life didn't have significant negative consequences. For example, nothing bad really happened if I was late mowing the lawn.

Medicated I simply sit down and start working and can do so for hours at a time. My mind is clear and less affected by distractions. I need to manage distractions as a normal person would of course. It's hard for anyone to concentrate with sirens wailing, horns honking, kids screaming etc.

I can also multitask more efficiently. I'm on conference calls regularly (as I am now while typing this). Prior to meds when listening to a call and writing reports or analyses I would physically stop and find my self lost not knowing what I had just been doing seconds before. Was I listening to the call? Was I writing? My mind could not keep two activities in play at the same time. Medicated this is not a problem at all.

One last observation the I find amazing is that I'm no longer irritable, grumpy or depressed. I'm interested to see if this continues in the long term.

I hope this is helpful. I'll write another post in a few weeks.",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,False,,,True,t3_11yawe,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11yawe/adult_adhd_before_after_vyvanse_perspective/,

Any help?",hugaroundtheneck,40,1,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11w4mo/sometimes_i_feel_guilty_about_using_meds_or_feel/,"I was diagnosed not too long ago, after my first year of college. My life was getting...hectic, before I went. It seemed like it was just out of control, couldn't keep up with anything living on my own (one morning I woke up and realized I couldn't remember the last time I had brushed my teeth), coupled with the stress of finals I knew I had to do something. I had been concerned since I randomly took an adhd quiz online when I was like 15 and it came back saying I had a 97% chance of having adhd. But, I was a typical late diagnosis story, not great grades in hs but really good test scores. I felt like since I was smart/not failing everything I was just trying to blame my laziness on something. I told my Mom about it, she was supportive, I got diagnosed and put on stimulants. 

They have helped a ton this school year. I live in an apartment and for the most part have everything together, and have been getting good grades and been able to study for the first time in my life. I finally feel like I can do things. 


But, for some reason sometimes I feel guilty about taking medicine, I feel like its unfair or something. And sometimes I feel like I'm secretly just really lazy or something, and tried to blame it on something. I think part of it is that I would bring up ADHD to a lot of my friends in high school and they would dismiss me or wouldn't believe me which made me feel like I was being dramatic, and that I always see these news things about people just getting adhd meds, and college students and stuff, that don't actually have adhd, and how everyone always says its over diagnosed etc.

I'm thirty eight years old, and have suffered unmedicated with ADD for my entire life. In my day they classified the symptoms as just being a little shit and not wanting to do what your told. About a year ago I got on Metadate CD with an ever increasing dose (Kaiser does everything slow). Same problems with medications everyone else has with getting used to it, and doctors complaining about my ability to adapt to drugs quickly. I had friends and family notice the changes first which made them very happy that symptoms were going away. Friends actually asked if I was okay due to not talking five thousand miles per hour, or having much in the way of scatterbrained conversations. Fast forward a year and some change and my medical insurance poofed, which also made medication poof since no script no drugs. 
I tried to use homeopathic remedies with nearly any combination I could find but most didn't work. Now I'm attending University which puts my mind under heavy load constantly. The weird thing is the more I work, the more symptoms seem to arise due to the added stress. 

Okay so I do nerdy stuff with friends sometimes, when my inner introvert or fear of offending others with my symptoms doesn't make me go full cave-dweller. When I do go out sometimes my symptoms are bad, which to others I guess is both amusing and fun to watch. I have tried to explain that teasing and complaining will not solve the issue but it reaches deaf ears. 

Sometimes it just seems like people are naturally mean. Its not like you can turn a switch and stop being annoying, or really want to go into a crowded bar (for me lots of people makes me very uncomfortable). Having a group of people you have known for years laugh at you because what sounds logical out of your mouth, is completely unintelligible to them just irks the living shit out of me. Them being angry at tics or repetitive noises or knee bobbing is irritating twice over since I didn't notice it, and now a group of people are pissed at my ""failure to stop it"".

1342835505.0,39,self.ADHD,wwlao,To those of you using the Pomodoro Technique (and not getting as much as you thought out of it),TheWobble,43,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/wwlao/to_those_of_you_using_the_pomodoro_technique_and/,"For starters, if you're subscribed to /r/ADHD and somehow haven't heard of the beautifully-simple tomato timer system, here's a browser-based app and basic description: [focus booster](http://www.focusboosterapp.com/the-pomodoro-technique). The gist of it is that your brain (and if you're here, *your* brain in particular) becomes less effective if it tries to focus on too many things at once. One way to help overcome this is by using the Pomodoro Technique - 25 minute increments of absolute concentration on a task, followed by 5 minutes of relaxation.

This technique helped me a lot...at first. But I soon noticed that the 5 minute breaks were sapping my concentration so severely that it felt like I was starting from scratch every time the 25 minute work cycle rolled around. 

If you're like me and find this happening more often than you'd like, then you might also benefit by changing one very important aspect: *how you spend those 5 free minutes.* I would always work for the first part and get really into it, but as soon as the break came, I would be on 3 different Reddit pages and compulsively reloading my email. I was trying to bottle all the things that distracted me into that 5 minute break, then expect to magically refocus once time was up. It didn't work very well.

The game-changer was when I finally abandoned the notion that I could have it all (Liz Lemon style) and instead started using that 5 minutes to further sharpen my focus (Jack Donaghy style). Rather than flip through links and wall posts for 5 minutes, I started closing my eyes and meditating. Meditation might not be your thing, but the critical part is that you use the break as ***a break from any stimulus whatsoever***. 

Go ahead and try it. Next Pomodoro break, resist the urge to load Reddit. Close your eyes, focus on your breathing, and give your brain time to cool down. No internal monologue, no daydreaming, just...relax. The time will fly by, and once the 5 minutes are up, you'll find starting work again to be far easier. To use a running analogy - it's the mental equivalent of spending 5 minutes slowing down and catching your breath between laps, while mindless surfing with those minutes is like suddenly stopping on the track to do jumping jacks.

Good luck!

**EDIT:** As a few people mentioned, the ""trick"" isn't to sit still and space out for the break, but to avoid giving your brain additional distractions inbetween work cycles. Meditation, playing an instrument, stretching, getting a glass of water...anything that you can focus on without actually processing new information.

Since ADHD effectively limits your frontal lobes, reducing your ability to control yourself and motivate yourself, doesn't ADHD in effect make you less able to be anything but yourself?

For instance, if you're not very good at math, but you have to do it anyway, ADHD will certainly obstruct that goal far more than a normal person, who could ""grin and bear it"". We are bound towards the things we like to do, and we have a hard time accomplishing the things that don't interest us.

It also tampers with our ability to control our emotions. An angry person is much more liable to get angry when he has ADHD, and the same goes to all other emotions. 

I was wondering why I had a sort of distaste for taking medicine. I always felt like I was copping out somehow, even though it's a necessary evil, and now I know why I feel that way. ADHD makes you unable to be anything but exactly who you are. You can't lie to your brain and your most basic motivations and desires.

I realize that in our society this is a hindrance, and everybody has to struggle with things they don't want to do, and that's why ADHD is such a debilitating disorder.

I am grateful for the empathy, but honestly I have no idea what to ask for. I usually just try to ""work through it"" and deal with looming deadlines as they come. I'm not in a position to ask for my own office (though that would be sweet) or to ask to work in the evenings (too many meetings in the mornings).

The other day my doctor noticed an irregular heart beat, so I had an echo-cardiogram done. The results weren't too good.. I basically have [Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy). As a result, she took me off of Adderall, which she explained that because it's a stimulant, it's a very bad thing to be taking with HCM.

So, I come to you amazing people once more.. My question: Does anyone know of any natural supplements, remedies, herbs, whatever, that can replace my Adderall, or at the very least help me retain my focus and concentration..? Finals are coming up real soon, and I've gotten good grades for the first time in the 2+ years I've been in college, would hate to fall back into my failing habits on the finals..

They diagnosed me with ADD and Depression.  I am currently trying Vyvanse 30mg and Celexa 20mg.  I have been on the medication 4 days now and wow.  I can feel a difference already.

The first day I felt like a bow pulled back ready to release and had a sense of euphoria.  The first night I fell asleep at 11:30 and woke up at 3:30 AM. 

Here it is 4 days later and I don't have the euphoria but I do find it easier to do tasks that I would usually ignore or put off, Which is good for getting housework done.  I seem to be having issues with sleep but that may be just my body getting used to the medication.  I am having lucid dreams and waking on the hours after about 3:30 AM 

My wife was concerned about the euphoria and me getting motivation to do things that normally I would put off or complain about doing.  She is concerned that I may be a little manic.  I explained to her that for once I feel not normal but like I can do what I put my mind to now.  Where as before I just got frustrated or just didn't try.

I have high hopes that this will help me in my professional life as well as I was finding it difficult to study for my certifications. 

Funny I put off my health until I saw my daughter fighting the same issues I had in school.  It's like looking in a mirror.

*Just wanted to remind people to **upvote this post**. Recently, our weekly threads get pushed off the page pretty quick. More upvotes = more wins = more people getting inspired (it is a cycle).*

#####Science behind Win Wednesday (new)

* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.
  * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.

* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field. 
  * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**
  * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain. 

*I have much more information on the neuroscience of recognizing the good, let me know if you want more info.*

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***

* **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**

* **Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!** 

* **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**

* The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!

* **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!

1359041144.0,35,self.ADHD,176xvj,I'm starting to suspect boyfriend has adult ADD. Relationship is suffering.,throwadd,38,3,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/176xvj/im_starting_to_suspect_boyfriend_has_adult_add/,"I have a wonderful boyfriend of seven months.  I'm in my 30s and he's in his 40s. He is divorced and has two kids, one who has Asperger's.  He is happy, talkative, our sex life is wonderful, and 98% of the time I am very happy. 

I'd say that the two main things that we argue about are his dismissal of my concerns and his physical destructiveness.  (We have been talking about how I don't feel heard, and I'm not sure that is related to potential ADD.  I think the arguing over the ADD-related stuff causes him to tune me out.)

The physical destructiveness is driving me insane and is the primary reason I find myself posting here.  This is very wordy, because I am still frustrated over what happened.

We spend most of the time at my place, which I have worked hard to decorate nicely and organize.  I am not a neat-freak by any means, but I take pride in having a place that is warm and inviting and full of personal touches.  I live paycheck to paycheck, and I don't have money to replace things that get broken.  I'm not talking about destruction of fancy electronics (that I don't have) or anything like that, I'm talking about basic things like railings, cupboards and counter tops.  

He isn't destructive or messy on purpose, but it is as if he has absolutely **no spatial awareness**.  He is forever bumping into things - the railing on my stairs is permanently loosened from him crashing into it when he is trying to walk up stairs while speaking.  He is forever flailing his limbs and accidentally breaking things.  He accidentally pulls things out of walls.  He is forever (unnecessarily) tossing items, rather than making fluid movements to limit the carnage.  If he cooks, he creates a huge mess and seems unaware that the counter ain't gonna clean itself.  Something he uncaps stays uncapped.  If he's rinsing something, there is going to be a flood on the counter top, because he can't limit his movements to keep the water in the very large sink.  If he takes something out of a drawer, it never makes it back into the drawer, despite my requests that he please put it back when he is done.  I am very tired of cleaning up after him and fixing the things that he breaks.

The first time we talked about how I wish he would start noticing his surroundings was when he was sitting in the passenger seat of my car holding a little potted plant of mine.  We went around a curve, and because he was talking at that moment he did nothing to hold onto it and it got dumped all over my car.  After doing our best to clean it up, I begged him to please just start noticing his surroundings.

Here's the straw that broke the camel's back - last night, 10 seconds after walking into my house he tossed his heavy coat onto my coat rack.  Because of this sudden weight, the rack pulled out of the wall and crashed on the floor.  It had been securely attached with drywall anchors and screws (by me) and it has never even been loose in the 5 years I have had it up there.  And trust me that there is absolutely no reason to be tossing a coat - it is not as if the coat rack was at any sort of a distance from him.

He apologized for it and said he was sorry for being a bull in a china shop, but then went on to say that's ""just him"" and ""part of his charm"" and that I should accept it.  He seems to think that if I can't just let the destruction of my house go that I am simply an uptight person.  Somehow this has become MY problem.    

I know that these sound like small issues, but trust me that it happens frequently.  It is having a cumulative effect because he breaks things or creates unnecessary messes, I get upset, the more I get upset the more he justifies tuning me out because I'm ""uptight"".  He rolls his eyes at me and stops listening or attaching any importance to my words.  He seems to think that if whatever he's damaged or destroyed is not a problem for him, then it shouldn't be for me. 

His place is a disaster area.  There are piles everywhere.  Things are destroyed, everywhere.  I'm not going to judge him if that's how he wants to live, but it will absolutely be a problem for me if we ever move in together.  Living together with someone who creates huge messes, overlooks the huge messes and is constantly accidentally breaking things will drive me bonkers.

The other things that I notice are:  

* He has **trouble sleeping**.  He wakes up in the middle of the night with his mind racing and it takes him a few hours to go back to sleep.  He says he has a biphasic sleep pattern and it's how people used to naturally sleep before electricity was invented.  Ha.  When he does sleep he constantly has vivid dreams or nightmares.  I often hear him say ""Oh, I slept so well for a couple hours.  I had some wild dreams.""

* He has **trouble following through** with tasks.  

* He **talks fast**, and if he is doing something else while he is talking, he gets **extremely clumsy**.

* He seems to have **trouble picking up on social cues**, which leads to little rejections from his friends.  He gets his feelings hurt, and I think it's because of his missing cues.  As an example, we ran into some friends of his one night, and he missed every single cue they gave to wrap up the conversation.  He kept talking and talking and talking, and went off on tangents that I could see they were increasingly uninterested in.  He was talking at them, not talking to them.  The pace of his speaking kept increasing.  Everyone was uncomfortable, but he was so lost in talking a mile-a-minute about the best sandwich shop in a distant city that he didn't notice.  There were no pauses, and therefore there was no opportunity to catch his eye and gesture that we should go.  My solution was to wait until heads were turned, yank on his belt loop and then cover it up with a yawn and how we simply had to get going.  This finally snapped him out of his talking trance, but he gave me strange look as if I were rudely interrupting a conversation in which everyone was engaged.  We didn't talk about it because I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

He's made a joke here or there about having ADD (""Maybe my son gets it from me""), but I suspect that he really does have it.  He seems to think his lack of awareness is normal and it's just ""him""; I can see that it is not normal, at all.  

I just want to have a peaceful relationship where he knows that I appreciate him.  I hate feeling so critical toward him.  I realize I can try to not get annoyed at him when he breaks my things, but it is something that is very hard for me to do.  Even though I know he doesn't mean to do it, it feels really disrespectful toward me.  When he breaks something and I get upset, the extra layer he adds on of ""this just being him"" and my ""being uptight"" feels even more disrespectful.  The more time we spend together, the more he destroys.  I get upset, and the more I times I get upset, the more he tunes me out. The arguing is increasing.  The hurt feelings are increasing.  I find myself researching terms like ""body awareness and ADD"" because I am trying to understand how to make this better.

First of all, does it sound like he may have ADD?  I know no one is a medical professional capable of diagnosis, but I'd just like to see if anyone can relate to his behavior.  

If it does sound like ADD, how do I bring it up with him without hurting his feelings?  And what steps can I ask him to take to look into it?  And how do I not lose my mind in the meantime?

TL;DR  *I think my boyfriend has ADD and it is causing us to argue frequently.  I am frustrated. How do I tell him my suspicions without hurting his feelings?*

***
***  
### **The second session addressed “time blindness”.**

##### I. Intro.  

##### II.  Improving Time Awareness  
1. This will take practice^(3).  

2. Project how much time each task will take.  
3. Observe and record how much time each task actually took.  

##### III.  Always wear a watch and have a clock in view at all time.  

1. Test yourself -- without looking at your watch (or a clock), see if you can guess what time it is, by thinking back about what you have done since the last time you checked the time.  

##### IV. Always carry your planner with you.  

1. Find a planner, and commit to using that planner and only one planner for the duration of the 12-week course.  

2. Keep your planner with you at all times.  
3. Enter appointments, to dos, relevant addresses **immediately** as you think of them or they come up.  
4. Consult your planner thrice daily -- every morning, midday, AND evening.  

 * Plan each day the night before.  

 * Familiarize yourself with the plan and make any necessary changes in the morning *before* you start your day.  
 * Update your planner as needed midday.  
 * At least once per day, reschedule unfinished items.  

* **Set ‘cues’ for checking your planner, such as morning coffee, lunch break, and when you’re getting ready for bed at night.**  

##### V.  Scheduling

# ***Short-term scheduling:***  

 * All appointments must be recorded.  

 * All tasks should be scheduled.
 * All tasks not completed must be moved to the next time period.

# ***Successful Scheduling Tips:***  

1. Schedule repeating tasks (weekend bill paying, laundry, dishes) for the same time of day.   

2. People who work from home or study at home should observe regular business hours for school and work-related tasks.  Leave chores, errands, and recreation for evenings and weekends.  
3. Plan the most difficult/challenging tasks for when you’re most motivated, e.g. fired up about the topic before/after a meeting or class.  
4. If you’re feeling energetic, do the most difficult thing first -- the thing most procrastinated, or the task with the closing window of opportunity (that phone call that has to happen before 5pm).  
5. If you’re tired, do the easiest/fastest/most fun or most ‘automatic’ task first.  **”Just do *some* thing!”**  
6. Never leave a task midway through a difficult or complex part -- it will take that much more effort to ‘start up’ again.  
7. Schedule oversized ‘time-blocks’ for things that require more mental ‘start-up’.  
8. Make use of “time cracks.”  Waiting in line for a ride?  Reply to an email on your smartphone.  Check and update your schedule.  Text your friend about getting together.  
9. If you fall off the horse, get back on immediately -- don’t waste time berating yourself.  
10. Be sure to schedule ‘relaxation time’.  

##### VI.  Using “Time cracks” -- those little bits of down time while you’re waiting.  

* Waiting a few minutes for the microwave to heat something?  Do some dishes, take out trash, etc.  

* Update/plan your schedule.  
* Write a check.  Address/stamp an envelope.  Pay a bill online with a smartphone.  
* Make a list.  
* Menu plan for the week, decide on dinner, make a shopping list.  
* Decide on weekend plans, gift, what to wear for a party, etc.  
* Brainstorm paper or project ideas.  
* Listen to audiobooks.  
* In traffic?  Try to make words from the letters on license plates or ‘sightsee’ -- look at architecture, parks, etc.
* Carry a book, newspaper, puzzle book.
* Mentally plan long-term.

***
#### No-karma self-post -- upvote for visibility please!

***
### *Last week’s: Tip:*  Make/update a daily To Do list before you get ready for bed, so you *know* you have a plan, but still have time to unwind and not worry as you’re falling asleep.
### *Twist:* Knowing you *must* finish aim for at least 75% completion of your list, be mindful of not over-committing yourself.  Or break your tasks into attainable steps -- each smaller step is thus easier to complete!

1349146178.0,36,self.ADHD,10sp51,This past week has been amazing. I wanted to share- I found a good psychiatrist and am finally on medication!,totallyordinary,38,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/10sp51/this_past_week_has_been_amazing_i_wanted_to_share/,"I posted once before about the [first psychiatrist](http://totallyordinary.wordpress.com/2012/08/29/adjustment-disorder/) I met with. Short version: She told me that being able to concentrate on anything - including [hyperfocus](http://www.additudemag.com/adhd/article/612.html) - excluded me from ADHD. And while I had other symptoms, my life wasn't fucked up enough for it to be a disorder. 

After my second (and final) session, I had no idea what to do. I doubted myself. Was I just lazy? Was she right, and I don't have anything worth helping?

You guys are awesome. /r/adhd, friends and random strangers on the internet all came to my rescue. They shared their stories, listened to mine and unanimously told me that the psych I saw had no idea what she was doing.

So last week I found a new psychiatrist. Someone who specialized in adult ADHD. And it was amazing.

He didn't just read from a script. He didn't list DSM symptoms and ask me ""yes or no"". He asked about seemingly random things. My sleep patterns. Did I have hobbies? What kind of things interested me? How did I do in school? Were there times when I did better or worse?

And he gave me validation. He mentioned habits that were actually symptoms. Symptoms I've had my entire life, but didn't know to mention to the previous psych because I didn't think it was related.

In short, he did his job correctly.

So now, for the first time in my life, I'm on medication. And its amazing. I haven't found my correct dose yet (started at 5mg Adderall XR and working up slowly) but... I never realized how bad I was. Thinking clearly, on a regular basis, for the first time is amazing.

Structure is the name of the game, so hop to it: Plan your week, stick to the plan, and get über results!",steamwhistler,41,6,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1emv9x/kickstart_your_week_in_kickstart_sunday_structure/,"Kick-Start Sunday is where /r/adhd shares the goals, tasks, or habits we want to accomplish this week.  You will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.

*I suggest you read the whole post to be MORE successful, so put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*

***

## Choose the participation method that works for you:

* **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)*

* **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)*

* **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**

**Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*

***

By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)

By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.

***

## Suggested Guidelines

* **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!)

* **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress.

* **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you).

* **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*

***

## Tips

* Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound**

* **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is.

* **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.”

* **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky....

* **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead.

* **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*

***

## Examples from previous weeks:

* Tidy room.

* Buy car.

* Go to work.

* Attend all my classes on time.

* Reschedule appointment.

* Mornings: brush teeth &amp; meditate.  Evenings: brush teeth, meditate, journal.

* Pay bills.

* Plan vacation.

* Go to the gym 3x this week.

* Break down chores by days so I can have 'a day off with my darling' before he leaves.

* **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”

One of the symptoms is that you might blurt out something without thinking and I have been thinking back about some situations where this has happened to me.

Years ago (but it still haunts me a bit) me and a couple of friends used to see someone to buy weed from. He was a very over weight person who used to struggle to leave the house. Due to this, my friend who drove a London taxi at the time used to drive him places now and then because of the easy access for him and became quite close to him over a period of time.

Unfortunately this guy died suddenly of a heart attack (I think he was only in his late 20's) and looking back it upset a couple of friends quite badly. When my friend told me that this guy had died I blurted out  without thinking ""oh well, I needed a space in my phonebook anyway"" (I was actually up to 100/100 on my old Nokia phone).. needless to say, I felt like an arse and my mates called me out on it straight away.
That is probably the worst thing I have said without thinking.

* Did you tell your friends, coworkers, family about your ADHD?   
* Do you feel like your ADHD makes you special?

1356277277.0,35,self.ADHD,15bu1x,Ok It took a while to get it but Adderall is changing my life. The past 4 months have had a lot of changes.,ohhhbuddy,44,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/15bu1x/ok_it_took_a_while_to_get_it_but_adderall_is/,"I went to seek help for my ADHD in August. Well here is what has happened since. The week after my evaluation tests I went to see my psychologist again and we reviewed the results. I was copmpletely honest with him about my daily marijuana use. I was significant for anxiety, depression, and very high ADHD symptoms. It amazed me how accurate those tests got my situation at the time. He wanted to treat my low self esteem and anxiety first with some counselling and medications. Well, I was started on Zoloft 50mg once a day for my anxiety. It helped the 1st day I took it but it has to build up in your system for 1-2 weeks for the full benefits.

I couldn't go back for a month because of money issues with medical bills for a heart problem I had fixed earlier in the year. After a month I started to realize the situation I was in with my Fiance was bad. We were not meant to be together and I knew I should have admitted it to myself a long time ago. So I ended our 4.5yr relationship. We treated each other like shit. There was no support on either side. I played video games all the time and didn't help her and she yelled and screamed and never tried to help me. (that's just one part) My whole life changed from that point on. My anxiety practically went away. I started learning how to live a single life. I had no money when she moved out, no bed and still no help for my ADHD symptoms. I started exercising daily and began rebuilding the social life I had destroyed over the past 4.5 years. I have 2 jobs at this point so i sign up for a lot of extra work to start getting out of this money situation. My ADHD symptoms relieved a little. So I waited about 2 more months with out seeing my psychologist for any continued counselling because I couldn't afford it. When I was working one night, I am a nurse, an older friend and I were talking and she convinced me to try her Adderall 10mg.(I am very careful about prescription medications) I have never been able to complete my charting because I can't focus long enough to chart on 6 patients every 2 hours, but that day was different. I was able to focus and complete every task on time, get every bit of charting I needed to do done, and still feel calm and together. No jitterness or hyperness like I expected. Life changing. I scheduled an appointment the next week with my GP and told him about my experience with Adderall. He is a great GP and he told me its OK if I try someone's meds because it helps him know the right medication for me. He prescribed me Adderall 10 mg last Wednesday.

So my house stays clean and I don't feel the struggle to motivate myself. I see what needs to be done and I do it. Life is getting better. The only problem for me is the appetite suppression but now I just eat less. I am giving up alcohol and not smoking pot anymore. Just really enjoying the way my life has changed for the better.

AMA,zoepertom,41,4,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/wi9fh/i_have_adhd_and_did_a_neurofeedback_training_ama/,"Here's a little introduction: When I 14 I was diagnosed with ADHD. I tried a few medicines, I tried Ritalin, which made me depressed and turned me into a husk so I got Paroxetine. Then I took Concerta and after that Imipramine. When I was 17 I decided I wanted to live a medicine free life, so I stopped taking them. This went okayish for a while but I wasn’t the star pupil of the class. When I was 20 I went to live on my own. And that’s when I found out I couldn’t take care of myself. My living room was always a mess, you could not see the floor in my bedroom because of all the crap lying around. In the kitchen the plates would stack to the ceiling. I understood that I could not live on like this, so I decided to look for a method that would help me live a normal life and that’s how I stumbled on to neurofeedback. At first I was very reluctant, “you're fucking around with your brain. That can't be a good thing! Maybe I'll lose my personality and become boring or a completely other person!” But I got over it and started neurofeedback. I had 8 sessions a week for 4 months, each session lasted 20 minutes. The next 4 years were bliss, I got my driver’s licence, I actually remembered what I learned at school, and not just remembered but understood. After those 4 years I had a refreshing course neurofeedback, but I believe I only needed that because I started to smoke a lot of pot the last month. And now I'm 25 and living a clean and orderly life and I’m still me. Ask me anything.

Or maybe the irony lies within the non-irony of the situation, sort of like Alanis.

Anyway, here's my tl;dr:

I didn't realize that I had ADHD until about a year ago and I am now in my 30's. Started taking Adderall 10mg XR and it helped a lot with my last semester of school (which took 10 years to complete, mind you). I have not upped my dosage during that time and I'd like to start looking into some behavioral things that I can do to ""get"" better. Every time I look into it, however, I get distracted by something else.

So in the interest of a fellow space cadet, please share with me the non-pharma tools you have used to 1) control impulses, 2) learn to listen to people/pay attention better, 3) not fly off the handle at the smallest things, and 4) is that a butterfly?

For me what's worked so far is the medication combined with a forceful focusing on the situation at hand; so far I have mixed results with the latter. I notice that sitting on my hands will sometimes prevent me from blabbering non-stop and the other part is acknowledging when I actually don't know something, which allows me to be genuinely interested in the topic and thereby attentive. Triathlons have really turned things around for me as well, although after completing an Ironman 2 years ago, I had a huge motivational collapse which almost made things worse than they ever were. Now I spend most of my time running, which is a true god-/FSM-send.

So help! I am lucky enough not to suffer from a lack of self-worth and I'm fully confident in my abilities to do whatever the heck I decide to finally do...I just need to know how to actually get up and do the boring, menial tasks without getting distracted by that goddamn butterfly again.

By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)

By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.

***
## Suggested Guidelines
* **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!)
* **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress.
* **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you).
* **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*

***
## Tips
* Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound**
* **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is.
* **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.”
* **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky....
* **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead.
* **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*

***
## Examples from previous weeks:
* Tidy room.
* Buy car.
* Go to work.
* Attend all my classes on time.
* Reschedule appointment.
* Mornings: brush teeth &amp; meditate.  Evenings: brush teeth, meditate, journal.
* Pay bills.
* Plan vacation.
* Go to the gym 3x this week.
* Break down chores by days so I can have 'a day off with my darling' before he leaves.
* **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”

**""The Writer vs. ADHD""**

All right, I have to get started on this paper. Make sure the formatting is correct before I start. Which of these fonts looks better? No! It doesn't matter. Just go with Times New Roman. Nobody can complain about that. Punctuation. Who even started that? Ancient Greek doesn't have punctuation, right? So when and where did that start? Latin? Wikipedia will know... 

*15 minutes later...* 

Cuneiform is really cool! Wait, I have a paper to write. Ok. What to write, what to write... What was that sound? Oh, AC just turned on. How does a thermostat work, though? Temperature-sensitive metal in a coil, maybe? It would have to be pretty darn sensitive. Maybe it's a mercury thermometer, and that applies pressure to a sensor? Or that bends a coil, which has a tension-sensing device attached? Mercury is dangerous though. Maybe that's just old thermostats. Wikipedia will know... 

*30 minutes later...* 

Right. Good to know. I'm sure that will be useful some day. Back to work. Maybe I should work with pen and paper, to minimize distractions. Make it harder to google things. Ok. Pen and paper. This is good. Man, my letter ""g"" looks really funny. ggggggg  Should I work on changing that? I've got some extra space up at the top, not turning in this actual piece of paper, might as well use it productively. ggggggg What can I change to make it more clearly a ""g""? NO! I have to work on my paper! It's due tomorrow! ""To-morrow."" Hm. ""To the morrow?"" I wonder what the etymology is there. I'll look that up later 

 *makes note on arm*

Now, this paper. ""Portrait of a Writer."" ""Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man."" ""Portrait of Dorian Grey?"" No, ""Picture."" Right? ""Painting?"" Nevermind. Pretty dark, for Wilde. Was that Wilde? Think so. Maybe written in later years. Like Mozart, getting darker and more Romantic as he goes along. *Cosi fan Tutte* vs. *Don Giovanni*, *Eine Kleine Nachtmusik* vs. the *Requiem*. Have to look up order of those works, see if there's really a pattern. 

*makes note on arm* 

damn it Damn It **DAMN IT!** PAPER. Writing. Right. Aaaaggh, no progress. I suck at writing. Beginning is the hardest part, right? Something like that. Maybe I'm just not in the right mood. Maybe I should come back to this later? Yeah. Let it ruminate. Can't just go into a paper cold, got to give it some consideration. Sleep on it. It's late, anyway, sleeping well will make me better at writing. I can totally write a paper the day of, right? Done it before. No problem. I'll be in a better mood, more productive. Ok. *Sayonara*, paper! What does that word even mean? Wikipedia will know...

Reading the comments and I am absolutely awestruck at the amount of misinformation being spewed out.

***Comment - My thoughts***

ADHD epidemic - According to Barkley, no evidence of such.

ADHD drugs addicting - Not when prescribed properly.

Someone said people with ADHD seek out extra drama for extra stimulation. Im a therapist and think that's absolute crap. - I don't know, but I thought this was true.

ADHD testing is bullshit.  I purposely forgot things on the test and when I was supposed to hit the spacebar when I saw an X on the screen, I just mashed the spacebar because I thought it was funny.  My results said I had severe ADHD but in reality it's only minor. - Well this form of testing is by no means the best indicator of ADHD, but no shit, any test that you purposely fuck with will give fucked results.



Basically all this random bullshit being said and I thought to myself, what the hell happened to /ADHD?  Since when have these people become so ill-informed and believe in so many myths?  I felt like the only person on earth for a minute that had seen *any* of Barkely's videos.  THEN, I realized I was in /psychology and a flood of relief came over me.  Such a relief.

* I paid off my credit card.
* FINALLY hung my custom mirror that's been gathering dust in the hallway for about a month.
* Finished some more group projects ahead of schedule so I'm not the one everyone is waiting on.
* Today I realized I was the common denominator in many bad relationships that are most important to me. I told my loved ones this and started a new chapter today. Feels good.
* So far, I've managed to make $90 doing different repair work. This is a pretty big deal for me, my ADHD is bad enough that I'm on disability
* I had my highest GPA ever.[1]   with my most difficult courses ever
* Got my blood work done, got stuff needed for other medical testing, and I set up an appointment with a woman's counselor to add to the therapy I am already doing
* I'm late but I finally stopped talking about auditioning for a play at my local theater and did it! 
* I got engaged. :)
* I think I have finally identified a definable improvement of my meds.

Sleep is one of the best activity you can do for your ADHD brain!,computerpsych,38,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1bw3eo/kick_start_sunday_nighttime_routine_edition_start/,"###**This week, let's try to work on creating healthy nighttime routines that result in more sleep and productivity!**

# Examples:  
* **Intense enough exercise in the evening**--after which I don't expect to cogitate too heavily.  =P

* **Getting all my ""things to do"" out of my head.**  
  * I use *[Kick-Start Sunday (KSS)](http://redd.it/19kdo0)* because then I can't lose the list.  =P
  * I also keep a notebook or pad of sticky notes bedside with a pen, and use the light from my cell or ipod (aimed only at the paper) rather than turning on a lamp.

* **Developing a bedtime routine** so your brain starts to think about unwinding in advance.  
 * **GET OFF SCREENS 60 minutes before bed** - *This is the number one thing to help you sleep. TV, computer, cell phone...these all make your eyes think it is daytime (and usually are showing something stimulating in itself). I find that 90 minutes actually works better for me. Drink some tea, stretch, read your kindle (not kindle fire) or a book. Try it...it works! Every time I am up past midnight I was on the computer past 11!*
 * **Take bedtime medications or supplements, if applicable.  Drink some water either way.**  *(They take time to 'kick in', so it's good to remember to do this about 30 minutes before your planned bedtime.)*  **Set a timer for this.**  
  * **Make Overnight Oatmeal](http://www.theyummylife.com/Refrigerator_Oatmeal)** so I have grab and go breakfast in the morning.
  * **Clean sink for 5 minutes: gather dirty dishes from everywhere, and load dishwasher or wash dishes.**  (Unload clean dishwasher first, if applicable.)  Otherwise, wash your dishes or make sure all other non-dishwasher or unwashed dishes are stack *outside* of the sink.  *(Then you have space to work on breakfast or cleaning in the morning.)*
  * **Shower.**  I shower at bedtime, because then I'm not as rushed in the morning.  Being a bit damp afterwards helps your body *cool down* which is a 'time for sleep' trigger.  I usually do a quick 'rinse' shower in the morning as well (≤1-2 min.) as it's a 'wakeup' trigger for me.
  * Then in bed, **read an enjoyable, pleasant book or use guided meditation/relaxation**.

* Try **meditation, yoga, or guided relaxation** like this online free *[Relax with Andrew Johnson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzsV6ZwZvlQ)*, or the free mobile app version.  
  * I'm bad at meditation, and find it difficult to stay on track with a self-guided bedtime yoga routine, but this seems to work.  It's **not New-Agey** and **he sounds like Billy Connolly!  =P**

It's very disconcerting. When I was ten years old, my parents took me to a facility different than my normal pediatrician because my teachers said I was ""very bright, loves to read, but always daydreams in class and works ahead."" I was diagnosed with ADD (now referred to as ADHD-PI, as most of you already know).

When I turned 18 this year, I didn't feel like having a party, or even hanging out with friends. I didn't even really feel like going out with my family for dinner. I didn't feel incredibly depressed or anything like that; it was more like I was neutral to the whole situation, and didn't feel like doing anything special. 

Christmas was always my favorite holiday, but this year and the last were just kind of... dull-feeling. I got the same magnitude of moderate and thoughtful gifts from my family, but I didn't really care. 

In general, I hang out with the same few groups of friends, but I don't always say ""hi"" to them if I see them in the hallway, and I almost feel like I don't have many good things to say to them when we're conversing.

***  
***

The seventh session addressed “Setting Up an Organizational System.”  

##### I. The Plan.  
* In a good organizational system, everything has a place that is:  
 1. Easily identifiable.  *(You’ll spend less time guessing, won’t buy duplicates when you can’t find it, and be more likely to put it away.)
 2. Easily accessible.  *(You’ll waste less time if you’re not digging through layers.)*  
 3. Neat in appearance.  *(You’ll feel less distracted, not seeing “all the things that need doing.)*  

* Each room or section of a room should be organized so ***just the things needed most frequently are nearest.***  You may need to buy containers, baskets, or boxes, and filing cabinets or folders for storing and labeling particular items or categories.  *This doesn’t mean you need to spend lots of money on it!*  Find items in thrift stores, discount-department stores, or clearance sales, or buy contact paper to cover shoe boxes, for example.

* For example, in your living room, you might:  
 1. Take care of personal finances (pay bills, balance a checkbook, do your taxes and FAFSA).  
 2. Read or write materials related to your job or school.  
 3. Pursue a hobby like photography, painting, cooking, or sewing.  

##### II.  Creating ‘Zones’.  
The **top of your desk would have your computer** -- I do online bill pay and search for recipes and journal articles online.  I’m certainly not going to have a separate computer for each!  Placing it centrally allows it to be on the ‘edge’ of multiple zones, and filing or storing the other materials off to the side(s) gives you a clear workspace for *any* project or task!  

The **top desk drawer should hold ‘universal’ supplies**, such as pens, pencils, scratch paper, a ruler, a stapler, a calculator, etc.  If your work surface is a table, these ‘office supplies’ could go in an organizing tray on your bookshelf or on top of your filing cabinet, for instance.  

You might **place a filing cabinet on one side of your desk** -- one drawer for finances and one drawer for job or school papers.  Or perhaps you **put a bookcase on the other side of your desk** and with dedicated *and labeled* file boxes on the shelves.  In this case, you’d also have room for labeled bins for each of your hobbies.  You might even have two bins for painting or sewing, e.g. one for your ‘current project’ and one for other projects or backup supplies.  

##### III.  Creating a Filing System.  
You can **use colored labels or file folders to group similar papers**:  

* I have grey for financial stuff --
 1. A single folder for all my filed tax forms (since I have simple forms).  Each year is stapled with the supporting documents, labeled in big red numbers with the year, and filed in reverse chronological order so the most recent is in the front.  
 2. Another folder holds my current and past leases.  
 3. A separate hanging folder holds a folder each for automobile and bicycle registrations, etc.  
 4. My credit card and bank statements are all digital, but those would have separate folders, but perhaps be in the same hanging folder.

Blue is academic stuff, yellow for household (warranties and whatnot), etc.  

##### IV.  In-Box(es) and Out-Box(es).  
I have multiple in-boxes and multiple out-boxes; this lets me do a ‘rough sort’ in seconds.  I use a stacked horizontal-box sorter for this, and it sits on my bookshelf.  

* **Action In-Box** for urgent items, such as forms to fill out or bills to pay.  *(Take care of this daily, or have file folders labeled for mid-month and end-of-month bill-paying.)*  

* **Everyday In-Box** for paper scraps with websites, music, or books to check out and addresses to add to my Contacts, etc.  *(Take care of this weekly.)*  

* **To-Sort In-Box** if I’m in a hurry (while cleaning other rooms, for instance) or I simply don’t know what to do with an item.  *(Take care of this weekly.)*

* **Urgent Out-Box** for envelopes to be mailed, things to be put in the car, or papers or items to be dropped off or returned somewhere when I’m erranding, etc.  *(Take care of this daily.)*

* **To-File Out-Box** for papers that need to be filed -- I have ‘category’ file folders here for ‘Health,’ ‘Finances,’ and ‘Household’ *-- this lets me ‘pre-sort’ into smaller stacks!*  *(Take care of this weekly.)*


##### V. The Process.  
1. ***Divide the organizing project into parts.***  Don’t expect to organize your entire living room or garage all at once.  You can divide it into 30-minute periods and set a timer, or 4’x4’ sections, and know you can quit at the end of any ‘chunk’.  
2. ***Decide how many sessions you’ll need!***  A 16’x16’ garage will have 16 ‘sections’, for example.  Make a list of the ‘zones’ and schedule each one.  You may wish to alternate an ‘empty’ zone (in the middle of the garage) after a ‘packed’ zone of shelves or in a corner.  Or perhaps you want to start with the emptiest zone -- the only bare space you have.  
 
3. ***Give yourself a well-earned reinforcer after each!***  Something as simple as “I get to file the emptiest To-File folder or work on the emptiest section, or go make a cup of tea, work out, garden, go outside, etc.”  

4. If you feel tempted to stop before your ‘chunk’ is done, close your eyes and visualize how tidy and appealing the space will look when it’s organized and how much better you’ll feel about it (and yourself).  

5. ***Use a system for rough-sorting: ‘DRAFTS.’***  
 * Donate.  
 * Recycle.  
 * Action.  
 * File.  
 * Trash.  
 * Shred.  

*If you can’t quickly decide, place it in a Sort pile to return to.*  I used file storage boxes for the quick sort process when I had large, unsorted piles to manage, with multiple ‘File’ boxes, one each for ‘Household,’ ‘Health,’ ‘Finances,’ ‘Art ideas,’ and ‘Academics,’ for instance.  Then it was simple to place each small stack into a color-coded folder to place in my “To-File Out-Box,” making the future filing pre-chunked!  

##### IV.  If possible, enlist help!  
You can hire organizers, but even having a friend or family member to keep you company will help.  Explain you want them to be non-judgemental and be prepared to have things they can do, like sorting the mail into junk mail, and a mail-action pile for you to focus on.  If they’re willing, they can also do the sweeping, dusting, washing shelves, labeling containers (at your direction), etc.

### Don’t read *anything*, just sort for later!

I was diagnosed in 5th grade after not being able to accomplish a millisecond of work from 1st to 5th grade. I had to see 4 doctors, each of which gave me hours and hours of tests. I was given the lowest possible adderall dose (10mg, eventually by highschool 30mg) and went from all Fs to all As &amp; taught myself about 10 programming languages by age 13. I'm not sure if I would ever put my child on adderall, but my mother was out of options.

So my story makes sense to me. Life was impossible. I would be a dropout without professional help. The 1-2 other kids in my entire class who went on ADD medicine were in similar situations.

These days? Most of my friends have access to ADD medicine and over half have prescriptions. Doesn't it seem odd, if you make it through school without medication, then maybe you aren't that ill-equipped for life?

Which rarely happens as a result of my own initiative.

I'm very confused and exhausted mentally, and I don't know where else to go for advice, so I decided to look here on reddit.

I'm a 19 year old male who is starting over on my first year at college.  I went to a major university my first year, totally fell apart, and now I've lost my job, feel depressed, and the only things I've got going for me are my awesome girlfriend and my family.

I started to see a Psychologist because I thought I was depressed; she told me she suspects I have ADD.  She also told me the best way to diagnose if I have ADD, in my case, would be to start taking medication (prescribed by my primary care physician) and see how that works out with school later this month.

I've always been very weary around medication, and I don't want to become addicted or dependent on a drug. I can't even remember to take a multivitamin, I don't know if I could deal with the side effects of forgetting to take my Adderall.

My girlfriend tells me if I take the medication I'll become a different person.  On top of that stress, my own mother doesn't believe I could ever have ADD; her and my Dad just think I'm lazy and don't care about anything-- when I honestly just forget things.  They continue to say that even if I have ADD it's no excuse for not finishing things and that it's still just me being lazy.

I feel so out of control in my own life... I just don't really know what to do.  I want to be able to go to school and finish classes again. High School was never this hard for me.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did it work out/how is it working out?  Any general advice on what I should do?

And now, since the last couple of months, it's gotten to the point where I just can't do anything that requires any sort of active involvement.    
I can watch youtube and tv-shows an entire day with ease, even browse reddit or the rest of the internet, but the second I wanna play a video-game or do some other hobby-which-isn't-very-useful, I get this insane rush of anxiety that just stops me from even starting.

I get overwhelmed with the feeling that I'm wasting my time doing it and that I really should be doing something else, something 'productive'. Even though I realize that Reddit and Youtube is just as bad, it's like I justify it with ""well, at least I'm not ACTIVELY being unproductive"".

Worst part about it is when I actually try to do something productive, like working out or learning something useful, I go through the classic scenario of ""yeah this is going great! i'm gonna keep this up!"" and then promptly NEVER touching it again after a week or two.

It's fucking me over completely, and it's driving me insane.

So basically two things:    
- I can't overcome the feeling of being unproductive when trying to enjoy leisure-time.    
and    
- I don't know what to do with the constant loop of finding something to do and then dropping it.

Would these problems be helped with medication? And, what can I do in the meantime?

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 9 years old and started taking meds when I was in 4th grade, which was done by having a 9-year old me leave the crowded elementary school cafeteria and take a pill in the nurses office. The publicity of this made me, from a very young age, embarrassed about taking pills for my ADHD.

There were a few days that I forgot to take my meds, and teachers and peers would observe that I behaved differently, sometimes I was enough of a spaz that teachers would call my parents and mention that I was behaving strangely that day, which initially made me want to never stop taking them, and insecure about who I was with my ""normal"" brain. 

In high school, I started growing into myself a bit, hanging out with more friends after school, when my pills had worn off (at this point I was taking an 8-hour every morning, I stopped having to go to the school nurse in junior high). And I began to notice that the medicated me was a different person than the ""normal"" me. So I decided, in sophomore year, to stop taking medication.

Towards the end of junior high I discovered I had depression. In high school, I started seeing a counselor, but stopped because one day, I just failed to make my next appointment and never got around to doing it. 

Now let's jump to today. I'm about to go int my 4th year of college (which will not be last, or possibly not even my penultimate year). In November my girlfriend of 4 years broke up with me and I was forced to move out of our apartment and I now live alone. My grades are not great, but I was doing about okay. Now I find myself less motivated and more depressed than ever before in my life. I sit in my apartment, bored shitless, knowing I have a ton of work to do, then I decide to get high and watch The West Wing instead of doing homework that isn't necessarily long or difficult. I'm not sure how to get my ass back into gear, and I don't want to take pills that would alter my personality. I just discovered this community (and that it's not full of stupid posers who claim they have ADHD and actually just get bored doing boring things sometimes) and I'm next to certain there are plenty of you guys that can empathize.

My room was getting pretty bad. I would just leave crap on the floor and not do anything about it, so there was this layer of random crap strewn every-which-way. My desk and dresser were completely covered in old papers and water bottles. I kept telling myself I would clean it--but guess what, I never got around to it.

Then today I decided I was going to clean my room. I started at 1 pm.

First I took [eeeverything out into the living room](http://i.imgur.com/fqHzJGJ.jpg)--and I mean everything, except for my desk, bed, bookcase and dresser--and cleaned and dusted what was left. Then I gathered up all my clothes and started to put them away. I'm particularly proud of [how I stored my t-shirts](http://imgur.com/a/yukbt). This way, I can see at a glance which shirts are what. It also saves me the trouble of digging through shirts to get out a particular one. I was able to completely empty one of my drawers by hanging up all my jeans! 

Next, for some reason, I felt compelled to move my bedroom around. I guess I was just sick of how I had it before and wanted a layout that would give me a bit more space.

After I finished doing that (around 6 or so), I started to move everything *back* into my room. Thing was I had to sort everything first. I found stuff from 5, 6, maybe even seven or more years ago! Half the crap I had was from school. Since I just recently graduated high school, I definitely didn't need most of that--into the garbage bags they went. 

I also went through all my old toys that were in bins under my bed. A great majority of that my mom took (she's a teacher and likes to bring toys for her students to play with), while what was left I either threw out or kept.

Rant.,ianpdm,40,2,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17378i/people_dont_understand_what_it_means_to_not_be_in/,"Now let me start this off by saying that I'm in no way alleging that ADHD people are completely or even mostly out of control of their behavior. I am, however, saying that a large number of ADHD people can't control themselves even close to the level of a normal person. This isn't my opinion, it's a fact of the disorder. It wouldn't be a self-regulation/executive function disorder if this wasn't the case.

A common problem for ADHD people is the multitude of people you will encounter, many of them acting in an important capacity in your life, that will say ""just focus"" or ""you just need to pull up your boot straps and put in the effort. Everyone gets distracted. Everyone feels the urge to procrastinate."" It's really frustrating. Beyond that, actually, it's quite damaging to a person with ADHD that has to deal with their own inner voice telling them they're inadequate for much of the same reason. Those people don't see that what they're saying has this effect, and I doubt they even can. Either way, that's not the problem.

Another caviat: I'm refering to **most** people when I speak about people without adhd in this post. Lots of non-adhd people can empathize with us, but that's not the case for most.

The problem is that people without ADHD often can't picture an existence where they aren't at the level of control that they currently are. They can't process countless afternoons where you get home, determined to do your homework in a timely manner, only to end up starting it at 11pm after hours of doing nothing of substance.

When you tell someone that you compulsively procrastinate, they don't get what that really means and they just think you're exaggerating, and that really fucks with the person with ADHD. I mean, look nigga, if I could do my homework like everyone else, I would. It's not like I enjoy being so stressed out all the time or having shitty grades.

I mean, even when you give countless analogies and explanations as to how your brain works, some people just don't get it. This is indicated by the countless times I've been in class just fiddling with my pencils when we have a little pointless exercise to do and a close friend will be like ""you're doing nothing, you might as well just work on it"" and I have to just give some noncommittal answer like ""I genuinely can't muster the willpower"" because explaining to that person again why it's so hard is just not worth it.

Even if I could muster the willpower to not procrastinate, and I start my homework within the hour of getting home, I still wouldn't be able to focus until hours later. I can't do it. I just can't do work unless it's close to the deadline, unless the reality of the situation is apparent to me (which tends to be very very late). When an ADHD person tells someone that as an explanation, it just seems as if it goes in one ear and out the other. They just can't process this.

Telling many ADHD people to ""just focus"" or ""just work"" or ""just chug through"" is like telling a severely autistic person to stop making weird noises or to stop acting so fucking strange. It's just not in the hardwiring. Maybe that comparison isn't exactly 1:1, but it's **extremely** similar.

God I need meds.

**TL;DR It's really shitty that people don't understand the degree to which ADHD (and many other mental issues) affect the person's life.**

I'm 25, and was diagnosed with ADHD-PI at the age of 17 following some really stupid car accidents. I've been regularly taking Adderall XR since then (and am accident free!)

For as long as I can remember I've had a hard time naturally interacting with other people. When I meet a new person I have no trouble getting to know them, but over time I almost always manage to screw up my relationship with them. Now that I'm out of college I've had three distinct experiences with this:

* On a team of 15 people working overseas I managed to say and do things that pissed off my entire team over a 6 month period. Despite this, none of my coworkers felt comfortable confronting me about the issues, until it all built up into my dismissal from the program.

* About a year later I was working in IT support at my alma mater and made what to me felt like a very innocuous joke to a coworker who just happened to have more seniority than me. Despite my unmatched productivity (I would fix 3-4 times more computers than any of my coworkers), the complaint made its way up the chain and resulted in a non-renewal of my contract.

* At my current job providing software IT support I've had several instances where my coworkers have reported to my supervisor that I've been either rude or short with them while troubleshooting an issue. My background is in IT, and most of my coworkers have backgrounds in customer service.

Following the incident oversees I spoke with a counselor who encouraged me to get used to apologizing early and often. I've taken his advice and it has helped me to smooth things over when they're brought to my attention; however, there are many times where I know things are not communicated to me and I've just had to accept that people are rubbed the wrong way by me.

*The crazy thing is that I love receiving criticism/feedback, no matter how negative. It makes me feel like the person providing the feedback is looking out for me and is helping me to grow and become a better person.*

I'm currently exploring the possibility of CBT to help me curb my asshole-like tendencies. I guess I'm wondering about a few things:

  1. Does anyone else feel like ADHD causes them to have asshole tendencies?
  2. If so, what have you found to be a good solution for not being as much of an asshole to those around you?

Every time I see a post where someone tries to make it out to be an evolutionary advantage, personality type, or super power I just out right get annoyed.

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I won't deny them that. However, when I see regular speculation about the ""advantages"" of ADHD I start to wonder if these people actually have the same disorder I do or what. It leads to me personally worrying if this is the attitude that is carried over then what claim do people with adhd really have? it's bad enough when people who don't have the disorder sit back and doubt it but, when people who do have the disorder try to make it into something it's not it  gives people even more reason to doubt the disorder.

I'd love to hear your opinions on meds.,thingsthingsthings,36,2,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1bn0sb/anyone_else_with_both_adhd_and_an_anxiety/,"I'm a long-time anxiety sufferer. I'm officially diagnosed with panic disorder with (mild) agoraphobia, and the majority of my panic triggers include uncomfortable bodily sensations like rapid heart beat, lightheadedness, feeling out of breath...pretty much ANY symptoms related to being ""stimulated"" can induce a panic attack.

Now that my therapist thinks I might ALSO have ADD after giving me the Amen questionnaire, she's sent me to see my pdoc to ask about ADD meds. (This wasn't an out-of-the-blue thing; I'd been pretty sure that I've had ADD since I originally learned what it was.)

My pdoc brought up a very important point: she said that, as a severe anxiety sufferer, I probably couldn't handle any of the stimulant ADD meds. I explained that I have a love/hate relationship with caffeine -- it helps me to focus, but also makes me feel panicky -- so she said that stimulants are more or less out of the question because they're ""like drinking ten cups of coffee"" (her words). 

She brought up Wellbutrin as the only other serious option (which I really don't want to do -- I want to get pregnant within the year and I don't want to necessary start up something that I'll have to withdraw from in a few months). I also don't like the idea of anything that's long-acting...I have good days and I have bad days (attention-wise), and I'd honestly prefer something short-acting so I can decide to take it only when I'm working (say, M-F).

So, that leads me to two questions:

1. For those of you also have anxiety disorders, how have you reacted to stimulants in the past? Yay or nay?

2. What are my other options, if any, for something that I can take as-needed that won't stimulate me into panic?

I've tried approaching my attention problems behaviorally in the past two months or so (using the timer, breaking large tasks down, etc), but I'm still dragging and procrastinating and not getting my work done. I'm not sure where to go from here, honestly. :-\

That ADD/ADHD results from our ""instant gratification"" society and a tendency to be inactive. So I believed this is the truth, because we do live in a society that pushes pills as a fix for most every problem. We do love instant gratification.

I am an undergraduate student, about the start my SEVENTH year as an  undergraduate. I was an art major because it was all I was good at, but didn't want to have to churn out uninspired works and hope to be paid for it. So I switched to something else, and then switched a few more times--all majors completely unrelated and requiring courses that did not pertain to other majors. So I am really far behind now in pursuing a chemistry degree with the hopes of going into nursing or maybe medical school if I get this all sorted out and can fix my course grade history.

I knew something was wrong (I have for a long time, but didn't know what to do) and so I looked up info on ADHD/ADD and found a video by a college-aged girl who talked about how she saw someone, got help, and now is doing very well at life. At all of the things I fail so miserably at and can't figure out why I do, because I WANT to be so good at them. Organization. Punctuality. Memory. You all know, I'm sure.

I have accepted the condition is real, and am hoping that is what my issue is and that I'm not just a lazy person waiting for my breaks in life and hoping for reward with no effort on my part.

# Examples:  
* **Intense enough exercise in the evening**--after which I don't expect to cogitate too heavily.  =P

* **Getting all my ""things to do"" out of my head.**  
 * I use *[Kick-Start Sunday (KSS)](http://redd.it/1a2den)* because then I can't lose the list.  =P
 * I also keep a notebook or pad of sticky notes bedside with a pen, and use the light from my cell or ipod (aimed only at the paper) rather than turning on a lamp.

* **Developing a bedtime routine** so your brain starts to think about unwinding in advance.  
 * **Take bedtime medications or supplements, if applicable.  Drink some water either way.**  *(They take time to 'kick in', so it's good to remember to do this about 30 minutes before your planned bedtime.)*  **Set a timer for this.**  
 * **Make Overnight Oatmeal](http://www.theyummylife.com/Refrigerator_Oatmeal)** so I have grab and go breakfast in the morning.
 * **Clean sink for 5 minutes: gather dirty dishes from everywhere, and load dishwasher or wash dishes.**  (Unload clean dishwasher first, if applicable.)  Otherwise, wash your dishes or make sure all other non-dishwasher or unwashed dishes are stack *outside* of the sink.  *(Then you have space to work on breakfast or cleaning in the morning.)*
 * **Shower.**  I shower at bedtime, because then I'm not as rushed in the morning.  Being a bit damp afterwards helps your body *cool down* which is a 'time for sleep' trigger.  I usually do a quick 'rinse' shower in the morning as well (≤1-2 min.) as it's a 'wakeup' trigger for me.
 * Then in bed, **read an enjoyable, pleasant book or use guided meditation/relaxation**.

* Try **meditation, yoga, or guided relaxation** like this online free *[Relax with Andrew Johnson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzsV6ZwZvlQ)*, or the free mobile app version.  
 * I'm bad at meditation, and find it difficult to stay on track with a self-guided bedtime yoga routine, but this seems to work.  It's **not New-Agey** and **he sounds like Billy Connolly!  =P**

#####Science behind Win Wednesday (new)

* Scientists think our brain has a built in negativity bias by reacting more to a negative stimulus. In effect, our brain is like velcro for negative experiences and teflon for positive ones.
  * Painful experiences are usually more memorable than positive ones and lasting, good relationships typically need at least a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions.

* By **tilting toward the good** you are leveling the playing field. 
  * **Instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve, they’ll collect in the implicit memory deep down in your brain.**

* **Soak in the positive events in your life**
  * By pausing and holding that positive feeling for a BIT longer, you are slowly changing the wiring of your brain. 

***

Win Wednesday is a chance to focus on our accomplishments for the week. Doing this enough WILL change your brain for the better!

###***The Sacred Creed of Win Wednesday:***

* **Each and every one of us have victories every week, be they great or small. But in Win Wednesday, *no* victory is truly a small one.**

* **Whatever ""level"" you happen to be at, progress is *always* a cause for celebration!** 

* **Please don’t discount anything you have done. The whole point is to share how YOU won, and did not let your ADHD win!** Check out the examples to see what we mean!**

***
* The point of Win Wednesday is equally **to share our wins AND celebrate the wins of others!** If you do or don’t have a win, feel free to give positive support and cheer to those posting (not just upvoting)!

* **Each week Win Wednesday gets hundreds of views, but only 5 people replying to the winning comments...let’s change things this week!** Just saying “good job” means a lot to someone who has been struggling!

Inspired by the recent poster who did a great job recounting the things about his life which made sense, I wanted to make my own list. Wondering if anyone else had similar experiences.

I'm ADHD - PI (or SCT, not really sure)

* Every Wednesday in 3rd grade we had to take out our spelling homework and the teacher called on random students to read aloud. Every Wednesday I pretended to drop a pencil and hide under my desk for the entire period (never once actually completed the spelling homework). 

* That same 3rd grade year I won an award for high achievement only given to one student in the grade (out of about 300 kids). I remember standing up on stage in shock, feeling like any minute someone was going to say ""just kidding, we know you don't do anything and are a big sham and impostor!"" That feeling of being an [impostor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) in work and life stayed with me ever since. 

* Sunday nights gave me stomach aches in grade school. Thinking of all the homework I didn't do, or homework I didn't even realize I didn't do. Or the tests I didn't study for. I always ended up studying the period before the test, and still managed to graduate top of class... but man, Sunday nights still haunt me.

* I still have recurring dreams that I actually never graduated from college (I graduated 10+ years ago) because I missed a final exam or didn't turn in some required piece of paperwork 

* I've always felt the people around me at work are a fraction as smart as I am (hate to sound immodest but thats been my honest feeling), but somehow are so much more successful. With a year of medication under my belt, I now see that success is highly correlated with sustained focus and attention, more so than raw intelligence.

* My friends used to call me Phoebe (from Friends) because I was so spacey. We could be having a conversation about cute shoes, and all the while I was having a whole other conversation in my head about the origin of the universe.

* I could never put a cute outfit together with accessories and all and then manage to re-create that outfit more than once or twice. I'd lose the accessories, forget to dryclean the dress, and somehow lose the shoes under one of my endless piles.

* Being ADHD (PI), I am hypoactive and need more sleep than the average person. My friends always made fun of me for not being able to stop yawning once 9pm hit. While I had a pretty social group of friends, going out at night was incredibly difficult for me.

* My husband's fascination with my inability (and indifference) to wear matching socks.

* Doing incredibly well in a new school year or a new job for the first X months while I was hyperfocused, only to go down in flames once I ""proved"" myself or lost interest. Almost like I knew I had to get a good reputation up front so when I stop doing anything at all, I could ride the wave of my first impression

* I showed up to school on several occasions and until I sat down for class, didn't realize I was still holding the TV remote control in my hand from my morning show.

* There literally have been MONTHS where I've done no work at all in the office (I work in a Fortune 100 company with a decently high position). My doctor still doesn't quite believe me when I tell him this.

Sorry for the non-ADHD friendly long post. I'm clearly still on my meds right now.

The debate over the the ADHD prognosis is justifiable contentious and completely understandable from a scientific standpoint. That is not my beef.
****
What baffles me is that many /r/ADHD subscribers are quick to proclaim that ""make no mistake, ADHD is a disease that is undoubtedly a social hindrance and cognitive impairment."" I will concede that it is a *disorder* and it presents a wide array of difficulties for each person in different ways.
****
That said, it is psychologically and physiologically impossible for us to live without our condition - its hardwired. When you come to this realization, what good does it do to maintain pessimism if its impossible to run away from your condition. Face it head on, and make the decision yourself whether or not your going to let it define you and who you become.
****
I'm not suggesting that coming to terms with ADHD means adopting an unrealistic denial of your challenges. Just the opposite. Why not embrace what you have, and devote your energy towards better understanding your type of ADHD and how you can best work it into your life.
****
I'm not religious, but I do think that its important for us to accept the realities of the problems in our lives, and seek to make the best of them. There's an old saying on Reddit, you know: **Challenge Accepted.**
****
My point is that we are faced with an invisible disease, and more often than not, we rely on communities like these for support. Show some support for those who are depressed, or who fail to see a way to cope with their problems. It is possible to live a happy and productive life with ADHD, its all a matter of whether or not you are ready to take on the burden of making pro-active changes in your life.
****
TLDR; Nobody benefits from comments like ""ADHD sucks, it ruins my life. There is no hope."" Accept the cards you've been dealt, and deal with it. If you're unhappy with how ADHD has affected you, then *you* need to maintain optimism and seek ways to change your life to better suit your symptoms.

What I eat, when, when I take meds, meditate every day, exercise every day, go to sleep at the same(ish) time every day, wake up at the same time, etc.

This has been immensely helpful for me and made me a happier and more productive person, but I'm still perplexed by the fact that waking up in the wrong way can pretty much erase all the benefits of the positive actions I am taking to combat my disorder.

For example, yesterday I woke up after an 8 hour sleep feeling like shit. Although meds kept my energy up, my focus was like a hummingbird. Could barely stay on target for a few minutes.

Today I woke up after a 7 hour sleep feeling great. My energy is similar but my focus is now like an eagle. Same nutrition, same exercise, same everything mostly.

This is just one example, but I have been noticing this for the last few months. As powerful as other factors are for my well-being, energy and focus, that weird ""How you wake up""-factor seems to play a huge role. And I really wish I could control it better.

I'm using an app that supposedly detects your REM cycles and wakes you up between them (mine is called Sleep Cycle but there's a bunch of them), but I haven't had much success with it. I still let it do its work every night, since it can't hurt, but my brain still wakes up in a London fog every few days.

**I have a few questions, in no particular order, and I'd appreciate if some of you awesome people here could comment on them or just share your experiences:**

* How do you deal with a day that starts like this? Do you have any methods or tricks to clear the fog?

* Why does this happen? Is it just waking up in mid-REM or might there be some other factors at play?

* Have you noticed anything that makes it likelier for you to wake up with a relatively clear mind rather than foggy surliness? I'm open to any suggestions, anecdotes and experiences.

  When I was a kid, I was diagnosed with a learning disorder, ADHD, depression, anxiety, and a host of other problems. 

  I spent almost my entire educational career in Special Education classrooms. 

  I wasn't like the other kids there either. My differences weren't visible. I didn't have ticks. I didn't have problems learning to read or to write. I could speak well and I was very apt at learning and memorizing facts that engaged my imagination. 

  I convinced myself that I was wrongly imprisoned, and that I was gifted but they didn't know what to do with someone who was gifted and unique as I was, so I just grew to hate school and teachers and authority. 

  My mom moved away from me when I was 16 and left me to live with my uncle. 

  I guess what I'm trying to say is that... I used to believe that some day I would grow out of my challenges and differences. I was convinced that once I was on my own that my true potential would reveal itself. 

  It didn't. 

  I struggled for years to adapt to the world that was completely indifferent to me and my differences. Nobody makes special exceptions for you. Not when they have to chose between their own well being and yours. 

  I couldn't keep a job. I quit every project I ever started. It was school all over again, but nobody was keeping me there. There was no IED, no meds, no counselor, no support system. 

  I grew bitter and angry with my childhood and everything that had happened, but for the wrong reasons. 

  I was mad at my mom for putting me in Special Ed. I was mad at being grouped with people who were physically disabled or developmentally disabled. I was mad at adults who kept having me tested and evaluated. 

  I felt like being different was a thing that people had done to me. And if they'd just left me alone I would've been fine. 

  It's taken me nearly 30 years to realize that the truth is much more complicated than that. 

  My childhood wasn't perfect, but everyone involved did everything they could to make it better for me, and I hated them for it. 

  It gets better when you realize that being different doesn't necessarily mean you're unhealthy. It doesn't mean you can ""get better"" one day. 

  It gets better when you get to know yourself and stop pretending that you have to be like other people. That you've got to live up to anybody else's expectations. 

 When you know who you are and what you've got- your strengths and weaknesses and quirks, you can become stronger. You can get better at living and working and being with other people. 

  But first I had to stop blaming. It isn't anybody's fault that I have ADHD. It isn't anyone's fault that I have a learning disability. Nobody has to take responsibility for that but me. 

  And then I could finally let the people who love me back in, and be a part of my life again.

I revealed my diagnosis with the nurse manager of the clinic. It was scary, but it turns out she has a grown son with ADHD and understood better than I thought she would. We are working on a more structured schedule for me, and it is a big relief. I'll keep updating. 

**ORIGINAL POST**
I thought I would enter my perspective as a healthcare provider who has ADD.

I was not diagnosed until after residency. Many people are able to compensate in a controlled environment (such as school, residency) due to the imposed regular schedule. 

I have always had problems with inattention &amp; completing tasks, but my real trouble started as soon as I got my first real job. The paperwork &amp; record-keeping is the bane of my existence. I am constantly trying to keep up, and for me, this is the most difficult part of my job.

I have also encountered a surprising lack of understanding in the medical community about ADD in adults. Due to my difficulties with paperwork &amp; getting ANYWHERE on time, I have really been rejected by many of my peers. I feel inadequate most of the time, even though I know that I am good at the ""real"" part of the work I do. 

Doctors are not praised for skillful diagnoses, great procedural techniques, or sympathy with patients. Doctors are judged (harshly) by how many patients you can see in a day, and how clean your in-box is. Doctors are very unsympathetic towards their own kind, and any perceived problem is a weakness to be exploited. 

I've been out of residency for 8 years, and I am screwing up every job because of time management issues and completing paperwork. I'm seriously considering leaving the profession because there is no way I can be that person who sees 50 patients a day, does a good job, gets paperwork all done, then repeats it all the next day.

Do any other people face the same on-the-job discrimination?

I'm 43, have a husband with major medical issues for which I sometimes have to be caretaker, and at the time, I had just lost my house, had to move, and had a extremely challenging job that suddenly required a lot of unplanned business travel.

I spent almost six weeks on the couch unable to do anything. I was depressed. After the docs figured out I have ADD, and have been medicated, things have become much better.

But, I realized that the job I had was going to kill me. So, on my therapist's recommendation, I quit. Looking back, it was for the best.

So, I have decided that I have a renewal on life. I can now pursue what I want to instead of doing what I think I have to. I'm starting business with a life-long friend and I am writing my fingers off.

I went from taking summer classes to raise my GPA enough to enter the nursing program to getting on the Dean's list after I started treatment.  

This was 1996, and my doctor put me on Cylert (Pemoline).  We started with Ritalin, but it turned me into a zombie.  It was like a hyper-focus at the lowest dose.  I could've stared at a rock for hours, and was unable to switch gears for even minor things.  It was a strange feeling.  And it made me really tired.

Anyway, Cylert.  That stuff was the Mork to my Mindy.  (Or rather the Mindy to my Mork?)  It made the Elaine dance of my head turn into a graceful waltz.  Brain gears that had rusted long ago were clean and shiny again.

Do normal people feel like that all the time?  Without medication?  Do they have any idea how lucky they are?

Even after college, I kept taking it.  I had taken a job as a critical care nurse, and still had plenty of things to study and learn.  It was nowhere near as demanding as a full load of classes in college, of course.  I found, during my free time, that I had *creativity*.  I found myself focusing on creative hobbies that I never had the desire to do before.  And I had plenty of focus to complete entire projects!

In 2002, I started a nursing blog.  It became fairly popular as far as medical blogs go and I found that I really enjoyed writing.  A lot!

In 2005, all of that came to an end.  Cylert had a potential to cause liver failure.  I had been getting labs every 6 months religiously and they had always been fine.  But I guess with all the newer medications, tptb decided the risk wasn't worth it and they took it off the market.  It was no longer available as a brand or generic.

Since then, things have slowly gone downhill.  Concerta literally put me to sleep (why??).  Adderall, in doses that actually work, give me palpitations.  In conjunction with high blood pressure that I have, the palpitations scared me.  

So I take tiny doses of Adderall now, a few times a week.  It's better than nothing.  It helps for when I have to sit down and pay bills, for example.  It gives me a tiny boost, but my surroundings are chaotic, cluttered,  and disorganized.  It doesn't help that I have a toddler that undoes everything I *am* able to organize and put away.  I still write for the blog, but it's not the same and it's rare (I usually get the desire to write if I've taken an Adderall for something else).  Forget doing anything creative.  I have a lot of *desire* to learn new crafty hobbies, but nowhere near the focus it takes to follow through on anything.  The last crafty thing I did while on Cylert was temari, and it was so much fun.  I still look at all my supplies and wish I had the focus to take it up again.

So my mind is back to drifting along to wherever the current takes it, just doing what needs to get done and nothing extra.  Usually not even that.  Thank goodness for my endlessly patient and supportive husband.  

But when I actually think about the situation, it makes me so sad that there was something that fit my brain so perfectly, made me feel normal and productive, and now it's gone and I can never have it back again.  To be overdramatic and probably insensitive - I feel like I was born an amputee that was eventually given one of those super-fancy prosthetics only to have it replaced with a wooden peg just when I'd finally figured out how to harness my potential.

Thanks for reading.

TL;DR - found the perfect drug, they yanked it off the market, now taking something barely adequate and I felt like whining about the whole thing and included an insensitive metaphor at the end.

There's questions popping in my head like:
""What if I don't have ADHD, what if I'm really just lazy, where do I go from here""

It's not like I want to be diagnosed with ADHD, I just want help for my problems.
My life is a total mess, I have so many great ideas, but I can't seem to start on these projects.
Everything I start never gets finished, even though I start enthusiastically, it always ends in failure.
My friends don't even listen to me anymore when I got this great idea, because they already know I won't do it anymore. I can't even finish a video game.
I spend to much money on things I don't need.
My paperwork is a mess.
My school is a mess, I missed all exams because I was too scared to go. When I started learning I got these panic attacks, and couldn't concentrate at all. It was like I was reading but nothing went through me.
My house is a mess.
Dishes almost never get cleaned.
I can barely get myself to feed my cat (but I do).
I always forget so many things, where I put my keys and such.
I can't concentrate on much, if watching a movie I get distracted.
When I'm enthusiastic about something, I'm unable to sit still.
I go to bed late, feeling really tired all day.

And it's not that I'm depressed, I know that I'm not depressed. I've being this way all my life.

I'm sorry if this text doesn't make much sense.
So what my question actually is.

If I don't have ADHD, can the Psychiatrist help me get my life back on track?
And If I do can they also help me?

Is it too late for me to start chasing my dreams, and become what I wanna become? I'm 22 at the moment.

I started both at around the beginning of the month like a responsible well rounded schedule-following person.

1342469389.0,31,self.ADHD,wnt84,My boyfriend is going through the process of being diagnosed with ADHD. Sometimes I have a difficult time dealing with his distracted brain. How do I gain a better understanding of what he is going through so that I can better support him and be patient with him?,solare1123,38,7,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/wnt84/my_boyfriend_is_going_through_the_process_of/,"I'm not sure if this issue has already been addressed here, so I thought I might as well just post so that I could get your guys' perspective on it. 

My boyfriend (21/m) and I (20/f) have been together for almost five months. He's one of the best guys I've ever known--so smart, understanding, intellectual, funny, supportive, caring, an all-around good person whom I love. We've become best friends since we started dating. 

Background: Long story; he was diagnosed as a kid but taken off the medication because it made him TOO focused and they thought the inattentiveness was more a side-effect of depression; after taking the medication for that they took him off of it because it seemed that he was “better” since he was behaving and doing well in school. In college, it became clear to him slowly that his difficulty focusing was still ADHD. He just finished taking the test; now waiting for results and the opportunity to talk to a psychiatrist. 

While we don't often disagree, most of the issues that have risen are related to his difficulty focusing. I'm a pretty scheduled person, and while I like to lie around and do nothing on occasion, I also hate putting things off. Consequently, it's always very stressful for me to be with him because I'm trying to do my work, while he's distracting himself with other activities (like browsing the web) when I know he should be studying. This results in him having to cram before exams all night and then him being tired the next day so that we're unable to do what we planned to do. Before we both left for the summer, we had planned to leave town a little later so that we might have time to spend just being together before we went our separate ways for a few months. However, we ended up having to fill our last days packing his things because he didn't have it done like he said he would. It ended up that I did in a few hours what would have taken him two days to do (if I hadn't helped him). During the process he would often get discouraged and them stop doing a task, deciding instead to start a new task without finishing the first task, which frustrated me because I like to complete a task before moving to the next one. 

Currently he is in a different continent doing volunteer work, and keeping in touch with him has been slightly nerve-wracking, due to his inability to respond to emails promptly. I had to deal with not knowing whether or not his not being able to reply is due to his difficulty in initiating the task of responding to an email, or because something happened to him. Now that he has mobile Internet, it’s much easier, but he’ll say he’ll make me a video or write me something, but then not do it. I end up waiting and being disappointed because I miss him like crazy and anything I get from him makes me feel better about his absence. 

I know that what he is going through is something that he can't help, but sometimes it's hard for me to not think that he won't do something because he doesn't care. I feel the burden of having to motivate him because I'm naturally very fretful. I get very anxious and it taxes me emotionally when he promises to do something for me and doesn't. He will explain to me that it’s because of ADHD that he has trouble doing things for me. I don't want to write him off as lazy or not caring enough to do something for me, because I know that's not true, but it's hard to believe that all the time, maybe because I don’t fully understand it. It’s hard for me to separate his personality and his caring for me from the consequences of his having ADHD. 

**TL;DR** I’m just trying to be an understanding girlfriend and see where my boyfriend with ADHD is coming from. He accepts and tries to work with my faults; I want to do the same for him. Any advice? Even just links to helpful websites would be appreciated. Thanks!

One of the problems I have had for a long time is putting down my purse and leaving it places!  Sure, I've gotten better about it, but this is a habit that I've spent 23 years building, so I'm trying really hard to break it. Cue.... [the lost item transmitter/receiver!](http://i.imgur.com/kvx8zrl.jpg)  This little sucker isn't a great one, but work provided it to me for free.  

The little round transmitter goes into my purse, and the receiver stays on my keychain.  Sort of bulky, sure, but it starts beeping at me whenever the two get too far apart and buzzing loudly if they get much further than THAT (and if I HAVE to separate them for some reason, I have to consciously turn off the receiver and that forces me to put my purse somewhere that I will actively remember!)  It even lets you adjust the distance the two can be apart before it starts freaking out, hahaha.


**Edit:** Oh yeah.  There's also a reversed mode, so if I have my keys (from the hook by the door) and don't know where my purse is somehow, I can basically play 'hot and cold' with the receiver and it'll beep faster the closer it gets to the transmitter!


I'm thinking about shelling out the money to [upgrade slightly, possibly to this one](http://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Locater-Control-Receiver-Transmitter/dp/B0042URI5Y) on Amazon (there's no referral code or anything, and I work for a university, I'm not trying to push a product here :P), but for people like me, who are always putting things down and walking away.. it helps! :)  I just thought I'd share.",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,1373505684.0,,ORANGE,True,t3_1i08uj,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1i08uj/got_a_lost_item_transmitter_and_receiver_to_help/,

*edited for formatting*


One of my biggest struggles in this lifelong battle for an organized life is that my mind gets really cluttered after about four or five days of the same schedule. Stuff starts to run together. Did I feed my cat today? I remember feeding him, but I may just be remembering that I fed him yesterday, without the yesterday part. Did I remember to check my planner? I might have, but that might have been two days ago, or it could have been two hours ago. Etc. I've realized that changing things up tends to make things I've DONE easier to remember, but keeping a wildly varied schedule makes it exponentially harder to remember the things I have yet to do.


Anyway. What has always ended up happening is this: I'll last about two weeks, tops, (more often, though, it's only three or four days) on some new schedule or routine, and then the dreaded brain fuzz starts to creep back in. Did I do this or that yesterday, today, or three days ago? What did I eat today? Oh god, I don't remember when I  checked my finances last; is my bank account overdrawn yet? 


Around the last week of December, I started reading up on alternative sleep schedules. I was really drawn to a [biphasic](http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/siesta/) schedule: a 4.5 hour long block at night, with the day split into two distinct segments by a 1.5 or 3 hour block during the day depending on what your body needs in the way of sleep. I was apprehensive (because come on, I've rarely seen anything through my entire life), but I liked the idea of being both a morning person and a night owl, so I decided to dive off the deep end and give it a shot.


I've managed to, barring a day of [monophasic](http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/monophasic/) sleep on a weekend here and there, pretty much keep this thing up, and I'm going on week three now. So far, I've managed to work out regularly, eat healthy meals regularly, keep my living space relatively spotless, feed my cat and scoop his litter twice a day, and basically keep a relatively cool head.


And the dreaded brain fuzz? It hit me last night, but for whatever reason, the 4.5 hours of sleep plus a couple of hours this morning to take it slow, make breakfast, have a cup of tea, and slowly review my calendar completely chased it away. Added bonus: I'm slightly groggy during the day sometimes, but it's nowhere near the epic levels of drain and fatigue I normally deal with on a daily basis. Suddenly, I'm like what is this, you mean there are more than four useable hours in a day?? For the first time in a long time, I'm feeling extremely hopeful about organizing my life. :D 


Anyway, I have no way of knowing for certain if this will end up being a long term change, but I hope the positive habits I'm finally starting to reinforce will be sustainable over the new semester. Here's to baby steps and small victories.

Whether its in conversation and I'll speak with no filter, or if I'm working on a project and don't slow down enough to make sure I've completed all the tasks necessary, (Think sending an email without an attachment) I've always felt like I've been rushing. I even would run up and down the stairs, at age 31!!!

I've tried Ritalin, Concerta and Vyvanse and all have helped me focus, but they also made me agitated, increased my desire to smoke cigarettes and a bit irritable on the comedown. 

Strattera on the other hand, has slowed me down, incredibly. I feel like I'm no longer rushing, my mind isn't clouded with 1,000 different thoughts and I've become more focused and organized because of it. Yes when I first started I felt a little drowsy, but I can honestly say that I've never felt better.  I also like it because I HAVE to take it everyday. Unlike the speed-like meds this one needs to be taken everyday to be effective, so it keeps me on a schedule.

Most of my life, especially during times when my medication wasn't quite right, I've had this ""mental radio,"" a constant stream of chatter, mostly music, that I am unable to turn off. My best example of this was when I was a senior in high school. I was taking a test and, for the life of me, I couldn't stop looping this song in my head that I'd heard on the radio. I was on Concerta back then, at 120 mg (yikes! and I hated it. I was drugged off my ass and the damn radio STILL chattered on.). Whenever I try explaining ADHD to someone who doesn't have it, I tell them it's like having a radio in your head that you can't turn off no matter what you do. 


I've been taking Vyvanse for a few years now and I've found that the radio is still there, though not as often and much, much quieter. In fact, I am *able to meditate* if I concentrate. When my medicine begins to wear off, the radio comes back, though, having lived most of my life with it, I barely notice it anymore. Still, there are times when I'm really trying to concentrate and I just can't make it stop. This is the reason why songs just stick in head for days on end.

1337339351.0,33,self.ADHD,tt44k,"Acceptance of your limitations, why justify yourself to others. A total rant here, and it feels good.  ",ms_lilly_lee,34,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/tt44k/acceptance_of_your_limitations_why_justify/,"So my ADHD coach said something last week that really stuck with me, she said that people with disabilities often put a lot of time and effort trying to do the things that their disability does not enable them to do. I spend all my time and effort trying to be some one I am not. I went to university and college 3 times trying to get a more prestigious job and I have yet to finish. I keep loosing interest and failing out. Perhaps I am not meant to go to school, or work in an office, or be that type of person. 

So why am I so quick to justify to people why I am ""only a waitress."" I am a damn good waitress, and I actually love my job, and yet I think I am ashamed of myself and feel like others think less of me. When I am asked what have I done with my life, at 28 I should have done more.... but not for me, it's for my family, for the people I will see at my 10 year high school reunion, and because (for some strange reason) I need that ""I have a disability and I have overcome the odds and now I'm successful"" moment. 

Why can't I just accept that I will never be comfortable as a secretary, sociologist, accountant or book keeper. Those dreams belong  to someone else. I still don't really know what I want, but I know that I love serving. I love the fast pace, the customers, the tips, the free food, the fact that I can take up to 14'000 steps in the run of a shift (according to my pedometer) and the fact that it's something that I've grown very comfortable with and when I forget myself, I take pride in. 

I really need to stop justifying myself. The school setting will never be for me and my adhd, I can't sit still long enough to read a book. I am not stupid, because when I love something I can do really well, but when I'm doing it so I can look prestigious in the eyes of others then it's fake and my energy fades away with each class I pretend to be paying attention to.

**So here I am in all my glory. What I need to accept is that:**

 - I am NOT naturally a studious person, I may never go back to or finish college

 - I am passionate with what I love and hyperfocus can be a blessing in disguise

 - I am a great waitress and there is nothing wrong with that, I love my job and who cares what others think

 - I will never be organized, neat and tidy. I need to work hard to keep these things under control  but they will never be perfect.

 - I am creative and fun. People tend to like to be around me because I am impulsive, random and keep things interesting. **EDIT:** Some people tend to *dislike* me for the same reasons, and that's *their* problem, *not mine.* I'm over it.

 - I will forget things, I'll try my best to write them down. I will make lists of lists, but I may still forget.

 - I will try my best. Some times I will be distracted, but I will *try my best* to get right back at it once I realize I'm gone off track. Others may not have this problem, but I do, so I simply have to deal with it.


**What do you need to accept? Are there things that you feel the need to justify or that you undermine in yourself?**

Things to include on this could be

* Video games (set a max time)
* TV or certain TV shows
* THOUGHTS - Stop telling myself that I can't do things, 
* Don't eat fast food (except maybe once this week)
* Stop comparing myself to others
* Stop judging myself when I catch myself doing something on my to-not-do list!

There are so many possibilities but I just woke up so all the ones I were thinking about yesterday I forgot.

Thus, I've been taking more than I'm prescribed, and my impulsive, must-do-this-now--""in the moment""--self has been screwing-over my future--end-of-the-month--self, and the latter is getting sick and tired of it.

So I look at why ""in-the-moment"" feels he needs to take more than prescribed, or self-medicate.

When I take my first dose, I take it to get my day going; however, if I feel like the first dose is not working, or if I get distracted and look at the time later to see that I have gotten nothing done, I get a little upset at myself and go to take the 2nd dose to actually start buckling-down and reclaim my day from my unproductive distractedness.

Then comes Part II of my day where my 2nd dose has worn-off by 4:30pm, or so. Now, I'm in a predicament because if at any point before I go to bed I have an idea of something I wanna get done, I almost impulsively think, ""I'll probably need my medicine for this,"" and so starts the lousy trend leading up to sleepy/depressed/unmotivated ""end-of-the-month""-self without 2 pennies to scrape together, so to speak.

Also, I've mentioned to my doctor simply that I've been running out a bit early because once in a while I may take a third pill. So now, I'm not really in any position to ask if we should up the dosage or amount of pills monthly.

I lay awake hour after hour just... thinking.

Honestly, dating is the worst fucking part of this. My inattentiveness and lack of social skills has honestly gotten me so down I don't even bother with women anymore, not that I don't want to, just all the recent negative experiences have made me completely give up.. I can't begin to explain how many girls I've had interested in me until we started talking. My awkwardness just stands out and repels people.

It's flat out impossible for me to carry out a real conversation, and whats really sad is it didn't used to be..

That light at the end of a tunnel? It's a train heading right for me, etc etc. I've just been in this incredibly negative funk that I can't shake.. And over the last 5-6 years, it's **destroyed** me as a person.

These days if you catch me at a party I'll be the guy standing in the corner, either on the phone or looking at the ground, with nothing to say and zero conversation skills.

Today was my first day using ADHD medication and it was a godsend. I'm truly hoping with the aid of this medication and some patience I'll be able to build some semblance of a social life.

I've been reflecting a lot on my ADD lately, how it effects me, what symptoms I can attribute to it, and what I can do to improve myself. The more I think, and reflect, the more I realize that this has gotten progressively worse over time.

When I was young, like 7 I could pay attention to things for hours at a time non stop, I was able to dedicate hours to practicing and exploring things just for the sake of self improvement and curiosity, and other than some hyperactivity I was a normal, well-rounded kid who did normal kid things. 

Now, I can't even sit through a tv show without realizing that my mind has wandered somewhere else and I haven't absorbed anything.

I live in Utah, if that has any significance.  My parents are divorced, and I live with them each 50/50, week by week.

**I think I have ADHD Combined Type, moderate.**  I wrote an essay on ADHD a few months ago and discovered that I match almost every symptom, so I did some more research... A *lot* more.  I would consider myself quite knowledgeable on the subject by now, and my opinion that I have it has only gotten stronger.  It explains so much:

* It feels like I have a million thoughts going on at once.  Sometimes it feels like my thoughts are bouncy balls and they are just bouncing all over my cranium.  Kind of like having multiple radios on at once.

* I have trouble keeping my attention on a task for more than 20-30 minutes at a time.  Sometimes less.  It feels like with anything that I don't want to do it takes me three times as long as a normal person because I stop doing it and just zone out or start doing something else unintentionally.

* I can't keep still to save my life.  I mean, I have tried making conscious efforts not to shift position or shake my leg or zip and unzip my sweatshirt zipper, but then I realize that I haven't been paying attention to anything else that entire time.

* I talk a lot and really fast.  Almost every conversation I have usually ends with me walking away regretting something that I impulsively said without thinking.  I lose my train of thought a lot mid-conversation and often trail off as I'm talking if something else catches my attention, or I rapidly change subject.  I also zone out when people are talking and I'm uninterested.

* I zone out for long periods at a time, especially when I'm bored.

*  I am incredibly forgetful.  I forget what I was thinking about minutes before, forget things I need literally everyday, and usually I forget all about homework assignments, or really any project, pretty regularly unless I write it down.

* If I don't write it down I will forget to do it, and if I don't schedule it I just *won't* do it, and I'm not sure why.  I have this planner, and it basically runs my life.

Well, there are a lot more symptoms that I match, but I feel like that list has gotten long enough.

**My school history**:

* *Elementary school* : Got good grades in general, although my math grades really could have used some work.  I got in trouble a lot (by 'a lot' I mean that my permanent record is stuffed with detentions and referrals), mostly for things like getting out of my chair at inappropriate times, making noise during class at inappropriate times, and questioning my teacher.  I also got in trouble a lot for not paying attention.

* *Fourth grade*: my teacher mentioned at a parent teacher conference that I struggled paying attention in class and my eyes had a tendency to wander.  She didn't specifically say that she thought I had ADHD, but she mentioned multiple other ADHD relatd behaviors that she was concerned about.  My parents basically shrugged it off.

* *Middle School* : 6-9 grade my behavioral issues in class subsided a lot, and I didn't get in trouble hardly ever.  My grades still remained decent.  Around an average of 3.7 GPA.  My struggles were mostly in math and history ( my least favorite classes), but I got by with Bs in my hard classes and As in the ones that I liked.  

In 9th grade school started to get harder for me because it started depending a lot more on homework and studying rather than just being there.  By then it wasn't just math and history troubling me, but also science (biology).  I continuously forgot my assignments in biology and ended up plagiarizing several the period before they were due.  I ended up plagiarizing our first quarter final research paper and... I got caught.

Big mess of issues with the administrators later, and I ended up with my first ever C.  I pulled it together the rest of the year with my parents reminding me and even forcing me to do my homework.

* *High School* :  This is my first year at the high school, and I'm a tenth grader.  This year I got my lowest ever GPA in second quarter, with a 3.5, although in first quarter I got a 3.8.  I struggled only with physics, math, and history.  I got a C+ in second quarter for physics.  My average for physics is a B- from the three quarters, a B in math, and an A- in history.

**The thing is, I don't feel like I'm not trying.**  I easily study three times as much as the other kids, with half the results.  With the push of my parents and my extensive scheduling I am now able to complete all of my assignments, however I struggle to pay attention in class and usually teach myself everything at home.  My parents got me a tutor for physics and math to help me get the education I miss during class.

**So I tried to explain it to my parents**:

* Dad: he agreed that I may have ADHD, but I don't think that he really gets what ADHD is, and he seems perfectly content to let it remain undiagnosed.  I mean, he would take me to get diagnosed if I asked him too, I'm sure, but without my mom's support he probably won't go for it.

* Mom: Here lies my main problem.  I tested the waters first by just bringing up ADHD as a disorder in conversation, and I received a firm, ""ADHD is a bullshit disorder for hyper kids.  It's just an excuse to get ritalin and adderall.""

I was pissed by the misunderstanding of it all, so I made an effort for the next few weeks after that to help her gain an understanding.  In the end, I think she agreed that ADHD was real, although it *Was* overdiagnosed.

Well in any case I had her convinced that it was real, so I figured now I ought to bring up that I think I have it.  Yeah, I got a very negative response to that.  Basically, I have a 3.7 GPA, so I can't have ADHD.  I'm a little high strung is all, apparently.  

_____________

So basically I don't know what to do.  I can't go behind my parent's backs and talk to a councilor, nor do I want to.  My dad probably will be unwilling to get me diagnosed without my mother's consent, and even if he did take me to get diagnosed I worry that it would increase tensions between my divorced parents and I don't want my mother thinking that I'm some sort of drug-addict-liar.

**TL;DR** I guess my purpose in writing this was mostly just to get it off my chest, and maybe get some advice if anyone has it.  In a nutshell, I think I have moderate ADHD-C.  Unfortunately, my grades throughout school have been mostly As and Bs with a few Cs thrown in, although I got in trouble a *lot* when I was little.

i am beginning to believe there may be a market/need for an adhd store which would sell the latest things for getting organized, motivated etc.

but beyond that i also see it as a meeting place where we could meet and support one another- trade ideas, what works for us, have coffee, relax, meditate, whatever.  

just kind of open up conversation about it and remove the stigma of a diagnosis.  i really like myself adhd and all, i want that for others also, its tough on the self-esteem when younger.

oh yes i am also super fantastic at finding resources for anything and everything especially if money is a problem, i like paying it forward so to speak as many have helped me thru several personal tragedies, so i would work that in somehow.

I have been floating this idea around for MONTHS now. When I try to plan it...**the week flies by** (you all know exactly how that goes) and I don't want to do it Friday/Sat/Sun. So, after 3 hours of sleep and a full day of volunteering....why not! (I really love to volunteer for the ADD non-profit and it gives me energy just like posting in /r/ADHD)

######This will last from 4-5 PDT. If you miss out (but still circle /r/ADHD) then I will notify you of the next one. Would like to have these weekly/monthly depending on how things go.
***
#####Steps 
0. Join Google+ if you haven't (I think everyone with ADHD should use Google mail/calendar...you all do...right?)
1. Put /r/ADHD in your circles (link at top)
2. Sign up for event (might give you a handy reminder)
3. Plug in webcam. Test microphone.
4. Get presentable and clean up the area which will be shown in the webcam (if you want)
5. **Make a name tag** - Recommended. Write your reddit name on a piece of paper or not if you don't want the accounts linked.
6. Set a reminder alarm (I would imagine google will send an email too...this is why I am testing this)
7. Come say hi!

***

Possible things we could do:

* Say hi and share our **wins ** in person-ish
* Each commit to cleaning a small area (in the meantime you can clean your desk/background)
* Show our ADHD systems we have around the house (or half-systems if you all are like me)
* Watch amazing Russell Barkley videos and discuss. Share other cool ADHD-related Youtube videos (no cats please)
* AMA about myself or ADHD (I am an ADHD coach, support group leader, and I do daily meditation/yoga)
* Share different websites/apps/timers/techniques that help us focus
* I could lead a group meditation...
* Go off on a **completely different tangent** and leave the hangout an hour later wondering WTF happened to the last hour of our life...

***

So hookup your webcam. Test your microphone...and let's do this!

***You could join just using a microphone I believe*

Just a little background: I've always considered myself an open-minded individual. I was raised as such. I wasn't instilled with specific beliefs in religion or politics, and while being raised, my parents rarely let their beliefs in such show through to my brother and I. So by the time I hit adulthood, my beliefs in such matters were shaped by other experiences as opposed to what my parents taught me. As such, while I often find people with views counter to my own in such serious topics, I try my best to see where they're coming from and why they believe the way that they do, even if they don't do the same. While I don't consider this to be 100% emotional, I consider it to be a form of empathy all the same.

Now.. I've always had ADHD. I'm now 23 and was officially diagnosed and received medication for it about a month ago, in the form of Vyvanse. It's helped me a lot. I have a lot of minor side effects with it that seem to be mellowing out. The minor euphoria I received when first taking it is all but gone. Appetite suppression is still there, dry mouth as well on occasion, and the sex-drive suppression. Otherwise it just helps me see all tasks and such as much-more-easily surmountable than before I was on it. From simple tasks like doing the dishes like complex tasks like transferring all my computer hardware from one computer case to another (then reformatting because it fucked up some how). 

One other odd ""side-effect"" I've had is a very noticeable increase in my ability to be empathetic towards others. Being apologetic in arguments/debates and such even when it isn't necessary. Going out of my way to be nicer to others. Even going so far as to be a mediator for my parents while they're going through their marital problems, in attempt to facilitate better discussion. Even when I think one of them is ultimately in the wrong. During the discussion specifically: if one of them took something the other said the wrong way, I would help them understand why it was actually said and where they were coming from when they said it. It was weird. At the end they said I should become a marriage counselor. 

So.. Anyone? Assuming someone was able to sit through that wall of text?",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,False,,,True,t3_1jvwwq,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1jvwwq/vyvanse_a_noticeable_increase_in_empathy/,

Or worse---have ADHD him or herself, since whether or not one is afflicted has a strong link to genetics. It seems so irresponsible.  


I'm a 30 year old woman with ADHD.  Although I was diagnosed in middle school and again in college, my parents are convinced ADHD does not exist (they think it's one of many disorders made up by pharmaceutical companies to increase their bottom lines) and fear mongered/guilt tripped me into not seeking treatment (the meds will screw your mind up permanently, you're just spoiled, lazy, selfish and irresponsible and looking for someone or something to blame for your shortcomings, etc.) so things progressively got worse until a few weeks ago, when I decided to look into my treatment options.

In any event, I recently became engaged to my boyfriend of three years.  Instead of feeling overjoyed about it, I am racked with anxiety.  I love my fiance and he is great for me, but I am terrified of being a wife and a mother.  Shortly after the engagement was announced, my mother sat me down and basically told me I need to grow up and get my **** together because children need reliable parents and I am anything but.

I see that most people my age are much more established in their jobs, social lives, families, etc. but achieving those things seem like an impossibility to me.  If I can't even keep a job, show up to important things on time, find important documents, remember important things to do, and keep the chaos at bay, how the hell could I raise a child?  I've lost many friends by repeatedly failing to do things they counted on me to do and/or showing up late to extremely important events in their lives, causing disruption.  Obviously a marriage and children require even more participation than a friendship, and that is incredibly daunting.  I can't bear the thought of someone being married to or raised by me and having to deal with decades of let downs and chaos.  Or worse---have ADHD him or herself, since whether or not one is afflicted has a strong link to genetics. It seems so irresponsible.  

Is this a common reservation/fear of people with ADHD?  I hear about the high divorce rates of couples with ADHD in the mix.

I am 13 years old and have ADD. Naturally, I have problems paying attention, but I also seem to lack the ability to follow routines until they are drilled deep into my thick skull. My dilemma is that I have terrible grades in school. I am what most people would consider a pretty smart guy. I can learn in class, and put what I've learned on a piece of paper while I am in class, but I can NEVER do my homework. I don't know what it is, but for some reason my mind can unconsciously justify not doing the work and putting it off. Also, it isn't just school work I have this problem with, it is everything. When I am teaching myself how to play the drums, my mind jumps and I end up never accomplishing what I sat down to do. When I am browsing the internet, I constantly get sidetracked in other tabs. Something just doesn't click for me...




So, here is where you guys come in. I do not want to take any medication for this. Having ADD is is part of my build as a person, and the medicine, quite frankly, makes me feel like absolute shit. So, what are some tips for overcoming this naturally? My grades are going down the toilet and I am going to highschool next year. I really need the help. ANY ADVICE IS APPRECIATED. I can't stress that enough.


Feel free to ask any questions if needed. I really just want to sort my life out.

1365270915.0,26,self.ADHD,1bt0pv,Hi everyone! Reading your posts has made me feel comfortable enough to post my own interpretation of ADHD *warning: I cussed a bit.*,katlyketheef,32,6,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1bt0pv/hi_everyone_reading_your_posts_has_made_me_feel/,"Hi guys. I've been lurking here for awhile and I finally feel comfortable enough to share something I wrote a few months ago. Writing is sort of my outlet, and I always feel like a weight has been lifted after I do so. 

I apologize in advance for the length, but I feel like maybe some of you will really be able to relate. This is my first big post, so please be gentle. 


""This is what it is.

Its a fog. Its starting and stopping, remembering and then forgetting it all, all over again.

It’s paranoia and frustration, believing that i’m stupid for awhile and then remembering that i’m still smart, just a little dysfunctional. It’s the little things that no one cares about, that I wish I could fix. It’s my weight, my behavior, my lack of commitment to anything.

It’s believing in myself one minute and then remembering why I hate myself the next.

Stop fucking saying that it’s not real. You have no idea what it’s like listening to some people tell you that medicating yourself for something that you struggle with is not okay, and other people being somewhat understanding. It’s like bringing politics up in a crowd of strangers. 

You don’t have a right to have an opinion about the struggle until you’ve experienced it first hand.

I’m smart, and yet I can’t think. How the fuck do you explain that? I get windows of time where I can do anything, be anything, complete anything, and then those windows close and I’m in the dark again. Everything stops, i’m back at square one, and I hate myself a little more each time.

I don’t like to complain, I don’t want anyone to know that my brain is literally running at all times. 
It doesn’t take a break, it doesn’t stop. I can’t stop it. So when you complain because i’m over thinking something, its because I cannot turn it off.

You think i’m neurotic? You would be too if your fucking brain wouldn’t shut up.
You think that i’m a hypochondriac? Try getting diagnosed with a disorder at 6 fucking years old, and having the unending anxiety accompany that. Then shut the hell up.

You think that I need to calm down? Really? Me too. I wish I could. I’m not gonna smoke weed, I’m already on a drug to keep me focused. Being high all the time will only make me hate myself more.

Did I miss that detail? Thats because I don’t see time like you do. You see it as a chain of events, I see it all as NOW. I have to get things done NOW. You know why? Because I’ll FORGET. I always forget, I don’t want to forget, so I did my best and missed a detail. I’m sorry.

Imagine looking at everything all at once. I’m not talking about your surroundings, I’m not just talking about your “to do” list. I’m talking about everything in your life. When you have one thought, instead of it being clean and condensed, it’s literally accompanied by everything in the world that could relate. When you think about getting groceries, you think about going to the store and buying groceries. I think about which grocery store, what time i’m going, if i’m going to be able to run other errands, what list i’m going to make, whether or not I will have enough money, If I should wait until someone can go with me, If i should clean out the fridge first to make room, If there’s going to be that same check out girl who always gives me dirty looks. 
I think about all of that, AT ONCE. Now imagine that kind of thought pattern for everything, hitting you at once. Imagine trying to get all of those things done at once, because if you don't, you’ll forget half of the details. Then you find yourself at the grocery store with not enough money, or forgetting that lunch date with your friend because of all that space was taken up in your brain... over grocery shopping. I can’t do anything without experiencing some kind of anxiety about the unplanned details. Don’t tell me I should fix it, or that I should get over it, because I can’t. You fix your diabetes, or your blindness. Get over it.

I ruminate, I can’t leave anything alone. I have to turn everything; every situation, every undecided moment, in my head until I understand it. 

Some people say that people with this disorder are gifted, which I agree with to an extent. But it doesn’t take away from the fact that I wish I could just be normal and commit myself and not hear people tell me i’m making excuses. I want to be good, I want to be better, but my brain just isn’t wired like yours. 


I’m sorry if I zoned out on you in conversation. I understand that to most there is no excuse, but It’s literally like listening to two people at the same time. Have you ever been in a conversation and one person will not shut up and you’re trying to listen to the other, polite person in front of you? It’s impossible. Sometimes I can get that rude person in my head to shutup, but by the time i do, You’re already done talking and i’m too upset with myself to ask you to repeat yourself.

I’m sorry if I missed our date, our plans. I love you, You’re my friend or family, I care about you more than anything in the world. I don’t know if this has to do with ADD, but my biggest issue is that I feel completely happy and content to see someone when I make plans with them. THen when the time comes down to it, I literally feel like a different person. An angry, tired, depressed person. I want to hide that person from you. I don’t want to come to starbucks with a grumpy look on my face, unable to focus on our conversation and thus looking like a jackass because I can’t listen. I will zone out on you, and I love you too much to do that. But I promise you i’m trying. 

I’m sorry if I take my time. Please don’t assume I’m selfish, but i’m honest to God not ready. It took me a long time to understand that sometimes you just have to do things. Because I grew up thinking about them, and thinking, and pondering, and thinking. When I finally got to a point where I couldn’t think anymore about it, I would do it. But the reason is because i’m afraid of failure. I dont want to let you, or myself down. Because I couldn’t handle it. I couldn’t handle seeing you so disappointed in me. Not knowing if i should blame myself or the disorder. I promise you that 9 times out of 10, I am blaming myself. 

I’m sorry for everything I’ve ever done to any of you. I love you all so much, to the point that I don’t want you to be disappointed in me. I can handle my own disappointment, but I can’t handle seeing you look at me and instantly feeling idiotic, stupid and depressed all over again. Because many can brush that kind of thing off after awhile, but I never forget those looks.

1363837491.0,31,self.ADHD,1apnd1,Some tips for dealing with the academic world and ADHD,meeplepie,39,8,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1apnd1/some_tips_for_dealing_with_the_academic_world_and/,"This is my first text post on reddit, so I apologize now if I've screwed it up. In messages with another user, I came up with this list of coping mechanisms that got me through my engineering degree before I had my ADHD diagnosis. It was suggested that I should post it here in case anybody else could maybe benefit. I'm really new to the ADHD thing, so sorry if some of this is obvious or a common suggestion. This is also going to be hella long, so please bear with me. Here are the things I did to keep myself organized and on top of the work load:  


- Make Sure: Before you switch majors or before you choose one, book an appointment with the department head for the discipline you want to get into. Write a list of questions to ask so you can ensure that this is a field that truly falls withing your interest. Without that, it will be much more difficult to sustain an effort and get through it.  


- Day planner: This thing is a must. Write down every due date for every assignment AS SOON as you get it. Ditto for test, exam, lab dates, anything you need to remember for a certain day. And check that sucker often. Every time you sit down to do some work.  


- Binders: Keep binders for each ongoing course. If you put multiple courses in one binder, get some good separators. Keep paper in it to take notes (and a spare pack in your bookbag), and get a hole punch to keep in your bookbag so you can put any assignments or handouts into the binder as soon as you get them.  


- Prioritize: As soon as you get home everyday, take 5 or 10 minutes and go over whatever was assigned or scheduled that day. Do this as soon as you get in the door. Before you get a drink of water, before you do anything except take off your coat. Otherwise you are more likely to forget or put it off. Read through any assignments you got or tests that were scheduled, and estimate how long you will need to complete it or study for it. This is really hard at first, but as you get to know the coursework and professors, it will get easier. It will probably never be exact, but a general idea is good. Write down the estimated time to complete in your day planner next to the part where you marked the due date. Every time you sit down to work, look at that information and just having it there will help you figure out what needs your attention first. Doing this in the off-time spares you the panic when the due dates start rolling around.  


- Scheduling: Set a schedule for yourself for your out of class work. Be realistic, don't set 5 hours blocks of time for studying. Study in shorter bursts. For example, I would study for an hour and then break for 10 minutes. Having a timer on hand really helps with this. Don't use your cell phone, you know how that will end. I found that although I could almost never follow the schedule exactly, it gave me a general idea of what I wanted to do, so I would have an idea when I sat down instead of aimlessly scrabbling to figure out what needs to be done. It helps to do this at the same time that you go through your assignments etc. and estimate how long each one needs. Allow yourself a little leeway in the scheduling because you're not looking to set yourself up for failure. Take your estimate time to complete and add a buffer that you deem to be comfortable wiggle room. Sometimes I would allow an extra half hour, sometimes an extra two hours. If you finish early, don't stop, move onto the next thing instead until your schedule for the day is completed. The point of scheduling is not so much to do everything at the exact specified time, but rather to make sure you get what needs to be done finished every day. Schedule yourself days off. This is crucial! It's very easy to burn out and you're no good to yourself if that happens. I would generally leave my schedule for Friday evening and all day Saturday blank. This obviously changes during exam time, but the rest of the time it is very important.  


- Study Groups: Get a circle of dependable buddies as fast as you can! At my school we did a lot of group work, so I hope other schools would be the same. Having group work or a focused group of friends that will be getting together to work on stuff will keep you on task. Not only that, but you can help people out with stuff you're good at, and they will return the favour. This is even a good idea for ""solitary"" assignments, as you can still work through them together. Use your hyper-focus to your advantage in group work. When the group is splitting up tasks, volunteer to do the parts that really interest you and you will do an amazing job on them!  


- Stick Around: Staying at the school after classes is prime time to get some work done. The computer labs and library (at my school, anyways) are usually much emptier, and the people who are typically there are the people who are super focused. Just by making myself stick around, even for an hour or two, I felt more productive and inspired by being surrounded by focused people. Plus, causing distractions makes you feel like a jerk so you're less likely to do it! You're closer to resources and have a lot fewer distractions than at home.  


- Set Goals: When I would stick around at school, work at home or meet up with a study group, I would always (after checking the handy dandy day planner), set a goal or two for the session. This takes a fair bit of willpower to abide by, but the payoff made me feel like a million bucks so I found it got easier with time because of that. Pick an assignment to do, or a chapter to learn, whatever. Tell yourself over and over that you're not leaving until it's done. The hardest part is holding yourself to it, but if you're stubborn like me, you almost want to do it just to spite yourself and prove that you can. Don't go overboard with huge goals, set small, realistic goals. If you have a big project to do, when you do your estimating of time to complete, break down each assignment into smaller steps and mark those in your schedule instead of just the whole assignment. If you do this, make sure to mark out which assignment the steps correspond to. I made that mistake a few times and ended up with a jumble of work that I didn't know what went where. If you have two goals, one that is really interesting to you and one that is not, do the boring one first. Then the exciting one is like a reward and you are less likely to wander away from the boring one.  


- Distract Your Hyperactive Side: Whenever I would study at home, I would sometimes find it hard to focus because it was so quiet and nothing was going on, so I would seek out distractions. This never ended well for my grades. I started doing things to distract the part of my brain I didn't want so I could focus better on what I was doing. Things like leaving a tv on low volume in another room. Just low enough that you can't make out the words, but it almost tricks part of your brain into trying to figure it out, leaving the rest of your brain alone to get things done. Sometimes I would also go to my mother's house, or a friend's house and just set up there for an hour or two while they had other things to do themselves. This only works if the person whose house you visit will definitely not distract you and understands why you're there. Another way to do this is to play white noise in the background. Some people say music helps, but I find I just focus on that too much to get anything done. White noise was a great solution to calm myself down and focus.  


- Study Often: Studying every day is an amazing thing to do, even just going through the coursework you covered that day. Take 15 or 20 minutes per class and read through and absorb it a little better. This goes a long way! It's also very hard to do, and to be honest, I could only achieve it maybe 20% of the time. But even that was worth it. The best possible way I found to study, and it took me a long time to figure it out, is to write out what I'm studying. It takes a lot longer, but I found that by reading the material and then rewriting it in my own words, I was not only ensuring that I understood it, but by writing it again I retained the information much better than if I was just reading it. Ditto for studying with friends. Teaching someone else something you understand will ensure that you truly understand it, or will help you realize which parts you're not totally good on. I had a problem with looking through things and assuming I knew how to do them. Then when I would try to explain it to someone, I would realize I was missing an important part and that would save my butt. We would work through it together, straighten it out and everybody benefits.  


- Study with Highlighters: I found this to be a great method of getting through studying. As I would study, I would highlight the important parts after I understood them. This makes it a lot easier to go through before a test or exam. Don't go crazy and highlight too much or the effect is lost. Just key words, definitions or major ideas. It helps with how overwhelming pages and pages of material can be.  


- Practice Problems: Almost every math and physics (and everything in between) textbook has them. If the book doesn't, your prof probably does. Don't be afraid to ask for some. Incorporate even just one or two of these into your study sessions. It will help you identify problem areas well before when you are cramming for an exam.  


- Communicate with your Profs: You don't have to tell them you have ADHD, but just keep in touch with them. Don't be afraid to go to their office hours and ask questions. That's what they are there for! If you are sticking around at school to do work, this is a huge bonus: being able to find your profs, or even better, having them see you working after hours in the lab/library. Most profs love this, and when dealing with ADHD, you're going to need to have them on your side. Not only will this show them that you are working your butt off (which pays off when you need that extension or a .5% mercy mark), but it will genuinely help you nail down the complicated stuff.  


- Don't Be Hard on Yourself: This stuff probably isn't always going to work. I still had points where I forgot stuff or couldn't stick to a schedule and all that. I would also feel pretty defeated in those moments, so don't be too hard on yourself if you fall down. The most important part is to not blame yourself and instead put your energy into bouncing back! It is definitely important to your productivity to not beat yourself up and most importantly, don't let that nagging self-doubt in those moments allow you to give up.  


So there it is. These are the things that got me through an engineering degree with untreated ADHD. These skills came from trial and error, so I sincerely hope they might benefit someone else in the same position without them having to figure it all out by brute force. Please feel free to add any other tips you might have or ask any questions if anything needs clarification!

Today at work I had finish doing the monthing billing.  It was never in my job description before, but about a year ago my boss hatched an evil plan to have me take over it.  

It is my *nemesis*.  It is of utmost importance that I *do not fuck it up*.  Historically, I have fucked it up every single time.  I get yelled at.  The stress.  The guilt.  The desperate confusion at where I messed up.  And I try.  So.  Hard.  **I want to do well.**

I ALWAYS mess it up somehow - like, copy something into the wrong line and don't realize it.  Just careless things I endlessly beat myself up for.



So today, I finished it up and checked it all.
**And I did not make one mistake.** 

And I did it so thoroughly too - usually I struggle just to finish it, with tons of mistakes.  I went above and beyond to do a good, thorough job.  Feels good, man.

It is just so absolutely amazing to *finally* do it right for once.

And I felt like I had put in the same amount of effort, if not less than the times before.

**It was like it required the exact amount of effort that it should.**

I'm so happy and its simultaneously kind of depressing, in that i wish i had gotten diagnosed so much sooner.

Feeling the difference in the extra mental energy expended really floored me.  

I feel like I've done an alright job of coping my whole life, in terms of what the outside world sees; and trying to be a normal person.  But I can't help imagining how I've essentially let people down by MY standards my entire life, and that they still put up with me anyways.


And the strain that put on every interaction i've ever had.


I just get mad that I wasn't on medication sooner and, doing a better job of living how I **INTEND** to, not with all the consequences of being undiagnosed.  

And **being as effective as I try to be**.

I'm celebrating the victory.  I know that this is something I just have to move past, and that it isn't productive to regret things that were completely out of my control.  

**TL;DR - A victory over a disproportionately difficult task once finally medicated leads me to wonder how else I could have been doing a better job my whole life, and what that would mean for me, today.**

Anyways, I wrote this more to just get it out of my system than anything.  There has been nothing more life changing for me than seeing so many reflections of struggles in my life on here, and I hope that if you've ever felt this, or are feeling this, that it helps you to know that it isn't just you.

* **[Week 3](http://redd.it/17ngfj)**
* **[Week 2](http://redd.it/176cje)**
* **[Week 1](http://redd.it/16s6pj)**

##### Time Management: Overcoming Emotional Obstacles.

### **Remember:  keep a journal or notebook** *of some sort, and* **write out** *your own personal version of each of* **the take-home exercises.**  *Work on the habits for a week, and then* **BRAG about everything little thing you did *right* in next week’s Win Wednesday!**  

***
#### *Tip:*  **Extend your catastrophic thinking to a ridiculous extreme!**  This is a common type of catastrophic thinking: *”Since I didn’t start studing 30 minutes ago, I’ll never be able to study and I’ll fail the midterm, then have to drop out and end up as a homeless crackhead prostitute...”*  **Take it even further!**  *”I’ll contract some new disease that will infect the world and make us too weak to resist invasion from* ***aliens who will destroy the universe -- all because I didn’t start studying 30 minutes ago.***

***  
***

The fifth session addressed “overcoming emotional obstacles.”  

##### I. The first step in managing and changing feelings of depression and anxiety is to become aware of the automatic thoughts that trigger the feelings.  
1. **Take note of when you have the feelings of** ***anxiety or depression*** -- try to label them (anger, depression, shame, anxiety, etc.) and then ask, “What was I thinking just now?  What were the images or words?”  (You will likely notice many of them are ‘cognitive distortions.’)

2. **Challenge the automatic, distorted thoughts and provide an alternative reasoning** (such as the examples in parentheses):
 * What is the evidence that this thought is true?  *(“Last time I didn’t study as planned, I was so demoralized that I never studied at all and failed that midterm.”)*
 * Is there an alternative explanation?  *(“At that time, I had the worst headcold I’ve ever experienced.”)*
 * What’s the *reasonable* worst that can happen?  *(“I will fail this midterm, and have to talk to the professor or do very well on the final.”)*
 * Could I live through it?  *(“I might panic even more if there’s more weight on the final, but even if I fail that, I could talk to my advisers, rearrange my schedule, and re-take the course.”)*
 * What’s the best that could happen?  *(“I quit wasting time worrying and start studying NOW, and arrange to review with a classmate in the morning before the exam -- I could pass it easily like my last exam.”)*
 * What’s the most realistic outcome?  *(“I call my boss to take tomorrow off, meet with my classmate, and do the best I can on this exam.  I may lose a few hours’ income, but I can maybe pick up a shift on the weekend.”)*
 * What’s the effect of my believing the automatic thought?  *(“I panic and freeze, then don’t study at all, AND lose sleep, which ruins my study plans for the next day.”)*
 * What could be the effect of changing my thinking?  *(“I actually get some studying done, I sleep better, and I don’t have that ‘anxiety’ or ‘depression’ about what I haven’t done.”)*
 * What should I do about it?  *(“I can practice challenging those automatic thoughts -- it can’t waste any more time than my panicking does, and who knows, maybe it will work!”)*
 * What would I tell a friend who’s in the same situation?  *(“Stage fright or test anxiety won’t help you perform better.  Can you write down a list of all the things you need to do, then categorize them by ‘now, later, tomorrow, next week, etc.’ and then focus on the ‘now’?”)*


##### II.  Cognitive Distortions:  
1. **All-or-nothing thinking** or **perfectionism:**  *“If I don’t do this NOW, I may as well NEVER do it.”*
2. **Overgeneralization:** *“I’m bad at EVERYthing!”*
3. **Selective attention:** *”My teacher hated my essay,”* when all he said was the introduction needs rewriting.
4. **Disqualifying the positives:**  You don’t ‘believe’ your friend who says you look nice today becasue you think s/he’s just ‘trying to be nice.’
5. **Jumping to conclusions:**
 * **Mind-reading:**  You assume someone asking your for more information does it because they don’t believe you.
 * **Fortune-telling:**  *“I know I’ll make a fool of myself at the party and have a bad time, so I just won’t go.”*
6. **Personalization:**  *“That person left the room during my speech because I’m boring--it has nothing to do with the food poisoning from the questionable fish some people were served.”*
7. **“Should” statements:**  Don’t use “should,” “must,” or “ought.”  For example, *“I *should* be able to work at top efficiency the entire day.”*  This is inhumanly impossible!
8. **Catastrophizing:**  *“If I don’t get this job, I will never be able to get a job, and I’ll have to move back home with my parents at age 57.”*

What 'tricks' do you have?,DontThrowMeAwayDaisy,37,8,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/132sjm/iama_fairly_functional_adhdpi_of_40_years_who/,"Note:  I'm about to get treatment and see if it helps because I could really use it.

* In my school years I made a point of getting to know my teachers, partially because I was lonely, but also because it made them more lenient.  

* I buy as many of the things I need as possible in huge bulk (six month supply or more), and make a shopping list when I get down to a three-week supply.

* Cruise control.  I won't buy or rent a car without it; it keeps me from speeding or slowing too much; I drive about 7 mph over the limit unless I see signs I need to slow down (like a speed trap, or lots of brake lights) and I haven't had a ticket in fifteen years.

* All my bills pay themselves via my credit card (for points.)  My credit card pays itself--in full--every month from my checking account.  I keep a few extra thousand in my checking account just in case.  I'm losing some money on investment interest I could be making, but I'm saving oodles on late charges for the bills I would otherwise forget.

* I was diagnosed in college but they didn't treat me for it (expensive, and they were worried about my entirely-not-irrational depression at how I was flunking out.)  I did get to take my biggest exams in a quiet room, alone, with an extra hour.  My scores jumped from Ds to As from just this.

* I, er, flunked out and joined the military.  At the lower and middle enlisted ranks this was very very good for me; I got sunshine, forced socialization, forced exercise, forced schedule/routine, and a steady paycheck.  This helped me immensely.  In the later ranks I had more and more paperwork to do and am starting to founder; I'm trying to get sent out somewhere operational where I don't have to spend all day at a desk filling out reports and doing other things that are my personal hell.

* Social interaction was hard for me because people are boring and, well, I alienated most of them as a kid.  I made a point of faking it; I would sit down with anyone I saw sitting alone (with their permission) in the cafeteria, introduce myself, and make conversation while I ate.  I would ask them questions about themselves.  Normal people often don't have hobbies, haven't read books lately, and so on, but they've watched movies, they did something last weekend, maybe they played a video game, and so on.  If you ask people questions about themselves and let them talk?  They'll tend to like you, because you've been interested in them.  Even if they're only interesting as a specimen of normal humanity.  

I'm not a great person, and these may be very specific to me, but I'm sharing them for what it's worth.  I'll keep this throwaway account for a day or two in case I think of others, and I'll monitor this in case you guys (who may be way smarter or more functional than I am) have better ideas.

Oh yeah:

* I got a run partner.  A workout buddy is the only thing that keeps me exercising regularly.  This exercise is probably helping keep me sane, and we talk while we run; free therapy for both of us.

* I eventually got a Significant Other, and she keeps my bedtimes less erratic; I don't stay up all hours fighting internet addiction or whatever.  I go to bed and I wake up on time.  I started dating her when I turned 26; YMMV.

Good luck, colleagues.

I don't have many more chances left and I'm terrified because it seems like I am simply incapable of being on time. I desperately need ADHD-friendly tips on how to become a punctual person...,IamMorrisTheMoose,30,2,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/s9cu9/i_am_thisclose_to_being_fired_from_my_job_for/,"**TL;DR: The punctuality gods are against me. I need help appeasing them so I can get to work on time and remain employed.**


  *Whoa! Hey there, novel-length wall of text! Sorry about that, you guys. I got a bit carried away but venting about it felt good. While I tried to make it a mildly-entertaining read, don't worry - I won't force you to read it all. The TL;DR gives you enough of a gist of what I'm looking for. The rest is just the details (though I imagine many of you can relate...).*

 
 I hate ""time"". It always seems to fuck me up and I feel like I'm constantly running after it, just trying to keep up (and usually failing at doing so). I just don't get it. I don't understand why the hell it is so fucking hard for me to just arrive somewhere on time. There always seems to be something holding me back or getting in the way, whether it's my own inept brain or external factors beyond my control.


  So, this debility of mine naturally affects my work life as well, and my boss is fed up. Now, it's not like I'm regularly arriving 30 minute to an hour late. I'd say my average is 6-7 minutes late, but nevertheless, this is not okay. I need to arrive 0 minutes late. My god, I hate minutes. and time.
 
 
  Now, once I'm at work, I've often been told by numerous people (including my boss) that my performance is stellar and that I go above and beyond my duties. I am trained in a wide variety of tasks around the office, and therefore I am the go-to substitute for a number of positions whenever that assigned person is out of the office for whatever reason. I am constantly cleaning up and fixing other people's mistakes. I train new hires because I'm good at training and teaching people. This is why they've kept me around for so long despite my tardiness. But for some reason, all of that matters less than my arrival time. And I can assure you that my job is in no way ""time-sensitive"". It's a lot of standing around and waiting around for someone to give me something to do. 


 I wish my boss wasn't such an enthusiast of punctuality, but he is. I haven't told him about my ADHD because he's one of those people who wouldn't understand or sympathize. He thinks I'm just not trying hard enough and that I dont care, but the reality of it is that I damn near have a panic attack every morning in the 30-45 minutes before I have to leave for work because I'm freaking out about being late. It literally gives me the shits, for fucks sake (which is often a reason for my lateness). I feel like his focusing on my being on time and hounding me about it only makes it worse. I'll arrive to work on time for a few days after having a Serious Talk With My Boss, but I inevitably slip for some reason and find myself right back to where I was - 7 minutes late. And now my boss is fed up. I can't be late again. I need help. 



**What the fuck do I do, my fellow ADHD comrades? Some of the strategies I've tried so far include the following:**



 - I set alarms that go off every 15 minutes (and every five minutes the last quarter-hour) leading up to the time I need to get out the door, but I always end up having to do/find/get just one more thing.

- I try to gather all my shit the night before so it's all ready to go but that works for, like, a day before I forget and mindlessly (and nonsensically) spread around my shit like butter on toast. or I'll need something in my neatly organized to-go pile then forget to put it back and by the next day when it's time to go, I forgot what I did with it because odds are I strolled around the house with it in hand en route to god-knows-where, then set it down in the least logical place possible.

- My clocks are set 5-20 minutes early, but I'm no fool and I can easily check my phone to see the accurate time.

- I think about possible consequences for arriving late to work but that just gets me all hot and bothered (and not in a good way) and stresses me the fuck out which, in turn, triggers this subconscious ""avoidance"" mindset and awakens my bowels at the worst time possible. 


- if I do manage to leave on time, then odds are good that I'll run into a funeral procession or an accident, or I'll get stuck behind a vehicle going 10 mph on the single-lane-each-way road to work, or the railroad track barriers will be stuck in the down position so no one can proceed (that's happened twice already), or the road will be closed due to a swat team raid so I have to turn around and take the longer alternate route (it's happened as well).

I was incredibly interested in science by the time I was 5, and I identified by being smart. In 3rd grade my teacher began evaluating me for accellerated programs. I was rejected because of my incredibly disorganized nature. In 4th grade I really began struggling with school, and by 5th grade I was being moved into the ""slower"" math classes for the people who were falling behind. Throughout middle school and high school I maintained C's and B's on average, and never accomplished anything worth mentioning. I couldn't get into a good university because of my grades and lack of experiences. I went to community college and switched my major quite a few times. Afterwards, I did manage to transfer into what most people would consider a great school. I failed my first semester and graduated with less than a 2.5 GPA. What I have managed to do was start my own club at a university, that has over a 2,000 person following (its the most incredible thing I've ever accomplished). It's still a growing club making an impact on the community, and I managed to start it because it was based on my passions. I had to leave it behind though when I graduated, where I am currently getting rejected from every interview I'm gven. I was just rejected today from a fortune 100 company after they paid me to come interview with them. I was so close, but wasn't good enough. I feel like I'm always within arms reach of success, but I can never achieve it. It doesn't help that I am directionless. Everyday I change my life path. The only thing that has stayed constant in my life is my love for music (although I never started playing anything, listening to music is what my life literally revolves around). Music is actually what my club at college was encompassing.

I'm going to a therapist right now. Apparently I'm pretty damn adhd. In my first session my therapist told me that she was confusing my ADHD with bipolar disorder, but that by the end of the session she was FAR more convinced I had an atttention deficit problem, more so than many other of her patients. I hope that with these therapy sessions I can smooth at my wrinkles, and make things happen. And maybe I should start following my passions. I want to work in the music industry using my business degree. Everyone tells me its nearly impossible, and that I should just give up and start somewhere else, but that isnt working out for me either. I'd like to go to grad school too, but I fear rejections from that as well.


Thanks for reading my rant. If anyone has any suggestions at bettering my life, I'd love to try them.

Lots of us have a hard time getting up in the morning, or doing what we need to do in the morning to get out the door in a timely fashion.

### Let's work on our morning routines this week!

Simple things like:

* Put on all of my clothes (including shoes) before I do my hair, that way I can just pick up and go if I realize I'm running late.

  * This one has actually helped me a lot.  Before, I'd spend a lot of time making my hair look right, but I didn't have my shoes on!  Then I'd realize I was running late and I'd still have to do the basics and then I'd miss my train.

* Segregate blocks of time for like activities

  * In my bag I have a tablet, a bluetooth keyboard, a sweater, my screwdriver kit, and a pair of headphones.  Before, I'd be running around packing this stuff up while also getting dressed, brushing my teeth, feeding the cat, etc.  Lumping these activities together has saved time and resulted in a more organized morning.

* If you take public transit and have a smart phone or active computer, make it a habit to check the times until the next bus/train comes to your stop.

 * This one is dangerous, so be careful.  I've often found myself checking the next train time on my phone only to be sucked into facebook or reddit or the chatroom.  But by checking how much time remains until my next train, I have a keen idea of when I need to be out of the door and what I can still do before I head out.

_Not all of these will apply to everyone of course, but these are just a few that I have found useful for my mornings!_

Share what has worked for you to inspire others, tweak existing routines to be more efficient, come up with brand new things to do if you find yourself with some free time!

If you want, break down your morning from when you wake up until you have to walk out of the door and assign activities to specific blocks of time based on _realistic_ predictions of how long each activity will take.

## Keep an eye on the clock throughout each morning.

The best way to gain a sense of time, a sense of how long things take, is to look at the clock before and after (and maybe during).

1364145588.0,27,self.ADHD,1ax61m,"After almost 30 years of living with ADHD, treatment has left me with some feelings guilt and shame.",INeedASecond,31,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1ax61m/after_almost_30_years_of_living_with_adhd/,"Hello /r/adhd

I've been frequenting this sub for a while, and have been trying to get this off of my chest, but haven't quite found the words to put it together.  I made a throwaway so I can be a little more open without as much worry of someone I know in the real world putting this together, as I haven't quite fully come to terms with it all yet.  It helps me to write things down and just get them out, and maybe it will be helpful for someone else.

After dealing with the symptoms of ADHD my whole life, without diagnoses, I finally had an ""a-ha"" moment one day while in class and pursued help.  I was diagnosed with mild OCD and bi-polar disorder at the same time.  Which may or may not be relevant.

I've been on Adderall for a little over a month now.  The first week was rough, but it's been life changing since.  I work full time, go to school part time, am a single dad, and generally have more responsibilities than maybe I should.

Through treatment and the help of tips in this subreddit, I've went from ""getting by"" at work to excelling and taking on more than I ever have before.  I went from behind in both of my classes to ahead and looking at doubling my class load next semester.  I'm getting more stuff done at home and I'm able to relax and spend time with my kid instead of trying to jump from task to task.

However, I've been dealing with a lot of feelings of guilt, mostly because I can now see how my behavior now in comparison to how it was before.  

I've been in a lot of scraps, been married and then divorced, had struggles with my family, and had and lost a lot of friends.  The violent tendencies can probably be chocked up to my surroundings growing up, but lately I feel a lot of guilt about other relationship problems.

Ultimately, I don't think my marriage would have worked out.  Between my ADHD and her lack of acceptance and understanding, I think we would have came to same end had I been diagnosed or not.  That doesn't justify how I was as a person.  I am/was difficult to deal with, moody, forgetful, and inattentive.  Instead of trying to be level with her about things, I was stand offish and kept a lot of things to myself.  Instead of dealing with things, I was just a jerk and shut down.

This pattern has carried through many of my friendships.  I can think of many cases, now, where my inattentiveness has been a burden on some of my closest friends.  Forgetting to call back, forgetting to follow through on things, and generally being a kind of messy person.  My standoffish behavior has turned a lot of friends into enemies.  These are things I never really noticed or thought of before, and now I notice, and I've been thinking about them a lot.

My family life has also fallen into a lot of the same traps.  I grew up without a father and without anyone able to ""fill-in"" the gap.  I feel this has made me incredibly stubborn, brash, and aggressive.  My reaction to family events hasn't really brought me ""closer"" to anyone in my family because of a general lack of empathy and tolerance.  I have one sibling, and we have a very ""rocky"" relationship because of these tendencies.

I have a close friend, who has been with me through everything.  I also have a girlfriend now who has been one of the best things that ever happened to me.  They've both put up with my shit, and been supportive through everything.  They've overlooked my many short-comings and stuck with me through a very rough couple years.

So now I'm in this place of awareness.  I'm aware of how difficult of a person I am and have been to deal with, and more aware of how much I appreciate those who have put up with me anyways.

The question is, where do I go from here?  How do I make amends to those I've hurt and how do I make sure that, going forward, people know that I appreciate them?  It's been a really heavy burden for the last few weeks.

Do I write letters, apologize in person, say a hail mary?  I'm really stuck on this and don't know where to go.  I feel like this is a new chapter in my life, and I want to make the absolute best of it.  Getting ahead in school and work is easy, but making up and getting ahead in life is a much more daunting task.

I also find myself somewhat ashamed of this diagnoses.  Not that there's any shame in it, but because I've been such a jerk about ""not having a problem.""  Only a handful of people know that I was diagnosed or that I've started treatment for it.  To me, the ""amends"" process means admitting that I did in fact have a problem.  I don't know if I'm ready to admit it to anyone what that problem was.

**TL;DR** Did you have, and how did you deal with, guilt after starting treatment for your ADHD?  How did you address the sudden need to make amends?

-It seemed like there was less time in a day (eg. 1hour = 2hours)

-I could fall asleep anytime before 230am, due to 230,000 things running through my head.

I'm a 27, self-employed web developer (i.e. broke-living-with-parents web developer). For many years I had the urge to create a *working* to-do list. I guess staying organised is a dream many of us have. I finally decided to act on it. Probably because I only recently realised I have ADD.

Here are some of my ideas for it:

* super clean, fast and simple (no complicated functionality)
* showing only few tasks at a time (so you don't get overwhelmed)
* not time oriented (i.e. not focused (pun not intended) on *Today*, and *Tomorrow*, etc.)
* tasks easily removed (*the key to productivity is removing things from your to-do lists*)
* rewarding accomplishment (progress bar? fancy animation?)
* transparency and accountability (e.g. by making your list public)

**TL;DR Have ADD. Want to make online to-do list. Looking for ideas to make it helpful to people with AD(H)D.**

PS. Don't you think hosting an ADHD community on Reddit is a bit like running a rehabilitation centre in the Himalayas?

1356893505.0,27,self.ADHD,15okp4,Vyvanse Observations - Two Months,ameangreenbean,33,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/15okp4/vyvanse_observations_two_months/,"I previously reported my observations during my first few days of taking Vyvanse. A Redditor asked that I write a follow up after the ""honeymoon period"". I'm happy to oblige. As a refresher, I'm a 44 male and take 70mg daily. My ADHD is comorbid with GAD and depression.

**What is the biggest benefit I've experienced?**

I'm much less of an asshole to my wife and kids. Before taking the medication I was very uptight and anxious. I felt that I didn't have the time to do the things I needed and wanted to do. I took that frustration out on my wife by complaining that the house wasn't clean or more specifically that I was working harder than she was. This wasn't the case, it was that it took all the mental energy I had to do my job and to chase the dragon (highly stimulating activities and projects).

She'd tell you I'm a much different person. I stop and listen to her and my kids when they talk to me and engage in meaningful and supportive conversation. I'm much more empathetic. Previously, I couldn't focus on conversations. I always felt ""pulled"" by something else that had to be done, even if it was a low value activity.

Overall, I'd say I've seen a +2 to Charisma (for the D&amp;D fans out there).

Although I no longer experience the blissful *high* as I did for the first two weeks or so, I can still focus exceptionally well. I'm able to conceptualize, create and complete work product for my job, school, family and personal projects so much faster than I ever have.

I'd give myself a +1 to Dexterity. I don't think I'm more intelligent, just better able to get work completed.

**What are some of the detriments I've experienced?**

Occasional inability to sleep. At times, I'll go to bed about 11AM, get up at 2AM for an hour, go back to sleep, get up about 7AM. My sleep is not as deep and restful as it had been. I think I can improve this by reducing my caffeine intake, but I'm a bit of a junkie.

Dry mouth for the first few weeks was inconvenient. I just drank more fluids (read Diet Mountain Dew). It was just annoying. In the past week it's nearly gone.

Sexual dysfunction - I could achieve an orgasm but its quality was substandard. It was much like expecting an excellent steak dinner from the finest chop house only to be served a McDonald's Big Mac. This side effect persistent for several week but now seems to be lessening.

Reduction of creativity - I used to be able to leverage my low grade depression to better ""tune into"" or ""feel"" different types of music. I'm a huge music fan and a recreational player in a band.  I have to work a bit hard to feel the music. I sing, play the guitar and to a far lesser degree, the bass. As a vocalist, connecting with the emotion of a piece of music is key. Before medication, I could drop into the mood of a piece in seconds, especially if it was dark. Now it takes a bit more work to be authentic. It feels more like business than pleasure.

On the upside, because I can focus, I'm able to quickly deconstruct songs, solos, etc.

Overall I'd say -1 to Constitution.

**What would I change or what tips do I have for others?**

When I had the flu and was sick for a week I stopped taking it so I could get high quality sleep.

Although I hate breakfast, the medication seems to be more effective when taken with protein.

My appetite has dropped and I have to consciously eat. What I need to improve is eating very nutritious food since I'm not eating as frequently or as much as I used to.

I've stripped away many of the superfluous projects I was interested in. I eliminated as many distractions in my environment as possible. I threw out a ton of crap, organized, cleaned, etc. It was friggin GREAT! I loved doing it. I closed the loop on sooooo many open items. I could write an entire book on this topic alone. Liberating!

The one thought that comes to mind frequently is ""I'm not missing out."" ([credit to Leo Babauta](http://zenhabits.net/39th/)). I now try to do one thing at a time, even if it's just for a few minutes. Sometimes, I find those few minutes have turned into several productive hours. I realized that I wasn't missing out once I stopped compulsively checking e-mail, reddit, etc. In fact, I gained so much more satisfaction from ""playing with one toy at a time"".

Even with how far I've come I still have a problem with putting my thoughts into and easy to follow story. But my point to all of this is that I have ADHD and I went through really hard times yet I somehow made it out on top.
So up until college life was pretty simple and awesome.  I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 5 and ultimately went on meds and ended up graduating in the top 10% of my class and got a really good score on my SAT and in turn got into a really good college.

The summer before my freshman year my doctor said that he would no longer be treating me anymore and I was basically on my own.  By that point I figured that I could handle the ADHD on my own so I didn't argue it.  Unfortunately what I failed to realize was how much different college would be than high school.  It turns out my mother had a huge role in my success in grade school...she was always there hounding me and pushing me to do homework and wake up on time for school etc etc.  Well college started and I no longer had that structure...or any type of structure to be honest.  I started oversleeping, not completing homework assignments, not studying and ultimately failing exams.  I kept telling myself that I would be able to put my head down and push through it but I was dead wrong.  Anxiety and depression started to set in by this point and unfortunately  I continued to fail and ultimately flunked out of school.

This was my first taste of failure and I had never been more devastated..and neither had my parents. It was at this point that my relationship with them really started to tank. I was an embarrassment to them and I could tell...it was an awful feeling and I started to slip into a deep depression. I was constantly being threatened with being kicked out of my house and my parents would yell at me and just flat out told me how much I let them down. It was incredibly painful. At this point I had fallen so low that all I could do was entroll into a junior college and try to get my crap together and hopefully transfer into a 4 year school.

That first semester of jr college was....awful...theres just no other way to say it. I felt like I was surrounded by mediocrity and that I was doomed to just wait tables. On top of that...I was STILL doing bad in my classes. Th depression...the anxiety...my relationship with my family....it just kept getting worse. This was the point where I finally decided to let go of my pride and asked for help. I called around and I found a psychologist who actually specialized in young adults with ADHD. I told him my situation and this is when I learned that he too had originally flunked out of school and worked his ass off and became a doctor and that he wanted to work with me especially and that he would see me once a week and treat me and all of this for free.

My first time actually visiting him and talking to him was really brutal...it was the first time I actually talked to someone about everything I was going through and I broke down right there. I bawled like a little girl and thats when we finally got started. He put me back on meds and counseled me every week like he said he would. Even though I was back on meds, it was a slow start. I still did bad in class at first but other things started coming together.

So fast forward a year and a half....a VERY frustrating year and a half. I was still dealing with depression and anxiety and for the most part my parents had no faith in me and still saw me as a disappointment but this is where things started to change. Every year since I flunked out I would apply to multiple schools, hoping that one of them would give me a chance and of course every single one would reject me. By this point in life I had become incredibly used to rejection and even though it hurt every time I never quit. But this time it was different....every single school I applied to actually accepted me. I remember the day I got all of those acceptance letters I sprinted upstairs to my mother's room and I broke down in front of her over finally being able to go back to a 4 year school. Easily one of the happiest days of my life.

So after a year and a half with my doctor I finally said goodbye but we agreed that I would call him at least once a month and he would still write me scripts for meds. I went off to school and after a shaky on my own I finally found my groove. At first I was really embarrassed around everyone because at the end of the day I still felt like a failure. During my entire time in school I had become so self conscious over the fact that I felt like I was behind so I would never really ever open up to anyone...and on top of that my counselors could not tell me what my predicted graduation date would be...it seemed like the finish line was still out of sight.

Well after getting the ball rolling...it started to roll fast, 2 years later I actually graduated with TWO degrees from a top name school. That was the next time I cried haha. It was embarrassing....I was so proud though. By this time I had already sent out hundreds of resumes and was just hoping for a call back. Like most others who graduated in 2010...finding a job was hard but 6 months after graduation I got a call from one of the largest banks in the country. They actually wanted to interview me. Needless to say, I rocked my interview and somehow got a job. It was at that point...that definitive point that I knew everything was going to be ok. Turns out the job I was offered was one of those ""if you dont take this job you are a fucking idiot"" opportunities. I am now a financial analyst being groomed for portfolio management and I happen to be very good at what I do. The real interesting part was that 5 young guys were hired into this group for the specific reason of being groomed for future management positions and every single one of us has ADD.

I am a year and a half into my job and have never been happier. My parents are incredibly proud of me, I keep hearing about how they constantly brag about me and our relationship is amazing. I have a career now that I can really be proud of. I make really good money, I love what I do and I have a lot of opportunities in front of me. I cant even express how happy I am. No more anxiety, no more depression...just lots of hard work ahead me doing something I really love to do.

I know this is really long winded and I'm sure I left some stuff out. I have to be honest...near the end of writing this my ADD started to kick in hahaha. At the end of all of it though, what it ultimately took was a lot of hard work and knowing when to ask for help. If you have questions feel free to ask.

We have until next Tuesday. I PROMISE I will follow up on you if you give me a time to do so...**

**

Welcome to part II of To Accomplish Tuesday! We had **14 people** accomplish MANY MANY tasks each. ([Check out last weeks thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rg1qf/to_accomplish_tuesday_share_one_thing_you_would/)) **Can we get 25 people this week?** *We can get at least 25 upvotes...right guys (and girls)?*
***
By sharing your goal semi-publically we can keep each other and **accountable**...and **celebrate in our small successes!**

By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more. 

* **Never posted on Reddit before?** I welcome you to make this your first!

***
* **Just put ONE goal.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? 
* **When would you like to finish OR start it by?** By commiting to a date/time, we can check on your progress.
* **Edit your comment when done** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you).
* **Create another when finished** - When you finished your first task feel free to add another! 

***
**Tips**
* Your tasks/goals should ideally be SMART goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound**
* **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable. Study 2 hours is. 

* **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say. Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.
* **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer. Google calendar. Agenda. Write it down so you don't forget. Our working memories are flaky...
* **Start small** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle. Pick a room instead. **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** Commit to studying one hour to make it easier on you..


***
**Examples from last week:**

* Unload the dishwasher
* Pack for moving early
* Email professor
* Study X hours a day (though I suggest starting small with minutes)
* Make an appointment with doctor
* Clean car (get trash out)
* many more....

***

* **What** - ~~I want to **get started on my taxes**. *If I get them done this week my wife said I can buy a DSLR!*~~
* **How much time** - Just 15 minutes
* **When** - Start today. Finish by Saturday.
* **Check in on me?** - Yes. 5 hours from now. 5pm pst. Tired today!

*I installed Turbotax, found out how much I made last year (self-employed) and got tax forms together. Took more than 15 minutes but at least I will feel much more prepared next time!*

**EDIT: update as of saturday oct. 1st: have the FAQ about half-written, just been busy with schoolwork, etc.**

Hey all,

Since the previous mods of /r/ADHD had been inactive for a year, I submitted a request to take it over, and I've been approved! 

The reason I wanted to do this is mainly because I felt the main page isn't living up to its potential. I want to compile a lot of useful information to link in the sidebar, so that all the ""I think I might have ADHD"" posters have a list of high-quality information to start with. I'd like to see this subreddit be both a supportive community and a hub of reliable information. 

My approach to ADHD is one that's fairly scientific and pro-medication. I haven't yet mentally ironed out what my policies will be, but right now I think it will be like this: I may control what links go in the sidebar, but I don't downvote people with whom I disagree. (I might speak out against your ideas in a public reply, though!) As moderator, I have no plans on tampering with anyone's posts or comments, unless you're spreading misinformation to a dangerous degree, or otherwise being a dick. Standard reddit code of conduct will apply, and I'm sure I don't have to explain that.

A note about merging with /r/ADD, because I know people will be asking: my answer is, I don't know how or if that works, but I'll talk to /r/ADD's mods and we'll see what we can find out. I'll update you when I have more to report.

I'm reasonably busy, and this is also my first time moderating on reddit, so I'll have to ask you to bear with me, especially at first, while I get the hang of things and roll out my planned improvements for this subreddit as I'm able.

Having said all that, feel free to start commenting on this post with ideas for what you think should go into our FAQ, list of helpful links, books, etc.! And if you don't mind, upvote this so more people see it!

I was just wondering if anyone else could relate to what I go through on a daily basis with ADHD-PI (or the two other versions of ADHD).

I don't struggle with recognizing emotions, I struggle with matching them. I can always tell when someone is sad, happy, or angry. I'd even go as far to say that I'm fairly decent at predicting what's going to happen based on the mannerisms that a person is exhibiting. However, my problem lies with being emotional when anyone comes to me with a problem or accomplishment. I can feign emotions quite well, but it's quite rare when I actually do feel something. Also, the few times that it's happened, I don't know how to deal with them and whatever I'm feeling is painted all over my face  and I can't hide it at all. 

Also, before taking medication, I struggled with everything that didn't have a goal that I could see outright. For example, I played soccer in high school because I could see the ball and see the goal, but I couldn't even fathom why people did cross country because those runners were competing against a clock and had to run miles before seeing the finish line. I bring this up because I think it's a perfect analogy for how I performed academically. I knew the goal was to get into a good college, but I couldn't see it immediately so I didn't really try. Just putting it out there, I scored in the 95th percentile for the ACT and the SAT, yet I graduated highschool with a cum. GPA of 2.5.

I've also always struggled with dating. It's hard to convince myself to actually go after someone because of issues with self esteem (although I'm in pretty decent shape). And then when I do, I lose interest, particularly when it's become fairly obvious that she likes me back..it's quite frustrating. 

A little bit about me, I'm 22 years old, got diagnosed with ADHD-PI just a year ago, and I'm currently taking 36 mg Concerta once a day. I can honestly say the medicine is fantastic and has changed my life in terms of patience, grades, and paying attention in classes (rarely do I fall asleep during lectures). Also, if anyone is looking for a good app for exercising (running has always been super boring for me and I just never feel like doing it for extended periods), I'd like to recommend 'Zombies Run!' and 'Zombies: 5k'. It's got a storyline to it and has helped me stay motivated in running on a regular basis. Cheers! Thanks for reading/replying!

TL;DR
I have ADHD-PI, was wondering if people struggle with motivation, emotion, dating and things like that. Also, would be interested in finding out any tips you use to focus, adjust, and deal with ADHD-PI without medication

edit: My family pediatrician suspected I had ADHD-PI when I was in 8th grade but my parents brushed it off because one of my teachers said I was just being lazy and it was my fault for my grades (interestingly enough, if you look at my GPA, you'd see me learning how to compensate over the years, 1.5 in middle school, 2.0 going into HS, 2.5 graduating HS, 3.0 in college).

Doctor Barkley talks about delayed consequences and being unable to see the future until it is right in front of you.

According to him, self-control is not something you learn, and ADHD is not something I have to overcome but to deal with. I have to make an extra effort, be accountable and not excuse myself.

He talks about implementing artificial consequences to make up for the delayed ones. I understand that these consequences have to be more frequent than normal consequences, and that they always have to be present, kind of like a prosthesis.

How can I learn more about implementing artificial consequences? What can I do with them -on my own or with someone else's help- to help me with my procrastionation/inattention?

I've always been easily frustrated by things that normally wouldn't / shouldn't frustrate people (as far as I know) 

**Examples:**

* Red light after red light on the morning bus to work - resulting in being late for work; again.
* Internet problems at home that causes my internet to disconnect about 20 times a day for about 1-5 minutes at a time.
* My neighbors loud ass Harley.  
I live close to down town, so it is very loud in general, but this bastard keeps on revving his engine. I literally want to jump out the window and punch him right in the nuts.


This isn't the first time I've noticed that I get these tantrums. Looking back at it I had this as a child too, but it wasn't severe in any way and blew off quite fast.
I often get extremely frustrated over the little things. They piss me off, and I don't know why.
I dislike being angry, it's not who I want to be.

Not sure if it's related to the Ritalin or not, but I know for a fact that it's not an optimal medication for me. I just hope that I'll be able to switch over to D-amphetamine soon. Ritalin is definitely not working as well as I initially thought, and hoped. At higher dosages (60mg a day instead of my normal 40mg) it does nothing other than give me a little extra energy boost, but I also think it's causing some tension.

Ritalin does work to some degree if I've gotten enough sleep (8+ hours). Even though I'm currently prescribed 40mg (Ritalin LA), 60mg is definitely best for me. 20mg morning, 20mg lunch, 20 mg afternoon.

It just doesn't make any sense. I will reach out to people, and often times I get nothing...literally nothing. I will make an effort to be friends with someone and they don't seem to reciprocate. I thought people wanted to be social? I am an awesome fucking dude, yet joe shmoe over there who is ten times the loser I am gets more fucking attention than I do. Not to mention girls actually talk to him, and don't ignore him as if he doesn't exist.

You know what I think it is? COMMUNICATION! Having ADD for me is bad enough but I am able to communicate properly and let people know the real fucking deal so they know what I am thinking and feeling without any retarded assumptions. I consider myself a good communicator and I think normal people with their stupid filters and shit don't know how to communicate. They do, but they don't socialize the way we do in which both silence, and talking is golden. As long as time is spent well and together with others. 

I hate how normal people assume things. They assume that you are this, or that, when in reality they don't even fucking know you well enough. I just grinds my gears and humans are social creatures so having a good social life is intrinsic and healthy for human kind. Also people rarely invite me to things. It is like they forget about my existence and it makes me feel like a worthless piece of shit.

Sorry this is kind of a rant but as a human who knows that social life is incredibly important, having ADD makes it that much worse. Now being friends with other ADD'ers is perfectly fine. In fact my relationships with these people are more healthy but it still does not change the fact that I feel so alone sometimes. And I hate it.

When I graduated from high school, I tried to follow a university course about Psychology. I failed, since I just could not put myself to work. Around that same time I was put into a therapy group with other young adults  who had depression and anxiety disorders just like me. (to be more precise, I have Dysthymia (a mild chronic depression disorder), social anxiety disorder and a avoidance personality disorder).

I went to a new school about game design, where I still reside on now, and tried to make the best of it. But also there, I delivered everything at the last possible moment, even skipping some lessons. Luckily I had a school councilor there who cut me a lot of slack due to my mental disorders. But school right now still isn't going great for me. I can't concentrate and focus on my homework. 

I did the therapy group for about 2 years and have now stopped.

That's a bit of my history. Now my current problem:

About a month ago, I was offered a freelance job that would earn me around 1500 euro's, which is a lot of money for a poor student like me. I need to make a couple of digital video's for a company in order to earn that money.

But, the problem is, is that I just cannot put myself to work on this. This is not something that is new to me. I have struggled to work on important things like school or other things that would earn me lot's of money. I put them off till the last possible moment, and deliver a thus mediocre job.

This is really frustrating. I know exactly what I have to do, but I get distracted very easily (by the Internet mostly). 

For example, I would start up my video editing program, would start up Youtube so I can start a playlist with my favorite music aaaaaaaaaand my attention is gone from my project. I now browse Youtube for about 30 minutes, which brings me to new stimuli that I get distracted by and before I know it it's 3 hours later.

Another aspect is a very sickening feeling when I try to go against this feeling and try to work on the project. But it makes my stomach twist. I suddenly really really really don't want to work on the project. This is strange, since when I now think about the project, I love video editing, I love to create something from scratch. 

So for about a month now, I have tried and tried and tried to work on this project. But I haven't gone past some words written on paper about how the video needs to look like. This video is due next week, and it's far from finished. I basically haven't even started yet.

This week I went to my doctor, explained to him my lack of concentration for the past 4 years. He told me I might have ADD. So I am going back there next week to test for ADD. He said that if I have ADD, I would probably get Ritalin, to help me concentrate.

I really really hope I have ADD, it would explain a lot. I can't live like this any longer. I hate my lack of concentration. I am pretty smart and I want to show it to the world, but right now I just can't. I tried ritalin once, and it made me able to concentrate for 5 hours. I felt euphoric, like I could finally make all the homework I want! I was so happy. But at that time when I tried the ritalin, I still was in therapy, and my group psychologist said to me that I probably don't have ADD, that I should stop taking Ritalin. So I stopped. But I've always felt that something was wrong with me and I feel very strongly that the psychologist was wrong about me too. I think she mis-diagnosed my ADD. I think I have it. I did a few test on the internet that all said I have ADD. Guess I will find out if I have it or not next week at the doctor's office.

Does anyone recognise themselves in the small story I wrote above? I would love to hear your perspectives.

TLDR: Have a big project coming up, want to concentrate, but I just can't. Doctor things I might have ADD, but my previous psychologist doesn't think I have ADD. This make me confused.

Alright, so my grades haven't been fantastic this semester. I constantly pinned this on my ADHD for a few years, but then my mom concluded that I was just being a little bitch who used ADD as an excuse not to do work. She said that if she could overcome her ADD and be the most fucking organized person on the damn planet, I could do my work. (which at this point, I seriously think she was misdiagnosed with ADD because she shows **no goddamned symptoms**)

Here's where I made the fatal mistake.....I believed her.

Enter the worst years of my life. Constant self-loathing, hating myself over my compulsive need to be doing something not productive even though I know I should be doing something else, and even kicking myself (literally) to get my stuff done.

Onto the medicine. One time my mom took my medicine to make sure it was safe for me to take (more reasonable than it sounds, I had been on a medicine that completely ruined my ability to sleep just prior to this medication), and she claims that she felt ""extremely productive"", and actually cleaned the entire house and half an hour. She said that if it could do that to her, I should be able to get my work done.

This time, I did not believe her. I had never felt anything like what she described, and I'm pretty sure she just went full-on wacko on Vyvanse. Despite this, I still hated myself for not getting my stuff done.

I found this subreddit today. I realize now that this is not entirely my fault. My medication doesn't work the way it's supposed to, but that isn't the problem. My mom always told me to ""quit bitching"" about my ADD, but I realize now that those weren't just complaints....those were my cries for help. I've lived with ADD my whole life and my entire family has been everything but helpful about it.

In mere hours, you guys have shifted my entire paradigm about what I'm dealing with now.

My dad is the ""life is hard but you gotta move on and work hard"" kind of guy and has probably never heard of ADHD and would probably never believe such a thing. I told my mom that I suspect that I have ADHD and she said that she suspected that there was something wrong with me. I was very angry at this, why wouldn't she say or do something? She probably also have ADHD but she's self-medicating by drinking lots of coffee and smoking.

I suck at every possible thing that I could suck at at this moment. School, friends, family etc. I've gone to a doctor for help but it's taking such a long time that I feel like I'm living in a third world country (I live in Sweden). I've written a few questionnaires in three months and the ""testing"" will begin in 1-2 months. I can't go to another doctor because there aren't any. I have to go to this particular doctor and I have no choice in choosing another one, wheter I like him or not. I've talked to them if we can speed up the process but they tell me that it's not possible and that two months is nothing compared to what other people are waiting. Two months maybe doesn't sound like a lot of time but I'm not sure I'll live tomorrow.

Last week I told this organisation that I was feeling very suicidal and they made a huge fuss about it and said that I needed to get help immediately (lolwat) and they urged me to go to an acute psychology ward to get immediate psychological help. I was stuck in a ward for 7 hours with nothing to do but drink coffee and eat apples except fooling around with my phone. At the end of it I would have more likely died of boringness rather then suicide. Finally, I talk to a doctor and she asked me if I wanted to be locked up in order to prevent suicide. I politely declined and asked her if I could get medication for ADHD or get some testing done. She said that she couldn't do that and that she could offer anti-depressing drugs. I asked her if it wasn't stupid to try anti-depressions meds before taking care of the ADHD. She disagreed with me and said that I should start them now. I thanked here for her help and politely declined the offer (I was feeling better after eating and drinking liters of coffee at this point). After that I just went home.

She has now contacted the organisation that I should be on anti-depressing meds immediately and they will probably contact me soon. I'm feeling very weirded out because I think I should take care my ADHD before taking care of my depression, but they absolutely refuse this. I'm guessing that Sweden's drug policy is much stricter than America's.

I hate my life and I just can't fucking wait two months before getting help. I was almost got hit by a car yesterday because I couldn't concentrate on the walking lights. I've talked to everyone I could think of and it's always the same: ""just wait, it's not a long time at all, just wait, wait, WAIT"". I feel they are very unsympathetic and I can't get any non-medicated help anywhere before diagnosis.

There is one toher place that does diagnosis for ADHD but they apperantly take even longer time to diagnose ADHD. There are private doctors but the cheapest I could find was one who charged 2000$ for doing a god damn diagnosis.

There is nothing I can do these two montsh except contemplating suicide. I have courses I need to finish and tasks I need to do but I just can't be bothered.

I've told everyone in my family except my dad that I probably have ADHD and everyone was like ""ah, ok"" and they still complain about me being lazy. They didn't even ask for what it does or any research. They just said ""well, you do have little attention but can you stop being lazy for now?"". I've suggested that they read ""ADHD for adults"" by Russell Barkley to understand what's really going on but they all say that they don't want to read it and that they don't need to.

Is there anything I can do except not kill myself and wait for the test?
I've just lost hope of everything now. Can I do something?

Obviously, **if someone is diagnosed with ADHD, they can (and should) use the diagnosis to explain some of their difficulties in life**, such as forgetfulness, concentration difficulties, etcetera: being able to do this is a major part of the reason people get diagnosed. 

However, there is also an obvious limit to this procedure, and **it can become all too easy to use the diagnosis to rationalise undesirable behaviours that have nothing to do with ADHD**, like laziness, stubbornness, and so on. At the absolute extreme, I could imagine cases where someone was using ADHD to justify something like racism or domestic violence.

This problem is made more difficult by the fact that **ADHD can often resemble traits like callousness and laziness, and that there are a lot of ""borderline cases"" where ADHD plays a role but is not the whole story.** Co-morbid conditions are clearly also an important complicating factor to take into account.

**If we want to be able to give a good answer to people who claim that ADHD is ""just an excuse,"" I think we ought to open up a proper discussion about how we can best *avoid* using it as one.**

So, r/adhd, I ask you: **when should we blame ADHD, when should we blame ourselves, and when should we blame other factors entirely?**

A few situations where I think it is particularly important to get clear on this issue:

* social and relationship difficulties
* domestic issues (doing the dishes, tidying up etc)
* proneness to aggression/violence
* addiction
* parenting, both by and of ADHD individuals",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,False,,,True,t3_wmgkx,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/wmgkx/how_can_we_reliably_decide_what_problems_to/,

I have so many things that I absolutely NEED to do but the thing is I genuinely can't be arsed because I know exactly how exhausting it is forcing myself to focus. Even if I do manage to do something it'll still be half-arsed and messy.

Even easy things aren't getting done for example: 
  I keep forgetting to shower and shave yet I HATE not being clean and having facial hair with a passion. 
  A girl I fancy text me yesterday and I still haven't replied even though I definitely want to (probably won't tell her I haven't showered). 
  I keep forgetting to eat and won't eat until I realize I'm trembling and can barely stand up yet I love food. Food is awesome. I even love saying food. 
  I also need to apply for jobs otherwise I'll end up not being able to pay rent and bills although part of that is being scared shitless of interviews, not that I'll get any interviews if I don't apply in the first place. 
  I even thought of posting here last week but never got round to it.

The retainer was a clear plastic color which, to be honest, i couldn't even see without my glasses because it disappeared into the background. It was missing. I looked everywhere.

I did well enough my first time through school, but I know I was coasting on sheer unadulterated bullshit.

I'm happy to report I have a great job, supportive family and girlfriend. 

However, I've been having issues with my relationships lately and I suspect that ADHD and my other learning disabilities may play a role in my behavior. I sometimes feel that I have missed certain social cues that everyone else has managed to pick up on. I was wondering if anyone else has had similar issues, or may have general advice or resources. 

To simplify, I will break down my observations into a few bullets, and I hope others can relate. 

*I find myself much more careful around people I don't know well. I'm more reserved and tend to be shy and mask my true personality. But, as I get closer to people, I find myself being comfortable and I let my guard down. Here, I become more socially unaware. I say things that are unintentionally hurtful, thoughtless, stupid, or embarrassing. I hate the cycle, and it causes me to distance myself from others to avoid the embarrassment.
 
*I seem to have trouble with intimacy and romance. I feel love, but I seem to be unaware of how little I show it. I often forget or miss something that would otherwise be thoughtful. It's as if I need to make a ""to do"" list of how to be a good boyfriend. 

*It takes a long time to adjust to from one social situation to another. If conversation quickly changes topic or emotion, I seem to have trouble keeping up. For example, moving from a joke to a serious discussion, or moving from a confrontation to a resolution.

Kick-Start Sunday is where /r/adhd can share the goals, tasks, or habits we want to accomplish this week.  By sharing here you will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.

*I suggest you read the whole post -- you* can *skip it and just make your list, but you’ll be more successful if you put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*

***
## Choose the participation method that works for you:
* **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)*
* **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)*
* **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**

**Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*

By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)

By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.

♥ ♥ ♥ **Never posted on Reddit before?** I welcome you to make this your first! ☺☺☺

***
## Suggested Guidelines
* **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!)
* **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress.
* **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you).
* **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*

***
## Tips
* Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound**
* **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is.
* **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.”
* **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky....
* **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead.
* **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*

***
## Examples from previous weeks:
* Unload the dishwasher.
* Study X hours a day (though I suggest starting small with minutes).
* Make an appointment with doctor.
* Get ready and *leave the house* for *any* reason.
* Clean car (get trash out).
* **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”
*  many more....

So the other day I made a post about making a productivity app geared towards people with ADHD, and I got an amazing response. 

First, /u/mwd410 has graciously offered to help me with the coding and such - and you can, too. If you're a programmer, you can contribute to the project on Github. Right now there's repos for the [web app](https://github.com/CheesyN4ch0/Focusser) and [desktop app.](https://github.com/CheesyN4ch0/FocusserDesktop) I'll add the mobile app repo later.

If you're unfamiliar with how Github works, what you have to do is: 

- Create a github account
- ""Fork"" the repository, basically creating a copy of the code in the repository I've uploaded that you can edit
- When you're done making changes, go back to my repo and submit a pull request - I'll then merge your code in with the main project. 

Not a programmer? Well, I'm also in need of a designer - logos and UIs don't make themselves. Drop me a line at nachogaminglp@gmail.com and we can talk.

There was some talk on the original thread of a kickstarter campaign - would you guys support this? Having money involved with this project would be a huge help for me. 

**TL;DR: [Github,](https://github.com/CheesyN4ch0/Focusser) kickstarter and web design. Who's in?**

* I make a friend using humour/sillyness as a way to relate
* Deeper things come to the surface and I get bored. ""Do you want to watch TV?"" (after we've tired ourselves out by jumping around like silly fools) is my cue to get the fuck out of there.
* I don't miss my friends who are in another part of the country, scared I'll end up alone. To be honest i don't really care about anyone's wellbeing and this makes me sad. They don't text *me* either, I assume because they're sick of my shit.

    

* I'm gay which limits my options severely, but I'm finding it impossible to find anyone attractive.
* People with ADHD are supposedly really good at picking up patterns and phony-ness in other people's behaviour, which I am super good at.
* Unfortunately it means that people become predictable very quickly and
* As a gay guy, I can tell you that a huge majority of gays wear a mask, gay culture is very bitchy and snobby because of this.
* Being able to see so clearly that they're wearing a mask is very unattractive.    
* Moreover, being the super-intense weirdo that I am, I find myself being very attracted to laid-back guys. Unfortunately gays are often very insecure which makes this almost *impossible*.

Just putting this out there, not sure what to expect. 

TL;DR I need to be shocked in order to find someone attractive. Constantly analysing others prevents this from happening. DAE find people in general boring? I've had one relationship which lasted a year. Ended it after i stayed with his family - there was nothing more to learn.

You will be held gently accountable (which is a good thing!) and we can check in with you...helping YOU get things done.

*I suggest you read the whole post to be MORE successful, so put in the little extra initial effort and continue reading....*

***
## Choose the participation method that works for you:
* **Most important task** - Share one (or a couple) **HIGH-PRIORITY** tasks that you really would like to finally finish.  *(Ex. Set a doctors appointment, finish assignment, clean the kitchen...whatever YOU think is most important.)*
* **Make a list** - Post a list of all the things you want to accomplish this week.  *(I highly recommend identifying the top 3 priorities.)*
* **Feed your soul** - Sometimes by relaxing and having fun we have more energy to get more done. **List a couple FUN items to make your list more exciting.**

**Need/Want to copy last week's list *verbatim*?  Absolutely DO SO!**  *Those might be your keystone habits. Once you start doing those regularly you are able to do more. soon they will be automatic and you can put your focus elsewhere.*

***
By sharing our goal(s) with this understanding community, we can keep each other **accountable**...and **celebrate our successes**, large or small!  **Don’t forget to return for [Win Wedenesday] to flaunt your successes!**  ;-)

By getting one small task done it creates **momentum**, **trust** in yourself, **confidence**, and you will feel like doing more.

***
## Suggested Guidelines
* **Prioritize your list.** One thing you want to get done (or start). What is the most important thing for you? (If making a list works best for you feel free to do that too!)
* **Add a finish OR start deadline.** By committing to a date/time, we can check on your progress.
* **Edit your comment when done.** - Come back and edit your comment when you have finished your goal. We can celebrate that (and then people won't check on you).
* **Small start.** - Share what SMALL (under 10 minutes) commitment you can make towards your goal.  *I found when my clients didn’t reach their goals 90% of the time they never started...this will help you break through the initial barrier.*

***
## Tips
* Your tasks/goals should ideally be S.M.A.R.T goals: **Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound**
* **Measurable** - Make sure you can be able to say YES I DID THIS. **Study enough** is not measurable.  Study 2 hours is.
* **Break it down** - Instead of saying clean my room...it might help to say, “Clean room for 10 minutes or pick up trash in room.”
* **Write it down elsewhere** - Sticky note by computer.  Google calendar.  Agenda.  Write it down so you don't forget.  Our working memories are flaky....
* **Start small...build up slowly** - We want to build on small successes so committing to cleaning your entire house might be a bit too much to handle.  Pick a room (or a task like ‘pick up dirty laundry’)  instead.
* **Want to study for 2 hours a day?** *Commit to studying 30 minutes to make it easier on you.*

***
## Examples from previous weeks:
* Tidy room.
* Kill the Batman.
* Buy car.
* Go to work.
* Attend all my classes on time.
* Reschedule appointment.
* Mornings: brush teeth &amp; meditate.  Evenings: brush teeth, meditate, journal.
* Pay bills.
* Plan vacation.
* Go to the gym 3x this week.
* Break down chores by days so I can have 'a day off with my darling' before he leaves.
* **Start** *[something]*. “Spend 5 minutes on writing my paper.”

After reading Strattera stories from months ago on this forum I've gathered that a lot of people don't like Strattera.

What I've also gathered is that a lot of people who take Strattera don't stick around to see if the side effects go away and immediately label it rubbish due to the side effects. Right now I have some pretty annoying side effects so I would love to hear from those that have been taking it for a good amount of time!

I'm not sure that my experience so far is worth talking about due to the fact that I haven't taken the 80 mg yet (I step up tonight). It's always hard to judge the positives when you are gradually building it in your bloodstream. I have noticed decreased anxiety which in turn is allowing me to handle anger issues and outbursts. I guess as I'm reading Reddit that things don't seem so jumbly. Productivity really hasn't changed much but that ""much"" may be the difference between the meds working and not. A small thing also is that I am looking for a job and an employer emailed me. Normally I'd push it aside and pretend it wasn't there because usually an email means they are going to pass. Well, I went ahead and read it despite a little misgiving and they did indeed pass. However, they said my portfolio looked great and that's something normally a company won't say unless it is true. Heck, most times they won't get back to you at all.

Anyway, my side effects are annoying but nothing too bad. Nothing as bad as some anti-depressants I had taken before. At first some strange dreams (not nightmares) which were actually very cool and artistic. Hard to sleep then crash like a yo-yo. Mostly though is a swollen prostate that is not common on this. I haven't had the trouble urinating but it could be because I'm 30 and enlarged prostate is normal around this age so I already know what frequent pissing is all about. Premature ejaculation happens as well and I""m hoping that will go away. My stomach already sucks so Stratt adds to it. Other than that, nothing major.

TL;DR Thanks, I could just use a Strattera cheering section while I adjust to some minor but annoying side effects I suppose.

EDIT: I have to be away from my computer but I'll check in every couple of hours.

1359382168.0,26,self.ADHD,17ffqt,My insurance required pre-authorization for mental health help. Is this even legal (sources/argument inside) (x-post from r/mentalhealth),LovableContrarian,39,13,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17ffqt/my_insurance_required_preauthorization_for_mental/,"I think I have become pretty ADD/depressed, and I've considered going to a psychiatrist just to get an opinion.

So, I go on my insurance, and this is what I find out:

In order to get mental health care of ANY KIND, you have to call the insurance and basically talk to them at length about your problem, then they decide if you need help, how badly, and where/when you can go.

**Website:** 
https://www.uhcrivervalley.com/Health_Programs/Mental_Health_and_Substance_Abuse.html

**The Important Bit:**
*To get help, members can simply call 1-800-867-6758 (TTY/TDD hearing impaired 1-800-486-7914) to talk to an experienced mental health care professional. He or she will determine the member's needs and will link him or her with a mental health or substance abuse health care professional in that area that is most qualified to meet the member's needs. This is called “authorization.” It helps members get the help they need quickly and conveniently. Remember: Before a member receives inpatient or outpatient services, he or she needs to call UBH for authorization.*

My bullshit alarms started blaring, as it just doesn't seem right. For example: me. I only sorta wanted to go, and this completely turns me off of going. It's enough of a deterrent for people (who probably are nervous/embarrassed about going anyway) to say fuck it and not go. It's hard enough to tell a doctor you are depressed or something. Now you gotta tell some asshole from your insurance over the phone?

Secondly, doesn't this violate some sort of HIPPA/privacy law? The whole thing seems like bullshit.

* How is it legal for them to demand you tell them about your problems? Isn't there some privacy laws preventing that?
* Is there ANY good reason they would do this? Because, the only benefit I see for them is that it will prevent a lot of people from going, which is good for them. It smells like a 100% roadblock with no logical reason to be doing it.

It sorta bums me out. I am a dude who thinks he might have a touch of the ADD, so its just irritating. But, I imagine this bullshit has actually killed people. People get really fucking depressed, and anything that might dissuade them from getting help is criminal IMO.

So... I started googling. And, I found this:

**Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (2008)**

**Some Websites:**

* http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/newsroom/fsmhpaea.html
* http://www.apapracticecentral.org/update/2012/01-12/faqs-parity.aspx
* http://www.samhsa.gov/healthreform/parity/
* https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Health-Insurance-Reform/HealthInsReformforConsume/index.html?redirect=/healthinsreformforconsume/04_thementalhealthparityact.asp

**The Important Bits:**
*On October 3rd, 2008, the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 was signed into law. This new Federal law requires group health insurance plans (those with more than 50 insured employees) that offer coverage for mental illness and substance use disorders to provide those benefits in no more restrictive way than all other medical and surgical procedures covered by the plan. The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act does not require group health plans to cover mental health (MH) and substance use disorder (SUD) benefits but, when plans do cover these benefits, MH and SUD benefits must be covered at levels that are no lower and with treatment limitations that are no more restrictive than would be the case for the other medical and surgical benefits offered by the plan.*

*Plans that require a prior authorization for all mental health benefits but do not require such prior authorization for medical/surgical benefits are applying a NQTL that violates the parity law. Additionally, a plan is not allowed to apply a stricter NQTL to mental health benefits than is applied to medical/surgical benefits.*

NOTE: My insurance DOES NOT REQUIRE any sort of pre-authorization for ANYTHING but mental health.

So... they are breaking federal law, yes?
This is a huge insurance company. Why the hell would they so blatantly break the law? Furthermore, how has this not been taken to court or something yet? The act was passed in 2008... Did they find a loophole? Is this actually illegal?

How should I proceed? Any advice or information would be amazing. Thank you guys so much.",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,False,,,True,t3_17ffqt,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/17ffqt/my_insurance_required_preauthorization_for_mental/,

tl;dr - Parents don't believe in ADHD and other psychiatric deficiencies like it even though there's evidence everywhere that it is in fact real, and I believe myself to suffer from a majority of known symptoms. My parents won't even let me talk to a doctor to get checked for it. I have no money as I am a broke college student, and all of the money I make from work goes to pay for school. I need help phrasing arguments to convince my parents of why I should at least get checked out, but if you really intend to help me you'll probably need to read the entire post to understand. I'm sure many have you have been in or are in the same shoes i was in/still am in.

So here's my story:

When I was much younger, I was diagnosed with Test Anxiety. My parent's didn't buy it as they don't buy into a lot of psychiatric science(although it never stopped them from sending me to anger management). I've always had trouble staying focused on any task that I had to do. If something gave me enjoyment, I was able to focus more on it, but even then I was still prone to distraction. My parents wrote it off as me just being young.

When I sit down, I can never sit still. I started playing the drums in an attempt to give myself something to do, so now instead of just bouncing out of my seat, I play various organized drum beats. Still can't sit still. 

I can never focus on a task that NEEDS to be done, no matter how much necessity I mentally place on the task, and no matter what the repercussions will be for failing to complete the task.

When I was in middle and elementary school, I was picked on for spazzing and generally didn't have any friends, so I took to reading books. I would read for hours, although I would read through a paragraph and realize that I wasn't paying attention the first time through and have to read it three or four times to get the gist of what it said. I still have to do that. My parents use the fact that I can read for hours on end as an argument against me having ADHD, even though I've explained how I'm still easily distracted while I'm reading.

Throughout school, all the way from elementary to the present, my work has suffered from lack of concentration. No matter how badly I needed to focus, I just couldn't(and still cannot) bring myself to do it. The same goes for work around the house, like cleaning my room or taking the trash out or putting away the dishes. No matter what ultimatum my parents(mostly my father) gave/gives me, I couldn't/can't bring myself to focus.

Now I'm in my first semester of college. I've basically screwed myself as far as classes go, due to my general lack of concentration. I've done a lot of research on ADHD and I fit the bill way more than I'd like, and leaving it alone is really hurting my life.

A lot of my friends have been taking adderall to help them with studying for tests and writing papers(illegal, blah blah I know) so I decided to finally follow suit and try it myself. Unfortunately, everyone I know who could possibly sell me some is out. One of my friends did have some Vyvance though, which I researched and found out is the drug that will replace adderall once it's patent is up(a lot of you probably already knew this, but I'm just trying to verify that I have done my research). I purchased the Vyvance from her, and I took it at around 10:00 AM Eastern Time today here in the U.S. My friends told me that when they take adderall that they are so keyed in on the work they are doing that they literally cannot look away from it. 

It kicked in at around 10:30 Eastern Time. What I've noticed so far with Vyvance isn't that I'm not in control, in fact it's quite the opposite. All feelings of helplessness have left me, and I can finally focus. I've checked all of the side effects and found that the only ones I'm experiencing(so far) are dry mouth, a mildly accelerated heart rate(really only when something evokes a very emotional response, I'm still at a normal heart rate when I'm doing something menial like taking out the trash or watching tv), and less of an appetite. I feel like I can perform to the best of my abilities like never before and that the world is mine to conquer.

I have no history of addiction to anything, and I have been prescribed hydrocodone and Oxycontin, as well as having consumed alcohol and marijuana without developing a habitual use of any of these. I haven't had a drink in two years, and I smoke maybe once or twice a month.

As I am a brokeass college student still stuck on my parents health insurance and working just to pay for school, I have no money to see a doctor or pay for a prescription on my own.

So here it is: How can I convince my parents to let me go get tested to truly see whether or not I have ADHD and get a prescription for Vyvanse or a similar drug? I need help with arguments as to how it would better my quality of life. I'm tired of disappointing my family and friends by not being able to follow through on anything I'm supposed to do, and I'm tired of disappointing myself by not being able to maintain focus on anything of importance to me or anyone else. Please help.

Also: Anyone here who takes Vyvanse as a prescription, I'd like some feedback on it and how it compares to Adderall and other similar drugs(if there are any that really relate to these two). And I'm big on weightlifting and exercising, so I'd like to know how it affects those of you who are like me in that regard. I'd definitely be willing to cut back on certain rigorous activities if it meant that I could finally focus and get my life straight.

Edit: And if anyone has any questions to ask whose answers may help my cause, feel free to ask as I'd be more than willing to add any information that could help.

Another Edit: For anyone who is wondering why I made a throwaway for this post, I know a lot of redditors IRL and there are several of them who I'd like not to know that I smoke weed every now and again. I've subscribed to this subreddit with my real account as well, and I will definitely frequent in the future for help.

Hopefully the last Edit: Taking the Vyvance was a mistake. I did not take it in an attempt to self medicate. I mentioned that a lot of my friends take meds like adderall and vyvance  in order to help them study or write papers and such. The original reason I purchased it was to help write a paper that is due tomorrow that I had fallen behind on. But today I have talked to my professor about several of the problems that I had been having and he gave me an extension on the date I had to turn the paper in. He's an excellent professor and one of the people here I can relate to the most, and we've developed a decent student-teacher bond which really means that I should have done this in the first place instead of attempting to use a drug to help. The reason I included the part about the drugs was to be completely honest with everyone here so that I can get as much help as possible. I phrased it incorrectly further up in the post:

&gt;How can I convince my parents to let me go get tested to truly see whether or not I have ADHD and get a prescription for Vyvanse or a similar drug?

It should have read:

&gt;How can I convince my parents to let me go get tested to truly see whether or not I have ADHD and get a professional opinion on my condition and what I should do, be it medication, therapy or even a simple routine change?

Some of the things he does to cope include having hyper focus when he is working out a problem, and listening to every word that is said to him so he can understand others clearly. This has helped me, as his girlfriend, to speak more clearly and say what I mean the first time, but I am still working on it..probably a girl thing. When there are many things to be done, it can still be pretty overwhelming for him get started and a program we watched once said when he feels like this he should start with a very small task or corner to clean and then he'll start feeling better.

Curious to know if people have had experience with Retarded Ejaculation, likely in relation to ADHD. From my understanding this is likely due to low levels of dopamine in the system (whether the fault of dopamine production or the transmitters). I currently take Adderall IR 10mg, but that has been known to know to cause retarded ejaculation.


I've looked into otc supplements that increase dopamine levels (L-Dopa; L-Tyrosine), but it seems that the main problem with people with ADHD is within the transmitters, not on the production end.

I tried to look it up, but I only had vague ideas for what the search should say.

Apparently, I have ADD. It was discovered accidentally when I was in counseling. I guess it has masked itself for years as depression and anxiety. Suddenly, the fact that I often would lay down and stare at the ceiling because I couldn't think of anything more appealing, the fact that I have trouble making myself go to classes, that work is often a painful experience that involves me needing to make frequent trips to the bathroom to cry, and the fact that I have often ignored my daughter because I could not make myself pay attention to her made sense. I couldn't believe it took this long to figure out, but my doctor suggested that I was probably smart enough to just coast by in high school and that it wasn't until college that my crappy study habits (I was supposed to have study habits?) became a problem. I just figured I was really lazy and anxious, and if I could just force myself to try harder, I would be ok--I just needed to figure out how other people were able to force themselves. 

I've been on vyvanse for a month now and honestly, it's changed my life so much. I'm more patient with my daughter, since I'm able to pay attention long enough to understand her needs and nurture them, and I'm able to get through work without having an internal tantrum. Still, I was diagnosed after Spring finals. I feel like the real test will be when I go back in the fall. 

I'm terrified. I'm worried that everything will be the same and that it will turn out that I'm really not cut out to have a degree and everything I've hoped for really is out of reach. I don't know if the medication will help or not, and I have no idea what other kind of techniques I should try. I was hoping maybe some of you could give me some practical advice, because at twenty six, I feel like a huge failure to still be working on something that I should have had when I was twenty two, and I feel worse that my record is less than stellar and I'm on my fourth major.

Man I wish I had that... you guys are so hyper and fun and creative!"". Okay, sure that is sorta cool. Except that the hyperactivity can't really be turned off, it makes me seem annoying to people. I'm a huge attention seeker, which isn't neccesarily my fault, but I have to control it (which sucks). I'm creative because I can tell long elaborate stories if you just give me a word to base it around, I LOVE writing. Stories, notes, descriptions, etc. I'm also a great reader, I think words are something that I hyperfocus on (never used that word, iffy on what it means, sorry if I used it wrong). But still, you can do these things and not be ADHD/ADD. It makes me do terrible in school (I pray for C's.) and I just despise chores. I would definitely rather sit in a room and stare at a wall for hours than do my chores, which my dad just can't understand. My friends get pissed at me because I forget what they said right after they said it, and I interrupt a lot.

Once we reached the summit, we found ourselves in a place which was almost deathly quiet. It was such a relaxing place that somebody suggested we just sit here for a few minutes not talking to each other. Everybody went off to sit on some rock and I could see how they all lost themselves in their surroundings. Meanwhile, I was sitting on my own desperately trying to just shut up my constant stream of thoughts for a few seconds and feel how they were feeling right now. I wasn't even panicking; this is just the norm for me. I've recently realized that I cant stand silence. I'm always trying to drown out my thoughts by having a fan running on max 2 feet away from my desk pointing at a wall. I need a constant stream of external stimuli to have part of my mind focus on while I try and do something else.

Does anybody else find themselves thinking a couple of thoughts at the same time? Is anybody else always battling themselves for control over what they should focus on? I have felt this way for so long that I've learned to deal with it and can function like any normal person in day to day life. However, sometimes I just try to silence my mind  but find that I can never manage it for more than a few seconds.

Trying to separate biological factors from how I was raised.",bohowannabe,30,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1jrzos/in_order_to_get_things_accomplished_i_need_to/,"* I have a problem, where I feel the need to tell myself that bad things are going to happen, in order to get things accomplished that are imperative in my life. I'm the first one to go to college in my family, and in order for me to complete my college coursework, I kept telling myself that horrible things would happen if I didn't start or complete an assignment on time. I felt that if I did not keep hampering these negative thoughts into my head that I would end up procrastinating, instead of finishing the assignments. I genuinely have a procrastination problem, because I have an anxiety problem. Also, to be fair, my fears were legit, because if I didn't finish college, my prospects for the future were very limited, as I come from a working class family.

* I jump between being overly anxious and worried, to being addicted to things that I enjoy, in order to escape my anxiety and self soothe myself. I've had bad OCD in the past, where I would perform rituals, like praying for two to three hours before bed (because if I didn't pray then people in my life who I loved would die). My symptoms of OCD appeared at a very young age. I remember being around four, five, or six, and walking around with my tongue sticking out all the time. I began doing this, after my mother told me a story about a girl who had a condition where she could swallow her tongue. In retrospect, I realize now that the child probably had seizures, and that my mother (who used to work at daycare, I believe as a side job) had to prevent her from swallowing her tongue.

* I think ADD or ADHD runs in my family, which I suspect conflates my problems. My mother is very impulsive, and often so immature that she acts more like a child than my mother. She is also a hoarder, which I know is a symptom of OCD. Her behavior contrasts strongly with my father who tries to have a no bullshit attitude, and who tells my brother and I that we either aren't working hard enough, or the right way, all the time. I know that he means well, and that he is at least more emotionally and intellectually aware of his behavior than my mother. Regardless, this contrast between parenting styles created a lot of anxiety in my life, and in the life of my brother. I think it's important to note, however, that my OCD symptoms appeared before my mother met my father and we moved in with him. Both of my parents genuinely seem to have problems with communicating with their children, and both my brother and I have problems with perfectionism.

* I've been trying to understand for a while now, if my problems with anxiety, procrastination, perfectionism, and negative thoughts are a result of my upbringing, a lack of social experience (I can be social when I want to, I'm just uncomfortable from being a sensitive person), or from biological reasons.

* How do you even begin to understand which factors are causing which problems, in order to find some solutions, and heal?

tl;dr How can you tell if biological reasons (ADD &amp; OCD) are what are creating problems in your life, or if it is just a result of how you were raised?

Anyway. What are some things I can do to keep my time from funneling away during transitions?

This is especially a problem because it means I'm essentially skipping breakfast EVERY day. Mostly, I lose focus when I HAVE to stop for a second. Like, if I'm about to take a shower, but my dad needs the bathroom, by the time he's out I've gotten sucked into Facebook, or a daydream.

There are a lot of uninformed people out there.  It's hard enough dealing with people in RL who say they don't think ADHD is real.   
Yet it's much more annoying when I see a productivity blog with ""cure ADHD"" entries, and then there's people with anecdotal claims that they cured their own or their child's ADHD.  
  
That kind of uninformed prattle trivialises ADHD, its effects and ADHDers as well as simply spreading misinformation.

Admittedly, it's tough dealing with RL people.  It's hard to convince people who have their minds set and sometimes you can't just tell someone he's an idiot to his face.  However, we can take advantage of the anonymity the internet affords us and we can help stem the spread of disinformation or get in the way of people with anti-ADHD agendas.

ADHD is a disorder that can seriously interfere with learning, social skills, academic/professional success and our quality of life.  Although we may not want to admit it, it can be debilitating even for the people who have the easiest time managing it


**What I'm asking of you:**  


Every time you see a bad ADHD article respond to it in the comments section if the site has one.  If you can't do it yourself, and even if you could and did, link to the article here and let us know about it so we can go and comment.

Comment to correct the publisher/author and to inform other readers who may read your comment.  

* Correct their mistakes as politely as possible.
* Admonish them for trivialising ADHD
* If you have the time and links, direct them to correct information.
* Whenever someone says they ""cured"" their ADHD by changing their diet or some such, point out that they've simply proven they were misdiagnosed.  ADHD currently has no ""cure.""
* If they appear to be publishing to sensationalise while publishing misinformation, tell them they're being irresponsible and offensive.  
* If they seem to have an ADHD agenda and you can point out a pattern on their behalf, please do so.
* Find some way to insert in your comment that the writer clearly isn't a professional or relevant authority on the subject.


The diagnosis for ADHD comes straight out of the DSM.  In general, there's so much confidence in the DSM that you rarely hear about people claiming that other disorders aren't real. Why should this one not be?  
Psychiatric *disorders* are sometimes preventable and they are, to some degrees, manageable.  They aren't generally curable.


Currently, research indicates that ADHD is:  
* genetic/heritable  
* related to the actual development of the brain

I hated it because it made me feel depressed. But, until recently, I ignored my ADHD because my parents didn't believe in humoring my ""disability"" as an ""excuse"" for unproductive habits. (Come to find out, getting up on time, procrastinating, and many other things that frustrated me to the point of physical distress or  anger could be easily explained and helped by acknowledging my condition. I mean seriously, who told my parents that ignoring a problem is the best way to handle it.)

Anyway, once I started looking into it (most significantly after I found /r/ADHD) I decided I should try different medication. After switching I felt noticeably better.  I didn't dip into depression anymore, and I could focus and eat better.  I didn't pay much attention to it though. Why would I, things were going well.  Recently, however, I was running low on adderall because my parents have to mail i to me at college yada yada. I took one of my surplus concerta. (don't lie, you all have some. Its never perfectly 30 days. I have a whole damn pharmacy of lower doses from when i changed my prescription.)  Anyway, i felt like absolute shit. I ate 1 meal, and was depressed as hell the whole day, until it wore off.

At that moment, I realized that I had just made possibly the best decision of my life to date. I had always been really bitchy because I was depressed throughout high school. I never told anyone about it, because I had the same ""just get over your problems"" attitude about depression that my parents had about ADD. Now that I had changed it, I wouldn't feel like shit anymore. I would have to pull myself out of depression every other month. I wouldn't have to fake happiness around my friends. I wouldn't have to force myself to eat. I would have to sacrifice my mental, social and physical well being for the ability to focus in school.

1368423855.0,25,self.ADHD,1e8adv,Coping Harder for High IQ ADHDers?,tarrou123,37,12,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1e8adv/coping_harder_for_high_iq_adhders/,"Do you all think that having a high IQ makes copying with ADHD easier or harder? 

Now, I'm NOT referring to academic performance. I think that having a higher-thank-average IQ is advantageous in that department, since our intellectual capabilities can compensate (to a certain degree) for our deficiencies in executive functions. For instance, if you wait until the last minute to study for a test, being intelligent and a quick learner will only serve you well.


To illustrate what I'm referring to, I'm pasting this quote from the Wikipedia article on self-actualization:

""Research shows that when people live lives that are different from their true nature and capabilities, they are less likely to be happy than those whose goals and lives match.""

 In other words, the closer our real self (who we are) is to our ideal self (who we would like to be) the happier we are. 


I have been thinking about this lately, since I have a couple of friends/co-workers who most likely have ADHD (not diagnosed formally), but they're not on the high IQ end of the bell curve. One of these individuals is a close friend of mine. 

Some times I wonder if it's easier for them to be happier because of this. For instance, my friend is a very nice person and average in intelligence. Her lack of focus (she exhibits mainly PI traits) has certainly crippled her in certain areas, but she's upbeat most of the time. She's also not very self-reflexive.


I, on the other hand, have an IQ of of 130 something, yet we work in the same department. When I take a physics class, I understand pretty much everything. The same thing happens with most disciplines. My professors usually give me props for my analysis and insight; yet, my GPA is getting lower and lower.

I have many talents, I understand many different disciplines, but I lack the motivation and skills to truly deepen my knowledge and reach my goals. Everything that I'm interested in requires a PhD, and I can't even finish my BA.


It's like I was telling another friend of mine, I don't have the physical attributes to become a pro basketball player, but it's alright because I never even considered it, nobody ever suggested it. 

But when it comes to intellectual endeavors, I'm always interested in them. People always tell me that I'm smart and I would do well and it always feels like I possess 90% of what it takes, and that only10% I'm missing. And that 10% I now call ADHD, and it renders everything else mostly useless, because I will never live up to the hype.


Add to all that, the fact that non-ADHDers with higher IQ's already have a hard time socializing and you can end up pretty lonely and dissatisfied with your life. 

I can see how both things affect me socially: my ADHD makes it hard to have interest in relationships, find time to spend with friends, etc and the difference in interest with most of the people that I'm surrounded by makes it almost impossible to make friends with them.

The same thing happened to my mom. She used to devour books when younger and dreamed of being a writer/journalist, but ended up doing clerical work most of her life. Now that I have seen some of her comments on different websites and other personal things she's written, I can definitely see that she really had a talent for it, but unfortunately, she tells me that she barely graduate from college at the age of 33.

Barkley's](http://russellbarkley.org), [Taking Charge of Adult ADHD](http://www.guilford.com/cgi-bin/cartscript.cgi?page=pr/barkley18.htm&amp;dir=trade/psychology). I summarized all the main points and strategies from Step Four of the book for myself and put them around my house. It has really helped me with my daily ADHD struggle (thank you, thank you, thank you, Dr. Barkley!!!). So, I thought I would share with my fellow reADHDitors, a summarized list of Dr. Barkley's, ""Everyday Rules for Success"". I truly hope it helps you too!

*FYI- it was stressed very frequently in the book to get diagnosed, and get medication - these rules were designed to augment your treatment of effective medication; basically fill in the cracks that your medication cannot. However, I feel like they will still be helpful (maybe not as much) even if you are not medicated.*

------------------------------------------------------------------

**CHANGE YOUR LIFE**

***Everyday Rules for Success***

---

**Rule 1: Stop the Action!**

*Buy time before you respond.*

•	Perform a simple action to stave off the urge to act.

---

**Rule 2: See the Past . . . and Then the Future**

*See what’s coming.*

•	Use tangible visual aids to give your mind’s eye extra help – one that represents the “don’t” and one that represents the “do.”

---

**Rule 3: Say the Past . . . and Then the Future**

*Analyze before deciding; develop rules for the future.*

•	Narrate what’s happening out loud – where you are, what you’re doing, what you could do next, and what might happen.

•	While at a task, give yourself instructions about keeping at it, doing it carefully, completing each step, and finishing the project.

---

**Rule 4: Externalize Key Information**

*Rely on something besides your memory.*

•	Put physical cues in plain view in problem situations (e.g., signs, post-it notes, etc).

•	Make a list of steps or procedures you want to follow the next time you encounter a problem task.

•	Carry a journal with you all the time to write things down instead of rely on your memory.

---

**Rule 5: Feel the Future**

*Stay motivated.*

•	Ask yourself, “*What will it feel like when I get this done?*”

---

**Rule 6: Break It Down . . . and Make It Matter**

*Bring the future a lot closer.*

•	Break down longer-term tasks or goals into much, much smaller units or work quotas. After each quota, 1) congratulate self, 2) take a short break [a few minutes], 3) tell someone what you’ve gotten done, and 4) give yourself a small and brief reward. 

•	Make yourself accountable to someone. Reward them for their help.

•	Give yourself little rewards as you accomplish each small objective.

---

**Rule 7: Make Problems External, Physical, and Manual**

*Simplify problem solving.*

•	Use physical, external tools to solve problems whenever you can.

---

**Rule 8: Have a Sense of Humor!**

*Accept your imperfections and get on with your life.*

I am a 32F returning to school to get my undergrad.  I found a great psychologist and had my first of many appointments last month.  I did self reports, interviews etc.... and by the end of those sessions she said she was confident that I had ADHD-PI which was no surprise to me.  But, as part of their diagnostic procedure, I had some psychological testing as well.  Last week I went in for results and I got a bomb dropped on me.  While they believe that I have ADHD-PI, they also discovered a very severe impairment in my cognitive processing speed.  


So Reddit, I also have a learning disability that I have most likely struggled with since birth that no one caught.  From initial testing, it's considered severe although I will spend the next few weeks getting additional tests.  Interestingly enough, it mimics many/if not all of the same symptoms of ADHD-PI or ADHD-C.  I am incredibly well spoken, highly intelligent, held high level jobs but I couldn't focus amongst a myriad of other symptoms all covered under the ADHD-PI diagnosis.

I felt it was starting to affect my job to a point where if something wasn't done, I may no longer have a job.  I work as a Systems Administrator and deal with highly technical projects and problems which require particular attention to detail.  Up til this point in my career, I've always had my own office in a quiet setting where I could work things out.  A job change a few months ago put me into a workplace where I am surrounded by others working and having conversations on the phone all day long.  As an example, I would be trying to read a document and about 3 sentences in I would be listening to someone elses conversation even though my eyes were still ""reading"" the words. I would get little to no work done at all.  I asked if I could be put in a separate room and my request was declined.  I found myself starting to work late at night at home after my kids went to bed.  Its been a vicious cycle of sleep deprivation and poor performance at work.  

As I previously said, I've had it my whole life.  I have most of the classic signs and symptoms but they were manageable to a point (save for a lot of the social symptoms) where I could do my job adequately and live life.

I've had ADHD all my life and it hasn't really affected my life much until I finished high school and moved on to real life. I was easily able to get straight A's in school without studying and I didn't need to hold a job. 

Fast forward a few years and I'm going into my fifth year in university for engineering. Luckily for me I've always done exceptionally well in maths and physics so I didn't fail out. However, no matter how good you are in these subjects you will still not get great results without studying or doing homework. I ended up on probation twice, finally decided to accept the fact that I had ADHD, went to the doctor, got concerta, got things under control and now I'm doing pretty well. 

Now what I wanted to talk about here is work. Between every university years I had to get jobs and keeping them was often very difficult. Most of them I ended up quitting without giving my 2 weeks notice after 2-3 months because for some reason I just couldn't handle doing repetitive work for more than a few months. 

What I wanted to ask from others with ADHD is how do you guys actually feel like when trying to hold a job that you cannot stand doing? Right now I'm painting houses for the summer. Been doing it for 2 months and I'm having a lot of trouble holding the job (Stopped taking concerta after the semester but planning on starting it again tomorrow to try and keep my job). I have a lot of trouble explaining how I feel myself when I'm put in a position that I don't want to be in. It somewhat feels like I'm losing control. Did you ever watch movies or tv shows where a drug addict doesn't have any drugs and is just pacing around nervously, not making sense and looks like he's just going to lose it? Well that's the closest thing I can come up with as to how I feel inside my mind when at work trying not to quit. It feels like I'm about to freak out throughout my shift, like I just have no clue what to do with myself and that I'm losing my sanity. Weird way of explaining it but can anyone else share their work stories and how it made them feel? I'm just wondering if I'm alone in feeling this way or if there are others out there like this too. Thanks in advance!

adhd really has no plus sides for me.

I just wanted to make this quick post to say how great everyone in this community is and it's awesome we have recently hit 2,000 subscribers.

Also to remind everyone of a few things.

#####Upvoting posts
***
 We seem to have a disconnect around here with participating via comments and participating with upvotes. If you are taking the time to comment on a post upvote it, unless the reason you are commenting is to tell them why it shouldn't be posted. If a post is worth you making discussion on the best way for people to see it and be added to the discussion is with upvotes and we have a real lack of people participating via the upvote. Also the downvote is not for opinions you disagree with.

#####Read the FAQ
***
If you're new or even old and have yet to read the FAQ please go do so, it is there for a reason and we still need to improve it over time. The only way for us as a community to produce the best FAQ/Help page we can is for people within the community to actually read it. 

#####IRC
***
On the side bar there is a link to the [IRC chat room](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/ADHD). It is a great place to hang out and talk with other community members. There are also weekly meetups, times are posted on the sidebar.

#####Attitude
***
This is very important for any online forum. You can not figure a person out nor know their intent via a post over the internet so please be nice and respectful especially to those attempting to bring content into the community. If someone has posted an article it means they found it interesting or simply that we might like to discuss it. It does NOT mean the person posting agrees with the opinion of the article, if you disagree with the article but are still willing to post and discuss it then UPVOTE the post. This is what upvotes and downvotes are for, filtering out irrelevant content not to show your support or disagreement so please keep that in mind so we can continue to make this a great community with healthy discussion.

#####Formatting
***
Formatting when posting a wall of text is extremely vital around here. You have to remember most around here have ADHD :p Reading a large wall of text with out any formatting to indicate main points or break up thoughts and sections is difficult and many will simply look at it and move on without reading. As you can see this post is formatted in a way that I find easy to read so hopefully so do others. Remember to think about formatting for long wordy comments as well. 

**Formatting is very easy**: 

[Here is the formatting help page](http://www.reddit.com/help/commenting)

* For the main sections I used h5 which is a header style. All you have to do is put two or more '#' at the beginning of a new line before the text you want as your header, there is h2-h6. The numbers indicating the amount of '#' needed. 

* The horizontal lines are done by using at least three asterisks '*' on a new line.

* Bullets are listed above the comment section. It is done by going down to a new line and starting it with '*' followed by ' ' (a blank space) then your bullet text.

##Thanks for everyone's time, let's continue to grow our community.

1331157109.0,25,self.ADHD,qmblz,Hesitation and ADHD.,,31,6,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/qmblz/hesitation_and_adhd/,"I just had a bit of a revelation today, and I wondered if anyone had similar stories to share.

As I get older (I'm 19), I find that my ability to do anything other than browse the internet decreases. It has become a really big problem, with school, chores, finding a job, etc. I can't *start* anything. I thought it was ADHD, but I realized today that it's an *effect* of ADHD.

I was cleaning up after the cats, a good 20-minute task, which I do every day without hesitation. I was wondering to myself how it was I could do this but neglect to clean my absolute trainwreck of a room after long, painful months of trying. I realized it was because I *need* to clean up after the cats, and I don't allow myself to hesitate.

My theory is, over the years I've learned to restrain myself. I don't speak when I want to, I don't do things when I want to. I've got this hesitation/slowness filter over everything, because otherwise I can't function without being all over the place. But now it keeps me from doing *anything*. I'm not a funny person anymore because I make myself slow down to think about that quip I was about to throw into the conversation, saying it belatedly. Instead of just jumping into cleaning, I would stop and think and plan. Because planning was something I was never good at. It's why my ADHD dad is poor and unsuccessful. It allows me to work out which parts of the thing I'm about to undertake are essential.

Except I overdid it. Now I plan and plan and plan and never do anything. Because doubts creep into my mind. Depression and hopelessness take over, because I've conditioned myself to accept failure.

I'm now taking a break from cleaning my room, which I managed to start after realizing that all I had to do was make it a *need* instead of a possibility in my mind. I jumped into it, I'm doing things in the order they occur to me, and I'm getting it done. Planning doesn't work for me, because I can't do things in a preset order. It's good that I did plan a while ago, because now I'm not going to, say, attempt to organize my bookshelf before I've even gotten all of my books off the floor. I could have easily done something like that. I have those kinds of essential things in the back of my mind because I did plan ahead, but now I'm allowing myself to do what I want. I'm following my whims. And for the first time in a long time, I don't feel useless. What I'm realizing is that I am useless if I try to follow a rule book; I can only move forward if I do it in my own style. And I think it's important that every ADHDer know that about themselves.

**TL;DR. I learned that you need to plan ahead, but when it comes to it, follow your whims while keeping the bare minimum of essential tasks in the back of your mind. You must follow your wants and not hesitate in order to move forward at all.**

Hopefully others can relate. Anyone else ever had this problem with hesitation or a similar revelation about their ADHD?

EDIT: Also, I think that when I ignore my wishes, they sit in the forefront of my mind bothering me and distracting me from whatever I was trying to force myself to do. Just a thought I wanted to add. I hope the ADHD community doesn't take this whole thing as self-serving, I just felt it was an extremely important revelation and was hoping it might help someone else too.",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,True,,,True,t3_qmblz,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/qmblz/hesitation_and_adhd/,

1376076277.0,23,self.ADHD,1k1m4c,"School is go SO well. I just need to brag a little. Plus, I have some advice.",lacelacelace,32,9,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1k1m4c/school_is_go_so_well_i_just_need_to_brag_a_little/,"I began taking 20 mg Adderall in February when I was diagnosed with ADHD-C. I had initially expected it to give me this huge urge to study, but it didn't. I still felt normal. The difference was that everything became manageable. I wouldn't stare at a blank page and cry. I'd have ideas that I could write down and eventually organize into concise statements. Adderall gave me the concentration I needed to be able to go over tests multiple times before submitting them. Last semester, I got all As and one B. 


Yesterday, I just finished the Summer semester in which I took a very difficult math class. Today, I checked my scores. I got ONE HUNDRED PERCENT on my FINAL. And 100% in the class. That makes me feel so happy. I worked on the final for 3 hours. It obviously paid off beautifully. 


**So I have some tips I've learned:** 


* **Sit at the front of the class.** You don't have to be 100% active in the class. It's just a fact that the best students sit toward the front. Plus, you'll always hear everything the teacher is saying. 


* **If something confuses you, write it down.** Throughout class, if something doesn't make sense, I'll write it down on a paper in the question format. That way I can ask the professor to clarify after class or I can look it up on my own time. Clear things up as they confuse you. 


* **Don't let things slip by.** The key to thoroughly understanding something is *working* toward understanding it. In a math class, for instance, if one formula makes no sense, go over it silently over and over until it does. In a fast course, you'll be lost in a matter of minutes if you didn't understand the last topic. 


* **Only write down the essentials.** We've all experienced this. You try to be a good student by writing down everything the teacher says or everything that is on the board. Later on, when you look at your notes, there's just way too much. For me, I kept writing down pythagorean identities, when in reality, I didn't need them. Instead, keep a list of things covered, so that when test time comes, you can look it up if you're a little shaky. 


* **Take notes in a way that makes sense to YOU.** Don't be afraid to write things down in a completely different way than your peers. Instead of writing down thousands of formulas for Cos(A+B),(Sin(A-B), all I needed to know was that Cos formulas for adding thetas were the opposite of equation, while Sin formulas were the same. See, that makes no sense, but writing a note like that to myself clarified a big confusion of mine. 


* **Keep busy if you get bored.** This drove my professor nuts, but in class I would knit or crochet during down time. Since I only needed to write down essentials, while we were going over homework or the lesson presentation, I would space out. To remedy this, I kept my hands busy and my ears attentive. I WILL say, however, you shouldn't do this until you understand how the course will be for you. You might find that you need to write a lot down. Also, it would be polite to speak to your professors and explain that it helps you concentrate. They'll understand once they get your scores. 


* **Be practical and keep routines.** Every day before a test, I would spend several hours going over all the covered material. And do the same thing the morning of the test. Always make sure that you are more prepared than you need to be. Don't simmer in overconfidence. Most importantly, go over your work over and over again. Just because you're confident in your answer doesn't mean it's correct. For math tests, I use graph paper as scratch paper and do all of the equations on there first. Then I do the equations on the test. I compare my work and if something doesn't look right, I'll do it again until it's perfect. I also make note of which equations I am confused by and make a point of going back to it every few equations. Another tip for math tests: Try starting at the back of the back. Most of the time, the more difficult equations are there. If you know them, brilliant! If you don't you can happily skip them and go back later. 


* **Take advantage of programs.** Look into your school's program for disabled students. If you get in, you'll get extra time for tests and will get to be alone while taking them. It is so much better than getting anxious seeing everyone leaving during a test. There are no worries. 


Anyway, these are the conclusions I've come to. I hope they help a little! School is tough, so just keep trying, work hard, and go easy on yourself! ",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,False,,ORANGE,True,t3_1k1m4c,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1k1m4c/school_is_go_so_well_i_just_need_to_brag_a_little/,

When my wife and I moved into our first house I found that I had a great passion for wood work. I would watch shows at nauseum when I was unemployed and build things in the garage as often as I could. What I quickly found was that my motivation to build something would quickly wane about half way through and I would find myself cutting corners to just ""be done"" with my project. It showed in the things I built.

I looked at a dresser that I built about 4 years ago, it looked nice. except there was a gap on the top where a rail met a stile. instead of replacing the rail, I decided to just fill it with wood putty. Now that wood putty has shrunken and the gap is clearly visible. I also noticed that the drawers I built were constructed as if I were going to be storing bowling balls in them. the walls were made of 3/4 inch thick MDF. Why the hell would I choose to use MDF? Well, if I used 1/4"" ply then I would have had to glue up the pieces instead of just nailing them. That would have taken too long. 

On the other hand, after my diagnosis and treatment, I have found that I can start a project and complete it without losing that motivation to make quality work. Recently, I built a coffee table for my living room. It was a big project, I bought the wood rough sawn so I had to square it up and plane each piece to a perfect fit. Something that took me almost 2 weeks alone to do. I was dead set that my table would contain no metal fasteners. Everything would be glued properly as it should. This usually involves advance joinery that is time consuming and tedious. when I finished it I was pretty proud of myself. I accomplished exactly what I wanted to accomplish and the table looks perfect. I show it off to everyone who comes over, I'm able to show them the through mortises and the exposed breadboard tenons because they look perfect. The thing I was most proud of was the finishing. You can make a project look fantastic, but if you cut corners when finishing, it will ruin the entire piece. I spent almost an additional week sanding it over and over to the point where I was wet sanding with 4,000 grit paper. It is almost as smooth as glass. 

Another short note, after my diagnosis I began using more hand tools and less power tools. Now when I have to plane a board I don't run to the jointer, I grab my hand planes and go at it.

It's just a really scary thought. Those of us on meds are basically chained down to whatever area allows us to get those meds. What happens if the meds are suddenly unavailable? What happens if you're forced out of the country? So much depends on being able to be medicated regularly. 

For me, at least, a life without meds is filled with constant regret, disappointment, self-loathing, anxiety, depression (clinical and otherwise), and shame. I just can't see myself doing that.

It's not even like meds prevent all of this, they just minimize it to the point where I can deal with everything.

##### PHENOMENAL EXAMPLES FROM PAST WEEKS: (updated 5/28) **FRESH**

* I graduated college!  Fuck yeah!
* I paid off my credit card.
* FINALLY hung my custom mirror that's been gathering dust in the hallway for about a month.
* Finished some more group projects ahead of schedule so I'm not the one everyone is waiting on.
* Today I realized I was the common denominator in many bad relationships that are most important to me. I told my loved ones this and started a new chapter today. Feels good.
* So far, I've managed to make $90 doing different repair work. This is a pretty big deal for me, my ADHD is bad enough that I'm on disability
* I had my highest GPA ever with my most difficult courses ever
* Got my blood work done, got stuff needed for other medical testing, and I set up an appointment with a woman's counselor to add to the therapy I am already doing
* I'm late but I finally stopped talking about auditioning for a play at my local theater and did it! 
* I got engaged. :)
* I think I have finally identified a definable improvement of my meds.
* Many many more!

At 31 and with lots of problems in life I finally decided to start taking some steps to try to fix it.  I did the books, support from an awesome GF, etc.  Helped but not perfect.  I wanted to try medication again.
Sucks though is I'm kinda broke due to my own ADHD related fuck ups.  So I get in at a low cost clinic I can afford.  Make an appointment which kinda took a lot for me to do.   I was kinda scared/nervous about it all.  Well I show up and find out that its only an intake appointment and I'll have to make another appointment to see the doc, sucks but okay I can deal with this.  Then I find out it'll be almost 6 weeks.  Really sucks but at least I'm on track right?  They called today 4 hours before my appointment to tell me they can't see me and want me to setup an appointment for a psych evaluation.  This really sucks I was finally going to get help, so I call the place they referred me to.  They aren't even taking appointments, just names and they'll call back as soon as they have an opening.  I feel so much rage right now.  
1. Why couldn't they have called any time in the last -6 weeks- and told me about this?
2. Why refer me to a clinic that isn't even taking appointments yet?  That just seems like bullshit cock tease.  
3. This seems like a terrible thing to do for people seeking metal health treatment, just kinda jerk them around?  I'm sure if I was some kinda teeth grinding raging maniac they'd help me but since I'm just a nice quite tripped out guy I get bullshit.  

Sorry just had to rage.  Anyone else had or having similar problems?  Let me know.

1365525671.0,24,self.ADHD,1bzy4e,To all those who believe that ADHD and learning disabilities aren’t real….,jsista,29,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1bzy4e/to_all_those_who_believe_that_adhd_and_learning/,"I’d love for you to spend one day in my shoes. I guarantee you, your mind will change. 

If you can, just try and imagine your brain trolling you all day every day, and even when you take specific measures to put it at ease, it just trolls you even worse. ADHD is real, if it wasn't I wouldn't be fuming right now. 
	
I've had attention and learning problems my whole life but I really don’t consider it a big deal. I know what I’m good at and I build upon that. Evidence is I’m doing a Masters in one of the top schools in Canada. If I couldn't handle it, I wouldn't have gotten this far. What does irritate the hell out of me is when I’m good at certain things, my troll brain likes to take it away and completely screw up my performance. Specifically, I’m talking about statistics. 

I love statistics. I’m good at it, I understand the concepts and it just makes sense. I know that I have attention problems, so when I write my exams I sit at a separate table in the corner of the class so I have absolutely no distractions. Sometimes, I even bring earplugs to the exam just to block out the noise of people’s pencils scratching, coughing, chair squeaking, questions being asked, etc. You’d think that an exam room is quiet. Next time, sit in one and just listen to all the noise around you. Imagine if you couldn’t tune that out, you’d go insane. I also bring a coffee (I've never been medicated and I can’t function without caffeine) and a snack. I essentially give myself the perfect surrounding so I can’t see my friends finish before me and become anxious because I’m still writing. I create my own bubble. You’d think this was enough. Unfortunately it never is. The one thing I can’t block out is my troll brain. 

Imagine writing down the problem on a sheet of paper, double checking to make sure that you've written all the correct values down to the third decimal point. You work on this problem for over half an hour and when you get the final result, it is nowhere to be found in the answer choices. Time to go back and check everything you did to find that one mistake that messed up everything. Ok fine that’s normal. Found the mistake- great. Now restart the whole process again because that one mistake changes everything. Ok another 20 minutes later, you get your result. Again the answer you get is not one of the choices. This time you go back and can’t find where you made the mistake. You go and redo all the calculations to find that you wrote the number you got from your calculator wrong. That also changes all the calculations you have done thus far. Time to go back and redo the question a third time. Finally you get the answer, only it took you an hour to a problem worth 4 points out of 40 that really should have been done in 20 minutes. 

Moving on to the next question, you read the question, underline key words and write down on scrap paper all the important details of the question. You calculate the answer and find your answer in the choices but it doesn't seem right. You spend another 10 minutes looking at it only to realize that when you read the question, you replaced the word “and” and “with” which completely changes the meaning to the entire question. Time to restart once again.  Imagine this happening for every single question on an exam with 40 questions. 

So not only can I not read or write things down properly, but while I’m trying to figure out these problems, it’s like there’s multiple conversations going on in my head at the same time. Imagine trying to work but it’s like people are talking and there’s no possible way of making them hush. Of course that noise is just going to interfere with your concentration even more. 

Anyway, I’m just frustrated because I STUDIED. I KNEW AND UNDERSTOOD ALL THE MATERIAL. I got 100%’s on all the assignments! Just when it comes down to sitting in a room, copying down numbers, reading math problems and concentration, that’s when my brain decides to say “nope! Not happening! I’m going to make you suffer. And because you’re diligent and have been trained to check your work, you’re going to suffer even more because you’ll know that you’re wrong!”

Many people think that what I recounted are insignificant problems that “happen to everyone”, but if that’s the case, why do NONE of the people in my class/program have these problems. Why do I have to single myself out just to maybe do a bit better on this exam by sitting in a corner. Why can’t I stop making these dumb mistakes when I’m aware that I’m prone to making them and work to the best of my ability to refrain from making them? Why does 40 questions take me 3 hours when it takes most people an hour and 15 minutes?

ADHD and learning disabilities are real and they affect an enormous amount of people. However, despite how grueling this process sounds, it’s important to never give up. I never do and it serves me well. It makes me frustrated as all hell, but at the end of it all, I get there too. I just need to exert more effort and have more patience for my annoying troll brain.

TL;DR ADHD is real, its is incredibly annoying when writing exams and even when I do everything to keep it at bay, my brain still trolls me. This is annoying because I'm really good at statistics but it makes the process so painful.

## The main purpose of this thread:

* Provide a place for people to **ask simple questions** which may not need a dedicated post.  
* Give people **new to the  /r/ADHD community (and there are thousands of you)** a chance to say hello and share a bit about their strengths, struggles, and dreams.  
* Reduce the amount of threads asking a simple question in /r/ADHD

***  
**This is the place for questions like:**

* How do I force myself to eat despite a depressed appetite?  
* What was your experience on [medication]?  
* I took Adderall for the first time yesterday, and now I have tentacles growing out of my back!  
* Did you tell your friends, coworkers, family about your ADHD?   
* Do you feel like your ADHD makes you special?  
* How do I talk to [doctor, psych, parents] about getting an ADHD diagnosis?  
* What smells like red?  

**We will attempt to answer every question in this thread (within a week). Hopefully others will help us out...but we won’t leave you hangin'!**

***  
Another method of communicating is to [](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=/r/ADHD).

## The idea is to consolidate all of these kinds of questions into a single place that is more easily searched.  As we migrate from my temporary wiki to the new reddit wiki, these threads will be helpful.

My solution has been to set alarms for everything, preferably multiple alarms in multiple places (timer on stove, phone, etc).

I display most if not all of the typical symptoms. Most of the time, I can cope. I've just learned to accept that it's just the way I am. 

**The only thing that really screws me over is my unyielding inability to concentrate on my schoolwork**. I suffer from depression because of it. No matter how hard I try, it takes me a couple *days* to do what my classmates can accomplish in a few hours. I'm constantly locked up in my room, slaving over assignments for the entire day, only to realize that I've completed about 10% in 7 hours. I don't know where the time goes.

I've been on and off medication since I was young. I currently have a prescription for 10mg of extended release ritalin. I talked to my doctor about how I should use it, we agreed that I might experiment with only taking sparingly, mostly in the evenings after school when I settle down for homework. 

The problem is, I can tell when it kicks in, but not usually in a good way. My heart rate increases slightly, I get jittery sometimes, I get headaches when I start to come down, but I'm a lot more in tune to the things going on around me. I only notice these symptoms when I'm stuck sitting at a desk. In social situations, I feel wonderful and social and I'm actually able to participate in conversation. I feel 'normal.'

**I can only seem to concentrate on things I'm truly interested in.** Which means no matter how hard I try, I just *can't* focus on my schoolwork. It's as if there's a physical barrier in my brain that shuts me off. I've been having such difficulty with it that **I've resorted to taking as many as 3-4 pills over the course of an evening**, even though it doesn't seem to help.

**I don't know what to do.** I've tried everything I can think of to try and cope. Nothing works. What am I doing wrong? Is it the medication? Should I ask about upping my dosage or should I look into switching to something else?

While I'm here I thought I might ask: Based on experience, which type medication do you think might work best for me? I'm interested in hearing the pros and cons and the different effects they give.

No one will remember what I did 100 years from now, so why does it matter?  These are the kinds of things that I think of when I think about ""my life"", and it depresses me, sometimes to tears.

What if I had been diagnosed earlier?,hyperfocusedbeast,28,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1386ve/diagnosed_with_adhd_at_age_33_and_it_has_changed/,"I wish I had discovered this earlier but I had never thought about it in the past.  My background is that I did really well in high school (straight A's/valedictorian) due to my parents strict enforcement of studying and monetary incentives for doing well.  But then I nearly flunked out of college when I was on my own with no one to tell me what to do.  Somehow I managed to graduate with a CS degree and got a crappy job.  Switched to a programming job in finance by sheer luck/timing and struggled there in the beginning the same way I did at the previous job (got reprimanded for tardiness, surfing the web too much, being disruptive, playing online games.)

7 years later I managed to do well somehow despite only really producing real work maybe 25% of the time I was at the office.  I think some of it is due to my uncontrollable need to speak during meetings and sometimes I come up with really good insights.  Now I'm a director and making over $200k just before being diagnosed.

Now that I've been diagnosed and taking adderall and i've read a few books on ADHD I am so much more productive.  I'm a beast at work and producing like I've never been able to before.  I'm not sure it's going to really matter since I've done okay for myself up until now but I definitely enjoy work a lot more.

Personal life has also improved.  A lot less fights with the wife due to me not forgetting to do stuff all the time and also being attentive to the wife's needs.    Started exercising after reading that it helps by joining a Crossfit gym.  I feel a lot better about myself and I'm more confident and in better shape.  I'm sleeping earlier and waking up earlier (6am).  This was impossible for me in the past where I could never make it to class during college even if it started at 10am. 

It's been about two months now since being diagnosed and I'm still really amped up about knowing that this has held me back all these years.  I'm trying to learn as much as I can about it and how to deal with it like making lists and reminders for everything.

I'm wondering however, what if I had been diagnosed with ADHD earlier in life, say during childhood or high school?  Would I have not been as successful because I would have accepted that I have a learning disability?  Has anyone who had been diagnosed earlier in life, done relatively well for themselves because they did find out about it?  Not sure many people can answer this here since it seems like most of the people here are in school or just starting out in their career.

I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until two years ago, so I had 25 years of my adhd contributing to my slightly quirky, but totally awesome personality. I started thinking about things that I am/or was better at then most other people and how adhd may have played a role in their development and here's 3 I cam up with: 

1- Great short-term memory....I never studied in grade school. I would review spelling words or notes the morning of an exam and usually pulled out at least a B. However, this method completely failed me in college...helllllo 2.6 gpa! I still don't know how I even managed that....

2- I'm great at assessing a situation and quickly drawing a conclusion...because before medication...if I didn't, I'd forget to. 

3- I read people fairly well. Because I'd often get distracted before someone got to the point of their story, I'd hyper-focus on their body language, word choice and facial expressions to keep me engaged. Eventually, my subconscious starting categorizing and cataloging these responses and made it easy for me to separate when someone was lying or being genuine. 

So I'm curious. Does anyone else have ADHD superpowers you can think of?

I'm 25 now. I'm not here to debate the existence of ADHD as it was a night and day difference after I was diagnosed. 

My question with self discipline relates to failures due to ADHD. I've struggled so many times to do things I need to do. In 6th grade I grew so frustrated doing homework that I got burnt out. The struggle never realized a reward. My failures have almost made me numb to it, with no sense of reward from doing what I need to do(that i struggle with) and almost as if I've gotten so used to failing at what I want to do that I don't care anymore.

I have been trying to do some research intensive work. I let my deadline go and almost avoided thinking about it to protect myself from feeling like crap over it. I would go to the library, sit here and waste time.

So for a short amount of time I have been using strictpomodoro for chrome. It blocks sites for your pomodoro time, then releases them during your break. So i've managed to focus on work in 25minute bursts, and feel like I can go longer when I sort of get in the zone. I can stop myself from going to sites that I get distracted on. It feels good finishing one of those 25m blocks.

So much of my struggles have been related to lack of effort i've been putting forth because I hate the feeling of failing, and am a perfectionist. Anything less than what I deem acceptable causes a bit of anxiety. So I have the double edged sword of not putting enough time into my work due to distractions/saying fuck it because I have had so many struggles in the past, and also that if I don't do a great job on what I'm working on, I don't like it. One feeds into the other.

But me just buckling down, stopping myself from starting to be distracted has helped. The pomodoro technique has worked in the short time i've used it. Maybe all these years of failures could have been prevented with some more self discipline.

I also believe it is hard to build self discipline as I can't sustain focused long term effort to make a change, that little bit of me that says ""whatever, screw it"" when I need to do something, doesn't get checked and I let it go. Being late, sleeping late, incomplete assignments have been such a part of my life for so long that I just accept it as being me, and it is harming my work ethic and effort in life in general.

Just wanted to vent during my pomodoro break. Back to work.

Every thought takes effort.  Every accomplishment starts by feeling like I'm climbing a mountain.  

There are good hours and good days, and twice a year I have a good week, but the victories are transient.  The pain is always there.  It is playing the long game.

I am losing.  Even the good days are full of dread, knowing that eventually the pain will return, and I will fail.  

I just let things go.  I know I need to do things, but the pain of starting is so present, so intense, it makes so much sense to let it go.  The smallest tasks are the hardest.  The reward is so small, but the pain never changes size.

If people knew what was in my head, they would never trust me with anything ever again, but at least they would understand.  They don't understand.  They see flashes of greatness on the good days, and they imagine I can succeed.  They don't understand.  How could they when I never have.  All I know is failure is inevitable. 

The earlier people knew me, the higher their opinion of me is.  That can't be a good sign.   

The pain makes me cut corners, it makes me make mistakes, and my mistakes are chasing me.  Eventually they always catch me.  Sometimes my mind fills with dread for 15 minutes before I even realize what is happening.

I am anxious.  I am depressed.  I don't know what came first, and at this point it doesn't matter.  I take a powerful stimulant every morning and spend every day exhausted by fear.  

I was almost fired from my first job.  That finally convinced me to see a doctor, to get medicated.  Everything turned around for me, I became a star.  Now it's 6 years later and the cycle is repeated itself.  There's no magic bullet this time.  You can only fail so many times before people give up on you.  They've only waited this long because they don't understand. 

I desperately want to accomplish things.  They just makes it worse.  I can see victory dangling in front of my face, and it's close enough to touch.  It's taunting me.  

I'm too old for potential.  I'll be 30 this year.  Imagining that I'll figure it out someday .... I don't even indulge the fantasy anymore.  

I have suicidal thoughts.  They aren't real.  It just seems so final.  I'm a competitive person who stills harbors the delusion that I can fix myself.  I'm not ready to admit defeat.

He likened my troubles and symptoms to problems that everyone has, saying none of them are really anything specific to warrant a diagnosis. He is an old doctor (76 years old) and a part of me thinks that it is because he is older that he doesn't see this as a real issue.

I'm going back to see my family doctor later today and I am going to tell him that I did not get anything of use out of the session with the psych that I waited half a year for. I don't know what will happen from there but I just wanted to vent some frustration.",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,False,,,True,t3_sk44f,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/sk44f/after_5_months_of_waiting_i_finally_got_to_see_a/,

Now that I have been on them for a few weeks, she says that I have probably had anxiety because of the ADHD. 

I agree mostly because my anxiety is at an all time low whether I am on or off the Adderall. Is it possible that living with ADHD for so long without treatment caused my anxiety? Has anyone else had the same experience?

-Do any of you have lots of trouble being motivated to be social, or talk to your friends, even when you like them, so you might come off as rude? Look them straight in the eyes while they talk to you and not hear a damn thing they say because your mind is on mars? I get so exhausted around people and I wonder if it is some aspect of this or just my introversion and an unrelated thing.",,False,self,t5_2qnwb,False,,,True,t3_q2dlv,http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/q2dlv/hihas_anyone_experienced_this/,
