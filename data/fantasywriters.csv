1362960860.0,82,self.fantasywriters,1a1v1n,I met with an agent who had read the first 40 pages of my novel yesterday.,Kaladin_Stormblessed,87,5,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1a1v1n/i_met_with_an_agent_who_had_read_the_first_40/,"I attended a writing conference this past weekend.  It wasn't specifically fantasy-centric, but it was definitely a great place to network and talk to agents and editors.  One of the coolest things they did was offer in-person one-on-one sessions (for an extra $40) with an agent or editor of your choice, to look over the first 40 pages of your manuscript and offer advice on what you needed to do to get an agent's attention and get published.  I chose an agent who stated that she was interested in fantasy, formatted my first three chapters according to their requirements, and sat back to wait.

This is the first time a professional has looked at my writing (I haven't tried sending query letters since my first stab at this 8 years ago).  I was *extremely* nervous.  Apparently I didn't need to be.  She absolutely loved my first three chapters, the first thing she said was ""OK... I **have** to know what happens next!""  She also enjoyed my prose and said that she adored the idea of a ""procedural 'cop' mystery in a fantasy setting.""

She did give me some critiques, mostly concerning character voice, pacing (a very easy fix there) and world-building.  Then she said that once I had fixed those, she wanted me to send her the whole novel.  And she made me promise not to query anyone else.

This... is unbelievable.  It feels like a dream.  I realize that it's only the very first step (it's entirely possible that when she reads the whole thing she'll decide it's not for her), but it's honestly everything I could have hoped for.  I'm sort of in shock.  I spent the day today making notes on the world-building aspects which I hadn't spelled out clearly enough in the text (didn't exposition my magic system, conflicting cultural aspects, etc), and am hoping to have all that ironed out in the next few weeks so I can send her the complete manuscript and get her thoughts on it.

Originally I had planned this to be a five-book series in which each book could feasibly stand alone (sort of like Dresden Files), but she talked me down to a trilogy.  Selling a five-book series would be next to impossible, she said, but a trilogy was definitely do-able. Thankfully this is easily remedied as I didn't have much in the way of outlines for books 3-5, so I can cut #4 and roll 3 &amp; 5 into one.  So if you're a debut author and thinking about querying, that's something to keep in mind.

I also asked her whether we might face marketing issues given that my protagonists are bi and gay.  She said that it was possible that some publishers might worry that they wouldn't be able to market it and *might* ask me to change one of the main characters into a woman instead, but that she personally felt that there weren't enough gay characters in fantasy and she had no issues with it.  That's a decision I might have to make down the line if anyone is actually interested, but I hope it never comes up.  I don't think I would be willing to make that change, even if it meant losing out on a potential book deal.

But that, of course, is counting dragons before they're hatched.  For now, I'm ecstatic that someone ""in the industry"" (who has sold books to TOR... **TOR!**) liked my writing enough to request the whole book.  It gives me hope for my writing.  Hope that I might actually make this dream into a reality.

And you guys were a huge part of this.  Your critiques, discussions and support were a huge part of what kept me writing and gave me the courage to actually submit.  Thank you.  Thank you all so much.  I'll keep making posts as this ""journey... quest... thing"" progresses in the hopes that my experiences might help someone else.

If anyone's got any questions about the submission process, the conference, or anything else I'll be happy to answer them.  :)",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,title,True,t3_1a1v1n,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1a1v1n/i_met_with_an_agent_who_had_read_the_first_40/,

However... and you knew there would be a 'however...', didn't you?

However... if you take the time to polish your work before submitting it, the feedback you get will be much more useful to you in the long run.

Take a few minutes to poorfred it - fix those tyops, spelling errers, crazy run on sentences, duplicated words, duplicated ideas,  phrases that are clumsy, duplica... you get the idea.

It's not that people can't read past that. It's that when you fix those problems, you'll probably find yourself restructuring lines, paragraphs, maybe even the whole story. 

Personally I find it very useful to read the piece aloud, as a final editing pass. It's amazing what you can catch if you do that, especially if you read it to someone else.

That 'final' version is what you really want people to give you input on. It's a much better use of your time and energy, even if it does delay the gratification of getting input.

And trust me, this is something I struggle with every week. I'm putting this out there as much to remind myself, as anyone else.

Should I still try for it after so long?,karizizi,35,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/19vwan/its_been_almost_10_years_since_ive_looked_at_my/,"I was 11 years old when I made the first variation of a fantasy story that would be a trilogy and continued to do so as my writing evolved for the better. I had other people read it and said it was decent but I started to fall into the ""it's not good enough syndrome."" I finally abandoned the project, went to college and tucked the manuscript away into an old computer file. 

Fast forward to me at 20 years old. I enrolled in a Storytelling class and the guy that taught it was this hilarious ol' Brit who (apparently) was part of their Secret Service and was the military adviser for the movie 'Aliens'. 

I don't know how we got on topic but one day he asks everyone 'who in here has written a completed novel?' Without thinking I sheepishly raise my hand. He smirked and asked me how many pages. I told him and then he proceeded to ask another 20 questions. Finally (in front of everyone mind you), asked me to bring the printed manuscript for him so that he may read it. I did. 

I can't begin to tell you the anxiety I felt that someone else (besides my close friends, brother and myself) was going to read this story. And even worse when he finally decided to tell me he thought it was good enough to read some parts in class. 

The day he returned my manuscript is the day I really can't stop thinking. I walked up to his podium and this guy just looked at me straight in the eye still holding on to my binders. I felt awkward 'cause he wouldn't let go. He said, “Don't give up on it.” -or something along those lines. Honestly, the look is what really got to me, like he was afraid I wouldn't actually listen to him.

I am 26 today and that same manuscript sits on my desktop. I don't know why this matters or why I'm posting. I guess these past months my story just won't get out of my head and writing this will actually give me the courage to look at it again.

I bought it for $1 in the Kindle store to show my support, and mentioned I will try to review it once I'm done. I always try to review books once I'm done, I'm just a very slow reader though. Trouble is, it is seriously bad, I'm cringing on every page, and I'm in utter disbelief, and its painful to move forward. Supposedly, he has written other stories, but this was the one he felt comfortable and confidant in sharing with the world. What should I do? I'm worried that the next time I see him, he'll ask me if I finished the book or ask me to write a review on Amazon for it. The only review he has is from his mother, and even that sounds forced and a bit tongue-in-cheek like ""oh yea, it's a page-turner..."" My friends refuse to read it, after reading the free sample. They aren't even gonna go there.

This book has spelling errors, fragmented sentences, run-on sentences, lists of adjectives when he's describing something, then there's boring and vague descriptions like ""he had beautiful eyes"" and then it moves on. At one point, he even switched the name of a main character! I guess the search-and-replace feature on Word missed it. There's an unlikable narrator voice who is just throwing out unnecessary foul language and odd references that don't flow: ""she thought Edward Cullen was sexy"" or ""her dad went to the titty bar"" or ""he reminded her of an elf from Lord of the Rings"" or ""her dad thought Obama was a nigger."" I'm not kidding you! And it literally has nothing to do with the story! Then there are slews of too fanciful words that he must have gotten from the thesaurus, a plot that is going absolutely nowhere, characters that are full of themselves or just plain stupid tropes. There's an over-usage of the same words, dry dialog that feels more like a lecture of backstory than actual communication... The list could go on. I feel like this is a joke. Like is this for real? Sadly, it is.

**TL;DR:** This book a friend published is terrible. I bought it, he knows I did. What do I do now? Do I just let this all wash over, fade away until he forgets? What if he confronts me on how its going? Or asks me to do an Amazon review?

The idea for this month's challenge was based on a suggestion from redditor FearlessBurrito.

Basically, the idea behind the challenges is to keep our writing skills honed.  Of course, there's nothing wrong with a little friendly competition on the side.  The winner of each month's challenge will receive special ""challenge champion"" flair for the month following their win.  For instance, if you win this month's challenge, you'll have challenge champion flair for all of January. 

**Your Challenge:** Write a *short*, fantasy story (no more than 8,000 words) beginning with this sentence: ""I guarantee you won't find the same quality for a cheaper price,"" the merchant insisted.

On December 27, I will post a submission thread, where competitors can post links to their stories.  Downvotes will be disabled in this thread and voters will be encouraged to upvote only one story.  Whichever story has the most upvotes by January 1 will be declared the December challenge champion.

**Notes**

* In the future, a full week may be provided to vote on stories.  Since we're getting a late start this month, I've shortened the voting period to allow more time for writing.

* Challenges will differ from month to month.  The same length restrictions applied to this challenge will not apply to others, etc.

* I am aware that short stories are difficult for many people, and that starting with a quote can be quite tricky.  That's why it's called a ""challenge.""

I look forward to reading everyone's submissions.  Happy writing!

/r/Fantasy has launched a weekly process where anyone with a completed story (short or long format) can sign up to be the Fantasy Writer of the Day.

Every Wednesday, /r/Fantasy will feature one writer and his/her works.  This is open to anyone who has written and completed a short or long fantasy story.  Self-published or indie published; free or paid - it doesn't matter as long as at least one story is complete.  

Goal here is to formalize a process to give some exposure to potential fans via the /r/Fantasy community.

**DETAILS &amp; STEPS**

1)  To qualify, have at least one **completed** story that can be accessed or bought on the web.  (Link to download or Amazon.com purchase or other.)

2)  [Sign up here and nab a Wednesday.](http://redditfantasy.youcanbook.me/)  Mark your calendar.

3)  [Print off instructions here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_IgR3hGS8Y7h98NCrMohYT5RuyaSk6RcScMOnc-hw6c/edit?usp=sharing)

(These instructions are written for those who aren't as familiar with reddit.  Feel free to PM me with any corrections.)

4)  Follow the instructions to self-post on the Wednesday you signed up.  Late mornings are usually best.

5)  Leave a message with the /r/Fantasy mods that you posted and we'll set you up with some confirmation and writer flair.

6)  Feel free to get that link out to friends and fellow writers for support - comments, questions and the like.  Treat it a bit like an AMA.

 /u/LyndseyLuther (aka /u/Kaladin_Stormblessed) just did one as a recent test-run and it worked out well for her.  [Feel free to check it out here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1cjc4y/reddit_fantasy_writer_of_the_day_lyndsey_luther/)

When they are born, the parents go to a seer or the like and find out when and who their child will marry, as one of them will be born a few years after the other. In a few cases it may be hundreds of years of waiting. 

Does that drive the elf in question insane? Sometimes it does, and sometimes it doesn't. Usually such people are messed up in the head and become mercenaries or soldiers, and they pitied and slightly feared by the rest of society. Now, how do I come up with a word to describe such a person? 

Or what about just naming fantasy foods or animals? I keep heading into Airbender territory and wanting to call creatures wolfbearcat, and that's not good enough for me.

1371124637.0,21,self.fantasywriters,1g9gqs,"Write a story, not a setting (XPost from /r/scifiwriting)",Tellenue,24,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1g9gqs/write_a_story_not_a_setting_xpost_from/,"One of the main complaints in genre fiction today is the amount of information the reader receives. It’s easy to set a scene that a reader is familiar with. But a new world, or galaxy, filled with strange sentient life? That’s an awful lot of information to throw at a reader. It was an awful lot of information for you as the writer to come up with, too. It’s a big accomplishment, without doubt. But all that effort means nothing if there’s no story to tell within it.

But what constitutes a setting? Most people answer with ‘the time and place a story takes place in’. So one answer could be Victorian Paris. Another could be in an arm of a distant galaxy. But the place isn’t the only thing that creates the setting. The general populace creates it too, and their cultures. Languages. All those things that go into your worldbuilding, before you even decide who the protagonist is. 

Which is the problem, right there. To write about the struggle between two cultures isn’t a story. Broad stroke generalizations about the deep-set hatred between dwarves and elves is setting, even if you have one dwarven and one elven character that are forced to team up. It shouldn’t be a situation where you throw two characters together and they espouse for page after page about why their point of view is correct. Or go into the nuances of the conflict every time they open their mouths. 

What is your central conflict?

Ask yourself that every time you start a scene. The central conflict IS the hatred between the insectoid Klicklaks and the hated avian Flutters? Then how does that play out? If your piece sounds like a history lesson given by Ben Stein, then you’re providing the reader with setting again. Conflicts are personal. Each character has one, and each character has at least one person that embodies those things they hate. Characters need to act (have agency), and for that action to mean something, it must be opposed (Newton’s laws are even applicable to writing! Who knew!). Who is the opposing force? Ideas are not opposing forces! Ideas create the opposing forces, getting into the minds and guiding the actions of the antagonists. Your character may hate the concept of wanton abuse of natural resources, but without someone to struggle against, what makes him any different than a blogger sitting on a recliner sipping tea while they type out a scathing rebuke on their iPad? And that rebuke is nothing more than setting- creating the environment in which the conflict exists (Here is the situation, and here is the counter argument against it). It’s this small difference that causes confusion, and ends up creating genre writing that is nothing more than elaborate setting. 

Be aware of your characters, of their individual conflicts, and what constitutes conflict for them. If it’s an action they perform, it’s story. If it’s the reason behind the situation that prompts the action, it’s setting. Keep your work focused on story. While actions require setting to have meaning, setting itself is not the story.

**Your Challenge:** A common theme in literature (especially where fantasy is concerned) is growing up and coming of age.  In 5,000 words or less, write a fantasy piece around this theme.  This can mean a coming of age through experience, or include a fantastical rite of passage of your own design, etc.

On February 22, I will post a submission thread, where competitors can post links to their entries. Downvotes will be disabled in this thread and voters will be encouraged to upvote only one story. I will also be looking at the votes on RES, so even if someone's piece gets downvoted, I will only count the upvotes in final scores. Whichever story has the most upvotes by March 1 will be declared the February challenge champion. I look forward to reading everyone's submissions.

To prove his point he accepted a challenge to write a good story from a combination of bad ideas. The combination his challenger presented was ""Pokemon + The Lost Roman Legion.""

In order to claim it, you have to offer up another bad idea combination for someone else to claim. And on it goes.

1362396794.0,20,self.fantasywriters,19mteh,Share your rules of Magic!,BluApples,22,2,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/19mteh/share_your_rules_of_magic/,"*Sanderson's First Law of Magics: An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.*  

I've just finished another seven pages of my first draft and am ready for some fun! I thought I'd put out my rules of magic for ""Fighter, Mage, Thief"", to see what you all thought, and to find out more about the rules magic follows in your stories.  

In ""Fighter, Mage, Thief"", magic and science have progressed together, to the point that magic itself is a branch of scientific study. It is dangerous and tricky to do, but in theory anyone can learn how to do magic if they have the inclination and the patience to study it. Of course, some people are more ""apt"", and they tend to become the most powerful mages.  

Magic in the world of Jord involves four acts of will: The Sacrifice, The Thought, The Word and The Deed. These four elements are required for any act of magic.  

The complexity of the spell is kind of fluid, meaning that various spells can fall into different categories, but usually they are categorized as follows (from simplest to most complex):  

1. **Cantrips** are direct acts of magic with immediate effect. They draw their energies directly from the environment, or more commonly, from the body of the caster. From starting a small fire to telekineticly closing a door, the caster must judge the amount of energy required for the act and send it forth. The deed for starting a fire might simple be snapping one's fingers, and the word should not be something in the common language the caster speaks. Of course, the thought should be a clear image of the intended effect.  

2. **Charms** are wrought within a circle of power containment. Charms are basically cantrips that are bound in an object, usually released on the destruction of the object. There is a risk involved in creating charms, as there is when any spell is worked within a circle. Within the circle, the energies are contained and placid. But once the circle is broken, the spell will attempt to manifest. If the object of the charm is not strong enough to contain the cantrip, it can burst. Depending on the cantrip, this can be a minor annoyance or a complete disaster. Charms, as opposed to enchantments, are one time use only. They don't require direct sacrifice from the caster, a substitute sacrifice may be utilized (example, a crucible of boiling fat).  

3. **Workings**, more commonly referred to as spells, are magical effects that would completely drain a human life to cast if it were attempted as a cantrip. The sacrifice involved may be quite heavy, up to and including a murder of an innocent being. Staffs and wands usually form a part of the working, because the breaking of the circle casts the spell, and the energies involved can be very devastating. To begin a working, a cantrip may be used to destroy the sacrifice. An ""annihilate"" cantrip can reduce the matter of the sacrife to pure energy to charge the circle. breaking the circle at the wrong time, or having a circle that isn't strong enough to contain the energies of the cantip, can... be bad.  

4. **Enchantments** are like charms, but much, much more complex. The device the working is woven into must be complex enough to contain the workings within, but the plus side is that multiple workings can be woven into an enchanted item. Enchanting an item requires patience, craftsmanship, and and enormous amount of focus. They can take months to prepare, and since nothing can cross the circle, all food that the enchanter requires, as well as his or her (um) effluence, cannot cross the circle until the item is wrought and the item is enchanted. A certain boon with regard to enchantments is the ability to create an enchanted magic circle. This is a construction that will hold workings until they are needed. This gives a mage the ability to call upon a wider range of spells that his or her own body can contain.  

5. **Weavings** are great spells that only Sylphan sorcerers and Gods can create. They draw upon the universe itself as their sacrifice. The last weaving on Jord was 700 years ago, when the Sylphan Imagire channeled her own life force into the spell that diminished the Sylphan overlords of Jord, and caused them to flee from the planet.

To new redditors especially, it can be confusing to know what types of things should be posted here and what might do better on another subreddit, such as [r/fantasy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/)  It bums me out to have to tell people that their content doesn't belong here, and I'm not nearly cold-hearted enough to be a tyrannical mod who storms around deleting things with no explanation!  That being said, a handy guide on what to post to this subreddit seems like the ideal solution for everyone!

My goal with this post (now to be linked in the sidebar) is to give people a clearer idea of our subreddit's purpose, and thereby provide the most relevant content possible to all subscribers to r/fantasywriters.  R/fantasy is immensely good at what it does, and reddit does not require two subreddits for the same purpose.  Below, you will find some helpful tips about what sorts of material should be posted here and what shouldn't.

**If in doubt, the basic rule is that anything that doesn't directly address brainstorming, writing, editing, or publishing fantasy work would be better suited to another subreddit.**

______________________________________________________________________________________________


**Feel Free to Post**

* Your own fantasy writing for peer review, editing, etc.

* Links to sites and articles that provide writing tips, especially ones with a speculative fiction focus.

* Discussions or links to discussions/charts about the basic mechanics of writing fantasy.  For instance, feel free to ask [how others handle magic,](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/nfdow/magic_systems_what_kind_do_you_like_and_not_like/) [fantasy races,](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/nh8ok/from_funny_looking_humans_to_truly_alien_how_do/) or worldbuilding.

* Discussions about what you are writing.  This could mean sharing an idea for your new story, describing your magic system, or linking to an awesome map you created.

* Stories/advice about your own efforts to write or become published.

**The Following Belong on R/fantasy, so Please Don't Post Them Here**

* Links to lists like ""my five favorite fantasy novels.""  Unless you wrote those fantasy novels and want us to critique them, this should go somewhere else.

* Links to general, fantasy-themed articles, including reviews of books or movies.  Unless the article specifically addresses writing, post it to r/fantasy.

* Links to any stories you did not write.

* Anything that does not **directly** address the creation, writing, editing, or publishing of one's own fantasy work.


Please understand that I do not post this because I want to be in any way difficult.  I'm posting it because r/fantasy is amazing and it is not my intention to try to take over that community's job.

Opinions?,DKamar,21,1,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/19g5yn/worldbuilding_question_i_think_power_levels_would/,"My science fantasy universe has everything from normal guys to cosmic horrors strapped into human bodies. Cops armed to the teeth with magitech arrest dark gods. 

I figure the police and military forces would try to track, at least in broad terms, the power levels of as many combatants as they could. In my notes, I rank characters from F-A, with each rank basically meaning 'bring multiple people one rank lower, don't bother bringing any number of people two ranks lower unless you really want them dead'. F rank doesn't mean normal dude, btw, it's just the first rank worth noting.

Obviously the system is missing many people, has many people underrated because they've never fought anyone of a high enough rank or at least not on record (only 200,000 people at or above B out of 2,000,000,000 ranked fighters and a total population of 350 billion), etc. And there are people who are on the border of two ranks.

This makes sense to me, if only so militaries don't throw units away and cops don't try to arrest a god with a bunch of guys only slightly stronger than a normal human.

1359423292.0,18,self.fantasywriters,17gtxe,How To Take A Critique (and What to Say In Response) an Opinionatorization,jp_in_nj,23,5,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/17gtxe/how_to_take_a_critique_and_what_to_say_in/,"We've all gotten them: critiques that come across as actively hostile, where the critter seems to want to remake the story in their own writing style, who don't groove with the style or who Just Don't Get It At All. Our blood boils. Or maybe we remain calm and cool and only tell ourselves that This Guy/Gal is clueless. Either way, we want to respond. To correct them, to fill in all the things they don't know. If only they understood the whole thing, we think, THEN our work would be perfect and we wouldn't have to change a word. If only... 

Maybe that belief is true, or maybe it's not. (ProTip: Almost universally, it's not.) But here's the thing: 

**It Never Helps To Try To Educate The Critter After The Fact.**

No one is going to say ""My God! I was so *completely* wrong!"" We're all set in our ways; we're humans, that's how we're made. So when the author says to the critter ""You're wonderful but you're wrong, and here's why"" what the critter hears is ""You don't appreciate the work I did"" and ""You're calling me an idiot."" Defensiveness ensues, and anything from minor distaste to bloody havoc results.

So where do we go, then?

Here are the possibilities, as I see them:

* ""Thank you for your thoughts.""

  Believe it or not, that's usually sufficient. Most critters don't want to engage beyond the critique they've delivered; they've said what they want to say, and they're done with the piece. Gratitude is nice, it leaves a sweet taste. We can't go wrong with a simple thanks.

* ""Thank you for your thoughts. Here's what I was trying for {blah blah blah}. Guess it didn't work for you.""

  Explaining what the critter didn't know isn't useful; it comes post-hoc, and too late to inform a critique. What we can do, if we feel the need (I frequently do!), is to assume responsibility for the failure to open the intended mind-channel between the reader and the text, and then clarify our intentions. If the critter sees fit, s/he then has an open door for followup - ""If I'd seen this, maybe it would have...""


* ""Thank you for your thoughts. Here's what I was trying for {blah blah blah}. Guess it didn't work for you. If I'd... would...""

  In asking for speculative feedback, this one may or may not be presumptuous, depending on our relationship with the critter. But it still assumes responsibility, and recognizes that the text didn't do what the author intended for that particular reader.

At root, it boils down to one thing: the reader is **never** wrong in how they experience the text. They may not have the experience that the author wishes they had, and perhaps they'd have had a different experience if they'd known other stuff. But the experience they had is the experience they had. Telling the critter that they shouldn't have had the experience they had only asks for hard feelings and the perception of ingratitude... no matter how nicely the ""you're wrong"" notice is phrased.

So what do we do once we get that criticism?

1. First, no matter what the criticism, we need to look at it and make an effort to understand where the critter is coming from. Criticism is almost-always well-intended; it's important to realize that.

1. Second, what is the criticism REALLY criticizing? A critter might say ""these characters don't click for me,"" but what they might really mean is that the characters are providing information that isn't needed in the scene. Or that too many exclamation marks are used. Or that they don't believe that Character A really is an all-powerful wizard. It's useful to look at the criticism and to really try to understand what the critter was twigging to, even if they didn't entirely get it.

1. Third, how might the criticism--stated or implied--apply? Our initial reflex is often to reject anything that doesn't fit our model. Sometimes that makes sense - particularly if the critter is making an error (suggesting the clearly wrong word, rewriting with egregiously bad prose, etc.). But more often, because of where the reader is sitting, the change makes sense from their perspective. What would the effect be if the suggested change was applied? This is definitively **not** to say that all criticism should be taken. But in my experience, it's important not to reject criticism out of hand. 

1. Finally:

  * If the criticism is judged useful, and after consideration we decide to apply it... how can it be applied *to our piece* in a way that's congruent with what we're trying to do? At the end of the day, the work is ours, not a communal effort. Whatever we decide will make the piece better, it needs to come through in our own voice, telling our own story.

  * Or, if the criticism isn't judged useful . . . before responding, decide: does the critter really need to know? Obviously, from the above, I'd argue 'no'. Make the change or don't make the change; the critter's life will sail along just as merrily regardless.

1351007759.0,21,self.fantasywriters,11y95e,I commissioned some character concept art from a professional artist.  Here's how it went...,Kaladin_Stormblessed,23,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/11y95e/i_commissioned_some_character_concept_art_from_a/,"Thought I would do a little write-up on the experience in case anyone else was thinking about doing the same.  Every artist is different, of course, but I don't suspect that the steps will be very different.

I contacted him and asked if he were open to taking commissions, and what his asking price would be for an uncolored character sketch.  I referenced another of his pieces directly as an example of what I was looking for.  He quoted me a price, and we moved on to step 2.

I provided a description of the character and a couple of reference pictures.  This was the description I gave:

&gt; Suken Anisaria, a bounty hunter. 32 years old but looks young for his age, about 6’2”, green eyes, short sandy brown hair and usually clean-shaven. He’s doesn’t much care about cleanliness (which leads to him getting the nickname “Dusty”). Very lithe – he does a lot of running around on rooftops, not much good in a fist-fight. Weapon of choice is a small repeating crossbow which he usually hangs from a hook on his belt when he’s not using it. His defining feature is his hat, which he is rarely without and usually wears low enough to hide his eyes. He lives in a very rainy climate so he wears a thin leather poncho most of the time over his clothes. As for the clothes themselves… no idea, really. Feel free to do whatever you like in that regard. One of the things I like most about him is that he is very religious/superstitious. He has a bag of thin golden coins inscribed with a set of symbols which he’ll flip to ask his goddess for guidance (sort of like flipping a heads/tails thing)… then he’ll toss the coin to “the winds” to thank her. Personality: I think the best way to describe him is charmingly arrogant. He thinks the world of himself but in an “I can do no wrong” sort of way as opposed to an “I’m better than everyone else” way. He loves his job most of the time, and when he doesn’t, well… there’s always gin.

The artist confirmed that he would definitely be interested in the piece, and we decided on a final price.  I paid via paypal.  (Sorry, not willing to disclose the price.)

He sent me four thumbnail sketches of various poses and asked me to choose one.  A few days later he sent along a line-art sketch, and asked if there were anything I wanted changed.  I didn't particularly like how his gloves looked, so I mentioned that I'd like that changed.  He agreed and we moved on to the last step.

He sent a final image with grey-tones and asked if there were anything else I had issues with.  I didn't, so he sent me HQ files (including a layered PSD file) of the art and we were done!

[Here's the final product.](http://imgur.com/bIkej)

I specified that it would be fine for him to use on his DeviantArt or main website if he wanted to, and he said that he may do so if he makes a commission request post in the future.  

I'll likely be using this as marketing material when I finish the book, but for now it's just nice to have hanging up next to my desk.  It's amazing to see one of my characters really come to life on the page, and Ben absolutely nailed his personality.

**Your Challenge:** A few of you have requested a flash fiction challenge, so here it is.  This challenge requires a complete story in 1,000 words or less.  The catch is that *two of the following three sentences must appear in your story.*

**1.** The cut was more than just irritating.

**2.** He had never seen such riches.

**3.** The gurgling was repulsive.

On September 24, I will post a submission thread, where competitors can post links to their entries. Downvotes will be disabled in this thread and voters will be encouraged to upvote only one story. I will also be looking at the votes on RES, so even if someone's piece gets downvoted, I will only count the upvotes in final scores.

As the title says, I'd love to do some freelance editing. The more people I work with the more my name will spread. So here's the deal: I know that just about everyone on this sub is trying to save money as they get their work to the point of publishing. So am I. 

This is my offer. If you send me five sequential pages of your work I will edit them for free and get it back to you within one week at the very most. If you like the corrections I've made and would like me to edit more we can work out an arrangement. If you like what I've done and want to do the rest yourself you don't owe me a dime. 

I'm trying to break into the business so my rates are going to be extremely reasonable. If you're willing to give me a shot then I'll work hard to make your trust pay off. I look forward to working with you, and good luck on your works! 

Interested parties please PM me.

[**MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**]

Abercrombie defies most conventional fantasy tropes in his work which can be refreshing but also sort of frustrating as he almost does it to a fault where *nothing* will be as it seems and almost every character ends on an inconclusive note. His story is realistic to the point that at the end it felt like nothing was really changed or gained and there were several loose ends and a lack of closure for a lot of the subplots. It might have just been me but I don't think he even fully explained everything completely. It left me feeling like a lot of the novel wasn't needed for such a weakly coherent ending.

Generally reviews I have read online have been quite positive reveling in the fact that it was ""original fantasy"" but I can't help but think the ending was mundanely weak.

Anyways even if you haven't read the First Law trilogy I would love to hear your guys' take on fantasy endings and how they should be handled after a reader puts in a lot of time and emotion into a novel (not so much happy vs. sad endings just more what makes an ending successful).

I've come up with a more solid idea, and have been slowly building on it over the last 20 months or so (not a whole lot of writing to show yet, but tons of notes and ideas). 

I have however considered that starting off with an epic series with high stakes and big conflicts might be unwise, at least right off the bat. Making the setting believable in its size and depth, and its characters and places real seems very important before bringing any 'apocalyptic' conflict into play.

On that note, I figured it would be a good idea to write short stories (and maybe a stand-alone novel or two) in this setting, to give the world breadth and depth before diving into the big series I want to write. The benefits would be:

1.) Practice with writing and refining my 'style'

2.) Develop characters, themes and places in smaller-scale tales first

3.) Have a great 'eco-system' set up and a really great world 'built' before the big series brings the big guns, so to speak.

I recently released my [first novel](http://www.amazon.com/The-Reintegrators-ebook/dp/B00DD0UQCG) on Kindle and in paperback. Some of you probably saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1gskj1/i_uploaded_my_first_novel_to_amazon_a_week_ago/) I made earlier detailing how it came about. If so and you're sick of hearing about me then I apologize.

I also apologize for steering the conversation in this sub away from craft stuff and toward the marketing side of things. The reasons I'm posting here are A) you're all generally a very helpful bunch of people B) /r/selfpublish is sort of dead C) I have seen cases where writers in this sub have been successful selling books (and it doesn't take much to qualify as a success in my mind) D) There's a lot of marketing advice out there which isn't necessarily focused on fantasy, and I think one of the keys to marketing is focusing directly on people who are most interested in your book, not casting a wide net.

So, without further ado, here are the things I am at least considering doing. They're divided into two phases: things worth doing before I have some reviews, and things to do assuming I can get reviews (and assuming people actually like the book):

**Phase 1: No Reviews**

- Tweet, facebook, blog as usual.

- Ask friends/family to spread word.

- Add book to Goodreads lists.

- Add info to Shelfari (see http://musingsonminutiae.com/articles/promoting-marketing-shelfari/).

- I'll be the /r/Fantasy FAOTD in mid-July

- Message users on Goodreads and Amazon and ask for a review in exchange for a free copy. See http://www.reddit.com/r/Write2Publish/comments/1aqkjq/dos_and_donts_or_getting_reviews_for_your_book/. The part of this I'm dreading will be figuring out books similar to mine. I've always been bad at this.

- Possibly: Goodreads book giveaway. Not sure if Goodreads users will participate unless they know the book is good already. Also not sure how to let people know the giveaway is happening (does Goodreads notify people automatically?). Then again, I have seen other giveaways where like 500 people applied to win 5 books, and the authors then took those usernames and used them to trade free ebooks for reviews.

- I'll be ordering a half-dozen paperbacks to bring with me to Worldcon in late August. I also might get some cards printed with a QR code that will bring people to a free review copy of the e-book.

**Phase 2: Things to consider if I get good reviews**

- Paid listing sites like Goodkindles

- Free KDP Select days

- Low price promotions e.g. http://www.pixelofink.com/ or http://www.bookbub.com/advertise/ (expensive but may be worth it).

- Paid Ads: Google Adwords, Project Wonderful, etc.

- Submitting to review blogs.

**Things I'm aware of but not hot on**

- Blog tour. Not sure I'm a fan of these, seems like a big time investment and I've never heard of great results for scifi/fantasy.

- Free short story set in the story's world. Unfortunately, the way the novel is set up, introducing the world would create some major spoilers and ruin people's enjoyment of the book. Also, I've never had any luck getting Amazon to price match things.

So, if anyone has ideas I haven't covered, or comments on things I'm already considering, please let me know. And if I start questioning you, please don't take it as me being ungrateful/a dick. It's just that I'm trying to find activities that maximize the bang I get for my time; that way I can spend more time writing.

Submissions welcome.",,26,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/v8fm2/hey_rfantasywriters_im_the_editor_of_efiction/,"eFiction is a magazine that I started two and a half years ago. Since that time it has grown to become one of the top fiction magazines around the world. It is the [#1 Top Rated on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/top-rated/digital-text/2460163011/ref=zg_bs_tab_t_tr?pf_rd_p=1331612862&amp;pf_rd_s=right-8&amp;pf_rd_t=2101&amp;pf_rd_i=list&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=1RMAJJ4NBB7SCP6HY58C) and is read all around the world. I wish to duplicate that success with eFiction Fantasy. 

Part of the reason for eFiction's success is that the magazine is run in an inclusive rather than exclusive fashion. Most magazines have editors/staff that exist in an ivory tower that is inaccecible to readers and writers. eFiction is the exact opposite. It is a thriving writing community that also happens to create a monthly magazine. Editors, writer, readers, and artists mingle together to produce the issues.

eFiction Fantasy will be created in much the same way. So we've got a gated fantasy workshop, fantasy editors, fantasy fans, and a fantasy publication to promote and compensate the writers who participate. It is a functioning business that anyone can volunteer to ""work"" for (if you can call this work). 

So we're accepting short story submissions for our inaugural issue. I will be tapping into my existing audience for promotion, but I cannot give actual numbers of traffic. eFiction Magazine has ~5000 monthly readers. eFiction Fantasy may have more or fewer. It is impossible to know at this point. 

Compensation will be based on a % of the first paycheck I receive from Amazon. 50% goes to the managing editor of the issue and the rest will be split fairly among the contributors. Again, I cannot give firm numbers, but you'll be able to track its progress based on the sales rank (http://www.novelrank.com is great for that) and I'll be as transparent with the data as I can be without breaking the law (Amazon enforces an NDA on sales figures with the Kindle Periodicals). 

I really want to launch this magazine off with a big bang, so send us your best!

I'm more interested in seeing fellow writers' thoughts about good and evil in our characters.)

I recently saw Man of Steel. (And there will be spoilers for it in this blog, so if you haven't seen it yet, then avoid this blog.)

Twice.

A lot of reviews have been thrown around it, and it's getting pretty mixed reviews from critics (but universally good ones from audiences... go figure.). I saw it with my dad today - Father's Day - and some of those scenes with Pa Kent really hit home for me. Reminded me of my dad.

But this isn't a post about Father's Day and dads supporting and believing you're special (that could be one all on its own), this is a post about another theme brought up by the movie, and by Superman in general. It's the question we ask ourselves - a question we see time and time again - of good and evil.

Just as evidence, here are many different philosophers, scientists, artists, writers, politicians and regular joes who have weighed in on the concept of good and evil:

I am in politics because of the conflict between good and evil, and I believe that in the end good will triumph. - Margaret Thatcher

The battle line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man. - Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

Mankind is not likely to salvage civilization unless he can evolve a system of good and evil which is independent of heaven and hell. - George Orwell

One should see the world, and see himself as a scale with an equal balance of good and evil. When he does one good deed the scale is tipped to the good - he and the world is saved. When he does one evil deed the scale is tipped to the bad - he and the world is destroyed. - Maimonides


There is only one good, knowledge, and one evil, ignorance. - Socrates

 Clearly, this issue of good and evil is one on the forefront of many minds. 

Now, just bringing up the nature of morality raises many individual questions. We ask ourselves how to be good, whose good is the real good, why is this good different from this man's good, and so and so forth. But I want to look at three questions: What is good? What is evil? What is their place in our society, specifically, our fiction?

So, onto good. Why is it that people find Superman boring?  A lot of these articles and people who say the Man of Tomorrow is boring is that he is too powerful: a laundry list of superpowers that keeps on expanding and only two weaknesses. Which is fair enough, we like our heroes to not be the baddest dudes on the block (except for Achilles, Hercules, pretty much every action movie guy, etc). We like them to have something to overcome. What does Superman have to overcome when he can literally bench press two planets?

But that is neither here nor there. Some people say that Superman is too good. He's a boyscout, a stickler for the rules. He has no personality other than his unflinching resolve to help. He has no flaws (and this is an important point which we'll come back to in the evil section). He is naive, childishly so.

So why the dislike of pure good? Is it because we don't see it in ourselves? Is it that we don't see the perfect law abiding and defending citizen, the Good Samaritan, the self sacrificing Nazarene? Is it that Superman does not represent an ideal that is the best of us, but one we could never hope to achieve? Perhaps. But perhaps not. There are many stories of people doing good deeds with no hope of reward and the only motivation being their good nature. You don't need me to link to these, you probably have a couple yourself, where either you or another was helped by someone's kindness. This, I posit, is goodness: helping others, advancing humanity, kindness. If someone comes away with a warm feeling or the better for your actions, then it is good. This is not limited to others: you can perform a selfish, good action, in my mind. More often than not that doesn't work, but we have actions that wholly benefit ourselves but do not help others. But more on that in the evil section.

Perhaps we dislike Superman because he is the best of us, but he is an impossibility: we are not good all of the time. We may have spurts of goodness, but we are not always doing good actions. We have evil in us as well, which is our next topic.

Evil, I think, is something that harms. That is it's purest definition in my mind. Good helps; evil hurts. This can go for hurting others: Hitler's genocide is certainly an evil action as he killed millions of people. This can go for hurting yourself: self mutilation is evil, to some degree, because you are wounding a piece of humanity, and hindering us as a whole, even with the loss of just yourself. Imagine how many people who have committed suicide who might have revolutionized science with a few more years of thought, or saved someone else's life? This is why selfish actions often are evil, because by nature of a selfish action, someone typically has to lose something for another to gain.

There is certainly grey area to this: perhaps a hero harms himself in order to help others. This is self sacrifice and it is considered one of the greatest goods of our world. It is called valor by some, and the Christ himself said there was no greater love. The helping of others outweighs the harm one does to their self in order to help the other. Perhaps it even helps the soul of the one sacrificing. Superman seems to benefit from giving up his own desires on a day to day basis.

Now, where does this go into writing? Into art? Into creating? Where does good and evil fit into our characters? You might notice that people that Superman was boring because he was TOO good. He had no evil in his bones. Recent stories, like the movie Man of Steel or that game Injustice: Gods Among Us, have tried to make Supes relevant by making him morally ambiguous. This is certainly interesting, but I don't believe its true to Superman's character completely. He is an Ideal. He is an extreme, and we need that. We should have a character represent utter good in fiction. He won't grow, perhaps, but he is someone by which you measure all others in their goodness, and you can see how the develop and grow as characters BECAUSE we have an ideal of good, a standard of morality, as it were. The same for evil. Someone should be the standard, the measure, the ideal of evil. We need our Galactus, our Dark One, our Nyarlothotep, our Satan.

But we prefer our main characters, our protagonists, even our main antagonists, to be ambiguous. We want our hero to struggle to overcome things, because we struggle to overcome things. We want to relate to our heroes. We want them to have tinges of evil in the good, to have selfish, conflicting emotions. And we want our villains to sometimes be... well, kind. Perhaps they have a soft spot in their hearts. It makes them human, and that's what we like stories of, is humans. Because we are.

Anyways, that's all for now. It's quite a long post and I apologize for that (and also that I wrote this instead of working on Book 2 but I'll do that now). But I'd like to hear your thoughts on good and evil.

I'm just going to go ahead and dig into the reasons that I *strongly* dislike the concept of ""character flaws"". Here's why.

Insisting on applying a flaw to your character is the same as treating your character like one of those flat cardboard dolls with magnetic clothing where you can mix and match the outfits. And you don't want to make them look preppy so you give them a magnetic patch on their knee.

It's like those brand name designer jeans that have pre-ripped holes.

...

A character is a *person*. Think of people you know and consider how limited it is to qualify them based on a list of strengths and weaknesses. Better yet, if you've ever been on a dating site and written up that 'about me' blurb I guarantee you didn't write ""Very skilled at x, y, z, good with people, but is easily stressed out under pressure, has aversion to SUVS because a pet was run over by one when I was a kid, and often I am bad at reading the subtext of what people are saying to me"" No. Not even close. 

If you are writing a character thinking that a few character flaws makes them interesting you have a problem, because basically what you are doing is taking a cardboard cutout, a Mary Sue, and tacking on a few hipster/grunge style accessories. 

So that's great, if your powerful charismatic and usually successful MC  is moody, loses their temper in stressful situations, and doesn't know how to deal with small children, that doesn't make them a developed character, because it doesn't make them a person. And they are basically still a Mary Sue.

...

There's no easy fix for this. There's no recipe for having an interesting character, just as there's no quick secret to writing a good novel. But I will suggest a few strategies that might help.

What you want to do is get in your character's head, or at least know them as well as your brother or sister or cousin that you grew up with. Some of the best tools out there are the interview style list of questions to answer, but that will only get you so far. It's still a list of *facts*, and that's just not going to cut it.

The best approach to this might be writing your character into a bunch of different scenes. By this, I mean consider situations that someone might get into or happen around them and write your character into that scene and explore their behavior. This should not be a scene in your novel. Maybe try writing them in a modern setting - if your character is well developed enough, just because they don't have a sword or magic doesn't mean they won't be the same person. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT RIGHT HERE. *The character is not defined by attributes like being a swordsman or a mage*. That experience might have shaped them, but if you strip away the skills and stick them in a bar in NYC or California or the middle of the Sahara in 2013 they should still be pretty much the same person. Their core personality remains the same. They are still the person they are at the start of the novel, with whatever experiences, traumas, successes, and so on that they might have. 

And to truly know someone you need to know two things: how do they perceive themselves, and how do others perceive them? And again, *not a list of facts or adjectives* but a real overview. 

So write a scene, where your character is experiencing something and it's very much their point of view. Write this scene that is not about plot, is not necessarily even relevant to your novel or your world, but stands alone, is introspective. 

Now write that same scene from the perspective of someone else in the vicinity, watching your MC do whatever is it they do. Stay completely in the head of this outside character, having them know NOTHING about your MC other than what they observe.

...

That's one of many things you can do to get to know your character. It may not work for you, and it may not be enough. Really, all you can do is try to think of your character as a *fully formed person*. Brains are incredibly complex things, with conscious and subconscious floating around on many levels, while many different senses relay complex information that is interpreted in many ways. 

So if your current description of your character to yourself is a list of positive attributes and flaws, you have some work to do. And even if it isn't, there's always more you can do to learn the inner workings of your character's mind, and *why* they are the way they are.

...

TL;DR: characters should not be defined by a few strengths and weakness, so instead of thinking of flaws, try and get a broad understanding of your character as a fully formed person.

FINAL NOTE: I can't believe this turned into such a rant, sorry. It just bothers me when people say their character has these 3 flaws that supposedly makes them developed and interesting.

I haven't quite matched things up with a real world equivalent) and I need to describe the effect of the blood loss and sickness. Now for a white person you could say drained, pale, gray...but if someone is dark, while technically you would lose 'warmth' because there's less blood under the skin in the face or the blood is colder or whatever, what is exactly would be a good way of describing this for darker skin?

**Please Avoid:** Using twists on already existing races, such as fey, orcs, elves, dwarves, or [The Planet of Hats](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats) trope.

On August 25, I will post a submission thread, where competitors can post links to their entries. Downvotes will be disabled in this thread and voters will be encouraged to upvote only one piece. I will also be looking at the votes on RES, so even if someone's piece gets downvoted, I will only count the upvotes in final scores.

Whichever piece has the most upvotes by September 1 will be declared the August challenge champion.

I look forward to reading everyone's submissions. Happy writing!

Everyone has a story *behind* their story, so what's yours? Is there a reason you write fantasy in particular?


One minor reason that triggered my desire to write when I was younger was that I was sick and tired of unoriginal fan-fiction crap. Don't think I'm bashing all fan-fiction, though. Some can be very good. But when I first learned of it, it was when all the other girls my age were writing themselves in as Harry Potter's new love interests, or vampires in Forks, Washington and it got annoying very quickly. So I wrote original settings, characters, plots, etc.


I write fantasy because I find it much more fun and exhilarating than our normal world, as a lot of you said below. I like experimenting with different cultures, magic, myths, and bending the rules of what is ""normal."" I played video games and watched television shows or movies that fed my addiction. I wanted to submerge myself in their worlds, but couldn't. So I began writing my own stories.


I also began writing when I was younger to battle dyslexia. I didn't read much as a kid because I took too long and it was stressful to keep up with classmates or weekly journal assignments in English classes. Creative writing, however, allowed me my own pace with which to work with and is --for the most part-- a calming activity. I think over the years, it certainly has helped expand my vocabulary and knowledge of certain topics, since I actually enjoy doing research for my novel.


I actually started up a role-playing game on a ProBoards forum a while back, to give my writing a test run and see if people who aren't my friends, teachers, or family members would enjoy my writing. It was quite fun and successful, lasting a few years, but then my first year of college hit me and then there were 3 deaths in my family. Suffice to say, I closed down the site, and couldn't find the time, energy, or will to write.


Now, I'm in a happier place since then; with a loving boyfriend of 2 years, straight A's this past semester, a steady job on campus. I feel like I can write again; the world has certainly given me fuel to add to my creative writing fire once again.


So yea... why do you write?

Actually that seems just like a rough draft for a real story. You, as a writer, know what happens, there's this awesome fight scene in the beggining, then you know soon it comes this genious and story-changing conversation between some characters, then this, then that... But you can't do it that way.

For example, in book I've started writing there is this exciting happening at the very beggining, but it takes some time 'till next big thing happen. What to write in between those key points? My protagonist is going to his apartment, questioning himself, then I describe some mundane activities he's doing like showering, eating and stuff, and I find it hard to make it interesting, simply because nothing really fun happens at that point of the story. What to do?

I analysed how J.K.Rowling does it, but she's using cheap tricks, as soon as one key point happens she writs two paragraphs at most, where Harry is thinking about everything happening at moment, then Ron rushes in yelling about something strange happening at the moment so they go there. And so on. But I find it hard to be believable in a mature, not-for-children story.

I've heard an interesting tip about this issue, and that is to look at each chapter as a sum of few smaller stand-alone stories with their own punchline, related by same characters in every of them, and merging few stories into a chapter with cliffhanger at the end, and so on. But, when this big things are not happening I don't know how to make these ""little stories"" entertaining.

Any advices?

Here's me introducing myself and asking for help,Galokot,20,3,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/17bygj/a_subreddit_for_fantasy_writers_fantastic_heres/,"Hello r/fantasywrtiers! I only just found out about this subreddit today, and am pretty ecstatic about this place! I'm looking forward pouring through the topics, successes of fellow writers and commentaries from you all! Got a chance to read some of them before writing up this block of text. it brings me a lot of pleasure knowing I'm not the only one. I mean, granted I'm not, but seeing it is another thing entirely. From reddit even! This has made my day :) 

I'm going to be reading, writing, suggesting possible editing (I'm the Editor in Chief of our university's academic journal, and enjoy reading new ideas and providing commentary. I'm here for fresh input if you need me!) and laughing along with the rest of you for the next decade or so, or however long it's going to take to write the book I want to write. 

Which is why I'm writing this today. And why I'm here.

I'm 21 and have been working on the bones of a story for the past 2 years. One I'm very excited for. Unfortunately, I've only ever written background and world building. The world brings me a lot of pleasure, though in places the history makes me sad. Sometimes I'd like to think that's what good world building is, but I wouldn't know. I'm new at this.

It's a fantasy, and of a kind I know has not been done or approached before. The day I came up with the thought, I sat down on my laptop for 6 hours on the topic and poured through every novel, flash-fic and story on the internet with that concept, and was surprised to see it only pop up as devices or symbols, but that was about it.

Aside from my twin sister, you're all the first I'm going to tell. It's on the Tarot. I'm hoping I will be providing a new, fresh element to the fantasy convention that has just been a plot device for stories of other genres. But the size and scope of it is pretty daunting, and I've only written poetry and 2 page prologues to other stories before. 

I'm taking my first creative writing class this quarter at my university this Senior year. I'm an English Literature emphasis and have gotten the chance to read a lot of classical writers, epic poems, and fantasy in the breadths and scales I hope to accomplish myself.

Anything in new novels you've seen that don't do their worlds/characters justice? Or just advice for getting started on the manuscript and tear myself away from the world-building? I would appreciate anything really.

1337334503.0,16,self.fantasywriters,tt2h9,Repost from /r/writing: Dos and Don'ts of Getting Reviews for your Books,MichaelJSullivan,18,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/tt2h9/repost_from_rwriting_dos_and_donts_of_getting/,"When I find myself commenting inline about something that others seem to find helpful I'll try to pull it out to its own thread so I can put several ideas in one place.  Keep in mind that the following is ""my personal opinion"" and not presented as ""gospel"" but some may find it helpful.

Reviews are a good way of establishing credibility of a work. In fact, I don't think an author should spend a huge amount of time ""promoting"" a book until you get at least double digit (10+) reviews on Amazon and preferably 15+.  

**Venues to Concentrate on** 

I personally care most about Amazon and goodreads. Amazon because they are the 800 pound gorilla and goodreads because it is so easy to target people who should like the type of book you write. There’s not enough time in the day to “do it all” so the venues I neglect is Barnes and Noble  and the ibookstore. To be honest I don’t even know what my numbers are on those sites.
My series is published two different ways: self-published (6 book Oct 2007 – August 2011) and traditionally (3 books Nov 2011 – Jan 2012)  my numbers are:

* Amazon Traditional: 220, Self:400
* Goodreads Ratings Traditional:2,116, Self 4,531
* Goodreads Reviews Traditional: 406, Self 649


**Paid Reviews**

I’m opposed to paid reviews.  There are a few reasons for this.

* The “good ones” are expensive (Kirkus $425 for standard, $575 for advanced), that’s a lot of money for one review.

* No matter how much they claim to be “unbiased” readers it’s hard not to divorce from your mind that he who pays the piper gets to call the tune

* To me the reek of desperation

There was a book I was remotely interested in because of a “good review” by a site I wasn’t familiar with – so I clicked through and found out that it was a paid review site and it made me lose all interest in the book.  I just don’t think the risk of alienation is worth the small benefit to get one review.

**Review Trading**

From time to time a new writer will come up with what they think is a great idea…review trading. It sounds like the perfect synergistic relationship to help each other out but it’s a potential land mine and I really recommend not doing this. Consider the following:

What if the other person's book sucks?  Then what do you do? 

* You don't want to ""go on record"" singing praises and then look like a fool.

* What if they don't like your book and give you a bad review?  Do you give them a crappy review back?

* To give an ""honest"" review you have to read their book and that is time best spent writing other books
* What if they don't post a review?(Perhaps because they didn’t like it and didn’t want to say bad things) then you end up with nothing.
* If your book only has a few reviews, and a reader digs a little bit, will they suspect somethings a foot?  Yes…and they’ll be vocal about it.  You don’t want any possibility of “impropriety” when it comes to reviews.
I’m all for supporting one another as writers. So if you read someone’s book and you like it…by all means review it.  They might notice and do the same for you, just don’t make a “formal” arrangement.

**Sock Puppets, Friends and Family** 

It should go without saying that padding reviews with fake accounts or cajoling your friends and family to post reviews just isn’t a good idea.  I know when you are starting out the desire for reviews can drive you to do irrational things. But again, you don’t want to provide any fodder for people to discount the validity of reviews. If a friend feels compelled to write a review (or if you see someone who you know post something) you might even contact them and ask them to make a disclaimer.  Something like: NOTE: For the record Michael is a member of my critique group and I initially read the book to support his writing, that being said, I really enjoyed this story and my comments are not based on my personal relationship with him.

It’s a very sad and disappointing fact that most of my family, and many of my friends have never read my books. This includes: my mother, my brother and sister, my wife’s sister, and two of our three children. In fact in our entire “direct” family only one daughter has read the books (and they were written to get her to read!)  So I always find it interesting when people see a bunch of high reviews and write that it must be “all friends and family posting.” 

The point of a review is to provide credibility. As I mentioned before you have to avoid even the appearance of impropriety so you should never artificially pad reviews.

------------------

So now that I’ve told you what you can’t do…how do you get reviews. There are many ways to do this:

**Goodreads**

Is a perfect site because it is easy to find people that should be perfect fits for your books and as such will review the book well. You should:

* Find a book that is similar to yours
* Go on goodreads and find people with high ranked reviews for that book
* PM them that you have a book like that which you think they may enjoy and that you'll give them a free copy with no strings attached...your ""hope"" is that they will like it enough to post a review but you don't ""expect"" anything
* Reassure them that you want ""honesty"" (actually getting some positive and negative reviews is generally better than all positive reviews as people find it more ""credible""

**Amazon**

Some of the top reviewers on Amazon list their email addresses (or websites where you can find their addresses) so they are easy to reach. These  people are voracious readers and as such they provide some good credibility. For instance Harriet Klausner (#1 Amazon reviewer) is often used in marketing materials, “A great read” – Harriet Klausner #1 Amazon reviewer. [You can find a list of top reviewers here]( http://www.amazon.com/review/hall-of-fame).  Also don’t rule out “the little guys” do the same thing that you do with goodreads. Find a book similar to yours and then look at the high ranked reviews and see if they post a website or email address.

**Bloggers**

I credit much of the success at getting the word out about my books to goodreads and bloggers. I actually [wrote a whole post on just how to “woo” reviewers so I’ll just repost it here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/sx440/how_to_get_book_bloggers_to_review_your_book/).

**Fans**

No one will speak more passionately about your books than a fan. They already love you and want nothing more than your success so why not help them help you.
Many fans post reviews, but to the vast majority it never occurs to them.  If you make a subtle nudge they jump to the occasion, “Of course, I’ll leave a review…I can’t believe I didn’t think of that myself,” they reply.

When I find a fan, I try to reach out personally and…
* Thank them for their support
* Ask them if I can write back when I have a new book out (permission based marketing – a whole topic in and of itself)
* And politely ask them to write a review if they haven’t already.  
I write each request personally, and modify it based on context – for instance if responding to an email. I never cut and paste but most of the requests sound something like this….

“Thank you so much for all your kind words, it really means a lot to me. If it’s not too much of an imposition, I would really appreciate it if you took a few minutes to post a comment or two on goodreads or Amazon about the book.  It doesn’t have to be a full out review, just a few sentences about what you liked (or didn’t…all I ask for is honesty) would really be a great help. There are many readers who won’t give a new author a try unless they see a fair amount of third-party validations so by doing this you might help to convince those on the fence to give the books a try.”

Anytime you find a new fan (on a forum, through email, by fanning you on goodreads) it’s common courtesy to thank them for their support. Also…when someone posts a nice review on goodreads, I might ask them to repost on Amazon.  

Don't get obnoxious about it, if they don't post a review don't go back and prod them for one. They are already a fan, don't risk that relationship for the sake of a review...some people just aren't comfortable doing so. Fans are to be cherished, never risk alienating them.

------

Well that’s about all I can think about on the subject of reviews. I hope it is of some help, and others will weigh in with their comments and things that have worked for them.

This is a really exciting time for our subreddit!  As some of you may have noticed, /r/fantasywriters  is nearing the 1,000 subscriber mark (edit: and has passed it since I originally posted this).  I've been delighted by the growth of this vibrant subreddit, and I'm grateful to all of you for making this such a great community over the past six months.  I'm proud of what our sub has grown into; in fact, we've grown so much as a community that the time has come to add another moderator to the team!

**On that note, please welcome your second mod, Pantsmcawesome!  Pants has been a committed, enthusiastic member of this subreddit from the beginning, and even designed our gorgeous logo and challenge champion flair.  I'm excited to have him on my team, and I know you guys will be, too!  Please use this thread to welcome him to this new position. :-D**

**What This Means For You:**

*As before, all submissions requesting critique will receive a response from at least one moderator.  Sometimes it will be me, and sometimes it will be Pants.*

When I created this subreddit, I decided that I would critique every submission that came in as a sort of guarantee that everyone who wanted it would get at least one solid, thoughtful response.  As the subreddit has grown, this has become less and less necessary; many of you provide incredible critiques on a regular basis.  It has also become more difficult for me to keep up with critiquing *everything* in a timely manner.  

I love reading, responding to, and upvoting r/fantasywriters' many excellent submissions **(Yes, I upvote every single one of your beautiful writing projects.)**, but I also have a spouse, a life, and a job.  Despite this, I'm not yet willing to give up my guarantee that every submission that asks for critique will receive a response from a moderator.  With Pants on the team, we can keep this promise.

**TL;DR - Pantsmcawesome is a mod, now!  Yay!  Shower him with congratulations!**

The pen may be mightier than the sword, but here we love them both.

As a longtime subscriber to [r/fantasy](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/) I noticed that an overwhelming number of contributors to that subreddit (myself included) seemed to be writing their own fantasy novels.  However, r/fantasy is geared toward discussion of the genre; if everyone submitted their rough drafts, writing resources, and character descriptions, these threads would clog up its front page!  Conversely, [r/writersgroup](http://www.reddit.com/r/writersgroup/) provides a place for writers to submit their questions, work, and resource finds, but doesn't have the fantasy bias for which I (and hopefully you) yearn.

With that in mind, I decided to create r/fantasywriters.  This subreddit is designed specifically for those of us who are writing our own fantasy series, novels, short stories, and even poems.  I envision it as a place where we can provide considerate peer review, help one another work through plot holes, and share our resources and inspirations.

I invite you all to write, ask for suggestions, and offer your own with kindness.  I look forward to building a community conducive to writing in my absolute favorite genre.

I absolutely abhor surprises. I don't take chances or do things without evaluating them. I overthink everything. And I used to write like that. I would plan out every single detail of a story and by the time I was done planning I no longer felt the need to write it because in a way it already felt complete.

1356546800.0,15,self.fantasywriters,15h7av,"It seems that it is the imperfect, not the perfect, character is the most likable. What sorts of flaws, short comings, and faults do you incorporate into your characters?",Fautlen,16,1,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/15h7av/it_seems_that_it_is_the_imperfect_not_the_perfect/,"I ask this because there seems to be a fine line between making a character too competent and dangerously stupid when giving them personality quirks and flaws. 

Make the flaws not very defining and you wind up creating a 'Mary Sue' who's short comings are so minuscule that if they weren't explicitly stated no one would know that they even existed. That or the flaw is present but isn't really a 'flaw' at all, just a minor annoyance.

An example would be Superman when he is written poorly. I know some  people out there swear by the Man of Steel, but I've never really cared for him. To me he's always been too perfect. Flight, super speed, heat vision, ice breath, super strength and damned near invulnerable. His weakness? Kryptonite, and outside of that Superman's pretty much untouchable. He's stronger than you, faster than you, and just better than you. As a result for me he's hard to relate to and comes across as flat, 2-dimensional boy scout.

However, if you swing the pendulum of  competency to far in the other direction you get a whiny mess of neurosis that is just as hard to like as a Mary Sue. My example of this mistake is the main protagonist of the anime Evagelion, Shinji Ikari. For those of you who don't care for Japanese animation I'll give you a brief summary. Shinji is the boy hero of this giant mecha show, however he is wrought with low-self esteem, self-hatred, doubt and some serious abandonment issues from his father who left him to go off and build giant cyborg-monster death machines. His dad calls him to come pilot one of the robots via blackmail and thus begins our hero's slow descent into insanity and depression as the stress of fighting horrible eldritch abominations wears on Shinji's mind. 

Now much like Superman, Shinji can be a hard character to relate to. However it is for a very different set of reasons. Shinji is a *very* flawed character, whereas Superman can  be seen as perfect (or at least very close to perfect). Shinji acts in ways in the narrative of Evangelion that are very counter productive. He refuses to pilot his mech, runs away from his responsibilities, and blatantly pines for for the approval of his father who by all accounts is a terrible human being. Yet most people do not like Shinji because he acts in ways people view as being 'wimpy' or like a 'pansy'. He is unlikable because his flaws seem to off set his perceived usefulness to the story.

So my question to /r/fantasywriters is how do you find the balance for your characters in terms of their faults and limitations? To me a truly interesting character is one who does have faults and flaws. Perfection is boring because there is no conflict with a perfect character. However, there does seem to be a threshold for how flawed a character can be before reader sympathy drys up. 

Going with that theme, what sorts of flaws and faults do you like to see in character or use with your own characters?

I completely disagree, but what do you think? Is profanity too jarring in fantasy fiction?

For those of you who would replace curse words with fictional swears, how do you manage to pack the original punch of a known curse word without sounding silly or childlike?

For any avid worldbuilders out there, do you take into account the societal attitudes towards sex (i.e. would ""fuck"" even sound harsh) or belief in an afterlife (damn, hell, etc) when choosing what curses to employ? How do you substitute in these situations?

1350523064.0,15,self.fantasywriters,11nx2r,On writing and killing and loving my novels.,smwhite,15,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/11nx2r/on_writing_and_killing_and_loving_my_novels/,"Over the last five years, I've written five novels (this does not indicate one year equaled one novel), and I’ve enjoyed every second of it. Yes, even the frustration, the depression, the self-abasement, and the lonely hours. Even those dreadful periods of staring at a blank page and realizing I have nothing significant to say. I loved it all. And here, for you, are some of my thoughts.

The first novel I wrote came in at 208,380 words. This was my golden child, whom I cherished and coddled and could see nothing wrong with. The child that grew fat because I denied her nothing. I would add chapters and characters and pages and pages, never cutting, never seeing fault. And she expanded, and her cheeks grew pudgy, and she waddled when she walked. That novel is shit.

My next two novels were a pair. Book 1 ""A Dream of Revenge"" and Book 2 ""A Debt of Revenge."" Their lengths: 104,943 and 83,928. These I did not seem to love as much as my first. I tore them apart, running through a combined twenty drafts in the process. I deleted entire chapters, cut blocks of prose and dialogue, removed characters, changed endings and beginnings. If ever a story went through surgery and came out a different beast, it was these. I even, in a moment of recklessness, merged the two books into one. It was not a pretty sight. And it might have been around this time that I heard the townsfolk gathering their torches and pitchforks… This, I feel, was the defining moment of my evolution toward becoming a writer. I learned not to be afraid, not to get so close with a project that it becomes untouchable. While I did love these books, I loved them in a different fashion. My first book, if it had been a child, would have been a spoiled little brat that would spit in other children's hair. And I would have seen no wrong in that. These books were more behaved, cleaner, smarter. These were books I could take out into public. Still, they weren’t THE books. I was proud of them (I was proud of my first as an accomplishment). But I was capable of creating something far superior.

Thus, my current series.

My current novel, the first book in a two book series (I do enjoy pairs), is polished and spit-shined and lovely. It is the child you put on stage because she is adorable, and she’s talented, and all the people ooh and aah when they see her. And she was a bitch to create. I’ll keep with the child metaphor here. This novel is like one of those miracle babies, the kind that appear only after years of drugs, and doctors, and hours in the bedroom, and artificial insemination. This was not some accident spawned in the backseat of my parent’s car because I bought a condom that was one size too big. No, this child was wanted, and intended, and an ordeal to bring into the world. And once she was born, she had all my attention, and all my hours. I took her to classes where she learned to sing and dance. We would read together and eat together, and I’d tuck her in at night. My adult voice came out at times, but it was in an effort to correct not to abuse. And when I got frustrated, I would step away. That’s how my darling came to be.

Her sister is still in training. Past the diapers stage, but not yet into the getting-dressed-on-her-own stage.

Honestly, writing is wonderful, and I cannot see myself living without it. It is transcribing a life tucked inside you, one that only you can see and hear, and doing it so that others can see it as clearly as you can. I have no lack of thanks and appreciation for the countless writers who have inspired me and moved me to the point of creating my own books. I owe them something beyond precious. I hope that, in time, my own stories with move others, and motivate them, and help them uncover the worlds waiting inside them.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_11nx2r,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/11nx2r/on_writing_and_killing_and_loving_my_novels/,
1348630726.0,15,self.fantasywriters,10hmsf,"Show Versus Tell, Explained and Opinionatored",jp_in_nj,16,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/10hmsf/show_versus_tell_explained_and_opinionatored/,"In a crit I did for a member this afternoon, I explained my take on Show versus Tell and the best (IMO) uses of each. This is an expanded version of that. I hope you find it useful!

------------

What is Show, and what is Tell, and why is one better than the other?

The short answer is that neither is better; each has their use. But I believe they should be used knowingly and to a purpose. Loosely, I define them as:

* *Show:* Information is presented to the reader in a way that requires the reader to contribute their own knowledge and interpretation. Showing asks the reader to take an active role in understanding the story. It says ""here is a hole; you know enough to fill it in, or you're smart enough to figure it out."" This tends to engage the reader's attention and makes them feel a part of the experience. Typically this is accomplished by demonstrating rather than explaining. 

* *Tell:* Information is provided to the reader with no engagement or analysis required.  Telling guides the reader to believe that they don't need to engage with whatever is being told; the storyteller will provide them everything they need to know about the thing. Typically this is accomplished by explaining rather than demonstrating.

Examples  (not great ones, but they'll do):

&gt; Caroline looked at her keys and sighed. Her car was somewhere in the lot, she was sure of it. But the thought of trying to find it was overwhelming. And even if she did, what was the point in driving all the way home? She fished out her cell, pressed the Messages button to replay Jo's final call yet again. The last message Jo had left to anyone. Her voice had been so small and distant and scared. Caroline knew how she felt. 

versus

&gt; Caroline was profoundly depressed. It had been a horrible day, and with Jo's death last week she couldn't even be glad it was over because she was going home to an empty house.


Telling isn't inherently bad; sometimes it's exactly what's needed. It's more compact, it's more precise, and leaves nothing to the imagination. When something must be known beyond question, Telling is often the right way to go. (This can be used to mislead the reader as well.)  IMO, Telling is best used when the information being transmitted is more important than the audience's engagement. 

Another use for Telling might be when the author can't expect the reader to have a basis for interpretation. If the author's writing about a crystalline life form from another planet, readers aren't going to know how the aliens interpret the world, so showing their reactions, for example, won't help. (It would breed mystery, though, which is always useful). Or, if the author is writing for an audience that isn't sophisticated enough to pick up nuance - e.g., primary-school readers, or low-education YA readers. That's another great use of Tell. 

Too much of this, though, and we may lose more experienced readers' engagement. Readers tend to want to be involved with the story, contributing ""their 50%."" By default, then, since I believe that we're best served by engaging the reader's attention and intellect the majority of the time, I believe that most of the time writers are best served soliciting the reader's participation, not spoon-feeding them information. Thus, in most cases, I find Showing to usually be the more appropriate mode.

Again, none of this is absolute. It's blendable, stackable, mish-mosh-mashable. We can use Telling to Show, for example. We can blend Telling and Showing in the same paragraph - sometimes even in the same sentence. A fantastic narrative voice can get away with Tell all day long and then some, because the narrative voice is engaging the reader. But it's always useful to consider -- in revisions if not in first draft -- the impact we want a particular scene/exchange/paragraph/sentence/fragment to have on the reader, and use the tools accordingly.

(I think this, by the way, is the primary reason that adverbs are frowned upon. Adverbs are the epitome of Tell, in that  they provide instructions for the reader on how to interpret what has gone before, and thus take the reader out of the experience.)

Okay, that's enough longwinded babble from me. What did I miss? Where am I wrong? Should I have gone to bed an hour ago? :)

**How the Chutkra came to the Crimson Isle**

The greatest of the Chutkra was Chut, and the wisest was his wife, Kra.   They lived to the west, on the mainland.  Chut was the first to build in stone, and he dammed the mother river, forming the great lodge lake.  Chut boasted of his great feat, saying “I am master of the waters, there are none I cannot tame.”

Coyote, who loves nothing more than to humble the proud and mock them, overheard this boasting.  He went to Chut and said “The mother river is nothing but a trickle of urine, your great lodge lake is a puddle of piss.  The least cub could have created them.”  Chut replied “What an insult!  You mock my abilities, but I will prove them to you. Bring me to any water and I will tame it, and you will pass across without even dampening your paws.  

Coyote replied “Very well, but if you fail I will take as a prize all the fish in the Great Lodge Lake.”

“And if I succeed?” said Chut.

“If you manage to succeed, then I will grant you a worthy prize.”

So Coyote took Chut and Kra to the ocean, and they began to build a greater dam than any ever seen.  They piled up rocks and dirt and logs, stretching out far into the ocean.  But Coyote snuck down beneath the waves and tickled the great whale that lies sleeping at the bottom of the sea.  The whale laughed and thrashed and spouted vapor, and a storm arose.  Chut and Kra were swept out to sea on a pile of logs.  They floated for a day and a night until they washed up on the shore of the Crimson Isle.  Chut was in a foul mood, saying “I thought I was the greatest, but Coyote has bested me.  This vast sea is too powerful to be dammed.”  But Kra looked at the pile of logs, thought to herself, and said “Do not despair, for if Coyote cannot be defeated by strength, perhaps he can be beaten by trickery.”

So Kra and Chut took the logs and joined them together tightly, making the first boat.  They swam behind it and pushed it off from the Crimson Isle back to the shore, where they found Coyote.  

“Coyote, come, and you will pass to the far shore” said Kra.

“I do not see any dam” said Coyote, “but I will come anyway”

So Chut and Kra pushed Coyote across the water on the boat, and Coyote stepped off on the far shore.  His paws were perfectly dry.  “Very interesting” he said, “But you have not dammed the waters.”

“Our wager was that you would cross with dry paws, and you did,” said Chut.  “Now give me the gift I have earned.”

Coyote laughed, for he knew he had been tricked.  And he fashioned a sail for the boat, saying “I give you the gift of the wind, so you do not have to push your boat everywhere yourself.” 

 And so the first boat was invented, and the first sail, but the wind has always been a fickle gift, sometimes helping and sometimes hindering.  And Chut and Kra lived for a time on the Crimson Isle, where some of their descendents remain to this day.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_vee8o,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/vee8o/critique_my_myth/,

The Table Theory of Characterization is simply that your characters need to be so fascinating and interesting that if your plot didn't exist, it would still be interesting to simply read about them sitting around a table, talking to each other. 

It comes out of TV, specifically Firefly, where the scenes around the dinner table were some of my favorite, showing the family-like nature of the crew. I would have loved to just watch them talk for 44 minutes. 

Keep in mind that while comedy and the characters being amusing is one useful trick to making this happen, it's not the only one. (Also keep in mind that different people have different senses of humour.) 12 Angry Men is a rather famous drama with the same concept. 

It doesn't work with every excellent story, of course, but I do think it's a good guideline, if not a rule. 

Novels are a different beast, of course, but it's still a good test. Could these characters be interesting without pressure and plot pushing them down? If not, how could you make them more interesting?",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,title,True,t3_nyerb,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/nyerb/the_table_theory_of_characterization/,

It is fantasy but set in the technology level of the 1900-1920's. 

 In the Green times, the animals numbered like the stars in the heavens. The great clean waters flowed and the land grew fat. The original people were brought to this lush land by Branglik the Wind God. They followed his voice from their homes across the ice and multiplied in great number. At first they worshipped Branglik and were good to the land and each other. However, in time the original people began to remember their old Gods from across the ice. Castiq, the Goddess of the Harvest, filled their minds.  The people shed their goodness and grew petty. Safety and plenty had soured their souls leaving only room for greed and malice. Castiq cared only for the offerings and urged her followers in their bloody pursuits. The original people lost their strength in a time of gluttony and slaughter. Branglik watched this with sorrow in his heart. He had led these people to a land of wealth and it shamed him to see their actions.  Branglik flew to the Mount of Ush’allin and prostrated himself before his father. Mestish, the God of Storms, listened to his son and his anger grew. Lightning flared and thunder rumbled like a thousand thousand drums. He called his daughter Ashanna, who was the shepherdess of the sun. The fiery beast had been yoked to furnish the land of wealth.  Ashanna heard her brother’s story and wept bitter tears. She bade her brother to return to the Green lands and offer the original people one more chance of peace. Meshtish assented to this out of love for his gentle daughter.  Branglik returned to the people but they did not remember him. They had no mind for the power of the Wind and Storm in the Green lands.  Malice and hate clouded their every action.  Meshtish gathered his strength before descending on the Green lands. In a blaze of blinding fury he drove the vile Castiq into the Southern wilds. His rage carved the very earth and the clean water flowed away. Ashanna let loose her beast and the heavenly fire burned the lushness from the land. Branglik battered towns into dust and scoured the herds of the people. After many days, when the vengeance of the Gods was abated, the Green lands shimmered with heat. Great sands covered the earth as far as the eye could see. Only the strongest of the original people survived the cataclysm. They would never again forget the Wind or the Storm.

[Google Doc, if you would rather read in that format.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xzwdl82gw3hnttZVX7BDkBpH2O8CJL3vTTQzZ9Pp-PY/edit)

One boy, two versions.  Two worlds.  Two lives.

When we dream, we experience a different world.  A different reality.  

What if when you were asleep, the other you was awake?  And when the other version of you is asleep, you are awake?

Patrick O’Reilly is a 16-year-old boy living in Oregon, United States, Earth.  He goes to school, plays sports, and has a job.  In every way he is an average kid.  Except, of course, for his severe Social Anxiety and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

Patrick O’Reilly is a 16-year-old boy living in Secant, Central Empire, Custos.  He goes hunting and gathering everyday, sells whatever his family can spare in his village’s trading center, and visits the Fire every night to hear the nomads tell stories of their travels.  In every way he is an average kid. 

Earth is a land of technology and focus; where we are trapped by the limits of reality.  Custos is a land of wonder and freedom; where anything is possible.

Every night, Earth Patrick hunts, fights animals only found in fables, and discovers spectacular impossibilities around every turn.  Every night, Custos Patrick dreams a life of simplicity, without the endless dragon attacks and the constant threat of death.

However, when Custos Patrick is listening to a nomad tell his stories one night, he hears tell of a door.  A door that leads to a parallel world.  Patrick initially wrote the story off as nonsense, but from then on both boys are beginning to remember their dreams more and more clearly.

As each Patrick becomes more aware of the other, both start to wonder.... Does the door the nomad spoke of actually exist?  If they went there, would they find the other version of themselves there?

Both Patricks here begin their quest to find the door to finding themselves.  To finding the universe of their dreams.

I could chalk it up to a learning experience and leave it in a drawer somewhere, but I love the story.

I'd like to start the revision process and see if it can't be polished into something halfway presentable. 

Problem is, I have no idea where to start. I tend to do things with a strategy or a plan in place beforehand, and I haven't seen a whole lot about the revision process of a novel. 

r/fantasywriting, how do you go about revising your work, especially pieces as long as a novel?

________________________________________

Behind him Captain Rheo knew the city was glowing red. The fires had spread to the city walls. Nowhere was safe. They raced on, climbing the Thousand Steps, littered with the dying and the dead. Rheo commanded the remainder of them not to halt the ascent. It was past sunset, but the sky was not lit with the stars. It was thick with smoke that was not grey but painted in hues of orange and yellow. The air around them was thick with ash, which danced across their faces. He could hear the clatter of steel on steel and the screams of soldiers fading as they grew closer to the Great Door. Out of the swelling clouds a military skyship plummeted to the ground almost in silence. 


At the top of the Thousand Steps stood a Guardian Knight of the Thrince Order. He supported himself on his sword. The amour on his left side layered with blood, his helm had been smashed inwards, his own blood seeping from under it. As they approached him he straightened himself wearily and raised the sword with both hands.


Rheo looked at the man and felt impatience swell in him. “Yield sir, you are not fit to fight.” But the Knight did not move. Rheo looked at the dying man, he too was ready to collapse. But they could easily get past him and through the colossal doorway.


Dyron whipped an arrow from his quiver and took aim, but Lethir placed a dark hand on the shoulder of the archer and whispered in his ear. Turning to Rheo he spoke “Leave the honourable sir to me.” The young Ma’hajia allowed a flicker of a smile to cross his face “I will catch up.”


Orta stepped forward and grunted in disgust “A knight deserves a clean end. No witchcraft. I will take him to his god.”


“There is no time for your Knight’s code now. I need you with me. In the temple, Lieutenant” Rheo turned to the dark-skinned youth “Make it clean, if you can.”Orta made a sound like braying horse and twisted his hands round the hilt of his greatsword. The three soldiers could wait no longer. They had to move forward, pressing on into the temple.


As they stepped into the corridor they slowed their pace, to let their eyes adjust to the lack of light. Rheo was the first to see him. He could not have been older than eight or nine. The child, his skinny body leant forwards, held himself ready to fly at his enemy. Two double-bladed knives curved ferociously from his small hands. The hood of his robe swallowed his face in shadow. 


“Remember he is no ordinary child, Captian.” Orta called from the great doorway. He was right, but the solider had little compassion. “He may look like a boy, but he has trained to fight like a wild thing.”


Captian Rheo felt an ache of sorrow for the child, but he did not take his eyes from the inside of the hood. With his sword drawn in one hand, he motioned with the other to his two remaining squad mates to hold back. He slowly moved forward. “Even wild things have their reasons to fight, Lieutenant.” 


“And we have our orders.” Orta said severely. 


The boy’s head twitched upward slightly, “Fools.” The light from the doorway revealed his small smile. “You cannot stop me.”


“I am not your enemy, little one” Rheo watched the child as he crept closer. 


The boy leaned back almost crouching. “You are in my path. You will step aside or fall like the others, brother.”  The voice seemed not to come from him at all, but somewhere else in the cavernous corridor. Rheo looked away from him for a second. Behind the boy into the shadows he noticed the intricacy of the carvings in the walls. As his eyes continued to adjust, the shadows fled and revealed black mounds covering  the floor. Rheo bowed his head in solemn sorrow as he realised they were the crumpled bodies of others trying to stop the boy and his kind.


 The boy whispered a blasphemy.


“Got quite the mouth on him.” Dyron spoke. Rheo heard the archer pull back the string of his bow.


The captain had become desperate to reach the boy that once was. “Do not shoot!” When he was within arm’s reach of the child he looked into the hood. A pale lilac reflection of light from his eyes stared back. “Come with us, we will keep you safe.”


Laughter came from all around them as if the boy were in the walls and floor and ceiling. The boy looked up and in one swift action pushed Rheo to the floor with inhuman strength. The captain’s hands were empty as they hit the floor, his sword clattering to the stone floor somewhere. He looked up at the boy who held a blade to his throat. “You are lost then.” The words came easy.  Rheo heard the twang of Dyron’s bow next. The arrow would have gone through the childs eye, but he was faster than a cat. His other blade deflected the arrow a finger-width from his face. Two more arrows followed and with the same triviality he defended against them. 


Orta was on him by the forth arrow, swinging his greatsword. The boy released Rheo and rolled out of Orta’s reach. Landing on his feet and thrusting himself forward into the fray, the boy leapt into the air and landed on the hilt of the greatsword. He climbed the giant lieutenant in two strides, spinning the great man around in confusion and rage. Orta reached for the sprite, but the boy laughed again. Orta threw the great sword to the floor and unsheathed his bastard sword. The boy now on his shoulders, slipped his knives gracefully under the lieutenant shoulder guards and cut the straps of Orta’s breastplate. The child then dismounted, sliding down his back, using him as a shield against Dyron’s arrows. Orta clumsily stumbled backwards appearing to dodge the projectiles, spitting angrily at the sinewy archer as he cursed. 


“Kill it!” Orta screamed at Dyron.


Dyrons retort came through rapid arrow fire. “Move out of my way then, you graceless shit!”  


Having given up on trying to find his sword, Rheo unsheathed a dagger and made a grab for the back of the boy. But he only got a hand full of robe. The child was quick to discard it. With one flick of a knife it was undone. Slipping out of it fluidly, he revealed a tangle of black, matted curls. Across his back he wore only a belt of long and short blades and small leather pouches. Under the belt a large tattoo of the Thrince Order covered his skinny frame. His baggy fisherman-cloth shorts barely reached his ankles. The child twisted his body and flipped over himself to the wall’s edge, rounded a pillar and vanished into the darkness.


For a moment the three became as still as the stones around them. Quickening footsteps came from here and then there, and then ended abruptly. Laughter came again and ended in a shriek. 


Dyron saw him first, a flash of bare flesh and filthy cotton. “Captain!” The archer pulled back his bow and released an arrow. 


Rheo threw himself down hard, rolled on to his back and saw the boy in mid-air coming down on top of him. He shuddered as the boy landed on his chest, hands and feet. Orta charged once again. The boy tugged a little pouch from his belt and plunged his fingers inside.


“Enough play.” The boy muttered staring into the captian’s eyes. The pouch released what seemed to be a liquid, which skittered up his arm unnaturally. As Orta’s sword swept down onto his neck but he did not flinch. He was motionless. He welcomed it, but the steel never touched him. For a moment Rheo thought the boy had turned himself to ice as he stood there shimmering. But as the blade cut into him, tiny crystals plumed out into clouds and swirled through the air. The steel, unhindered took the lieutenant with it through a veil of sand and hit the floor with a screech. The boy was gone.


Orta crumpled to the floor and Rheo’s view out of the grand doorway was unhindered. The city was still glowing red. He tried to get to his feet, but an agonising jolt shot through his chest. He clutched at it and found his fingers faltered, sending their own tiny pulses of pain through him. He looked down to see one of the double bladed knives embedded in his lower chest and his gloved fingers black with blood.
He looked up and out through the great doorway again. “Oh shit.”

Working on my first ever novel and I have a question about pacing. There's a lot that happens at the beginning of my story and, as it is currently, It's about 40,000 words in before my protagonists know who they are dealing with and what they need to do. 

My understanding of the three act structure (which I'm not really adhering to) is that act one ends when the protagonists accept the call to action, where they take the initiative, etc etc; they start moving the plot themselves instead of the plot being moved against them.

This seems like it might be relevant to this groups interests. I'm looking at relaunching a poll-based webcomic I worked on in 2012. Each installment ends with a poll where the readers vote on which installment happens next- a sort of crowdsourced choose-the-adventure story. I'm wanting to take it up a notch and assemble a small team of writers:

**Are you the kind of writer that walks away from every movie with a million different ideas for new stories? Do you have more ideas than you could ever hope to write down?**
 
If so, Dragon Pulp may be looking for you. I'm assembling a team of writers for cutting edge collaborative storytelling. As a member of the team, you'll write pitches for how the story will develop and the readers will vote for which pitch they like most. You'll be playing off of other equally creative minds and ultimately crafting a story that none of us could have written alone. It will be challenging- you'll have to think on your feet and make it up as you go along. It'll be loosely controlled chaos and seat-of-your-pants collaboration. It's not for everyone, but if it's for you- it's a rush. The polls mean constant reader feedback.
 
You'll be paid directly for your work and will also receive profit shares from any crowdfunding campaigns.
 
Writers will be selected for the core team based on what assets they can bring; diverse perspectives will be greatly appreciated. Previous experience with fantasy genre projects is preferred, but not required. Our schedule will be hectic, but laid back: if you're not able to contribute to any given installment, it's no biggie.

The two leaned on the door panting. The elf heard the slight ring of a bell and he looked up. 
It seemed that they had entered a shop. It was a large place that looked tiny only due to its large amount of contents. The mass amounts of tables and shelves were covered in everything from traditional herbs to strange vials filled with viscous fluids. The elf found himself eyeing a jar of eyes. He thought for a moment he saw one blink. He shivered.   
“Can I help you find anything,” said a croaky voice from above. A man on a ladder was arranging books. His liver spotted fingers slid down the spines as he whispered the titles to himself. “Ah yes, Exceptional Herbs and their Deceptional Cousins,” he whispered as he drew the book out. His straggly gray hair lay matted on the hood of his very long red robes; the elf swore he would trip on them in a matter of seconds. 

The old man stepped down the ladder and placed one of the books from the teetering stack in his arms on the front desk. He then peered down at the child over his round glasses and smiled broadly exposing his slightly crooked yellowing teeth. 

“No,” the child said almost too quickly. It looked anxiously to the window. “Unless you have something that can make us invisible,” the child muttered under its breath. The old man smiled again and then turned his head in the direction of the elf. 

“You!” He whispered, and the remaining books in his hands dropped to the floor. His smile had vanished.

“Me?” The elf said pointing at himself.

“I thought-“ the man began, “what are you doing here?” he asked.

“I’m sorry, I think you have me confused with someone else,” the elf said. He had no idea who this man was, let alone how he knew him. 

The old man turned his head back and forth between the elf and the child. He raised his furry eyebrows so high that the elf thought they might merge into his hairline. The commotion outside was growing louder, but the elf could still hear Raas’ deep roar over the crowd.

“Do you have a back way out of here?” The child asked anxiously, peering through the shelves. 

The old man nodded as he looked through the curtain out the window. “We haven’t much time,” he said closing the curtain back. The old man turned to the child this time. He bent over so that his face was in line with Cam’s, “did you or did you not come here through a crack?” he asked. His clouded brown eyes looked the child up and down from over his glasses.

“Thought as much,” the old man said getting up. He looked between the child and the elf once more, “next time someone asks you that, you better say ‘no’, understand?” He looked very seriously down at Cam, the little girl nodded her head. 

“Good,” the old man said retrieving his books and placing them on the closest table. “There is a back way, left at the tall stack of books, behind the old rune rug, see that it is unlocked,” he said to Cam. The child nodded and zoomed from where she stood through the shelves and was soon gone. 

The old man sighed and rubbed his glasses with the sleeve of his long robe. “I hoped to never see you again Firi,” the old man said, he walked towards the elf once more. “But it seems fate has brought us together once more,” he paused, “and who am I to question such a witty power?” ",,False,,t5_2t4ad,1372596975.0,,,True,t3_1hcaud,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1hcaud/just_finished_chapter_3_of_my_novel_and_this_is/,

----------------------------------------

He was suffocating. His throat constricted, refusing his attempts at air. Panic gripped him and he rolled onto his hands and knees. Fallen leaves squirmed beneath his palms. The earth was pulling him down.

His face was ashen, his eyes wide with terror. He screamed a long tortured wail and sharply inhaled. That at least gave him the breath his lungs so desperately craved.

Something dark had been behind him. Something had been in the trees. He cast bleary eyes in the direction he'd fled from but saw nothing. No, it wasn't something in the trees that had chased him. It was the trees. Murderous trunks full of malevolent life. They had raked his skin, torn his clothes and snared his legs with their vines.

But now as he watched he saw only trees that stood silent, motionless.

His furtive glances around him confirmed that the wood surrounded him on all sides. But directly before him, hunkered amid the leaf litter was an enormous granite boulder. Growing from its back was a single oak, its slender trunk smothered in dull green vines. Perched high on one of its branches an owl gazed down at him.

He struggled to kneel but his movements were awkward and clumsy. He felt like he was waking from the deepest sleep.

Trembling violently he looked back from where he'd fled. He couldnt go back that way, he wouldn't! Nothing would ever compel him to go back that way. His head spun, and he wiped away the trickles of tears that ran down his cheeks.

He laboured to breathe, to remember where he was. Why had he been running? And why was an oak growing from the top of a boulder?

He felt so confused and groggy. It was an oak, but the more he looked the more it wasn't. The owl had not ceased its baleful gaze but the oak was somehow different. Less oaklike and more...manlike. Would the very trees uproot themselves to become men and pursue him?

Why was that owl so intent on him!? He looked hard at the oak-man and where there were acorns there were now eyes. Eyes that scowled down at him. An oak-man with scornful eyes and all overgrown with vines that..fluttered.

This was ludicrously wrong. A fresh grip of fear threatened to strangle him. Falling backwards he tried to push himself away from the strange man of oak and the granite beast on which it crouched. But that way lead back to the trees. He cast his eye over his shoulder into the wood, and then back to the boulder.

Where a moment ago there was a man of oak there was now just a man. It wasn't vines that swathed his body but...a cloak! The man was wearing a cloak. But still the owl looked on.

""Help me"".

His voice croaked pitifully. He must have looked wretched and the owl offered him no sympathy. That bird was making him mad with its glaring. He glared back to show the ruddy beast how angry he was.

Only it wasn't an owl, just as the man wasn't an oak. It had feathers like a bird, and it perched like a bird, but now it wasn't even a bird.

It was a quiver, they were arrows!

Abruptly the spinning in his head became still and everything became clear.

It was a man kneeling on a rock that looked down at him. He was slender and clothed all in grey and green, and rising from his shoulder was a quiver of arrows feathered in grey. As he looked up at the man, who looked down at him, he again noticed the mans eyes. They were so bright, so silver, yet so cold and distant.

They were the eyes of a man no doubt. Just not the eyes of a human.

I've been in the self-publishing game for awhile, and am currently hoping to drum up a larger review base for one of my novels, *Twixt Heaven and Hell.* 

It's got some good reviews already, just not very many of them - so I thought I'd offer the book for free to a few folks who thought they might be interested in doing a review or maybe rating it on Goodreads. 

The book is high fantasy. Lots of magic, lots of fighting, a secret past, etc etc. You can find all the cover copy and of course read a sample at the Amazon page (linked below).

[Twixt Heaven and Hell on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Twixt-Heaven-and-Hell-ebook/dp/B008GOOQI4/)

Taste wise, I think that if you enjoyed books such as Brent Weeks' Night Angel trilogy or maybe any of David Dalglish's books, you might enjoy this.

Of course, your accepting a book in no way constitutes a promise to leave a good review, though I certainly hope that the people who respond to this will be doing it because they expect to enjoy the novel.

If you are interested, please send me an email at tristan.gregory.author[at]gmail.com, and let me know what format you would like the book in (pdf, mobi, epub, etc).

This one's puzzling me.

I'm working on a short story where the character arcs from point A to point D - not nearly all the way to Z; the story's too short for that, so I want to just hint at the beginnings of that arc.

Prior to the end, she's been bombarded with things that tell her that her worldview isn't working, but she persists.

At the end, as it stands now, someone else--not even a friend, just an employee--sacrifices his own life for her to escape her situation, as long as she promises to take care of his family. 

The end that I have in mind is her escaping to safety, looking back and watching him die, and realizing the cost of her worldview. Not making a change per se, but it's a moment where the armor cracks and she has to let the reality in.

I want the reader to leave the story on a slight upbeat - I want this to be a positive step for her. Obviously, though, it'll be mixed - the guy, who seems a decent sort, dies for her safety, and that's a downer. I can't make her swing too broad, though, or it won't play believably.

My question is - obviously without reading the story, and all else being equal - would you hate her for getting to safety and having her ""what have I done?"" moment from safety as the guy dies?

Are your evil characters always saying to themselves: ""Well it wasn't *evil,* or ""it was a necessary evil."" Is it purely in the eye of the beholder? Or do you write characters which are aware they are doing evil and just don't care. Is evil an inability to see other creatures as sentient, and to view them only as means?

The terms have such clear historical baggage that I can't help but reduce each new wizard to every other wizard I've ever known, pigeonholing him before I've even met him. Seeing any of these words makes the whole universe seems smaller and less distinct because instantly its first impression is not its own; foreign data floods in and steals mental real estate, distracting the reader.

I think we all understand the power of names simply by virtue of Tolkein's presence in our pantheon. We should consciously extend that into our *titles*. The name for our mage-equivalents should be world-specific, indicative of our world's character as a whole. It's an extra piece of imaginative effort, and for me it's been one of the hardest parts, but I think that our writing will be the better for it.

Sometimes, however, when he is lost for where to go next or in mortal danger he will catch a glimpse of the goddess that either guides his next move or allows him to narrowly escape death.


I heard from a friend who read the ""Inheritance Cycle"" that it is revealed toward the end that some sort of all seeing psychic dragon hive mind had been guiding the protagonist in a similar way. He described it as a cop-out to cover too much deus ex machina.


Now obviously this sort of thing can be done well or it can be done poorly; my question is how you personally view the technique. Do you think that in general this technique can be applied well or do you believe it is just an easy way for an author to write himself out of a corner?

It occurred to me that fantasy as a genre is beginning to come into its own and as such there is much more in the way of context in which writers can converse.

Two of the biggest ways that I have seen this work is the deconstruction of tropes and the deconstruction of world building.  For instance, one of the big questions that Brandon Sanderson asks in his writing is ""how can I make this different?""  The easiest example I can think of is ""what if the chosen one failed to save the world?"" in his Mistborn novels.

Then you also have the deconstruction of good vs. evil in all the gritty books that have come out recently.  I'm thinking specifically of Joe Abercrombie and George R.R. Martin.  In a genre that is known for having the good hero fighting the ultimate personification of evil, we now have a much more nuanced approach to the question of morality.

1363727849.0,12,self.fantasywriters,1ama83,"How to Create a Name: A (Quick) Guide 
(X-post from /r/writing)",,15,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1ama83/how_to_create_a_name_a_quick_guide_xpost_from/,"**Preface**

Hello all! I'm quite new to this subreddit, and am hoping to make this first post a valuable one to the community. 
This guide is meant to help the reader create names that correspond to the character, or just sound good/cute/nice/edgy/fantastical, etc. This guide is mostly aimed at newly fledged arrangers of words who would like some insight about names. I realize that these are mostly geared towards fantasy names, as that is my favorite genre, but it should also provide food for thought for authors of other genres.
 I shall do my best, but if I make a mistake, feel free to correct me on it. Thanks in advance for reading any of this. 
And yes, I am a tryhard.

**Realism**
(Is the name appropriate for your character?)
How do you make a name? Sure there are generators, processes, and other mechanical methods, but those, as often as not, will create a name that doesn't really fit the character. For example, do you think it would be realistic for a peasant to be named something like Andravegnon Drehalian? 
First of all, in ancient times, most peasants did not bother with last names, certainly not something as extravagant as the example's. 

But still, Andravegnon sounds more like the name of a member of the aristocracy. As a peasant, you would be working day and night, and wouldn't have time to appreciate a lengthy name. Also, your parents probably didn't have the imagination for a colossus of a name like that. However, a name like Jass, or Crick Tagger would be plausible. 

Parentage is very important in a name, actually. As an example: 

&gt;If you are writing fiction and you have a character, and you say her mom was a doctor and a dad was a lawyer, I highly doubt those people would have named their child Sunflower. This is an extreme example. However if your character was raised by a single mom on a hippy commune, don't call them Theodore. 


This may seem like an obvious example, but it should get you thinking about the circumstances surrounding both the name and the name-givers. This is, of course, a less relevant in stories set in recent times because of how many names there already are in existence. Stereotypes will be made, but that's what the reader of your story expects. And it saves you some trouble, as a character with a peculiar name will require an explanation, something that could detract from the main story.

**Shorter is Better (Sometimes)** 
(A personal opinion)
As a reader, I find that I much prefer shorter, simpler names to more elaborate ones. Instead of Mirandrainia, Mirandra, or Andra will suffice. Even removing parts of a name helps. Also take into account that word of mouth may change the name of a place (Wren's Town to Renton, etc). However, I can understand longer names. They can help emphasize the importance of a place, or illustrate the artistic or cultural style of a race. Or just generally look cool.

**Think About What Your Character Did/Does/Is Like**
(Kinda important)
When choosing a name, take your character's character, achievements, appearance, etc. into account. They can form titles, nicknames, or even the name itself. Killed a witch? Jemmy Witchslayer. Lost nearly half a hand? Emrys Three-Finger. Modern names are harder to predict, as, again, there are so many of them. **But** they can reflect character/hidden messages or implications, which still applies in modern times. 

**Uniqueness** 
(Maudie, Maulie, Maxwell. Wait, what?)
When naming characters, it is better to have their names begin with different letters. Why, you ask? Because it makes them easier to tell apart while reading. Most readers don't really read whole words, but skim over it. From there, they can learn what happens at a faster pace, without losing the meaning. 
So, if both Tom and Tim were arguing, wouldn't it be confusing discerning who had which opinion? Also, try to change up the lengths. Again, Tom and Tim are easy to confuse, but Tommy and Tim aren't. Basically, try to 
give characters names that can't be easily confused.

**Some Final Words**
(Thanks for reading this far!)
Whew, nearly 600 words later, here we are. As I said before, this guide is meant for less experienced writers, and goes over some basic ideas for creating names. Feel free to use your imagination to create names, as those are the most unique. However, for those looking for some inspiration and guidance, I give you this guide. Happy writing!

I think it's a good way to remind yourself of how far you've come, when you can see your old mistakes. And it's important to remember that there are successes in there as well.  

I have more than this, but I'll limit myself to three which were each written about 3 years apart (when I was fourteen, seventeen, and twenty.)

If you haven't finished novels, go for short stories. If you haven't finished short stories, go finish some now. 

**Elemental Dragons**--I handwrote this trilogy when I was probably about 13 or 14 and just getting into Forgotten Realms. 

*What I like*: The Chosen One who's supposed to slay four dragons (based off the elements, natch) totally gets eaten at the end of book 1. The dialogue between the elf noble and the assassin was pretty amusing at the time. 

*What I dislike*: Terrible plot. The bad guys had no reason to be in an evil dragon cult except that they were evil. The protagonists, in terrible protagonist form, didn't want anything except to go through said plot. 

**Redemption**--My first full-length computer-typed novel when I was 17. 

*What I like*: The plot was nothing to write home about, but at least it was a protagonist protagging--he decided to make a change in his life, and no longer be an assassin. This conflicted with what his mentor wanted. Also, my halfling swashbuckler was hilarious, though over the top. 

*What I dislike*: I couldn't think of what to do with a character near the beginning of the book, so I had him sacrifice himself. There was no in-character reason he'd do that. I'm still annoyed at myself over that one. Also, it was my first time creating my own world, and I think I just used two words over and over again for all the various parts of the setting. (Serenity Forest, Serenity River, Serenity Valley--and yes, this was years before Firefly.)

**Pilgrim**: I actually finished two very separate drafts of this novel (as in, I rewrote it from scratch) but we'll use the first draft as my example. 

*What I like*: It actually had a very cool high concept and fascinating world-building. It was the first time themes really started to appear in my work. Some parts of the plot were honestly really unexpected and interesting. 

*What I dislike*: The dialogue took a turn for the boring, as my lead was far too whiny. While the concept of the world was great, I never made it real for the readers with enough tactile sensation. Giant chunks of plot had nothing to do with other giant chunks of plot.

Does anyone else do anything like this?,thetaubadel,12,1,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/qew5a/i_write_an_encyclopaedia_of_facts_about_the/,"Sa’guri

The Sa'guri were originally a group of twelve to sixteen warring tribes, depending on the era being discussed. At about the same time as the early Varese kings came to prominence, so did the first Sa'guri dalani, or emperors. By banding together, the twelve tribes spread their influence across what is now considered the Sa'guri region, and a shared culture with a focus on martial prowess and conquer developed.

The original twelve to sixteen tribes were culturally diverse, but with a shared focus on warfare. This led to the early establishment of fortresses used by their chieftans. However, due to a shared belief that one must win their place in society by strength of arms, the actual populations of the Sa’guri cities lived outside of the walls of the city. Due to their vulnerability and the constant presence of attacks from other tribes, the cities were often ramshackle, temporary affairs, which could be rebuilt hastily after their destruction. This is a trend which resurfaced with the rise of the Alchemists, as the Black Alchemical Sect that rules the Sa’guri lands do not allow the citizenry within the walls of their fortresses.

Sa’guri are generally tall and lean, with dark hair and eyes. After the ancient joining of the tribes under the first dalani, their cultural diversity was blended, leading to a shared design to their clothing. Generally they wear light, comfortable clothing, often dyed in purples and browns. The men wear traditionally beaded vests called wasals, and the women often bind and cover their hair. They are also the first culture to bind their forearms with cloth to prevent loose sleeves from impeding their work, a practice that has spread to other cultures over time. Men are usually clean-shaven, but the danal and the priesthood grow beards, which are often long and beaded.

The Sa’guri tribes each originally worshipped their own gods, but following their joining, the gods were folded together to form the single deity Bra’tur, the Westbound Sun. A god of the sun and of war, he battles the four moons for control of the sky. Each day he is habitually slain, to rise again the next morning. This death and rebirth cycle is celebrated each summer solstice with feasting and ceremonial fights representing Sa’guri myths. It is also a habitual practice to worship classical Sa’guri heroes, as it is believed that anyone who can perform twelve great acts of valor before death will be raised to serve as Bra’tur’s own army against the moons and their stars. The priesthood practice ritual sacrifice of animals and, once a year, will travel to the eastern-most point of Sa’guri to sacrifice a young man and a young woman by tossing them from the steep cliffs there.

Sa’guri architecture, when it is permanent, is often made of the abundant white stone found in the Sa’guri plains, but is brightly painted with depictions of battles and mythological figures. Squared doors, tall pillars and reed-like carvings are commonly seen in Sa’guri fortresses. Sa’guri build large, low buildings, unlike the tall towers of their western cousins, the Dre’en. Sa’guri statuary often depicts bulls or yoked oxen, the symbol of Bra’tur. Arenas are common in Sa’guri cities, and are one of the few permanent public buildings. Bathhouses are also common on the eastern coast of Sa’guri lands. The most famous bathhouses are found in the southern city of Sa’duna. Sa’duna is often called the City of a Thousand Baths, and is fed by natural hotsprings nearby.

Sa’guri men have a tradition of fighting to the death. When a dispute cannot be resolved by diplomatic means, no court is called. Instead, the men strip naked and fight with poisoned blades. A single cut can be deadly. The survivor is awarded whatever the dispute was over. However, if both men die in a dispute over a physical possession, said possession is taken by the priesthood. The fight as an importance in the Sa’guri justice system, as it is said that during the fights, all men are equal, and Bra’tur alone decides their fate. No one man has the power to decide who lives and who dies. This is, of course, not the full truth, as no two men are equally matched in the fights, and some men will make their living off of them. These men often develop an immunity to the poison used on the poison used on the blades, giving them another unfair advatage.

Women are equally counted as possessions in Sa’guri culture, and have no right to their own life. They are considered “owned” by their father or applicable guardian until married, at which point they are “sold” to their husband. Men can be married to as many women as they can afford to keep. Sa’guri do not have dowries. In Sa’guri tradition, a suitor for a woman against other men. The highest bidder pays and is married to the woman. Another way of winning a bride is through force of arm. If a man kidnaps a woman and spends three days with her, they are considered married, even if she was already married. It is believed that a man who cannot defend his wife does not deserve one. If, however, the kidnapper is caught and killed by the woman’s owner, all of his wives are given to the one who killed him, or divided amongst those who did. If a man decides he no longer wishes a woman for his wife, he can sell her to the highest bidder.

The Sa’guri leader is a danal. Danali were originally great warriors who won their position from the previous danal by killing him. Now, however, the position is inherited from the danal’s father. The position no longer carries any power, as the Black Alchemists rule Sa’guri, place laws and collect taxes. However, the Blacks do support the danal, as he is often turned to by the citizenry as a source of divine word. Over time, the position of danal became a holy one, as he is believed to be an avatar of Bra’tur on earth, and leads the priesthood. With this in mind, the Black Alchemists let him live a life of luxury so that he can help sate the populace when the Alchemists do something the Sa’guri do not like.

Sa’guri lands (usually called Sa’guri, even though Sa’guri refers to the people and a more proper term is Sa’mori), is a peninsula in the Middling Sea. It shares a border with Dre’en, which lies along the Illswater River and the western coast of Lake Ka’vuri.

1326697634.0,12,self.fantasywriters,oj16u,I'm not sure if anyone has tried this before. A character development exercise.,Dart_the_Red,12,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/oj16u/im_not_sure_if_anyone_has_tried_this_before_a/,"Alright, so at 3AM yesterday, something got into me. I tend to do small writing things, scenes and what not, in between working on my current novel, so that I don't get side tracked by other ideas, keep my writing in practice, and keep a file of ideas. So what I ended up doing, was writing a single scene, over and over again, each time from a different character's perspective.
So, here's the exercise:

* Using 3-5 characters (2 is too few, more and you're asking for trouble, but it's fine - I used 4), create a scene.
* The characters must enter and leave the scene at different points, and interact with the others as they normally would
* Each character, if possible (so as not to ruin the scene), should be started before they interact with other characters
* Each exit should attempt to be further away in time from the overall scene so the last character ends the scene all together.
* Any dialogue between any characters must remain constant. No changing/adding more dialogue in another part.
* Third person is much easier than first when doing this

What this will do, is create an overlapping of story pieces that will tell the greater scene. However, to do it, you'll be really getting into your characters' heads, as they become the focus of the story. By the time I got to part 3, the scene was entirely different from how it started, yet nothing changed.

EDIT: It's a little different than what I listed for rules (on a second look) and I apologize for the poor writing. I was kind of tired when I wrote it. The world is from a game I play, and I'd been writing short pieces from time to time following my character Soren. This is the end of his recent adventure.

The net curtains of the farmhouse across the way are swelling and slackening against their open windows, unable to escape. They look like lungs trying to breathe. This place is like poison. Sedate, slow poison. I'm dying here.

Do you know how it feels to go cold turkey from citalopram, codeine and zopiclone all at the same time? It doesn't feel like dying, not yet. I'm only two days in. Every time I move it's electricity in my blood. Every time I turn my head into the wind it's the sound of tides.

I am the tide.

I am a goddess of the sea, out to shore and disorientated. I am the in-between place where sky and sea and land are all the same. I am dying and living, over and over.

My skin is fire, my blood is lightning. My brain is water, my eyes are the world. I am coming out of a dream that might kill me.

Should  I dive back under, pay the boatman, plug my ears again? Or was I always supposed to feel this way? I took the pills because they told me to, but what if the before was who I was supposed to be?

He never gives you more than you can handle, right? Isn't that the Word?

I can't write on the pills. I can't feel it right. It's dulled and far away. Isn't pain the price we pay to be writers? To feel it so very acutely, so hard and so painfully that we have to write it down or die?

What's the alternative? To listen to it - the idea, the precocious grain of genius - rush over and past us, never to be seen again? That's the worst. That's a thing you might die for. Missing it. Missing the moment.

Run, run. Even if you're dying, run. Grab your shreds of genius and nail them to your paper. And don't take the pills.

You'll lose yourself.

I have to endure the pain to get back to myself.

My story is broken and waving helplessly in the universe because people told me I wasn't normal. That I ought to be normal.

I am not normal. You are not normal. You are extraordinary. You are something they cannot understand.

I've basically just hit a bit of a wall, I feel kind of directionless. Every two days i suddenly think 'hey wait, maybe that character could be...' or 'maybe this should be about..'

The question is, i think, how do you know when your idea has legs? How do you know to carry on? 



EDIT:

Thank you for your replies, you've given me some awesome ideas for trying to keep the motivation going. I think I will still struggle with the whole 'is this actually just shit' thing, but i suppose everybody does? right? 

Just in case anybody wanted any context, the story idea is a kind of fantasy noir. It takes place in a large city with a relatively new immigrant underclass. A fantasy-styled PI has a case or two land on his desk in quick succession - a young child snatched, and a rich merchant's daughter going missing.
 
The young girl's parents are trying to keep it quiet, while the rich merchant believes his daughter has been taken by a semi-folklore serial-killer currently stalking the city streets, who just happens to be an immigrant. 

During the course of the story, tensions between the immigrants and the locals boil over, the two cases intertwine and an unpleasant side of the city's upper crust is revealed, leaving the PI, a stranger in both sides of the city, in the middle of it all.

So. My novel takes place on an island where an old tribe lives.  The tribe has to be very old, ie having lived on the island since beginning of humanity pretty much - they're supposed to be descendants of ancient creatures. 

The problem is that my main characters, who goes to visit this island, are English. And naturally, I will need them to communicate with the natives. But why would these native people speak English when they live on an island with pretty much no contact with the surrounding world?

The other plot threads are coming together nicely, but this is a problem I have not addressed at all in my novel, and if I don't it kinda crumbles. It doesn't have to be a real location or an existing tribe or anything, but I need it to make sense. I'd rather not have someone act as an interpreter, as that would require him or her to be present every time someone wants to talk, which would mess with my story.

One idea I've had is that the natives can communicate with all living things, because they are descendants of a creature that embodies the essence of Life - but they're not supposed to be aware of this fact until the end of my novel. And this idea seems like a bit of a stretch in the first place.

Any suggestions?

Just remember to take breaks every so often and not to spend too many hours battering a keyboard to death. You might win the first few rounds... but the keyboard will eventually fight back.

I have compromised motor skills which mean that I have to type very heavily in order to maintain any degree of accuracy. When I get excited about an idea or development the typing is positively thunderous. As a result I've damaged my right hand, potentially permanently. The left isn't going to get any better either.

I'm not looking for sympathy, this is a warning of sorts: if your hands get sore from spending hours at a time typing thousands of words, take a break. Brainstorm new ideas in your head if you're still feeling creative. Use dictation software or even pen and paper if the keyboard is tiring you out.

My name's Tracy Barnett, and I'm new to the world of fiction writing. I'm in the process of beginning my first novel (have the first half or so outlined), and am planning the Kickstarter that's going to fund it.

I got my start writing tabletop roleplaying games. I've freelanced a bit, and I've published two games of my own: [School Daze](http://www.sandandsteam.net/schooldaze), and [One Shot](http://www.sandandsteam.net/oneshot). I began working on my third game, Iron Edda, which blends Norse myth and mechs. It was in working with the setting for Iron Edda that I realized I needed a better handle on the particulars of the world. I needed to get it under my skin, to live it.

What better way then writing a novel set in the world?

The novel is going to be called Iron Edda: Sveidsdottir, and will follow the story of Sigurd, a warrior who chooses to bond her spirit with that of a dead giant in order to fight the dwarves and their giant constructs. The story will be told in the form of nine vignettes of 10-15k words, each focusing on Sigurd's interactions with other women as she learns truths about herself and the world she lives in. Sveid is one of the Valkyries. Sigurd and each of the women in the vignettes carries with them or reflects some aspect of the spirit of Sveid. 

I did a write-up of the story on the website for my company, [Sand &amp; Steam](http://www.sandandsteam.net/2013/04/20/iron-edda-sveidsdottir/).

1364244164.0,12,self.fantasywriters,1azv8f,Wanted to be a writer for more than 20 years and I've never really written anything. Why? ,emphryio,16,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1azv8f/wanted_to_be_a_writer_for_more_than_20_years_and/,"My newest idea is that the problem is that creativity is probably usually sparked by unhappiness. But to keep the fire going, to keep wanting to return to your idea day after day, there has to be something very positive there. Unfortunately if the main idea/thought came as a result of something you were unhappy about, then it's really tied into something probably quite negative. 

So much of fantasy is extremely dark. For some readers it's too much actually. They don't sense the hope and they quit reading. You have to sense that the hero ""has an ace up his(her) sleeve"". But I think this is just as true of the author. To come back to it day after day, the author needs to hold on to whatever is positive within it. 

Probably you can't just dump your characters into hell without having any idea how they're ever going to get out of it, while you spend months developing hell/dystopia. This is especially problematic for me as all my ideas end up in these extreme dystopias, where sentient creatures are bred for food and the women are treated like in Saudi Arabia, etcetera. 

I periodically try to figure out why I just can't do it. Why I can't write. I did compose and record about 140 songs/tracks of music in 3 years so it's not that I'm just lazy.

As /u/elquesogrande stated in his [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/156ml4/anne_lyle_ama_and_the_new_rfantasy_fantasy_writer/) earlier today,

&gt;It is a struggle for fantasy writers to post their works on /r/Fantasy due to self-posting reddiquette issues. Our community could use more content from writers...but writers who self-post are often downvoted into oblivion.

&gt;Working with the /r/fantasywriters community, we have set up a new Fantasy Writer of The Day designation that will kick off tomorrow (Friday). The goal is to have an official forum where writers can sign up to show off their works. If interested, /r/Fantasy members can learn more about a new writer as well.

&gt;FAQ: There will be a signup process after the holidays and we will feature a writer every 3-4 days. Must have at least one completed story that is available for sale or for free. (Author's choice) Not limited to /r/fantasywriters, though they will likely have first shot at signing up. Post will include approximately a chapter's worth of material from the novel.

**One of own, Ken Lim (a.k.a /u/blowing_chunks), will be kicking off the process tomorrow/later today (12/21/12), with [Exigent,](http://www.amazon.com/Exigent-The-Liaison-Initiative-ebook/dp/B006X5ZL8W/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356032906&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=ken+lim) a piece that he originally submitted as part of our very first monthly writing challenge!**

Since this is an initiative between the two subreddits, all of us at /r/fantasywriters  will get first dibs on sign ups.  Stay tuned for more info about that, and be sure to check out Ken's debut submission on r/fantasy!

The advice below isn't fantasy specifically, but it's VERY useful to think about, particularly if you haven't given it much thought before. It's voiced to screenwriters, but it's probably good for any writer to have in mind. Horses for courses, of course.

&gt; **John:** So, here are three sample sentences I read in bad scripts all the time.

&gt; * “There are four men in the room.”

&gt; * “A large suitcase is by the door.”

&gt; * “The fire is intense.”

&gt; So, those sentences, there’s nothing actually grammatically wrong with those sentences. They’re fine sentences. But they’re incredibly boring sentences. And the reason why they’re boring sentences is you are using to “to be” just to sort of state the existence of something rather than having the thing you’re causing to exist actually do something.

&gt; **Craig:** I have to tell you. It never crystallized for me why that was so annoying because I’ve read that very kind of clumsy, robotic sort of description before. And by the way, I’m not a huge fan of florid description or a lot of purple prose. But was it — the suitcase is what?

&gt; **John:** “A large suitcase is by the floor.”

&gt; **Craig:** Yeah, I mean shouldn’t the suitcase be leaning against the door? [laughs] Should the suitcase, “A large suitcase has been left by the door.”

&gt; **John:** Or better yet, rather than having the thing already be there, why don’t you have somebody put it there? Or why don’t you have your hero clock it or have your hero do something to it?

&gt; **Craig:** Yeah, that’s like, because if the suitcase was left behind by somebody, let’s say, and you’re a detective and you walk in the room, somebody should say, “Take a look,” you know, “he looks over a suitcase toppled...by the door as if somebody had left in a hurry.”

&gt; **John:** A big problem with “A large suitcase is by the door” is like well what is the shot here? Are we cutting away from our characters to show that suitcase by the door?

&gt; **Craig:** Right. Do you know what the shot is? It’s a 20mm lens way, way back like a stage. [laughs] And the room is empty. And it’s just a suitcase. And a door.

So I now submit mine:",Eladar,15,3,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/zzbbc/apparently_today_is_critique_my_magic_system_day/,"Magic in the book I have just started is based on a system of warcrys. Mages primarily use them in battle, although cries can be used throughout every day life to make tasks simpler or to aid the user.

The system is so simple that even babies can accidently use it, this is generally how it is found out that people have the ability. Genetics don't really come into it, and it seems luck and chance as to who gains the power (it's a lot more in depth than that, but going into too much will take away a lot from the story).

The cry differs in length/pitch/volume etc. depending on the power of the user, the power of the spell and what spell is being cast.
Using a cry tires out the caster and they must rest afterwards. The more powerful the spell, the more it drains from the caster, and they must rest for long periods of time. This means after some particularly powerful spells/battles, it can leave even experienced mages unconcious for days or even weeks. In this state, they are as ""mutes"" (Non-magic people).

Like most exerting activities, the body can be trained for it. As a runner gets less and less tired doing the same distance the more he has practiced, so the casters can train themselves to deal with spells. An experienced caster can use a cry that may have exhausted as a novice, but feel little more than a slight tiredness.

Some of the minor spells, or in special cases more advanced spells by experienced casters, can be whispered out rather than shouted, but the effect is diminished accordingly.

Limitations: Well, this is a question people ask a lot. A major limitation is that the user MUST be able to speak in order to cast. (One of the ancient punishments of casters from both the mutes and the magic communities are to cut out their tongues.)

Another limitation is how much it tires them out. Sure, a caster may be able to do incredible and unbelievable things for a few seconds, but it must be weighed up against the fact they will then be unconcious or weakend for a time afterwards when they are extremely vulnerable.

Also, depending on the confidence/bravery in certain situations etc. of the caster, it has been known to affect the pitch of their shout, and a different spell has been cast. This is sometimes, but definitely not always, beneficial.

Theres a fair bit more, but this is the very basics of the system. I will be happy to try and answer any and all questions on it. It may even help me patch some holes in the system I don't yet see.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_zzbbc,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/zzbbc/apparently_today_is_critique_my_magic_system_day/,

If anyone is interested I can give the gist of what I'm working on and they can do the same.

Over the past few days, I've begun to re-write the book, and Im enjoying every minute of it! edditing plot holes, elaborating on scenery, I've only done the first couple chapters, but I was wondering if any of you could offer any advice, tips, or help to an aspiring author :).

Also on a sidenote, I apologize in advance for any grammatical errors or proper book formatting, I've got another 70 or so chapters to go.

I'm very new to all of this, and this subreddit.

This is far and away the most *inspirational* on-writing book I know of, even if it's actual advice is pretty thin. It's a short book, but once you're finished, you just want to slam it down and write the hell out of some words. 

* On Writing by Stephen King

Like Bradbury's, I find this to be more inspirational/aspirational. Take the actual writing advice with a grain of salt; what worked for King might not work for you. (Some folk need outlines. Some folk like adverbs.) The thought processes behind his different works was incredible, and I wish there had been more focus on it. (There was a lot. I just want *more.*)

* The Art of Fiction by John Gardner

This is hands-down the *best* writing book I have ever read. It avoids the obvious problems of 'make interesting characters' and 'have a coherent plot', assuming you already *know* that. Instead, it focuses on thornier issues of subtext, thematics, and various ways you can achieve the affect you're going for. 

* Booklife by Jeff VanderMeer

This one excels primarily as a business book for writers, detailing the different ways you can market yourself, get an agent, and all that. It's more useful if you've already got a novel or a series of short stories you want to promote.

As before, the winner of this month's challenge will receive special ""challenge champion"" flair for the month following his/her win. For instance, if you win this month's challenge, you'll have challenge champion flair for all of September.

**Your Challenge:**  As writers, we all need to be able to consider different ideas and possibilities in our works.  We need to think about the choices our characters make and what consequences those may have. In 2,000 words or less, write a fantasy piece that explores this concept by having *two separate versions, and therefore two separate endings.*  **Note that each ""version"" of your story can be no longer than 2,000 words, however the entire submission can exceed 2,000.** Neither of them need be the ""right"" ending; we are simply exploring what-ifs, as in ""what happens when my character makes this choice instead of that one?"" or ""is this the real sword or the fake sword?"", etc.  The point at which the stories diverge is up to you as a writer to determine.  If you are confused, please see [my additional, explanatory post here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1ken8m/august_2013_monthly_writing_challenge/cbof84j)

On August 28, we will post a submission thread, where competitors can post links to their entries. Downvotes will be disabled in this thread and voters will be encouraged to upvote only one story. We will also be looking at the votes on RES, so even if someone's piece gets downvoted, we will only count the upvotes in final scores. Whichever story has the most upvotes by September 1 will be declared the August challenge champion. We look forward to seeing what this challenge inspires.

Happy writing!

This month: **consider the story you predominantly write - whether it be a novel, or a short story or just a universe of characters and such.

**THE PROMPT**
&gt; Write a story about an anti-hero. It need not be from the *perspective* of said anti-hero, but it must be *about* them. Remember that an anti-hero must be sympathetic to the audience!

**Submission Guidelines**

* Maximum submission length: 1,200 words. Bonus points if you keep it to 1,000.
* Submissions must be in the form of a Google doc.
* You *must* submit to the call for submissions thread on /r/shutupandwrite, otherwise voting's going to be a headache for everyone involved.
* Submissions are due by MIDNIGHT EST, Sunday, June 23rd.

**Voting guidelines**

We will be reading a maximum of six responses to this prompt, and to help us decide which ones get on the show, we're asking you to vote for the submissions you think would be the most interesting to hear. How you define ""interesting"" is up to you, of course :)

If we do end up getting more than six submissions, we will announce which six we will be doing sometime the following week on /r/shutupandwrite. The rest of the submissions are then ""up for grabs""; anyone is free to respond to them with their *own* audio critiques. If an audio critique is done well enough we may include it as a guest episode!

The axe damn near opened my throat right up as it went sailing past my face, swung by some possessed mad man, shouting the same insanity as the rest of our assailants. Only a quick backstep saved my life. He tried to swing the axe back the other way, going for my face again, but this time I brought my shield arm up and slammed the rounded wood straight into his wrist, knocking the axe flying away and no doubt shattering the unarmoured fool’s wrist. Before he had time to recoil from his disarming, I brought my dagger up and slammed it straight into his gut. I pulled it out and stabbed him again, leaving the dagger in as I knocked him to the ground with my shield, leaving him to bleed out as I looked around me.   

My travelling companions were locked in fierce battle with the group of lunatics and, while we were outnumbered, unarmoured, untrained mad men would rarely win in a fight against fully armoured soldiers. Another charged at me, wielding a thick tree branch like a club. He was a tall, bulky man and I knew before I felt my shield splinter at he had a lot of strength to him. It was easy enough to block his attack, though the force of it tested my sturdiness, after which, driving my sword into his chest ended the fight as quickly as it started. A third charged at me; this crazed idiot had no weapon other than a rock clenched in his hand. A threw my splintered shield to the ground and took my sword in both hands, swinging it down. It cleaved straight into his neck, carving down into his chest. He dropped the rock.

Here's my synopsis... 

*Agis Merovingian, crown prince of the kingdom of Joon tries to unite his people in the face of a conquering, prophesy fueled Empire by joining Bahvaria's two strongest kingdoms in marriage.    

Mari Argoth, the cold, spoiled, intelligent daughter of the King of Kesh, has been promised to the oldest son of the Eastern Star, Emperor of the Zenallian Empire and scion of the Avendi prophecy, to protect her kingdom, but a young prince has arrived in Kesh with the hope of a marriage that will doom all of Bahvaria to a bloody war they can't hope to win.  

Errol Visigoth, Viscount of the kingdom of Kesh, and secret agent of the Empire, desperately works to thwart the Prince of the Morning's marriage proposal through the use of ancient and forbidden blood magik.

A wondering drifter finds a moment of contentment in the Bahvarian city of Joon until he is unwittingly wrapped up in a plot to overthrow its ruling class.       

The Captain of the Emperor's personal Honor Guard, a ruthless and feared inquisitor known as 'The Knife', has left a trail of enemies in his mad struggle to keep hold of power, but his newest enemy is the empire's most powerful Assassins Guild, the Pushers. 

Two Deep Lords arrive in Zenallian to meet with the Emperor.  Their message:  The Deep is rising, powerful elemental magik is coming back into the world. The Avendi prophesy is manifesting.  All must be united under your rule if man is to survive the awakening of our oldest enemy...*

So far, I've adhered to it and written but still feel like my writing is rough. Therefore, since I'd like my novel to be in a little better of shape, I've put it down for a bit and am writing short stories (sort of like episodes, more or less) for practice to improve my writing. I've always been a huge fan of momentum and I realize that this disrupts it, but I've hit a minor wall or two and have done more editing on it than actual writing. 

I have written out the first one on a blog I had just put up. Would it be alright to post the link to the blog? I don't want it to feel like I'm just here for getting page views, but I believe if I'm pressured to put out a product every Wednesday (which is my plan) I'll be more...disciplined.

From the corner of her eye Sky saw the boy struggle, and she froze, not daring to look at him, hoping she was seeing things. It was only the dark playing tricks on her. The boy was dead, like the rest of his family, all five of them laid out in a neat row on the kitchen floor.
 
Heavy footsteps thudded across the ceiling as the rest of the clean-up team arranged the home to make it look like the family had left in a hurry. The clerk back at the guildhouse had already forged one-way ticket stubs for the portal to some dead-end village as far from the city of Drien as one could get.
 
She glanced down at the wet ink of the disintegration spell-form she’d drawn on the tiles. It was the worst part of the job, waiting next to a corpse for aerium infused ink to dry, the only light coming from whatever filtered in the windows from the street lanterns.
 
Another frail movement caught her attention, but this time she couldn’t ignore it. She crossed her arms and frowned at the boy. A knot of blood and crusty scab covered his shirt. Jed must have missed the heart by a hair’s breadth. He probably didn’t even know.
 
She knew she should kill the boy. That was her job, after all. Cleaning up the mess caused by an assassination. Any good cleaner wouldn’t even blink at the thought of finishing off a mark. She drew her dagger from her belt, and grimaced at the way the leather-wrapped hilt pressed into her palm and fingers. It fit its scabbard so much better. With a sigh, she put it back there.

Taking in a deep breath, she placed one hand under the boy’s knees and the other along his back. Her heart fluttered. She didn’t want to think what would happen to her if even a whisper of this got back to the guild. And what about Jed? Technically the failure was his. And as his cleaner, but more specifically his sister, she should tell him. But she couldn’t.
 
The boy weighed next to nothing. She lifted him from the ground, then took a furtive look down the corridor. Everyone was still upstairs. Good. Huffing a little, she carried him out the back door and turned onto the service alley behind the house. 

His arms and legs thrashed about, hands seeking anything he could grab onto. Sky held him tighter.
 
“Mam. Da,” he said, a mere croak that would have been swallowed up by city noise at any other time of day.
 
Sky gritted her teeth. Don’t listen to him. He’s a corpse. Probably be dead by morning.
 
Tall mansions overshadowed the laneway, all dark yards and shut up service entrances. She turned into an alley, smaller than the one they’d left, scanning the dirty walls for blankets or boxes or other evidence of street-sleepers. There. At the end of this lane. She made her way over to them and laid the boy on the cool stone, beside a man who huddled into his blanket and snored lightly.
 
“For what it’s worth, fare well,” she whispered.
 
He stared at her as she backed away, and his gaze seemed to pierce through to her soul. A shudder moved from the back of her neck right down to her knees. The illicit power deep within her reared up, ready to strike should the boy try anything, but she grabbed it tight and forced it back down. A dying boy, no matter how disturbing his stare, was no threat to her and certainly not worth releasing the awful magic within her.
 
Once she rounded the corner, she sprinted back to the house. She slowed as she reached the doorway, taking deep breaths to keep her fear at bay. What had she done? The guild would kill her if they found out. But how could they? The only other person who knew was the boy himself, and he’d probably die by morning anyway.

Oh Lady Fate, what sort of monster left a child to die a slow death on the cold stones of the street rather than granting him a swift painless end? She’d thought she’d done the right thing, but now she wasn’t so certain.

Basically I've had a story idea running around my head for awhile now.  It features a simple farming family living on the edges of civilization.  The parents are getting along in years and concerned about their children etc.  The oldest, a big man with a heart of gold and about as much brainpower.  The middle one, a wizard with some talent but little discipline, spends more time worrying about his family then himself.  The youngest an idyllic young woman who never really bonded with people outside the family, spends most of her days talking to the farm animals and the odd inanimate object.  Then one day some slavers show up and drag the youngest off.  The middle one takes what little magic knowledge he has and what little money the family had saved and chases after them, the oldest follows despite being told repeatedly to go home.  Without actually having to write the whole story out the older brother dies on the journey, and after the better part of a decade the middle brother finally rescues his sister who had spent the last years of her life being brutalized, (and her child)  they finally get home and their parents had died a few winters ago in a blizzard.  No happy ending, everybody is either dead or broken mentally, hell the bad guys may not even get what's coming to them.  Do people want a nice happy ending with their fantasy stories or would one with a sad ending be a nice change of pace?

* I've pared back how much of the dark elf's personality I reveal, but since there's more of him in the scene that follows this one, I want to establish his appearance and define just what a ""dokkalfr"" is.
* In the same vein of not revealing too much too quickly, I did not expand upon what, exactly, Emil and his brethren at the temple were doing.  This is also expanded upon in the following scene and more in the proceeding chapters, and the ""what?"" is part of the early plot driver.
* I haven't included the second scene because it is in the process of being attended to with a verbal machete wielded by Yours Truly.  Once deforestation is complete, I'll plant more trees and either append to this critique request or start a new thread.

This isn't ALL of the first chapter. 

Iphis flung his pack to the ground signaling to his companions that he needed to break again. He perched himself against an old, giant blackwood. The enormous tree gave him much needed shade. He signaled to his servant to bring him his pack. Thirst was on his tounge.

""And be quick about it!"" Iphis snapped. He had little patience for his newly hired assistant. She was too old, and rigid. Nor could she speak the Western Tounge. It was his mothers idea. Iphis had always known his mother spoiled him, everyone did. She was afraid of Iphis being sent out into Sidel Forest without tender care, so she had hired an extracted caregiver from the Southern Gens, Malwabai, to aid Iphis on his journey. Teza was her name. Dark skin and hair, she was slightly hunched in the back, and smelt of pepper and garlic. Her skin naturally warm, but she wasn't accustomed to the Autumn chill that had taken most of Sidel of late. She covered herself in thick dark fabrics, layer after layer, to keep warm. Iphis half thought she resembled the mischievous crows from his grandmothers old stories that she told him, as a child, before he went to sleep at night. 

Teza unzipped Iphis's pack and from it, she grabbed a canteen filled with water, and brought it to him. Iphis snatched the canteen in a hurry, gulping the water hard and quick. In doing so, he began to choke. Teza bent down to pat Iphis on the back, to help the water along, he started to cough as his other two companions began to laugh.

""It...isn't....funny!"" Iphis yelled at them, in between bouts of coughs, Iphis, motioned for Teza to stop patting his back, and to take the canteen away.

""I don't mean to laugh, cousin"" said Allison Dennizian, Iphis's younger cousin. She had taken to a pile of leaves, that had fallen from a deciduous tree. She laid horizontally on top of them, her head rested on her snatchel, staring up at the forest sky. Allison was the same height as Iphis. She had his red hue. Ginger hair, that had once been long as a horse's mane, now brunette and shoulder lengthed. She shared Iphis's pale skin, and freckled face. Iphis wan't as svelte though, nor as agile, but any passing stranger could have sworn they shared the same womb.

Iphis looked at her with contempt. This was her enviroment, Iphis thought. His cousin had always been keen to the outdoors. Always chasing after stray pets in the Royal Gardens, or hiking with her father and uncle in the Strawberry Mountians. Iphis was always jealous of her athelticism. How a girl younger and more roboust than I, could better me, shame me, at the wide outdoors! A humiliating thought that Iphis had always kept to himself.

It wasn't enough that the old crow his mother had hired to care for him could out pace him, but a flighty girl, who wasn't fully educated, and a year his junior, had taken the role of leader on this expedition that Iphis saw himself on. This had to be embarrassing for Allison's older sister, Max, as well, thought Iphis. To be lead by her younger? The horror!

Iphis looked upon his other cousin. Max was as diminutive and emaciated as all Easterners were rumored to be. She sat in the sun away from the shade of the giant blackwood, curled up, holding her legs next to her breast. She was cold, Iphis could tell. 

Iphis was fond of Max. He could relate to her more. She was quiet, and complained little. She sat staring ahead, looking out past what couldn't be seen, her mind was elsewhere. On home, thought Iphis. 

A gust of wind had blown the black hood from atop Max's head. Max didn't bother to fetch it. A brief smile appeared across Iphis's face. Max had been trying to hide her newly shortened black hair from Allison and him since they had set off, 3 nights ago. It seemed she no longer cared what anyone thought of it. It was her fathers idea. To have both his daughters alter their appearance before leaving. Max had never been particularly handsome. She was guant in the face, flat chested, her tan complexion had always contrasted with the typcially bright colored fabrics of the Sidel people. She had taken to black, something her deceased mother did not take kindly too. Black suited her, Iphis thought. And here she sat before him dressed in all black to match her newly shortened dark hair.

Dear Agent,

I am SO glad I was able to pitch to you. Thanks for the opportunity. You were fantastic. I hope you'll love my story.

Homunculus and the Cat is about alchemically made, artificial humans who, in the traditional sense can’t die and a magical cat who can, nine times. It is the story of the intelligent, color-changing, winged, magical cat, a human named Tyro, several homunculi and their collective deaths.


The refugees at a homunculus sanctuary in Atlantis are vying for equality, but the Japanese mafia, from whose tyranny they escaped, don't want to give them their freedom so easily. Funding is limited at the sanctuary, especially after the fire, and the makeshift family will accept any help they can get, so long as it doesn't mean going back to the Yakuza. They would rather face the entire Persian navy. An angry clan of mermaids with giant armored battle squids? Sure. Tempt the wrath of the gods? No problem. Anything to gain global recognition of their independence.

The book is just under 70,000 words and targeted toward an early adult audience. The main protagonist, the cat, is about eight weeks old, but Tyro, the other main character is in his early twenties. He's from the ""real world,"" but this is not the story of how he crossed over into the world of myth. It is the story of how he finally finds a cause worth fighting for, love worth dying for and the best sushi joint on the planet.

Homunculus and the Cat is the second novel I have written in the series but it is entirely a standalone work. I plan on rewriting its predecessor, Pantheon, to match the unique style that was developed for Homunculus and the Cat. I hope to continue that story with three to four sequels and at least one other standalone novel. I am currently working on a separate project however before returning to this series; a decidedly ""punk"" novel with a definite adult audience. I hope to have that book finished by this summer, at which time I will return to the world of Homunculus and the Cat for the extension of that series.

I have taught writing as a tutor at the University of Utah for over three years and study the craft as often as chance allows. I see no other future for myself than a full time writing career, primarily writing in the various fantasy and sci-fi genres.

Enclosed, as requested, is the first 40 pages of Homunculus and the Cat. I hope you enjoy them and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Homunculus and the Cat is about alchemically made, artificial humans who, in the traditional sense can’t die and a magical cat who can, nine times. It is also about their human friend Tyro, and how he, with the cat, gets caught up in their cause to achieve globally recognized independence and in doing so, their multiple collective deaths. The various mafias, specifically the Yakuza, who own most of the world’s homunculi, are provoked by the movement. They have released Shikome, Japanese demons to reclaim their lost labor force.

The refugees at the homunculus sanctuary in Atlantis may be vying for equality, but that doesn’t mean they prove that they are fully sentient and capable of human cognition. Funding is limited at the sanctuary, especially after the fire, and the makeshift family will accept any help they can get, so long as it doesn't mean going back to the Yakuza. Tyro and the cat have never cared about anything so much in their lives but they aren’t homunculi.

They face the entire Persian navy, an angry clan of mermaids with giant armored battle squids, and even tempt the wrath of the gods, just to prove to the world that it doesn’t matter what you are made of, but what you make with it.

This is ganked from another post I made. I think it'd be a fun challenge and discussion, so, here's a little game to play.

Have a look at the below one-sentence excerpts. Three of them are from published stories, and three from stories posted on blogs by non-professional writers. 

1. [Character name] sheepishly put down the milk jug and picked up the teapot, pouring the hot brown liquid in to one of the bone china teacups followed by a splash of milk.

1. There's litter lying on the streets and even the Christmas tree outside the library looks forlorn.

1. It was as if the last thirty-six hours had never happened, as if the last three years had not happened, as if his life had evaporated into the daydream of a small child, riding the carousel in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, on his first trip back to the States, a marathon journey by ship and by car, his mother standing there, watching him proudly, and himself sucking his melted Popsicle, holding on tightly, hoping that the music would never stop, the carousel would never slow, the ride would never end.

1. The other passengers were much cleaner than me too, didn’t have any traces of grease on their expensive jumpsuits, didn’t stink of manual labor, which they seemed to think gave them the right to look down their noses at me.

1. Instead of running through city streets firing military weapons, an observer walked city streets watching pigeons; it had occurred to someone that city birds were feathered lab rats in regard to climate change, air pollution, noise, population density, food acceptance, all sorts of things that humans might face as resources dwindled.

1. He was a tall man, well built, and if we had seen him walking around Piter in street clothes, we would have known him at once for an infiltrator--he had the body of a man who ate meat every day.

First, which 3 were written by professional writers, and which by amateurs?

What about the pro samples separates them from the amateur samples, in your mind? How could you tell just by looking at them?

------------------

Answers

I have to say, I was surprised by the confusion in these results. For me, there was only one item I wasn't sure about, and I leaned ""Pro"" for that item. All the others, the ""pro"" ones read professionally, and the ""amateur"" ones read amateurishly. I think there's probably something to learn from that, but I'm not sure what.

Here're the results, and my read on them. I shan't name the amateurs, because even though the stories were posted publicly, that still wouldn't feel right. 

1. [Character name] sheepishly put down the milk jug and picked up the teapot, pouring the hot brown liquid in to one of the bone china teacups followed by a splash of milk.

  **Amateur**. 9/12 people got this right.

  What gave it away for me (if I didn't pick it myself) would have been the great attention paid to the detail - a pro, I think, would have stopped after ""...picked up the teapot"", because if the character wasn't going to bash someone's head in with the pot, s/he was going to pour tea. Since that action is a given, there's no reason to show it. If the china was important, it could have been shown in the transaction between tea-pourer and recipient.

1. There's litter lying on the streets and even the Christmas tree outside the library looks forlorn.

  **Pro**That's Jo Walton, from *Among Others*. 9/12 right

  What makes me come down as ""pro"" on this is the very thing that someone thought wrong - the forlorn tree. It's a type of thing that amateurs often don't think to do, and when it is done its done sloppily. I can see why some thought it amateur, though.

1. It was as if the last thirty-six hours had never happened, as if the last three years had not happened, as if his life had evaporated into the daydream of a small child, riding the carousel in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, on his first trip back to the States, a marathon journey by ship and by car, his mother standing there, watching him proudly, and himself sucking his melted Popsicle, holding on tightly, hoping that the music would never stop, the carousel would never slow, the ride would never end.

  **Pro** Neil Gaiman, from *American Gods*.  6/12 right

  So many people came down on this one as amateur, and I just do not get it. This is a perfect sentence - an amateur might try it, but it would come off looking, well, amateurish. In Gaiman's hands this is gorgeous... it's a run-on, sure, but it's a beautiful run-on. 

1. The other passengers were much cleaner than me too, didn’t have any traces of grease on their expensive jumpsuits, didn’t stink of manual labor, which they seemed to think gave them the right to look down their noses at me.

    **Amateur**. 8/12 right

  It wasn't the first person that flipped me to amateur - there are lots of great pro 1p stories out there. Rather, it was the ""which they seemed to think "" at the end, which made an otherwise well-constructed sentence into a run-on. The ""didn't""s weren't technically correct, grammatically speaking, but artistically they worked for me. The ""which..."" bit, though, was a new thought.
  
1. Instead of running through city streets firing military weapons, an observer walked city streets watching pigeons; it had occurred to someone that city birds were feathered lab rats in regard to climate change, air pollution, noise, population density, food acceptance, all sorts of things that humans might face as resources dwindled.

    **Amateur**. 9/12 right
    
  It threw me how many folks thought this one was pro. To me, the beginning of this sentence leaps out as amateurish. {Instead of shooting}{an observer walked} - he's an observer, what business would he have shooting? The missing articles (""through [the] city streets"") to no good end also contributed. I loved the stuff after the semicolon, though.
  
1.   He was a tall man, well built, and if we had seen him walking around Piter in street clothes, we would have known him at once for an infiltrator--he had the body of a man who ate meat every day.

  **Pro**. David Benioff, from *City of Thieves* 11/12 right.
	
  This one screams pro at me, and at almost everyone who responded. ""the body of a man who ate meat every day"" is just perfect - tells an entire story right in one compact sentence. That sort of narrative efficiency is *rarely* seen in amateur writers, at least the ones I've read.

Suken Anisaria’s just starting out as a bounty hunter in D’n’cade, a floating city riddled with crime, corruption and magical convergences powering everything from rail-cars to crossbow bolts.  He’s got years of training under his belt, a hatful of his dead uncle’s debts to pay off, and the talent and drive to become one of the best hunters in the city.  The problem is, no one else believes that he’s destined to be the best.  So when a murder warrant goes up for Fletch Greencloak, he jumps on the chance to track down the notorious thief and make a name for himself.  

Hunting’s never an easy job, but this warrant’s harder than most.  Greencloak’s practically a ghost – a very light-fingered ghost.  He’s a master of disguise and is infamously solitary, making it damn near impossible to find leads on him, but Suken’s got contacts that give him an edge on the competition.  He’s certain that he’s got this case in the bag… but the whole job goes sour when he uncovers evidence that Greencloak is being framed for the murders.  The guards won’t take action without hard evidence, but evidence is hard to find when professional assassins begin tailing his every step.  He can’t call in help from the other bounty hunters without jeopardizing his reputation, so he’s forced to take drastic measures, measures he never thought he’d consider.  He teams up with the notorious thief he was supposed to bring to justice.  

With assassins and the other bounty hunters closing in on all sides, Suken and Fletch are forced to put aside their ideologies and the burgeoning sparks of romantic interest in order to catch the real killer before it’s too late.  

-----

~~Suken Anisaria’s just starting out as a bounty hunter in D’n’cade, a floating city riddled with crime, corruption and magical convergences powering everything from rail-cars to crossbow bolts. He’s got years of training under his belt, a hatful of his dead uncle’s debts to pay off, and the talent and drive to become one of the best hunters in the city. The problem is, no one else believes that he’s destined to be the best. So when a murder warrant goes up for Fletch Greencloak, he jumps on the chance to track down the notorious thief and make a name for himself.~~

~~Hunting’s never an easy job, but this warrant’s harder than most. Greencloak’s practically a ghost – a very light-fingered ghost. He’s a master of disguise and is infamously solitary, making it damn near impossible to find leads on him. Even the most experienced hunters have never caught him. Suken has to pull in favors and make deals with some colorful locals, but he finally gets a solid lead. He thinks that he’s got this case in the bag… but the whole job begins to go sour when he uncovers evidence that Greencloak is being framed for the murders. The guards won’t take action without hard evidence, and someone in the city obviously doesn’t want Suken finding any. Assassins begin hunting him and those he loves, and he can’t tell the other bounty hunters about Greencloak’s innocence without jeopardizing his reputation. With no other options, Suken is forced to team up with the notorious thief, who turns out to be very different from what Suken had expected.~~

~~The two have to learn to work through differences in ideology and a generous portion of romantic tension in order to catch the real killer before the assassins manage to catch up with Suken, or Greencloak is found by the other bounty hunters. And through it all, Suken has to try to keep his professional reputation intact.~~

~~Well… no one ever said bounty hunting was easy.~~

I'm struggling in getting started...  Usually I start by designing a map and a world with locales I think will be interesting... simultaneously starting to think about cultures and peoples of the world while placing cities and features on the map.  From there I think about specific characters and how they fit into society... I have no problem with characters and find it easy to visualize and flesh them out.  I don't get frustrated with this.

But here is where I get stuck.  I never get to actually writing.  I feel like I have a good idea of how my world works, and who the people are in it... and I have a general sense of what sort of plot I might like to create, but moving forward from here is difficult.  How do you start to plan the plot and make progress in actually getting started writing?  How do you begin the process of committing to an outline or at least a start to the story?

Maybe I'm doing it wrong.  Do you need a plot before you make a world?  How specific should each step get before moving on to the next in a writing project?

-------------

EDIT:  Thanks for your replies.  Very helpful.  For reference, I looked up some AMAs to see how other authors have answered this same question... I am summarizing below... I may add more as I research more.

**Margaret Weis**: I have to know the end before I can start.

**Brandon Sanderson**: I plot a medium amount, focused on goals. I usually build my outline backward. I decide what I want to happen, I write that event down, then I write bullet points beneath it to lay the groundwork of what would have to happen for it to occur.

**Robin Hobb**: For me, the story always starts with a character. The character steps out onto the stage and starts talking, and the world starts forming up around him. Who is he, what was his family like, what did his father do for a living? Then the world gets bigger. Is this a seacoast town or a farm on the plains, is he rich or poor, what is the geography, the economy,the political situation? We see it all through the lens of that character, and your reader really only needs to know how it affects that character. This is how I do it.

I also liked Robin's advice on editing: Every sentence in a book or story has to do one of those three things: advance the plot, tell something about the character, or describe the setting. A good sentence does all three.

I realized as I did it that I'd gotten a better grasp of the flow of the story, especially for this particular character, than I had doing a general outline.

So I started doing individual outlines for each character, framing events from their POV, including events which wouldn't show up in-novel and ignoring events they wouldn't be involved in.

Then I searched top books. Most of them were free, just given away. Which I support- but all the other books those authors had, which were for sale, didn't do as well.

And I find myself afraid. I'm so tangled up in the idea of writing as a career and a job that I can't help but feel like this is an assignment now. 

What if I do write my stories and no one sees them? At most I can plug it in a few subreddits and get friends to pass it about- which may result in very little. I'm an English Major, I don't want to teach- I have no idea what I'll do in life if this fails.

I want my books read, and have enough money to live without too much hassle. I don't believe that's asking 'too much' but it all just sort of hit me right now.

There's a stick in the spokes of the cycle of seasons.  It's sort of purgatorial:  perpetually overcast, no wind, neither warm nor cold.  It's stuck at the beginning of spring.  There's little shoots and things, and critters are scarce.  Most are hibernating, and the ones that aren't don't have a lot to support them.

No response came from the dilapidated cottage, but the campfire roasting a haunch of uneaten deer told Payte that the man was still within earshot. The moon hung brightly overhead, illuminating the desert scrub surrounding the clapboard building.

“Come on out Dob, we aren’t here to start trouble. The new queen has given pardon. Hell, if it weren’t for the Mage-Corps…”

“Liar!” boomed a distant voice. Damn, the ridge, idiot, not the shack. Higher ground. “Liar!”

Brouse wheeled to the right, his left hand heaving a heavy pistol from his hip. The light gray flint thumbed back, scattering moonlight from it’s uneven facets.

“Put it down Brouse.” Payte whispered.

Brouse leveled his hand at the ground but continued to squint suspiciously at the ridge. His thick bald head was glistening wet. Small, crushed leaves still stuck to his moist dark skin and as silly as Payte believed the old tradition was, he was glad for any help the ritual bath may have provided.

“On your knees, and face the fire!” commanded the distant voice.

“We’re only here to talk”

“On your knees!” Dobb spat. “Or we end it here, now!”

The desert sands felt warm against Payte’s legs as he followed the order. He fought back the urge to reach for the charring deer as the scent wafted unmercifully around him. It had been days since they had found decent game, and the crackling haunch on the fire had set Payte’s tongue swimming in thick saliva. As he stared at the blackening meat, a dim shadow grew and stretched his periphery. Larger it grew until finally, the shadow’s feet stopped over his right shoulder.

Payte lowered his head but peered beneath his arm catching a glimpse of a shimmering pale silhouette.

“Gods man, it’s worse than I thought.” said Payte, momentarily forgetting the direness of the situation and turning his head to take in the translucent figure.

The tattered remains of Dobb’s uniform seemed to slip and weave. Ducking, at times, beneath his pale skin like a discarded rag fighting to stay afloat on water. His guidestone glowed brightly orange floating above his chest. There was no chain or setting, it simply hung freely in the air at a fixed point as the flesh and cloth of Payte’s former seargent rose and fell, breathing around it. Dobb had only a hint of hands emerging from his dark blue sleeves. There were no boots, only pale glassy calves terminating into a tangle of foot-like mist.

“Why did you come?”, Dobb asked. “Why couldn’t you just let me be at peace. I’m no threat, Payte. Not anymore. Just a tired husk of a man. I only wanted to get away from it all. Is it not enough that we ruined ourselves for that pig? How much must we give, Payte. How much can they take from us? I’m nearly gone, why can’t they just let me die out here alone. And how much silver lines your pockets now? Was it worth the lives? Do you dream sweetly knowing that your pockets jingle with the bounties of your friends?

“You don’t understand. No one sent us, Dobb. It’s all over. The king is dead. The new Queen pardoned all of those who rose against him. Don’t you understand, we lost! You’re not a traitor, you’re a hero.”

Even as he spoke, Payte began to see the grains of auburn sand shifting and streaming, the rivulets running towards the only standing figure. Before he could act, Brouse had lifted his pistol and leveled the sights on Dobb. The flint fell against the steel plate of the lock with a decisive click dragging spark to powder. Dobb raised his hand as thunder spoke a moment later as the powder in the pistol exploded. The breach flashed and the iron gave way, throwing smoke and light in all directions as the handle became a mass of burning splinters flying through the air. Brouse roared as fingers and flesh exploded, eyes wide with disbelief.

Payte instinctively reached to the soft, orange glow of his guidestone muttering quickly as a soft blue glow formed a dome around them. The mass began to solidiy and Payte felt as if a thousand hooks were tearing his flesh inward. He continued to speak, still kneeling, eyes closed, as the pain mounted. The crescendo of agony turned to bliss as the wall exploded outward and drove Dobb to the edge of the fire’s flickering light. Brouse was still propped neatly on his knees blinking at the smoldering stump of his mangled left arm, the bubbling remains dripping from smoking bones, burnt black by the overcharge of powder.

Meanwhile, Dobb had already regained his stance, a glowing red orb was growing steadily between the twitching ghosts of his hands. A moment later, the comet-like manifestation lurched forward and crashed against the protective dome with a shower of sparks and heat. In a split-second, the small dome had shattered and dissolved into the desert air. Payte fought the casting pain again as a steel great sword appeared before him. The shining steel slipped forward and rushed with terrifying speed before coming to rest in the Dobb’s gut.

Dobb stood for a moment. As if to process what his body already knew, before falling to his back on the warm sand.

“It didn’t have to be this way!” Payte yelled with hands still belching yellow smoke. “The War is over! The war is over and we lost! We lost Dobb!”

There was no hint of recognition in the old sargeant’s eyes as he drifted off, only the pale stare of a dead man. The still corporeal parts of him shook violently on the sand as the greatsword began to fade into mist leaving only an ugly, ragged wound to the gut. His last words obscured by a death rattle through clenched teeth.

First, sorry if this is the wrong place to pose this question, I was in /r/writing and found a link to this sr, and I thought you'd be able to help me out. I'm currently writing a first novel, it's only really for my own sake as it's something I enjoy doing.

Anyway, I've been asked before what the genre of it is, and to be honest with you I can't tell. I think it's fantasy, because there is a fair amount of fantastical stuff going on, my protagonist is a young man (around 20) who had a vision of a ghostly hand in a forest whose presence now leads him to places and new experiences. I guess my question is, how much fantasy does a book need for it to qualify as fantasy? There's a lot of realism still in the story, but it's just that the main storyline is driven by the vision and overwhelming presence of this 'thing'. I guess it's a big ask but if you'd be willing to have a quick look that'd be awesome, the 'fantasy' stuff is around page 10.

I'm currently in the midst of writing a series of four books, whether I am going to self-publish or seek a 'traditional' route is still uncertain, and I was wondering what you all think of big leaps of history between books. Each book of my series, lets call it the Cul-Khara Sequence, is meant to be able to be read as a stand-alone novel. I have nothing against a long series similar to ASoIaF, but it just isn't the kind of story I want to write. The books are largely linked by their themes and the fact that they share a world, albeit at quite different stages of history.

Book 1 takes place in 1630-33 of this world - an equivalent time would be similar to the 1850's. In this book a number of world-altering events occur. Genocide is committed, the major city of the book (I'll name it Fobbington) is bombed, and so on. Book 2 takes place in 1672, so roughly forty years later. In this book you see the long-term ramifications of Book 1, as well as a story with a largely new cast of characters. Some characters on the fringe of Book 1 now take centre stage, small companies now are major corporations, parkland at the edge of the city is now a slum. By the end of Book 2, Fobbington has seen a near cataclysmic event. Its monarchy has been slaughtered, and the Minister of Internal Affairs took control in a short and bloody military coup. Funnily enough, the ending of this book is the most hopeful.

Book 3 takes another leap in history, the story now in 1778, and also in geography. The story is set in one of the former colonies of Flobbington, now its own city-state. Technology has advanced significantly, and the plot centres upon the government initiating a city wide surveillance system. All sorts of shenanigans take place: there is an attempted revolution, which nearly succeeds. Ultimately, though, the people give power back to their duchess and decide to return to their sub-par lives.

By Book 4, we jump nearly one hundred and forty years, to 1916. The story follows this world's equivalent of space travel, on a society's first attempted breach of the 'final frontier.' Nine astronauts are sent on the expedition, whereupon they discover a ghost civilisation. Things go horribly wrong. The whole story is narrated by the last of the astronauts as she waits for her oxygen to run out.

Throughout the series it becomes clear that events from each of the books affect one another. There are instances where actions in the future affect the past - unexplained events in Book 1 being a result of actions in Book 4, and so on. I also want to show a world progressing, or at least trying to progress, from its prior failures. I want to show how consequences matter both immediately and generations after the fact. I want readers to really feel the history of this world, not as something bolted to the tail-end of my narrative but as something that is living and evolving over each volume. Even though I do not particularly like his books, I understand that Brandon Sanderson has done something like this with his Mistborn books.

“Brace!” the fur-clad man yelled, “Brace!”

The rain continued to pour. Coupled with the tossing waves and the resultant sea-mist, it seemed the air itself was drenched with water. Aslinrir examined his bow – it was damp. A limp string and a sheath of sodden arrows would make it impossible to shoot properly.

 “Draw your swords,” the man barked as the boat neared the beach. He looked grim; scars pierced his face in long, thin, creases. “Swordsmen -  keep the left flank; hug the dune-line. Understand? Spearmen, the king’s banner. Archers, follow me – we take the centre. Helmets!” Aslinrir glanced towards his right. A man, Morcar, sat there. He looked towards Morcar, and gave a nod of acknowledgement. Morcar smiled back weakly - his chin lined with short, brown stubble and face drawn with anxiety. Aslinrir understood. 

They could be dead by this afternoon.

He fidgeted with his bow; winding the string in coils between his fingers, picking the ends to shreds. His breath hastened – rapid intakes of air to ease the pangs of fear circulating around his body.

“Clear the ramp!” the man shouted, “Raised shield formations – we’re gonna need some protection from above. Cover as much ground as quickly as possible. Don’t break from formations – if the ranks fail, you’re as good as dead. Other than that,” he grimaced slightly, “I’ll see you there.” 

The wooden longboat slammed onto the beach.  The grim-faced man pushed forward a slab of wood, bridging the gap between the beach and the boat. Along the coast, several hundred other longships struck the shore, each one laden with soldiers and the red-green standards of Idalion. Aslinrir around, wondering why he had given up his studies at one of the most prominent city universities to join the army. How had it come to this?

Now he was in the middle of nowhere, reassigned from the heart of the Republic to this dusty backwater at the edge of the frontier. He brought his hand to his face, shielding his eyes from the sun. It was hot, and it was still morning. Great. 

	
He heard a curse and looked to his left. Three men, dressed in leather armor, daggers and pistols at their hips walked towards them, sweating profusely. 
They saluted as they came, a fist going over their hearts. They were all unshaven, covered in dust. 

“You must be the new Constable.” The one in the lead said, spitting a wad of brown tobacco onto the tracks. 

“Aye,” the man affirmed, “Trelan D’ami.” He returned the salute. 
	
The men nodded, the first extended his hand, Trelan shook it. “Welcome to Palisade.”

“Nice town you’ve got here,” Trelan said, looking out at the unpaved streets that were strewn with horse dung, the wooden buildings with gaps in the walls.

Since I've never had any feedback on my fantasy, I was really glad to find this subreddit. I won't post anything very long- I just want to know if I'm any good at all because, honestly, I have no idea and it frustrates me. I'll appreciate any form of criticism, because I have absolutely zero idea what I'm doing, even though I do it an awful lot.

	I don’t know about you, but I like my magic dirty.
	I like snake-oil potions in old whiskey bottles covered with greasy fingerprints and sold in back alley deals where you don’t know if what you’re getting the good stuff that will cure what ails you or the bad stuff that will make your mouth dry up and your eyes bleed. 
	I like my magic black under the fingernails, like you get from carving grimy little luck charms of coal, and surreptitiously stroking them in your pocket during a game of poker. I like my magic underhanded, like scooping up your winnings remorselessly with a crooked grin.

	I suppose that flowing emerald robes and pretty words and shiny hair is nice enough. And I don’t blame you for preferring it, if you prefer it. But I’ve studied at the Academy, and I’ve seen it all - the gardens and the libraries and the echoing alabaster hallways. But the whole time I was there, I was always yearning to get back to The Heavenly City, because I like my magic dirty, stinking, slobbering, and obscene.

The story is set in the same feudal/medieval/fantasy/semi-steampunk world as my others.  It features the main character as an elf and a sort of religious witch-hunter (think a blend of Solomon Kane, the Witcher, and Van Helsing), with a mission from the setting's Vatican-esque faction to hunt down and bring to justice a threatening and evil necromancer.

Over time, the main character starts to question his faith and beliefs and the manner in which he conducts his missions (ie: the means to an end, sometimes forsaking morality to get at those branded evil).  On top of that, he begins to form or already has a previous history with either the antagonist or one of his major villainous henchmen that continually stokes the fires of his vengeance and duty.  In my setting, elves are intrinsically empathetic to the general emotions of those around them and the health and stress of the earth itself, so all of the violent acts taken or witnessed by the main character continually take a toll on him throughout the series.

The idea for this character and story came to me when I was reading about pulp fiction.  While the story and setting I'm going to be writing in will be serious, dark, and gritty, I want the main character to have a sort of ""believable ridiculousness"" to him - one of the main things I love about the witch hunter archetype is the vast array of weaponry available to him, and this is something I intend to carry over into my story.  I'd like the main character to have a bit of a superhero vibe to him, and to be generally armed to the teeth with all manner of sword, axe, flintlock, hand crossbow, alchemical explosives, and potions.  One of my questions to you is: considering this is done right (believably, with his transport and carrying of his arsenal physically possible), is this *too* ridiculous for you?  It's one of the most fun aspects of the character and one of the major reasons I'd like to write the story, but I still want it to be grounded in reality and not threatening the suspension of disbelief.

Anyway, thank you for taking the time to read this and for any opinions you might have.  I can answer any questions you raise so long as I have an answer, and I apologize if I didn't describe myself as well as I had hoped; this post was written better in my head while I was in the shower, and I guess I lost some of its structure in the two minutes it took me to dress.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_1f3vdz,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1f3vdz/story_idea_would_this_interest_you_enough_to_read/,

Blood soaked into the thin layer of snow on the ground, tainting it a dark, unseemly red. Guards armor lay strewn about and the bodies of the dead lay in the field, on their side of the caravan. The whiz of arrows filled the air, as the attackers sat in their foxholes, and fired on the pinned men. Orcish archers, dug well into the rocks. The singing of bows was constant, and those men didn't have much time left. The wind and rain fell on his weathered face slowly. His beard was drenched by the water. He donned his helm, its leather sides and metal cap were cold on the inside, probably because of the light snow rain mixture that had been falling for the past few hours. His chainmail was covering a boiled leather tunic, and the links were beaded with water. His thin leather gloves clasped an axe in one hand, and a shield in the other. The ten of them stayed low, moving from brush to brush, through the rocks and high grass. The ambushers were well set into the rocks of the hill below, and had clearly been waiting there for quite some time. “They’ve got no way to move, they're sitting ducks” said Dante, smirking, and pulling his hammer from his belt. A low chuckle came from a few of the others who drew their weapons as well. Their leader, Garnter sat crouched in the shadow of an overhang, his long hair dripping with rain water, his fur cloak drenched. His sword rested on his shoulder.

“Erik, what do you think we should do?”

“That's not my choice to make lord.” He responded.

“It is if I ask it of you, and I am asking it of you.”

“We need to help those men, they’ve not got much time left.”

“Agreed, but how?”

“I'm not the one trained in military strategy lord.”

“No, you're the one trained in carrying out military strategy.”

                      He signaled for the crossbowmen to move, they did so promptly, and posted up on a rock formation, looking down on the ambushers. Erik Marsen pulled his own war axe off of his belt, and clasped it tightly. Garnter gave the signal. They charged down the hill. Blades in the air, they poured over the rocks, screaming at the top of their lungs. One of the archers turned toward him, fear in his eyes. Erik hit him so hard the poor orc was lifted off his feet, and tossed down the hill, bow and all. On the left he saw a hammer swing into an orcs head, reducing it to a stump. The retort of the crossbows was heard, and still more men fell. One of the archers had turned and loosed an arrow, sending it whizzing by his head. “You vile shit.” he whispered. Now Garnter was on him, hacking into the archers shoulder, and driving the sword through his chest. Now the battle was all around them, screams and yelling, the clashing of steel. Blod covered the rocks. Erik felt a searing pain in his side, and looked down to see the tail of an arrow protrude from his right side. He looked to where it was fired from, and saw the bowman perched on a rock, staring at him with fear in his eyes. Erik tore the arrow from his side, and threw it away. The man made to run down the rocks, but fell, and was sent tumbling down the hill. He was stunned, and struggled to his feet, blood pouring from his nose. He took a half hearted step away from Erik, yet he was too slow. The axe bit through skin, bone, and flesh alike, and the orc let out a piercing scream. over and over he hacked at the man's stomach, arms and sides until he at last stopped screaming. Pain was flooding through his side.

                    He heard a fell cry, and spun to see an orc charging him, sword in hand, rainwater pouring down around the two of them. Erik brought up his shield, sending the first blow bouncing off the oak with a dull thump His own axe flew through the air, narrowly missing his opponent. The orc wrenched his sword form Erik’s shield, and swung, all his weight behind it. The wind rushed out of him, the sword dug into the chainmail, he felt the links come together, barely holding back the blade from his stomach. The other man lunged, sending the sword ripping through the air toward Erik, he dodged, and sent a cut flying downward on the man's outstretched arm. The man wailed as his arm was split in two, the sword tumbled to the ground, clattering down the slope. Erik spun on his heel, turning to face the others. Only few of the bandits remained, they were either in the process of being killed, or were already dead. Erik sat down heavily. ""I’m getting too old for this."" he said quietly.

“Erik, you're hurt.” said one of the men, his blond hair tied back in a knot.

“So it would seem Adieke.” Erik responded. Adieke was new blood, young, and foolish at that. He was blessed 
with good looks, but everyone agreed he’d lose them in some barfight, one which he most likely started.

“Here, I've got a little something for you.” he handed him a vial of red liquid.

“Healing potion, from our last stop in town.” Erik looked suspiciously at the vial.

“You're sure that the alchemist you bought this from was trustworthy?” Erik was always suspicious of magic users. “If it doesn’t work, I’ll bury him, now drink.” Even Erik smiled at that. He looked suspiciously at the liquid, touched the vial to his lips, and drank. He felt the potion take effect at once. Relief and warmth swept throughout his body, he felt his wound seal and though some pain stayed, he was fine.

“What are orcs doing this far east?”

“I’m not an orc, I wouldn’t know.”

“I never said you were, but the question stands, they do not belong here.”

“Looks like our friends aren’t very happy we saved them.” Adieke commented. Erik looked toward the caravan, further down the hill. Outside it, the remaining guardsmen had formed a loose shield wall, archers poking out from behind wagons, training their weapons on their saviors. Opposite them Granter stood. Adieke was beside him, now so were two others. The crossbowmen came down from the cliff, and joined their line. Slowly, the band of bloody warriors formed up. They outnumbered the guards 4 to one, and all of them were better armed, larger and a good bit more frightening than their counterparts. Granter let out a low chuckle. “Who do you fight for?!” demanded one of the guards. “Well that all depends who you work for.” responded Granter “Well said my friend, well said indeed.” came a voice. Muddied boots steped out from behind one of the caravans. A merchantman clad in orange and purple silks walked toward the party. “Lower your weapons you bloody idiots, if they wanted us dead, we wouldn't be able to have this conversation.” The guards did so cautiously. “Come, we have much to talk about, Granter of Black Hill.”

Dixon

It was raining again, and he loved it. It reminded him of home, brought him back to the days where everything was fine. When his family was still alive, where every day wasn’t a reminder of his isolation. Only then the rain was snow. He stopped, his cloak coming to rest at boot height, his chainmail shuffling and coming to rest at last, he stood and listened. He felt water drip as the metal rings of his hood had rested against his forehead. He heard rain plinking off the iron cap helm he wore, and watched it run down the nose guard that dropped down the middle of his face. He shifted letting his bastard sword swing in its scabbard, clanking against the oaken shield on his back. He glanced down, his tunic was drenched, the white tunic he wore over his mail. He studied it for a few moments, the red and yellow cloth tied as a shas from shoulder to hip, and then the red and white, and red and yellow ones which held his arrow, sheather, and crossbow. as a result of this, the ends of the cloth draped off him, these form the belts rested between his knees, and the sash ending about the middle of his thigh. He at last looked up, he could hear the rain falling, listen to the sound of it pitter pattering on the pines, the oaks. He breathed deeply, the smells of the forest filling his nostrils. It was almost his favorite place. But not quite, he thought. Something dark and evil lurks in these woods, something that would kill you if it had the chance. Something worse than wolves or goblins. He shivered.

“Dixon,” came a shout, “We have to keep moving!”

“Aye old man.” he replied, a playful smile creasing his lips.

“At least I can keep up.”He replied, a chuckle and a smile following. Dixon turned to see Trowner. The old man’s 
grizzled face was covered in wrinkles, his hair thinned considerably, his beard drenched. “Aye” He replied. Trowner turned, his bearskin cloak flowing as he walked, his massive great axe, Bear strapped to his back. Dixon jogged over, catching up in a few long strides. Next to them walked Father Browsten, his thing brown hair illuminated by the lantern he carried at his side. His mace swung at his hip, next to it his iron cap.
“Thought you had left us there for awhile child.” said the cleric, his jolly tone carried through the rain and wind.
“Not to worry father, after all, what would I do without you? You’ve got the wine after all!” Father Browsten threw back his head and roared in response. For a time they all walked on in silence. The sound of their boots, Dixon’s mail , and the rain all becoming one harmonious racket. The silence was shattered at once, out of the woods rushed a figure. A another man came crashing through the undergrowth, and stumbled into the pathway before the trio. The racquet his warhammer made was not even apparent, despite the din of the rain. His beard was, as Trower’s was, drenched through and through, except his went halfway down his chest, whereas Trower’s ended about half an inch off his old face. The mans pointed helm sat on his head, its horsehair plume as drenched as its wearer, and unluckily for them the harsh rain came down in sheets by now. The man fell on his knees, sucking in air, gasping as he exhaled. “What's wrong Berin! Spit it out man!” Dixon said, helping him to his feet

“Ganath spotted something on the road coming behind us!” Berin said.

“What?” Trower asked, worry creasing his old face.

“Armed men, a colum of them, mounted, coming this way.” “What sigil did they bear?” Trower interjected “I’m 
not sure, I was on my wa-”

“They bear the sigil of House Verigron.” came a voice. All of them turned their eyes to the source of this new voice. Out of the brush came Ganthar, seemingly melting from the trees behind him, his green cloak swinging 
about his boots, his bow slung across his back.

“Leave it too and elf to scare you shitless.” Dixon said.

“It’s more fun that way.” he responded, smiling cleverly.

“Verigon? If Verigon is on the move they're sure to be trouble about.”

“Well we’ve done them no harm after all, we've nothing to fear from these men, They are our friends if anything.” Father Browsten insisted informed them.

“Trower, we should wait for them here, dark things lurk in these woods, and it’ll soon be night, a time during 
which I’d rather be with an armed column than with just a few men.” Dixon said

“Agreed.” Ganthar said.

“They’ll be on us soon, get off the road, I’ll do the talking, trouble starts, you run as fast and as far as you can.” Trower ordered, moving to face the direction from which the riders would come. Dixon gave a nod following Ganthar and Father Browsten off the path and into a cluster of rocks among the trees on the inclined hill. They all settled, eyes darting around, ears on end listening. Dixon could feel the butterflies joining in his stomach, his heart beginning to race, the woods for a moment, were silent for the exception of the lashing rain. Then, he heard the sound of hooves pounding the dirt.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_1edwdw,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1edwdw/story_in_the_workings_this_is_what_i_have_so_far/,

This means her friends and family are all dead... her parents died right down the hall. And that's something she's having to deal with (though we come in a couple days *after* the fact).

So, when we come in to the story, everyone is already dead. *Recently* dead, but dead nonetheless, and our character is sorting herself out. How do you feel about that?

The thing to keep in mind is that the deaths aren't necessarily supposed to affect the *reader*. I know they can't. It's not possible without knowing the characters first, then being there when they die. Her town being attacked is what sets the story in motion, or at least it's a large event that is central to the story.

Around 200K. I've been working on it for years, so it isn't something I've just slapped together. I'm in the final steps of polishing before querying to agents.

Problem is, I need a reader who's willing to consistently read a chapter or two every 1-3 days and give feedback. I will be more than willing to reciprocate the same for a fellow writer.

As for the novel itself, just think Game of Thrones meets Mistborn. 5 POV characters, both male and female.

Politics, sword-fighting, demons, magic, anti-magic, murders, executions meets airships, steam coaches, artillery cannons, automaton soldiers, old advanced civilizations and industry. 

Religion vs Science. The old way vs the new.

Here's the blurb:

*Since the plans of the Arcane Alchemists have become public knowledge, a steam-powered revolution has taken control of the lives of all who call the lands of Ventris, their home. Now, airships reign the dominion known as the skies once ruled by the hawks and crows. But the changing ways of the world speak naught of the nature of lords and kings.*

*War remains. Betrayal lives. Death endures.*

*In the midst of the War of Winters, a silent battle of attrition that grips the three struggling empires of the Alchemists, High Elves and the Grand Republic, five must discover different fates within the pages of the unfolding legend. A brilliant and young general searches for his place under his king at war, a mage possessed by an ancient demon looks for the truth behind his past, a prince is forced to ascend the throne in the wake of his father's capture, a duchess is torn between her clashing father and grandfather and an uncertain priestess holds questions of the Elementals without lucid answers in her heart.*

I'll find a way to give back to someone who's willing to take the time and read the entire novel.

Probably the most I wrote was when I participated in Nano last year with it. It's not very good, but at least I wrote something.

The trouble I'm coming to is that, the way I see it, there's a couple of different ways to write a novel. The first is that you do very little pre-planning, you just barrel ahead with it and work out the plot holes when you edit. The second is that you plan nearly everything out beforehand; the world, the characters, the ""important bits"" and then, when you have that, you write it.

With my current work I'm trying to do a bit of both; I have the skeletal structure of a world in my head, and a few strong characters to live in it. I know the overarcing plot, I know where it starts, I know big things that happen throughout the story, and I'm reasonably comfortable with an end.

But I'm finding that every time I write, I get to a point where I just can't write any more, because I don't understand enough about the world that I'm writing about.

E.g., a child gets taken to a religious faction, but the religious faction is corrupt and then his life is a bit miserable for a while. But I don't have a clear history of the religion in my head, I just know it's a religoius place. So then I try to delve into worldbuilding a bit more, but then before I can think of what I need to, I need to build about a hundred other things (full geography, history, myths and legends, important people, etc.) which - it just, it all feels like it's so much when all I want to do is get over the hump that I'm against and keep writing.

I'm not new to writing, but I've barely ever been able to finish anything and I have a feeling it's because I tend to bite off more than I can chew.

Does anyone have any worldbuilding or novel writing experience that could help me?

I exhaled slowly as I knelt down to the shivering, smoking figure at my feet.
“Þú skalt ekki framar, Hunter. Ég mun koma aftur,” said the now smoldering vampire. He was speaking Icelandic… Translates to: “Thou shalt no more, Hunter. I will come back.”
Then it began a coughing, raspy laugh. I withdrew my sword, held it to the vampire’s throat and whispered to it “Come back from this, fucker.”
The blade slid through its neck, bone and all, as if it were nothing more than a cloud of smoke. There was no fire, no fancy show. Just a small flash from his eyes and a puff of smoke as I watched the vampire finally die.
“About damn time,” I muttered.
I stood up and stalked back to my car, back hurting and the beginnings of a headache forming in the center of my forehead. You’d think for an immortal, I’d be impervious to pain… Oh, if only…
I opened the door to my ’73 ‘Cuda and all but fell into the driver seat. I turned the key and groaned as the 426 Hemi began to make the car wobble… Note to self: Power is nice, but comfort is starting to become key. I wonder how those Prius things ride? Hey! They’re even “Eco-Friendly”. As old as I am, and with the whole being immortal thing, maybe it’s time I start being a bit more conservative towards our environment… Oh wait… I forgot, I already am… I exterminate the most dangerous species on the planet…
They’re called many different things, and vary in physical features, habits, and abilities… They go by Lamia in Latin, Upir by the Czechs… I just call them what they are… Vampires.
If a thought of Twilight just popped into your head, stop reading. These are not the friendly, loveable people of fiction like that. These are ravenous, bloodthirsty, demented, evil, vile creatures that feel nothing but thirst, anger and lust. No one knows where they originally came from. And frankly, I don’t care. I know that they predate Christianity, because so do I. I was born over 2300 years ago. I was the only son of a farmer in what is now called Scotland. I lived a simple life, and died at the age of 27. I was killed by a vampire while tending my livestock. I was revived by an ancient organization called The League of Hunters. I was quite lucky actually. The vampire who took me was still in the juvenile stages. It only drank from me, and left my body whole. Once a vampire reaches full adulthood, they begin devouring their victims, leaving only hair and bones. But because I was still whole, The Hunters were able to bring me back. I’m not sure how, or how long it took. But I do know that it’s only been done twice. The first time was a failure… I was the success. After they realized what they’d created, The Hunters abandoned the pursuit. You see… while they did bring me back, they did not restore me to normal. They cursed me with an eternity on earth. During his feeding, the vampire left traces of himself on me, and when I was revived, I took on his traits. I’m inhumanly strong. I will not die from age, and it takes one hell of an ass whooping to knock me outta commission. I don’t really know if I’m “invincible”… but I’m not exactly biting at the bit to find out.

I love working with random inputs, what can I say? Right now I'm working on refining a random character generator I created last year, and one of the new components is character goals. I'm currently compiling and refining a massive list of actions that would be appropriate for character goals.

This morning I was trying to break down a scene in which nothing much happens - my WIP introduces the big bad and his big bad ways in a prologue, and this is the scene where the protags discover what the audience has therefore known from the beginning. All I knew going in was that the protag interrogates the last surviving victim for information about the Big Bad, and as a result of that interrogation the survivor ceases surviving.

I was stumped, I tell you. I had no idea how to make this scene interesting, how to give it stakes and forward motion and make it generally awesome.

So I brainstormed for a bit, came up with a tiny little glimmer of Maybe, but still not enough. 

And then I says to myself, I says, ""Goals! the characters' goals right now are to do what the plot needs them to - to interrogate this person. But given that the reader will already know most of what will come out of it, that's going to be a yawner.""

And once I had that idea...random goal generator, here we come. Well, random goal database, here we come, I don't have it coded yet. But I randomly picked 3 numbers, poked through the table... and protag 1's goal was to bespell someone; protag 2's goal was to chart something, and the survivor's goal was to seduce someone. That was all I needed - Character 2 was going to try to map the scene, the survivor's symptoms, etc., and report in; Character 1 was, because of who she was, going to resort to magic to speed things up (and that was how the survivor was going to die, from a spell gone wrong that Character 1 couldn't stop), and the effects suffered by the survivor were such that she needed to become like her near-killer--to seduce someone, with the attendant side effects--to save her own life. Everything fell into place in about 20 minutes after that - this is gonna be a great scene, though I'm going to have to work hard to get the reader not to hate my protag after it :).

All of which is to say... when you're stuck in a scene that's just not working, maybe consider  ""random"" goals for your characters, figure out how they might tie into what you need the scene to accomplish, the character's overall scene goal, and the character's personality (and flaws!), and see where it takes you... might be somewhere awesome.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,title,True,t3_1bo6k0,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1bo6k0/using_random_character_subgoals_in_scenes/,

The Atlantians encountered a great civilization there, but due to unknown circumstances almost everyone in the island's civilization died. the remaining were enslaved or murdered. over thousands of years the Atlantians founded a great empire and forgot all about earth. They began to think that earth was just a myth. after thousands of years and several devastating civil wars an archaeologist discovered a strange machine. Eventually it was discovered that the machine was designed to open up portals to other universes. the machine was used and a massive gateway was opened. Suddenly in came the Ancient Atlantians. it turns out that the portal that allowed the Atlantians to enter the island was created by their future selves. the universe of the island is an entirely different universe then that of earth. almost all of the people on the island commit mass suicide to allow their ancestors to live. the few who refuse suicide are quickly overpowered and the story repeats itself.

**Been wanting to write an epic-scale fantasy for a long time. I'm finding it difficult to give it a twist or element that allows it to not be ASoIaF v2.0 or Malazan v1.5 or what have you.**

My idea is for two ancient rival nations be secretly goaded into full-scale by an ambitious third-party, which will then introduce its own 'trump card' (a magic-based superweapon or weapons) to take them out by surprise at a moment of its choosing.

Now, I wanted to at least have the setting resemble at the earliest the 14th century, though I'm willing to go as late as 16th-17th century in terms of technological advancement (i.e. a setting where gunpowder tech exists but hasn't yet rendered armour and swords totally obsolete... I should pop into AskHistorians to research more, methinks...)

I wanted an overall theme of decay, society's and the environment's fabrics fraying from the toll of war, political instability, and abuse of magical power not seen for centuries. One of the rivals is already going through the final throes of a religious civil war, the other suffered setbacks and has lost territory, prestige and is dealing with perpetual unrest throughout its regions (for reasons economic, cultural and racial).

I want this overarching theme to extend to my characters as well. All are dealing with personal issues of various kinds, I basically transposed some of my own perceived personal flaws to the characters.; I felt I could write and model the characters better if I used conflicts and feelings I had some experience with.

I mulled having a mystery/psychological horror undercurrent, which can be assisted by this plot point; the revival and large-scale misuse of magical power is causing 'unnatural' random phenomena to occur, with reality becoming frayed, testing the protagonists' and other characters' mental resolve and sanity as well as posing actual physical threats.

**Any feedback is appreciated**; I do realise what I have is a bit thin on details/specifics. I'll gladly add more upon request. 

**At the same time, what do you guys think are good ways to shake up the classic epic fantasy formula?**

Knights and archers and lords and kings.  My question is probably one that has been asked before, and it comes in two parts.

First, is it acceptable to use the title ""Ser"", when it has basically been coined as Martin's thing?  I would feel as if I'm stealing from him if I were to place Ser in front of my character's names, yet it flows with the time so much better than Sir does.  I think my readers would feel the same and take it that I was just grabbing the word from Martin.  Perhaps I would be better off not using a title at all, now that I think about it.  I just have a feeling that when I get further along in my book, I'm going to want to address some of my characters with a ""Ser"" of some kind.  Does anyone else use a different title in their books?

Second, my list of original names for characters, items, and locations turns out to be not so original.  As I read more and more fantasy, I see the authors using names that are either exact or very similar to the ones I had in mind, and now when I try and use them I can't help but already picture the version used by another author in my mind.  It just doesn't feel right, and again, I would feel like I'm simply stealing the names from them.  A good example is the name Davos.  I had planned to use Davos for a main character way before I read Game of Thrones, so I changed it to Daven, only to see that Martin had used Daven as well for another character in a later book.

1358137245.0,9,self.fantasywriters,16j6qb,My magic system. Thoughts?,,10,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/16j6qb/my_magic_system_thoughts/,"In my world, there are two main sapient species capable of using magic--humans, and a species of shapeshifters called lizard-folk, who shift between a humanoid form (could pass for human at a distance; up close, eyes, facial features, and build will give them away) and a small monitor-lizard-like form. Certain animals can use magic as well. For now, we'll focus on humans.

Magical abilities are present in about 4% of the human population. What magic can do is not strictly limited in any way, however a large array of fairly standard techniques have been developed throughout the years and most humans aren't skilled enough or brave enough to try anything new. Learning magic is difficult, and just as with mundane pursuits, certain people are better at different things, so most humans will specialize in a few techniques, such as:

Natural magic, e.g. shapeshifting, animal communication, tracking a person by the unique ""scent"" of their life essence

Physical magic, e.g. telekinesis, body manipulation (physical augmentation, healing, causing pain), concussive blasts

Mental magic, e.g. mind control, illusions, memory fabrication/deletion, telepathy, sensing whether others can use magic, mental attacks (essentially punching you in the brain with my brain), interfering with others' use of magic

and elemental magic, e.g. fire/water/earth/wind/light/lightning control

Spellcasters can also charm objects to react to a touch or human presence, for example by lighting up, alerting the owner, or incinerating everyone within a five mile radius.

(Lizard-folk live for several thousand years, so they are much more able to become proficient in all forms, unlike the vast majority of humans. Still, many will specialize and become damn good at whatever area they pick.)

For a human, using magic is harder than for animals and for lizard-folk. Tapping into the flow of magic that permeates the earth, without the right precautions, causes extreme pain and permanent bodily harm as the magic essentially rips your flesh apart as it courses through you. To prevent this, human spellcasters must carry with them an item with the right properties to act as a conduit, usually in the form of a ring or armband. Common materials include wood, metal, and crystal. The most prized material for these conduits is a crystalline mineral not found naturally on the planet, but one that is sometimes delivered via meteorites, and is so magically charged that some believe it to be the source of magic in the world (just as some theorize life may have first come to Earth on a meteorite). The magic is channeled through the conduit and shaped to the spellcaster's will to perform whatever function they want. It is still an imperfect connection, and over time, the conduit will wear out and eventually break. If the spellcaster is unfocused when channeling the magic or is using a lot of it, it'll wear out faster. If your conduit is glowing or starts to heat up, that's a good sign to stop.

Magic is physically and mentally taxing just like any other labor, though many small spells are easy enough to perform without fear. While a spellcaster (no matter the species) is channeling magic, they must be focused enough to keep it restrained and controlled until they're done, at which point they let it go gently. If they do lose control, it can have devastating effects on the caster's mind, which, depending on the amount of magic they were tapping into and how badly they screwed up, can range from mild disorientation for a few minutes, to permanent brain damage, to death. Most spellcasters resign themselves to basic tasks that make life easier for them and those around them. Some function as civil servants in the places where they live, using their powers full-time to keep the city or town running smoothly (e.g. driving away pests, healing injuries and illnesses, fixing buildings, sanitizing water, etc.)

I applaud anyone who made it through that. The main character is not a spellcaster (though he does have a passive magical ability unique to him), and only fleeting glimpses of magical training is shown, so it's not like this is going to be presented as is, though magic does play an important role in the story, so I want to make sure that there aren't any contradictions and that the system I have isn't like, completely lame. Also, if something was unclear or doesn't make sense, questions are appreciated.

So I'm posting and expanding, here. 

Hope it's useful!

(Remember, though, that it's just one person's opinion. Certainly I'm no one important. But the below still seems useful and true to me regardless of my unprofessionalism. :) )

--------

&gt; Consider the reader as a blind person. Right now he's standing with you on the edge of a journey. He has his hand on your shoulder, but in a moment he's going to take his hands away and follow you, led by--and only by--what you tell him. 

&gt; There is no ""best"" way to lead him; every journey is different, so the tools you'll use will necessarily be different for every story. But he's always going to be the same person, just as blind. You're going to have to describe the ground so that he'll know where to set his feet. You're going to have to tell him about sudden drops and bumps and turns. But you're going to have to give him just the context he needs - any more, and he's going to lose the thread, fall off a cliff, wander into a dark corner and be eaten by a grue; not enough, and he's just as doomed. Too early or in the wrong order, and it's useless to him. Too late, he's worm-food. But if you get it just right, he'll follow you all the way through and come out the other side having changed for the journey. That's what you're aiming for; that's what a story is.


So how does this work in practice?

* Lead the reader smoothly. Don't jump around (look at this! look at that! he's thinking this! she's doing that!) within a paragraph unless it's your goal to disorient the reader. 

* Consider what the reader needs to know *right now* to understand what's going on. Does the reader *need* the history of the Fallen Lands at this moment, for the story you want to tell? Or does she just need to know that Subpar the Somewhat Awesome is up against a half-dingo wearing a belt of man-teeth?

* Choose wisely what gets highlighted by the choices you make as a writer. Whatever gets focus in that moment is the most important thing in the reader's mind. Are the notches on the blade of Subpar's family-heirloom sword the most important thing *right now* for the reader? If so, great. If not, what is? 

    This requires the writer to know what he or she wants to accomplish. This might not come in the first draft, but by the second the writer should know.

* Pairing with the previous bullet, consider the reader's attention capabilities. Our minds can buffer only so much information. What is the stuff that the writer wants to be in that memory space?

* Consider how to ""inclue"" the reader such that the reader can draw their own conclusions. You're not only guiding the reader through the journey - you're giving him what he needs to find his own way across the journey, and to discover what the journey means to him. When we tell the reader every little thing and don't trust the reader to do any work, he's not going to get anything out of that journey but the things that the writer as his guide puts in. This isn't best practice, because  a reader being told everything is a reader who tunes out and disengages.

First, I'm creating the geography/topography/climate/ nature of the world, including the weather patterns, as well as ancient patterns of glaciation and warming. Then I'm going to write a (very rough) evolutionary history of how one group of early progenitors evolved and -- due to various pressures -- how that ancestor race split into the races that eventually became the elder races: Elves, Dwarves, and Goblins.

Then, I'm going to compose a rough history of that world starting several thousand years before whenever my story is set, which will be based on the geography and climate, as well as the traits that evolved among the different races (or the traits that emerged when those races came back in contact with eachother and interbred). As a part of that, I'm developing not only an ethnographic history of the sentient races involved -- in terms of when their civilizations arose, how they arose, how one might displace another, etc -- but also I'm fleshing out the religious histories of these cultures. And I mean, not just, say, throwing together a pantheon for each culture -- I want to put together an evolving history of their respective religious beliefs that have changed over the centuries and millennia in an immitation (admittedly simplified) of the way that pantheons and religions change/evolve in the real world.

In theory, a combination of the geography, the resources of that geography, and the ethnic histories and religious evolution within those cultures will then help me shape the economic and military histories of these societies, which is to say, the histories of how the different races/cultures in this world have interacted in the past.

Once I have all that -- a formed world, with a rich setting, and several thousand years worth of history and the various developments, rises, falls, and ruins that come from such a history -- I want to only then start trying to figure out what my story will be about, what sort of characters are in that story, and what their motivation is, and what they're trying to achieve. I want the characters and the story to organically come from a preexisting world, rather than cobbling together some characters and a plot, and then building a world around them. The idea is to make the final experience more like writing historical fiction -- only I'm also making up the history. BUT. I'm making it up before I even begin to come up with a story. Or stories.

Apparently, I create characters like I create worlds and systems. I think of archetypes, quirks, and contrasts/relationships. This is all well and good for the outlining process, hence my discovery coming only after the worldbuilding stage, but it makes it difficult to actually start writing simple, continuous scenes in the way you obviously need to for a story, especially because the characters should be the driving force, not the setting.

So my question is this: Do any of you have helpful hints, particular writing prompts, or even personal experiences with this difficulty that might aid me in making the leap from nice, symmetrical, personality-less sets of characters to people worth writing about?

As the dominant race they are working to fill the power vacuum left by the sudden dissolution of the Elgfreyn empire though they only managed to reach any level of accomplishment after the fact and have no personal records of the Elgfreyn empire's dirty deeds - repeating history because they can't learn history, silly humans. Edit: There's a ""blahblahblah"" in there from the sun pantheon only because I never got to write it up before my muse ran off. I'll work on that.

[Doresh](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1bZmTABWC1Jahlr_D_GztvPjNETpc85a2mTpoyhcEREI) - ""beast people"", the second ""mother race"" of the known races. From them descended humans, etcetc. They're split largely between ""domestic"" Doresh and the ""wild folk"" as some of the population have taken to mixing in with the dominant human population and not only adopting new beliefs, but totally annihilating their native culture as well.

[Elgfreyn](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1Tidv66gml_nqIqaT_aW8L5mRm2-NyEf5_DByrpCSJfU) - tall, skinny, pale, and vicious, they're closely related to the Vaarentee, having descended from seven original clans. In their day, they ruled the entire world, building their staggeringly huge and impossible towers in which they made their cities and living, styling their entire culture around the ruling of a lone goddess known only as the Mistress. Violent and terrible, they are well feared if only by word of mouth, though their power has dwindled to a lone tower situated in the northern section of the coast and their aggression has dramatically decreased over the past three hundred years during the rule of their usurper queen/goddess, Aoid.

I've drawn out various maps for my story by hand and even made quite a few on paint that were pretty impressive considering they were done on paint.  
I just got Campaign Cartographer to help me make professional maps and I'm looking for a little practice.  If anyone is interested, PM me and I'll give you my email so you can send me the specs for your map and I'll do my best to create it for you.  
I've never worked with Photoshop but I have extensively with paint and I consider myself a perfectionist.  Because I've never used the software before, I can't promise it will be anything great but I do promise that I will *eventually* get back *something* to you and hey, it's free.  
So if you're interested, just PM me.  If you have any hand-drawn maps you could scan or just rough ideas made in paint, I'll try to stay as true to them as possible.  You can also give me whatever other information you think may be usefully when making the map.

**EDIT:**  
Ok I finished the first map.  It was pretty small and it took me about four days going at my current pace.  The next one might be faster now that I'm at least familiar with the software (I still don't understand it so don't expect perfection).  I was however, happy with the results and though these maps were not made by me, I feel that my first map surpassed these examples in quality:

The third map is pretty close to my abilities but I definitely did the ocean blending better.  
Campaign Cartographer can be used to make really professional maps as well and my goal is to be able to produce something like [this](http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f237/Lord_Tirian/Eberron_Map-Low.jpg) so I still need some practice.  
Quite a few people have expressed their interest but apart from the first completed map, I've only received one other one.  So send me what you got and I'll sort through them and see which of them I'd like to take on next.

Most people would probably stop there and say ""pfft, too sci fi already"", but hear me out!

It's set about 75,000 years in the future, and humanity as we know it is gone. Instead, they've tailored their own evolution to the point of being completely integrated organic/synthetic beings, and are thus immortal. They are so advanced that they are able to interact with all technology and even the physical world through the Void, which is the underlying fabric of the universe. So basically, ***MAGIC!!!***

Humanity basically ruled the galaxy for 50,000 years, but were certainly not alone in the galaxy. Eventually, though, the other races left the galaxy for other galaxies or complete ascension (a la Stargate). So humanity was the only ""old"" race left. They hold sway over pretty much everything, and since they have eliminated the need for projectile weapons, none of the ""younger"" races use them either. Thus, wars are fought with the good ol' ***SWORD AND SHIELD!!!***

I've always thought of fantasy as being an extrapolation of ourselves into civilizations can never exist, whereas sci fi is an extrapolation of ourselves into civilizations than *can* exist or *may have* existed. Who says the line between the two has to be so solid? Truth be told, I want to enter a fantasy-writing contest but don't feel like writing any old ""sword and board"" or ""magic and... stick"" story. I've been working on this idea for many, many years and I want to be sure it's ""fantasy"" enough to enter into a fantasy-based writing contest.

And I came up with one centered on music. While I do play music, I'm not to learned on all this theory stuff, but I was willing to learn for this world I was building.

First off, the magic system. It is indeed based off of music. It starts off as those who have the Spark, that is, people who can influence the world with music through the four elements (and also the mind.) These people can use their voice to make music. They can also create gems to put onto instruments so that instruments can channel magic too. 

The different elements are assigned to different keys.

A, B flat and B all make up the power of earth.
C, D flat and D make up the power of water.
E flat and E influence fire,
F influences mind,
and G flat and G produce air. 

Now, people of the voice can sing in any of these keys and produce this magic, but only if they have the spark. If they create a gem (which is done with several singers, and is very profitable, but a blank gem is required.) they can attach it to an instrument, as I've already said. However, once they attach it to an instrument, say a violin, that violin can play in any key, but will only produce the element the gem is. Therefore, a violin with a fire gem will only produce fire, even if they play in the key of G.

If a musician has the spark and intent, he can make his instrument's element, say fire, behave like another element if he plays in its key. For example, if he plays in the key of C with a fire violin, and he is skilled enough, he can make liquid fire. Otherwise it will just create regular fire. 

Major and Minor also play a role. Major tends to make the positive aspects of an element, while minor tends to make the negative aspects. For example, C major will turn Water into a healing salve if the intent is there. F minor will give someone nightmares or a headache, or even kill them if the musician is skilled enough. (They absolutely need a gem for that though, not even the voice can produce this effect, and in the world, a gem has to have the minor aspect in order for this to happen, so F Minor gems are illegal.) 

Intent and skill also play a role. Unskilled musicians will have their instruments produce wild effects if they do not have mastery over it. They cannot make it do what they want, even if the intent is there. Vice Versa, a man with all the skill in the world but no intent will also not produce the effect. He must want it to happen (this goes along with the balance in music between technique and soul, as some musicians call it.) 

When groups of musicians are together, they can produce wild things, but since the government of my world keeps a very tight grip on this, there is only one large Symphony of musicians with the spark, called the King's Symphony. They are only given gems of water, earth and wind. Fire is occasionally allowed, such as when the Symphony sets out to create a storm, and they use a Minor Fire Gem to create lightening. 

Anyway, the world itself, or at least the country where everything happens is supposed to be very German (probably because I was in German class.) But I want the entire world to be formed by the Music. Even the language and names of places have a musicality to them (if you don't think German is a musical language, then shut up. :P)

I watched videos with Brandon Sanderson who explains what he considers great laws for magic and tried to merge those idea with my world.

This is what I came up with:


My world is split in half. A spiritworld and a physicalworld. The physical world is a world ruled by the sun. The plants get energy from the sun and the entire cycle of life is based around this. 

The Spiritworld is a world of the Moon. The Moon is nothing more than a cold dark rock in the physicalworld but in the spiritworld it is a source of energy similar to the sun. This energy is magic. 

Souls are the invisible magic in the physical world. While the energy of the sun makes things grow an thrive it is the soul that creates the personality of people. People theorized that each soul is bound with an element. 

If a human is intelligent but with a hunger to become smarter
and more powerful he has a Firesoul. This also ties with one of the 4 great Gods: Power.

If a human is passionate and caring, he has an Airsoul. And is tied to the God: Love.

If a human is tied with nature, is a very openminded person and cares about everything living. He is a Watersoul and is tied with: Life.

And if a person is loyal, rational but rather cold. He is an earthsoul and tied with the God: Death.

Ofcourse every being has a combination of these 4 aspects in them. But one usually dominates the other.

Some people are capable of accessing this force: their soul. To perform magic. This magic will be significantly stronger with the element they are connected with. 

A number of mages are also capable of accessing magic from the Spiritworld; They can use the souls of people or animals that have died to perform amazing magic. Souls without a body degrade over time becoming less human and more violent but also more powerful. So the more powerful the soul the mage absorbs the more dangerous it is. They risk a change in personality, having vivid memories from the soul they absorbed, multiple personalities and in the case of very violent and old souls: madness or worse. 

This magic is based on the moon. Just like the tides the spiritworld moves with the physical world being the closest on a full moon. This makes it easier for mages to access the spiritworld and sometimes causes spirits to pass through. 

The more magic a mage uses, from their own soul, the more damaged a soul becomes. And the faster it will degrade once it is without a body.

It was a dark night, one only spoken of in legends, a Crimson Moon filling the sky. Two forces who, throughout time, had met time and again. This night was different, this night was different for even Luna was weeping tears of blood, it was the final time these two would meet.

 

In a field of desolation these two would clash, a living nightmare, a blot of absolution upon the threads of fate for all to exist after this titanic moment in the flow of time. Those few who knew about it had felt that perhaps it would destroy all creation as we know it, others, more levelheaded of course, knew it would change the fabric of creation, nothing could un-weave it.

 

It seemed a sudden ripple, the most minuscule of movements, yet it was enough to start this moment. One force Standing for what common men would call ""Good"". The other stood for the only logical choice in a confrontation such as this, ""Evil"". The flash of steel, the crackling sound of energy echoing around the warriors, the whispers of names, lending power to the attacks as each was launched. ""Chaos Core"", ""Devastating Crush"", ""Soul Ripper"", ""Rezan Burst"".

The story is a bit of a weird west concept, sort of cowboys and mages. I was working on the world's magic system and needed help with my idea.

My idea right now is that when someone chooses to become a magi, they sacrifice a tiny bit of their humanity and trap it in an object (a ring, a cane, even a pocket watch). They can then draw on the power of that bit of their soul to cast spells. The bit of their soul has a set amount of energy and requires time to recharge, so each day the magi in question has limited energy to draw on. The more of their soul they sacrifice, the larger their pool of energy, but the less human they are. The more of their soul they sacrifice, the more their appearance and personality changes. Those who sacrifice their whole soul look like Nosferatu-esque vampires and can't stand the presence of light. Those who sacrificed a smaller part might look a tad feyish or have animal-like tendencies.

My qualifications are that I like to read a lot, am familiar with the genre (and its cliches), and I am good at giving hard yet constructive critique, thanks to experience in art school and writing workshops. Plus, I write myself.


If you'd like, PM me with a link to 2-5 pages of original work, and I will get back to you with at least a paragraph worth of individual critique within a week. The amount of critique I offer will depend on the quality of your work (better = more), how much you offer me, and the level of your craft, so to speak. If you are a beginner, I won't give you a savage deconstruction, just a firm nudge in the right direction. And if you like what you get, we can always talk about going further.

To simplify, there are two main cities where the action is split between.  Certain characters need to go from one to the other a few times.  However, the cities are decently far apart (a few hundred miles, all by land).

This brings me to a narrative problem: it just doesn't feel natural to make make my characters go back and forth.  It's starting to feel like I'm planning an elaborate fetch quest.  It is, however, essential that a few characters are able to travel, while others stay in the area (and sometimes these groups of characters switch who travels/stays).

The Divine Mother couldn’t have screwed them over any better if She’d tried.

One was a factory worker, struggling to make a fresh life for her daughter in a land crippled by war.  The other was a politician, enslaved to his desk with half the world under his boot.  Between them, a soldier, fighting an old enemy he knew better than his own heart.

Theirs was a world soaked in gore and marred by ash.  After decades of conflict, an uneasy peace was finally within grasp.  But no sooner were the old hates burning out when a new force appeared to fan the flames.  This one city—a city on the river, shamed in the past and haunted in the present—would be the powderkeg.  The mother, drawn by hope.  

They would be its saviors.  The politician, baited by peace.  The soldier, always following orders.  They all came seeking different fortunes, never realizing theirs were destinies meant to fail.  Snuffed out by a murderer’s blade.  Crushed by his opponent’s words.  Dead in the streets.  The powers that be had taken careful steps, insuring they would never be allowed to meet.  Their plans for the human race depended on it.

Alone, they will perish. But if these three can survive where fate itself had decried they must die, they will establish a collision of events that will soon count the world as they know it among the casualties.

BLOOD OF MY BLOOD is a contemporary fantasy with a unique magic system in the fashion of David Farland’s The Runelords.  It is complete at 154,000 words, with strong potential for expansion.

EDIT2: Everyone, thanks for your feedback!  This subreddit is just amazing!

EDIT3: I just wanted to thank all of you again for all your amazing feedback over the last two days.  I've got eight different query letters to consider now, but I think that's a task I'll have to leave up for myself.  Since I don't wanna leave you guys on a cliffhanger, here's my personal favorite so far:

&gt;Theirs was a story bound for the grave.

&gt;A mother, struggling for a fresh start and hunted by a monster’s obsessions.  A politician, enslaved to his desk and doomed to defeat at the height of his career.  A band of brothers, trained to fight and destined for death wherever they went.  Alone they would perish, but together their ideals could spark a collision of events that would soon count the world as they knew it among the casualties.  For that, the powers that be would go to any lengths to keep them apart.  

&gt;Krelstan was the shining flaw in their scheme.  A city on the river, shamed in the past and haunted in the present, with countless lures for the desperate.  What fate conspired to keep apart, Krelstan drew like a warm fire on a wet night.

&gt;A shame no one could see the powderkeg lurking just below the surface.

The rain continued to pour. Coupled with the tossing waves and the resultant sea-mist, the air itself seemed drenched with water. Aslinrir examined his bow – it was damp. A limp string and a sodden bow would make it impossible to shoot properly. 

At the helm of the boat stood Sigar. He had the ever-serious disposition and atmosphere of authority that automatically confirmed his militant outlook. “Draw your swords,” he barked as the boat neared the beach, “Swordsmen, keep the left flank; hug the dune-line.

At the helm of the boat stood a grim-faced man. “Draw your swords,” he barked as the boat neared the beach, “Swordsmen, keep the left flank; hug the dune-line. Understand? Spearmen, the king’s banner. Archers, follow me – we take the centre. Helmets!”

The wooden longboat glided through the water, its sides encrusted with barnacles and salt and dragging a colossal amount of seaweed. Through the helmets of the soldiers in front, Aslinrir saw the landing-place: littered with horned rocks, it created an irrefutable air of dominance. To his right was Morcar de Idalion – his chin lined with short, brown stubble and face drawn with concentration. Or perhaps it was anxiety. Either way, it was clear that Morcar was locked in his place with an icy rigidity. ‘It’ll be okay,’ Aslinrir told himself, ‘You’ll be alright.’

The wooden craft slammed onto the shore. Along the coast, several hundred other rafts impacted onto the shingle, each boat laden with soldiers and the red-green standards of Idalion. Enduring the deafening sound of the vessel being thrown against the dunes, the Templars pushed forward a slab of wood at the front of the boat, bridging the gap between the longship and the beach. Aslinrir noticed he was trembling. Whether it was through fear or panic, he did not know. ‘Remember what they told you,’ he thought to himself, ‘Back in the academy. Just get out of there. If they enemy gets too close, get out of there.’He scrambled out of the boat. The heavy footsteps of the Templars on the dunes sent scree skittering backwards.

From atop the dunes, Aslinrir gaped. Amid smoke and flame, the ringed city of Morgiath arose: a three-tiered fortress, built of dark rock, its back to a great range of mountains behind. The lowest levels were lined with bastions, which jutted out from the sheer precipice of the wall. A wide iron doorway, flanked by watch-towers, lead into the city.  

The ground was thick with grey ash; several fires burned sporadically across the heath, cloaking the land with smog. This was the Burning Vale, or Urshilaku.

Marcus Apple, Apprentice alchemist popped a spot on his chin only to regret it instantly as he felt the pus dribble through his fingers. He wished he could be rid of this nervous response as much as he wished that the beard that he had started to grow out six weeks ago would make him look older. Instead he looked even more like a gangly youth than a esteemed man of learning. Right now he wished that he didn't have to go down to the old docks and deliver a message from his master. His red academic robes marked him as an outsider to the fishwives, urchins and longshormen that populated the slum alleys that made up the oldest and least salubrious part of Freeport. Trying not to notice the street hawkers, he hurried along to the dockside city guard house. There were such places scatted throughout the city but he had been called on to go to the most active guardhouse in the worst place he knew of. On reflection Marcus  thought that there might be worse places still that he didn’t know about yet and found himself wishing he was back on the farm. 

Being a farmer was not a worthy profession in the eyes of an ambitious woman. Marring a farmer was all well and good, but Mrs Apple was determined for her children to leave for the bright lights of Freeport. Much to Marcus's chagrin he had been sent instead of his elder brother or sister. While his brother a man of rippling muscles and broad shoulders could work the farm like a shire-horse. Marcus was renown as a lanky beanpole who could scarcely lift a bushel of fruit.   His older sister was too an asset to the farm, a striking beauty who could flirt her way to the best deals from the marketplace, and get the barge sailors to pay half as much again for supplies as they made their way downriver past the family smallholding. It was clear who his father would relent to the nagging about going to join the broad middle class of the greatest city in the world. Marcus's only ambition was to remain at home, and set to prove his worth by cataloguing the herbs, tending the stills and fermenting vats and designing better tools. His efforts backfired spectacularly, winning him a scholarship to study in the renowned college of alchemists.

Still he supposed, once he could claim the chain of a master alchemist he could come and go as he pleased. Until then he would be happy to be able to make it home to the college without the fishy stench of the docks clinging to him and attracting a heard of mewling stray cats. Like on the last two humiliating occasions he had been sent to the waterfront.
 
The guardhouse was set near the waterfront by a jetty used for the smaller fishing boats. It stood out from the surrounding buildings as its yellow-red stone was not crowded with rickety wooden lean to stalls, stacks of traps and great fronds of netting. It also stood out because of two burly guardsmen, eye-balling passers by pikes in hand daring any miscreant to make their day. Marcus nodded to them nervously, they nodded back with scarcely contained contempt. 

The captain of the guardhouse had not shaved yet and his fresh stubble was still longer than Marcus's wispy efforts. Leaning back in his chair he stared down the gangly youth sitting on the other side of his desk before sighing deeply. 'We don’t get many alchemists down here, especially not on official business. What do you want?'. 

Marcus pulled an earthenware pint pot from his robes. 'I bring you a fresh supply of essence of grubroot, add two drops to a glass of water and the solution will change colour depending on the nature of any ink scraped into it. It is of great importance in the detecting of forged documents'. 

The captain of the guard stood up and handled the cork stoppered bottle. 'We don’t get many forgers in the old docks, people have a more direct attitude to theft in these parts. In any case I don’t hold with magic'.

'its not magic sir' stuttered Marcus, 'the change is a simple matter of basic transmutive alchemical principals..' Marcus trailed off under the Captains blank gaze. 

The captain smiled, in any case I always stand by a fair confession' purposely setting his truncheon on the desk with a solid thump. 'Tell me you didn't come all this way just to drop off a jug of potion, what’s your true mission?'. 

'To serve a writ' Marcus pulled a folded document from his sleeve 'I am to recruit two able persons to leave immediately on a mission of trade to the Qulatharen Empire'. 

The captain brightened 'Well this is a fine start to the new year, two whole less scum to deal with'. 

Marcus coughed nervously. 'There is one condition, they cannot be Mammonian citizens '. 

The captain laughed 'god be good, this gets better and better. Come I have two likely candidates who aren't going anywhere right now'.
 
The cells where situated underground, so that in the event of a riot sluices could flood the basement of the guard house with water. Light came only from the scattered light wells in the sealing, the captains torch cut a swathe through the creeping shadows. 'Picked these up the other night in a tavern brawl, be glad to be shot of them'. Swinging to the left the captain unlocked a barred door and stepped inside. 

Marcus had been expecting..well he hadn't been expecting anything yet the figure sitting chained to the wall still managed to surprise him. Her dirty blonde hair was tied back in a short ponytail and she wore the leather trousers and fur lined jerkin that instantly marked her as hailing from the far north. 'Seen enough, or do you want to gawp some more merchant?' she growled.
 
'I'm not a merchant, I'm an alchemist. My name is M Marcus'.
 
'Nina, daughter of Wulfrieda. What do you want?'. 

Brandishing a piece of paper Marcus began 'I have a proposition of great significance'. 

Nina shook her head 'papers? I don’t trust paper, the only reason for paper is to trick  and confuse. You say one thing and the paper says another'. Nina spat on the floor 'if its fancy words your after talk to the queer'. 

A second figure who had been concealed utterly in the dark corner of the cell crawled forwards on his knees. Unlike the Northerners simple garb, this person had taken great effort with his appearance. His clothes were finer and his hair and neat goatee were cut to give a rakish appearance. An effect that was somewhat spoiled by a set of heavy iron manacles around his wrists, dirty straw from the floor all over his body and a shiny black eye covering half his face. 'You called, barbarian?' he half sang in a cheerful voice. 

Snatching the paper from Marcus's fingers the guard captain passed it to the kneeling prisoner. 'well what do you make of it?' he said through his shark like grin.

'The name is Steveo if it pleases you, but as a Thespian and maker of music I can take on many roles' was his cheerful reply. Looking down Steveo glanced at the paper, 'oh-ho,  it appears we have been offered a conditional pardon. All charges dropped if we agree to accompany some fellows on a trek to a far off land'. 

Nina looked up 'what kind of trek and where to?'. 

Marcus replied 'The empire of Qulathar, you depart at once to seek out new trade opportunity. Once the mission is over you will be free to go where you please'. 

Nina spat on the floor again 'Fine, you wont find me in this accused city again'.
 
'Chance would be a fine thing. Well Mr alchemist it appears you have your volunteers' The Capitan of the guard said while sorting through a ring of keys to unlock the prisoners bindings. Steveo and Nina were marched ahead of the captain along the dank passageway that connected the cells and up the stone steps to freedom. with Marcus following behind with the torch trying not to look in the other cells. 

At the front desk of the guard house, two guardsmen were scurrying about with cardboard boxes digging out the possessions of the newly free pair. They ticked off lists itemising possessions confiscated on arrest, with the brusk resentment of someone who has already spent the pawnbrokers fees for said items ten times over in their head. This was lost on Marcus who was innocent in the ways of justice.

He watched impatiently as Steveo and Nina gathered their things. Steveo had more possessions by far, a book of poetry, lyre, pan pipes and a satchel containing a change of clothes and money. Nina had just a small purse in addition to a bear skin cloak and a large broadsword. She passed the time waiting for Steveo by signing the release form with a crude drawing of a penis breaking the quill in the process. 

The captain left them with a bald guardsman with a dented breastplate covering his girth. He loomed large over Marcus and Steveo but saw eye to eye with Nina who when stood up was a few inches over six feet. Brandishing a length of rope the guard looked the strange party over 'do I have to tie you like livestock or are you quick learners?'. 

Steveo spoke up 'fairly quick I should say, what with your club and all'. 

The guard grinned revealing a mouth full of blackened and missing teeth, holding his thick truncheon banded with heavy iron. 'Well done mister bard, this here is for very slow learners.'  They set off with Marcus leading the way, wishing for all the world for this whole nasty errand to be over.

Not too long ~850 words.",Ufomba,9,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1e63zp/first_scene_of_a_dd_screenwrite_just_looking_for/,"Two men hobble down a hillside in tattered clothing. It is twilight with the sun setting behind them. One man, about 30, is supporting his older companion. Their bodies are bloodied and torn, but the two are in good physical shape. As they get to the bottom of the hill, the older man cries out in pain and the two collapse. An arrow is stuck deep in his thigh.

Travant

Those... shameless bastards..

Travant tries to croak out another word but shudders and falls silent. His companion rolls him over gently on his back, then stands looking towards the top of the hill. He turns back towards Travant inspecting his wound. An arrow has sunk completely through Travant's thigh. His companion snaps the flight off the arrow, grasps the head, and pulls the shaft clean through. Travant stifles a gasp by thrusting a fist in his mouth.

Timbers

We need to keep moving. They'll notice the captain and first mate missing from the death toll.

TRAVANT

'Aye they shall. Help me up.

Timbers gives him a hand up, and supporting his shoulder the two hobble away from the hill.

TRAVANT

Where in the seven hells are our bastards? They shoulda' been there tonight.

TIMBERS

They were probably jumped as we were. The so called righteous kingdom of Tyber didn't take long to stab us in the back.

Travant spits at the mention of Tyber. His distaste for the Kingdom and orderly law apparent on his expression.

TRAVANT

I'll gut that cleric yet. The so-called high preist, his entrails will splinter just as my ship did tonight.

Timbers glances at his captain with worry on his face. After a beat.

TIMBERS

We will yet, but for that we'd need an entire crew. You saw the amount of men at his command.

Heavy foot falls are heard from behind the two men as a different individual clumps down the hill the two just departed from. The figure is huge. 10 feet tall at least and massive in muscle. He bounds down the 40 foot hill in several huge steps.

TRAVANT

Well I'll be damned, ain't that a pretty sight.

Travant smiles as the huge lummox sights the two of them a lets out a joyous hoot. In a few large strides he meets up with the two of them.

Mudge

Mudge is happy to find friends. Mudge thought all his friends were dead.

The two attempt to back away but the massive orc-giant scoops the two of them up, one in each arm, and squeezes the frimly as they sputter and choke. Mudge then sets the two down and eyes them warily, looking around as if to make sure no one was eavesdropping, he whispers.

MUDGE

Mudge believes that our new friends were lying to us. Mudge had to kill many new friends to run away from the party. It was not his fault, they wanted to hurt Mudge.

Mudge looks at them pleadingly hoping they will not fault him. They finally get a good look at the Creature. His bruttish face is scarred and twisted from many fights, his body has many small cuts and slashes but he does not seem to mind them. He is clad in heavy pads sewn into burlap trousers and long-sleeve shirt. Mudge hunkers over them worriedly.

TRAVANT

O' trust us, we believe you Mudge. A few of those traitors lost a pint or two on the tip of my blade as well.

TIMBERS

I split a few skulls myself.

MUDGE

So Mudge is not in trouble?

Timbers hefts his one handed boarding axe grinning. Travant clasps Mudge on the wrist.

TRAVANT

No lad, you aren't in any trouble. Do you mind giving an old man a hand?

Mudge shakes his head and hoists Travant up as if he were a child. Timbers continues to stare at the hill as the sun sets.

TIMBERS

Lets get moving again. I hear there is a lake to the east. We should try and get there before morn. Did you see anyone else Mudge?

Mudge nods.

TRAVANT

Well speak up ya pack mule, who was it?

MUDGE

Mudge saw Rast and his friend that does not like Mudge. They led Mudge out of battle. Told Mudge to run and then left him to go fight more. Mudge wanted to go with them! But Rast got angry at Mudge.

TIMBERS

So those two may still be alive, its no suprise, the two are 4 times the fighters we are.

TRAVANT

Aye' that they are. Did they tell you anythin else?

Mudge nods again.

TRAVANT

Well ya overgrown oxen, what was it?

MUDGE

Mudge... Mudge cannot remember. Mudge is sorry! But he cannot remember what he was told.

Travant and Timbers exchange glances.

TIMBERS

Well in that case we ought to continue on to the lake, and see what we can do. I don't know how long the journey is, but its the only landmark on these rolling plains for miles, and we need cover soon.

Timbers sets off east and Mudge follows behind carrying a wincing Travant in his arms. The backs of the three dissapear over another hill.

(3278 words),J_Webb,8,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1dxfqc/critique_link_in_text_realismbased_fantasy/,"I am looking for community critique to accompany the revised first two portions of my fantasy setting's first chapter. I am aiming on creating a realism grounded fantasy setting rich in politics. Before going into the text provided, here are a few bullet points concerning the setting. These will be introduced when needed within the context of the story. However, for clarity here, I will include these notes. 

* The United Kingdoms of Lyon is an unification of thirty kingdoms spread out over a single continent comprised of two island sections, North Lyon and South Lyon. Together, they form the continent of Lyon. These kingdoms were binding together under the first High King. 

* The highest form of government in The United Kingdoms of Lyon has three equal bodies: The High Crown and the Confederacies, the Mayflower Concord, and the officially recognized church of the kingdoms, the Church of the Sacred Father of Lyon. Each are there as a check and balance for the other body. 

* The Mayflower Concord is comprised of five equal parts: The Parliament of Lords, The Parliament of Commons, The Parliament of Nobles, the Senate of According Representation, and The Parliament of Elected Representation. Each of these bodies normally juridic themselves, but very rarely to they convene together at once. When they do, it often results in major political shifts among the United Kingdoms governing. The last time it occurred, it shifted from a majority leftist (left-palm) favor to a majority right-wing (right-palm) favor. 

* Under the High King, five Confederate Wardens are given control over their region of Lyon. Each Warden watches over six kingdoms. The Mayflower of the United Kingdoms is a symbol reference to these highly important political figures.

* In the current year of 1487, the United Kingdoms of Lyon is in severe debt. On top of that, a particularly harsh winter is creeping forward. The people are grasping at straws attempting to prevent a devastating winter.

1367447598.0,7,self.fantasywriters,1difwy,On genders with different races [very quick and stupid question...],Farris11,8,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1difwy/on_genders_with_different_races_very_quick_and/,"So in my story, I have another race, other than humans. For humans, I refer to them as men and women. Even though the other race, the simians, are made of males and females, would it be unusual to refer to them as men and women too? Thinking of other examples, I couldn't picture Tolkien refer to male elfs as ""men"", at all.

Is this the case for your stories? Would you make up entirely new terms, like men and women, or would you keep on referring to them as female elves, male dwarves, etc?

EDIT: Thanks for all the suggestions! A few points. My race do not have their own language, and are distinguishable between genders. The part I was having trouble with was the first lines of the following: 

&gt; *Ah, a smart one!* thought Farris, sneering as he turned to face the female simian. *The Crown would do well to hire you as an agent in their ranks.* She was short for a simian, though still quite taller than a female human. She was pretty enough, though her body was quite as supple Farris’ typical mates. Still, her smile was captivating, and her teeth strong and straight. They would have been perfect, if they hadn't been stained sallow from what Farris supposed was years of bacum smoke. *This is one who spends most of her time amongst drunkards and sots.*

The POV is simian too. I was spending a long time trying to rewrite that line, to remove the double usage of female and simian. I wasn't sure whether I should just go with ""woman"" or make up a new name (simianne maybe?).  This is early on in the second, simian dominated part of the story, and figured it would be a problem I'll be coming up against over and over.

For the audience to experience the deluge of emotion that comes from the characters' goal fulfillment as well as plot resolution, we'll need a few things.


* Act 0 --from the David Siegel's [Nine Act structure](http://fmwriters.com/Visionback/Issue%2015/websitereview.htm), ie. the backstory is going to be essential to the resolution of the current story.

* A resolution that contains the fulfillment of the [Internal Goal](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2011/06/12/writing-excuses-6-2-internal-motivations/), [External Goal](http://www.wordplayer.com/columns/wp30.The.Task.html) and overcoming the antagonist.

* The Interactivity of the elements of Plot, Setting and Characters -- [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=GCZh0Lx7oWo#t=60s) but I recommend watching and working through the entire video series.

* Brandon Sanderson's [First Law of Magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=g3WLmochDMs#t=131s) -- the author's ability to satisfactorily resolve a plot point using magic is directly proportional to the reader's understanding of the magic system.

* Patricia Wrede's [Worldbuilding Questions](http://www.sfwa.org/2009/08/fantasy-worldbuilding-questions/).  A must-have for all genre writers.

**Setting**

The setting is alternate 1912, in the sky-city of Columbia -- a seemingly utopian society with a dark origin and undercurrents of racism and classism.  By working through Wrede's worldbuilding questions, we can establish the required details.

**Characters**

* Booker (the protagonist, hero character and player character)
* Elizabeth (the [relationship character](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2011/10/02/writing-excuses-6-18-hollywood-formula/) and occasional antagonist)
* Comstock (the main antagonist and villain)
* Fitzgerald (a character who embodies a concept and faction in the Setting and also partial antagonist)
* Rosalind and Robert Lutece (inciting incident and backstory characters).

For those who are not aware, there's a difference between the protagonist, hero, antagonist and villain, but that's probably something for another day (since it's not a distinction that's important in this story).

**Plot**

Booker is a private investigator/contractor and sent to rescue Elizabeth from Columbia.  More elaboration below since reconstructing the Plot is our goal here.

**Starting from scratch**

If this had been me, I'd have probably come up with the setting and a couple characters first from random inspiration.  A lot of writing advice supports the idea that the writer should keep [pushing the envelope](http://www.wordplayer.com/forums/forulttrs/lt10.Pushing.the.Envelope.html) and [don't be timid](http://writerunboxed.com/2007/04/24/on-timidity/).  After this initial inspiration, we'd need to keep going, see how everything interconnects and how it's resolved.

**Interactivity of Plot, Characters and Setting (and some Act zero/backstory)**

This is where we brainstorm a bunch of ideas and weave things together.

Elizabeth (Character) has the ability to create tears in the fabric of space-time, seeing and (later) entering other universes in the multiverse.  She is dangerous, so is locked up in Monument Island in Columbia (Setting).  Her ability should have a cost associated with it, but we can get to that later, once more details are nailed down.

Now we have the concept of the multiverse, so does that mean there is scientific investigation into that? (especially considering that Columbia is flying under technological prowess, rather than magic).  Yes -- let's create a Character, Rosalind Lutece, who's a brilliant scientist and discovered the multiverse.  She was also responsible for the technology behind Columbia's flight.  (Character interacting with Setting and establishing backstory)

Booker, our protagonist, has been sent to rescue Elizabeth.  His entry into Columbia is where we can establish the initial conditions of the Setting, as well as place foreshadowing and other hints.  We can't do much more here, without some other details first.

Comstock is the overarching antagonist.  His image recurs throughout Columbia as a Saviour alongside jingoist American propaganda using the Founding fathers.  Shortly into Booker's arrival into Columbia, the racist nature of Columbia's utopia is revealed to the player.  Now we have a bit of history to fill out for Comstock (he previously fought in various battles against Native Americans and also took part in putting down the Boxer Rebellion).

Since Columbia is a racist and classist society, it will make sense to create another character to embody opposition to Comstock's ideals -- Daisy Fitzgerald  (Character and Worldbuilding questions).  The player's interaction with Fitzgerald also provides a mid-story development.  (This would be Act 2a/2b in the Hollywood structure, or Act 5 and 6 in the Nine Act structure).  Ultimately, though, the Fitzgerald portion of the plot serves as a vector to establish more backstory for Booker, Elizabeth and Columbia.  The development of Fitzgerald will also alter the Setting.

At this point, we probably have an idea about the ending, if it hadn't already been thought of.  So, let's say we know the ending but for the sake of conflict, we have to tie Comstock (via the proxy of Columbia) and Booker together -- and we'll do this by intertwining their origins.  (OK, I can't cite this one or remember where I got it from.  It's the notion of never letting the characters walk away.  In James Frey's How to Write a Damn Good Novel, it's the concept of the two sides of the conflict being inseparable until the plot resolution).

There's a split in the multiverse where Booker became Comstock but in others, he stayed as Booker.  Comstock met Lutece, created Columbia, became infertile and decided to steal a baby.  They reach into another universe, Walter Bishop-style, and steal Comstock's baby, where he was still Booker (albeit drunk and heavily in debt).  This baby grows up to become Elizabeth.  At the outset of the story, the reality is that our Booker is sent into a Comstock universe by the Lutece Twins to make things right again (123rd attempt).  All of this information will form the final twist at the end of the story.

Since we now know how we want to end, we would need to place most, if not all, of the relevant information in the Fitzgerald section.  We find out that Elizabeth's ability creates realities and that people can move between them.   We find out that exposure to these tears prematurely ages characters and renders them infertile ([Magic system must have a cost](http://www.writingexcuses.com/2008/05/18/writing-excuses-episode-15-costs-and-ramifications-of-magic/)).  Now, we have two concepts which we can go back and apply to our characters and backstory.

**Fleshing out backstory**

Backstory (Act zero) drives the entire story.  What is defined in the backstory makes the resolution of the story inevitable, that is, if the writer follows the resolution thematically as well as characteristically.

In regular notions of the multiverse, all choices and possibilities exist. If Elizabeth can travel between them at will, we need some history and reasons.

We already have a genius, Rosalind Lutece, so let's say that she was the one who originally tore through space-time into other universes.  We can also add in Robert Lutece,  ie. if Rosalind discovered the multiverse, then it would make sense that she would encounter another version of herself as Robert.  This adds a dialog counterpoint for Rosalind.  Through flashbacks, we can establish that the Lutece Twins were the ones who sent Booker to Columbia, in an effort to right their own wrongs (being involved in Elizabeth/Anna's kidnapping in the first place).  We can place the Lutece Twins throughout the story, adding questions for the audience/player and a sense of mystery regarding their identity and motivations that is solved in the final act.

Comstock, having been in long contact with the technology that keeps Columbia flying is old and infertile.  But he needs an heir, someone to take over when he dies.  He needs a baby to raise as his own and brainwash.

There's a bunch more backstory but we can start putting all of this into a narrative structure.

**Nine Act Structure**

I'm only taking a guess that this structure was used but Infinite also fits nicely into the Hollywood 4 Act structure.  I removed the descriptions of each Act to fit into the posting limit, so follow along with each Act [here](http://fmwriters.com/Visionback/Issue%2015/websitereview.htm).

Here we go:

Act Zero (flashback and forces in motion) - *Voxaphones and the pivotal scenes from this portion are shown in the final act/denouement*.

Act One (establishing shots) - *Booker's entry into Columbia, walking through the city and the fair.*

Act Two (hook and conflict) - *From the moment of throwing the ball either at the interracial couple or the announcer, getting chased to Monument Island*

Act Three (introduction to characters and plot dev) - *Seeing the underside of Columbia, the racism, Comstock's influence, and of course, meeting Elizabeth*.

Act Four (committing to first goal) - *Booker commits to getting Elizabeth to the Airship, even if he lied about taking her to Paris*

Act Five (the wrong goal) - *This is the Slate and Fitzgerald portion of the game, which also circles back to change the Setting*.

Act Six (the new goal) - *Booker and Elizabeth head to Comstock House.*

Act Seven (all does not go well) - *Elizabeth is captured but Booker rescues her.  The extent of her tearing ability is shown.  They take over the Airship and destroy the Monument*

Act Eight (the end)  - *After the destruction of the Monument, Elizabeth's powers are fully realised.  She is able to show Booker the truth of her origin, as well as his memories from his true universe.  Ends with a final twist that fulfills Booker's internal goal (saving Elizabeth from a life of imprisonment), external goal (the onscreen task is getting drowned by Elizabeth at the point where the multiverse splits into versions that have Comstock) and defeating the antagonist (stopping Comstock's origins).  All of this is made possible because we now understand the nature of the multiverse Setting and the abilities of Elizabeth and the Lutece twins (Sanderson's First Law of Magic)*

Now that the backbone is established, we can dig a bit deeper and also layer more information and subplots into the story.

eg. red herrings about Booker's mantra ""paying off the debt"".  At first blush, it seems to be the driving force for his current job, but in reality refers to his past and the origins of Elizabeth.

I'd also add in the Lutece Twin appearances at this point, since we now know everything about them and can refine the details. 

**Some final notes**

I've skimmed over the techniques used to inject all of the required information without info-dumping.  There are already a lot of resources on that available, so I'll summarise by saying that it's done by making every part of the story essential.  An example is the Slate portion of the game.

On the surface, it just seems to be a superficial Settings lesson about how Comstock is glorifying and fictionalising his part in these conflicts and how Slate is another person opposed to Comstock, like Fitzgerald.  This all might seem like thumping the player over the head with Comstock's arrogance and his reliance on propaganda to advance his jingoistic ideals but this portion of the game holds important information and foreshadowing.

* Comstock was at Wounded Knee but Slate was sure that he wasn't.  Booker, however, was.

* Comstock is seemingly attempting to rewrite history.  This plays into the concept of his rewriting the history of Elizabeth.

Another example is the Fitzgerald section.  An incredible amount of exposition into the nature of Elizabeth's power, the origin of the Luteces, the multiverse and the origin of Columbia is crammed into the gameplay and the scattered voxaphones.  Yet, it's all done to the background of Fitzgerald's storyline playing out and changing the nature of the Setting.

The other aspect that can't be overemphasised is the quality of the presentation, in this case the gameplay was well done, the acting was top-notch and the direction of the cut-scenes had just the right touch, particularly the ending.  For our medium, this means we need the prose to do all the heavy lifting.  Easier said than done, I know, but all the planning in the world for the greatest story in the world can be undone by bad prose.

I hope this helps some of you and shows some of the processes that I find useful in making a stronger story.  Here are a few more links on endings:

-A magic sword that sits around unused until the hero gets it.

-A damsel in distress is rescued and falls in love with her rescuer.

-An old man randomly meets the heroes and for some reason is wise and helps them, and knows exactly the information that they need to succeed.

-The villain is related to the hero.

-Magical women (witches) use a crystal ball to see an important plot point.

-A quest for one single specific object on which the fate of the world/kingdom rests.

(380 Words),The_Sven,9,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/19su3z/short_short_critique_just_a_story_about/,"And it came that Alorna, the Goddess of the Hunt, of Freedom, and of the Wind looked down upon Man and thought to herself *Look at how unhappy he has become.

That he could be like his brother, the Wolf, and know again what it is to live only being responsible to himself and his kin.* And then a thought occurred to her: *Ah! I shall select two of the people who think they need to be slaves to find their happiness and I will allow them a time when they can be free.*
 
So the next night, she began her search. She looked and found a young couple who were in love but worked so hard that they were not able to enjoy their time together. So, as they slept one night, she took the blood of a wolf and blessed the couple with lycanthropy. Instantly, the couple turned into wolves and found their way to the local forest.
 
Alorna was pleased because she knew that the couple were now happy as they ran together. But as the sun rose in the morning, the couple returned to their human form, and went back to their unhappy lives. The couple began to love their times in the forest but were saddened when they were forced to return to society. So Alorna devised a plan.
 
*I need to send them to a place where they will always be happy. When they can always run free.* She looked up and saw the moon, hanging high above the cities of man. *Ah! I shall send them to the moon, where they will always be in the moonlight as it reflects off the sun. As long as they stay in the daylight on the moon, they will not have to return to their former lives.*
 
And so, Alorna scooped up her creations and placed them on the moon. Where they quickly died. Because there's no atmosphere on the moon and they suffocated. No one ever said the Goddess of the Hunt, Freedom, and the Wind was smart.

Sometimes you don’t understand what you’re being told, until all of a sudden, you have a thousand little cuts, and bang, now you get it, and wasn’t even about cuts. It was always like that for Gunth. It usually took a rock to the head for him to learn, and he’s been hit with a lot of rocks.
  
Growing up, Gunth was bigger and faster than all the other kids and few men even, so he learned early, the threat of violence and fear would put most people on his side, except for Konrad. Gunth thought he knew everything you could possibly want to know back then. He was the strong one who spoke with violence, sharpened steel, with a passion for fighting, be it man to man, army to army, or anything in between. He was an artist of death and carnage.   
 
 Konrad, always quick with a word and a smile, was the clever one. They said he could sell a halo to an angel or a pitchfork to the devil. Gunth wasn’t quite sure what that meant, but he heard it often enough from the women in town.  Everyone thought Gunth was the leader, but it was always Konrad, guiding, suggesting, or demanding if necessary, knowing what lever to pull and button to push, moving the pieces where he saw fit. Gunth only had to see Konrads face, the only thing he ever learned to read, a subtle frown, slight raise of an eyebrow, or a stare, and he knew what needed to be done.

   Not any more thought Gunth. Not since they killed him.
 
 His boots sink ankle deep in the muddy soup with a soft smacking each rising step, as he darts between the gangly Cypress trees covered in a gray moss that casts a gloomy shadow on his already gloomy day. Fortunately rainy season hadn’t come yet or he’d be waist deep in the mire, but that is no comfort now. His legs are numb and his lungs are knives jabbing at his ribs with each breath. Nearing the citrus grove the ground becomes solid, sandy, sticking to his already wet boots making his feet heavy, as the cloying scent from the ripe fruit makes his head light.  

 The power to sustain him on his journey through the swamp is fed by rage. It gives him fuel as it burns in the center of his chest, a furnace fanned by the emptiness of loss, forging his strength and resolve harder than any known metal. There will be more death today, and Gunth will be the instrument as he shows the men who killed his brother what an artist can do.

The meeting was held at the estate of Lewellyn Moxley.  He, being chairman of the Guild, took his place upon the dais to stand before a dozen or so of Alcadia's brightest mages.


The agenda, as was outlined upon a lengthy scroll hung like a banner behind him, called for the apprehension of a certain mage, one Hawthorne the Mad, who had recently gone rogue in search of the lost city of Alphaba.


""Rubbish,"" said the portly mage at Magellyn's left.  Magellyn recognized him at once as Leofold Lindsy, or as some called him, Leo the Lard.


""Pardon?""  Magellyn asked.  It was his first time to attend a meeting of the Guild, and he was not sure how to respond.


The big man rolled his eyes and turned to face the man sitting at his other side.


Magellyn heard him repeat the word and noted the appropriate response.


""Oh, I agree,"" the other man crooned.  ""If Hawthorne wishes to go galavanting off on some quest to a place that, I assure you, does not exist, then who are we to care?""


Satisfied, Leo the Lard grunted his concurrence and turned to face the dais once more.


""Excuse me,"" Magellyn said.  ""Who exactly is this Hawthorne the Mad?""


Leo turned.  ""I'd say the real question is who exactly are you?""


Magellyn erected himself in his chair and offered his hand.  ""I am Magellyn Dalisar of the Arrynt.  Pleased to make your acquaintance.""


Leo frowned down at the hand before him.  ""I say, is that a Glossiper's ring you wear upon your pinky?""


""Indeed it is.  My very first.""


Leo's brows went up.  ""Ah.""


He turned once more to the gentleman at his opposite side.  ""It is worse than I thought.  It seems our precious Guild has been polluted by Glossipers.""


The other mage tittered.  ""Brightest minds in Alcadia, indeed!""


Leo's hand disappeared into a pocket at his breast.  He withdrew a roasted foul wrapped in wax paper and held it to his lips.


Magellyn knew a spell that could cause an object to realign its basic structure into a shape of his choosing.  He thought it might do if he waited for Leo to take a bite, then mutter the charm under his breath so that the chunk would expand greatly, thus lodging itself firm within Leo's throat.


He was preparing the spell in his mind when a voice from the dais said, ""Let us begin.""

World-building continuously cripples me as I'm writing. I always put myself in the mind of my characters, but I end up questioning myself. ""What does this character know about *this* or *that*? What happened to this character's ancestors? Is it possible there are some ""long-lost"" relatives?"" 

Now, obviously, those are examples, I'm not always trying to inject ""long-lost"" character cliches into my story. Personally, I'm thinking I should just sit down and write, and if something comes along that is ""data"" (relevant facts about the world), I should keep notes on all of that.

“All rise for the Lord of Halteen”

The great hall was filled with the sound of clothes rustling as an ageing Lord Oldash walked toward his marble throne, once he was seated his steward, Denlith, spoke “Todays court is now in session.”

Commander Rothyss, clad in gold plated armour minus the helmet came forward and knelt before his lord.

“Rise commander.” Spoke the one eyed Lord.

“I have located and captured the native girl my lord, she is currently being held in the west tower. We also have one less native settlement to deal with, no survivors or prisoners except the girl.” Rothyss smirked.

“You have done well commander, take a fortnights rest then bring the girl to his holiness, Vasaal Damasus in the capital of Entos. This land will be ours soon enough.”

“Thank you my lord, it will be done.” Rothyss bowed before returning to his position among the other military leaders.

“Does anyone else wish an audience with Lord Oldash?” Denlith asked.

“I do sire.” Came a voice from the back of the hall, a farmer approached, hat in hand he knelt before Oldash.

“What is it farmer?” he asked.

“M’lord, I run Greenfayre farm just east of Halteen. My wife and I, we’ve been losing sleep of late. Our crops have all died ‘spite the glorious weather our lord’s blessed us with a-and our sheep and cattle are turning up dead or straight up disappearing. Something evil is lurking near m’lord.”

Oldash laughed and shook his head. “It is but the work of the natives I’m sure, the savages would do anything to have us abandon this great city. Replant your crops, I’ll send guards to look out for natives around your farm.”

“No m’lord, forgive me but this isn’t the work of the natives. We find our livestock as if they’ve had their heads bitten clean off, my boy says he’s seen somethin’ fly to and from Mount Skel and we hear it at night, shrieking an awful shriek.”

A ripple of pretentious laughter flowed through the hall, the farmer clenched his hat and turned to the nobles mocking him.

“It’s real damn it!” he shouted. “And if I’m to be laughed at for trying to do my bit for this city then to hell with you all, my family and I are leaving this godforsaken land, just pray these walls are strong enough.” He turned and gave Oldash the slightest bow before storming out of the hall, muttering profanities under his breath. One of the knights stepped forward to punish the farmer for his insolence.

“Let him go Sir Erick, we need not concern ourselves with mad peasants.” Oldash dismissed, causing another ripple of laughter and the passing of comments.

“Right!” Shouted Oldash. “Does anyone else wish to entertain the court with daft tales of beasts of burden stalking the shadows or can I return to my maidens?”

Denlith leaned toward Oldash. “We have three criminals awaiting sentences, sire.”

“Fine, fine. Bring them in, let’s make it quick.”

The doors to the hall opened and three bound men were escorted in, each with a guard at his back, the first two were Halteen citizens, the third a native whose presence sparked mutterings of slander between the nobles, he and Rothyss shared an electric stare as he passed. Denlith handed Oldash parchment with details of the criminals, which he looked at with subtle disinterest before turning his attention to the accused.

“Fallion Skyhawk.”

Fallion promptly stepped forward. “Lord” he mumbled.

“You say milord when you address your better! Learning a bit of respect might have had you end up in a better position than the one you’re in now” Oldash spat. “You’ve been accused of stealing jewellery from the house of noble Sir Burf. Have you anything to say in your defence?”

Fallion paused and took a look around the hall before replying. “Milord"" He said with the slightest hint of sarcasm. ""Noble Sir Burf has so much jewellery, and I so little gold. If not his jewellery then I would be stealing bread from the baker or meat from the butcher, I felt it my duty to strengthen the local economy by selling our hard working citizens expensive jewels for cheap food. Besides, I made sure to only take the rings that do not fit on his fat fingers anymore.” 

Oldash jumped from his throne “You insolent little shit!” he barked. “You could have walked out of here after having lashes and losing a hand but no, you had to be a clever little bastard didn’t you? You’ll spend a week in the dungeon then you’ll go to the block! I’ll have your head on a pike in this very court as a reminder to anyone else who feels like being a smart-arse. Take him away!”

Fallion forced a smile as he was walked out of the hall, Oldash shook his head and sat back down.

“Dynn Redhand.”

An old man came forward. “Milord.” he said.

“It says here that you have chosen to forsake our saviour and poison my people with the heretic lies of the God of shadows, Ragna.”

“That’s true my lord, only in the shadows will we find salvation.”

“Tell that to Calphanaax when you meet him after you rot in the dungeons, now get this heretic out of my sight!” Commanded Oldash before turning his attention to the native.

“A smart-arse thief, a demon worshipper and now a native, my court has been sullied this day. Do you speak the common tongue, savage? Do you even have a name?”

“My name is Aenna.” He spoke.

“Humph, tell me Ayenna why do your people wear those foolish tattoos across your bodies? Why would anyone with skin that dark want to make it darker?” Oldash was clearly trying to strike a nerve.

Unfazed, Aenna replied “You would not understand, we hold older, more sophisticated traditions than your mistranslated fairytales.”

“Bloody savages dancing in the mud is what you call sophisticated.” Oldash quickly dismissed. “Now what were you doing outside my city, it’s a crime for natives to step on angol land.”

Aenna said nothing.

“Then we’ll have to assume that you’re a spy, you’ll go to the block straight after the thief and I’ll have you’re head on a pike on the city walls so that all your savage cousins will know that this is our land now!”

I have dealt with depression throughout much of my life. Books and video games provided an escape for me, however my own desire to write was repressed by a broken school system for much my life. I once got detention because the essay I wrote diverged too far from the prompt. (""Write a bout a time you showed courage"" and I wrote about being a pilot in world war 2). Consequently, the place where I am at now is quite strange to me. I am in a department which is actively promoting my creativity as a writer. unfortunately, I can only turn in so many things for peer edits and workshops.

That's where you guys come in. I'm new to this subreddit. I subbed just a half hour ago while in Spanish class. I don't really know how this all works, but I'm really looking for a community that will actively and honestly critique my work, as right now my only critic is my older brother. Even though I value his input, it is the input of only one person.

I'll ask that you would critique Valadil's prologue (http://purefantasy.blog.com/2012/09/16/valadil-prologue/), at least for now. I'm not really sure if I'm rambling or not, and I've grown surprisingly nervous about posting over the last few minutes of typing this.

I've started work on an (intended) 5-book series. Of course I realize that's a huge feat, but there's a lot of story to tell.

The problem is, I sit down to write, and then realize ""Oh, I never thought about [insert problem]"". And then I think it through and realize the best answer is to change what I had thought about some character or event. Or maybe ""Does this character's motivation make sense or did I just throw it in there to ease plot points?""

How much of this would typically happen? I can't keep re-writing the chapters I've completed... 

I'm also worried about plot continuity or plot holes... I have set up a back-story (rather large) of my characters and the world's history, and don't want motivations to be unclear in future books when elements come back into play later on.

Does anyone else worry about this? I feel like it's a huge factor in fantasy, especially one that requires a lot of world building and history, or one that is a series of novels.

I have a large outline of my first novel, and about 10k words written, not necessarily consecutive chapters. Then future novels have smaller, very broad outlines. 

I have multi-POVs in my novel and I'm starting to think ""Hmm, does this character even have a valuable arc, is it worth it?"" And similarly, ""Should this character already have some specific knowledge, and does it make sense that they do what they do?"" This leads to me wondering about non-POV character's motivations as well. 

Anyways, at this time I'm just taking turns alternating between writing part of a chapter that I know will fully be there, and outlining some of my minor character's arcs, motivations, etc. Any tips or inspirational ideas?",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_zvrm1,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/zvrm1/how_much_outlining_should_i_do/,

Anyway, let's talk about titles. How do you choose a good title? I know the general advice is usually to look at themes, objects, characters, place names, etc. There are heaps of words that are, perhaps, overused in fantasy novels, like sword, for example. Do you care about your title really standing out from the crowd or not? Do you prefer dramatic-sounding titles? If you're writing a trilogy, do you like all three titles to sound similar (e.g. *Spirit Gate*, *Shadow Gate*, *Traitor Gate*)?

I want to start with a thank you to those of you who encourage me to take sometime off before editing my book. I was prepared to dive right into edited the moment I finished my 2.5 years of writing my first novel. I took a month off (although I know some people would encourage more lol) and did some reading, worked on a short story and read up on good editing practices. I even came up with a couple tweaks to my story that I think will make it much better in the end. So again, thank you to all those who from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/tzet5/finished_writing_my_first_book/) for convincing me to hold off :)

The editing process has been going well so far. In two different editing sessions I have gone through about 40 of 300+ pages of manuscript. I've cut quite a bit of useless (ie wordy) narrative and added some needed details. 

I've been printing out pages and giving them to my wife for her to read through and edit as I finish my edits. She has already gone through the first 16 pages and marked them up like she was a high school English teacher. Which is good because I know I didn't catch everything. One this round of edits is done we will lather, rinse and repeat. 

It feels really good and I'm hopeful that I should have a much improved manuscript by the end of the year. I will continue to edit until I am completely happy. After that... well... I'll just have to wait and see!

Just send me a message on here with the email address you'd like it sent to and when the book is released in April I will send you a free copy as my way of saying thanks for making this such a great community.
To publish this book as an actuall physical copy I've made a Kickstarter page to help fund the printing and shipping costs. If you'd like to know more about the project or how to get a paper back version of the book please visit my page at: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danatoth/necromancer-corruption
I've always loved reading fantasy novels ever since I was a child and have always wanted to actually sit down and write one of my own. This winter I finally sat about to do it and completed my novel, Necromancer: Corruption. I've put a lot of time and spent a lot of long nights writing this book and now my goal is to get it published. Rather than go a traditional route of publication I've decided to go through Kickstarter.
Necromancer: The corruption revolves around the tale of a young elf named Fayne who is set in the book to take the trial of becoming a Keeper of the Equinox. A defender of nature and of his home town Fen'dril. But during his trials his home town is besieged by a necromatic force and his lover is killed.
Fayne is left with one option, to serve a dark master and become a Necromancer to bring his lover back to life. Although Fayne is a kind and gentle being, the dark arts are a very dangerous path. Using its power is the young Elf's only chance at bringing his love back to life, but puts his soul on the edge of corruption.
TL;DR I wrote a full length fantasy novel and am giving it away for free, just message me and you'll get a copy when the book is released in april. Or for a paperback version visit http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danatoth/necromancer-corruption

1325130826.0,9,self.fantasywriters,nuheb,This may be your chance. New collaborative publisher is seeking proposals/queries for fantasy novels. [X-posted from r/fantasy by request],CreativityTheorist,12,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/nuheb/this_may_be_your_chance_new_collaborative/,"(See [original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/nt2ui) For some questions already answered.)

Last winter, I was getting depressed about my inability to attract a traditional publisher and was thinking about trying the self-publishing route when my debut novel was unexpectedly picked up by a new-fangled publishing company in western Canada.

[Indie Ink](http://indieinkpublishing.com/presta) is trying to straddle the growing divide between traditional publishing and self-publishing. The traditional guys pay all the publishing costs in exchange for a thin royalty (5-10%), but they also take over most of the creative control, leaving authors out of the loop on design, title, marketing, etc.

The self publishers are at the other end of the spectrum, giving you 100% of creative control and 100% of the revenue, but they charge you 100% of the production costs, and upsell you on other services like distribution, marketing etc. They can't lose, and you take all the risk.

Indie Ink is trying to balance this equation. Like a traditional publisher, they have an editorial review process, accepting only a fraction of the submissions they get, and they put a lot of money into the production, distribution and marketing side of things. But unlike the traditional guys, Indie thinks book projects work best when both parties have equal skin in the game. So their deal is that the costs should get split between the author and the publisher. And so should the royalties. They aim for a 50/50 split on both, although in practice, projects can end up anywhere between 40/60 and 60/40 once the negotiating dust has settled.

My novel ([Strange Places](http://indieinkpublishing.com/presta/5-fiction)) was Indie's first title in the fiction market - a market they now want to grow beyond just my work. So, being their resident expert on both fantasy and the internet, they've asked me to see if I can generate some quality submissions in the fantasy category. 

That's where you guys come in.

I know there are a bunch of you out there with finished, or near-finished manuscripts in hand. If that's you, and you think the collaborative publishing model is something you'd be interested in exploring, we'd love to see a proposal. We're looking for something new. Something that isn't elves and dwarves, or sparkly vampires, or teen-romance with were-beasts. Remember what fantasy *used* to mean? Fantastical? That's what we're looking for. Hit us with something fantastic.

To do so, send an email to submissions over at indieinkpublishing.com. Just a plain text email, please. No attachments or links to other material. If we like the pitch, we'll ask for that kind of stuff later. Tell us about your story and about yourself as a writer. Make us salivate to see the actual manuscript. And do it in no more than about 600 words.

Let's show the old-school publishers that there's a better way to do this - a way where the authors are treated like business partners instead of children - where everybody gets a say in the product that goes out, and everybody gets a decent chunk of the successes when they happen.

Magical wards designed for this very occurrence kick in and completely close off the school from the outside world.

1376051784.0,6,self.fantasywriters,1k0sth,Plot mechanic help,Takuya813,8,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1k0sth/plot_mechanic_help/,"OK, so instead of just writing my story, I've been attempting to focus on nailing down the beginning, middle, and end of my story first. My major issue is with the main plot mechanic of my story:

When the people (including MC) of this town dream, they end up in a sort-of alternate dimension. It's essentially the same as real life, just... not as real. Most of the people aren't aware of this connection, except the MC, some antags, and a few others. The way it works is that this area is generally a very bleak place with constant turf wars, killing, and chaos, and mostly swords, but maybe guns too. 

The issue I have is with defining this dimension-- whether as magic or science. I think depending on which way I go, the plot is affected in terms of resolution and character development.
***
Science: I was going to explain this via chemicals and drugging (unspecified scientific advance?), with the behind-the-scenes antag being a psychologist who has been drugging everyone including the MC. MC can be aware due being given different drugs (accidentally maybe)

Death: When someone dies, either from a gun or sword or whatever it would actually be some kind of chemical signaling (brain thinks you are dying so it actually kills your cells, and you die)

***

Magic: If I use magic, I just don't know how to flesh out the story. Why does it exist? Do I need to explain it? The antag would still be a doctor-type, but I'm not sure how to tie in their connection to it all. Also, how does my MC become aware of the other dimension? I don't want him to be The Chosen One.

Death: When someone dies here, it's just magic, so they can actually disappear from the real world. More mysterious and such. I was even thinking as to go so far as to have it when someone dies they actually disappear from existence in people's minds too.

With magic, I can do other neat things kind of like Neo in the Matrix ( but one The One... hopefully) where he can end up being awake and accessing the dream-world to kill someone, or something nifty.

***

As you can see, both implementations color the story a bit differently. I'm just not sure if one is inherently better, or more accessible to the reader.

It had been months since she had worn it last, and it was a little snug around the bosom now, a fact that might have made her smile once, before the trip to Old Town.

Slow deep breaths. Slow deep breaths. She stood there a few moments, hunched over, mouth filled with bile. Would that image haunt her forever?

   The sun was setting as the three sailors watched across the horizons silhouette.  Islands shone out of the darkness against a backdrop of gold and crimson.  The wine flowed freely, sour and stench-ed with vinegar, loosening their minds and their tongues.

   ""A month we be sittin' in these waters waiting for a sign of Tristan.  Like as not the slimy fuck left us for a whore and some rum.""

   Bats echoed overhead, screeching as if to add omen to the already dark conversation.

   ""Aye the tides of fortune seems be against us.  But talks no ill will o' the captain.  Eight years I be under Tristan and if he no be dead he'll come back to us.  The mans blood be black as pirate but his honour runs as deep as his marrow.""

   ""Them be no truer words spoken,"" the voice and lantern drifting slowly towards the men.  Dim but encroaching.  Turning their heads they heard the clatter of pistols knocking barrels before the saw the broad shape of the man before them.

   ""Stay easy lads, I'm no here to chastise ye, settle your boots n' mugs.  May be a long time before we gets to drink again.""

   The men had scrambled to their feet, worried their sullied talk had sounded a little *too* against their captain.
   ""Pardon Ben, we's just letting the wine get the best of us.""

   A head and a half above what most consider even tall men, Ben Thomas was as intimidating a figure as any.  His mopped shoulder length hair fell around his hardened face in bronze strands, held in place by years of salt water between the locks.  Raising sail for near two decades had built the man into raw muscle and sinew.  The definition of his chest and back showed a strength that dare not be tested.

   ""True enough lads.  But make no mistake if cap'n no returns our heading is as sure as the sun rise...""
   The lantern drew across his face, illuminating emerald eyes that had taken more life than seen.  Thrown out to sea since his 11th name day.

   ""Where be that Ben?"" All three sailors gazed at the first mate with a passion they had been longing to find for weeks.

   ""To find the man that took him from us.""

   Ben took a pause and started into the darkness as the last rays of sunlight disappeared behind the clouds and night became their only comfort.  With a breath he rubbed the scar running from his right eye to his chin, a scar that had no story and drew a lashing if asked about.

Finally the discomforting silence was broken.

   ""To find the man that took him from us lads... and cut his heart out.""

Longtime reddit lurker, using a newly-minted screenname because I'm beginning to realize that there are cool communities here and a lot of people write and maybe some of you can help me (I've read some of the critiques and you guys are wonderful.) 

I started writing a novel just over a week ago. The idea's been in my head for ~4 years, but I'm temporarily not working so I decided to use the excess of free time to write the damn thing. As it turns out, it's going uncommonly well, and I'm at about 50,000 words. 

It's a YA fantasy, and I'm having a blast working on it, but the problem is that I am almost completely genre-clueless and haven't picked up a pen to write fiction since I was in high school. I've read some of the more popular titles (HP and LotR, then ASoiAF, and just finished the Mistborn books and Name of the Wind) but I don't know much about fantasy and as it turns out, worldbuilding is effing *hard*.

So I was hoping to get some comments on my first chapter!

I know, it's long. You can only read the first scene if you like. I was just hoping to get some notes on: 

1. The general unfolding/layering of information. I've got a lot of backstory planned out, but really just wanted to dive into the meat of the story with Chapter One. Is it confusing? Or am I being too on-the-nose?
2. The creation of the city. I spend a lot of time in the first scene going into detail about what the protag does on the job, but felt like there was important indirect characterization in it. An earlier critique told me that I should have spent more time with direct description of the city, and I know some writers are big fans of the ol' stop-and-explain, but I hate it. Do I need it? 
3. My prose in general. Does it feel bland? I've spent 3 years writing hard news, and I literally don't know what a metaphor is anymore. Some people can make a sentence sparkle like Ed Cullen in a glitter factory, but I can not. 
4. Also, if I am first-person limited, how do I describe my protag without doing a shitty mirror scene? I hate shitty mirror scenes. ",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_1iusno,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1iusno/critique_the_conduits_1_4020/,

[critque] on the first couple of ""chapters""?",,11,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1huiwo/okay_just_started_this_critque_on_the_first/,"So I had this urge to write this story about a school of teenagers that can control the elements. I thought about it for days then I finally started writing it. I have the first five ""chapters"" done. Here it is :3 


Chapter 1

I awoke with a groan as the community alarm clock went off. I was a light sleeper unlike most of the other girls, so I was always up first. I jumped out of bed and stretched my long limbs, then sat on the floor to get my clothes container out from under my bed.


Every girl is given a big plastic tub when they arrive at Danubey's all girls boarding school, to hold your clothes and hygiene things. I pulled mine out and scooped up my shower things into my arms and headed to the showers.


The showers are really just a big room with ten shower heads, five on each side. No walls for privacy, which really sucks for self confidence. That's why I like to get up early and shower, so I don't get bugged about my body, especially about my scars. 


My scars are from my childhood, which wasn't the greatest. My parents were whack jobs and drunks. I'm surprised I didn't come out of the womb a special needs child because of all the drinking my mother did while pregnant.

My parents absolutely despised me. I was three when the target practice started. They would throw empty bottles at me, sometimes they would shatter and cut me, sometimes they would just bounce and leave ugly purple bruises.
    
I was  when my father would hit me in a drunken rage. Slap me across the face, push me down to the ground with shouts of ""stop glowing you retarded child!"" I didn't know if I was really glowing, or if he was drunk and hallucinating. 

 I turned on the shower and let the cold water wash away the bad memories. But no matter how cold the water was they were etched in my brain for life. I finished my shower quickly, listening for sounds of the other girls. I was just putting my bathrobe on when Mindy Andrews walked in, in all her naked glory, short and petite with long dirty blonde hair. 

I averted my eyes and headed towards the exit of the showers. ""Not so fast Tin."" She caught the neckline of my bathrobe and pulled me back in front of her. I looked her in the eye and scowled.

  ""It's Tyne. Like time but with an 'N' sound."" I scowled deeper. 
 
  ""Looks like your in a hurry. Don't want to be seen nude? Have something to hide? Tattoos? Piercing? You can get expelled for things like that you know."" 

 ""You'd like that wouldn't you?"" I smiled and looked her in the eyes. ""Daddy would take away your allowance if he found out about that butterfly wouldn't he?"" The look in her eyes was priceless. She shouldn't be so surprised that I knew, everyone knew about the butterfly tattoo on her hip. She was practically a nudist, prancing around in her birthday suit. 
     
 But of course no one would report her. Her dad practically owned the school, a top donor,  and she could get you kicked out with one pouty lip. Mindy had let go of my robe so I headed for the door. ""See you at breakfast, Mindy!"" And with that, I left. 

~~~~~~

Breakfast was the usual. I sat at my table, alone, reading my biology textbook because we had a test that day. Not that I needed to study, I was just bored. I had read all the good books in the library and all the ones in my personal stash 2 or 3 times already. I should go into the bookstore in town and get more sometime soon. 

 I absentmindedly took a bite of my cream cheese bagel and went back to reading about evolution and Charles Darwin when a shadow loomed over my table. I looked up into the face of Mrs. Wichel, the school's headmaster. With her gray hair pulled into a tight bun on top of her head and jewel rimed glasses she looked like she could be a kind grandmother that bakes you cookies when you visit. But I knew that she was far from a cookie baking granny. 

""You are to report to my office after your classes."" She scowled and then added ""you will have a visitor."" After she scowled at me some more she turned around and walked away to bark at another unfortunate girl.

*Who would visit me?* I wondered. I didn't have any family left, at least none that would give a crap where or who I am.

  In my state of befuddlement I didn't notice Mindy come up to my table. I jumped as she sat down with a thud. She glared at me before asking, ""Why are you studying? You're going to ace the test anyway.""

 ""I'm bored. I have no one to converse with in this miserable school and I've read all the books."" 

 ""Nerd.""
     
""Thanks. What do you want? I know you didn't come here just to insult me. You could do that in geography.""

""That biology test. I totally didn't study and daddy says he's going to take my phone away if I don't pass it.""

 ""And?"" 

  ""You have it next. I need you to write down the answers and give them to me.""

 ""You mean cheat? No thanks."" I got up to throw away my paper plate and napkin, but she shot her hand out and griped my wrist.

 ""What do you want?"" She pleaded

 ""Nothing you can give me."" I gathered my stuff and headed off to biology.


Chapter 2


I breezed through the test, first one done. While I was reading a weird book waiting for the class to finish, I heard something whizz by my head. I looked around wildly, thinking someone threw a paper airplane at me and discovered it was a blue jay. It looked at me with black eyes and cocked its head. It must have got in through the open window.

 ""Mr. Dex, I think you have a visitor,"" I said motioning at the creature, which was still stating intently at me. 

""You can handle it Natalie,"" he said not looking up from his papers. I gazed back at the bird and stood up slowly reaching to pet it's head. When I pet the top of its head it cooed and hopped on my arm. 

I was sure everyone was staring at me now. It's okay I thought at the bird as I started towards the open window. It chirped and turned its heat towards me, as if it had heard me. When I got to the window I perched him on the sill and tried to shoo him out. ""Come on, leave."" I gently pushed him out and he gazed at me, then flew away.

I turned back and sat down in my seat, just as the bell rang for next class. I grabbed my bag and headed to music class.

~~~~~~

 The rest of the day passed by normally, with Mindy bugging me in geography as usual. After my last class I headed down to the headmasters office the only person in there was a woman with a kind face, bright green eyes, and long straight brown hair, down to the middle of her back. She was a head shorter than me, but of course everyone was shorter than me. 

When I walked in she stood up and smiled at me. She looked genuinely happy to see me. ""Hi! I'm Samantha! Are you Natalie?"" She looked me up and down and smiled at me bigger. When I nodded she exclaimed ""great!"" And took my hand and led me out the door and up the stairs to the beds. 

 I dug my heels in the carpet out side the door. ""Woah, woah. Where are we going?"" 

""Don't you know? I'm taking you out of this school and to a new one! A better one! One meant for our kind."" She looked at me, expecting me to know what she was talking about. I gave her a quizzical look and shook my head.

 ""What do mean 'our kind'? Who are you?"" She stopped smiling and stared at a point behind me.

 ""Looks like we'll be staying for dinner. I have some explaining to do.""

I'm currently working on a large-scale saga but I've also devoted some time to a shorter story, more of a novella, taking place a century later.  I feel that the narrative is engaging in of itself and also serves to introduce some key points and references that are important to the larger work.

Here is a dust-jacket style blurb I wrote, in the hope that it might peak your interest:

""The Fortress of the Gungen Khil is the vanguard of the might of Deldar, the very first warning, and the very last outpost, against invasion by the demonic Sadurvag.  When new Second Commander Caalen Baren arrives, he is dismayed by the lack of discipline and the hostility in the other commanders.  However, his campaign against First Commander Odremed and his wily right-hand man Kiomad must be set aside when a disheveled and malevolent fugitive appears at their gates.  The man claims to be an escaped slave, straight from the mines of the Sadurvag, and he brings a warning.  The Tarmuri-Tir Gahgraa is active once more, and its army of demonic Kagling warriors, sixty thousand strong, is heading an invasion into the very heart of Deldar.  When all hope seems lost, the fate of their land shall be determined by the heroism of Caalen Baren—if, in the end, he can make the right choice.""

And here is a 2-page excerpt from Part One:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1svuHTRclMfwUaODuPsAm4tZOrar3vARXkl93q89aCj4/edit

I hope you enjoy it and would like to read more.  If you guys like it enough I will post a second excerpt soon.  Please leave feedback in the comments, I'd love to hear it.

Edit: I've had some complaints that there are too many unfamiliar names in the excerpt.  That's my fault, I forgot that I had so many.

If it helps, I decided to make a short glossary for the names, just to put some things in context.

Caalen - new Second Commander (high ranking military captain).

Deldar - the 'Gondor' country.

Gungen Khil - a badlands-style hill country north of Deldar.

Fortress of... - a border fortress that serves as a forewarning against a Sadurvag invasion.

Daemod - a fugitive who appears at their fort (called he-who-had-been-Daemod since he's so bedraggled).

Kiomad - another Second Commaner.

Sadurvag - several races of demonic creatures that frequently attack regions where humans live.

Kaglings - a breed of Sadurvag comparable to goblins or gnomes.

Lannacyndri - 'Cyndri' is the name of the world, like Middle-earth.  Lannacyndri is the largest region therein, in which Deldar is located and where most everything relevant to the larger story takes place.  'Lanna' means central, as in Central Cyndri.

Vannalinn - essentially a deity of light.

Vanndar Heliagir - a cultural hero like Achilles.

Anagond - a reference to a battle won against the Sadurvag.

Tarmuri-Tir Gahgraa - as far as the characters know, it's some word associated with the Sadurvag, like the name of their kingdom or realm.

Iunda - Caalen's horse.

I hope that helps a bit.  Sorry about all that, I didn't even notice how many of those names were in that passage.  Basically though, I wanted to know if the excerpt and blurb interested anyone enough that they might actually want to read more.

After years of putting her body on display for paying customers, all Rhea Scanti wanted was to make a life for her daughter in the same city that consumed her childhood.  Cejeroy Lester had no children of his own, just a family he had to protect and a wife he couldn’t keep happy if his life depended on it. Layle Ironhide would have given his soul for the woman he loved, but as fate would have it, the only woman he wanted was the one he could never have.  One worked the factory floor, one governed a nation, and one survived as best he could with the sword in his hand and the friends at his back.  The mother, the politician, and the soldier.  Theirs were three entirely separate destinies, bound only by the common rock beneath their feet and the blood all people share.

Krelstan was the one place that could bring them together.  A city on the river, shamed in the past and haunted in the present, with countless lures for the desperate.  Rhea, drawn by a fresh hope and trapped by an old despair.  Cejeroy, baited by the notion of the peace he wanted and cornered by the certainty of a war he couldn’t avoid.  Layle, never complaining, always following orders.  One by one, Krelstan would bring them.  Together, Krelstan would test them.

As for who would survive the encounter… only time and the tallied dead would tell.

If the mods see fit to remove this thread, I will not hold it against them.  

Now, that said: a challenge!  

It is my firm belief that characters are most strongly defined by other characters - that is, how the characters interact with each other. I would like to give you three characters, each with strong opinions of each other. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to establish and explore these opinions. The only rule is that you are not allowed to have a character simply state their opinion: you must *explore* it, with interactions and reactions.  

The setting is whatever you want, provided it is a closed circle - no one enters, no one leaves. The characters have access to whatever props you want.  

Character One is Rueford Bugle, a middle-aged businessman (or merchant, if you're inclined to fantasy). Bugle thinks of Beatrice as a barrier to future fortunes, but nonetheless still likes her on a personal level. Angler Hook is beneath his notice.  
Character Two is Beatrice Hammeril, an woman past the age of retirement who has just inherited her late husband's fortune. Beatrice thinks of Bugle as a money-grubbing opportunist, and is more than a little fond of her personal servant.  
Character Three is Angler Hook, Beatrice's personal servant. He has a great deal of respect for Bugle, but finds his employer to be nothing more than a demanding child.

My novel is about grim reapers. I randomly named my main character Jack (I usually go for short, simple names just to write the story out and change them later if needed). Only later did I realize that ""Jack the reaper"" sounds very much like ""Jack the ripper"". I thought it was funny, but I probably won't keep the name because of this connection. Too cheesy. 

So all my main characters are grim reapers/undead except for one living human, but that isn't revealed until late in the story. I randomly named this human Ani. Now as I research Latin words for name inspiration it turns out that ""Animax"" means ""alive"" or ""showing signs of life"" in Latin. This will fit perfectly into my story, as she can remain ""Ani"" in informal settings, and when her true nature and purpose is revealed they can learn that her full name is Animax.

The doors, massive frames gliding on their hinges as silent as black, swing away from me. I stride forward, and though I am apprehensive I am filled with absolute purpose. It is dark, but a solitary pathway, terminating in an observation deck, is illuminated now that the way is open.

I reach the end. The doors swing shut on their massive hinges. It is dark again.

**The Bitten**

The sun languishes slowly over the old farmhouse, the brilliant reds and oranges bouncing off the silo and hitting the great oak tree. In the distance the low hum of honeybees returning to their hive after a long day of work rumble. A warm breeze tickles the yellow daisies that line the stone walkway, carrying their sweet smells away with it. It is a beautiful summer evening by anyone’s standards, but the night ahead is foreboding.  

It wasn’t always this way. Before The Bites most people paid no attention to the cycles of the moon. Even in the beginning, the Deniers were adamant that the epidemic was not caused by our celestial friend. According to them, The Swarms were sent by an angry God who was punishing us for our various sins. But as time progressed and the epidemic spread, the link became clear. 

The Swarms always come during the New Moon. Hundreds of thousands of scorpions overrun towns, villages, large cities, devouring anyone in their path. The first Swarm caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. Some were fortunate enough to escape with only a few bites, but after a couple of days the fever took hold. The Bitten, as they came to be known, began showing signs of sickness 48 hours after being wounded by the insects. Their temperature rose to near-fatal highs and then the hallucinations started. Hospital wards were full of patients screaming at the top of their lungs, and though their words were unintelligible, were absolutely terrifying nonetheless. 


Then one night all was still. The fever was gone, the wailings stopped, and the patients were nowhere to be found. Hospital staff, family, friends, neighbours, anyone who knew someone who had been sick joined together in the search. Media outlets quickly picked up the story and the world spent the entire day in a panic. Where did these people go? Would they come back? Are they dangerous? Millions of questions without answers – at least for another few hours anyway. 


That night the Full Moon shone brightly in the sky.  Already on edge from the events of the past few weeks people locked their doors and windows, trying to ignore the uneasy feeling that everyone shared.  Some settled in for a restless sleep, others spent the evening glancing nervously around the house. But no matter where they were or what they were doing, everyone heard the wailing begin. It started as a low moaning and quickly worked it’s way up into an ear-piercing cry, one that made fingernails on a chalkboard sound like a lullaby. Just when you thought you couldn’t take it anymore, that the screaming would make your ears bleed, the wailing stopped.  And then they attacked. 


The scorpions were different this time. Most noticeably they were huge, much bigger than the average man. But that wasn’t the most frightening part.  These scorpions weren’t all insect – they were human too. Some had human arms or legs, some had the body of an insect but the head of a person, and some were still wearing their hospital gown. 


They came in droves, breaking down doors and windows, clawing their way down through the roof. The human-like insects were vicious in their attacks, devouring every living thing they came across. Once they got in there was no escape. People tried to fight them off with anything they could – few were successful. Those that were, found the only way to stop these monsters was with a couple of bullets to the brain. The Bitten would lie twitching on the floor, green sticky blood oozing from the holes in their head – and then they would vanish. 


The lucky people, the ones who survived the night without being eaten alive, began to stockpile the next day. The world was in chaos. Looters took everything of value from anywhere they could find. Neighbours turned on neighbours.  Families broke apart. Everywhere you went you could feel the weight of the panic, the way the air envelopes you on a hot and sticky day.  


Some of us worked together. We formed groups and societies with the common goal of staying alive. We were ready during the next New Moon. The scorpions swarmed but many less were Bitten – though we still lost far too many. And we were ready during the next Full Moon, but still people died. With every moon cycle we are more prepared, have better defences, more effective tactics. And with every cycle there is less and less of us. 


It has been 7 months since the first Swarm and humanity has not fared well. It is estimated that only one twentieth of the world’s population remains Unbitten. We spend our days looking for answers, searching for ways to prevent the next attack. So far nothing has worked. We have tried isolating the Bitten before they disappear, tying them down, putting them in cells, but they always vanish. And so we look to the sky. Wondering why the Moon sent the scorpions, nervously awaiting the next attack.


And now it is time to batten down the hatches, kiss your loved ones, and cock your gun. Because the full moon is clawing its’ way up, and the wailing is about to begin.

Colors swam over his vision, a liquid ball of pigments swirling over and around one another, but never mixing. His hands began to tingle and his legs were already numb. This was the cost of life, and payment was due.

Half his skull had been shattered by the red knight wielding his awful mace. He somehow retained consciousness as he had fallen from his own steed to land beneath stomping hoofs and fighting men. He had lain there, bodies piling up all around him, cloaking his still breathing corpse under a guise of death. The battle still raged on, but this piece of blood soaked ground had already been claimed. Its true victor waited for one more soul to pass into its grasp.

He closed his eyes, but the colors would not dissipate. He longed for oblivion’s sweet embrace to take away the pain, the nausea, the involuntary twitches that wracked his body. Death did not come though, and had it, it would not have been so merciful.

He had lived a hard life. A mercenary’s life. He had killed innocents and vented his rage and lusts on the victims of his warfare. The gods, whether he believed in them or not, would not grant him peace everlasting. Instead he had a visitor.

The crow looked down on him with an intelligence one only thinks capable of men. A new fear welled up inside him. He wished to flail his arms to shoo the little beast away, but they did not obey. He growled at it, but all that came out was a choked gurgle. The colors danced more brightly from the strain and his head throbbed in pain. The bird hopped forward and in one fast motion, plucked his left eye out with its beak. The man watched in stunned horror with his remaining eye as the thing tilted its thick black neck back. It opened its beak and scoffed down its morsel. A savage urge of delight welled up in the man, mixing with his already present anguish and horror as it choked on its prize. It only lasted a moment and a deep feeling of loss replaced delight as the creature managed to get its meal down. It cocked its head at him, stepped forward again and plucked out the other eye.

The man tried to scream, but met the same shortcomings as before. Colors still swam before the vision that had so permanently been robbed of him. A flutter of wings foretold of the beast’s friends arrivals, but the flutter soon became a chorus, and then a roar. The air about him stank of carrion and a rhythmic wind pattered his face, drying to his cheeks the blood that dripped from his empty sockets. The man now knew fear. This was his payment; to be eaten alive. How he wished he had been luckier.

Had he not blocked most of the red knight’s furious assault, he would already be dead. The jealousy he had of his fellow corpses flared with each moment as the murder descended on them. Tiny claws gripped onto exposed flesh as the clinks of feet on metal were all but drowned out by the ruckus. Then he noticed a voice in the commotion, as if the thousands of wings themselves spoke.

“Mortal man” the murder said. “You can hear us mortal man?” It asked of him.

The man gurgled, “yes”. He choked on his own words and coughed hard, relieving the phlegm in his lungs for a moment. He reiterate with a stronger voice, “yes.”

The murder responded, “Good. Mortal man, We have need of you. Will you obey us? We will return life to your dying body.”

The man cried, “My eyes. I can not see.” He whimpered, crying too difficult to achieve. “How can I help without eyes?”

The murder said, “We took your eyes. You will not need them. Had they remained, you would be dead.”

The man just sobbed in self pity.

The murder said, “Will you obey us? Or will you die? We are not patient and grow ever hungry.”

Fear jolted the man again. The thought of a god consuming him was a horrible one. “I will obey”, He squeaked as another coughing fit racked him.

The murder said, “Then sleep.” He obeyed.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_1f74st,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1f74st/the_murder_a_very_short_story_750_words_to_be/,

I'm not going to write the story, so I thought it might be a fun thing to develop as a group.

Here's what I posted:

&gt; * **Conflict/Problem:** Medical Issue

&gt; * **Setting to Include:** A government office

&gt; * **Character:** A deadly former lab assistant.

&gt; * **Character:** A solitary recently-retired graphic designer.

&gt; Let's set this in a fantasy setting, so we'll make the government office the tax collector's little fiefdom. Big fat man sitting in the middle of a large room, collecting money.

&gt; Our former lab assistant is deadly - okay, so somewhere she picked up some skills, abilities, or traits that makes her unpleasant to be around. Maybe an alchemical experiment went wrong, and now she's a mutant, with poisonous fingernails. But she still owes taxes, because it's a head tax. But she can't find a lab job, because she's dangerous to be around.

&gt; Our graphic designer obviously wasn't using InDesign in the pseudo-middle-ages, so we'll make her a designer of heraldry - a rebel, since women aren't generally doing such things.

&gt; The conflict is a medical issue, so... hrm. Okay. Someone's sick, and can't get treatment? Someone's received a death wound? Someone has an embarrassing medical issue?

&gt; Ah, that's it.

&gt; Okay. The tax collector will let the lab assistant slide on her taxes, but only if she takes on a job for him. The heraldry designer, he tells her, is an affront against Gods and man, and she has to be taken out, and taken out in a stealthy fashion. (But really, and the Deadly Assistant doesn't know this, the collector had tried to force himself on the heraldry designer, but then she saw that the tax collector had a mutant twin growing out of his side, and when she gasped and ran he made it his mission to force her out of business... now she's learned that he was behind that, and is threatening to expose his demon familiar to all and sundry.)

&gt; But the heraldry designer is a good friend of the Deadly Assistant's--a former lover, pushed away by the transformation but still longed-after. DA doesn't want to kill her. If she doesn't, though, the tax bill will send her to debtor's prison... and the Assessor's no fool; he's left documents that will damn her and make sure her entire family is put into debtor's prison if she just kills him...

&gt; So we have:

&gt; * Character: Deadly Lab Assistant.

&gt; * Situation: Faced with debtor's prison if she doesn't comply, the Deadly Lab Assistant must either kill the woman she loves or figure out a way to turn the tables on the tax assessor who threatens her and her family.

&gt; * Goal: Get out of this situation and back to normal life.

&gt; * Opposition: The tax assessor opposes her resuming her normal life. The lover opposes dying.


So here's what I think would be fun. Given this starting point, I'd love to group-develop this into a 3-5k word short story in a completely serious manner, first in a scant outline and then in a more detailed outline here. When the outline is done, I'll create a Google Doc and send the participants the link. And when we all agree it's done then we can submit it to some market as ""by /r/fantasywriters"" and when we get our tiny little check we buy the mods some reddit gold. And if we get a good check we buy the mods some reddit gold and split the rest. And if we sell the movie rights for a million billion dollars we buy the mods some reddit gold, the rest of /r/fantasywriters some (root)beer, and THEN we split the rest. :)

But it all starts with the outline. And maybe a few character names. Wanna play? ",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,title,True,t3_1eskc9,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1eskc9/shall_we_play_a_game/,

Aban’s considerable bulk was masked by the narrow alley’s shadows. He lowered his head to the ground to study the ruined metal grate. Its thick iron bars looked as though they had been cut by something very hot. Their melted tips protruded about an inch creating a large hole through which almost anyone could pass. Aban rubbed a tentacle over a severed prong and held up a glass vial with a tiny jellyfish bobbing within. He gave the flask two quick shakes. In response the creature lit up with a bright blue glow. Under the expelled light Aban looked at his tentacle inspecting for rust. He found none, the cut was fresh. He squeezed his massive frame through the grate into the sewers below.

He landed in a crouch, his hands and feet splashing in a shallow runnel of waste from the city above. The water barely crested his naked toes and although it wasn’t drinkable, the smell could have been much worse. Aban breathed in surprised relief when he realized the upper crust of Krasnyi must have their filth carted and dumped in the slums’ sewers.

There was only one way to go. He clutched the jelly lamp high with one of his tentacles. Its light extended far illuminating a long tubular corridor. Aban waddled forward, his feet and hands quietly slipping forward as he crawled. He held his other four tentacles free of the filth not wanting to get unnecessarily fouled. After half a league the first man-sized connection joined with his tunnel.

Before approaching the intersection, Aban slipped the jelly lamp inside his tunic extinguishing its light. He approached silently, probing with his tentacles for any clue of Sindar’s passing or a trap he may have set. It wouldn’t be the first trap Aban discovered that could have proved fatal. As he approached the corner of the adjacent tunnel, he heard a clatter of metal on stone followed by two cries of surprise. He withdrew his kukris holding one in each hand and turned the corner to confront the commotion.

Two human men, Aban figured most likely Wealdish by their size, struggled with a monstrous snake. It coiled about the farther man’s waist. The free man, seeing struggle was pointless, nearly slammed into Aban’s form as he turned to abandon his friend. His metal oil lantern clanged on the floor and almost went out after being dropped in shock. Another lantern lay snuffed next to the serpent’s body. Two blurs of Aban’s kukris were nearly invisible as they separated chunks of the snake from the trapped man’s torso.

“Another t-t-toad.” The reeling man stuttered as he looked up in horror at Aban.

“I, am not, a toad,” Aban wheezed from the sudden exertion. After a few more breaths, his breathing steadied. He said, “I am a negroil. I am here looking. Looking for another. Another like me. You said *another*. You have seen another? Tell me. How long ago? Where?” Aban’s stare held the man fixed in place. The coward seemed to lose all senses, able to reply only in stammers. Aban snapped his mouth open and shut and croaked, “Listen! Answer me. Time is short.”

The man, startled by Aban’s flashing teeth, sobered up. He replied, “Yes, this, this morning. I, we saw it, him, she.” The man seemed to falter, not wanting to offend this creature that could so quickly end his life. When no provocative action was taken, the man continued, “Apologies if I offend…” The man paused, unsure of how to address the toad-beast in front of him. “Sir?” He added.

“My name… Aban. Continue please. *Where* was he?” Aban asked in a grating croak.

The other man, now clearly recovered from having his life nearly squeezed from him, answered for his terrified friend. “Sir, we see’d him. Yes, we did. We see’d him this morning, yes we did. Aaron and I see’d him near the slum pits we did sir. We can take you there sir. Take you there sir, we go. Come sir, follow Jarek, we take you,” The simple man stooped down, grabbed and re-lit his lantern with the twist of a switch, and ran down the hall with Aaron in tow who was too fearful to be left alone.

Aban followed the pair along winding corridors and down steep stairways until Jarek grabbed Aaron by the shoulder and hissed, “Jarek, you bear-brained fool. I don’t think our master here wishes us to alert his friend. We should let him go alone from here.”

Only a stairway back, Aban had noticed a faint wind pulling him forward. Here, the wind was stronger and an audible roar could be heard ahead in the distance. Aban knew he was close.

Jarek said, “Right, right. You so smart Aaron. That’s why you is the leader, it is.” Then Jarek screamed as Aaron’s head toppled forward.

Aban croaked, “I am sorry.” Mercifully, he did not give the child-like man time to truly understand what was happening. He quickly decapitated him in the same manner as Aaron, sighed sadly and hopped onward.

Aban turned a corner. An intense heat washed over him from the mouth of a cavern less than a stone’s throw away while the howling wind he’d been following sucked him onward. An ancient stone bridge crossed a dark lake connecting the tunnel to an island. At its center a great column of fire was devouring a huge pile of refuse. The flame’s light reflected off still waters illuminating giant stalactites poised overhead as if aiming to bring down the whole cave’s weight on those within. The city’s trash was collected and incinerated here, though never were the flames so greedy in their voracity. Most of the smoke poured up and out through pits in Krasnyi’s slums. Still, a choking haze hung low and thick enough to burn Aban’s windpipe even as he remained in the hallway. Standing in front of the great pyre and commanding it was Sindar. There was no mistaking the other negroil even from this distance.

All five of Sindar’s tentacles were raised in the air tracing patterns of command as he stared upwards, a look of determination etched in the squint of his eyes. His left hand held straight forward the silvery rod those of his order require to focus their energy in the casting of flame and metal. His right moved like a child feverishly digging in the sand, seemingly directing the base of the fiery tornado as the monstrosity danced in similar fashion.

Aban drew shadows about himself, making his form impervious to the light flooding the entry into the chamber. Wary of his quarry siting him, Aban crept forward onto the old bridge probing with both his tentacles and shadows for the inklings of the trap he knew Sindar would have placed to warn him of any intruders. The stones beneath him burned with absorbed heat. Aban knew he’d need to reconsider his slow approach across the expanse. He hopped forward, but as he landed the stones beneath his bulk screamed in protest. Together, they fell away into the waters below.

Surfacing, Aban heard Sindar bellow, “Aban, old friend! There is no sense denying. I know it is you who joined me here. Only one so fat as you could have smashed through those stones I weakened so cleanly.” He chuckled and added, “You took down half the bridge, Aban! And besides, I’ve known you’ve been following me for quite some time, old friend.”

Old friend. Indeed the two were old friends, but only in the sense they were friends a long while ago. Different choices on life’s journeys brought the two to very different destinations. Those decisions shaped who they had now become. Sindar’s path was often found delving into the darkest regions of the world. Aban now pitied his childhood playmate for the task he was set on more than three years earlier. Aban had been sent to kill Sindar.

His high pitched croak sounded almost sickly. With sucking shallow breaths Aban responded as the illusory magic he commanded threw his voice in all directions. “Oh Sindar. You have fallen so far. Yes. My body is fat. My movements slow. My voice winded. But don’t underestimate. My spirit. Or my body. They are powerful. I regret. Regret I could not spare. Spare you the knowledge. The knowledge of your impending death. I wished you that last mercy.” He eyed Sindar from the concealing depths.

A chortling croak erupted from Sindar’s thick lips. “Aban, old friend. Must we war? We were spawn brothers. I would have you an ally, not another victim of our masters’ wills. Throw aside your delusions. Join me. I will show…”

Aban cut him off. “Show me Sindar? Tell me lies? Feed me poison? Throw my flesh to Yrdel? Like you did to Khalil? No. Old friend. You know why. Why I have tracked you. Tracked across nations.” Aban dove beneath the surface. An enraged Sindar bent the column of fire over on itself to churn and burn the waters where he had been hiding only moments earlier.

Aban’s massive legs kicked as his powerful arms pulled. The giant webs on both thrust him far from the hellish cauldron that section of the lake had become. Sindar’s fury was relentless. He cast the flame across the waters all around the island. The bowed jet carved furrows into the surface leaving a boiling wake as it passed. If Sindar were allowed to keep torching the water, Aban would be cooked alive.

Aban swam deep below the passing flame. He came up silently and quickly swam to the island’s shore. The ripples would give away his location, but Sindar’s back was turned. Aban’s magic muffled his noise as he remained shrouded in shadow, all light passing right through him. He crouched on the trash strewn soil a mere three hops from Sindar. He unsheathed the khanjar his masters entrusted to him for this purpose only and leaped.

Something warned Sindar of his presence. He whipped around, just as Aban had closed in for the kill. The tower of flame lashed Aban’s leg, burning skin and muscle, charring bone. Aban spasmed. The artifact fell free of his hand to fall useless at Sindar’s feet as agony racked his body.

Sindar shuffled back in shock. He looked down at the blade. Crafted of violentium, sheer ribbons of purple danced just below the dull-silvery surface. Realization dawned. Sindar grinned savagely at the sight of his old friend twisting in agony at his feet. Two flicks of the flame and Aban lay motionless. “Old friend.” Sindar said with only a hint of remorse. He crouched down, gathered up the blade and its sheath off of Aban’s corpse. Sindar turned back to his task, searching through the pile of refuse, for something.

* * *

Aban awoke. He was shackled in chains. His leg throbbed, his back burned, his left eye was blinded. He looked about with his good eye, but saw nothing more than shadowy outlines. A small square room, a shallow puddle of water pooled in the low corner. No, not water. Ordure and urine by the rank smell of it. The pain was too much. He blacked out.

“Wake friend. We have some questions for you.” The velvety voice lulled him from his fevered dreams. A torch now sputtered in the far corner by the room’s only entry, a heavy wooden door with a small barred window. A man stood near in crimson robes, head cast in the shadows of his cowl. “Yes. That’s right. Wake up now. We would like to know who you are and how you came to inhabit our sewers.” The man asked Aban as he slowly came awake.

Aban’s body agonized, his leg most of all. He tried to make out his injuries, but the shackles held him tightly. Straining against his bonds only resulted in increased pain that was just too much to bear. Aban looked at his captor, finally understanding his situation. He had failed. Sindar was gone and now he lay in some rank dungeon beneath the Rhokian capital city of Krasnyi. Worse, the labyrinthine tattoos snaking over the hooded man’s exposed hands marked him as a seer – the bane of his own order, the illusionists.

The seer said, “I can ease your suffering, but you need to first tell me who you are.” The man’s voice seemed to pull at Aban’s very nature. He wanted to tell this man the truth, and all of it. From when he and Sindar were children to the day his masters tasked him to track and slay the renegade negroil. Aban knew this was sorcery tugging at him, imploring the truth free itself from his mouth, but there was nothing he could do. Resistance was hopeless. He was trapped, bound, and unable to control his umbra. He had no defense save his own willpower and that was so weak. The honeyed words worked their magic.

He said, “My name is Aban.” With those words, the truth flew from his mouth in a torrent.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,1369110815.0,,,True,t3_1eqtw3,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1eqtw3/old_friends_short_chapter_2182_words_critiques/,

1) Is it funny? Why/why not?

THE MILDLY INTERESTING ADVENTURES OF BOB'N'BETS.

Six feet meandered along a winding dirt path. The feet had no exact destination, but they certainly had an objective: to find a friend that had been long since lost. The wanderers knew that their friend was in no immediate danger, but they also knew that the quicker they found him, the better it would be for all of them. But until then, they had to survive the hardships, the trials and the heartbreak of being away from their friend...
...and alone together.

“You stinky bitch... you just farted perfectly upwind from me on purpose, didn’t you!” accused Robert. Betsy just looked back and gave a cheeky grin before she scampered further along the dirt path. “I swear I’m going to have to stop getting those biscuits you like so much, it has to be them.”
Robert saw a small pebble and kicked it towards Betsy, hoping it would collide with the back of her legs, or with some luck her ever flatulent arse. Instead however it just ran out of momentum and stopped around halfway between them.
He sighed and continued on after Betsy. This was always the way. Although neither party had the slightest notion where they were headed, Betsy always chose the directions when they ran out of clues. Now was one of those times, and Betsy had chosen to move in a north-west direction.
Time passed as Robert and Betsy ambled along the dirt path until it rose to the crest of a hill. In the distance, they could both see a tiny village poking out from some trees. As they approached it they came across a sign that told them the settlement was named - 
“Lengthy Timber?!” exclaimed Robert, looking at the puce coloured sign that welcomed the wanderers to the small hamlet. Betsy cocked her head to one side, and then barked at the sign in protest of the horrible font.  (She couldn’t comment on it being puce coloured, what with being colour blind and all.)The two looked at each other and then again at the sign. It really was shabby. Age had caused the paint to curl from the wood, which was white with age. Two empty hooks underneath the sign seemed lonely with no extra signage to hold.  Despite a totally ridiculous name, it seemed that the spot would be ideal to rest their weary feet and paws.



Upon entering the village, Robert shuddered with a strange sense of familiarity. The townsfolk eyed him and the bitch up as they walked past a small shop. Two short and stubby women, who looked as if their gossip was their life’s calling, followed the wanderers with their almost fearful eyes.
“Take a picture it lasts longer” snapped Robert.
One of the women reached into her grocery bag without breaking eye contact and obliged, taking a picture with her small camera. Betsy yipped in approval of the woman’s sheer cheek. (Her yip was more of approval someone doing something that annoyed or irritated Robert than the actual cheekiness of her actions. But you get the idea.)  
“Come on” grumbled the bested Robert as he walked further through the town. He soaked in his surroundings noticing an antiques shop, another shop, a few taverns and a small park. The village’s only street was bookended with something resembling a town hall on one end, and a very creepy religious statue on the other. He stopped walking and looked around, trying to decide if the man he was trying to find might have stopped here, or if he, like Robert himself was thinking, got the heck out of dodge. 
Before Robert could make any decision at all, he heard a low threatening growl come from beside his left leg. Robert recognised the growl as Betsy’s “there-is-a-seriously-massive-dickhead-approaching-let’s-get-out-of-here-before-he-talks-to-us” growl. But before Robert make a move he felt his hand lifted into a never-ending handshake.
“Jeff Johnson Head! I am so please you came to visit our wonderful little town! Would you like a tour?! It is such a great place I think you should come on the tour! Come on right this way!” 
The man had a smile taking up the entire bottom half of his head, with a pointed nose. His beady, greedy looking eyes were scanning Robert and trying to figure out how he could make some cash out of him. This look in his eye, coupled with the fact that he was still shaking his hand, unnerved Robert.
“We’re fine. We both would much rather... um... explore this village on our own terms,” replied Robert, being careful not to offend the man in case he had some power in the town. Jeff’s smile didn’t falter and instead seemed to grow bigger.
“We?! Are you here with a friend!?”
“Not really. She’s more of a pest.”
“Oooohhh! The wife is in the shops eh?!” assumed Jeff.
“Nope. Not married. Betsy is –“
“Say no more! Girlfriend! Almost worse than a wife, but at least you still get to have fun!”
Jeff doubled over with laughter, finding his own joke hilarious.  (Whereas in actual fact, it was just chauvinistic, sexist, and just unfunny.)Robert was getting annoyed. 
	“I don’t have a girlfriend. I’m spoken for. Betsy, as I was saying, is a dog.”
This seemed to grab Jeff’s attention. He stood bolt upright, his smile still forced, just in a completely different way. His eyes shifted from Robert’s face, to the space beside his feet where a dog normally would be. There she was. She was panting, her long pink tongue barely concealing razor sharp teeth, dripping with venom. Although he couldn’t see them, Jeff was petrified of annoying the dog enough for her to unleash her stingers, hidden in her ears and tail.  (Jeff’s knowledge of dog, or even mammal biology, was quite inaccurate.)
“Well um... haha! That’s ah... ha! Unusual! Well, town law states I have to give... um... ALL visitors to the town a tour! So er.... whadiya say?!” 
Betsy scratched at Robert’s leg. She wanted to get out of the village, and so did Robert.
“I think we’ll give it a miss... Sorry erm... Jeff Dick Hea-“
“Johnson! Jeff Johnson Head! I’m afraid I’ll have to insist chum! I really feel that it is my duty to introduce all visitors to the town! It’s the least I can do!” he countered, all while smiling. There was something slightly off about the way he spoke. It was almost as if every sentence he spoke ended with an exclamation mark. The handshake had finally stopped and Jeff had instead snaked his arm around Robert’s shoulder. Robert felt trapped, but couldn’t decide if that was because of how creepy Jeff was, or because he had just noticed that the whole village was watching them from their windows.
“Okay then... let’s go I suppose” 

Jeff had started the tour by crossing the street to a small pub.
“The pub we are approaching is known locally as ‘Stoney’s’! It has been passed from father to son for decades, From Boulder Burke, to Stoney, to Pebbles! Pebbles doesn’t have a son but we all hope that his daughter Sandy will take over and...Erm... sorry my friend but all buildings in this town have a strict ‘No Canine’ rule!” They had reached Stoney’s door, and Jeff was holding it ajar. Jeff turned his gaze to Betsy with a look of disgust and a slight hint of fear. Betsy cocked an ear and eyebrow and glanced at Robert as if to say “If you leave me outside I will make you regret it.” Robert, still regretting the last time he left her outside , (He left her outside while he ran into a hospital to use the bathroom. Having been gone all of 15 seconds, the revenge had been going on for the last 15 years.) pleaded Betsy’s case on her behalf.
	“She’ll be grand! There’s no harm in her at all, honestly. ”
“I don’t think so; we have a very very strict ‘No Canines’ rule as I’ve already said!”
“But I can assure you that anything you worry about her doing will not happen.”
	The two men continued this back and forth, Robert pleading Betsy’s case, Jeff explaining that it wasn’t going to happen. Neither realised that Bets simply ignored them and trotted inside. He tiny claws  clicked and clacked on the flagstone floor of the tavern. 
It was dark, but her nocturnal eyes enabled her to see the patrons of the pub before they saw her. There were few people around, but those that were around were seated in small clusters, discussing the weather of the day. A large moustache with a man hiding behind it was working at the bar. He was a rock of a man, rubbing a dirty glass with an even dirtier rag. Betsy trotted to a small stool, hopped onto it, from there a table, a higher stool and finally the bar itself. Knowing that the barman didn’t speak Dog, she panted heavily and gave a huge grin, hoping that’d be enough of a hint to be provided with some water. 
	The barman’s dirty rag stopped cleaning the glass  with surprise. His eyes opened slowly to see a clawed, razor toothed beast with six nipples seated on his bar. A hush fell over the pub as all eyes turned to the barman and the thing in front of him. 
	Totally misreading the situation, Betsy gave an adorable little yip, and rolled onto her back to show her belly. That usually got her what she wanted.

	Outside, Robert and Jeff were still locked in their battle of the wits. Their arguments however had devolved into
	“She won’t.”
	“She will!”
“She won’t.”
	“She will!”
“She won’t.”
	“She will!”
“She won’t.”
	“She will!”
“She never has, and never will take a shit on the floor. She hates the indoors.”
“Do you have documentation to prove such a statement?!”
Robert wasn’t a violent man. He didn’t have a temper, and he was very capable of diffusing situations before fists got involved. Never once, in all of his years, had he hit a person for any reason .( Before his travels, Ger, Robert’s brother, was trying to learn the drums. Robert snapped, ran upstairs, and created “Cullentra Drumming”, where one uses a siblings head in place of drumsticks. So technically he never hit a person, he just used a person to hit something. ) He was, however, just about to punch Jeff Johnson Head right in the mouth if it wasn’t for the womanly scream of terror coming from the pub.
	Jeff and Robert ran inside to find the proprietor of the bar standing on a high stool, screaming and pointing towards the floor. 
	“Get it away! GET IT AWAY!”
The pair looked at where Stoney was pointing and saw Betsy rolling around being as cute as she could be, without being degrading. Robert laughed involuntarily, while Jeff slowly backed out of the door to run to the town hall. Robert walked towards the dog and scratched her belly before picking her up. He looked around the pub and was very confused by the quivering staff and customers, who were all standing on stools and tables. Robert was both confused and amused.
“What’s wrong? She only wanted some water...”
“Th-th-that... THING came in here and... and..” began Stoney.
“Tried to steal our SOULS!” finished a customer.
“Won’t someone PLEASE think of the CHILDREN!” demanded a woman down the back.
“Hang on now there fairly lively!” exclaimed Robert. He could sense that the crowd had a major problem with Betsy being in the room, “There’s nothing wrong with this dog at all, so what’s with the over-reaction?”
	“Gruff...” muttered Betsy.
	“Exactly!” agreed Robert.
The fearful occupants of Stoney’s Pub didn’t seem all that convinced. Most of them stood still, bar their trembling knees, but Stoney himself spoke up. 
	“You better get th-that godforsaken thing out of here, and by here I don’t just mean this pub, I mean the village!”
A grumble of agreement emerged from everyone else in the room. Although there most certainly was a very noticeable stench of fear, Betsy could get a small whiff of anger, which was getting stronger. She growled so quietly that Robert didn’t hear it, but felt it. He knew then that Betsy was telling him to be careful.
Nodding to show his compliance, Robert slowly started to back out of the pub, Betsy firmly in his grasp. He pushed against the door and left the pub arse first. This village clearly had a problem with his dog, and possibly all dogs. They needed to leave as soon as they could. 



Approximately two miles outside of the town, the sign that Robert and Betsy came across stood tall, shabby as it was. It seemed to be proud of its status and position, towering above the rushes and grass that was growing at its feet. Underneath that grass, with a small amount of fine moss growing on it, lay a secondary sign that once hung underneath. Its message was plain and simple. “Canines and their owners are not welcome. Owning or being a dog is punishable by death.”



“I’m not a happy camper,” stated Robert. 
“Mmmphf... rrrrmph,” came the muzzled reply. 
The sticky summer air rolled into the small cell the wanderers had been shoved into. That Jeff character had snuck off to get a net and some handcuffs during the mishap in Stoney’s, and the pair were captured the second Robert stepped outside.

I want to include small vignettes throughout. I'd love a critique of my style and if reading this makes the world as interesting to the reader as it is to me. 

This vignette would be given more context by its placement in the sourcebook, specifically about the Church of Luminarus, the floating, holy city of Sanctum, and the country Jaak'Xol below... Enjoy! :)

IN THE FLOATING CITY OF SANTUM

""Brother Darvis! Brother Darvis!"" a young boy's voice called into the courtyard, echoing through the white stone walls and into the lush atrium where he was told he would find the priest. Past clergy and laymen the boy flew, carrying with him an urgent summons. His dark hair wet with sweat and his robes whipping behind him, he rushed past the vibrant flowers and thick greenery to a small, open air stadium where the strongest and most fearless of the priests honed themselves for battle. Often the boy had spent hours in the simple stone stands, watching the clergymen engage each other. Dark, strong men from Jaak'xol stood watching, their chests, arms and faces ritually tattooed, as one of their number pitted himself against the fair-skinned, blonde-haired Brother Darvis McDade, a giant of a man in his own right, yet even he seemed small and delicate compared to his opponent.

The messenger boy rushed down the stairs two at a time and skidded to a halt at the edge of the stadium floor, just as the Jaak'xolian in the arena was deftly pinned. Brother Darvis stood and offered his hand to his fellow clergyman, both men smiling at the pleasure of hard-fought match, as the others laughed and cheered, making friendly jests at their kin.  ""Jus' keep practicin', Tal'ock. You'll get me one day,"" Brother Darvis said, his Malineeran accent thick.  

""Brother Darvis!"" the boy cried out. ""I have a summons for you from Cardinal Gailynd! He says it's really important! You have to hurry.""
""A'right, Jacob, a'right. I'm comin',"" he said as he quickly splashed his sweaty face and hair with cool water and snatched up his robes from the stands. Jacob could plainly see the expansive, stylized sun tattoo that covered Brother Darvis' back, as well as the terrible scar that ran across his ribs and to his stomach. It was that jagged, black scar that gave the priest what notoriety he had, for few men have ever survived an attack from one of the Tainted, the ravenous walking dead. Jacob was so curious to hear the story, as were all the other acolytes, but he dared not ask the priest. He knew it was a tale Brother Darvis rarely told. Most felt certain it was simply not the kind of day any person would ever want to relive. Jacob watched as Brother Darvis jogged out of the stadium and out into the bustling streets of the Holy City of Sanctum.  



Cardinal Gailynd paced back and forth by the tall windows that lined his study. Their stained glass told the story of the terrible war that once threatened humanity and how Luminarus' love for his children pulled the city of Sanctum from the earth and set it to move through the heavens. That was thousands of years ago, but to this day the city chased the sun, constantly basking in the light of their god. The poor, the downtrodden, the injured and oppressed still came to its streets, but Cardinal Gailynd knew that his lifetime had been one of peace compared to the dark times the world had seen in the past. The Great Temple was more likely to bring to the city the impoverished, the hungry. This was bittersweet to the Cardinal - though humanity did not have to face the terrible ravages of war, they had been beset upon by another enemy: each other. Cruel despots and tyrants, the greed of petty lords, these were the things that plagued mankind.  

""Without a common enemy, a common suffering, how we turn on each other like hungry wolves,"" he whispered to himself as he looked to the young, fresh-faced priest who knelt in fervent prayer beside the Cardinal's small shrine to their god. The young man's dark hair was beaded with sweat, his face pale and sallow, not with hunger or disease, but with shock and a creeping madness.  

The door to his chamber opened and Brother Darvis, slightly out of breath, entered the room.  

""You summon'd me, Cardina... Brother Eli?"" Darvis hurried to the young priest's side. ""Cardinal Gailynd, is he a'right? What happened?"" Darvis tried to move Eli so he could get a look at him, but he would not be pulled from his prayers, would not even open his eyes.  

""There is nothing wrong with his health, Brother Darvis. It is what has befallen his mind."" He took a deep breath and ran his hands over his face and his snowy white hair. With a sigh, Cardinal Gailynd simply stated, ""It was a priest of Remelphon. Eli believes that he is divinely cursed.""

Darvis' eyes burned for a moment. But he stood and said calmly, ""Where?""

""A Baghian wedding boat in Salinas. Brother Eli was to preside,"" the cardinal said as he gave Darvis a scroll from his desk, sealed with the symbol of the church. Darvis took the scroll and went to leave the room, but stopped.  

""Cardinal Gailynd, will Brother Eli be well again?"" he asked, his voice small and concerned.  

""We don't know. Even as we speak they are preparing the temple and calling some of the other cardinals. We will do all we can, but it is impossible to tell how deeply the lie has taken root in his mind, or how powerful the Remelphonian priest was. We just don't know yet,"" the cardinal said as he laid his hand on Eli's shaking, bowed head. ""We will do all we can, Brother Darvis. But go now. His acolyte, Liam, is still in Salinas.""

Darvis ran as fast as he could to collect what he needed and make his way to the Great Temple. Damned priests of Remelphon! he thought. What person can take such pleasure in making another's life worse? Not even the mercy of a quick death, but the creeping terror of insanity?  Up the tall stairs he flew, into the Great Temple, and sparing not even a moment to glimpse the splendor of this place, he knelt before the altar and prayed softly in his native tongue.  

""Justicar of the First Torch, Father of Life and Light, hear your son. Grant me passage to your children in Salinas, so that I may keep them safe from the lies and trickery of your nephew, Remelphon, and his servants, and preside over the blessed union of marriage. Let me be a light unto the world, through your grace and through your mercy...""
A flare of brilliant light consumed the priest in Sanctum and filled, at the same time, the small temple in Salinas which was shrouded in night.  

""... until the day no darkness is left."" Brother Darvis opened his eyes and found around him the simple temple, empty this late at night. He slung his pack over his broad shoulder and set out to hunt a snake in the grass.

I have had this bug to write for a long time. I started developing my world of Estorad about two years ago, and in my free time wrote out a long document containing the histories of the world.


I then began to write short little blurb like stories that went no where, then I chose a time period in the history and chose to start writing. I know it can be ambitious to set out and do this task but I really want to do this. I feel like I have a good concept and hope my writing can match what is in my head.


This is my prologue. It takes place about 5782 standard years before the events of the main story, but give you a glimpse of the main Villain, Virithimis the demonic henchman of the dark God: Emeron. He is defeated but comes back to posses the brother of the protagonist and becomes the one of the antagonists in the story.

The story is about a young woman who discovers that she is a witch, something that is illegal in her society [As the first chapter shows].   

I

The accusation whispered through the narrow streets of the town.  It fluttered through open windows and slipped between the cracks in closed doors, never staying in the same place long enough to be pinned down or its source identified.  None of those who spoke it would admit afterwards that theirs was one of the raising chorus of voices that gave it its strength.  All who heard it looked the other way, closed their doors or made signs of protection over themselves.
Yet even though no wind carried it and all rain washed it away, the accusation spread.  First through the windy streets and then out the massive gates into the villages that clustered around its imposing walls and then into the countryside beyond.  The peasants who heard it bolted their doors at night and kept their fires blazing through the hours of darkness.  They huddled around them, symbols of protection carved into rude wooden amulets grasped in their calloused hands.  It was an accusation which caused instant and real fear.  It was the accusation of being a witch.  A witch had been discovered by the vigilance of the brave templars and was being transported back to the town for trial.

The procession carrying the accused witch announced itself well in advance of appearing.  The huge timber wheels of the massive caged prison wagon threw up great clouds of dust as they rumbled along the dry dirt roads.  Four templars, all dressed in travel stained white tunics with the crest of the Order of the Righteous sewn high to the right of their breast and mounted on white chargers proceeded the prison wagon.  One of them carried aloft the fluttering banner of the Order of the Righteous.  The other three were armed with long steel pointed spears.  Heavy steel helmets and circular shields were hanging from their saddles.  Two more templars, armed with heavy crossbows, sat beside the driver of the prison wagon.  Another four, also armed with spears, rode behind the prison wagon.  A single man, dressed in a black cloak and a wide brimmed hat shadowing his face, rode alone beside the procession.  He rode alone on a grey horse, cantering from the group of templars in front to those behind and then sometime riding alone.  He never stayed long with any of the groups of templars and he did not speak to them.  They did not take any notice of him, none of them turned their heads from looking directly ahead.  His head never stayed still, but turned as his eyes flickered from side to side, taking in everything in the rolling landscape they were travelling through.  Searching for dangers and scanning for problems.  He was not armed with any obvious weapons and he sat much better in his horse than the templars.

The cage of the prison wagon had been covered with thin white cloth.  The symbols of the Order had been sewn onto the cloth, symbols of containment and symbols of protection.  A figure, or the shadow of a figure, could be seen within the cage lurching and snarling its way around like an animal, rushing at the bars before cowering away towards the centre of the cage.  The cloaked man rode beside the wagon from time to time, his eyes focused on the figure.

In each village, that the procession passed through, the people crowded together by the side of the road in order to watch it.  They stood in fearful silence, each forming the sign of protection with their fingers over themselves or their family.  Their eyes were fixed on the cage, almost as if they were not able to shift them, even had they wanted to.  Once the procession had pressed on, the silence was destroyed, like a balloon that had been popped and the small crowds expressed loudly to each other those theories that they had kept to themselves while the procession was in sight.

It would be generous in the extreme to describe the cluster of ramshackle dwellings that the procession stopped at for the night as a village.  They were gathered haphazardly around a tiny shrine to Tine and beside an old wooden bridge which spanned a wide rushing river.  The dry timbers of the bridge groaned worryingly as the prison wagon lumbered over it.  Its entire population was gathered around the then shrine.  In front of them an old stooped priest in red robes protected the people with his shadow.  There was a large common area between the houses and the river.

The group of templars in front stopped and looked back to the cloaked man for confirmation.  He nodded and then spurred his horse so that he was standing in front of the priest.  

“We are proud to welcome the Order of the Righteous to our village,” the priest wheezed in a loud voice.  The cloaked man nodded, accepting the welcome.  His eyes scanned over the crowd from behind a silk face mask.  

“The young woman that we escort stands accused of the most vile and evil of all witchcraft,” he said, his voice cold and chipped.  “She is confirming her guilt by refusing to cooperate with the Blessed Order of the Righteous.  She may try to speak with you, to plead with you, to corrupt you into helping her escape.  Her words will be like honey, sweet but sticky.  If you aid her then you are as guilty as she is and will be hunted down and brought to justice by the Templars of the Order of the Righteous.  May Tine protect us all.”  He did not wait for a reply but turned back to the templars.

They had ignored the villagers completely and were making camp in the open ground.  The horses were stripped of their saddles and led to the water to drink before being hobbled close to the prison wagon.  The driver took the wagon horse to the water himself, glaring at the templars as if he felt aggrieved.

Once the horses had been cared for, the templars lit a fire close to the wagon.  A large post was produced from under it and driven into the ground.  There was a heavy chain attached to the pole and a pulsing symbol had been carved into the wood at the top.  The entire village stepped forward to see if they could catch a glimpse of the witch while she was being led from the cage to the post but the templars shielded her well with white cloth.  Once they had secured her, they constructed walls of white symbol covered cloth around her.  She did not resist them but walked slowly and sat beside the post, statue-like.  One of the templars filled a bucket with water and brought it into her prison for her.  

They refused the offer of food from the village, but ate cold meat and hard bread from a chest that was produced from the rear of the wagon.  They sat around the fire in silence while they ate.  Only when their meal was finished did they bring nourishment to the accused.  Two of them carried the tin tray into her, their swords drawn aswell.
The cloaked man ate alone, sitting quite close to the river with his back to the camp.  The driver also ate alone, sitting on his wagon.  After he had finished his meal and before the sun had finished setting, the driver walked down and sat down beside the cloaked man.  The cloaked man was staring into the water, his hat in his hand.

“Another day and we will be in Alsongburg,” the driver said by way of greeting.  The cloaked man did not respond.  “I'll be happy when this is behind us.”  

“If they try and free her, it will be tonight,” the cloaked man said slowly.  He put his hat back on his head and stood up.

By the time the last flickers of light had disappeared, the people of the village had drifted back to their homes.  The templars refused the offer of shelter and positioned themselves around the prison of their charge.  Two stood at each corner while another two and the cloaked man stood at the entrance.  Each of the templars stood the same way, their spear pointed towards the sky, their shield held close to their bodies and their helmets on.  Their eyes were downcast, their heads were bent in prayer, their lips moving soundlessly.

No moon or stars rose to replace the sun.  The light from the fire flickered and darted into the darkness.  The templars lit candles and torches and placed them around the witch's prison in brass lamps heavily engraved with symbols of protection.  Heavy shutters had been placed on the windows of each of the houses and blocked any light coming from them.  The cloaked man walked around the prison, stopping at each pair of templars long enough to nod to them and then continued on.

The night grew steadily colder and a stiff breeze started to blow.  It rattled off the houses and squeezed through the cracks of the walls.  The cloth of the witch's prison started to flap and flutter, rising up close to the ground.  The templars moved swiftly, dragging the cloth back to the ground and using their daggers to pin it down.  Their job done they returned to their posts, forming a ring of steel and timber.  Surrounding the cage.  They closed the panels on the lamps, trying to prevent the wind from blowing them out.  The wind attacked the lamps like it was targeting them.  The flames of the candles flickered  and went out.  The templars tried silently to re-light them, failing more often than they were successful.

Inside the prison the witch cowered against the post, her hands held together and her head bent.  As the wind rose it started to whistle shrilly.  It whipped back the cloak of the cloaked man to reveal a black leather tunic under it and two cross  belts of throwing knives.

“Leave the lamps,” the cloaked man bellowed over the sound.  “Take your positions.”  The templars obeyed him swiftly and the temporarily broken circle of steel reformed.

Outside the protected circle of light creatures formed.  Creatures born from darkness and twisted by it.  They rose from the ground, descended from the sky, slithered from under the rocks and splashed from the water.  They twisted and twirled in great circles around the prison, morphing all the time.  One second they were almost shapeless, blowing like burnt paper in the wind, half hidden by the darkness.  The next second they were solid and earth bound, plodding forward with heavy earth shaking footsteps, giant collections of mass with red, burning eyes.  The next again they were fleeting and slick, sliding through the air or along the ground.  Sometimes they formed into crowds, snarling forward with gnashing teeth and slashing claws.  Other times attempting piercing single attacks against lone members of the templars.  They never entered the light but stayed on the very edges of it, always half hidden by the darkness.

The templars met them with stoic gazes and statuesque figures.  Hard eyes glinted from behind their face guards, never blinking, never being cast aside.  Ignoring the cold, they held their torches aloft in an attempt to spread the light.  Behind them, in the prison, the witch cackled or whimpered repeatedly, though without any obvious connection to events outside herself.

The first rays of sunlight burned through the creatures and, without the darkness to protect them, they fled.  The templars stood in position until the sun had fully risen and then they breakfasted quickly on cold meat and bread.  The witch was escorted back into the prison wagon and the post pulled up.  The procession lined up to continue on its way.

The cloaked man tossed a few silver coins onto the ground beside the shrine of Tine.  He could feel the eyes of the villagers on him, though none had dared to leave their homes.  
“They tried to frighten us, not rescue her,” he said, speaking to the statue of Tine in the small shrine.  “Why would they do that?”  He waited for a second and then shrugged.  Why did evil do anything?  He spurred his horse and caught up with the slow moving procession.

The winter sun hung low in the morning sky; it had barely breached the tree tops and yet it was almost at its zenith. Sunbeams darted out amongst the snow-burdened pines and spruces of the Arden; a dazzling array of luminous lances thrusting out of the mists towards them. The three brothers set out at first light; it was Amadeus’ sixteenth-winter, and he was both terrified and excited at the prospect of breaking a mature male rimedeer, a rimestag, just like his brothers had on their sixteenth-winters.

Amadeus could still hear the distinctive sound of steel rasping on steel. He took a deep breath of mist-ridden air, sighed, and then looked across to his brother. Man and mount clad alike in plate his brother looked ready for a mêlée, not a stag hunt.

“Amaranth, you said you were going to stop that.” his brother had adjusted his furs in an effort to dampen the sound, but it had made little difference.

“It matters not anyway; Arasmes is likely well ahead of us, and I’d wager he could sneak up on a rimestag with a bell around his neck.”

At the familiar crunch of permafrost under-hoof behind them, they turned and drew steel together in a single motion.

Unflinching at the bared steel, Arasmes grinned triumphantly at his two brothers, “Ah, wonderful brothers, did I startle you. Amadeus and Amaranth couldn't help but smile as they sheathed their steel, Arasmes’ grins were infectious.

I don't say that to discourage...I don't think titles have the effect of those other pieces where people either will or won't be interested because of it. Instead it helps to categorize fantasy books.




I'll explain. Fantasy is a huge genre, it's really an umbrella term for many many subgenres that are often very different. I say I'm a fantasy reader but my list of books often only overlaps the next fan's by a few series or authors. We like different things, and look for different kinds of fantasy books.

When you walk into a bookstore or library, and skim the fantasy/sci-fi section, there are a few things that get each individual to pick up a book. Here's the thing to remember: all of those books probably get picked up long enough for the back cover or first paragraph to be read....but the books are being picked up by very *different* people. 

For example. If I see a fantasy book with a shirtless guy with a sword called the Prince of Fantasycountryname I am *not* picking it up. But that's just me. It's very likely that this exact same book is the first to catch the interest of ten other readers right behind me. And that's great.
However, if I see something with a silhouette of a bird over a landscape with a silhouette of a tree or something called, I don't know, something slightly mythical that doesn't reference any specific characters or have any fantasy names in it, I'm going to pick that up and read the first chapter, no problem. Because that's the kind of book I like, and that cover, and that title, clue me in that it fits the subgenre of my choosing.
And some people will pick up both, either one, and love them equally. And that's great too. But not everyone will, and if you are writing horror, or D&amp;D inspired, or something about dragons...clueing people in right away is the surest way to attract readers that are going to like your book.

So what is your title, for those of us with a WIP or first-draft or completed novel, and what's the cover going to look like? You don't have to have a cover designed, but in general you have a sense of what's going on there.

TL;DR: The cover and title of your book tell people what subgenre of fantasy it is, and attracts certain readers, so tell us what you've got and why you chose it!",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_178bpx,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/178bpx/whats_the_title_and_cover_of_your_book_and_what/,

Since it's shaped out of a number of 'tribes' or major ancestral lines, the situation with the government is pretty different. Basically, one family line, which headed the largest most powerful 'tribe' in days gone by, has become something similar to a king and royal family, while the other ancestral lines have become something similar to nobles...but not quite.

My question is what should I call my ""royal family"". I don't want to use King Queen Prince Princess....I need some other term or terms.

Some examples...in Game of Thrones there is a Khal and Khaleesi, in Name of the Wind there's a Maer, in the Tawny Man trilogy Narcheska is used for something sort of tribal.

I've been trying to find translations in other languages of Chief and looking at baby name sites but I'm having trouble finding terms I like. If you all could suggest and brainstorm some options that would be incredibly helpful!

All is fine and dandy until one day a really bad guy becomes jealous that there are new, young things in the world and he is not one of them. So he goes down to the giants' workshop and tells them to stop working or he will kill them (he's also really powerful, maybe like a wizard or something), so of course, they stop. Now nothing new can ever be made again, and the whole world is beginning to rot.

I'm writing an 'Urban Fantasy' where some 20-something characters from our world have the wool over their eyes removed that shows them the that magic is real and such. (Think a non-government version of Men in Black- with fantasy creatures instead of aliens just to keep things short.)

Here are my issues.

1) The transition between our world into the new one. I want the characters to put on a helmet, lift the visor and BOOM- Magic time. This is because a select few relics play a key role.

But I don't like the general 'Go to the museum and....' Its been done to often (Spiderman, Percy Jackson and such)

2) Establish characters sooner.
Currently it takes 4 chapters for the first sign of magic- that's WAYYY to long to get to the awesome parts. What tips do you have for a story like this for getting the action going quicker? I don't want to just say 'Everything was normal and then BOOM' but it needs to be quicker than it is.

3) My idea is when you can see the magic, you can now perform it. No restrictions. Whatever your natural abilities (Throw a football really well) are, that now transitions into your magic abilities (Throw a fireball really well) without the pesky go to school/learning curve. Of course there is a price to use magic, but my question is this - How would you reveal characters natural abilities in a way that isn't to obvious?

I know I'm being vague , I'm not trying to be secretive but figured if I kept it short I'm more likely to get a hand, please help me out and I promise to do what I can to return the favor!

Thank you!

EDIT: Here is a longer look at the story.

Currently I want this small group of characters (3 men, 1 woman) to meet up with another female character and her dad. This is where the above problem of the 'transition' happens. This daughter and father combo have a helmet, that when put on your head, and the visor lifted will remove 'The Shroud' basically your blindfold from the magic around you.

There are 5 other magic relics (all based from the same suit of armor) around the world that they are hunting down. Magic has a cost. Every time you use it, you lose a memory. Small things like what you had for breakfast for a small spell but the bigger the power the more you lose. Leaving the craziest seemingly drunkest old hobbo's you would see walking around town to be some of the most powerful crazy people ever.

Fast forward, the dad is evil and trying to use the helmet as bait to bring out the other relics. A few other character join up with the group (A relic hunter gargoyle, group of centuar's that one of the main characters [in a wheel chair] becomes obsessed with) to fight the dad.

Here are the relics thus far:

Helmet - Removes the Shroud (The dad has this)
Sword - You get the power of the last person killed with it. (Giant plot hook with this)
Chest piece - You're immune to losing memories from magic (The gargoyle has this currently)
I would like to have 2 more relics, but I'm not sure what they would do at this time.

I would like to try and come up with something different than that.  But I think I need some help in getting it up and going.

I have this idea of a thing I am calling the Qunitessence.  Basically it is a combination of our world's dark matter and Star Wars' Force.  It is a basic building block of the multiverse.  All things come from it and it is a part of everything   It is a force, it is energy and it is matter.  Even those that know it best cannot truly define it.  

From the Quintessence all sources of magic originate.

Psionics harness it from the inside.
These powers are usable with little more than a though.  This also actually makes the user a little more superior than others because of the ability to manipulate this internal energy/power.

Arcane manipulates it from with out.
These powers or spells must be used by drawing in external energy and manipulating it.  Words and gestures must be used.  This weakens the user over time as the cost of using outside energies.

Divine borrows it from an outside intermediary.
These powers are accessed through prayer and worship.  The user borrows energy from a more powerful outside being.  The cost paid is worship to a higher power.

The three main characters (that I have so far) are actually pretty well fleshed-out, and I'll put their descriptions underneath:

&gt;Coldrich Academy, a place of study for spellcasting apprentices. Built in a secret location deep within the Boros Mountains, it is a place where young mages come to learn their craft and become fully fledged Sorcerers. At least, that’s what the lay people of the kingdom of Derulan are told anyway. To the mages within its stone walls, however, Coldrich is a prison. Young boys and girls who were found to have magical ability are brought there against their will under the orders of a tyrant king. Forced to learn how to use their powers for war, they are forever cut off from their homes, families, friends, and society as a whole.

&gt;Seventeen-year-old Elissa Caldwin was brought to Coldrich when she was little more than a year old. Convinced by the Magerate, (the people who govern magic in Derulan,) that she was orphaned at a young age, and was “saved” from spending her years in an orphanage, she remained grateful to the Academy. That is, until only a year before her graduation exams, when a young boy was brought in from her home town hints that the truth of her origins may be much more sinister. With this new boy, and her best friend’s help, she learns the horrible truth, which shatters her trust in the Magerate. With this new hatred, she escapes the prision-like walls of Coldrich with her two friends into an unfamiliar world, vowing to return and make changes for the betterment of all mages.

&gt;What they find, however, is that outside the walls are more dangerous than they could have imagined. A war torn country, ravaged by battles between Derulan, and other ~~human, elven, and dwarven~~ nations in King Norvec’s hunger for conquest. Within it, rumors of rebellion have begun to emerge from the depths of society. The three mages discover that it is a cruel world outside of Coldrich, and surviving it may be too much for them to handle...

The third paragraph is kinda vague, because, well, the plot is a little unfinished after they leave the academy. And by a little, I mean very much. 

So are there any issues? Any ideas for things that could be added? Any ideas for things that could happen after they escape (as I'd consider almost anything)?

I'm afraid my men might be a bit girly. 

Mostly it's in small details about how they interact with other characters. I sometimes struggle to find ways for them to react to things other characters (particularly women) without them coming across as way too shy. 

Even when I'm really trying hard to avoid this the interactions an dialogue that I'm writing seem a little bit awkward, and a little bit off. 

So, I figured I might as well ask if the collective wisdom of r/fantasywriters has any tips for writing believable male characters - especially when it comes to how they should interact with others, both male and female. 

FYI, my major male characters are all knights and/or lords. This includes one of two protagonists, the second protagonist's love interest and the antagonist (who I've been pretty pleased with so far - I can pull off being a dick well enough, apparently). The protagonist is a teenage knight-to-be, who we follow as he grows from boy to man, while the love interest is a teensy bit older (mid-twenties) and entering his peak.

We'll start with the basic idea of gathering redditors' fantasy work, and refine it depending on how it's received after issue number 0. I'm thinking perhaps just a single ~10,000 word piece per issue, a few pieces of flash fiction if anyone's got it, with some standard 3000-5000 word stories--but that's just an idea. There's also the idea of including the monthly writing challenges--as blowing_chunks already has, let me know if we can include your winning piece.

For our first edition, it will be released for free, and hopefully advertised on other subreddits. Should it look as professional as it I believe it will, as well read equally impressive, we can discuss charging for it. And remember: chances are once it's published like this, others won't accept it for publication elsewhere. Be wary!

So PM me your short stories, excerpts, poetry, or even fantasy art (if you'd like to see it turned into a cover--I like the idea of the subreddit logo as part of the title). There's no theme/topic this time around, so the guidelines are basic: fantasy. I've already got two stories, both around 6000 words, so if someone's piece goes much over that, I think it should be the only one. Again, this can all be discussed after we release issue one.

Don't be shy with submissions! If I don't receive very many, then there will be pretty much zero selection process. All are welcome to write, submit, and suggest ideas for the project, as is anyone else who would like to sort through the stories with me if there's a surplus (I'm by far a professional editor/writer, I just want to see something like this get off the ground).",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_wn4c1,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/wn4c1/submit_by_july_29_rfantasywriters_premiere/,

And it's going pretty well for someone who's never done this before, dungeon mastered, or written anything since the equivalent of college. I work pretty systematically. I need this to be consistent from the ground up, and I've got multilayered rough timelines of ten thousand years of history, tables of magic effects, tables of key characters, key moments … I simply fill in the blanks.

But this was supposed to be a platform, and soon I want to write. So now there's mapping out a story. Systematically.

Movies I get. There's three acts, and they go something like this: Get your hero up a tree, throw rocks at him, then get him down. You introduce a character, perhaps he's in the middle of something thrilling. Let him rest on a branch, letting him, and the audience, breath. Then suddenly: danger! Someone starts flinging rocks at him. He has to dodge them and climb down to safety before he is struck and falls to the ground. And he probably makes it.

But I have a feeling that this stranded-whale-shaped dramaturgical curve is supposed to apply to a two hour narrative. How do I translate this to a book? As I said, I'm no big reader and do not have the same comprehension when it comes to hundreds of pages of written text.

How do I keep a narrative flowing? Game design-esque fifteen minutes of fun? Apply the movie model of three acts? Go by feeling?

The sun broke through the treetops here, sending warmth into my body with every step. These old trees served as my first toys when growing up, the hollowed out oaks were fortresses ready to be defended by brave knights, the tall slender ones were our flag poles, telling the world of our massive empire, and either to bend to us or face a merciless and swift defeat. 
But today they were merely a backdrop to me. My family has been dipping into our reserve food, and it has barely been the first month of winter. I needed to find food, and fast. Anya was soon to be weaned off my mother, and she needed the meat badly. 
And there, just in the corner of my eye I saw it, a majestic stag. If I moved one more inch he would have seen me. Damn me and my wandering mind. But I believed I could get him. Crouching down, and slowly pulling a arrow from my quiver, making every muscle movement a calculated action, I pulled back the arrow. I'd done this hundreds of times, father teaching me everything I need to know. Yet every time I fear I will miss, every time I am in this position self doubt sneaks in and tells me I am useless, but not this time. I held my breath and let the arrow fly. I heard its song sing to me as it whistled through the air. It him right in the heart. No one else could have made a better shot. I relaxed and started walking to the stag. Yet he had not fallen. He stood there waiting, arrow sticking out of him. This unnerved me greatly; he should have fallen. Then it hit me, no blood from the wound. He just stood there. Maybe he was frozen, a poor victim of being caught out in the winter night. I approached him, yet he breathed, and looked at me. He stared at me like no animal could. He gazed into my eyes, a wealth of unwanted knowledge showed in that moment. I quickly took out my dagger slashed his throat. He stood. 
I kicked him down and stabbed him again, a wild frenzy overtook me. I wanted no more than to hear his breath stop, to see his life pass from those wild eyes. As I started to slash his face, tears ran from my eyes. And he passed and I sat there, with gore on my hands, yet no blood. I removed the arrow, and it was clean, I rolled him over and that is when I saw it. His whole right side was covered in black boils, like fresh tar. It bubbled and burst. The smell was awful and I could feel myself start to gag. I turned my face and dry heaved for a moment. The old hags spoke of this, told us stories to hush the young ones at night. But no one believed it. The elder hunters and even elder priest swore to us it was real. They spoke of talking in alien tongues and walking on two feet, but they were simply ignored.

I've never posted anything like this before, please be gentle with me if you manage to wade through this wall of text. I apologise in advance for the scatter-gun approach of my stream of consciousness.

I've had the basic premise of this post living in my head for years. It hasn't had anywhere to go before now, I've never been in a writer's group and I left my creative-based university after six months, sparsely attending Creative Writing, crippled by doubts and that nagging feeling you get when you're too terrified to stick around long enough for someone to tell you you're not good enough, just in case they might be right.

Writing, for me, is my fiercest joy and cruelest master. I spend more time in the worlds I've forged than the real one. I have many real friends, the love of a wonderful man, but I have a lot of complicated relationships with people I have invented. The characters in my stories inhabit my head. I know where they were born and what colour their eyes are. I know what they think about when they wake up and how they react to pressure, grief, fear, joy. I have fallen in love with each and every one of them, though that has never been something which has edged into my actual life. I don't mean love in that sense. I have to love them to feel what they're feeling, otherwise it's hollow.

I have gone off on a tangent already. That's okay. This is basically a brain-fart I want to throw into the wind (Oh, mixed-metaphor, totally gross, better stand downwind for this) and if no one reads it, that's fine. I just need to get it out of my head otherwise it will give me no peace.

I marvel at people with the ability to wrangle their worlds and characters into structures and make a novel of them. Mine run free and I have no idea how to tame them. That's probably the wrong word for it. I have no idea how to manoeuvre them into the places they need to be to make a story rather than a series of scenes which play out over and over in my head.

How is possible? How can a book be tamed to paper? It just seems insurmountable to me.

You have an idea. But you can't just write. You need a world with continents and cities and towns and villages. You need to craft the economic and politic structure of these places, all of them. And the people! So many people, all with their own thoughts and dreams and plans, they have to be written too.

Your main characters need to be real, you need to know them inside out. You have to be able to love them and sympathise with them, even at their worst. You need to find the evil in you for some of them and tap into that. You need to know when to let them go, too, and how in the world do you murder someone you've fallen in love with?

Where do I start? Draw a map? Have an idea? When does the process of writing a novel actually become about writing? So many of my ideas and characters have faded because I don't know the answer to that question. I can't get it out of my head properly, I don't know the trick of it.

Whenever I think about it, I just see more and more things that need to be planned. My world will need a history, a rich and vivid history. Each town needs to have reacted to that history in some way. Who won? Who lost? What kind of money do they use and did they always use it? What came before? Why?

---

Audrad III af Hilmljar, Thirdsson – the Emperor-in-the-North
Audard [1], the third of his name, has ruled as Emperor-in-the-North [2] since the hundredth year after the great revolt. He is the first of the house of Hilmljar [3] to rule as Emperor, having slain a number of competitors and claimants so as to accede to the cilndun [4]. Audrad is notable as the first of the Llegian [5] Emperors to formally accept the treaty of Aunbey [6], though he made no effort to sign it or put it before the Imperial Diet. 

The border with Llewyr [7] was, however, treated as though it were the true frontier of the Empire, and thereby fortified in a manner similar to that which was stipulated in the treaty. A number of fortresses and outposts were built all along the border, with many leagues of forestland being cleared away so as to allow for their construction. 

--

Osmund Aumbrey – Ruler &amp; Warlord of Cislable
Osmund [8], the first known of his name, has served as the ruler and warlord of the fortress of Cislable [9] in the eastern reaches of Llewyr since the hundredth year after the great revolt. Osmund Aumbrey came to prominence first in the latter half of the final decade of the first century after the great revolt, he having carefully displaced a number of other local warlords and rulers. In the first few months of the new century, Osmund slew Harl Rolfsson [10], and became the undisputed ruler of Cislable and all its surrounding lands. 

Osmund is currently the only lord in Llewyr to rule both the twin keeps, having managed to maintain control over both the Cislable and the Sommersfast [11]. As such, Osmund has full control over the eastern end of the river Ausable [12], and the lucrative smuggling routes there.

--

Magvarr the Younger, Mikkelsson – Ruler &amp; Warlord of the Hlensengung, Imperial vassal
Magvarr [13], the first known of his name, has served as the ruler and warlord of the Hlensengung, the Great Northern Forest in Llewyr, since the eighty-ninth year after the great revolt. Magvarr, at fifty-nine, is one of the oldest rulers in Llewyr, and has managed to hold onto practically all of the territories which he started with. He is known as an excellent leader of men, and a man with a careful eye for detail – his reputation cemented further by his various honest dealings with his fellows Llewyric lords and rivals. 

In the ninety-fifth year after the great revolt, Magvarr defeated a battalion of Imperial troops [14] slightly east of the hill-fort of Etrinsfast [15]. There, Magvarr crushed an incursion that had begun decades earlier, and killed the man that had been appointed imperial governor of the territories. As such, the Empire offered Magvarr the title of imperial vassal – supplying him with arms and additional prisoners, such that he pledges to continue to maintain, in perpetuity, the border between the Empire and Llewyr. 

--

Llaerahd Scricdir – Ruler &amp; Warlord of the Maylron
Llaerahd [16], the first of her name, has served as the ruler and warlord of the Maylron, the western flatlands, since the ninety-fourth year after the great revolt. She first came to prominence as the wife and business-partner of one of the leading local merchants, owning her very own mercenary band with money earned through smuggling ventures. 

---

[1] - Audard – A common name in the north, especially amongst the nobility. Translated, it means “noble one” in an older dialect of Dacic. It is interesting to note that the first Emperor by the same name, his own reign having started a hundred and fifteen years prior to the great revolt, had to face similar challenges when ascending to the cilndun.

[2] - Emperor-in-the-North – The traditional title of the ruler of the Empire of the North. By using such a title, the Empire avoids claiming hegemony over the entirety of the northlands (though it does de-facto possess such), and allows for further expansion in other directions. This title has weakened the Empire and the Emperor both on several occasions, as it has been one of the primary reasons for the various revolts and uprisings that have taken place within the Empire from time to time.

[3] - Hilmljar – A newer house, having been founded merely fifteen years after the great revolt by Hilml the Silent. The house has achieved significant wealth and influence over the past hundred years, primarily through its careful manipulation of the situation in Llewyr. 

[4] - Cilndun – The bronze crown. The traditional headpiece of the Emperor-in-the-North is a plain band of bronze, studded with iron and silver. A line of gold wraps around the top of the crown, serving as its primary decoration. There are several legends which explain the rather mundane nature of the cilndun. In general, they all agree that the first Emperor was a modest man.

[5] - Llegian – Emperors serving after the Great Revolt.

[6] - The Treaty of Aunbey – The treaty signed in the aftermath of the Emperor Vaenig's defeat and demise at the battle of Walcir. Llewyr was made a neutral territory and buffer-zone between the southern counties and the Empire of the North herein, with a number of other clauses and stipulations which put severe limitations upon the Empire's power to go to war and expand further.

[7] - Llewyr – The buffer-zone created between the Empire of the North and the southern counties, generally following the course of the river Ausable right up to the coastline. The duchy of Wesyrn, the counties of Thasse and Ungren, the kingdom of Falcirc, and the free city of Angron all border Llewyr to the south and to the west. The Empire of the North spans Llewyr's entire northern boundary. 

[8] - Osmund – A fairly common name in Wesyrn, particularly amongst the lower classes. The origin of the name is unknown, but it generally is associated with good luck. 

[9] - Cislable – One of the few stone fortresses left within Llewyr. It stands beside the Angry Mountain, Thorpeim, upon a low plateau. It previously served as an important outpost for the Empire of the North, though it has changed hands several times after the signing of the treaty of Aunbey. Its most recent ruler is Osmund Aumbrey.

[10] - Harl Rolfsson – The son of Rolf Baercsson, Harl inherited Cislable from his father, a rare occurrence in Llewyr. He had ruled for only a single year prior to his death at the hands of Osmund Aumbrey. 

[11] Sommersfast – One of the few stone fortresses left within Llewyr. It stands on the opposite side of the Angry Mountain, Thorpeim, from its twin, Cislable. It guards the northern half of the east end of the river Ausable, whereas Cislable guards the south.

[12] Ausable – The river which runs through the entirety of the lost lands, starting at the Roegllr Range and spilling out at the Bay of Dogs in Angron.

[13] Magvarr – A common name in the north, particularly amongst the lower class.

He chortled to himself and took another swig of his home-brewed mushroom ale, then proceeded to bang the nearly empty flask on his dented helmet.  ""Where be me pipe?

They blazed like an evil lighthouse and came to a stop.  +*Another word dwarf and you will become a permanent fixture of this place.  We are not alone.*+   The bumbling dwarf froze, blinked, and re-adjusted his helmet quickly.  Psy-speak.  He gave his helmet a slight tap.  It had cost a small fortune and was supposed to ward against all sorts of mental trickery.  The dwarf frowned and sucked his teeth.   +*The pathetic enchantment on your hat will do nothing here...and keep your thoughts civil.  Half-man.*+

The caravan was well disciplined.  There were a few screams from the slaves, but the contracted mercenaries handled themselves honorably. Cross-bolt darts glittered silently in the darkness, coated with all varieties of deadly poison.  A mercy bolt put the poor dwarf out his misery.

This concerns me, since I just hit 180k and I still have a ways to go.  I've been aiming for 300k but I suspect it's actually going to fall somewhere around 260, 270k all told.

Her advice was to take my first novel and just split it into two.  This will look good to the agents and editors because I'll have TWO books of (what would then be) a 4 book series done, instead of one huge tome of a planned trilogy.  I'm concerned that doing so will negatively impact the character and plot arcs, though.  I've gone into this with the express intent of it being one book and I'm just not sure if the plot would have a satisfying conclusion should I split it in half.

I know that it'll be hard to judge based on brief descriptions, but here goes.  Any thoughts you guys might have would be more than welcome.  (There are, of course, other characters and subplots and so forth, but I will leave those out for the purposes of this summary and focus on the two main characters.)

In the course of the book, we have an assassin character who has been ordered to kidnap a woman and bring her to his master.  He convinces her to accompany him willingly, but halfway to the city where he is to meet his master and hand her over, he realizes that he has been brainwashed.  His anger over the brainwashing (and years of lost memories) wars with his fear of his master.  They enter the city (which is in the midst of falling to the master's forces) and the assassin decides that he will help her to escape instead of turning her over.  The city falls in smoke and fire as they escape, but he knows that his master won't let this defiance go unanswered and will hunt them down.

This is the first half.  **Do you think, based on this brief description, that it could stand alone as its own novel?**  The second half ends with an actual physical battle between the assassin and his master.

I'm working on two stories, and in one I took a game-of-thrones-like approach in terms of a massive number of main characters. The nature of the world in the story allows me to get many characters involved as I please. I'll only name the main character throughout the entire story

Devon Lancoon: Devon's a 17 year old teenager, who's life is plunged into a chaos when, in a bout of insanity, his father kills his mother and himself, orphaning Devon. Devon is unfairly accused of the crime and the corrupt government tries to execute him unfairly without trial. During said execution, Historic powers awaken within him, and he realizes he has obtained the power of someone known as a vessel: a person who has obtained the powers of a elemental spirit. He manages to escape, forcing him to run from the government hunting him down, and cant even be seen in his home country, on his journey, he meets others with powers and situations like his, and realizes his situation spans far more than running from a corrupt government. He finds himself encompassed in a conspiracy involving an organization taking over governments, and realizes he must gather all those with powers like his to save the world from destruction.

In terms of personality, Devon is a confident, steadfast, and yet gentle person. He does everything he can for those around him, taking the position of leader when nobody else wants to. Even when the burdens of leadership weigh him down, he makes sure he breaks down out of the sight of his peers, so their confidence in him doesnt waver. He's the vessel of music, and as such has a deep abiding love for music and just the sounds around him in general. His love for the world, humanity, and music allow him to find optimism in the bleakest of situations, yet even he can be broken in times of tragedy, such as losing a loved one, and can be very serious at times that require it

I have two main characters for the story I'm currently writing.

Carter (name to be changed) is a 16 year old boy studying to be a Fusion (a type of magic in which weapons (blades, mostly) are fused with magical powers) Knight at the academy of Anerim, a military academy in the nation of Aneris (which his father is the headmaster of and a general of Aneris) that is at war with the only other country on the continent, Theesefields, accused of letting loose ancient monsters to commit acts of terror on Aneris. When the city and academy are subsequently demolished during a raid by monsters, Carter finds himself with nowhere to go, his friends dead, and his father nowhere to be seen. He sets out on a journey to find his mother to stay with, but in the process becomes involved deeply in the war between the two nations, and begins to question if the side of his friends and family is the right side at all. His journey spans and unravels the buried creation story of the continent, creating a conflict that stretches to hell and heaven.

In terms of personality, Carter is a friendly, kind, and popular kid at the Knights Academy of Anerim, but is somewhat softspoken and shy around strangers, and doesnt outwardly try to make friends outside the ones he already has. Carter's a very skilled fighter, and the best in his class. He is very simple-minded about worldly issues, and as such finds war and conflict/politics to be pointless and stupid, but chose his contradictory career as a knight out of passion and patriotism for his country as well as being pressured by his general father. He is overwhelmed and thrown into shock when Aneris is destroyed, and grows to hate Theesefields for it's alleged release of monsters. He struggles with the loss of his friends, and for the first time is placed in a situation where he must fend for himself. He's very passionate about what he believes in, and will throw himself into denial when something he has believed in strongly is proven wrong.

The second main character is Grace, another student at the Knights Academy, although she is studying to be a Raw Mage (draws magic from within her, rather than using a weapon to be a vessel for the magic like fusion knights). Her relation to Carter is merely as a friend of a friend, and they have spoken, but not extensively. Grace has a very warm, welcoming personality, despite being very softspoken and overwhelmingly gentle. She doesn't speak often around people she isn't comfortable around, but is a good judge of character and will act towards a person immediatley as she analyzes them. She's very loving and cares for all, even those who dont know her. When Anerim is destroyed in the attack, she finds her friends dead as did Carter, and as a result clings onto him as the only person she has left. She sees him struggling to cope with the epic loss, but is not the confident enough personality it would take to help him cope with his issues. She starts to grow more and more on Carter, and vice versa, and through their trials and tribulations grow to be an inseparable pair. She is more people smart than Carter, and is often the one to talk to strangers and get things done for them. Through their travels, Grace discovers the truth about her ancestral origins, and finds herself to be a figure in a conflict much more heavenly. than that of man.

Not the insistent, percussive roar of a mid-winter storm; there was now sudden, saw-toothed lightning tearing the sky, no echoing roar of thunder, no morse-code messages tapped out on weary rooftops. It was raining, a soft  summer squall, blown about between drunken tenements, carried on the gentle fingertips of an urbane, domesticated wind. The city shifted and danced in the gloaming, distorted and softened. It was a desert-hermit’s maddening mirage: empty streets and the warmth of gas-lit windows. The rain fell, to wash away the grit and the grime, to wash the drunks and the prostitutes indoors, the great alcoves beneath bridges suddenly crowded.

A baptism, of sorts, washing away the city’s sins. 

As if those stains could be washed away.


###

She walked slowly though Old Town, down Segerak Road, past Three Point park, her geta sandals *click-clack*ing down Burgess Street and Buttermere Lane, winding toward the river. Walking alone, unseeing, trapped by her thoughts, she traced a meandering path through the slums of Sparrow’s Fort and Teachly. A nocturnal wandering, down thoroughfares named for long-dead Generals and Senators, the near-forgotten heroes of the First Republic, her footsteps muttered, muffled prayers to the once-glorious. 

The smell of the river was strong here, the smell of dank mud and the churning, rising waters. The river rages, as melt-water and the days of rain fuels  its fury. Higher and higher up the bank it reaches, waging endless war against the heavy stone walls restraining it. Eventually the river would win. Across the black water stretched Quaker’s Bridge, a garish, Baroque monstrosity, reaching out as if to drag the middle-class respectability of Crowswood and the sweeping, crenulated dome of Saint Oswyth’s Tabernacle into the mire of their lower-caste cousins. 

She stopped, abruptly. Took in the twinkling lights of Foxminster, burning as bright and as unattainable as the stars. She looked away, melancholic. Into the patchwork, ever-changing tapestry of the River.
 
It reflected back those earthy heavens, cruelly impersonal.

She hadn’t heard his shuffling footsteps in the night, mirroring her own, hadn’t heard his delirious, frantic whispers – if she had she may have been more wary, more on-edge. Although, perhaps not. In a city the size of Khoi-salang the mad tread the same paths as the righteous. Or, in this specific case, the mad tread the same paths as whores, or the ladies of the night, whichever you’d prefer to call them. 

“Oi, love! Wotcha cost?” 

She hadn’t heard his approach, and his sudden voice in the darkness startled her. She turned, twisted her pox-marked mask into a brittle smile. The Great Bells of the city began to sing, calling out for midnight’s onset – first Saint Oswyth’s brassy contralto, then the booming bass voice of Tennial-on-Crimp’s, the echoing Hell’s trumpet screech of the temple to Ghâl the Jawless. Near-empty streets hummed with the reverberations.

He drew his cruel little knife.

The Bells sung on.

The first chapter is still an unpresentable clusterfuck which I am in the process of rewriting entirely. But here's what you need to know going into the second chapter:

* The Teorgsi (which are featured in this chapter) have been fighting wars on 1-3 fronts for all of known time. They are ""warlike"".

* On this planet, there are six gods. They each have independent bodies of followers. Five are gods of land, and one is the god of the sea. The sea god's followers are split into two factions, one of which (the Godless) is the antagonist in the Teorgsi's Unending/Forever War (might change name). 

* A saying in this world with respect to gods is ""Where there is land there is man, where there is man there is god."" This refers to the interdependence in the existence of these three things. You may kill a god by killing all of his people, and land will sink into the sea if no person is occupying it.

That is all. Thank you for any feedback you would be willing to give and don't feel like you have to sugar coat your advice.  I'm here to improve!

Chapter 1: Prophecy Shmophecy 

In a magical land far away, where for some reason English was the common language, there lived a king in his dark castle.  The dark castle sat in a dark forest, surrounded by swirling clouds.  This king had a thing for stealing from the young, picking on the old, and would occasionally force himself onto any woman of his liking.  In other words, he was a bit of a cunt.  But he was damn fine looking, so that made it alright.  

One day, tired from sitting around and touching himself, he decided he’d be a little more productive.  He was to go to the nearby village and backhand anyone insolent enough to not pay their taxes at double the agreed upon rate.  It had to be done because in his words ‘times were tough’ – for them.  He carefully put on his golden crown, because how else would people know he was king?  Off he rode on his dark horse, into the dark night - his cape flapping in the wind.  He disappeared into the forest below.

As he galloped along in a blaze of glory, the low hanging branches began clawing at his face.
‘Oh for fucks sake,’ he said, as a branch slapped him in the eye.  He stopped his horse and slumped off, rubbing his face in an almost sulking manner.  As he opened his eyes, his vision focused on a mysterious figure in a cloak that smoked softly.
‘Who’s there?  Speak!  This is the kings’ kingdom.  And I’m the king!’
The cloaked figure gave a little curtsy.  ‘Oh good king,’ it said.  Its voice shimmered in an ethereal manner. ‘I am but a humble servant to this land, and to you.’
‘Well, yes, I should think so.  Now remove your hood so I can see your face, loyal servant.’
‘I’m afraid I cannot.’
‘You refuse a direct order of the king?!  What sort of blasphemy is this?’  He grabbed the cloak and flung it over.  But what he saw, or rather didn’t see, surprised him.  The cloak simply fell to the ground, as if nothing was ever under it.
‘I know what this is,’ said the king, in a ruminating voice.  ‘Blacks magic.  If there’s anything I cannot tolerate in my lands, it’s blacks.’
‘Magic?’  said the figure, who had reappeared near him, cloak and all.
‘I know what I said.’
‘I have grave news, my liege.’
‘Well, hurry up about it, I have important business to attend to,’ he said, stroking a money pouch hanging from his belt.
‘There is a young boy...’
‘Why tell me this?  I’m a king, not a priest.’
‘They say he is the chosen one that will one day claim the sword of legend and kill the king, you, and lead the realm into a future of happiness and prosperity.’
The air frosted over as the kings mad eyes widened.
‘Is that so?  Some little shit thinks he can come into my kingdom and give it hope?  Oh, this will be fun,’ he said, clenching his fist, ‘I’ll smash him to pieces, whether he’s wearing glasses or not - I don’t discriminate.’
‘The child is at the tender age of thirteen, it should be no problem.’  
‘Can I ask you one thing?’
‘Of course.’
‘Why is it always a boy?  Why can’t it ever be a girl that comes after me?  A sexy one, mind you.  Nobody needs ugly heroines running around.’
‘… Is that a rhetorical question?’
‘No, I’m asking.’
‘I… I don’t know.’
‘Right, well if he’s the chosen one, he’ll no doubt get all the help he needs, the self-entitled bastard.’
‘I believe his mother and father are happily married and love him dearly.’ 
‘He’s not from a broken home?  What sort of fantasy is this?  Regardless, let’s level the playing field a bit, shall we.’
The king revealed a map from his royal, red robe.
‘Let’s see… a-hah!  How about the wise, old sage that resides in the forest of the fairies?  He can help me.’
‘I’m afraid he only works with heroes.’
‘What?  That’s preposterous!’ 
‘There’s not much he can do, it’s in his contract.’
The king furrowed his brow and continued eyeing the map.
‘I know, I can go to the fire dwarves of the eastern sands and get a magical weapon of my own.  The kid won’t expect that!’
‘They don’t like white people over there.’
‘Oh, for goodness sake!’ said the king, throwing his hands up in frustration.  ‘Fine, I’ll go to the retired knight Gandlin, the best the land has ever seen.  Surely he’ll see something special in me that will prompt him out of retirement one last time to teach me the ways of unlocking my true potential I never knew existed through motivational montages, so that I may defeat a boy less than half my age.’
‘I think he’s already helping the child.’
‘Oh come the fuck on!  How is this fair?’
‘Surely, a great king the likes of you does not need the help.  After all, the boy is just that, a boy.  Let him run around, it won’t do him any good.  Now that you know of his plans, you can deal with him in a way you see fit.’
‘Perhaps you’re right, hooded plot device,’ said the king, a twisted grin growing across his handsome face.  ‘Prophecy shmophecy!  I’ll show him what happens when one goes against King Gillitus.  I’ll show them all!’  He laughed maniacally as he got back on his horse.  ‘If this boy thinks he’s getting a happy ending, he walked into the wrong parlour.’


 
Chapter 2: Spotty-Faced Virgin

Surrounded by a fort of musty, old books and gadgets sat an old man in purple robes and a floppy wizard hat that tickled the floor at the tip.  He stroked his cat in thought, as it nestled comfortably in his beard.  The potions in front of him snapped, crackled and popped.
	‘I think I may have it, Gimi!’ said the wizard.  The cat meowed.  ‘Indeed!  My weeks of labour are almost complete!’
	He carefully tipped the salve until a slither of it seeped into a flask beneath.
	‘Nearly…’ he said with bated breath, ‘Nearly…’
The front door slammed open.  Gimi jumped out of his beard, darting across the room, knocking over ornaments in her wake.
	‘Ahh!’ shouted the wizard, clutching onto his chest.  His potions lay smashed on the floor.  ‘Oh no... What have I done? What have you done!’ he said, turning to the door with an accusatory finger shaking.  Standing there was Gillitus.  ‘Oh, forgive me my king.  I didn’t know it was you.’
	‘I should hope not, I didn’t appreciate that tone.  What were you doing anyway?  Playing with your potions again?’
‘It was a very importan-’
‘Listen old man, I need you to do something for me.’
	‘Anything for you.  Anything, of course.’  He bowed multiple times as he spoke, trying to recover from his first offence of being rudely interrupted.
	‘Yes, yes, just shut up for a second.  I’ve heard that a boy is coming for me with a sword.  He intends to stick it through me.  I’m not into that sort of thing so I’ll need you to check if it’s true.  Perhaps look in a crystal ball or whatever else it is you wizards do.’
	‘There is something I can do.’
‘Then do it.’
‘Consider it done.’
‘Do it!’
‘Done.’
Gillitus followed the old wizard to a large stone cauldron on the roof of his oddly shaped turnip of a house.  The wizard took out an oak wand and waved circles above it.
	‘Milli… vanilli… show me something silly!’  The cauldron burped and spat as the water boiled.  A brief, inauthentic harmony escaped into the twinkling night sky.  ‘There, sire!  Do you see it?’ the wizard said as they both peered into the reflections of the cauldron.  ‘There he is, the boy.’
	‘This is it?  This is what fate has sent to end me?  Some pale, spotty-faced virgin?  Tell me, where is he now?’
	 ‘From what I can see, he is travelling across the dunwald plains.  He must be heading towards dragon valley.’
	‘Why would he go through that death-trap?’
	‘You said yourself that it was prophesied he would have a special sword, yes?’
	‘Well, that’s what I was told.’
	‘There is only one reason one would go to dragon valley, and one reason alone.  It is said to be the resting place of the sacred blade of Ahri, the world dragon.’
	‘I’ve heard of this world dragon before, but it’s just a myth, like women’s rights.’ 
	‘Not to alarm you, but if this boy were to get his hands on the blade, the power he would wield from it would be immense.’
If the old wizard was trying to spook him, it worked.  But he was never one to show his true feelings, and he wasn’t about to start now.
	‘Blade or no blade, I’ll crush him.’  His fake confidence was convincing, if to no one else but himself.  ‘I’ve seen enough.  I’ll go to dragon valley myself and deal with this once and for all.’ 
	The wizard showed Gillitus to the door.
	‘You’ve done your king a great service.  Once I deal with this boy, I’ll reward you handsomely.’
	‘My gracious king, I would not ask for a thing.  Paying service to you is reward enough.’
	‘Alright, no need to lay it on so thick.  And open some windows, it smells like cat piss in here.’
	‘Of course,’ said the wizard as the door closed in his face.  ‘You arrogant, blonde-haired twit!’  
The door opened again.
‘What was that?’ said Gillitus, his head popping in.
‘Oh, n-nothing.’
‘Right... Also, you should think about getting a lock on this door.’
The door slammed shut a final time.  The wizard wearily retreated back to the cauldron.  As he peered in one last time before emptying it, his eyes widened.  
‘I’ve made a terrible mistake…’
Quickly, he hobbled down the steps and across the room.  Throwing open the door, he jumped outside, but it was too late - Gillitus was already gone.

For those who comment, thank you very much!

Beyond the furthest vestiges of civilization, was a forest. It was not a forest of mighty pines and towering oaks, but rather the specter of a forest, the lingering remnant of a once vibrant entity. The imposing trees had died with everything else, and had overtime petrified, leaving the bark ashen pale, with branches grasping out in crooked poses, yearning for life when their final breath had long been exhaled. 

No animals flitted between the ferns and bushes of the undergrowth. They too, had left this mausoleum while it still retained its dignity. The only life which remained scuttled between the shadows, scavengers feeding upon the dregs of nature, consuming upon the rot and ruin.

Over time, the curse which had taken hold painted a morbid tableau with the most desolate hues. The shades of green found upon branches  faded into greys and browns, as the life slowly leeched out the soil, replaced with the cold stench of death.

A curse such as  this would not have been inflicted by mother nature, and its magnitude was beyond the ability of any earthly spirit. Instead, the pestilence emanated from within the forest itself, which slowly,  had been transformed into something resembling a crypt.

At the heart of this crypt, lay a tomb. Carved out of obsidian, it seemingly absorbed all light which touched it. Th  edges were rough hewn, chiseled quickly and refined only enough to provide a shape for the vessel. Its contours and surfaces were as pristine as the day it was laid upon the now barren earth, a testament to the fear which it inspired, rather than any reverence which it might have been paid. 

Residing within a circular clearing of the forest, no creeping vines or moss, which normally called this their domain, came near it. Instead, all  space in its vicinity was, lifeless, a fair demonstration of the power which it contained.

Locked within the ink-dark crypt was something ancient. It held no lineage or title, and the term human could no longer be afforded to it. 

A lingering reminder as to the dangers of forbidden knowledge, its mind had been corrupted. But rather than fight against the voices which whispered into its mind, it heeded their call, like a sheep to its shepherd. Having bent its knee to the alters of many a dark and festering horror, it soon found the rewards of loyalty. Its lords confided in It secrets long forgotten, and thus it transgressed where those of the mortal world should not, in search of greater power to satiate a never ending hunger.

Rife with power, it returned to the world which had abandoned it. Bolstered by the power of beings far beyond its comprehension, it waged war against the mortal world, pitting vile creatures it had dredged from the earth against the armies of men.  

Alas, while its magic rendered it immortal, its armies still fell prey to the weaknesses of flesh and blood. Though the numbers of its undead  far outnumbered the living men within their walled cities, the determination of Man could not be overcome. Cold steel slew its beasts, their black blood seeping into the ground from which they were drawn.

Eventually, even its arcane powers could not turn the tide of a losing battle.  Shaking the ground with their rhythmic march, armies from dozens of kingdoms marched upon its center of power, deep within this selfsame forest. Though the ranks of men stretched to either ends of the horizon, a single soul ventured forth into the maw of the beast. 

It is still not known how the Guardian brought low the undead master, but it was by his hand the the fiend lay upon the ground, defeat evident upon its grotesque features.

 But through the gifts it had been granted, it could not fall prey to the hangman's noose, nor the executioner's sword. And so it was locked away, to reside until eternity in a monument to its failure.

Millenia passed, and though the Reaper was unable to claim his price, the fangs of time were ever sharp. The years ripped flesh from bone, its body falling victim to forces of nature. And though its body rotted away, its mind remained keen. 

Upon its imprisonment, the only emotion to be found was anger, rage fueled thoughts which blew like hot dry winds across the barren plains of its mind. Over time, however, it found a gift within its solitude.

Time.

The time to think, and transcend the anger, that had gripped it. Slowly, it began to plot as it once had. A plan began to form, how it would return, and kill the the Guardian, who, legend said, still kept vigil outside the withered treeline.

Though it had been denied the world, the Lich would not be denied its vengeance. And all that required, was time.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,1374464054.0,,,True,t3_1isatw,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1isatw/critique_a_nervous_authors_first_post_intro_to_a/,

Example: I follow the main character around.

1373227355.0,6,self.fantasywriters,1htgyp,Any tips on making my inverted universe believable?,slish86,11,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1htgyp/any_tips_on_making_my_inverted_universe_believable/,"Hello fellow writers!

I'm a first time poster to this subreddit, and a first-timer at trying to write a book, so please have mercy on me. I have found so many helpful tips and links in this subreddit, so I thought maybe I'd dare asking for specific tips!

The thing is I'm currently in the planning stage of writing a fantasy. I one day had the idea of making a world based on the universe being inverted, with holes where the planets are now and solid mass filling  the rest of the universe. With slight alterations to this idea I've made a planet where magicians have made a livable hole inside the planet, an inverse planet basically. The hole is the size of a small planet, so it will feature continents, great bodies of water and I would also like for it to have different biomes. A magical sun of some sort would also be present in the middle of the hole. (Yup, the whole thing might be quite overboard, but please bear with me! I'm sure people have written stranger things in the fantasy genre)

Even though this is obviously very high fantasy stuff, I really want the world to seem real. So my question is, what steps can I take to make this believable? 

- What features would appear if one were to make such a large hole in a planet? If one side of the inverted planet were closest to the core of the real planet I'm guessing it would probably be riddled by volcanoes and a hotter climate, but what would happen on the other side? I'm no geologist, and if any of you reading this are geologists you are probably laughing at the absurdity of the all, but for the fun of it, any ideas on what might happen?

- Is it even plausible, or would the planet just collapse at some point? 

- How would the world be affected by basically never having night? Animals evolving differently, architecture bing changed, trees growing differently?

- How would gravity work? I've been thinking that if the outer planet is big enough, and there is enough mass on every side of the hole, that every part might have varying degrees of gravity. This would of course be very dependant on the dimensions of things, but is it plausible at all to have functioning gravity everywhere in the hole? I've been playing with the idea that there is no gravity, but instead the magical sun is always pushing with a force outwards from itself, creating an inverse gravity. I'd however like to refrain from explaining everything illogical with ""It's magic!"".

- Would weather work the same way as in a normal planet? Thinking about it, I'm sure never having nights would affect the weather. 

So if any of you could answer my questions, whether through real knowledge or good old guesswork and discussions, I'd be really grateful! I'm also aware that it might look like I'm wanting other people to write my book for me, but I feel that this is just such a little part of my story that it'll be okay to ask for some pointers.

Looking for any sort of feedback on this, and general reactions. It's the first part of my problem child story. I don't think I exactly went with the easiest POV to write from (first person, god). I can post more later if anyone is interested. The story picks up a bit, but this is the original nugget of story so I wanted to post it alone.

I marked it NSFW since there is sort of some energy being/god romance and I wasn't entirely sure if that counted or not.  ",,True,,t5_2t4ad,1370483570.0,,,True,t3_1fp3pg,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1fp3pg/the_god_and_the_girl_googledoc_looking_for/,

I've had an idea to write a novel that will use multiple first-person viewpoints to tell one story. I was inspired to do this after reading James Frey's *The Final Testament of the Holy Bible* which uses this technique and it's amazing.

The viewpoints would be from normal people, and would read sort of like diary entries/interviews, all revolving around the same incident/story. There would be no view point from the protagonist or antagonist.

Does this sound like something that would work in Fantasy? Or is it too experimental for a genre that holds dearly to its tropes and conventions?",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_1fn48d,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1fn48d/multiple_firstperson_viewpoints_in_fantasy/,

Akko fell back against the wall and slid to the floor, his eyes went to the mirror across the darkened room, visible by the dim light that shown from the crescent moon. Hair matted with sweat and dirt, nose broken, while from his lips, a linear streak of blood now trickled. He looked down, the blood seeping through his fingers as he held his stomach in an effort to slow the bleeding. He raised his head, leaning it back against the wall, and looked out of the window and into the night sky. While the possibility of death seemed to be an imminent reality; his thoughts turned to the disheartening revelation that had come upon him.

***

His breathing heavy, Akko watched as his Cloud Town opponent, struggled to his feet defiantly, lifting himself up from the earthen field on which the combatants fought. His brown and blue fighter’s uniform was greatly singed, while his face bore ash marks from an earlier attack by Akko. The crowd in the stadium was solidly behind Akko, cheering on who many felt would soon be the National Champion, sure that with the match in its final minutes, he would be taking the victory. With the match leaning in Akko’s favor, he knew that these last few minutes of action were more than enough time for his opponent to make a comeback. Looking at him now, Akko could see that this man held a desire to win that went deeper than advancing to the finals of this tournament. Akko hadn’t lost in singles competition in the past year, the opportunity to make it one step closer to the finals and tournament victory was ever present, but this guy was persistent. Seeing his opponent on his feet now, Akko brought his right leg behind his left, getting into position as he moved back into the counter form, a style he had been using much of the match against the fast and aggressive style of his opponent. The results of the match were shown on the Cloud Town competitor, hunched forward, he held his side as he took a step forward. In the same moment, Akko spun around, switching stances—seeing the moment’s hesitation, he struck out in swift fashion, sending a series of bursts of flame at his opponent, who was only able to roll out of the way, sliding along the ground out of harm. The dust from the flurry was mixed with an over usage of smoke from Akko’s fiery attack. The Cloud Town fighter scanned within the smoke, able to make out a silhouette just ahead, he brought his arms forward for an electrically charged forward strike. The lightning beam struck its mark, but as the smoke cleared, he saw that there was no body, as realization struck, he turned. Akko’s fist swung forward—his opponent’s arms came up in defense. Akko retracted his right arm at the last second, spinning around and bringing his backhand to the side of the fighter’s head, knocking him sideways. Akko followed the backhand with fiery punch that landed on the unprotected face of his opponent, who went flying back first into the dirt just as the referee called a stop to the match. Akko smirked, glancing at the clock; a pair of seconds more and it would have had to go to a decision, and Akko wanted to continue his string of decisive victories.

“Akko Adregi advances to the finals!” exclaimed the announcer over the PA system

The referee took Akko’s arm and raised it, proclaiming him the victor of the match to the thousands of fans in the stands of the Alter City stadium. He watched as his opponent rolled onto his front and lifted himself up from the ground. As he slammed his fist into the ground, Akko could see the frustration that shown on his face. The referee dropped his hand, and Akko waved to the cheering crowd in the stadium as he made his exit from the arena, giving one last glance back at the defeated fighter who now held his face in his hands; the smile left Akko’s face, he never liked that part of the job.
 
“Akko, over here,”

His friend Pietro stood just inside the tunnel that led down into the Alter City Stadium’s understage. The understage consisted of fighter’s rooms, training space, offices, and general areas as needed by the team. As he drew closer to Pietro, Akko saw that the look on his friend’s face was not that of congratulations, but of a serious manner. Pietro’s demeanor carried over to Akko as his friend’s pale blue eye’s looked into his own brown eyes.

“There’re some people here who really want to meet you,” Pietro said

From the tone of his voice, Akko could tell something was up.

“What’s the matter?”

Pietro let out a sigh as he ran his hand through his short white stringy hair, looking off before speaking in a hushed voice.

“What are you doing getting involved with the Aduri Syndicate?”

Taken aback by this, Akko gave a half laugh, looking at his friend for some sign of a kid, that the question made so accusingly, was a joke. Finding none, his brow furrowed.

“What are you talking about?”

“A pair of Aduri are waiting for you below,” Pietro replied, “mind filling me in?”

“When I find out myself, I’ll let you know.”

“So you’re telling me you know nothing of this?”

“No.”

Pietro thought for a moment before speaking, “I’ll come with you, but stay alert.”

Akko nodded before following Pietro down the steps and through the large metal doors that led to the understage. As the doors closed behind them, the sounds from the arena were muffled, replaced by the familiar bustle of fighters and staff activity; synonymous with a Match Day. They made their way through the halls, stopping outside of Akko’s room.

“They’re in my room?”

“Zephyr and your brother Ulrich are in there as well,” Pietro stated, opening the door

The four occupants turned to the new entrants, Ulrich stood leaning against the far wall, while Zephyr stood in the middle of the room with a man and woman who could only be the Aduri. Akko gave them both a once over, the man was nothing special, the average suited thug, though this one wore glasses; the bulge under his jacket suggested that he had a gun, something he was sure the others had spotted as well. The woman on the other hand, looked as if she had just walked off of the runway. Her striking red hair flowed down her back over a tightly fit overcoat; Akko couldn’t help but think it worked well with her figure.

“What’s this about then?” Akko asked

“They haven’t told us anything aside from wanting to speak with you,” Ulrich said, turning to the Aduri, “So what is it then?”

The woman stepped towards Akko, “We want to talk with you…Alone.”

“Not gonna happen,” Pietro said, crossing his arms

Akko put his hand on Pietro’s shoulder, “It’s okay, just wait outside until we’re done.”

“You sure?” Zephyr asked, eyeing the man

At Akko’s assurance, the others exited the room, leaving him with the Aduri.

“So spill,” Akko said

 “We’ve come with a proposition,” the woman stated

“What kind of proposition?” 

“Our leader has had his eye on you for some time now,” she said, “He sees you as a potentially great addition to our organization.”

“Not interested,” Akko replied

“These are pressing times Mr. Adregi,” she continued, “there are things in play that soon, if you’re not on the right side, you won’t make it very much longer.”

“Is that a threat then,” Akko asked

“No, we are but warning you of what is to come,” she said, “our leader feels that there are powers at play that concern all of us.”

“Maybe it concerns you guys, but I’m not in an Org, I’m not a criminal,” Akko said, “anything you guys do doesn’t concern me.”

“All of us,” she repeated, “including you.”

“Okay, I’ll humor you. Say I want to join, or I’m interested at least, what exactly would your boss want from me?”

“That, is something I cannot answer at this time,” she replied, “But whatever it may be, you will be well compensated for your service; you’d never need to work here again.”

Akko nods his head and puts his hand to his chin considering, “H’m so what I’ve got here is some Aduri big shot wants me in his crew for use of services that you obviously don’t know about, but it’s a part of this unknown that involves ‘all of us’ as you say. He sends you two, a woman—beautiful might I add, and the silent muscle,” Akko gestured to the man in the suit, “and once I join you, I’ll be making more money than I ever would here, am I following correctly?”

The woman remained thin lipped, so Akko continued “What your boss doesn’t understand is that I don’t do this because I have to—well no yes I kind of do otherwise I’m broke, but I enjoy what I do, I love it. And for your boss to even think I would dream of leaving this to go be some criminal lackey, he must be quite a fool to—

“Don’t you dare disrespect him!” her demeanor changed almost instantly, anger in her eyes as small wisps of fire twirled around her hands; her partner tensed, startled, went for his gun at the outburst.

Akko’s own hand shot out and held the Aduri’s hand against the gun, not allowing him to remove it, at the same time giving him a forearm to the face that caused the Aduri to cry out, putting him on wobbly legs. At the same moment, the door burst open and the others rushed into the room upon hearing the noise. Everyone froze, the only sound in the room was that of the blood dripping into the carpet from the Aduri’s broken nose, which he was trying futilely to lessen the flow of. Ulrich rushed over, removing the Aduri’s hand from the gun, allowing Akko to step back while he stayed close.

“I’ll pass on the offer,” he said, “Now if you look to your right, you’ll see the exit I want you to be moving through.”

The Aduri turned and walked out of the room, past Zephyr and Pietro standing by the door, Akko and Ulrich behind them, as the four watched the Aduri head down the hallway. After the parting look, they began to mill back into the room.

“Guys,” Pietro called from the doorway, still looking down the hallway

The others went back to the door and looked down at what now seemed to be a standoff. The two Aduri stood perhaps a dozen feet from another duo, both of whom were brimming with an electric current up and down their arms, while the Aduri male held his hand on his pistol and the redhead seemed ready to strike as well, embers flowing through her hair as flames danced around her.

“HEY!” Pietro called out, stepping into the hallway, the would-be combatants turned, “take your Org Wars somewhere else.”

“Lightning Falcons,” Zephyr whispers to Akko, who nods

Someone comes around the corner near the Lightning Falcons and looks at them, then at the Aduri down the hall. Without a word, the man cocked his head and walked away; the other two Falcons begrudgingly followed. The Aduri relaxed, looking back once more at Akko and the others before departing into the opposite direction.

The night lights of Alter City shone around them as the brothers cruised through the downtown, days after the Syndicate situation. Buildings towered above them, and above those, the airships patrolled the skies, shining light down into the darkened city below.

“That car’s been following us since we left the stadium,” Ulrich stated, looking into his rear view

“Any idea who it could be,” Akko asked, turning slightly to look behind

“I’ve got one guess,”

Akko knew what he meant, the Aduri. “There’s a bar up ahead, let me off there.”

Ulrich pulled up beside the establishment, “I’ll swing around.”

Akko got out of the car and walked into the bar. The jukebox played in the corner, carrying out a tune that matched well to the laughter and noise coming from the patrons in the bar. He looked around, taking in the room. Much of the noise came from a group of men and women seated in a corner of the bar; someone seems to have made a joke, one that had everyone else in the area laughing in overly done fashion. Nearby a trio of construction workers were noticeably annoyed, but aside from glares in their direction, continued conversing among themselves, adding their voices to the buzz of conversation that filled the air. The barman nodded to Akko as he took a seat at the counter.

“What’ll it be sir?”

From his peripheral, Akko saw three men in overcoats walk in, and go separate ways. One of which, was towards the Akko.

“Gimme a bottle of your cheapest liquor,” Akko replied

The barman raised an eyebrow, “If I’m correct on who you are, a guy like you isn’t for want of notes.”

Akko said nothing as the Syndicate member took a seat beside him. The barman placed the bottle in front of Akko, and upon receiving a look from the Aduri, took the cue and walked to the other end of the bar, busying himself with cleaning a glass.

“Have you had a change of heart?” the Aduri asked, continuing to face forward

Akko smirked, bringing the bottle to his lips and taking a sip. It tasted as cheap as the price, “Within the last twenty-four hours? No.”

“You’re not making this easy.”

“On the contrary,” Akko quipped, “I’ve given my answer twice now.”

The Aduri turned to face Akko, “There are three guns on you,” he said, “it’d be in your best interest to come with us.”

Akko had already noticed when he’d moved his hand to the imprint in the overcoat that resembled a revolver. As he turned to the Aduri, he man’s eyes seemed to glaze over. The sound of smashing glass took Akko’s attention as he turned to the origin of the noise, though already sure of its cause. He turned in time to see Ulrich, now in the building, smash one of the Syndicate member’s face into the table, before spinning around and kicking another table, sending it flying at the next Aduri who was getting up from his seat, hitting him square in the face. The last Aduri had no time to react before the bottle struck the side of his head. He fell from the stool, joining his comrades, unconscious on the floor.

“Easy enough,” Ulrich remarked, stepping over the mess he’d made

The jukebox’s tune now seemed out of place as all eyes now looked upon the two brothers, a hushed silence had come over the room. No one moved; the sudden outbreak of action made for a tense atmosphere. Broken only by a single successive, slow, drawn out clap. The brothers turned to the lone clapper, and seated in the center of the large group in the corner, sat a sleek haired, well dressed gentleman around Akko’s age, one side of his mouth curled into a half smile as he looked upon the two men, his eyes held a sort of fine pompousness about them.

“Let’s get out of here,” Akko said, removing notes from his wallet and placing them on the counter

Ulrich nodded and followed his brother out of the bar. As noise returned to the room, the barman looked down at the money Akko had left for damage. He beamed, it was more than enough.

part one: http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1eksnv/unnatural_alchemy_part_1_a_story_i_am_working_on/ 

The Qulathar imperium held the freehold on an impressive mansion near the government district of Freeport. With sweeping views of the harbour and great lighthouse that guarded the entrance to the same. A small piece of sovereign soil in a foreign land. 

Within the greatroom where windows three times the height of a man stretching to the celling looked out onto the last of the fireworks exploding red against the black and starry sky. The pale moonlight and the flickering of the small fire in the great stone hearth caught the gold leaf scattered around the rich decorations and made the ambassador's wine appear indigo. 'My first real opportunity to talk and they expect me to barter like a common merchant. Do they know how they insult me Rossart?'

Rossart placed his untouched wine on a side table and shuffled on his feet. 'My lord, the men of Freeport think as merchants, they see war as an opportunity to trade' Rossart had been expecting a quiet evening while the new years celebrations rubbed off on the mood of his superior. Disappointingly Lord Derwent had been back before midnight full of a furious desire to speak at length under the assumption that this counted as discussion. 

The old ambassador, had never missed a new years day play in his nine years at the post and would joyously partake in the merriment. Returning home only at dawns light, laughing and joking as he stumbled about with spilled wine down his fat belly. Larger than life and eager to partake in all the delights the city of Freeport had to offer. His replacement, slim and youthful but intense and serious like a crow in his black robes of state was in every respect his opposite. 
'is it too much to ask that anyone take my side?' spat Lord Derwent, glowering up at the worried goatee of his servant from his seat.
 
'my lord, my duty is to the empire and the emperor above all. As cultural attaché It is my duty to speak as to the mindset of the city so that you may reason out their motives without having to speak your private thoughts to them' Rossart stuttered, and before he could stop himself 'your predecessor found this arrangement most useful'.

Turning away from the fire to glower directly into Rossarts face the ambassador icily replied 'did he?, the Traitor' the last word hanging in the air. 

'my lord, I found Lord Vespis to be most loyal. He had no knowledge of his cousins actions, that his whole line must be dishonoured as the price for treason is regrettably necessary to prevent such acts in future. On this the law is quite clear'. 

The ambassador snorted and turned back to watch the fire. 'tell me Rossart, how would he of responded to such an offer?'.

'I. I don’t rightly know my lord, such an deal has never been proposed in the past'. 

Steepling his fingers the ambassador pensively asked 'then what has changed?'.

 'My lord, it is possible they speak the truth. They might have only recently discovered the source of the stone and wish to confirm'. 

'I don't believe that, these men are without honour'.

'They have an honour of sorts my lord, they will abide by the words of a contract to the letter once it has been agreed'. 

The ambassador hummed in thought, 'But then what do they want with it?. The stone I mean, you cannot build with it, eat it nor smelt it. It is not magic, dense or any other property that could be put to use. Unless they wish to distract us while the rebellion rages'. 

'My lord, while they will abide by a contract once it is signed, in negotiating the terms of a contract the Freeport seek any means to an advantage. I strongly suspect that they already know of a use, or have convinced others of a use and seek to confirm what they already know before striking further bargains'.  The ambassador fell silent, Rossart nervously stepped back. 

On Arriving at the docks a fortnight ago, when the new ambassador had fallen into a rage at being met by a 'serving wench' unbefitting an envoy of his imperial majesty. Rossarts desperate pleading that yes this was indeed the Doge's minister of foreign affairs, and yes it is not unusual for women in Freeport to hold positions of rank and title, had set the tone for their working relationship. With the suffering attaché trying to retain deference while his superior ranted against the barbarism, insanity, greed, spinelessness and altogether unchivalrous nature of things in this accused/dammed/stinking city. Rossart for what seemed like an eternity waited the latest aristocratic tantrum. When instead the ambassador spoke 'very well' Rossart nearly tripped over his own feet. 

'My lord?' 

'Let them have their little expedition, then they can buy on our own terms, that I shall dictate, then they shall see what happens when one approaches a lord of the Qulathar empire like a common market trader'. 

The new year in Freeport was off to a slow start. The night winds had blown a way the smoky miasma of the previous nights bonfires and fireworks. To be replaced by the slothful effect of a thousand thousand hangovers that pulsed in the morning sun. With a brown cloak covering his blue robes with yellow trimming, that marked one as one of the political class of Freeport, senator Boatman scurried though the near deserted streets. Passing through a side entrance unseen, Boatman came face to face with Rossart. 'I trust the ambassador has had a good new years, I have matters to discuss'. 

'Indeed he does senator, I am to take you to him directly'. In the same stateroom that had been host to last nights deliberations, now alive with the dawn light pouring in from over the eastern sea. Lord Derwent was resplendent in the silver and black garb, standing in front of the fireplace above which the freshly painted coat of arms of house Derwent now stood proud below that of the emperors.
'I thank you for the invitation, are we to deliberate or perhaps some breakfast before hand?' 

'there will be no deliberations, senator. I have summoned you to deliver my terms'. Senator Boatman was a natural politician and gave no indication that he had even noticed the emphasis on the word summoned. His poker face was the open friendly smile that all salesmen in all worlds aspire to. Lord Derwent waited a few seconds for the impression of total power to kick in, when the senator gave no indication of being intimidated he proceeded regardless with the smug aura of a man who will soon get his way. 'It would appear that there is little downside to the empire, but perhaps there is little hope  of speedy gains. A party of six will suffice, with one caveat. They cannot be from Freeport. As you say yourself you are a neutral party, questions would arise if you were to see seafaring folk so far inland. You will have to arrange for, private contractors as you call them'.

Arms folded the ambassador smirkingly looked on as senator Boatman looked up lips moving in silent mental calculation. 'I believe that the terms are acceptable, I shall inform the interested parties. Thank you and good day'. 

After the senator had departed, Derwent turned to Rossart 'even if the interested parties are less interested I believe it cannot hurt to be owed a favour by such a man.' 

'no, my lord'. 

In the college of alchemists, located in the north-western unfashionable part of the city  senator Boatman shared a modest lunch of bread an cheese with Malchick in her office. It had taken the best part of the morning to cross the city, a common complaint for those who preferred to avoid the bazaars, soaks and crowded docks with their winding and dark alleys. Boatman had no need to mind, he had nothing more important today. No one would question someone visiting an old friend on new years. 'have you made the necessary arrangements?' Queryed Malchick brushing crumbs from her chest around the pendant that signified the highest qualification in alchemy.

'Yes' replied Boatman swallowing a lump of bread while looking around the shelves of rare herbs, coloured jars and books. 

'so we have room for the party of four?' Malchick removed the empty plates from her large oak desk.

'Six provided that they are not local' grinned Boatman, 'tell me is the ore worth all this trouble?' Grinning like a tiger Malchick removed a blue tinted brick of metal the size of a persons thumb from a draw and placed it on the desk. Picking up a large gleaming steel meat cleaver from a basket of herbs she held it aloft theatrically before bringing it down with all her weight onto the small mass of metal. The metal was scarcely scratched in stark contrast to the blunt and cracked cleaver. The pair grinned at each other.

CHAPTER ONE – The Librarian

Ariya had no idea that she was a witch. She didn’t care much for the world beyond the library, in fact. Here, in the library where she had worked for the last four years of her life, was all she knew. She picked up several tomes from a table that those that visited the library often left lying about. They were old, worn, and neglected.

She read the names of the tomes so as to get an idea of where the tomes belonged in the library. She remembered reading several of the tomes, all seeming to be old legends, and myths about the world. One in particular caught her eye. It was named, “The Tale of Yeril, and Beril.” She had never read that one before.

She took the tomes, placing them in the correct places, save for the last one. She was going to give this a reading. After placing the last book, she walked outside of the library into the courtyard. The wind swept down from the mountains, adding that particular chill to the air that was oft felt on days such as these. She sat quietly, perched on the stone bricks that encircled a small flower garden. As she opened the book to read it, she noticed that most of the pages were torn out. She sighed, closed it, and stood up. This book would have to be reported as damaged.

She entered the library. The hall was lined with many tall windows that allowed the outside light to spill through, and illuminate. This was a hall she had traveled many times, though today she seemed to be rather absent-minded as she walked down the hall, clutching her book in her arms. This woman was young, only twenty. She was a slender youth, with straight brown hair and piercing blue eyes. Mostly quiet, and reserved, she kept to herself.

She grew up under the care of her father, a man old enough to take care of her, and who had the means to provide a more fortunate life for Ariya. Most of the war orphans grew up in poverty, destitute, and wretched. He had fled from the eastern kingdom from those times of conflict with his daughter, and made his way to the kingdom of Sanria, where they both resided. There were many children like her these days, orphans of a war that took place two decades ago. Then, she was no more than a babe, more prone to fits, and crying out for the attention that one requires while that young, a stark contrast to her now quiet demeanor.

Her father would later ride off to assist in the war effort, and he died fighting against the Eastern Kingdom, which had been taken over by some lunatics as he described them. It was said that he died fighting valiantly, that he had slain many of the enemy before they overwhelmed him, and snuffed his life out. This left Ariya to fend for herself by the time she was thirteen years of age. She, however, was always proud of her father for protecting everybody from what was said were a wicked people that were attempting to oppress the peoples of Sanria.

She had learned many things about the Eastern kingdom growing up. Her father, and others told her about the wicked witch that had usurped power, and ruled there with an iron fist. She, like other children that grew up in her kingdom, were taught to dislike those from the Eastern kingdom, as wicked fools that carried out orders at the behest of their heartless ruler. This is why she, and many children, and others like her grew up detesting witches, and anything to do with them. It always seemed a fantastic tale. Witches were only myths. Ariya detested the idea of it since she loved her father, and he had been taken from her by a kingdom that supposedly served a witch.

It was probably the worst time in her life. She remembered when her father left. She begged him not to go. She cried. He reassured her that this was something that he had to do, and he left. She was miserable for a few days, but she returned to being the cheerful, playful girl she was. Days passed. A week went by. Time continued to meld one day to the next, and the weeks passed. She waited.

Other men came back, lovers, husbands, fathers. Her father didn’t come back. A year passed. She played games with other children to pass the time. A popular game to play was “knights and witches.” Nobody ever wanted to be the witch. Witches were terrible, ugly people, and knights were noble, just people. Ariya played the game. Being a little girl, she was usually the witch. The other boys “killed” her for being the witch with their sticks, and brought her to justice.

Two years passed. Her father didn’t come back. The boys weren’t interested in playing those children’s games anymore. She noticed they looked at her differently. She didn’t like the way they looked at her. She became reclusive, and took to reading in the royal library.

Three years passed. She was sixteen. She had spent so much time in the library that she didn’t have friends anymore. The headmaster of the library had taken notice of how much time she spent there. She began to work there as one of the librarians sorting through the books, parchments, and scrolls that were collected there.
Word came back one day. She still remembered standing there in the library. A royal messenger walked up to her, and handed her a letter. It said her father was dead. She didn’t know what to do. She’d waited three years to hear from him. She stood there completely silent, holding the letter in her hand. Reality washed over her. She left the library, and went home. She was angry, hurt, confused.

Nobody saw her for a month. The headmaster visited her house to check on her. She told him. He was a kind, and understanding man. He’d seen this happen all too often. He knew she was another war orphan. He told her that when she was ready to return to the library, she was still welcome there.

Ariya grew up in Aques, the capital city of kingdom of Sanria, a lush, vibrant country. Looking out one of the tall windows Ariya saw the mountain to the west. There was also a river that flowed down from the mountain along the northern edge of the city. She remembered Aques was called the city of life since ancient times when it was first founded.

Ariya was quite fond of reading such material, such a book held in her arms as she made her way back toward the library. Old legends, myths, and histories were among her favorite things to read. Fantasy she thought, was better than life, and so often was she found reading some book, or scroll that had some fantastic tale in it that she at times forgot about the real world.

So it was the same today when she was not paying attention, and lost in her own thoughts that she bumped into a man walking that very same hallway mere steps from the inner library. She was sent sprawling to the floor, and she lost the grip on her book, and it landed on the floor with a rather loud thud. Ariya looked up, and snapped out of her daze. Standing before her was a rather tall man. He was obviously from the military as his dress was of such a nature of those that served in the military of Sanria.

“Hey, watch where you are going!” he said.

“I am so sorry,” she said. Ariya apologized to the man as she stood to her feet, and picked up the book. “I did not see you there.”

The man shrugged his shoulders, then turned, and entered the library door. Ariya looked about a bit confused for a moment, then lowered her head, and let out a sigh. She was not even clear-headed enough to pay attention to her surroundings, she thought. How idiotic. She had obviously made a complete fool out of herself, and he was sort of cute.

She looked up, turned, and walked into the inner library. She could not see the man she had just bumped into, he had probably made his way to some unseen section. It was always her luck, bumping into some strange good-looking guy, and making a complete fool out of herself without much to say about the situation. She would usually be called some disparaging term.

Rows, and rows of books lined rich, decorated bookshelves cut out of wood. Many of the volumes were thick, and heavy. Mostly though, they were not single books, but rather collections of works, bound into thick volumes. The works were placed in the volumes according to relevance. Relevance was key here, because most of the books, and other materials in this place were boring, and did not have the sort of things that Ariya preferred to read about in them.

She made her way over to the section that the book she had borrowed came from, and placed it back on the shelf. Nobody actually took books away from this library, because that was not actual policy. Instead, one had to come here, and read the books in the library, or out in the courtyard or the general premises to be able to make use of it. Most of the copies were unique, and the library did not have replacements for the volumes within. 

It was getting late, though, and time for Ariya to head home, as night time would be setting in soon.
She strolled through the city as she made her way home. Springtime was here, and that meant the Festival of Roses. A little girl ran up to Ariya, cheer in her expression.

“A rose for your loved ones!” she said.

She held out several roses. Ariya gave a silver coin to the girl, and bought a rose. She smiled at the girl. “Thank you,” she said.

Once inside of her house, Ariya made her way into her father’s room. It was tidy, untouched. She took in the scent of the rose before laying it at the foot of his bed. It was quiet.

Ariya made her way back to the commons room, she lit candles, the soft warm glow illuminating the room as the sun set behind the mountain casting the city in darkness. She sat down in her chair in melancholy. It was lonely.
She removed a pendant hung about her neck. It was the last memento of her father. Inside of a solid gold crescent moon lay a blue orb, clenched within the moon. It was a gift from her father to her. Now it was all she had left of him. The gold chain she allowed to slip through her fingers as she held it.

The night wore on, and she felt tired. Changing out of the dress she wore, she made her bed ready, and crawled into it. The cold feel of the sheets against her skin was relaxing.

She dreamed. She was on the top of a rocky hill with some other woman. Her lips moved as though talking. Ariya didn’t fully understand what she was saying. The woman attacked her. There was a fantastic battle. Her dream changed.

She was on her back, looking up. There was that same woman. She spoke.

I have been lurking in this subreddit for a few weeks now and continue to be impressed by this community and the work you are producing! I have long been a fan of Fantasy Fiction. One idea I have been toying around with for a few years is the possibility of becoming an Audiobook Narrator. I had never listened to an audiobook until maybe 5 years ago when I met a friend in college who was blind. I always thought the idea of listening to an audiobook was very foreign and taboo, but she got me hooked on the Wheel of Time series that is largely narrated by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading. I found that there were plenty of times I could enjoy listening to an audiobook where a real book just didn’t make sense. (Mainly on the 5 hour one way trip to my parents house in Minnesota). In order to actually become an audiobook narrator I figure I need some practice. That is where I believe that in this subreddit I have stumbled upon something grand. I have seen a few of you ask for critiques and advice. I would like to offer my service as someone with a slightly different view than a writer. A person that thinks a bit more on the audible side. I have many ideas, but I would like to possibly start a few fellowships with writers and perhaps read aloud some of your works as practice for a fledgling narrator. Would anyone be interested in something like this? If anyone wants to know more about me or has any questions feel free to message me. I am not looking to make any money off of this yet... maybe one day though. But for the time being I am just looking for anyone who might be interested.

Thank you for your time in reading this proposition. I apologize if this has been asked before, and I hope that as a non-writer this post is not against any subreddit rules.

Chapter 1: The Bloodhouse. 
Vyola had never been to a fighting ring before. She was good in a scrap – she knew she was, as her lack of broken bones and intact facial features told even after reaching 15 years of age in a dirty, rough town alone. Taking part in a fight had its own unique satisfaction, a kind of grim human pleasure. But she’d never enjoyed watching one. The bitter disgust that came with viewing violence was far too strong in her. Still, she found her feet padding onward to the Bloodhouse, Dreer’s one and only arena where murder was permitted – a true gladiator ring. 

The winding, damp streets of Dreer were like a labyrinth, moss oozing under Vyola’s bare toes as she walked. The smells of sea salt, mould and sweat saturated every surface and made up the air that Vyola drew in. This clinging scent grew stronger as she stepped lightly toward the city centre. She was entirely detached; once a youth pushed her to the side pointlessly. She slapped wetly into the straw side of a building and dirtied her hands, cursing, but pressed on grimly, ignoring the laughs behind her. She at one point stepped directly onto a shard of something cold; it gave her a neat-looking puncture wound that felt fundamentally wrong, as invasive lacerations will. She rested for a short while. The only place to sit was the floor, damp under Vyola’s backside. It made her grimace, but at least it was a rest. While she sat, men and women of all ages pulled carts toward the market, loaded with grimy goods and wet cloth. 

Thieves were everywhere. Vyola liked to play a little game; she’d dart her sharp eyes through the sparse life around, and spot as many wandering hands and pinching fingers as she could. A grin would appear when she saw someone pull off a lift. She would never dare to report anyone, though. The city’s guards were likely to be bribed anyway and consequently beat her for snitching, or simply not care. The few honest ones would not be able to stop the thieving, and it would only land Vyola with a reputation she did not much relish. She had also found that the thief, ironically, is his own best target; those euphoric from their successful heist are often the least wary of having the catch plucked.

And besides, she’d be guilty of hypocrisy should she take the moral high ground when it came to the matter of stealing. She’d snagged more than a few trinkets and crumbs from merchants in her day. Dreer was not the easiest place to survive with honour intact. There wasn’t much else worth being good at anyway. Not much else that helped you put food down your neck. 

Brushing her simple tan tunic and trousers off as she stood and began to walk again, Vyola had herself a good think. She was curious at her journey. Whenever she tried to turn her footsteps, she found herself inexorably drawn back into a route that would lead her to the aptly named arena. If she took a deliberate wrong turn, her feet would correct themselves instantly, as though they were bound with a spell. When she attempted to stop altogether, she felt ill at ease. This odd sense of danger built inside her like the roaring tides of the Oyerën sea, and gradually evolved to panic, sending her pulse thumping and her mind buzzing. She ran then. 

She found herself at the gate to the ring at exactly midday. The sun was at its highest point. A scarce few of its brass rays penetrated the perpetual gloomy clouds that hung over the place. She noted the shift under her feet, now pale and mildly sodden, from the tamped dark earth and sawdust flooring of Dreer’s streets, to the cold, wet stone of the Bloodhouse’s entrance. 

The gatekeeper was a weedy, pinch-faced man named Slink. Vyola knew him by sight and had loathed him since she first set eyes on him. He had his filthy fingers in a good many pies, none of which were honest. He coaxed Vyola’s last two copper counters from her and allowed her to enter. She cursed him under her breath once she was inside. That money had not come into her pocket easily. 

Vyola pushed and prodded aside several men and one woman, better to see the events unfolding in the ring. As she approached the open, circular arena with the silver railings around, an enormous gladiator wearing a motley collection of armour smashed in the head of his opponent with a terrible crack. Vyola did not flinch, but a small curl of distaste found its way onto her lips. She did not overly sympathize with the dead man, but the juggernaut in the ring made her skin crawl with his hooded eyes and apish movement. 

To her he looked like an immense, solidified loaf, fat and muscle layered all the way to his tree-trunk neck. An energetic youth standing beside her hollered what she assumed was the victor’s name. He looked to be a man in his element, and so Vyola asked him when the great King’s tournament began. He gawped at her as though she were a dribbling moron, and told her that she was watching it. Vyola moved away from him after that, as he had begun to look at her as though she were a piece of food. 

The King’s tournament was held once every three years; men and women from all over the assembled provinces of Mornefall would compete, fools dying in droves because they believed they were worthy of a place in the Royal Guard. The group’s title was rather a misnomer; though they often accompanied the royalty as bodyguards, the Guard did far more than simply protect. They assassinated, bribed, blackmailed, and fought for the interests of various leaves on that venerated tree of royals. Most were great warriors, and scholars too, their minds whirring with new theories and inventions.

It was rare that one would actually be chosen for this tight ring of handymen, however. It was a coveted honour, and the process of selection was known for its brutality. Only the truly extraordinary were 
elevated and trained in such a way. 

Vyola wondered whether the man now dominating the ring would be taken by the King’s men to be tested should no-one defeat him today. She imagined that he’d be escorted in to the true centre of Mornefall, the immense capital city known as Sundowne. The place seemed to hold an unshakable place in legend. Built by the first settlers, and Long-Morne himself, from which the nation took its name. It was often called the Pale City, on account of the immense numbers of ivory and marble statues that lined its walkways and rafters. It sounded like a nice place to visit, but then again, she wouldn’t be seeing it any time soon. The beastly man in the ring startled her out of her thoughts as he gave a primal yowl of victory.  

Slink had given up extracting a toll from people. Instead they streamed in, chattering huddles of men and women clothed in layers of wool or leather, many wearing three or four-cornered hide hats, with wide brims designed to keep the near-constant rain out of the eyes. Vyola was pushed to a space the very edge of the arena, and her hands, pallid from cold, latched onto the railing grimly. Her knuckles stood out of her slender hands. 

Silence fell all around the Bloodhouse as Slink wormed his way under the railing and half-ran to the giant in the centre. He raised his voice to a high-pitched screech, and claimed that this man, Hak being his name, was a champion appointed by the King, and had been unbeaten in this ring for the past three years, though he had never been picked for the Royal Guard. As he spoke, a few obviously underfed attendants ran into the middle of the arena and cleared away the squelching mess that had been the last contender’s body. Slink, with his dirty rat face and tattered red cloak, then asked in a lower, throatier voice, if any brave warrior dared to face him and prove him a fraud.

The roar Vyola expected did not come. No man stepped forward. It seemed the crowd of assorted peasants, farmers from outer Dreer, traders, pickpockets, and ranks of beggars were all holding one breath, a breath that when exhaled would bring death. The excitement – or fear of the people was tangible. It was almost noisy, ringing silently in the ears. Seconds slid by. Vyola felt every beat of her heart. The sea seemed to swell in her mind and an irregular drumbeat boomed behind her eyes. 

Hak twisted slowly on the spot, a smug expression caressing his features. He looked to Vyola as though he’d been torn from his mother by the teeth and then dashed against the wall a good few times. His face truly was a battleground, scars, pockmarks, and some sort of rash rendering him horrifying. The toughened leather plates over his legs and arms did little to hide his misshapen, lumpy, muscled form. Some religions of Iwara, Mornefall’s easternmost province, regarded outward ugliness as a reflection of sickness inside. If this were true, the hulking man in the ring was rotten to his core. 

Slink began to list, slowly and cruelly, the rewards given to victors who stepped forward to serve the crown. Food, shelter, education were all offered by the generous royalty. A future beckoned, claimed the oily man. Silence hung in the air like a malevolent spirit, compelling every spectator to listen with all their might for the one to break it. 

Something rose up in Vyola like bile; a stream of confused emotions, all foreign to her. She felt alive, polished and fresh. The air ceased to smell of rain and dirt. Instead, she could feel forests, and caves, mountains and the undiscovered places of Mornefall in every shallow breath she took. In her heart, she found a longing for glory, for learning. She wanted to visit grand cities, to dance and sing and lead expeditions into wild terrain. She needed to leave Dreer. Its claustrophobic gated streets, walled by the looming wooden walls, were a cage. She hated it then, hated it all, the wet and the mud and the monotony of every day spent in the same awful city. 
She came back to herself and said, before she knew what she had done, “I’ll fight.”

The inhabitants of the other world were our beasts and beings of legend—elves, jinn, vampires, garuda, etc. etc. They were able to travel between worlds using the gates whenever they wanted, until one day when every gate suddenly closed at the same time. Any of the creatures who happened to be Earthside when the gates closed were now stranded here forever, essentially refugees who had to adapt to their new home.

Think *Stargate* with some China Miéville and Jim Butcher thrown in for inspiration, maybe.

The story is set on modern day Earth, but there are two key differences, neither of which the average human is aware of:

1) There is a sizeable population of supernatural critters (many of them quite inhuman) lurking under their very noses.

2) Magic exists, although in a gritty way—not a wand-and-spellbook sort of thing. Aside from the fact that it allows you to do things from a distance, it otherwise operates according the laws of physics (e.g. no energy can be created or destroyed, only converted). And it's more like a tool than anything. For example, unless you have an advanced degree in neurobiology, trying to magically brainwash someone would end very poorly. Think ""performing brain surgery with a three-foot-long rusty scalpel while drunk and blindfolded"".

Herein lies my problem: **On a modern-day Earth where magic must operate (more or less) according to the laws of physics, would it be possible to maintain the [""Masquerade""](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade) that hides the supernatural world from everyday people?**

The more I think about it, I can't see how it would be possible. Spy satellites, YouTube, the constant ability to take photos and record video with your phone, sites like Reddit that allow people the world over to share any sort of strangeness that they encounter … Even the most carefully hidden society would slip up eventually. **Can anyone think of any good justifications or realistic ways for the supernatural to remain hidden?**

And part two of the question: **What are some reasons that the supernatural community would even *want* to stay hidden?** The obvious one would be that humans outnumber them and have guns. But a leprechaun could use an AK-47 just as well as a person, and then fry their asses with a fireball for good measure. And humans are constantly trying to dominate one another, so why shouldn't an army of power-hungry leyaks expose themselves, declare war on humanity, and start rounding up pregnant women so they can eat their fetuses?

Even if (by some miracle) the supernatural world was able to escape the gaze of spy satellites and the nasties were forced to keep the peace and not reveal themselves, there would still be the occasional political zealot with nothing to lose. All it would take is a single YouTube video of a group of Japanese tourists being eaten, or a journalist suddenly growing bat wings during the State of the Union address. Then the jig is up.

More sword and sorcery than anything. While there are wide-reaching consequences in the plots, the importance of the impact is more on a personal level than a worldwide scale. As a vague example: the integrity of an entire realm is challenged, but the characters care not so much because the realm and its occupants are under assault but because *they are*. (I write about . . . villains, for the sake of simplicity.) So it's not an epic fantasy tale.

Then there's the pervasiveness of romance. I do have some erotic scenes in one book, and hints at some in the other. Basically, it's fantasy romance leaning more toward fantasy. 

I've tried pitching them toward the general fantasy crowd with very little traction. They're not romance enough to tackle that market. I've found readers of Jim Butcher's works tend to enjoy them (whether that's coincidental or not is beyond me).

Maybe there's some huge potential market I'm missing, or maybe the market just isn't that large. I don't know.

Thoran concentrated. The message the elders wanted transmitted to Cradon clan had been received. Thoran knew this as surely as he knew he had eaten Hella’s eggs for breakfast that morning. Cradon clan was three days journey to the east. Had the two clans not had communicators, someone would have had to have made that journey, for neither clan had a transporter. 

Cradon’s communicator relayed back that her own elders would need some time to consider this request. They had asked for two days, to be sure their own clan was safe. Thoran conveyed this to the elders. They had no choice, of course, and accepted the two day waiting period which, including travel time, would be five days. The elders told Thoran they would return Thursday at noon and that he should be waiting for them.

Thoran would be there. The 16-year-old, who was already one of the clan’s most powerful magians, had no desire to leave his home, not after what happened to his best friend. Thoran had seen death before, but never so terrifyingly. Death came to old people, or the infirm. His grandparents had died when Thoran was ten. He remembered it clearly. First Nana and three days later, Papi. They went quietly. Death was not supposed to come to 16-year-old girls. Teenagers were supposed to live forever. 

Thoran was the one who first noticed the rash on Cleanna’s arm. They had been out hunting with Cleanna’s father and uncle. Cleanna didn’t seem too worried and neither did anyone else in those first few days. But then, the rash began to spread. After three days, it had reddened her entire arm and became painful. After seven days, her entire body was covered in red, pus-filled splotches and the pain became unbearable.

Cleanna screamed at the slightest movement. Thoran was convinced it was the pain itself, and not the rash or any underlying sickness that had killed her. Cleanna’s older sister was a minor plant magian. She had covered her sister in a paste she concocted that she had hoped might ease the pain, if not lessen the rash itself. It did not. 

The wailing continued for two straight days. Thoran, along with Cleanna’s parents, remained by her side until the end. Other family members and friends had come by. They stayed for an hour or two, but could not stand seeing her in such pain, could not stand the screaming, and so they made their excuses and left. Thoran couldn’t leave. He wouldn’t leave. He pushed thoughts at her, the way he pushed thoughts at communicators from nearby villages. He tried pulling responses from her, so she wouldn’t have to speak. 

At first, there was nothing. He knew she was receiving his thoughts, hearing them, because she acknowledged them with blinks of her eyes, but even those blinks caused pain. Soon, though, he was able to pull thoughts from her. Was she pushing them out, the way a magian could, or was he reaching inside of her. Thoran didn’t know, but he felt a connection open between them. He knew that she knew the end was near. She told him that she loved him. She wanted him to tell her parents that she loved them and that she hoped she had been a good daughter to them.

Thoran didn’t want to hear anymore. He told her that she would not die, that he would make sure of it. Of course, he had no way of making sure of anything. On the outside she screamed in pain, but on the inside he could feel the peace. Her final message to him was a simple goodbye. He didn’t need to look at her to know she was gone, he felt the connection between them break, as if they had been holding hands, and her hand slipped out of his. He tried to reach for her, to pull her back, but it was no use. 

During that week, Thoran hadn’t noticed that others were becoming afflicted as well. The schoolteacher was the first, then two children from a family new to the village. In all, twenty-four people had become covered in the agonizing, pus-filled sores and the pained wailing sounds of children and adults could be heard throughout the village. 

The elders came to Thoran the day following Cleanna’s passing. Despite his grief, they told him he needed to call in a healer from one of the nearby clans. He had tried Dinlor, Nacada, Cradon and Bytomac. Dinlor had no healer. Bytomac and Nacada were dealing with their own similar outbreaks. Cradon had two healers and so far had seen no sign of any rash. They asked for time to be sure the sickness would not come to them and if it did not, they would then send one over.

The elders returned on Thursday, as they said they would, but two were missing. Thoran guessed at the reason.

“Them, too?” he asked.

“Freen became sick, yes,” said Quan. “Rheon’s sister was afflicted and he wanted to remain with her. Have you received a response yet?”    

“No,” said Thoran. He closed his eyes and concentrated on Cradon’s communicator. A stronger magian would be able to simply push her thoughts to Thoran, but Cradon’s communicator was a minor magian. He needed to grab hold of her thoughts as she pushed them away from her, and pull them into himself. The message was there. 

“She says one of their elders has become sick with what they believe is the same rash, so they will not be able to send help,” said Thoran.

“Beg her,” said Quan. “Ask for one of their healers. We are willing to give gold, as much as they want. Tell her.” 

Thoran told her. Along with the message, he pushed as much hopefulness, as much positive feeling as he could. He had learned early on that the way in which the message was conveyed was as important — sometimes more important — than the words themselves. 

He felt the sadness of her response, before he received the words. If it had been the Cradon communicator herself making the decision, he felt certain she would have acquiesced, but of course it was her elders who were deciding. They had heard the stories about this sickness from Thoran’s village and from the others. They knew they would need as much healing power as the universe could provide and that their healers could harness. They would not be sending help. A single tear came to Thoran’s eye. He said nothing. ",,False,,t5_2t4ad,1361730910.0,,,True,t3_194zhq,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/194zhq/developing_a_world_and_magic_system_and_decided/,

The gray dawn gave way to morning, informing him that it had been nearly half a day since he’d escaped. Heavy hoofbeats echoed off the trees around him. His pursuers were gaining, and it wouldn’t be long before he would be found and executed for desertion.

 

Snow danced by him as he ran—its cool embrace was a welcome relief on his weary body, but it betrayed his footsteps in the fresh snowfall. His escape was slowed by a set of banded armor and a standard issue sword—required armaments of all men in the Roman legions. They gave him comfort that he may be able to defend himself when it came to that.

 

Morning light cast halos on the needles of the fir trees and illuminated the steam that poured from his mouth with each labored breath. He could feel his legs beginning to buckle, his muscles having reached their limit. His shoulders cried at the weight they were forced to bear, but he could not slow, not when freedom was so close.

 

The thunderous beat of hooves against the earth shook him in the teeth, motivating him to continue. He didn’t know where he was headed, all that mattered was to continue to press each foot deeply into the snow, one in front of the other. He had dreamed of escape and slipped out quietly during the night while many of the men were having dreams of their own.

 

When he was young he would dream of where to hunt, when livestock would become ill, if they would reap a good harvest, and he was well respected as an oracle in his village. But then his dreams filled with soldiers, and the soldiers came—they came in hundreds. The frightened villagers blamed him for summoning them. Out of fear, or anger, he was cast out and sold to the Romans as a slave.

 

Trading slavery for a lifetime of service in the Roman legions was a decision he came to detest. His legion was held responsible losing a host of supplies when they retreated from a barbarian sneak attack, and were punished through decimation.

 

Decimation required his legion be divided into smaller groups of ten men where each group of soldiers was commanded to draw straws amongst themselves.

 

He watched, disgusted, as the selected man in each group was fallen upon before they could defend themselves. Savagely, he watched as they were bludgeoned to death by their brothers in arms. It went like that through the ranks until a tenth of the legion had destroyed itself. He had seen enough killing, and he would be free from it.

 

He staggered and braced himself against a tree and slumped exhausted beside it. His chest rose and fell rapidly, and his face was slick with sweat that steamed in the frozen air. He tried to rise, but his body refused—it could go no further—and he fell to the snow. He sat with his back flat against the wet bark of the tree, too tired to continue.

 

The sound of horses and men increased; their black forms appeared hazy in the distance, but began to take shape as they grew closer. The tired soldier was finished. The penalty for deserters was most effective if done publicly, and they would no doubt drag him back to camp for his execution. He waited for them calmly, accepting that his body, and his life, had reached their limit.

 

His eyelids fluttered and his shoulders slumped. He closed his eyes and he let himself dream—just one last time, and a soft voice whispered into his ear.

 

“Stay with us.”

 

The tired soldier was jolted awake. The voice was so clear to him, and sounded so near, but besides the horses fast approaching in the distance he was alone. He unsheathed his sword. The blade hissed as it exited its leather scabbard and he stabbed it into the earth, using it as a crutch to stabilize him as he rose. Slowly, with sword in hand, he stumbled weakly the other side of the tree, but he was alone. The origin of the voice remained a mystery, and his gaze quickly turned to the intangible forms in the distance—they would be on him in moments.

 

His footing waned and he stumbled again, crashing into the snow. His eyes were heavy and his vision blurred. The shapeless forms of the horsemen seemed to become less clear as they came closer. His entire body felt light, as if he was drifting away. A shock of color filled his view, and then in an instant, evaporated. He couldn’t make out what he had just seen. Attributing his delirium to exhaustion, he used his free hand to rub his eyes and attempted to inspect the horsemen, now very near, but again they refused to focus.

 

Again his vision went awry, but this time it was accompanied by a deafening blast. The ground was a deep shade of blue-green and ornate silver architecture rose from the ground. He saw a pale woman, her form still incorporeal. He tried to decipher her features, but again the world was ripped away from him.

 

A valkyrie, he thought—warrior women who guided those who died with honor to the afterlife. He welcomed her embrace. Soon, he hoped, he would walk among his ancestors. He could hear his pursuers now, calling his name. But their voices sounded strange, as if echoed through a long and distant tunnel.

 

They had him. He could feel the hot breath of their horses on his neck, but he couldn’t see them, not clearly. The last thing he saw was the distorted face of his captain, his would-be executioner. It was a face of uncertainty, and then terror as his face was washed in a blinding light.

 

As the image of his captain faded it was replaced, and this time in perfect focus—the valkyrie. She was young, with full lips and skin like alabaster. She held out her hands to him, each one ending in thin, delicate fingers.

 

She leaned closer, and with her lips nearly pressed against his ear she again whispered.

 

“Stay with us.”

A lot of them spend time alone, and they talk to themselves, because they've all gone a little crazy.  However, I need to differentiate talking, musing aloud, and quiet contemplation.

Here's where it gets a bit more tricky:

Two characters know magic and can communicate with each other through their thoughts.  So, this is *like* thinking, except one person can still hear them.

One character has an implant that functions a lot like Siri on the iPhone (I wrote this before it came out) and so he can occasionally think things to himself, and like the telepathy, he will hear a voice in his mind, except nobody else hears his implant's analyses.

The rest of the characters frequently take time to themselves to think about things.

I heard one author suggest using italics to signify thought.  No quotation marks, no ""he thought"", just *italicize it and write it like it's narration.*

I've started editing my book with that concept in mind, and I've found it works in some occasions and feels awkward in others (especially situations where everything stays relatively quiet).  I have one extremely stoic character that spends half the book alone and more or less wordless.  He is obviously thinking things, but I feel it detracts from his quiet-guy persona to have his thoughts broadcast.

So I thought, ""I'd love to know your thoughts on how to handle thoughts.""

Thoughts?




For those interested in seeing a visual of the two methods I'm referring to...

Originally, I had written things like:

&gt;The dread witch Ravioli readied her vial of poison and positioned herself to toss it.

&gt;""Alright, now what have I gotten myself into,"" Charles thought to himself.

&gt;She lobbed the tincture towards the hunter, but he ducked out of the way.

&gt;""Knock it off, witch,"" Charles commanded.

&gt;""Make me.""

&gt;""I'll do it.""

Now, as I'm editing, it's looking more like:

&gt;The dread witch Ravioli readied to throw the vial of poison.

&gt;*Now what have I gotten myself into?*

&gt;She lobbed the tincture towards the hunter, but he ducked out of the way.

I've always had pre-established settings and characters.


A few weeks ago, I had an idea for an original story come to me. I feel fairly confident in the characters I've been developing, but I'm not sure about the world I'm setting everything in. I would love some constructive criticism and any tips you might have about how to make things better. Also, I'm currently planning on publishing this in the form of a webcomic (not sure if that makes much of a difference).


The story takes place in a world inspired by/based on the Viking/Norse civilizations. Geographically, the terrain is very mountainous with valleys and forests between the different ranges. The southern territory (where most of the story takes place) is primarily mountainous with thick forests. The western territory is bordered by ocean with the mountains giving way to hills and sparse patches of forest with a lot of field land. The northern territory is primarily rocky mountains and gorges with vegetation only at the bases. As far as the eastern territory goes, I'm still working on that because I'm not quite sure what I want to do with it.


The villages mostly focus on farming and trade as the time period is fairly peaceful, but many of the citizens are trained for battle (there are still skirmishes over land rights and whatnot). Humans are the dominant species, and they're not aware that dragons exist separately in their own tribes. Because humans used to hunt them for glory and trophies, over many centuries the dragons developed the ability to take a humanoid form and faded into legend. The story focuses around a young woman (recently taking on the role of Oracle in her village) meeting a dragon who was exiled from his tribe. The primary genre's are fantasy, adventure, and romance.

EDIT:

I don't think people actually check back on posts they commented on but I'll do this anyways.

The consensus is that all of the titles are crappy except *maybe* ""Bound in Shadows"" which I still think isn't great. 

So I'm pitching one last option that I've thought of so far, plus I'll explain why I was unsure about it.

""The Ever Changing Door""

The reason I didn't really think it would actually work even though I like the sound is because the door referenced is introduced within the first two pages of the entire book. Introduced in an obvious significant way. Because its part of a character's plot line. It's a decent symbol for that character, though not a huge pivotal piece to the plot, but it's really distant from the other two plot lines.

Either gradually or all of a sudden, portals open up around the world, and evil fantasy armies emerge and wreak havoc.  These armies would consist of orcs, dragons, wizards, etc.  However, it's also the height of the arms race, with tens of millions of troops and machines ready to fight wars on multiple fronts worldwide.

In the continent I am focused on, there is legal slavery of a sort. It is basically classic apprenticeships but for now I'm calling it slavery...if anyone has suggestions on a different term once I describe it, that would be helpful.

Basically, traders or caravans will go to places that are poverty stricken, maybe farms that have had bad crops, and buy children from families who can't support all their kids or need the extra money. Then they will go usually to the major cities and sell the kids to temples, guilds, or craftsmen for a tidy profit. This is completely legal but unregulated and kind of ignored by government.

The ""slaves"", or apprentices, or whatever I call them, would have no choice in this situation so there's a lot of room for abuse but they usually are able to earn their freedom by working off the sum their master bought them for plus interest (more depending on how much of an asshole the buyer is). Generally they are learning a useful trade and then can make their way in the world after they have earned their freedom, while otherwise they would have starved back home, so this system provides an important function.

Again there is room for abuse and not everyone is fair because the system's not well regulated, but generally once someone's grown up there's no way they're going to stay as an apprentice. 

I've already stated that I'm looking for feedback on how I reference the situation, but my main question is more specific. An important detail of the plot has to do with one of the trader caravans (?) which I may need a better term for as well. If you were part of a group of traders/merchants travelling with a few wagons full of goods plus maybe ten or so bought 'slaves'....how would you refer to them?

Are they passengers, or are they merchandise/goods?

Also I know there are a lot of problems with this system right now, I'm only just starting to work it out and it's not central to the plot, just part of a significant backstory.

**Prologue


“I realize now that you’ve grown older, both in height, and knowledge. You are no longer the wide eyed child that sat before me in long forgotten days, fascinated by the intricacies of a butterfly’s wing, or some other simple yet beautiful thing. However though you may be young and able, and I, old and feeble, hobbled by the uncertainty of my brief yet ever approaching future, there are still many lessons that can be learned from me. Look at yourself, so proud and confident, which in and of itself is not entirely a bad thing, nonetheless It troubles me to see the child like wonder fade from your eyes. I’ll be damned if I let you lose yourself!“ 


“And so I will tell you a story, perhaps one that I’ve told a thousand times, but never in its entirety. I will tell you this story… my story… in order that you may benefit from my triumphs and learn from my mistakes, but also, I shall tell you in the hopes that I may at last become honest with myself for what I’ve done and what I’ve failed to do.”


In the west, much further than the cloud covered peaks of the Suncrest Mountains and past the vast seas thereafter lay the massive towers and vibrant fields of the city of Dawn. An altogether peaceful city perched on the Wayleign Sea and at the crossroads of the western world. To Dawn, the haughty dwarves of the Crimson mountains, brought forth from their halls of stone, precious gems which rivaled in size and beauty even the eye of a dragon. From the lush forests of the northern reach, came the high elves on their ghostly white steads bearing elixirs the likes of which could give one man the strength of ten, or in malice filled thought created, ten men the strength of one. From the rolling meadows and wind swept plains to the south of Dawn, flew the nymphs in their chariots of berkenwood, a magical substance lighter than air, carrying with them rare herbs and spices. One could hardly disagree that Dawn was the economic capital of the west.


Moreover, and aside from its monetary prowess, Dawn was fairly intimidating.  Despite the peace that pervaded the area, the city maintained one of the most regulated, equipped, and well trained armies to grace the earth. In fact, Dawn’s armies we’re comparable to those controlled by the Blackheart of Mirk whom all but snuffed out the existence of the world itself in the Third Age. To that end, Dawn’s armies could only be complimented by its tall, ivy encrusted, and battle tested stone walls which we’re rumored to be visible from some fifty leagues away on a clear evening; and its sturdy battlements, topped by haunting concrete angels. Yet, beauty could be found in the serenity brought about by Dawn’s power, and so to its denizens, Dawn’s appearance was comforting.


Finally, Dawn was the center of the scientific and magical world, its engineers, scholars, and magicians bringing to light such advances as: fiend fire, an annoyingly difficult to master, and even more annoyingly difficult to put out, form of magic which left its wielder capable of setting fire even to water; and the soul reaver, an odd piece of machinery imbued with a slight magical incantation which could change a person’s outlook on life in a matter of seconds through the removal of that individual’s soul. Furthermore, the College of Duskfall took residence in Dawn, and could be, in a certain light, seen as the culmination of all human knowledge that ever was and ever will be.


Nevertheless Dawn owed everything to one man, Solomon. Should Dawn have never fallen into his hands we would undoubtedly be living in a very different world, with a very different past, and an even more unforeseeable future. Solomon was the stuff of legends and seemingly flawless in every way. His knowledge of military tactics, economics, and manipulation was equaled by none, his looks were unmatched, and his tact, impeccable. To say the least, the man seethed poise, unnerving even the mightiest of opponents with good reason. Still Solomon was a mystery in and of himself. No one knew of his past, family, or friends, and even more intriguingly, many noted that Solomon arrived in Dawn without warning and without reason slowly working his way towards the throne armed with his bewitching charm, of which few could ignore or disagree with. It also did not go unnoticed, but remained largely unmentioned, that those who did find the ability to oppose Solomon, tended to wind up… gone. It was unnatural and eerie, but what could anyone do without fear of disappearing themselves. 


It was on such an inquiry that I first found myself in the city of Dawn, to search for a close family friend, Thomas Sheradin, a merry fellow with a twinkle in his eye and a hop in his step. Thomas was one to write my family, especially my father, with news of business and matters of everyday life concerning him, and had been ever since He and my father, your great grandfather, started their shipping business together. I was a young man of twenty or so and was sent to Dawn in an attempt to discover why the letters had stopped abruptly, sometimes I wish I’d never gone but such is life. Here is where my story begins.**

The naked girl's face was pallid and swollen with river water, silt crusting along her bony legs and lacerated feet. Her eyes were open to the sky, her slightly open mouth devoid of expression. The corpse had once been a child of nine or ten, but now it was a puddle of sodden flesh that stank of fish and decay, black hair splayed in a tangled, dirt caked mess beneath her head.

Janik crouched in the sand and tilted the dead girl's face, slipping one gloved finger into the open mouth and pulling out the dull gray stone that was tucked beneath the tongue. The stone was a rough cube, carved unevenly with inexpert tools, and it was covered in a fine black powder, the same that coated the inside of the dead girl's mouth. This was the third body that Janik had found spat up from the brown water of the Dirileith.

Prologue- Angels’ Landing 

Faenel stood before the shimmering barrier. His sheer proximity to the insubstantial wall made 
him feel nauseous, and gave him the uneasy sensation that he was fraying at the edges of his being. 
Slowly, he stretched forth his hand. The movement was cautious, but displayed neither tremor nor sign 
of hesitation. Faenel’s hand blurred as it neared the glittering wall of energy, dissolving completely as his 
transparent glassy flesh came into direct contact with it. He nodded, his suspicions confirmed. The Aerin 
had emplaced a nearly flawless dissipation field. No being of pure aether could pass through and 
survive. 

On the other side of the veil towered the massive Memorium. The heart of the Aerin’s celestial 
capital. The memorium was monumentally tall, pointing defiantly upwards, seeming to challenging 
the heavens above. Faenel felt his mouth curl in a rare smile, and allowed himself a fleeting flash of 
satisfaction. How easy it must have seemed to extend such a challenge. Apparently the Aerin had been 
unprepared for its answer. Of course, Faenel couldn’t actually blame them. After all, to the Aerin, his 
people were only a myth, and ancient memory of days gone by. But to Faenel, and what survived of his 
kind, the Aerin were immediate, real. The ancient anathema that had, through their hubris, damned the 
Angelei, and the collected races of Oasis. The Angelei had created a utopia, and the Aerin had robbed 
them of it. Many of Faenel’s brethren had died that day. Centuries had passed, but the day the sky was 
cracked remained vivid and clear in Faenel’s memory. That was one of the blessings of being a perfect 
eternal being. Nothing was ever forgotten. It was also the curse. Faenel remembered the name of 
every brother and sister that had perished as a consequence of the Aerin’s blasphemy. What they had 
dreamed of, joys they had shared, plans they had made together. All gone. All ruined in the blink of an 
eye. 

Around him, both inside and outside of the barrier were littered the bodies of Aerin soldiers. 
There must have been thousands, but it wasn’t enough. The Aerin were fleeting. These bodies would 
have been corpses in a few decades regardless, and new ones would be born to take their places. In a 
generation, it would be as though this slaughter had never happened, Faenel reflected bitterly. And 
what was more, for every hundred Aerin slain, they had obstinately managed to annihilate between 
one and three Angelei. The price would have been unacceptably high, were this initial destruction the 
sole outcome of the battle. Faenel took solace in knowing that it was not however, and that his fallen 
brothers had paved the way for the Angelei’s final act of retribution. 

Another Angelei, this one more feminine in appearance, appeared at Faenels side. He didn’t 
have to look to know it was Aeliel. He knew all of his kind by sensation of presence alone. 

“We’ve eliminated all the remnants,” she reported. But their rearguard held us long enough for 
the bulk of them to escape through their doorway. They destroyed it behind them, we won’t be able to 
march on them on the world below.” 

Faenel shrugged. He hadn’t expected to. It was just as well. The world below held the other 
races, some of which possessed characteristics the Angelei had great cause to fear. With the door shut, 
the Angelei need not fear any counterattack. 

“Some yet remain,” he replied, gesturing to the towering Memorium. “But they’ve nothing to 
sustain them in there. They will soon perish.” 

“The Aerin are foolhardy, but clever,” Aeliel said reflectively. “Doubtless they have emplaced a 
mechanism to sustain this barrier long after the last of them has ceased to draw breath.” 

Faenel nodded his agreement. “As clever as they are, it cannot last forever,” he murmured. His 
meaning was clear to Aeliel. The barrier would fall eventually, and then the Angelei would enter the 
memorium, and part the steel sky, allowing the mighty storm to enter. The Aerin would face judgment 
at last. The Angelei had been stalled, but it would make little difference in the end. 

Book 2 prologue:

Prologue- The General/ Malignancy
	The sky was grey, portending an imminent downpour. It was a good portent, Memir thought. A sign that the Icekeepers’ repair of the Infinity Fountain at Starfall had indeed succeeded in turning back the drought that had for decades plagued the Northern Hemisphere of Solace. 
	But to Memir and those like him, the repair of the Infinity Fountain signified more than just ecological salvation for the planet. For Memir, it was kindling for the weak spark of hope. Hope for a future of peace between the Adamant and the Aerin. Months ago, it had seemed an impossible dream, but today, anything seemed possible.
	Memir’s hopeful spirit was somewhat dampened as the rubble came into site, and he remembered what he’d come here for, and where he was.  This was all that remained of the once mighty fortress of Clan Leviathon. It was here that the Aerin had staged an attack on what they had regarded to be their greatest threat, a clan with the power to unite the other Adamant, and drive back the encroaching Aerin. The attack had resulted in the almost total annihilation of the Leviathonian Adamant. There had been only one survivor Memir was aware of. Ardur, the leader of the united band of Adamant calling themselves the Freebloods, had somehow, as a child not even into adolescence, had escaped extermination. His death, when it came, would be the final act of a total genocide. Never again would an adamant of Pure Leviathonian blood walk on Solace.
	Memir now knew, though he couldn’t remember it, that he, as a child, had been present for this atrocity. The details were lost to him though. All the evidence confirmed that an Ascendent Aerin- or Aerin Augments, as Memir preferred to call himself, had struck the fatal blow, incinerating Fortress Leviathon in one fell blow. But Memir had also been made aware, after conferring with Lesia, that he had not been the only Augment present during the assault. Karinia and he had been deployed as a pair, to ensure the operation’s success. And based on the total attrition of both attacking Aerin and defending Adamant, all had not gone as planned. 
	As he strode towards the rubble, Memir remembered back as far as he could, willing his mind to reach beyond the moment when he woke up, alone and buried in stone debris, to the events that had led to that point. He had vague impression of terror and confusion, but no solid events would resolve themselves.
	Not that he had expected them to. He’d come here on a whim. Had he hoped to find absolution amidst the blasted stones of this monument to Aerin ruthlessness? He wasn’t sure himself. But he was desperate for answers, and he couldn’t shake the feeling- more than a feeling- that there was something crucial to be found buried away beneath the ruins.
	As he clambered onto the beginnings of the ruin, he looked around for a likely spot to start digging. This had been stupid, he realized. It would take weeks to pick through the wreckage, and barring an extraordinary amount of luck, and Memir didn’t believe in luck, he wouldn’t find anything of interest in the first several days.
	He sat down and a marvelously intact section of wall protruding from the pile, and situating his elbows on his thighs, propped is chin up with his hands.
	He looked out over the cliff to the great ocean below. Reptilian coastdarts swooped and wheeled, their screeches blending with the rumble of the waves below. It was giving Memir a headache.
	Without warning, the headache intensified. Memir winced at the sensation of pressure behind his eyes, accompanied by a greying at the edges of his vision.
	He stood and began walking back the way he had come, as he did, the pressure lessened, and his vision became normal again.
	Memir stopped walking. Uncertainly, he turned, and approached the rubble again. As he did, the headache returned, and the grey again fuzzed at the edges of his vision.
	Determinedly, Memir pushed towards what had once been the center of the fortress, squinting as the headache crescendoed to a nearly unbearable level. His vision was tunneled to the point that he stumbled several times. And then, somehow, he knew he had found what he’d come for.
	Pushing the pain aside, Memir extended his arms. Slowly, the chunks of debris before him rose into the air. Memir suspended them in the air for a few seconds, waiting to see if there were any left. When nothing else rose, he violently swept his arms to one side. The rubble followed the motion, tumbling and scattering until they came to rest once more. Memir surveyed the dimple he’d created, which took longer than usual, owing to his migraine impaired vision. There was more rubble in the crater. Memir stared at it, nonplussed, until he noted the silvery quality of this pile of scrap. He hadn’t been able to aefect the remaining debris because it was adamantian steel. The bizarrely aetherproof metal.
	Memir descended into the crater, and began shifting the metallic debris with his hands. He worked as quickly as he could, headless of the way the rubble tore through his fine white gloves and into the flesh of his hands.
	At last, he removed a particularly heavy piece of steel, straining an arm in the process, and found only empty space beneath. The pain in his head was overpowering now, threatening to make him pass out. Heedlessly, he dropped to his stomach and reached into the hole he’d created. His hand brushed something. He felt around it, trying to get a grip, when suddenly, something grabbed him instead. 
	Memir Jerked his hand free in startlement, and the thing came with it. The migraine was still excruciating, but Memir was becoming accustomed to the sensation. His vision was relatively clear as he observed the thing gripping him.
	A tentacle like appendage had wrapped itself around his arm, which was starting to go numb. Attached to the appendage, secured against Memir’s arm was a mass of what appeared to be tangled cord. The cord was apparently made of a crystalline substance. Perhaps it was just his vision swimming from the migraine, but Memir could swear that the coils were writhing. He squinted at the thing. All his instincts screamed to get away from the thing, but Memir was sure it was for this grotesque thing that he had come.
	Memir continued to stare, trying to think of what the thing reminded him of. It was small, about half again as big as his fist. And those branching, crazed tangles. And then he realized what it looked like. He was holding a brain. A crystalized, warped, brain.
	And at last, Memir began to understand. Slowly, his face twisted into an unnatural smile.
	“Hello again, Karinia,” he murmured. He closed his eyes and smiled. Exultant tears trickled down his face, and the sky started to weep with him.

I'm not sure if I did a good job with the editing, so I will gladly take any input you have. 

Chapter 1

A stir in the air, unnoticeable to any not looking for it, gave away their secret to the empty hall outside of their closed door.

  “It is done. We may all be killed for this,” a figure whispered as he peeped around the hall, “or possibly worse.”

  “Don't go second guessing on us!” one of the others replied. Each one present understood the risk, but that didn't mean that they liked it. “Make no mistake, think a thought about this outside of this meeting, and I will personally slit your throat!”

  “In the name of Drasill, no one is to be killed,” the largest of those present retorted. “I have the most to lose, and yet I haven’t lost my mind as you, Arsaun. Save it for out there. By the name of the One, we must succeed, or he may fail himself. Who knows to whom the Sardinale pledge, if to anyone? All I know is if we fail and Drasill dies, may it be postponed, we will all become slaves to the Fallen.”

  A snarl covered Arsaun’s face underneath his robe, but he deferred none the less. “Let’s just get this over with.” Arsaun’s tone was cold but his severity would burn a flame.

  “By my sacred name, I will fight the Fallen and try to forestall the End as long as possible,” the hooded ones pledged. “No word in this meeting is to be spoken outside, by my hope for the Life.” As they finished swearing the oath, the ominous figures left the room. After the rest left the room and he was alone, the One with the Most to Lose sighed. He knew that brooding would not help, and he could not afford to doubt now. The world could not afford for him to doubt.

Chapter 2

  The birds no longer chirp as cheerfully as they once had. The rooster call is just a throe  heard by many, and echoed by even more. In a village, once known as Vivetrous, the cry for salvation seems exceptionally anguished today. 

  Still new to the entire slavery ordeal, most of the villagers have not quite reached the point of brokeness, which in their cases would probably be seen as a blessing. The inhabitants of the newly named Necrity sob openly and often, unaware and unconcerned with whoever was watching. No one judges another for showing what some would call weakness, they all had done it at some point, and they would all do it again. The inhabitants of this tiny village have almost forgotten their once care-free lives, and replaced the memories with cold, distant hate. Not hating each other, not even hating the gods. No, their murderous thoughts were for their overlord. One young man seemed to have more frost in his heart than any other villager. A blizzard raged inside of him, deluding his wits. Finally, he was at the tipping point of sanity.

  Barely old enough to be called a man, John knows little of this world. He remembers freedom, the smell of flowers, the sweet embrace of the raging river while swimming, and a seeming infinite number of other pleasures now out of reach. Just a year ago, then nineteen year old boy, he had little care in the world. Done with children’s lessons, he would try to find his passion, his calling. Now his calling came from a LIZARD, of all things, as it shouted orders for the villagers to work harder.

  “Hurry it up! I don't have to feed you, you know? I could simply let you starve and find someone else to do your work.” Searve's voice exploded through the town. John had seemed to develop a new sense when it came to hearing Searve. Everyone had. A whip cracked onto John’s back, and he could not stop the shriek of pain. As he tilled the land, he released a silent prayer to the gods to save his people from this plague. Gadflies upon the land, thriving on the living, the Brinte seemed to feed on their blood no less than ticks. “Slave boy, you don’t seem to understand, so let me speak a little slower. I will kill you unless the field is done within the week.” Searve didn't need the extra emphasis in his voice. The word kill always stirred the villagers to work harder. No one dared not try the giant gecko. He had seen people killed by this monster, and for now, he would obey.

  The land John worked was quite fertile, which is why the local Brintian ruler pressed so hard to get it done. Farming had always been the biggest part of anyone’s life here, even before the invasion. An array of bushes, trees, vines, cultivated roots, flowers and whatever else imagined could be seen throughout the year. Taking advantage of plants growing during different seasons, Viventians were practically guaranteed food at all times. In the autumn, apples decorated the ground, too many to count. In the winter, John would always be the first one to start harvesting the cabbage. His mother made a cabbage stew that brought envy to the entire village. Carrots and cabbage, imported pepper, garlic, beef broth all mixed to form a conglomerate of flavor to appease even the worst of moods. Unfortunately, it was not quite time to plant the cabbage seeds, he wasn’t even making food! Ever since the Brinte barged in, they demanded more cash crops, tobacco and cotton mainly. Unheard of before Searv’s convoy, these plants now dominated the fields, leaving only a few huddled spots of land here and there for food. This created a small panic about whether they would have enough food for the winter, but only time could tell.
John turned his head around, hearing the most pleasant sound he had ever heard. Silence. He was alone, tending the field by himself. Searv must have moved on to the next worker, making his daily rounds of overseeing every field.  His mother and sister were probably off helping to prepare dinner, the most dangerous job of all. The Brinte had a nasty temper, and if something was so much as a little tough, the cooks would be severely beaten. Of course, that was only for Searv’s food and the other Brinte. when they decided to visit. No one cared about the food the townspeople would eat, not even the townspeople themselves!

  While there was only one Brinte in the village, John knew that one was enough to bully the entire town. As tall as a man and a half, he was an army in one body. As with the other Brinte, Searve had claws that were weapons themselves, although they had used swords and spears during the invasion. His muscles, while not particularly large, worked with mechanical precision. He never exerted himself, even when heaving a poor soul into the air to be tortured one last time before their death.

  Searve's dark green scales seemed impenetrable, at least as John remembered from the battle when the Brinte first arrived. Most of that day was lost in the deepest recesses of the boy's mind, forced to be forgotten so that he couldn't relive that tragic event. Not a single enemy was killed that day. The reptilian race was able to sweep through the village while causing minimal damage. Their victory lied in one soul-crushing act, killing the entire council. Once that was done, before they even had a chance to comprehend what had happened, before a funeral could be planned, they were forced to pledge to the victors.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_154dlg,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/154dlg/critique_the_first_chapter_and_a_half_of_my_novel/,

It's interesting how a character is often defined by his or her flaws.   I also realized that as I write characters having clear, defined and sometimes irrational flaws make the character easier to write.

It also keeps them from being dull.  

I was looking over my draft and realized I had defined this pretty clearly for my supporting cast but not very clearly for my MC.   It wasn't brought front and center.

So I panicked, for a moment I had heavy concerns that I hadn't defined any.  I started to leaf through the draft and found relief that I had indeed not placed a focus on his flaws, but wrote with his flaws in mind.  It's merely a matter of bringing those flaws forward and more to light.

Has anyone else had this epiphany?   Or have you written something and caught your lack of flaws too late and left a irreparable mess?  (I know I have, but never realized that was the problem!)

In light of my MC, I always write Derrek as a coward and having impeccably bad initial judgement.   When I initially started writing him I had him be a fairly good judge of character, but I found it more interesting (and appropriate giving the time resets) that he is actually laughably bad at reading people's true intentions.  

As far as his cowardice goes, it surfaces more in his regard to dealing with people rather than situations.   Running into a burning building?   No problem.   Confronting a sword wielding bandit?  Not so much.

One of the elements in that prompt generator is the idea of 'theme family'. 

The way I'm approaching the generator, there are two levels of theme - the first is the ""family,"" and the second the (as Chuck Wendig puts it) ""central dramatic argument,"" the thing argued for and against in a story.

An example: a theme family might be ""pride""; central dramatic arguments around that theme family might be ""Pride goeth before the fall"" (to start with a classic), ""Pride blinds us to the outside world,"" ""Pride is what keeps you upright when all the other supports are gone,""  etc.

While the central dramatic argument is both intensely personal, and far too variable to be useful in a random generator, the theme family, being broader, seems to be something that can be usefully captured.

And here I am, trying to capture a big set of them.

I'm considering what to do for NaNoWriMo and have a really beefy collection of notes. I've got a lot of what I'm planning on writing about sketched out, but there's one point I'm having trouble with. I want to write really ""naturalistic"" fantasy - almost without any fantasy elements, in fact, like alternate history, but! I'm trying to incorporate an apocalyptic theme.

The gods in my world aren't really meant to be, you know, gods in that sense - they don't really wield supernatural powers or much care about other people's affairs. I don't want to commit one way or the other to the gods actually existing, in fact. To the extent that they *do* exist, though (ie, that my characters believe in them,) they resemble Shinto gods and demons - ancient, awe-inspiring forces of nature. They don't really have a ""plotline"" like in Norse mythology - they just always have and always will exist, indefinitely.

At the same time, they are retreating from the world, heading deeper and deeper into the forests, and it is slowly dying in the wake of their departure. My characters need to come to terms with this, and begin to consider their motivation to struggle onwards in the wake of the apocalypse. Since I don't care for my narration to be especially omniscient, I'm left floundering for a reason *why* the gods in my story should be doing this. A few motivations I considered for the gods' disappearance were the destruction of something of theirs - a sacred grove or something like that - or a general destruction of nature theme, a la Princess Mononoke. As I mentioned, though, I don't want these gods to be very human - they just don't care what the puny humans are up to, so people's sacred spaces are meaningless to them - and the destruction of nature theme doesn't work with the plot I've got going so far. I want these gods to be mysterious enough that some kind of Judeo-Christian or Germanic apocalyptic scenario - a war of the gods or whatever - wouldn't really work either, since their doings are fairly unknowable. And I feel like it would be a cop-out to never explain why they're doing this, or to just provide some scientific hand-wave for the world's death (a new ice age or something) since my characters would have no way of knowing about this.

So! Does anyone have any great suggestions for why this kind of thing might happen? Are there any mythological sources I should look at, for example?

Since then, I've boiled all of that down to a somewhat medieval-esque society in which their most beloved Goddess was actually a queen who united a large area under one dominion. There's no magic in the ""flash, bang, fireball"" sense, there's a certain amount of herbal medicine, astronomy, and other old world incarnations of science and mathematics (dissecting stuff, using symbols as codes and codebreaking, etc etc).

So basically the only thing vaguely fantastical about it is that it doesn't happen in an area that actually exists on Earth - though it is earthlike, with basically the same systems of atmosphere, gravity - and all those other things which we take for granted.

1348079145.0,5,self.fantasywriters,105c7u,Having trouble justifying the founding/politics of a major city.,Zegarek,5,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/105c7u/having_trouble_justifying_the_foundingpolitics_of/,"**I apologize in advance if this ends up being a bit long winded. This is actually my first time discussing my project with anyone and it feels really good to just put ideas out there.**

I'm in the process of fleshing out a timeline/outline for a novel I plan to write. In this world two factions (Gora and Kevosi) war for ages and finally come to terms with one another. As a sign of good faith for the future the two sides form an economic pact so that both may flourish. One product of this pact is the forming of a unified central (and as of now unnamed) city where the people of each country may live and trade their goods and coexist peacefully. Eventually this city uses its economic nature to grow in power to the point that it overshadows its initial creators and begins to cause problem for everyone through its economic might.

Both the Gora and Kevosi's home lands are ruled through traditional monarchies. I know that I want this city to be run differently, if the focus of the city is on balance and perceived harmony then it makes sense that it is run by a council of selected representatives from each area of Gora and Kevosi. The best and brightest from each country would come together and rule the city in a way that is, at least in the beginning, respectful of each country's needs.

The main problem I'm having is how to select these representatives. An election seems too modern and clean of a method considering the nature of the Gora and Kevosi's cultures, yet a tournament of strength seems too violent of a method considering the new city's principle purpose is economic. I'd like to give the representatives an air of divinity, as if they were selected by the Gods, so their decisions go unquestioned throughout the years as corruption sets in. 

Maybe something similar to the early Romans/Greek political system could work? I know they often held councils for the sake of politics but I'll admit I don't know much about that time period or its practices. 

**TL;DR: How do you reasonably select members of a new city's council when ruling by committee is a new concept to an area predominantly ruled by monarchies?** 

Thanks in advance for any of your responses!

**EDIT** Wow thanks for all of the awesome advice everyone. You're bringing up a lot of things I didn't consider the first time around and I really think this will help me develop my world. For some extra background on the two countries involved in this I'll copy and paste a comment I made lower in the thread:

""The setting is a pretty standard medieval style story. If I had to place a date relative to earth's history I'd put it between 1200-1400. A bit of a stretch I know but I'm still hammering out the details as far as what technology is available. The two races are actually descendants of normal humans. In the past vanilla humans ruled the land before the majority of them were abducted by an outside force. The remaining humans scattered across the continent and lived through a dark age before the Gods discovered them.
Each of the two Gods picks a group of humans on opposite ends of the continent and blesses with the strengths that they value as deities.

One group, the Kevosi, gets blessed to be tall and lean and agile. They value stoic tradition and the idea of working for the kingdom but they become very entrenched in their ways and ave difficulty adjusting to major shifts in the world. Their main focus in life is to learn of their origins and where they came from. Ruins from the previous human civilizations dot the landscape and the king of the Kevosi is obsessed with discovering every last bit of information they can from the ruins thinking it will reveal the Kevosi's true purpose in the world.

The Gora on the other hand get blessed to be stout and strong, but extremely brash. They value individual achievement and heroic feats but their attitudes often cause them to war among themselves. They eventually learn to create a loose alliance between the different clans of Gora but they continually strive to keep the identity of their individual clans. They overall despise the Kevosi thanks to their conflicts and as a result refuse to acknowledge the past as an influence on the present. Instead they focus on understanding the world around them through science such as astrology, physics, etc.

Hope this helps flesh things out a bit. There's still more to it, especially in regards to what happened to the humans, but that's the main info describing the Gora and Kevosi.""

1347794237.0,4,self.fantasywriters,zyu5w,"So I noticed people like to have feedback on their magic system, anyone care to give feedback to mine?",Metalscavenger,7,3,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/zyu5w/so_i_noticed_people_like_to_have_feedback_on/,"First off, I'm not an avid reader, so if my system blatantly rips off any other story's system, I probably won't know. So please go easy on the plagiarism with me. :P And since I'm not an avid reader, I'm not an avid writer, but I do enjoy coming up with these stories and systems/structures.

So here's my system:
Everyone can do magic, there's no exclusivity in my world. The possibilities of magic are only limited by the imagination and knowledge of the user. 

To give an example: If a mage would summon fire, he doesn't actually summon real fire, he simulates it. The fire he summons is limited by what he/she knows about the aspects of fire. 
So to optimize your firespells, you need to study real fire. The more aspects of the world you know, the more you can combine to, for example, make a fire that burns through steel, leaves wounds that can't be healed, etc.

Because of this, it takes very much time and effort to effectively practice magic, so many people don't even start or give up after a while. Amongst the truely dedicated mages, there is a practice to study life with the intent to increase it's longevity. The truely skilled ones can do this to a point where they are considered ageless. As they cannot die from old age anymore(but can still be killed in combat).

Also, if skilled mages have children, their children will be born with more affinity(potential) for magic than their peers. That is why very powerful mages often come from long lines of mages.

Magic can also be channeled through objects. This can be done through any object, but not every object has a positive outcome for the spell. 
The best effects are gained from objects like wands, staves, swords, arrows. Long things without much stuff protruding from it. The philosophy here is the same as with non-magic combat. 
The bigger the item, the more damage it can do, but the slower it is. You can see a wand as a dagger and a staff as a claymore.

As for enchanting, enchanted items are rare and very valuable. Why? Because when you want to enchant something, you actually cut off a part of your mana potention(:see next paragraph) and seal it in the item. Thus making the mage weaker in the process. One can go as far in this to actually  lose all his/hers magic affinity and making the item useless to the creator, since magic is needed to use the enchanted item.

Mana speaks for itself, the way I handle it in my system is like real life stamina or strength. Each person has a potential for it and their limits are different. Like one person can lift 50 pounds today and another can lift 75 pounds on the same day. But when they reach their limits, person nr 1 can lift 150 pounds, whereas person 2 can only lift 140 pounds. Same with magic.

To elaborate on the children of mages if person 1 has only reached half of his limit when he has children and person 2 has reached 75% of his limit when he has children. The potential of person 2's children will be increased more percentually than person 1's children. That is why mages in my world often have children at a very late age (can be at hundreds of years, in extreme cases even thousands of years).

Magic can also be lethal to the user if he doesn't know his limits. If the mana pool of the mage runs dry, he will not be unable to use magic. His spells will instead start draining his lifeforce. This has lead to some scolars to believe that magic is in fact excessive life force. The feeling of having your life force drained is in fact not that much different from the feeling of your mana being used for spells. 

So new mages are obligated by law to have a more experienced mage overseeing their spells. When they have made significant progress and can use magic safely, they get a mark on the forehead. This mark shows them to the world as someone who can use magic at will, but does not mean he is a fully learned mage(something which does not actually exist, since there is more to learn than one mage can learn in his life, even if he is ageless).

I hope you stuck with me till the end and forgive any spelling errors I made. English is not my primary language, you see.

Lately I've hit a slump in life and have no idea what I want to do and its killing me. I started to read my harry potter books that has been collecting dust. I hated reading when I was in school, I would usually watch the movies of books. I was never good with english in school, it was my worst and most hated subject. I could never get a grasp on all the technicalities of it which frustrated me to no end. So after reading the first HP book I decided hey, why not write something of my own. So I spent the last hour writing this part of an intro. I re read it and it is sort of formated like harry potters (I was completely oblivious when I wrote it). But I just want to know if theres any punctuation / gramatical errors and stuff like that in general in this and if it is interesting or not.


The moonlight seeped through the leaves of the towering trees, which seemed to be as tall as skyscrapers, that littered his field of view, their bark deep brown and wrinkly like the skin of an elephant. He was nearing the object at the end of the dirt path, like he has every single night for the passed month. The web of light, that filled the space between him and the object, slowed him down as if it were real. He was glad, last time he had to avoid stone golems that wanted to use him as a chair. Inch by inch he edged closer to the now visible object, parting his way through, what used to be webs were now tangled vines made of white light, with his hands. As he got closer he could tell that it was a golden book placed upon a white marble pedestal, it was as if he forgot what it looked like every time, basking in the joy of discovery. He was now in arms reach of the book, which looked to be glowing a soothing and enticing golden light under the radiant ring of moonlight that surrounded it. It was as if all the evil in the world of vanish if the tips of his fingers met with the surface of the book. He reached for it. 

BOOM. Blinding white light now filled his vision as if a grenade exploding in his hands. He hoped maybe this time he would finish the dream and open the damned book that had been taunting him the past month. The light slowly dimmed. There was a face about an inch from his. His face was now usually warm and slimy. The light equalized and he could recognize, that familiar grey face with black stripes running diagonally across its face and those glowing brown eyes. It was Jasper his cat. Every morning at precisely 7:30am Jasper would somehow break into his room, even tho he locked it every night, jump on his face and lick him awake. He would then try and sleep in a little more but Jasper wouldn’t allow such a luxury and spread cat saliva on his face like butter on toast. He pushed her aside and sat up like a robot staring at the clock, waiting for the siren that wasn’t built in as the alarm function. It was now 7:50am, Jasper stared at him from the corner of his room and put her paws to her ears which was odd for it seemed very human-like for a cat. 7:51am.

“There's still a week before school,” he whined under his breath. ""Here it comes""

Magic within Lysthera takes the form of singing, rather than of spells or potions. Mankind barring the Outlands has forgotten the ways of song, and as such is unfamiliar with magic and has no comprehension of it. The Outlands know of and practise magic, but do not understand it fully and more often than not create abominations from their songs. The Kan’stinn are the only ones who truly understand the song, and even they did not discover it – in their own legends The Song was created by the union of the Heavens and the Seas, and is the most basic fundament of life. It can be used to sing almost anything into existence, living or not, but life cannot be sung out of the world – it can be destroyed with other songs, but no song exists to fully remove it. It can also summon into the world things that are mobile but not truly living, such as the Stonewraith– a vassal of a singer who is elsewhere. Singing takes its toll, and those men who practise it often find themselves having greatly reduced lifespans. For the men of the Outlands some find themselves living as few as thirty years, and some die within a year of joining the Stormchoir.

These men embodied the very vices they claimed to protect the people from, a monument to hypocrisy, whose heartless abuse of position had destroyed untold innocents.
	Across the face of the balconies were intricate engravings of mankind, wretched, lifeless beings, toiling in vain in the poisoned soil, backs bent and twisted in pain.  Portrayals of crucified men, men being enslaved by others, women and children sick and famished.
	Baru, great god of Indantium, wielding his golden scepter, spanned the entire ceiling, radiating light down on the few mortals that were on their knees, looking up at him, and leaving the rest to their darkness.  The message was clear; only through submission to Baru could mankind escape death and toil, and to deny him was to condemn oneself to endless suffering.

	The jury of commons shuffled nervously before this spectacle.  Never before had someone so boldly stood before the Clerical council, 	so unapologetically defied the will of Baru.  His eyes shone with intelligence and reason, his posture signified ability and confidence.  This man stood fully aware of his humanity, without reservation or guilt.
	His clear baritone voice resonated throughout the cold audience chamber, calm and commanding.

Four pieces of supplementary data:

•	A Library in my novel is someone that memorizes vast amounts of information. Paper is fairly scarce so it's a necessary method of record keeping.

•	A Dimanagul is someone from our world that has come to this one (Pange). While they don't have the capacity for magic they can 'cheat death' by returning to the last statue of the Goddess they visited.

•	A Managul that has no clear limitation on magical potential but is still bound by normal rules of capacity. Eg. Can use all forms of magic when people typically can only use two.

•	Gelbane is the largest and most powerful country on the main continent of Pange. In the past 50 years they have had two major wars once against Erdak that ended in peculiar victory (a mysterious natural disaster that wiped out the Erdaki primary force) and once against Dendarg that led to a tactical defeat (smaller numbers but better trained fighters).

The King of Geldbane, Darius Solace, is a Library renowned for his accuracy of information and vast retention and the ability to intentionally forget information. He is a second generation king (Kings in Geldbane are rarely succeeded by their heirs). His training as a library was cut short by the death if his father and he was placed on the throne under the guidance of the Grand Libraries at age 15. He was an effective ruler the following year and began to formulate efficient systems for running the country and addressing its population troubles.

His closest subordinates were two brothers that served as his bodyguard and enforcer. He dubbed them his sword and shield. Despite being somewhat heavy handed King Darius was fairly popular, as the nation of Geldbane started to prosper. His efficient leadership and the annexed wealth earned in the war against Erdak contribute to this.

The northern part of Erdak was left uninhabitable due to the aforementioned disaster but Darius offered fair pay to Erdaki willing to venture into their now poisonous nation to gather natural resources.
Darius learned the details of the Dimanagul at this time and used his resources to find and gain control of him. It didn't take long for him to discover it was a man named Clayton Cobb. Clayton was travelling with a woman named Beatriz Adakasin. Darius discovered she was none other than the Managul, a powerful magician that has actively sought out Clayton to manipulate him.

----

Darius (around age 18) divided his time between trying to secure the Dimanagul and investigating reasons the Managul would want to seek him out. History had shown that Dimanagulus made habit of killing Managuls. They are their natural predators. However, Beatriz has successfully seduced Clayton for some unknown purpose.
Finally the truth became known when King Darius factored in an old prophecy that mentioned the relation of the fall of Geldbane and the Dimanagul. Clayton and his kin weren't aiming to destroy anything, but rather he was a tool that could be used to destroy everything. Darius's father, Guiren Solace, had used the 'power' of the Dimanagul to cause the tragedy in Erdak and save his nation from being conquered in one fell swoop.

It was at that point he became obsessed with understanding everything there was to know about the Dimanagulus. He had no interest in the Managul as her threat was plain to see. As King he had greater interest in information than raw power. He viewed his father's 'use' of the Dimanagul as short sighted and planned to use his own much more intelligently.

Darius manipulates Clayton into thinking Beatriz was planning to bring about the prophetic end and tricks him into killing her (Despite Clayton and Beatriz developing real feelings for each other). While her motivations were selfish, she intended to try and prevent the calamity and be hailed as the force that prevents it.

Darius realizes the very real threat looms over Geldbane and it has degraded to a point where the very people that had assumed to be a threat now are the only means to stop it. The King, well versed in the 'rules' of the Dimanagul uses Clayton to gather information he shouldn't have while offering him an empty life of comfort.
His father had been short sighted in his use of the Dimanagul. Darius would not make the same mistake. Once content with the information he could get from Clayton, Darius (Around age 28) tricks Clayton into taking his own life in despair... The one way to permanently kill a Dimanagul.

----

Darius bides his time over the next ten years (Darius is now around 38), patiently awaiting the arrival of a new Dimanagul (Derrek Graymer). He stages his own death and exploits his extremely limited public exposure to travel the continent as a simple Bard. He found his sword a bit too willful, so he made him a Marytr in the war against Dendarg. His shield remains a loyal vassal even in light of his 'death'. This gives him the freedom to get the rest of the answers he needs to stop the impending calamity. This time however, he would control the Managul (Zammela Glemeis) as well, and his rule would be absolute. He plans to returns to his rightful place on the throne as the hero that saved Geldbane and perhaps all of Pange.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,1342469782.0,,title,True,t3_wntgg,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/wntgg/king_darius_solace_what_do_you_think_of_my/,

Synopsis:

When an average Joe's reflection in the mirror switches places with him, he finds himself trapped in a strange mirror world, battling his way back to the other side so that he can stop his reflection from destroying the life he knows.

“Have you ever wondered why so many people in prison claim to be innocent? It’s ‘cause most of ‘em are,” Dozier whispered.

On the other side of the mirror, lies a horrific world where each of us has an image, our violent replica, capable of fulfilling our darkest desires, and only released into our world when we’re unable to follow through with an evil deed. Gabe Cutter, an average paper pusher, has his life ripped out from under him when his image switches places with him, hell bent on destroying the life Gabe knows, and killing his cheating fiance’. Now, stuck on the other side of the mirror, Gabe must join together with a band of stranded survivors and find a way to get back to his world before his image destroys it. Along the way he battles his way through maniacs, monsters, and ultimately his own heart, as he realizes that the woman he’s been trying to save...wasn’t worth the price of admission.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_uhjot,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/uhjot/new_writer_looking_for_advice_read_my_book_free/,

I'd like to incorporate this language into the story to start building the world, but I feel like the story is impeded by my using the language and then explaining what the word is every time.  For example:

""Push, El'Cadiq, push!"" I heard the maten, a midwife-in-training, cry from inside the lodge. My mother groaned in response and grunted as she, no doubt, tried to push harder. I, like everyone else in my tribe, sat by the roaring fire. The energy surrounding us pulsated with excitement, but fear fringed the edges. Alton, as he instructed me to call him while he was with us, held my hand while I sat on his lap. Despite my mild distaste for him, I gripped his first two fingers tightly from nerves. His thumb stroked my wrist, trying to ease my state of mind.

""Success!"" an older midwife, the tenelma, shouted from inside, followed by the wails of a newborn. Alton leaped to his feet, gathering me up in his arms. He quickly swept into the lodge, setting me down on the dirt floor. As a seven-year-old, I let the grown-ups talk and cry and cheer over the successful birth, while I watched from the shadows of the corner. A strange, quiet buzzing was touching on the edges of my hearing, but I couldn't place it.

The frail tenelma wrapped the newborn in a soft fur of an artidae while it continued to shriek at the top of its lungs. I wasn't so sure on my feelings for my new sibling yet, but I greatly wished it would be quiet so I could listen for where the buzzing was coming from. The maten cooed softly at the newborn and Alton kissed my mother repeatedly, his crooked grin never leaving his face.

""Pana..."" my mother said quietly, brushing off Alton's kisses. ""Pana, come meet your younger sister."" She smiled at me, her sweaty face glowing with radiance. A brief wave of relief washed over me; I was glad I didn't get an annoying little brother like my friend, Whena. However, apprehension filled me as I came nearer to my mother, and the bundle of weeping flesh the maten had given to her. I looked down upon it while Alton came up behind me and placed his big hands on my shoulders. It was wriggling in the confines of its blanket and its cheeks and eyes were a pinkish red from crying so much.

""What shall her first name, er...her Nuel'nalta be, my dear?"" Alton asked, his foreign tongue making it difficult for him to pronounce our words properly.

""Valna,"" my mother said, her pointer finger tracing a small line from Valna's forehead to the tip of her nose. This immediately silenced her crying and she opened her big, green eyes, staring at us all for a few seconds before becoming fixated on me. The green eyes signified she took after my mother as an Earth Catcher, in our language, a siauramos.

I finally understood where the faint buzzing was coming from. ""She's powerful..."" I muttered. Valna blinked and her eyes were suddenly blue. I frowned. ""Muma...""

The tenelma gasped loudly, rushing over to my mother and pushing me aside, into Alton. ""This child...she has been blessed by our creator!""

I've been pursuing the insane for the last few years - developing a text-based RPG (a MUD, for those of you who are into that) basically on my own. I work on it when I get breaks from research and other academic-like pursuits, and while I love doing it, it's very lonely work.

I've recently started making myself use the pomodoro method to get things done, just in the same way that I used it to push my way through my dissertation. Still, in this type of world-building, you have to write a gazillion 'place' descriptions, and after a while you just want to write 'THERE ARE A LOT OF TREES HERE. JUST KEEP GOING.' or 'YOU'RE ON THE PLAINS, OKAY? IT'S GRASS AND SOMETIMES RODENTS OR OTHER ANIMALS!'

The need to finish developing tons and tons of wilderness and a few small points of interest before I can bring in player testers (and thus, inspiration/requests for new mini-areas and other such things) has been overwhelming. I was able to knock out one area in a day, but when there are 23 of them to complete, it's a lot. I also have a family who would downright despise what I'm doing, so I have to do a lot of 'closet writing' for the next few months until I move out of state and am back on my own.

Most people who do this work have at least one collaborator. I've had people drop in ideas here and there over the years, but it's really just been me - and it's hard to keep being creative when you don't have anyone you can just pop on IMs and flesh out an idea with.

Anyway, I just wanted to see if there might be anyone else in [/r/fantasywriters](/r/fantasywriters) who could commiserate.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_qi17v,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/qi17v/is_anyone_else_on_the_nonnovelstory_path_or/,

Is there enough going on here?",jp_in_nj,6,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/qf6wm/help_please_is_there_enough_going_on_here/,"Background: Hawk's ex girlfriend (Cory) has just been murdered in a bar by what he thinks is a ghost (Evan James Wright). The cops have cleared him of wrongdoing (he tried to fight it off, and failed), but Detective Dow understandably wants info.

This is the second half of chapter 2; we started with a bang. Part 1 of chapter 2 got him free from suspicion of murder, and I'm pretty happy with it.

There isn't a lot of conflict in this scene, but I need to a) get him free, and b) get Det. Dow to take more than a passing interest in him.


----------


Dow led him to the manager's office, a tiny faux-wood paneled room with a drop ceiling and a desk with a computer and a black high-backed chair that balanced precariously on one pin-thin leg. Hawk looked at the chair for a moment. It was better than looking at the card.

The fluorescents buzzed with a high whine that made him clench his teeth. Too bright, after the bar. Hawk stood in the entrance, blinking stupidly in the near-silence, hearing the sound of his own dry eyes closing and opening, loud as a breaking neck. He focused on the buzzing instead. It almost helped.

Dow perched on the desk and waved him toward the seat. The chair rocked gently when he laid his hand on its back. His skin burred faintly.

""I'll stand, thanks.""

She shrugged. ""Where do you live, Hawk?""

He told her most of the truth, that paying work had been hard to come by and he was between places. He gave her Mercy's address, and she wrote it down in a pad that she tucked back into her suit pocket.

""You're not under arrest, Hawk. So I don't need to read you your rights. But I do need you to tell me the truth. What happened here tonight?""

He could have refused. Another night, maybe he would have refused. But he was sick with what he'd done--what he'd been unable to do. And so he found himself talking. 

He left out the fact that Cory had killed Evan James Wright when she was twelve years old. Left out his suspicion that Conrad Ross was behind the dead man's return, that this was personal between the two of them, Ross making good on his promise to make Hawk pay for his daughter's death. But everything else, he told her. About the girl who'd thought he was trying to pick her up, about Cory coming in, and how his relationship with her had ended badly, though he didn't say why. He told Dow that Cory had come in looking for him to help her, that he'd tried. And that he'd failed.

He didn't say *again* aloud but in his mind it was all he heard.

And then she led him through the story again, and a third time. Looking for holes and inconsistencies, he knew from experience. She asked if he recognized the killer, why he thought the man--or, if not a man, whatever he was--had come for Cory. He answered the same way every time. He didn't recognize the killer. He didn't know why Cory would be targeted. 

After what seemed like hours, at last she seemed satisfied. Or, if not satisfied, at least done with him. Either would be good enough. The adrenaline and the alcohol had fled his system with the story, and he could barely keep his eyes open. He just wanted to go back--for a moment he almost thought *home* but then he remembered it was only Mercy's couch. Home enough, as long as he picked up a bottle on the way there. Drunk enough, he wouldn't feel a thing.

""You're free to go, Hawk,"" she told him, sliding off the desk. And then, as he looked up from the floor, she slid the last question in like a dagger.  

""One more thing. You say you saw raw spellshadow coming off of the killer. Can you tell me about that?"" 

He was bleary, didn't get it. ""What's to tell?""

""What it looks like."" Something in her voice got his attention. He brought her face into focus with an effort, found her eyes intent on him. Cop's eyes, hard and cynical and opportunistic. ""How you can see it.""  

Hawk got that same cliff-edge sense he'd had when her spellrod had been trained on him. This was a different cliff, maybe less of a fall. Maybe more. She thought she sensed a lie. Or maybe she thought she had a way to turn him into some kind of tool. Maybe she had a relative in one of the megacorps, someone she could sell him to. Whatever it was, it wasn't an edge he wanted to topple over.

""It's nothing,"" he told her. ""Some people can see auras, right?""

She said nothing, only looked at him. Time stretched and crawled. Hawk shifted uncomfortably, thinking of where the questions would lead. To the others, inevitably. And they hated him enough lately, he didn't need to add police to the mix. 

Dow held her silence. Waited.

""I can't be the only one who can do it,"" he said at last. 

She leaned forward. ""You're the only one I ever met. How?""

Hawk shrugged. ""I don't know what to tell you."" Which was true, as far as it went. 

""I'll be honest with you, Hawk. I think you're me telling the truth here. But I don't think you're telling me the whole truth. And I need to know the whole truth.""

This time, he let her sit. He kept his mind empty, or at least focused on what came next. The liquor store. The bottle. He'd keep the bottle sealed until he got back to Mercy's. Probably. But then the couch, the hot flow of liquor burning toward his belly. Eventually, the numbness, spreading like balm.

Finally, she blew out a breath and shook her head. Her face had turned soft again, disappointed in him. He was familiar with the expression. ""Go home, Mr. Riggins. You have my card.""

He did, he realized. It was still crumpled in his hand. For a brief, mad moment he considered handing it back to her, then he thought better and tucked it into his shirt pocket.

""I hope you're not planning any trips in the near future?""

He wasn't. Not that he wouldn't like to. But none of the five could leave the city. That was how the magic worked, the spell that had brought them together.

""I'll be around,"" he told her.

""Call me if you think of anything that might help. A woman is dead, Mr. Riggins. A woman you seem to have cared very much about. I'd think you'd welcome any chance to bring the man responsible to justice.""

Justice. For a dead man. Hawk wanted to laugh. Wanted to cry. 

Instead, he opened the door, picked his way past the tape and the uniforms still working the scene. Went out alone into the cold night.

Specifically: if you have a people/race who are spread out over a continent, and various countries, do you develop a language for them specifically, and name them according to that language, or do you develop a language for the regions, and name them according to the region they were born in, or the culture they came from? 
Do you do the same thing with animals and fauna that might occur across a wide area? 

I'm going to have to re-write vast chunks of my earlier stuff, so I might as well get this type of thing out of the way.

No elves or dwarves unless you've drastically altered the general preconception for them. For instance, my dwarves are seafarers, bound together in familial tribes which are in turn led as a whole by a king called a Shah.

As for unique races, here is an example:

The Sharpened are a race of humanoids descended from humans. Due to wild magic in the very make-up of my world, they evolved into something quite different. They stand about six and a half feet tall. Their blood is a yellowish-green while beneath the skin, and a darker green when spilt. Their skin is very pale and almost translucent, allowing those who see them to witness their veins pumping beneath the flesh. Their eyes are yellowed, but retain the same characteristics of their human ancestors. They don't grow hair at all (no eyebrows, no pubic hair, no eyelashes, nothing). They have an extremely high pain tolerance, which has led to a belief in their culture that pain is cleansing. While they do not seek pain masochistically, they do believe that pain is a way to purify sin. With this in mind, they often allow themselves to undergo painful and primitive surgeries, altering their appearance and turning themselves into terrifying parodies of humanity. They will cut out their cheeks, remove their lips, file their teeth to points, remove their ears. The most common surgery (and the thing that lends them their name) is the process of attaching sharpened metal spikes to their bones, often as a form of weapon. These spikes are usually a foot long, and sometimes pull out the skin of the Sharpened like hooks.

The people were at sea.

They had never been at sea this long.

They had fought a war. They had lost.

They had run.

“Go!” Pelu had said, a finger pointed to the sea wind.

They had readied their women and children. They had put them in large canoes, lashed together. They had taken their own.

They had pushed out to sea.

They did not look back.

There were stories of what they now did. There were stories of long ago. Pelu’s grandfather had told him his own grandfather’s story about such a voyage. Pelu’s grandfather had said that his grandfather had been but a boy when he was packed in a large canoe with many women and traveled the sea for days.

When they had landed, they built Pelu’s village.

Pelu’s village was now burnt. His grandfather’s shine was broken.

Pelu rose to the crest of a wave and whistled shrilly.

He did this every time he came to the rest of a wave.

Each surviving man did.

If a man heard fewer than ten whistles between his own, he rode towards the nearest whistle. This way they stayed together.

The first days, they had not done this. One night, one fewer man had come to rest with the caravan.

They were too few to lose any more.

In the very beginning, they had tried lashing canoe to canoe, but that had made them unsteady.

One canoe had been tipped. Its man was barely saved from water. His canoe had been lost, and he now rode with the women.

They were too few to lose any more.

Pelu rode alone. He saw no other people, and instead stared at the sea away from the sun. He stared, whistling whenever he felt his rise stop, and waited.

There were more women than men. More children. They fit ten or more to a canoe. Their canoes had long floats to one side, and could be lashed together by long rope. The women took turns at the paddle. Always three men watched the caravan. One at the top, one at the bottom, one rode near the middle in a women’s canoe. Three whistles, a pattern easily heard. 

The other men fished.

To do this they had to stray from sight of the long canoes. To do this, they had to stray from sight of each other.

This is why they whistled.

At night, they all came together. The men lashed their canoes to the long floats of the long canoes. Like this they slept.

One morning, the last long canoe and the three men’s canoes lashed to it were gone. The rope was frayed.

There were too few to lose any more.

Pelu always slept at the head of the caravan. It was he who lead the people. Every night he notched the wooden float with his knife.

There were six notches in the float this morning.

There had been three when one man had not come to sleep with the others.

There had been none when a man was forced to ride with the women.

They were learning.

They had learned from the women that seaweed contained water they could drink.

They had learned from the women that sharp whistles carried better than voices.

They had learned from the women that long canoes could be lashed together, but short canoes could not. They had also learned from experience. After that, they had listened to the women.

The women carried memories of the sea much older than the men. While the men had to train at hunting, at fishing, at war, the women told stories. Wives told daughters. Mothers told wives. Sisters told each other.

The women carried memories much older than all but a few men. Pelu had memories carried from his grandfather’s grandfather, and one carried from before, from before their village which was now burnt to the ground, from before the people had come to the island. Pelu had a memory from his grandfather’s grandfather’s father.

That memory had risen in him, that memory had spoken “Go!” through his lips.

Women carried many memories that could not be trusted. Their memories had no lineage. They did not think for themselves, women, but thought together. Pelu could never be sure if it was the woman in front of him who spoke, or her sister, or mother, or husband’s mother, or grandmother, or a woman whose shrine was no longer remembered.

But but the women’s memories were the only memories of sea without visible land, of voyage without destination, and must be abided.

They were too few to lose any more.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_ngr3t,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/ngr3t/sorry_to_make_my_first_post_my_own_writing/,

The basic premise of my story is the fall of a great kingdom as seen through the eyes of a few POV characters over their entire lives.  This submission constitutes the opening of the story. The first part is a fragment of a historical chronicle written centuries after the main story (my idea is to start each chapter with a fake historical text). This is followed by the prologue, serving as a framing story, set just decades after the fall of the kingdom. The next segment(not included) would be a flashback 80 years earlier, when the main protagonists are just children, and the narrative would gradually work back to the time of the prologue.

All comments are welcome. Feel free to be brutally honest.

""Little is known of the dark years between 860-880 of the Royal Era. The few surviving historical records of the era are fragmentary and difficult to interpret, and it is generally agreed by current historians that the unfinished epic poem The Song of The Eternal Warrior was actually written hundreds of years after the events in question. All the sources generally agree on the basic facts- that the monarchy of Berna collapsed in 854 after a peasant revolt, and revolutionaries installed a new government. The new government itself collapsed around 860 for unknown reasons, and the entire land descended into anarchy. At least three armies fought for control the once-great kingdom until 880, when in the Battle of Dragon Cliffs, one of these forces, under the command of a man known only as the Spider General, won a decisive victory over the combined forces of the other two armies. Upon his triumph, he was crowned Supreme Emperor and ruled all of Berna for the next thirty years, restoring order and peace to the war-ravaged land, and beginning the still-in-place Davinian Dynasty. Beyond this point, details are more the realm of myth and legends than history."" -From A History of the Bernese People, circa 1400 R.E.

Prologue 

Winter, 900 R.E.

The three travelers stared over the ruins in silence, while shivering in the harsh wind. Old skeletons and shattered relicts were scattered over the foggy remains. It once was the palace of a great kingdom, but it had been a merely graveyard for over twenty years now.

At the bottom of what was once a huge staircase sat a small mound of dirt. The entire area was littered with similar graves, but this one had a quiet dignity that suggested the deceased was buried with as much care and respect as was possible given the meager materials available. There was no marker on the grave except for the bottom half of a rusty sword, planted hilt up onto the far end. The first traveler bowed his head down in respect, and dropped a small ivory ornament onto the grave, by the hilt of the sword.

“Who was this person?” Asked the second traveler. But the first traveler said nothing, only led the two others back to their meager campsite a few miles away from the shadowy remains.

They gathered around the campfire eating the remains of their rations, savoring what little warmth and the light remained in the windy, cloudy night. A lone wolf howled in the distance. The first traveler stared quietly at the fire for a long time, never looking up. The fire brought out the dark shadows under his wrinkled eyes, eyes that had witnessed much over the years. In the flickers of the fire, he saw the faces of men and women who had long since passed away. Finally, he began to speak, hesitantly at first, but with increasing confidence as he went along.

“I’ll tell the story. This is a long one, and it will take many nights to complete it. But we have plenty time.” He laughed darkly at that, and then continued. “I will tell you of an age when the land was still alive, and heroes still roamed the face of the earth. I will tell you of the fall of the Great King, and of the three forces that marched to their doom at the Dragon Cliffs. I will tell of a wandering swordsman and his tragic friendship with the man would eventually become the treacherous Spider General... ”

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cold, damp air cut through Altair like a knife. Sharp breezes coming down from the mountains, their snow-capped peaks stark against the night sky, blew through the small canyon where he had set up his camp. He sat on the thick branches of a tree, his back pressed against the rough bark of the trunk. A small fire flickered beneath him, providing a meagre source of heat as the flames struggled to stay alive in the wind. Staring down into the light, Altair wished he could stir up a larger fire to keep warm, but then discarded the thought as quickly as it had appeared. He felt at home in the cold – his element was the ice. He felt as comfortable in a windstorm as the King on his throne. The only reason elected to make camp was because of the distance to the nearest town and the severity of the temperature. While he enjoyed the cold, he knew his limits, and he wasn’t going to push them. 


Leaves violently rustled as a strong gust flew down the canyon. Even the trunk of the tree, as thick around as a well, shuddered from the blast of wind. It was the worst windstorm since the turn of the year, but certainly not a rare event. In the past month, there had been six separate storms, each one stronger than the last. Altair only hoped that the winter had decided to go out with a bang; it was long past the time for warmer temperatures to come to Hadar. He would miss the crisp air of winter, but his job was much easier in the spring. 


Looking up from the fire, Altair eyed a smaller tree, a few meters away from the fire, and slightly to the left of his perch. It looked as if it had needles sticking out of its side. Waiting for the next gust to come, he flexed his fingers and relaxed, concentrating on the space around himself. With the silence of the mountains around him, he was quickly able to make the connection. The world near him shifted within his mind, and he could sense an energy coming from everything around him – the tree, the dirt, the fire, and even the mountains. It all crackled with magical energy. Most of the connections were dull, allowing him to only glimpse at the magic elements of the dirt and flames. However, the air, damp with fragments of water, pulsated with stronger energies. The most powerful force was distant, coming from the snow streaked across the mountains. It flared with magic, but was too far away for Altair to make use of it. He settled on the water in the air, focusing on it and pulling several drops out of the air to hover above his outstretched palm. Once he had enough, he let his own magic flow. It appeared as a small spark of silver light in his palm, which began to expand at a lethargic pace. Every particle of water the light touched reacted, freezing in an instant to form solid splinters of ice. The light also knitted the pieces together, flowing outwards with occasional sparks of magical energy. After a few moments the light shrunk back into nothingness, leaving Altair with a diamond-shaped shard of translucent blue ice. 


A few short seconds passed before the next blast of wind hit him. Gripping the ice, Altair frowned. It was taking him far too long to use his magic. While the wind was still blowing, he raised the shard above his head and threw it with precision, letting the wind take it. Twisting with the wind, the shard curved to the left and pierced the side of the smaller tree, standing straight next to the dozen other ice shards embedded in the trunk. Altair sighed when he looked at the number of shards he had created compared to the time he had been sitting here - too few for too long. At least he was still accurate. 


Craning his neck to look up at the night sky flecked with stars, Altair wondered why he was here. Of course he had to stay in the canyon until the storm passed, but he was thinking beyond his present situation. Working for an organization that he neither cared about nor completely agreed with, wandering from town to town with his few belongings and no desire to stay in one place, watching the people around him cower over a meaningless war, and letting his magic abilities fall into slump. No, not a slump, a gorge; an endless gorge that no one else was going to help him out of.


Altair flexed his fingers again as he stared at the stars. Holding his hand up in front of himself, he tried to reach out with his magic up past the tree, past the mountains, and past the sky. He could feel a faint pull at the edge of his magical vision when he looked at the stars. It should be impossible – if he couldn’t reach the snow on the mountains, he shouldn’t be able to reach the stars. But when he cleared his mind and reached....


*Pop!* The faint sound could have come from a burning ember in the fire below him, but Altair knew otherwise as he looked at the tiny ball of white light nestled in the palm of his hand. It gave off a small amount of heat, and a massive amount of magical energy, but had no practical use other than a little source of light. 


*Impressive and pretty, but it’s not going to be useful in combat.* Old words of lessons long past drifted through his memory. *It might mean something though. But not until you make it mean something.*


That piece of advice had always confused him. As a boy he marvelled over the idea of touching what he thought was a star, and decided to use it as a night light. As a teenager he tried to force philosophy on to his little ball of fire, because he was certain he couldn’t actually be summoning a star, so it must just be very hot flames. Now he was apathetic. Altair appreciated that no one else seemed to be able to do this, it still had no purpose for him. Maybe he could use it to impress girls. 


Rolling his eyes, Altair snuffed the light and stopped looking up. It was late in the night, or perhaps early the next morning, and he could do with some sleep. He needed to be rested for the journey tomorrow. As he tried to sleep, he contemplated his route. Could he make it all the way to the capital, or should he try for one of the smaller, but closer villages? Wherever he went, he had to find a job, preferably not for the Zaurak, and get paid. 


The night dragged on as Altair drifted in the foggy world halfway between waking and sleep. ",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_1jubnt,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1jubnt/critique_request_this_is_an_excerpt_from_my_story/,

&gt; Write a story that contains a dream sequence. Try and avoid the ""It was all a dream"" twist at the end, as it's entirely too predictable when the whole point of the prompt is to contain a dream sequence. 

**Submission guidelines**

* Maximum submission length: 1200 words.
* Submissions should be in a Google doc. (Please convert .doc or .docx files to proper Google documents!)
* You must submit to the [call for submissions thread](http://redd.it/1jp7id) on /r/shutupandwrite, as that is where the voting on submissions will take place. Obviously voting won't work if the submissions are scattered around different subreddits!
* Submissions are due by Midnight EST on Sunday August 11th.

**Voting guidelines**  
If we get more than six responses from this prompt, your votes will help us decide which ones get on the show. We're asking you to vote for the submissions you think would be the most interesting to hear. How you define ""interesting"" is up to you, of course :)

**Want to submit your own audio critique?**  
If you want to critique a piece that we have missed in the previous cycles (not the microfiction one, we'll be doing all of those!) feel free to submit your own audio critique in the style of the podcast as a reply to the submission.

Please remember that /r/shutupandwrite is not a text critique sub &amp;mdash; there are plenty of places with a monopoly on *that* already &amp;mdash; so standard text-only critiques are not allowed! (You could always PM the author on your own time, of course!)

Plus, if your audio critique is well-done and in the style of the critiquecast (unforgivingly honest) we will include it as a guest episode. How about that?

**Who we are: the Critiquecast**

The critiquecast is a side project of Shut Up &amp; Write, a podcast where amateur writers give unfair and unforgiving line-by-line reactions to submitted work. Most of the time, asking for critique from peers results in wimpy, noncommittal feedback. The critiquecast aims to be the opposite extreme: unbridled honesty from the perspective of a prospective reader with no reason to hold back.

You can find the critiquecast on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/shut-up-write-critiquecast/id643508248), subscribe to [our RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/critiquecast), or if you don't have any fancypants ways of listening to podcasts, you can listen to us from our website, [shutupandwrite.net](http://shutupandwrite.net). We upload new episodes every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

We're always looking for feedback (what would we be if we weren't, huh?) on how to make the show better without necessarily making it good, so leave a comment, a review, or flag down our cars on the freeway &amp;mdash; whatever it takes to send us a message.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,1375662272.0,,,True,t3_1jp8d6,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1jp8d6/xpost_from_rshutupandwritecritiquecast_call_for/,

""- How are you feeling? – Aithinne asked me with her honey voice.
- I... – I coughed up some more water. – I’ve been better.
- Get him into my tent. I need to examine him.
I was shocked. It had been some time since I was examined by a woman.
Two strong men appeared out of nowhere and grabbed me by the shoulders. I could walk on my own, but their grip was so tight there was no way I was getting out of it. Somehow I got the impression I was more of a prisoner than a patient. Aithinne’s tent was a yurt – a crown on top, supported by roof ribs which were bent down at the end where they met the lattice wall. Inside there was enough space for all the Elders to sit in a circle on their pillows – there was no table or chairs present, as the tribes of Rah’adje were nomads and didn’t carry such luxuries around. Around the yurt, servants were standing ready to obey their Elder’s commands.
The men dropped me on one of the pillows and went outside. Aithinne came in and stood in front of me. She was looking at me, but this time there was no concern in her eyes – what I saw was concealed anger. Suddenly I felt like a naughty child who was about to get a lecture from his mom.""

Anyway, I finished the story today, at 141 000 words. Feels great, apart from half of it probably being crap. Now on to editing and getting beta readers!

I'm absolutely fascinated with elves, dragons, magic etc. 
I've recently started actually writing my series after spending the last 6 years off and on crafting the universe, which consists of men, elves, and two original races (I hope) that I have crafted. So here's my dilemma: dwarves. I like dwarves, but I don't have a place for them in my universe except as a flimsy plot device, so I've been toying with not having them in at all. And I guess I'm having this feeling that since I have all the other traditional fantasy aspects, I feel odd about leaving dwarves out. 

TL;DR: with elves, magic, dragons, etc. Should I be worried about excluding dwarves simply because they're expected in a fantasy universe.",,False,,t5_2t4ad,False,,,True,t3_1iyle1,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1iyle1/do_some_fantasy_mainstaysinstitutions_beget_others/,
