[First update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xsrgg/udate_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/)

[Today's Update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xvsvy/update_2_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/)

----------------------

**Summary of the Original Post**

The OP, a 26 year-old girl, writes to /r/relationships asking whether she ""shit-tested"" her boyfriend when she jokingly asked him via text if she could watch two of her friends fuck while he was out of town. When he had reluctantly responded that she could she responded by chewing him out, accusing him of lying about his feelings, and then getting angry because he wasn't really enthused about her fake proposal. 

The response was [overwhelmingly against the OP](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xpz2j/did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5okjzl), with famed /r/relationships commenter /u/silversuns asking the OP [""What the fuck is wrong with you?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xpz2j/did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5oo6vu)

Instead of accepting blame for her poor decision, the OP lashes out and complains about her boyfriend, saying gems such as [""But why should I give a shit about him when he doesn't give a shit about him?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xpz2j/did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5osknl) and revealing that she's a [26 year-old divorcee](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xpz2j/did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5onxea). In response, /u/possiblyhysterical tears OP a new one by telling her that her first divorce [""is not surprising at all considering your responses here."" ](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xpz2j/did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5oo7f4)

OP also asserts that [her boyfriend won't have the spine to break up with her over this mistake](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xpz2j/did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5oqjg1).

**Which brings us to the first update...**

Now the real drama juice starts flowing!

OP says that she apologized to her boyfriend for the shit test, but he decided to break up with her anyways and is now convinced that she was in a MFF threesome with her friends. He packed his shit, she started crying, and he responded by slapping and punching himself in the face until his eyes were swollen. Wat?

OP goes on to write about her boyfriend's relationship history in detail and includes an anecdote about finding an incest play that he had written about himself getting molested. 

The commentors again rip on OP, with /u/Torn_blue telling OP: [""You fucked Dave... Admit it""](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xsrgg/udate_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5pccmh). OP attempts to defend herself by calling her imminently ex-boyfriend her [""it's-complicated""](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xsrgg/udate_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5pjddl), to which /u/eliasqfuntybunt exclaims ""Jesus fucktits"".

/u/mingau123 joins in the dog pile by sympathizing with OP's self-harming boyfriend[and telling OP that she sucks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xsrgg/udate_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5pbz49)

Meanwhile, /u/WealthyIndustrialist [laughs at the irony](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xsrgg/udate_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5pi91o) that OP's desire for her boyfriend to grow a backbone and stand up to her has finally born fruit. He writes:

&gt;Oops, mission accomplished. You finally got him to show some backbone and be assertive. All you had to do was get him to really, really hate you.

Finally, /r/relationships admin /u/laryrose steps in to give OP advice, encouraging [her to stay safe and getting heavily downvoted for it](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xsrgg/udate_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5p8w0a). /u/KoNP responds that OP could probably benefit from a good beating because it [""might make her think twice next time she wants to emotionally fuck someone over.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xsrgg/udate_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5pds59) Ouch.

A minor argument breaks out in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xsrgg/udate_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5pedv3) when /u/Lady_Tentacles suggests that OP's boyfriend might be crazy, as redditors come out of the woodwork to defend his  violent reaction to OP's stunt.

**Now for the latest post**

OP lets everyone know that the boyfriend is due to collect his things today and that her female friend has attempted to let him know that nothing really did happen between the three of them while he was away. OP also expresses a desire to try and win her boyfriend back because ""he's been the best thing that's happened to me in a long, long time,"" then gives us yet another buttery gem:
&gt;I hate that I ruined our relationship, and I hate that he's kept this horrible side of his personality hidden from me all this time.

/r/relationships is a bit gentler this time around, but /u/Congzilla 's cold [""Just leave him the fuck alone.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xvsvy/update_2_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5q0qoz) still took the top spot upvotes-wise.

Elsewhere in the thread, /u/behindtheaegis provides his own entertaining sideshow by projecting all over OP's boyfriend. He describes OP's boyfriend as a ""misogynist"" who has been [""force-fed man-child bullshit from his lonely friends on 4chan.org/r9k""](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xvsvy/update_2_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5q0jl7), only to later admit that [he goes on r9k, too](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xvsvy/update_2_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5q16jh).

In a fit of probable genius, /u/mouth55 [accuses the OP](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xvsvy/update_2_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5q2s24) of being a troll due to similarities between her writing style and that of an older poster who also had an SO with a secret incest screenplay. *Full disclosure: I commented here and agreed with him because I had had the same thought.* However, [OP denies the link](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/xvsvy/update_2_did_i_just_shittest_my_boyfriend/c5q0jtu). 

**And so ends the tale of a probable troll, who got /r/relationships flipped and turned upside down...**

    “Gentlemen! You can't fight in here. This is the Dramaroom!”
    ~ Anon.

#### Dramatis personæ:

* */u/karmanaut* — Antagonist. Prominent redditor. Current top-mod of r/IAmA.
* */u/Shitty_Watercolour* — Foil. A novelty account who paints watercolours frequently.
* *The Tremendous Horde Of Redditors* — Protagonist. Unfettered champions of free-speech and democracy. Driven by baffling credulity, and on a noble quest for moderator-blood.

#### Act 1. Wherein karmanaut profits from the death and rebirth of IAmA

*Aug, 2011*: /u/32bites, creator and then top-mod of r/IAmA, announces that his creation has been ruined at the hands of The Tremendous Horde, and that he will be [closing the subreddit immediately](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ju5cf/goodbye_iama_it_was_fun_while_it_lasted/). He cites a lack of focus; r/IAmA has become a domain of triviality and fakery. 

The Horde is enraged, and a consensus emerges that IAmA has out-grown its creator, and that it should be given new life. Andrewsmith1986 [gets in contact with 32bites](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/juj7n/i_just_talked_to_the_iama_mod_32bites_on_the_phone/), who [agrees to hand control of the subreddit over to karmanaut](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/just3/i_am_that_asshole_all_of_you_hate_so_much_32bites/). Karmanaut swears a blood-oath to uphold strict submission guidelines for the good of mankind. Anonymous leaves an [astute premonition](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/just3/i_am_that_asshole_all_of_you_hate_so_much_32bites/c2fan1v?context=1).

&gt; *sockpuppet-sideplot*: A ""[turfwar](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uifof/recap_karmanaut_and_riama/c4vtqt3)"" breaks out involving [/u/bechus and /u/Azured](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/cl81x/a_violation_of_trust_and_community_values/c0td6ln), with /u/flossdaily caught in the crossfire. Bechus is exposed as being one of karmanaut's accounts. /u/earlyworm_ is also accused, but deletes his account before anything is confirmed. This is a source of great confusion, as it was previously thought that karmanaut was [one account controlled by several people](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/d5on3), rather than several accounts controlled by one person.

#### Act 2. “Karmagate” and The Karmanaut Administration.

*Feb, 2012*. True to his oath, karmanaut removes any submissions that do not meet the criteria of notoriety or interest. /r/CasualIAmA is created in order to siphon the unwanted traffic, but jimmies are nonetheless rustled. 

In what became known as “Karmagate”, an IAmA by pimpmod, /u/ViolentAcrez, is [removed by karmanaut](http://www.reddit.com/r/violentacrez/comments/pvadf/well_well_well_look_what_we_have_here/). In the fall-out, karmanaut is revealed to be /u/probablyhittingonyou (*see sockpuppet-sideplot*). Sushileaks transcripts [reveal tensions among the IAmA moderators](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/px6rz/sushisushisushi_found_a_second_chat_log_in_this/). Andrewsmith1986 is removed as mod of IAmA, and [makes public his wish that karmanaut step down](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/pxtn8/andrewsmith1986_here_ive_been_getting_some_front/). ToR discuss the [implications of leaks, and of having great power in the hands of few](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/pwle1/no_information_leaves_this_room_is_reddit_in/) ([2](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/og1l1/moderator_statistics_round_2_this_time_down_to/)). 

*Edit: [andrewsmith1986 provides his account of the Karmanaut Administration](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uifof/recap_karmanaut_and_riama/c4vwkko) up to this point.*

Meanwhile, /u/Shitty_Watercolour begins posting shitty watercolours everywhere.

*Apr, 2012*. Undaunted by Karmagate, karmanaut removes an IAmA by Bad Luck Brian, of image-macro fame. His [removal comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s5guk/iam_bad_luck_brian_ama/c4b8m3u) receives record-breaking downvotes. The Horde [regroups in r/AdviceAnimals](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/t0xwa/to_karmanaut_the_moderator_that_killed_the_bad/), having aquired the [taste for blood](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/t0xwa/to_karmanaut_the_moderator_that_killed_the_bad/c4iodvx). It is [quietly revealed](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/tdl1a/iam_bad_luck_brian_ama/c4lpt8l?context=2) that the IAmA was a hoax.

&gt; *sockpuppet-sideplot*: At the height of Karmagate, [more leaked transcripts](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/pwrtf/the_karmanaut_is_phoy_pastebin_file_now_with_100/) expose /u/probablyhittingonyou as another of karmanaut's accounts. The bechus/flossdaily affair is re-ignited, and Karmanaut [loses the support](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/q1fcz/all_of_karmanauts_accounts_that_were_currently/) of several prominent users. Karmanaut responds by [interviewing himself in r/SubredditDrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/pwv4l/karmanaut_here_ive_been_getting_some_front_page/). CowzGoezMoo uses sockpuppets to spray [inane sockpuppet longtext](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/tej5o/to_karmanaut_the_riama_moderator_who_deleted_bad/c4m51r3) everywhere. POLITE_ALL_CAPS_GUY and andrewsmith1986 [pretend to be the same person](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/r1jys/polite_allcaps_guy_comes_out_as_andrewsmith1986/), but [aren't](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/r1rnk/eli5_why_did_the_hivemind_just_lose_its_shit/).  

#### Act 3. Wherein drama occurs which has been elaborated upon elsewhere to great extent.

*June, 2012*. Karmanaut [bans Shitty_Watercolour from commenting in IAmA](http://imgur.com/a/dTxUS), and leaves implied accusations that S_W is attempting to profit from his commenting. 

The feckless novelty cum People's Champion [responds to his fans](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ugzsl/is_there_anything_an_ordinary_reddit_user_can_do/c4vbvpc). The Horde explodes everywhere, leaving a putrid mess of vacuous asininity throughout SubredditDrama. Discussion threads: [one](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ueu4j/karmanaut_is_at_it_again_shitty_watercolour/), [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uh68e/shitty_watercolour_vs_karmanaut_round_2_drama/), and [three](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uhbx7/shitty_watercolour_vs_karmanaut_round_3_s_w/).

Drunken_Economist [reverses the ban](http://www.reddit.com/r/Shitty_Watercolour/comments/uh9n3/you_have_been_unbanned_from_iama/c4vczzo) after bearing many [capricious accusations of being karmanaut](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uhdbg/bi0ware_cites_proof_that_karmanaut_is_drunken/) (he isn't: [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Shitty_Watercolour/comments/uh9n3/you_have_been_unbanned_from_iama/c4vdmg4?context=3), [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uhdbg/bi0ware_cites_proof_that_karmanaut_is_drunken/c4vk14d).) Meanwhile, redditors in IAmA [appeal for a changing of the guard](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ui8n6/mods_why_is_it_okay_for_celebrities_to_spam_iama/). Their thread is [removed](http://www.reddit.com/r/ModerationLog/comments/uiism/riama_removed_mods_why_is_it_okay_for_celebrities/), and then un-removed shortly after.

Karmanaut lies low...
 
&gt; *sockpuppet-sideplot*: Any deviation from moderator-blood-lust is now recognised by The Horde as an admission of guilt and collusion. Karmanaut's confirmed sockpuppets now include [Drunken_Economist](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uh68e/shitty_watercolour_vs_karmanaut_round_2_drama/c4vchb3), [CitationGiven, Mr.OhHai, ThePieOfSauron](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uh68e/shitty_watercolour_vs_karmanaut_round_2_drama/c4vk98u), [ANNOYING_ALLCAPS_ASS](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/sjt0e/video_of_a_6_yr_old_boy_performing_cunnilingus/c4esyc0), [redditnoir](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ugzsl/is_there_anything_an_ordinary_reddit_user_can_do/c4vbvpc), [BritishHobo](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uh68e/shitty_watercolour_vs_karmanaut_round_2_drama/c4vd15u), [bekeleven](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/uh9qa/butthurt_karmanaut/c4vecdo), [Trapped_In_Reddit, epic_comebacks](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/tjhh9/trapped_in_reddit_gets_attacked_by_frustrated_user/c4n84sy), [iaminlovewithjesus](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uifof/recap_karmanaut_and_riama/c4vwkko), [khnumhotep](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uifof/recap_karmanaut_and_riama/c4voibj), and [Shitty](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uh68e/shitty_watercolour_vs_karmanaut_round_2_drama/c4vce96)_[Watercolour](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ugzsl/is_there_anything_an_ordinary_reddit_user_can_do/c4vbypn) (who [is Quentin Blake](http://www.reddit.com/r/Shitty_Watercolour/comments/u2xwk/this_is_just_one_day_one_day/)). In a surprise twist, karmanaut is [literally Hitler](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/uifof/recap_karmanaut_and_riama/c4vp6uc).

&gt; *Edit: Apparently the sarcasm was lost on some folks. To be clear, there is no good evidence that any of the people listed here are karmanaut.*


#### Act 4. The Dénouement.

~~User /u/sisterofblackvisions has [updated us](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/s59ju/from_the_sister_of_black_visions_who_committed/) with the gruesome tale of his death.

**UPDATE 2** Alright, coming back with over 1,000 orangereds and noticing this post is the top post in SRD history, it's my responsibility to clear some things up. This story is starting to look fishy. Most of the details given by sisterofblackvisions seem to match up with the news story and police ""report"", except for some glaring errors such as the date of the event and the name of the victim. SRS appears to be at most tenuously linked to the specific trolls involved. AlyoshaV's deleted comment was not really encouragement for the event, and for calling him/her out, I apologize.

I want to go on the record and state that, regardless of the veracity of the real-world event, what transpired in that thread one month ago was despicable, and whoever thought it would be a good idea to troll a guy who posted about his suicidal intentions are the lowest of the low. That doesn't excuse my lack of skepticism and fact-checking.

I've had to deal with suicide in my family before, and seeing this story unfold stirred up emotions I thought I had sorted out, and I saw red. My intentions were to call out the trolls and see justice for their actions, and while I've partially succeeded, it appears that I stirred up an SRS witchhunt of epic proportions. I don't really have strong feelings for or against SRS, but they don't deserve to be associated with this story.

I'm not going to be reporting drama here anymore. Thanks for those who are showing support and denouncing Internet bullying.

HuffPo displays its journalistic prowess by jumping on the bandwagon and accusing the same person. Reddits internet vigilantes undergo a spontaneous self-congratulatory mass-ejaculation:

The main thing everyone is wondering is 'why?' and to avoid any misinformation, I thought I would tell everyone the real reason why. The short version is this:

**tl;dr: VA was doxxed in real life and Adrian Chen was going to run an article on him**

The long version is this. A few days ago, I asked VA to add me as a moderator to /r/incest. He did and then replied that when I added him as a Moderator on /r/CreepShots, I may have 'sealed his fate' because Adrian Chen 'decided to hunt him down' and was going to print his real name and picture in an article.

I asked him how could anyone have his real picture, considering he is very tight with personal information. He speculated that it was possible the Admins, /u/chromakode and possibly even /u/spez may have given it to Chen.

[Screenshot 1 of PM Conversation](http://i.imgur.com/0UoxR.png)

He was obviously quite worried about it and, as some of you know, SRS has a very tight association with Gawker Media (a few stuff on SRS appears on the website Jezebel) and the possible harm it could do to his real life:

[Screenshot 2](http://i.imgur.com/q1gvo.png)

I then asked if demodding him from /r/Creepshots would stop the article being published:

[Screenshot 3](http://i.imgur.com/L7n0s.png)

At that point, 5 days ago, VA said he had offered to delete his account but Gawker said 'no', so I am not sure what has changed. I hope they will leave him alone though.

So that is the real story behind Violentacrez deleting his account.

Edit: Here is further proof that Adrian Chen was contacting other Redditors for information about VA:

[Screenshot 4 with /u/Saydrah](http://i.imgur.com/UqRA8.png) 

**Some additional information about Adrian Chen:**

As some people are pointing out, Adrian Chen can be considered to be a scummy journalist who really, really hates Reddit and last year he 'did a /u/WarPhalange'. Where WarPhalange pretended to have cancer to prove a point to Reddit, Adrian Chen, seemingly, pretended he was going to end his life.

Over a year ago, around March 2011, there was this famous IAmA post by /u/lucidending, who said he was ending his life because of illness, and which gained Reddit a lot of attention on other mainstream news sites:

[51 Hours to Live](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/fy6yz/51_hours_left_to_live/)

The truth of the story, and identity of lucidending, is still up for debate. However, shortly afterwards, Adrian Chen claimed to be lucidending himself [Screenshot of his Tweet](http://i.imgur.com/SZqRD.png). All to prove some kind of point about Reddit and gullibility and blah, blah, blah...

When Reddit, and other forums, got angry, [he rapidly backtracked and denied it was him](http://gawker.com/5780681/why-the-internet-thinks-i-faked-having-cancer-on-a-message-board) and also posted this picture of himself that was intended to mock Reddit: http://i.imgur.com/bQlgI.jpg",,False,self,t5_2ss5b,1349861052.0,,,True,t3_118qdg,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/118qdg/the_real_reason_why_violentacrez_deleted_his/,

**Chapter 4: ""Noah is a bastard""**

Evidently a week after the other posts, /u/NoahsArcRises (NAR for short) finally has ""consummated things"" with Emma. He [asks /r/askagirl whether any of them have been mistresses before](http://www.reddit.com/r/askagirl/comments/zcw9o/anyone_here_been_a_mistressother_woman/), and if so, did they eventually expect their men to leave their wives. He explains that he can't leave his wife, and asks that women who have a problem with his affair to ""please just avoid responding.""

**The Comments**

/u/Zara02 has the top comment, simply responding

&gt;Asshole. Just my 2c.

to which NAR quotes the part of the OP requesting that dissenters keep quiet. /u/sunnydaisy responds with a link to the First Amendment and Zara02  explains that she has a ""moral problem with it.""

/u/DaisyLayz tells OP that of course she would expect him to leave his wife eventually, but frankly tells him

&gt;This is a really dumb idea though. And I mean that in the most respectful way possible. It's so so dumb and it'll probably be something you regret for a long time. Good luck and I hope it all works out.

/u/HillTopTerrace also responds to the OP, telling NAR that he is ""a disgrace to marriage"" if his marriage is not open and warning him that all affairs eventually come to light. NAR tries to defend himself, saying

&gt;its quite complicated and not as simple as, ""Noah is a bastard"".

&gt;I don't want this to go on for years. I realize its not sustainable. How long do you think we can make it work for before someone gets hurt or she expects more? I've been really good to her so far and I think she is really into me. 

HillTopTerrace continues to humor NAR, this time warning him that his wife is very likely to get ""women's intuition"" about what's going on and will likely bust him soon. He tries to counter that he's covered himself by changing Emma's name in his phone to a man's name and turning off push notifications for texts. HillTop tells him that her ex did similar things, but that she snooped and discovered the truth anyways and encourages him to at least be safe and use condoms. Finally HillTop urges NAR to tell Emma about his wife so that she knows not to expect more, but he fatefully counters: 

&gt;I think I will talk to her about my wife... in time. Its literally only been a week. We've had sex once and hooked up one other time. Not soon enough to start talk about my wife. I'm thinking if at the end of the month we are still at it I'll bring up my wife and how this can't last. No need to screw up the new relationship energy now. 

-----------------------------------------

**Chapter 5: ""Its been a lot of fun.""**

Just 2 days later, NAR [posts essentially the same question again](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/zhhgr/any_women_here_been_with_a_married_guy_how_did/), this time in r/AskWomen. In his OP, he reveals that he and Emma have now had sex twice, and that ""it's been a lot of fun."" He boasts that /r/adultery has given him good advice on how not to get caught, and then reiterates that he doesn't want to leave or divorce his wife. As expected, he is heavily downvoted at 0 pts (2+:10-). 

**The Comments**

This time, the top comment is actually by a mistress, /u/liliboo, who recounts her time as a mistress to a man who went through a ""fake marriage"" with her. As for OP's advice, she writes:

&gt;My advice to you should probably be to go fuck yourself, but you already see yourself as the victim in this situation, so why bother?

&gt;""its an extremely complex situation. Please don't lecture me.""

&gt;Morality is only complex to immoral people, just like addition is complex for three-year-olds.

&gt;(Oh and I do have some practical advice that could save you a lot of money, heartache, and so on, but you don't deserve it.)

/u/dratthecookies also gives OP advice, telling him in another prophetic bout to at the very least respect Emma, since

&gt;The most problems I've seen (outside of the obvious) came from the guy trying to treat the woman like a piece of crap so she wouldn't like him too much. Or trying so hard not to ""hurt her feelings"" that he ended up over thinking it and sabotaged the relationship. If you both know what you're about and handle it maturely (20 y/o? ehhh) it can be fun.

---------------------------------------------

**Chapter 6: ""She loves me after 3 weeks. How do I end this?""**

A little over 2 weeks later, NAR appears again. Clearly things have taken a turn for the worse since his last post, as he is [now asking r/relationships how to get out of his affair](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10es9r/she_loves_me_after_3_weeks_how_do_i_end_this_33m/) now that Emma is professing feelings of love. 

In his post, he again re-hashes the he can't leave his wife or let another man raise his 3 kids, but has clearly changed his attitude about his marriage, which he has previously written off as hopeless,  stating

&gt;I think the marriage is fixable and once I end the affair I will focus on making it up to her. 

He worriedly notes that Emma could ""really... screw me over by going to my wife"" and saying the he doesn't want to hurt her feelings because she's ""a wonderful person who I do have feelings for.""

**The Comments**

The top comment is by /u/stephiej17, who if you remember previously, tried to defend OP before he pursued things with Emma. She tells him to simply

&gt;Introduce her to your wife.

OP humorlessly responds that he know she's joking but that he can't tell his wife and that he needs ""to make this go away without my wife learning anything.""

/u/BaconBuddy, who was also in OP's original thread, appears again, this time to laugh

&gt;Ha! When you mess around with a chick who would mess around with a married man, there is very little chance you'll come out of this looking like anything but a guy shitting all over his wife and kids.

NAR gets upset again, writing that he 

&gt;thought this was on advice forum. Not just a place for people to laugh at others misfortune. I fucked up. Okay. I know that now. 

BaconBuddy has no sympathy for him, though, and notes that it was his fault for getting into this nasty mess but that it was almost comical that he wanted pity for it. NAR again complains that no one is giving him useful advice, and BaconBuddy encourages him to at least get an STD test, which NAR agrees to, but then tells him to stop being a ""prick"" and to tell his wife.

It is here where NAR says that he plans on blaming his wife finding out for ending their affair, and he asks BaconBuddy for input. Unfortunately, the rest of this thread is deleted, so we shall never know what BB thought, but that plan will be relevant in the next chapter.

Back in the thread where NAR was complaining about advice, /u/user31415926535 bluntly points out that the advice they've been giving to confess is useful, but NAR stubbornly writes

&gt;Yes, because I don't want to be fucking divorced. 

As NAR's house of cards collapses around him and he begs for ""better"" advice, stephiej17 asks him to reflect on his actions and wonders how he could do such terrible things to a family he claimed to love. He pitifully cries

&gt;I do feel bad. Its why I'm ending it. Do you honestly think I don't feel guilty? I love my wife. I love my kids. I love my family. I fucked up. I was selfish and greedy and weak. I'm going to make it up to my wife. Anything she wants she is going to get. I'm going to be the best husband I possibly could be.

stephiej17 tells him to expect Emma to tell his wife and asks if he did it to get the divorce that he wife threatened him with, and he denies it, claiming it happened because he was 

&gt;disappointed in our marriage, tired of being accused, and Emma was unbelievably sexy and I didn't have restraint. I don't really want a divorce. I would honestly be so sad if we ended up divorced. My wife is the person I want to grow old with and the mother of my children. I'm sorry I betrayed her and it won't happen again. 

As he blubbers like a child caught with his hand in the cookie jar, stephiej17 shows him some compassion, encouraging him to go to marriage counseling and again telling him to at least be honest with his wife. He latches onto the idea of marriage counseling and later in the thread says he's going to finally tell Emma off. user31415926535 celebrates this and asks him how it went, and NAR simply replies

&gt;It didn't go well. I don't know what I've got myself into. 

Elsewhere in the thread, OP gets called a [""narcissist and a selfish asshole""](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10es9r/she_loves_me_after_3_weeks_how_do_i_end_this_33m/c6d2j09) and again refuses to confess, and OP actually claims that his marriage [""was a little healthier than most with the cheating""](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10es9r/she_loves_me_after_3_weeks_how_do_i_end_this_33m/c6cunpb). 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter 7: ""I feel like the unluckiest cheater in the world""**

NAR posted his final and latest update just last night, [in another heavily downvoted thread in r/relationships.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10x9l7/update_she_loves_me_after_3_weeks_how_do_i_end/)

Here, he reveals what has happened in the days between his last post and this one. Due to the high popcorn and facepalm value of this post, I have copied and posted it below in full:

&gt;I debated posting an update or not since the reception I've had on this sub has been icy, at best. But I've already posted my story here so I may as well keep at it. Yes, I'm cheating so there is that. I understand a lot of people don't support that but just realize its very complicated and I am trying to put an end to this.

&gt;I feel like the unluckiest cheater in the world. Everything that can go wrong, has gone wrong. Every cliché has basically happened to me. I just wanted to live a little and have that quick affair and get back to my wife and marriage.

&gt;Asked for advice about a week or so ago. I tried to break up with Emma. I told her my wife was getting suspicious and we both deserved better. I told her she was an awesome girl and deserved to have someone all for herself. Her response. I'll wait for you. I love you more than I know possible.... Its not even been a month of us being ""together"".

&gt;I ended things with her and she kept texting me and asking me to talk to her. I met up with her on Friday to have a closure type deal. I'm a horny idiot. I banged her the back of my Jeep. Which sent the wrong, wrong message. I told her we can't do this anymore and didn't talk to her Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, or Tues. Yesterday she begs me to talk to her so I go to her place. We end up talking way longer than we should and some things go down.

&gt;I just wish she would leave me alone. She is clingy and needy and honestly pretty fucking crazy. Not what I signed up for. I'm like dying under the stress and drama. I have a hormonal, pregnant wife and two young kids. I don't need this shit And the guilt is starting to get at me. I don't know what I am going to do. I honestly do not even want to continue the affair at this point. I'm not sure what my next move is. Just feel like venting right now. 

**The Comments**

/u/justicefails holds the top spot, merely noting that NAR should expect no sympathy because he is a cheater. NAR responds, saying 

&gt;I'm asking for sympathy for getting too far into this. I obviously own the decision to cheat. It was my choice.

&gt;My wife may or may not deserve better. I don't automatically the worst husband ever because I cheated one time. She doesn't become a martyr because of my actions. You know? She still has her faults. I should not have cheated on her though.

/u/TacoCatastrophe rhetorically asks OP what is wrong with him, chides him for getting with a 20 year-old ""child,"" and urges him to ""be a man. Delete her number."" NAR tries to defend his actions, claiming that he is leaving her alone but that she keeps bothering him, but /u/lemonadegame simply quotes the line in NAR's OP  about fucking Emma in his Jeep and asks ""WTF dude"".

Elsewhere in the thread, where the /r/relationships community again urges OP to confess, he wistfully wonders

&gt;Perhaps through some miracle this blows over?

He also admits to doing the exact opposite of the given advice in the last thread, sheepishly adding

&gt;Its difficult in the moment because Emma is fucking attractive as hell and I'm an indecisive, softie. I really struggle to be a dick when she seems hurt or sad. 

Elsewhere, /u/Corporal_Rodney quotes OP's line about his meeting with Emma being completely platonic and laughing, to which OP says that it was ""very different"" between then and when an attractive girl was offering herself to him. /u/j00jy calls him out on this by quoting his previous confession of just wanting to ""live a little and have that quick affair"" and demanding that he own up to his bad intentions from the start.

I've been getting a flood of PMs asking me to update, but I had been holding off until Noah finally confessed his affair to his wife. Well, it's finally happened folks, and so here's part 3 to ""A Cheater's Tale."" 

----------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter 8: “I'm a piece of shit.”**

We last heard from Noah/NAR (33, married) in his [Oct. 4th update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10x9l7/update_she_loves_me_after_3_weeks_how_do_i_end/) to /r/relationships, where he complained that Emma, his 20 year-old mistress, wouldn’t stop contacting him after he tried to break up with her and he yet again “banged her in [his] jeep.”

For several more weeks Noah went about as he always had: [complaining about his wife](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11g4vc/married_women_of_reddit_how_is_your_sex_life/c6m6yw0?context=3) and claiming that [he didn’t want to leave his wife](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11gikc/i_see_a_lot_of_stuff_on_reddit_that_talks_about/c6mbbqk), saying:

&gt;I do not want to have sex with random women, I want to have amazing sex with my wife and mother of my children. 

He also went on to call Emma “fucking crazy” for [giving him head on their first “date”](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/11h9ns/what_do_you_think_when_a_girl_you_just_met_gives/c6mgfaz?context=3).

Interspersed with his newfound sage anti-cheating advice, NAR also made [plenty](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/11hbp0/dat_album_now_with_gender_tag_p_f/c6mkaby) [of](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/11hgcd/decided_to_post_for_the_first_time_while_my/c6mk4fd) [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/11hmkl/little_shorts_f/c6mkgas) on Gonewild, whilst complaining that [Emma wouldn’t stop messaging him](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/11hmkl/little_shorts_f/c6mkgas) after their “break up.” As usual, he placed all of the blame for his affair on his wife, his horniness, and Emma’s craziness. He even admits:

&gt;I do get some sort of high off knowing she wants me and maybe I'm afraid to just abandon that. This has honestly been one of the most challenging ordeals of my life. 

He goes on to express hope that he can be friends with Emma, acknowledges that he’s “a piece of shit,” but tries to qualify it with the fact that he’s “only human and... a sinner.” Again, interspersed with his replies are a [bunch](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/11in0m/this_is_just_who_i_am_f/c6mu56e) of [random](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/11htp8/fuck/c6mlqc1?context=3) come-ons to Gonewild girls. 

On October 15, he posts his [second update](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11j1q9/update_2_she_loves_me_after_3_weeks_how_do_i_end/) on his Emma situation to /r/relationships, though nothing new had really conspired since the last one.  As you can probably guess, he again blames his pregnant wife’s lacking sex drive on his affair, saying: 

&gt;If my wife and I were suddenly rocking in the bedroom then what I get from Emma isn't needed. If the sexual aspects were fixed and my wife was more emotionally affectionate, no way I would keep seeing Emma. My life would be perfect then and it would not be worth the risk. 


The next day, October 16, [NAR comments on his r/relationships post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11j1q9/update_2_she_loves_me_after_3_weeks_how_do_i_end/c6n3t1e), confessing:

&gt;I fucked up. I talked to Emma again...

&gt;Not for a long time but still too long. I just asked her how she was feeling and we caught up. I asked her if she really fucked someone else and she admitted she didn't , which was a relief. She asked me why I wasn't responding and I told her I said I wasn't going to but that I was reading them and that I wanted to talk to her. She asked me to see her tomorrow and I hemmed and hawed but I'm probably going to go. 

&gt;I'm not strong enough to end this. I think I need it. I need her. It doesn't mean I don't love my wife or I don't care about my wife or my family. Its just on the side. It doesn't take anything away from them...

Predictably, he admits that he’s “made [his] peace with what is going on” and that he’s still going to pursue Emma. Just like that, he’s also decided that he’s [“been overthinking this” ](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11j1q9/update_2_she_loves_me_after_3_weeks_how_do_i_end/c6n5po9) for  getting freaked out at Emma’s “I love you.” He also straight up [propositions a GW girl](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild/comments/11kf7m/wanna_fuck/c6nbsly?context=3) to fuck if she’s “ever in the midwest.” Ew.

He then makes his last comment in his relationships post, saying

&gt;Right now I don't want to think about my marriage or what could potentially go wrong with Emma. I just want to live. I want to have fun and fuck the very willing partner I have. We'll just take it day by day. This isn't fair or perfect but its far from the worst thing in the world. 

Noah goes on to flip flop in other subreddits between being [afraid of being caught](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/11jkeh/being_a_sex_positive_person_im_disgusted_by/c6ngy99) and [hating the idea of being just Emma’s fetish](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/11n969/i_think_i_have_a_fetish_for_having_sex_with/c6o2v6q).  He also (*brace for it*) [**confesses to fucking Emma in his daughter’s bedroom**](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/11mtr7/where_have_you_had_slightly_to_insanely/c6o3cor).

A week later, he [complains to r/sex that he and Emma “never get to have sex in a bed”](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1217zt/my_girlfriend_and_i_never_get_to_have_sex_in_a/). Once people realize that he’s married, [it goes about the way you’d expect it to](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1217zt/my_girlfriend_and_i_never_get_to_have_sex_in_a/c6rgqvh). 

Finally, Noah makes his [final update to /r/relationships](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/121csy/last_update_she_loves_me_after_3_weeks_how_do_i/) on October 25, still saying that he’s  “[fallen] back into the affair,"" proving himself to be the same old flip flopping, spineless bastard that he’s appeared to be throughout this whole saga.

By October 29, NAR is [back in /r/adultery, asking for advice about emotional affairs](http://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/127okb/an_emotional_affair/) and any suggested “exit strateg[ies]”.  He brags about how the affair “made [him] feel so ALIVE” and still confesses fears of being caught. The commenters berate him for talking about his affair all over Reddit and urge him to accept the inevitable fact that his wife will be hurt by his actions.

On November 3rd, NAR solicits [r/relationships for advice again](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12l22m/is_it_okay_for_one_person_to_be_dominant_33m_20f/), this time asking if it was okay that he dominated Emma (the post has since been removed, though). Here, Noah [admits that he’s planning on deleting](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12l22m/is_it_okay_for_one_person_to_be_dominant_33m_20f/c6w38uc) this account since no one wants to help him knowing his history, and thinks that his GW comments are harmless. He also says he’s going to cut off the affair before his child is born.
By November 13, NAR stops using this account.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter 9: BigRed79**

On November 3rd, /u/BigRed79 makes a supsiciously NAR-esque post, [asking /r/AskWomen if they’d stay with a cheater](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/12powl/if_your_husbandboyfriendfiance_had_an_affair/) and described having a [pregnant wife and 2 kids](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/12powl/if_your_husbandboyfriendfiance_had_an_affair/c6x4cos), along with his ongoing affair. He, like NAR, [blames his wife’s “trust issues”](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12ztdq/can_a_marriage_be_better_after_an_affair_33m/c6zlg33) for his affair, complains that [he doesn’t want a divorce](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/12powl/if_your_husbandboyfriendfiance_had_an_affair/c6x56a4), and explains that he’s [fucked his mistress in his car and house](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/12powl/if_your_husbandboyfriendfiance_had_an_affair/c6xbjsb). He also calls Nebraska [his state](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/12p2l3/sil_saturday_i_learned_ty_burrell_phil_on_modern/c6xw9j2?context=3), as NAR did, and later posts his age, which is identical to NAR’s. Eventually, he also reveals his “SurvivingInfidelity” forum name is “CheaterNoah.”

Under this new account, BigRed79/Noah [asks r/relationships if he can fix his marriage after his affair](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12ztdq/can_a_marriage_be_better_after_an_affair_33m/), and gets told to confess to his wife. He confesses to [keeping a diary of the affair](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12ztdq/can_a_marriage_be_better_after_an_affair_33m/c6zjh77) and talks about what he wants to say to his wife. /u/dreddit_reddit tells Noah that he doubts he’ll change considering his “history,” to which Noah replies 

&gt; My history is 1 affair. I've not cheated on my wife frequently or regularly. 

&gt;I'm going to confess and end the affair and beg my wife. Hopefully she'll consider taking me back. 

&gt;And I'll *continue* to be a good father. 

Noah also goes on to admit that [if his wife didn’t know about the affair, he’d continue it because he’s “not strong enough”](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12ztdq/can_a_marriage_be_better_after_an_affair_33m/c6zliln). 
He makes his last comment in his thread on November 14th, [directing users interested in his story to follow his handle, “CheaterNoah” ](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12ztdq/can_a_marriage_be_better_after_an_affair_33m/c71hhbk) on the SurvivingInfidelity forums.

-------------------------------------

**Chapter 10: The Confession**

On November 20th in the “Surviving Infidelity “ forums, CheaterNoah [writes about telling his wife that he wants her to help him tell Emma off on the 16th](http://www.survivinginfidelity.com/forums.asp?tid=478097). His wife responds by apparently saying “I don’t care” and crying. He complains that her response was “off-putting and hurtful to [him].”

This causes Noah to call Emma himself the next day, telling her that he’s told his wife and that their affair is over. When asked if they’re “done forever,”  Noah responds “I don’t know.”

His wife then stops talking to him for four days, and admits that she doesn’t want to decide what to do yet, but that she does want to talk to Emma to confirm his story. Noah hems and haws because Emma “can be volatile and I’m not sure what she will say.”  Noah goes on to say that his wife has agreed to go to counseling with him.

After being berated by other forum members for not making a cleaner cut from Emma, Noah complains:

&gt;I didn't ignore everything that was posted about no contact. What ended up happening is I wasn't getting anythign from my wife. She wasn't talking to me, giving me any idea of where we stand or how she feels. If my wife told me she wants to reconcile and work on our marriage I would have sent a brief, clean no contact message.

&gt;Maybe it was selfish but I didn't want to be cruel to OW. Especially if it turns out in a month my wife kicks me out and files for divorce. Then where am I? I don't have any clarity over where we are now, where we are going and its really difficult to make decisions without.

&gt;I need help ending the affair. I CAN'T do it myself. I know that. I'm not strong enough. If I could end the affair on my own without my wife's help or encouragement I would have done so. So I do wish she was more involved and active in this. Saying what she needs clearly and asking me to do things for her. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And so ends Noah's dirty dalliance with a 20 year-old bombshell... for now at least.

**Edit: Also, a big ""thank you"" to whomever gifted me 3 months of Reddit gold! You are a very kind and generous person. : )**

I’ve watched the [TiR](http://www.reddit.com/user/Trapped_in_Reddit) account over the last few weeks wondering what this individual (individuals? robots? aliens?) was up to and last night the user [tencents](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/v6tbs/oh_dog/c51wuch) linked a post/comment that tied to the one at hand. This got me thinking, so after checking only one more post/comment and finding a match, I jumped at the opportunity to share what I was able to confirm.

I jumped the gun.

I don’t know how this account amasses so much karma, but using the method that TiR admitted to was only used (as far as we can tell) a handful of times. Nowhere near enough for 500k+ comment karma. Many of TiR’s comments are contextual or personal in nature – there’s definitely a human being in there. Amongst other devices or people? Who knows.

Bottom line: by its own admission, TiR was experimenting with Reddit users for a handful of comments on reposted pictures, netting a few hundred comment karma. That’s it. That’s all we know for certain. This does not invalidate what the account has accomplished in way of community contributions over the last two months.

Karma is an odd thing. It’s an imaginary or arbitrary reward given to users of the site by users of the site. It is not redeemable for anything and more often than not is the product of chance, but it keeps us coming back for more all the same. At the end of the day it’s bragging rights at most. Most visitors to the site don’t even comment or post, making it even more of a niche feature to those of us who participate on a daily basis. Whatever the end-goal of the TiR account, it should be obvious even before this took place that it is just here to observe the community and its reaction to various comments – what works, what doesn’t. I’d have to imagine that the person behind the account takes great pleasure in participating and joining in the fun – the absolute last thing on Earth I’d ever want to do is be the catalyst to taking that pleasure away. Least of all instigate a witch hunt.

I humbly ask that we let this one go. Begrudge, fine. Feel a bit taken advantage of, okay. But this is not worth asking someone to end their life over. This is not worth sending messages filled with hate. Try to find some perspective here. We’re all here to have fun, expand our minds, and participate in the Reddit community. What that might entail is something completely different to absolutely everyone here.

I feel that I owe an apology to the Reddit moderators and administrators. In the heat of the excitement over the last 24 hours, there have been posts/comments made by myself as well as others that had been removed from various subreddits. The reasons were sound in almost all cases, mostly due to being off-topic from the respective areas in which they were posted. This was our own fault for not reading each area’s posting rules close enough and I apologize for any flak caught by the areas’ respective moderators. Specifically /r/todayilearned and /r/KarmaConspiracy: moderators had removed initial posts with good reason – they had absolutely no business being posted in those subreddits. Any other removals I’ve found to be for a good reason one way or the other, especially anything targeting the TiR account in a negative way. Please do not target moderators or administrators either. They are looking out for everyone’s best interest and just want to keep peace.

Can we please get back to our normal Reddit viewing positions?

For anyone wondering, this couple own a restaurant called Amy's Bakery Company and on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares recently. Episode [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnJFH8wgegI). The wife, and head chef, had already had lots of negative feedback online, so of course when this show aired more people started to see how horrible the business is. I personally disagree with the deletion of these, as the information about this restaurant was already widely available. Removing of links to the facebook page itself seems okay, but the entire thread is outrageous.

Legit.,jamburgles,885,182,484,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11cw8c/enhance_screenshotted_convo_between_potato_in_my/,"Alright, so **/u/Tiger3636**, an 8 hour old account that is totally not POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS, made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11c4j3/admins_have_shadow_banned_upotato_in_my_anus/) SRD post announcing that PIMA had been shadowbanned by admins (his [f]irst post, be gentle &lt;3). Therein [[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11c4j3/admins_have_shadow_banned_upotato_in_my_anus/c6l5pkz)], Tiger3636 briefly explained the situation and posted a screenshot of a PM conversation between ~~himself~~, uh, I mean between PIMA and Dacvak, the admin who apparently did the banning. 

Here is the **screenshot** of said convo: http://i.imgur.com/TUsIF.png 

**Protip**: [Listen to this while you read. It will make it better](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ii1tc493bZM). 

So Dacvak responded, admitting that he spoke with PIMA but stating that the [posted conversation screenshot had been edited](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11c4j3/admins_have_shadow_banned_upotato_in_my_anus/c6l5w5o?context=2).

/u/st3v3n requested proof of this claim (proof of the edits) from Dacvak [[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11c4j3/admins_have_shadow_banned_upotato_in_my_anus/c6l5xgw?context=2)]. Tiger3636 interjected [[here]](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11c4j3/admins_have_shadow_banned_upotato_in_my_anus/c6l62cj?context=3) to proclaim that Dacvak had a ""habit of faking screenshots,"" citing [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSBusiness/comments/117fjq/reddits_just_brought_up_3_new_admins_and_theyve/c6k3fzr?context=3) as evidence, and warning that ""anything [Dacvak] posts could just be an attempt to smear PIMA and cover himself."" Not sure how that's relevant to the screenshot, since it's obvious that PIMA took it (PIMA is listed as 'me' in the convo, and Dacvak is listed by his full name/as 'David')... but that doesn't stop him from getting upvotes. So it goes.

So /u/andrewsmith1986 responds to Tiger3636, saying: ""speaking of habits of faking screenshots, I think you have the wrong guy""
[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11c4j3/admins_have_shadow_banned_upotato_in_my_anus/c6l8zn4?context=4).

I'm about to tell you a tale of great woe and great selfishness: a tale that may go down in the SRD books as the greatest trainwreck that our generation has ever had the privilege of watching (or at very least, the butteriest). 

----------------------------------------------------------------
**Chapter One: ""I would never cheat on my wife. Ever.""**
 
It all started with [NoahsArcRises's first post, dated 1 month ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yuxsd/was_i_wrong_to_accept_another_womans_number_i_am/) in r/relationships. It was but a humble post with 6 points (14+:8-), and was nothing terribly out of the ordinary for the subreddit, just a seemingly generic question with the OP asking for the subreddit's sympathy. It was entitled ""*Was I wrong to accept another woman's number? I am married...?*"", and it is here that NoahsArcRises introduces our drama's players:

* NoahsArcRises - 33, married for 7 years with 2 kids
* His wife - 32, pregnant with their third child
* Emma - 20, college student

NoahsArcRises, here-forth called NAR, writes about meeting young Emma while out to dinner with his wife. While the wife was back in their car, he chats up the beautiful Emma, whom he soon finds out went to his Alma mater and who is ""his type."" His wife returns and jokes about how attractive Emma is, and it is here where NAR swears that

&gt; It was just a nice conversation. I didn't think much of it. I was just being friendly. I had zero plans of anything more. I would never cheat on my wife. Ever. 

As he and his wife are leaving the restaurant, he runs into Emma again and she gives him her number, and he reciprocates. On the car ride home, he gets a text from the vivacious Emma, who asks to have coffee with him sometime.

His wife sees the message and starts crying, accusing NAR of cheating and causing him to apologize.

**The Comments**

The top reply was by /u/slowdrowned, who reprimands NAR for letting a 20 year-old hit on him in front of his pregnant wife. He tells OP to stop basking in the admiration of a hot younger woman, and sympathizes with NAR's wife.

NAR replies and admits that the attention makes him feel great, and says that this is **NOT** (edited: thanks /u/greenvelvetcake!) the first time anything like this has happened. slowdrowned encourages him to knock it off in the future, and /u/BaconBuddy calls him a douchebag for his ""good prioritizing.""

/u/stephiej17 tries to defend OP, saying that NAR just made a stupid mistake and that his marriage needn't be ruined by it. She suggests that next time, OP should simply turn down an offer for a phone number.

Again, NAR tries to defend himself, saying that it ""would have been awkward and hurtful to just say no"", but /u/retrovm retorts that he should've just told her off because he's married. NAR admits that he's ""been kind of unsatisfied about a lot of things and it seemed like, not a big deal at that point."" BaconBuddy skewers him for it, calling him pathetic for ""framing it that way"" and telling him 

&gt;God, we laugh about guys like you on AskReddit ""worst date"" or ""thank god I'm not with that guy anymore"" posts. Unfortunately, when it's here, you're genuinely confused as to where you went wrong... and it's enough to make me sad.

Elsewhere, NAR also is adamant that his actions weren't ""wrong,"" arguing:

&gt;I'm trying to do the right thing here. I think the standard you have (and I guess my wife has) is a bit too strict. At the end of the day I won't fuck anyone else. That should be good enough. I feel like what you are talking about means I can't talk to any other women ever. That is too much. 

/u/boredwillow then tells him that he is either a troll or very selfish, and NAR incredulously denies both accusations.

NAR also later reveals that this date night was his attempt at ""try[ing] to improve things"" and in that in regards to this scenario being flipped (wife getting a college guy's number):

&gt;I'd be very surprised if a hot college guy was interested in a heavily pregnant woman. 

The rest of the comments are filled with people calling OP a selfish idiot and telling him to [""punch [him]self in the face""](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yuxsd/was_i_wrong_to_accept_another_womans_number_i_am/c5z2ru5)

--------------------------------------------

**Chapter 2: ""So I had a first date yesterday with a younger girl. It went well.""**

NAR makes his [second post, dated 1 month ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/z6qit/so_i_had_a_first_date_yesterday_with_a_younger/) in /r/AskWomen, asking if getting a blowjob on this first date with an ""early 20s"" woman was because he was ""just so much of a stud that it went so far or is she just easy?"" He was fairly downvoted, with 0 points (20+: 23-).

**The Comments**

/u/SheGivesGreatHelmet has the top comment, telling OP essentially that it takes two to tango, but the real popcorn begins with /u/poesie's reply to her, noting that NAR's married and that his comment history is ""weird.""

/u/thelostapostle also notices this inconguity, calling him out on it and telling the other posters that ""[NAR] doesn't deserve advice on helping him cheat."" NAR replies that ""It's complicated...And not related to this post"", and another /u/Sad_King_Billy tells OP that he won't judge him. NAR responds by sarcastically calling thelostapostle ""Sherlock Holmes"" and saying

&gt;On the larger scale, my sins are quite minor.

_________________________________________________

**Chapter 3: ""First Time Adulterer. Advice/Recommendations?""**

NAR appears again, this time [posting in /r/adultery 1 month ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/z6tws/first_time_adulterer_advicerecommendations/). Here, he is welcomed with a good upvote ratio (13+:9-). 

In his post, he says he hopes this community will be more welcoming, then tells the community his backstory about his wife, kids, and Emma. He admits that 

&gt;I've always had kind of soft boundaries with women. I've flirted with women other than my wife for the last couple years. Gone as far as exchanging numbers and texting a lot but I haven't actually met up with anyone yet. Something finally snapped with me and I just got a point where I don't care anymore. 

He explains that he went out with Emma the day before and again admits to fooling around with her, then asks for recommendations for when they inevitably start having sex.

**The Comments**

/u/throwaway_quinn has the top post, encouraging OP to use cash for dates and to not ""directly"" lie to either his wife or Emma. She/he warns NAR that there is ""a 30% chance [Emma's] first step is to go talk to [NAR's wife]"" if they break up. 

/u/thewingbed tells OP that it's ""a little weird"" that Emma would still be willing to fuck OP after getting his number in front of his wife, and NAR admits that he does have his doubts about her, saying:

&gt;I do have some hesitation over what it says about her judgement. I think its a tradeoff. She doesn't have perfect judgement but she has a great body and a fun personality. I've done the respond to craigslist posts since I'm bored thing before and she is in a different league physically. I don't know. I think it should be okay. I'm just nervous. 

Another user, /u/Blafusel12 almost prophetically warns OP to be careful, because

&gt;you might be just the perfect man to fall in love with. Happened to me. Ruined everything 8)

I’ve done my best to organize this drama in chronological order, but if I’ve made a mistake, please let me know and I’ll try to fix it.**

**Brief Summary of Background Drama**

For a few months now, /r/CreepShots, a subreddit dedicated to candid pictures of women in public, has been a source of great controversy on Reddit, and more recently in the mainstream media. A few weeks ago, a high school teacher who posted pictures of “hot” girls in his classes was [caught by a user who recognized the posted girl](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/09/27/georgia-teacher-under-investigation-over-sexualized-creepshot-photos-of-students/). His subsequent arrest gave CreepShots/Reddit mass media publicity. 

[Here’s the SRS post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/103do2/effort_reddits_voyeur_subreddits_creeping_through/) that documents the teacher’s CreepShots post (/u/weagleweagleweagle) and in the comment section, /u/jackiepanda claims that she’s going to email the teacher’s creepshots to the schools and police departments, to which a now [deleted] account says that they’ve found information to narrow down who the teacher is. 

After the teacher’s arrest, many blamed SRS’s anti-Reddit [Project Panda]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1006qd/meta_project_panda_the_fuckredditbomb/) campaign, several subs freaked about about r/CreepShots existence, and r/CreepShots submissions started getting inundated with downvotes and new members.

Cries for the sub to be shut down were met by the defense that the sub’s activities were perfectly legal, and such arguments were waged in comment sections across Reddit.

**violentacrez’s account deletion and doxxing**

Yesterday (10/10/2012), the infamous Reddit user /u/violentacrez deleted his account. 

Since the link to his “goodbye” is a [deletion wasteland]( http://www.reddit.com/r/violentacrez/comments/118a3d/well_guys_my_work_here_has_come_to_an_end/), I went ahead and found [this Google-cache of his post on coderedd.com](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:WXaNmAuEF-IJ:coderedd.net/r/violentacrez/comments/118a3d/well_guys_my_work_here_has_come_to_an_end/+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a). The formatting is in what I presume to be Python, but this Google cache has preserved the thread in all of its undeleted glory, including VA’s last post at 2:33 GMT:

&gt; 'Well, guys, my work here has come to an end.'
&gt;3 hours ago by violentacrez from self.violentacrez 

&gt; 'It's been real, and it's been fun, and it's been real fun.' 

For the curious: according to the CodeRedd code, the comments consisted mostly of users bidding VA goodbye with links to porn, wondering why he’d leave after posting an AMA, and whether all of the VA users (his account is allegedly shared) agreed on this deletion.

[Here’s](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/118bxy/violentacrez_reddit_pimp_and_source_of_much_drama/) the SRD post about it and linking to the now deleted thread. It is here where /u/ThaddyG almost prophetically wonders whether something happened to VA, saying:

&gt;Seems obvious to say but something must have happened to him IRL. Legal trouble?

Just a few hours later, power-user /u/POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS [writes this post]( http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/118qdg/the_real_reason_why_violentacrez_deleted_his/) in SRD, explaining that VA likely deleted his account because Adrian Chen, a Gawker writer infamous for being “anti-Reddit”, had doxxed VA after obtaining his personal information from an unknown source, though apparently even VA deleting his account wouldn’t prevent Gawker from running the story on him. PIMA posted pictures of conversations he’s had with VA in his post, including [one of a conversation where Saydrah](http://i.imgur.com/UqRA8.png) discusses Adrien Chen’s approaching her for a comment on a story about VA. 

On a note that may or may not undermine to PIMA’s offered explanation, /u/smooshie and /u/Niqualz [both point out]( http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/118qdg/the_real_reason_why_violentacrez_deleted_his/c6kaj2v) that VA’s real name and identity were already known because he had attended/organized  Reddit Dallas meetups.

**PIMA Mourns VA in /r/NSFW**

In a virtually identical post to the his SRD submission, POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS [posts an explanation for VA’s deletion]( http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw/comments/1190xz/mod_post_a_tribute_to_violentacrez_who_was_doxxed/)  and cautions his subscribers to be wary of posting personal details, reposts a NSFW of a model, and acknowledging that r/CreepShots has been shut down along with a screenshot of a threatening PM that one of the r/CreepShots mods received (more on this later).  He blames SRS for the blackmail, and muses that it’s “interesting the amount of stuff SRS is allowed to get away with on this site.”
In the comment thread, users call for SRS to get banned, hope that VA sues Chen for blackmail, and call for bans on Gawker.

/u/I_hate_bigotry catches wind of PIMA’s post and makes [this circlebroke post about it]( http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/11a2fp/pimas_revenge_or_how_to_play_the_hivemind/). In it, she tears apart PIMA for sympathizing with VA and posting so much about VA’s deletion.  


**SRS Celebrates VA’s Deletion**

[SRS Mod ArchangelleNoodelle makes a self-post bidding VA adieu](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/118i72/meta_im_sure_youll_all_join_me_in_saying_a/), and SRSister /u/whynot_shesaid voices suspicion over VA’s deletion after Reddit apparently got new admins that he wasn’t “in good” with as he apparently was with the previous ones. /u/Grickit also [notes that Reddit just hired a new programmer]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/118i72/meta_im_sure_youll_all_join_me_in_saying_a/c6kbtw4) who claims to have been a long-time Redditor, but who made a new account anyways, but acknowledges that this is just unfounded speculation.


**r/violentacrez Gets Modded by SRS**

Mod of r/violentacrez and several large subreddits, /u/ytknows [writes in an SRD post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1198zm/rcreepshots_has_been_removed_due_to_doxxing_of/c6kioa2) that he has added some SRS moderators to r/violentacrez for the inevitable “hilarious results” that would likely ensue, just as when he added them as mods to r/circlejerk.

The mods for r/violentacrez are now

* ytknows

* Castiella

* RobotAnna

* ArchangelleMichaelle

* ArchangelleTenuelle

* Lucifielle

* Lautrichienne

* RosieLalala

* jackiepanda

A newly modded /u/Castiella made [this post]( http://www.reddit.com/r/violentacrez/comments/11930v/a_change_in_direction/) introducing the “change in direction” that she planned on taking the sub, namely that it would now serve as an antithesis to the pedophilia that violentacrez was known for. In the thread, /u/JamesBar [asks](http://www.reddit.com/r/violentacrez/comments/11930v/a_change_in_direction/c6kdzro)

&gt;Honest question, is there any back story on how SRS made VA leave? 

&gt;edit: in reality, SRS doxxed and blackmailede VA and the /r/creepshot mods. Are you proud of yourselves?


And gets promptly banned by /u/Castiella. Castiella also makes a [Reddit request]( http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/11ap49/requesting_removal_of_deleted_mod_violentacrez/) to unmod VA from r/violentacrez in case he un-deletes his account. 
Back in SRS, [/u/ArchangelleStrudelle announces the Fempire’s newly acquired subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1192sf/meta_introducing_the_fempires_new_sub_dedicated/), and Castiella [explains that]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1192sf/meta_introducing_the_fempires_new_sub_dedicated/c6ke3xg)

&gt;The old pervert deleted his account and ytknows handed it over to AAstrudelle

/u/Laurelai also [posts about the SRS takeover](http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/1195b8/rviolentacrez_personal_subreddit_of_violentacrez/)  in /r/MetaHub, and [writes that VA deleted his account because]( http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaHub/comments/1195b8/rviolentacrez_personal_subreddit_of_violentacrez/c6koecr)

This is nothing new; Mind_Virus gets people pointing this out all the time. Apparently this has been going on for awhile, as 15 days ago /u/Mind_Virus told mocotazo [""I'm still kicking your ass all over reddit.

That was all from two weeks ago, though I don't recall any SRD submissions on point. Earlier today, however, /u/Mind_Virus decides that a user pointing out his reposting is [enough to qualify that user for r/worstof](http://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/un0un/asshole/). The post [was removed](http://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/un0un/asshole/c4wsyiw) because it seems that either /u/Mind_Virus has never been to /r/worstof or is just unaware of the rule in the sidebar: ""Don't submit links to user pages, static links only."" 

/u/Mind_Virus's post to /r/worstof is then [*itself* submitted to r/worstof](http://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/un1cm/mind_virus_a_wellknown_reposter_of_content_posts/) under the title ""Mind_Virus, a well-known reposter of content, posts a redditor's profile on /r/worstof because that redditor called out Mind_Virus on reposting."" In turn, this spawns a random [""Mind_Virus, fuck you""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ReportTheAssholes/comments/un57n/hey_mind_virus_fuck_you/) post on /r/ReportTheAssholes which is rather popular.

I think that's everything for the moment. Definitely lots of potential, as this seems to be more than an isolated event.

He also deleted at least two submissions today after users commented ""repost"" and downvoted his threads. ",,False,self,t5_2ss5b,1339039166.0,,,True,t3_unqb3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/unqb3/mind_virus_called_out_for_reposting_content_mind/,
1355637226.0,641,self.SubredditDrama,14xivv,[Announcement] A new rule to discourage invasion,stopscopiesme,970,329,898,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/14xivv/announcement_a_new_rule_to_discourage_invasion/,"Note: Skip down to **Here's How it Works** for instructions

Hi everyone. SubredditDrama has grown a lot in the past year, and with more subscribers has come a phenomenon referred to as ""popcorn pissing."" Threads linked by SRD will often experience vote brigading and comment invasions, with the top submissions being some of the worst offenders. Certain parties now even try to take advantage of this and use SRD as their personal army. 
It's gotten to a point where being linked by SRD is damaging the discourse in other subreddits. We moderators hate to see this happen, and I'd like to believe the majority of this community hates it as well. 

Voting and commenting in linked threads is completely unacceptable. We're here to watch drama, not to jump in, and not to cause it. It doesn't cost you anything to not vote and to not comment. However, voting and commenting can and does cause harm to those linked. ""Whatever,"" some users have said. ""They're just meaningless internet points."" Sure, karma is worthless outside of Reddit. However, it still means something. The downvote has been called a ""distributed democratic ban."" When someone is downvoted past the threshold, it buries their discussion. Each subreddit has its own unique culture, and voting is a huge part of that. By voting on linked comments, we collectively impose our views onto a community we do not belong to. Commenting is an even more egregious offense. No matter how wrong you think a linked user is, you don’t need to give them your two cents. And when a linked user gets a half-dozen rude replies from SRDers, that shames our subreddit.

Here are a few recent examples of invasion, compiled by Jess_than_three.

[A month old thread receives new comments]( http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaLog/comments/14jjml/subredditdrama_pics_is_the_phrase_op_is_a_faggot/)

[Vote flipping in /r/ainbow]( http://www.reddit.com/r/MetaLog/comments/14vz7u/subredditdrama_ainbow_a_man_makes_a_stark/)

If you are reading this, chances are that you already think that invasion is bad. Most of our users seem to agree there, and we thank you for it. Sadly, there is still a portion of this userbase that votes and comments in linked threads. To discourage this, we will be implementing a CSS trick called “No Participation.”

**Here’s how it works:**

A subreddit can display a certain stylesheet based on what kind of domain is used. In this case, linking to np.reddit.com instead of reddit.com will cause the subreddit to display the No Particpation stylesheet. It’s a read-only mode where users linked through the NP domain cannot vote or comment. This works only if the subreddit has installed the NP CSS. If not, linking to the subreddit with the NP domain will cause to display without the subreddit’s custom CSS, and voting and commenting will still be possible. This way we can still watch drama as it develops, but if the subreddit wishes to preserve its own culture by discouraging popcorn pissers, they have that option. 

From this point forward, we will be required submissions to link to np.reddit.com. It’s quite simple: When you find drama, and you go to link it, put the “np” in the domain. For example

http://www.reddit.com/r/NoParticipation/comments/10mqi3/how_to_install_noparticipation/

becomes

http://np.reddit.com/r/NoParticipation/comments/10mqi3/how_to_install_noparticipation/

Again, the ""np"" domain only works if a subreddit has installed the CSS for it. It's a way for moderators of other subreddits to combat invasion. This allows us to continue on as we have been, but limits the effect of any users who, despite the rules, have been voting and commenting.

If your submission links to reddit.com instead of np.reddit.com it will be removed by AutoModerator.

Special thanks to /u/KortoloB for making No Participation, and thanks for reading! I’ll try to be around throughout the evening to answer questions and concerns.

**TL;DR: It’s against the rules to vote and comment in threads linked by SRD. However, it’s still happening. To combat this, we will be required all links to use the domain http://np.reddit.com instead of http://www.reddit.com. If you do not link using np.reddit.com, your submission will be removed.**

------------------------------------

**Chapter 13: ""She's... so fucking mean""**

The day after Noah compares Emma to Laura, Noah makes his last post to date on SurvivingInfidelity.com, complaining that Laura isn't giving him any emotional responses anymore by ignoring his texts, and just being ""fucking mean."" He gushes about how great marriage counseling went, then again complains that he has to ""appease"" Laura because she claimed the marriage counselor was flirting with Noah. 

He even says: 

&gt;I am trying to make it right with her and she just doesn't recognize me trying. I was going to go to Indianapolis for a football game last week, but I cancelled for BW. Nothing. 

Falling back into his original negative mentality about their reconciliation, Noah questions how he's supposed to reconcile with someone who ""isn't trying to heal us"" and whose posts are ""just complaining about me or OW.""  Laura has also apparently stopped kissing Noah, ignored his ""I Love You""s and stopped wearing her wedding ring.

As others question what Noah expects from his wife, he retorts

&gt;I am not exaggerating when I say she either does not talk to me or makes snide remarks. That is it. I thought it was bad before, 
but **its soul crushing to live with someone who hates you.**  ...

&gt;I've taken all the initiative. I was selfish with my affair, but I am trying so hard to change now. 

He even references the incident where he compared Laura to Emma, except he leaves out that detail:

&gt;She takes even simple things I says and twists them. I told her I wanted her to talk ot me more and that is an insult. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter 14: Fallout**

Last Thursday (December 13), Noah made his latest and probably last post to /r/relationships using his /u/BigRed79 account. It's [since been deleted](http://np.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/14swrj/i_miss_her_and_i_dont_want_to_i_want_to_stay/), but I figured that would happen and so I [screen capped it](http://imgur.com/7rmhg) soon after he posted it. 

In it, he makes his typical SI post where he complains about his wife's treatment of him post affair, BUT adds that he

&gt;**can't get myself to a point of being ""over"" the other woman.** I obviously haven't told my wife this, but **I think about her every day. I miss listening to her. I miss her smell, I miss kissing her, I miss fucking her.** I just miss her so much. I thought she didn't matter to me and I was wrong. I haven't broke our no contact but its been such a test for me. 

&gt;And I'm wavering now. I looked up her twitter and **she has been posting tweets about me and how much she misses me too.** Fuck, I want to talk to her.

He again blames his wife for his wandering mind, and asks Reddit for advice on how to deal with these thoughts.

Many users chime in with the same advice as the SI forum members, encouraging Noah to stick it out and emphasizing that he needs to stop checking in on Emma. Horrified at the thought, Noah fatefully states:

&gt;My wife doesn't know I check up on Emma... oh god that would not go over well.

Then the thread blows up.

First, /u/Maehan submits Noah's latest thread [to SRD](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/14t4jf/reheated_popcorn_cheaternoah_comes_back_to/) in a concise summary post and gets 126 net upvotes for it (176:50). Contrary to popular belief, the composition of Noah's replies don't seem to change much after this post and the vote counts also don't budge much.

However, the next day, /u/BaconBuddy's comment becomes the focus of [a very popular /r/BestOf post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/14tskg/baconbuddy_simultaneously_rips_apart_and_provides/), with over 1108 net upvotes (2050:942) and the thread gets flooded with 486 new comments (according to my RES). Soon after, Noah's post gets removed and his posts on both accounts get downvoted *heavily*.  I also got a noticeable increase in upvotes on my last SRD post about Noah, as well as several new comments.

The rest of his comments are re-hashings of the same old excuses as to why he cheated, why he can't stay loyal now, and why he's not a ""crap father."" As for the other comments: let's just say they weren't very kind. [Disclaimer: I did reply to one guy, but it wasn't Noah.]

On December 14th, the same day Noah's post gets a flood of new traffic, the SI user ProbableIceCream [posted a link to my SRD post](http://www.survivinginfidelity.com/forums.asp?tid=479007&amp;AP=61&amp;HL=37452) in Noah's November 29th thread, confusing several members and causing the mod to delete his/her post. 

However, the cat was released out of the proverbial bag and **on Sunday, Laura made an SI post about several users messaging her links to Noah's Reddit accounts/posts**, an experience that was ""humiliating"" for her because not only did so many people now know about her marriage, but that Noah had been told repeatedly to stop having the affair but instead ""bragged"" about fucking Emma.

She comments that to her, Noah had tried to present his cheating as ""an accident"" brought about by Emma's crazy persistence, but now after seeing his Reddit posts, Laura realizes that ""he thought about it from the start and selfishly chose to cheat anyways.""  Laura goes on to say that his attitude in his posts was ""sickening"" and that she now ""felt like dying."" 

**She writes that she tried to kick him out on Saturday morning, but that he begged for another chance** and she relented then. However, by Sunday she writes that she has realized that ""HE DOES NOT DESERVE A SECOND CHANCE"" because he not only knew what he was doing, but that he was also still following Emma's Twitter.

Other SI posters do their best to comfort Laura, and by 5 p.m., she writes that she's finally going to kick him out for good. **By 10:56, Laura updates that ""he is gone"" from their home and that she has steeled her resolve to rid herself of this cheater**, calling Noah a ""pathetic loser"" and Emma a ""special type of bitch."" She then sheepishly apologizes for her ""salty language.""

---------------------------------------------------------

**Epilogue**

SI user ProbableIceCream, who posted the link to my SRD post in one of Noah's threads, made a Reddit throwaway (/u/retinacomplex) and sent me a message last night, which detailed a PM that Noah sent had sent him on the SI forums in response to his post. 

Noah writes:

&gt;I don't know you, at all. I've never interacted with you. We have nothing in common and I was trying to save my marriage. I've made mistakes, like any WS [SI term for Wayward Spouse] but was trying to change. **What I said on reddit, under an old account was during my affair when my mind wasn't right. It was a mistake.** I'm not proud of my decision to cheat at all, and I've been trying really hard to move beyond that.

&gt;**But thanks to you, my wife has seen those posts.** I don't know if you sent her a link of those threads, or just posted the thread here and someone else sent it to her but she knows. And I'm not in our home anymore and our chances of reconciling are almost none.

&gt;So, fuck you man. You had no right to interfere and bring information here from another site. Its fucking invasive and wrong. **We have a family together and its broken now, and you are at least partially responsible for that.** To link to the one post that puts me in the worst light possible. I've been trying to get that thread deleted on reddit to no avail. Why? What did you get out of this exposure?

---------------------------------------

**And so ends this cheater's tale.**

 Thank you, dear readers, for following this unexpectedly long saga, and a special thank you to those of you who tipped me periodically about Noah's newest posts.

I have noticed this trend towards ridiculously hypocritical demonisation of SRD by people who really, really should not be talking about it considering how much time they spend defending SRS. Yes, JTT, I'm talking about you. 

[redacted] Additional rules designed by SRDs opponents to cripple SRD should simply be called out as unacceptable.

Oh, your SJ sub's voting has been skewed by an SRD link? Cry me a fucking river. Better yet - go on a crusade against all meta-linking hubs. But this selective outrage against SRD, because our voting pattern does not agree with overall meta-sub powerusers' views has gone way past obnoxious.

First, to the origins of the biggest popcorn-fest reddit has ever seen: the moderator changes to /r/atheism. This began when /u/Notamethaddict makes a reddit request for /r/atheism in which /u/krispykrackers [states](http://np.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1ej2ul/requesting_removal_of_uskeen_from_ratheism/ca7kt54?context=5) that /u/Skeen is no longer active. /u/jij responds by saying he'll make a reddit request, [which he does](http://np.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1f7oeq/request_removal_of_skeen_from_ratheism_moderators/), triggering protestors in the comments, such as [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1f7oeq/request_removal_of_skeen_from_ratheism_moderators/cacagqh), [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1f7oeq/request_removal_of_skeen_from_ratheism_moderators/caj3v4p), and [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1f7oeq/request_removal_of_skeen_from_ratheism_moderators/cad95e8). After removing /u/skeen and installing [an unsuspecting /u/tuber as the new head mod](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fqsj1/what_can_we_do_to_change_the_ratheism_moderation/cacvs7i?context=3), /u/jij, as far as anyone can tell, then decides to dump the [no moderation policy](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/y0spz/a_reminder_the_philosophy_of_ratheism/) and [enact some mod changes](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fldpw/mod_post_new_moderation_policy/) that get rid of directly linking to memes, thus getting rid of karma whores. In mourning, /r/magicskyfairy prepares to [shut down forever.](http://np.reddit.com/r/magicskyfairy/comments/1flhr1/official_statement_msf_would_like_to_make_an/cabf42c) However it was not to be. /r/atheism users react to the changes by [politely disagreeing with /u/jij,]
(http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fsgsa/fuck_you_jij/) with one user spamming slight variations of [this message](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fsea1/who_do_you_think_you_are_to_arbitrarily_take/cadescw) no less than *77 times,* while another went so far as to say: [""This was for a long time the most entertaining forum on reddit.

Atheism isn't a philosophy and nobody gives a shit about an in-depth chat about the lack of something.""](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fldpw/mod_post_new_moderation_policy/cacuwrz).

Some redditors [fully](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fs930/lets_make_ratheism_free_and_open_again/cad9zaf) [support](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fs930/lets_make_ratheism_free_and_open_again/cada641) [him](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fs930/lets_make_ratheism_free_and_open_again/cada7wi), while others [definitely](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fs930/lets_make_ratheism_free_and_open_again/cadav2x) [don't](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fs930/lets_make_ratheism_free_and_open_again/cadabzc) [want](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fs930/lets_make_ratheism_free_and_open_again/cada6gt) him back. He then decides [he'll do his AMA now](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ftifq/ill_do_my_ama_now/), where he defends his inactivity by saying it's ""Because I keep a totally hands off approach where r/atheism is concerned, I have an alt account"". I'll save you the trouble, the AMA was pretty shit, with one user saying [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ftifq/ill_do_my_ama_now/caem6k2) about the whole thing. Some users though, such as /u/juliebeen are [less](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ftifq/ill_do_my_ama_now/cadmr4g) than happy. One redditor, after reading through some of his answers in his self post, states this: [I got a question. Can you please shut the hell up and stop making awful comparisons like this? Get over yourself.](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ftifq/ill_do_my_ama_now/cadmron) Another user [questions](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ftifq/ill_do_my_ama_now/cadn2jg) why he needed moderators in the first place. /u/CommentAccount_ states that since /u/skeen knew of the requirements for keeping a sub, [any sympathy I had for you comes to a crashing halt. You knew it could happen yet did nothing. You've come off as an aloof idealist during this entire time and this post isn't doing much good.](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ftifq/ill_do_my_ama_now/cadmpnf) After the essentially failed AMA in which he [admits defeat and bids us farewell](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ftifq/ill_do_my_ama_now/cadnr0s?context=5), /u/skeen comes back with a different approach, by [requesting /r/atheism](http://np.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1fzhit/requesting_ratheism_back/), to which /u/request_bot responds by rarely going out of character and [suggesting skeen take it up with the admins over at /r/reddit.com](http://np.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1fzhit/requesting_ratheism_back/cafb2lb). /u/skeen responds by saying he isn't creating drama.

Meanwhile, /u/tuber becomes a favored member of the community, by maintaining his [lack of involvement in the coup.](http://np.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1fre7k/oppression_oppression_oppression_highly_upvoted/cad85wt) He goes so far as to say it seemed sketchy before [an admin stepped in to clarify.](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fryeo/ratheism_how_do_you_feel_about_uskeen_founder_of/cadeduq?context=3)

During this entire shitfest, /u/jij decides to make a ""retroactive"" [feedback thread.](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ft250/mod_post_announcing_official_retroactive/) Some users are [supportive](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ft250/mod_post_announcing_official_retroactive/cadi4fs) of jij while others...

**The r/CreepShots Take Down**

At 3:10 on the same day, Gawker Media site Jezebel publishes an article about a ~~now-deleted~~ (EDIT it's back up, ~~but with only 1 post~~ EDIT 2: It's now password protected) tumblr blog about /r/CreepShots submitters and commenters. According to Jezebel, the blog was made by a “25 year-old female Redditor”  that they call “Samantha.” I've seen its contents and  it is *very* thorough, including marital statuses, places of work, pictures of the Redditors, and names of family members. 

Shortly after, r/CreepShots goes down 
(I’m fuzzy on the time here since Reddit posts over 24 hours just say “1 day ago”). [Here’s the SRD post on it](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1198zm/rcreepshots_has_been_removed_due_to_doxxing_of/) and [here’s the post’s linked screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/AL52y.png) of a message to /u/CreeperComforts from /u/HelloJK. In it, HelloJK threatens to out CreeperComforts unless he deletes all posts on r/CreepShots and apologies, privatizes the sub, mods HelloJK, and finally deletes his own account. In the SRD thread, PIMA says that he’s talked to CC and that CC is planning on going to the police to see if “anything can be done” about his blackmailer.

/r/CreepyShots goes up to takes its place, [but goes down shortly after]( http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/119xfo/rcreepyshots_is_banned_the_same_day_that/). PIMA shows up in [this thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/119xfo/rcreepyshots_is_banned_the_same_day_that/c6klo70) to explain that /u/CreeperComforts was being blackmailed, but adding that r/CreepShots was taken down by the admins after the Jezebel piece went out. /u/CarlSaganAMA chimes in to accuse /u/swintonblum of helping /u/HelloJK in doxxing CC, but doesn’t have enough evidence to back his claim up.

/u/iMacHunt also appears in PIMA’s thread, asking him why he’s created /r/CreepSquad and why he’s always drama-whoring around Reddit, but does not receive an answer. /u/moonmeh also points out the PIMA made [this AdviceAnimal]( http://i.qkme.me/3ra53g.jpg) that blames VA’s doxxing on Reddit moderators. [Here’s](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1191ns/scumbag_reddit_moderators_and_the_doxxing_of/) the post’s Reddit comment thread.

In /r/RedditRequest,  /u/Janet_Coquette [claims that /r/CreepyShots](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/119v0i/rcreepyshots_has_been_incorrectly_banned/) has been “incorrectly banned,” but nothing comes of it.



**/r/MensRights Fears It’s Being Taken Next**

In a post in SRD, /u/moonflower [notes that]( http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1198zm/rcreepshots_has_been_removed_due_to_doxxing_of/c6kfb5c) the r/violentacrez sidebar now says that r/CreepShots is next to be taken down, followed by /r/mensrights and then Reddit.  This annoys RobotAnna, who makes a [SRDBroke post complaing about “fucking moonflower…taking [the sidebar] seriously”](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRDBroke/comments/119cs7/fucking_moonflower_rviolentacrez_implies_that/). 

/r/mensrights mod /u/ignatiusloyola makes a [post about the take-down of /r/CreepShots and /r/violentacrez’s takeover by SRS]( http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/119k8j/rcreepshots_and_rviolentacrez_taken_over_by_srs/), referencing the SRD post on CreepShot’s takedown. He accuses SRS of promoting doxxing, and references r/violentacrez’s new side bar before saying that “they will be coming after me personally.” He says that the targeting of MR is obviously not because of “moral or ethical reasons,” but is clearly motivated by “power/control.” He accuses SRS of sheltering doxxers, blackmailers, and “the violent” and opposing the “legal right of individuals” before saying that SRS clearly wants to see *1984* come to fruition. 

In his edits, he blames SRS for the CreepShots take down and blackmail behind it.
MRAs come out in support for IL, telling him it’s okay to bail and destroy MR if it means “saving [him]self”, and everyone calling for SRS to be banned for criminal activity. /r/LadyMRAs also [comes out in support of /r/MensRights](http://www.reddit.com/r/LadyMRAs/comments/119sgh/srs_officially_threatens_to_dox_rmensrights_mods/), whilst approving of the takedown of CreepShots and VA’s deletion, and saying that “SRS’s little ‘Pandagate’” is a better solution than doxxing.

The MRA community also [begins posting about the doxxing]( http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/119yck/a_small_step_against_doxxing_blackmail_and/), blaming SRS for “cross[ing] the line again” and calling for users to hold them accountable. /u/lalicat urges fellow MRAs to utilize Reddit’s feeback feature to convince the mods to ban SRS, and blaming SRS for the r/Creepshots mod blackmail. 

**Other Mods Get Uncomfortable**

/u/doing_donuts writes in /r/modclub that [he “find[s] this whole situation disconcerting”](http://www.reddit.com/r/modclub/comments/11a2lw/i_find_this_whole_situation_disconcerting/) due to the fact that users of Reddit can break the site’s rules and laws so easily. He wonders if any other mods are going to be the next targets, referencing the r/CreepShot mod’s blackmail fiasco. Another mod, /u/PancakeGenocide writes that he was acquainted with VA and liked him, and notes that
&gt;If Reddit admins do not respond by shutting down [SRS], I will be incredibly unhappy and seriously disappointed in management.  

/u/Aradon questions where the proof is that SRS is responsible for the CreepShots black mail and PG responds with the HelloJK screenshot, but Aradon points out that that user’s history is clean and that there is still no definitive proof that SRS is behind the blackmailings.

**Who *Is* Behind The Blackmail?**

Despite seemingly almost universal blame to SRS for the CreepShots doxxings and mod blackmail, no one apparently has any concrete evidence that ties them to either event, and their mods have universally denied involvement in either.

In /r/ShitRedditSays, ArchangelleMichaelle [makes a post condemning the CreepShots mod blackmail]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/119gkw/metaimportant_rcreepshots_mod_blackmailed_into/), instead encouraging SRSisters to use Project PANDA as a way to “press the admins to make structural changes.”

Later in /ShitRedditSays, /u/bloodywankr[blames SRS for doxxing people]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays+none/comments/119ky5/why_are_you_all_such_assholes/) and asks them “why are you all such assholes?”  SRSisters are seemingly amused and ask him to “please tell us more about how we did 9/11”. SRS mod ArchangelleSyzgy also seems unaware of SRS’s alleged involvement, asking 

&gt;[Uhh, citation definitely needed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/119ky5/why_are_you_all_such_assholes/c6ki278)


While it is still unclear who or what groups (if any) are responsible for the CreepShots doxxes, it seems that SRS is not.


**CreepShots Doxx-ee Allegedly Assaulted**

In his newly created /r/CreepSquad, PIMA makes a post claiming that [a CreepShots member was “violently attacked [last night] and beaten up”](http://www.reddit.com/r/CreepSquad/comments/11b39y/modpost_last_night_following_the_publishing_of_a/). He claims that he can’t post pictures of this Redditor’s wounds due to concerns about “so called ‘vigilante’ action”, blames Jezebel’s feature on the Predditors tumblr for the attack, and asking members of CreepSquad to stay safe.

The top comment by /u/cardance asks PIMA simply

&gt;uh, where’s actual proof?

**An Update Allegedly from violentacrez Himself** 

In /r/mensrights, ignatiusloyala makes a post [updating the MRAs on VA’s status and the CreepShots doxxes]( http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/11baai/update_on_violentacrezgawkeradrian_chencreepshots/). In it, he posts the following words allegedly from VA:

&gt; 1) Chen did not in any way blackmail me into deleting my account. In fact, he specifically said deleting my account would have no effect on his decision to publish.

&gt;2) ytknows has been a mod on /r/violentacrez for years; when I left, he became top mod, and I assume he added the Archangelles. Frankly, I think it's funny.

&gt;3) I have no idea who gave my PI to Chen. What I said to PIMA about the admins was idle speculation, based on Steve and Max' well-known dislike for  /r/jailbait. I apologize for his release of those PMs.

IL goes on to say that it’s “not clear” whether SRS is involved with CreepShots’ doxxings or blackmail, but goes on to blame Jezebel and SRS for the victim in PIMA’s post about an alleged CreepShots assault.

**Mass Bannings of Gawker Media**

As noted in a previous SRD post, many subs have started to ban links to Gawker media posts, including /r/Autos, /r/hiphop101, /r/politics, /r/bad_cop_no_donut, /r/AncientRome and several larger subreddits.

**UPDATE AS OF 10/12/2012 ~~8:56 AM EST~~ 1:17 PM EST**

/u/POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS has been shadowbanned and [here's his PM to me](http://i.imgur.com/cUGZK.jpg) about it. In it, he accusses Reddit admin /u/Dacvak for the ban. 

[Here's a more comprehensive SRD post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11c4j3/admins_have_shadow_banned_upotato_in_my_anus/) about PIMA's ban, including a screencap of a conversation between PIMA and Dacvak shortly before his ban. In the comment thread, Dacvak defends himself and accuses the poster /u/Tiger3636 (account of 0 days) of photoshopping the conversation. Elsewhere in SRD, users are accusing Tiger3636 of being a PIMA alt.

/u/Saydrah appears to have been shadow banned. /u/Syncretic says that Saydrah has deleted her account, but /u/MisterAndristson [points out in this SRD post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11bypn/recapthe_great_dox_of_2012_or_doxgate_a_recap_of/c6lat6k) that Saydrah's about.json page [still shows her user information](http://www.reddit.com/user/Saydrah/about.json) whereas VA's [does not](http://www.reddit.com/user/violentacrez/about.json), suggesting that her account has not been deleted.

/r/CreepSquad has also been banned.

**Update 2: 3:32 PM EST**

/u/MisterAndriston has unearthed [Saydrah's InternetAMA goodbye](http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/11au8g/iama_saydrah_ama/) where she requests the shadowban.

/u/FieldsofAsphodel also submits [this](http://i.imgur.com/E8fCA.png) screenshot of the new VA throwaway that was used to make the above quoted statement on VA's account's deletion in the private subreddit /r/modtalk. Here, he blames the admin's inaction when it came to SRS for his decision to delete, not Chen's article.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Until Gawker releases their violentacrez piece, it stands to reason that there is more drama on the horizon, so keep a lookout for part 3.

Since the dawn of two months ago, [Trapped_in_Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/user/Trapped_in_Reddit) has been a very prominent power-user/novelty account/cewebrity, that has garnered a lot of attention and upvotes (+540,000 comment upvotes) from the Reddit community as a whole. 

His existence has spawned a lot of discussion, [from the nature of power-users](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/snnmt/trapped_in_digg_and_the_phenomenon_of_instant/), to the reality of [internet addiction](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/u27lv/today_my_girlfriend_told_me_that_she_would_never/c4rpz6s), but all in all he posted unmolested, and to much upvoted fanfare - even while dodging rumors that [he is andrewsmith1986, Karmanaut, and/or multiple people](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/us8hp/im_fairly_certain_that_as1986_karmanaut_and_tir/) (He posts, *alot*).

Not to say Trapped_in_Reddit was not involved in many dramas, see: [Trapped_in_Reddit gets attacked by frustrated user](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/tiqqg/how_easily_could_a_computer_program_emulate_the/c4n1w61?context=4), [Military using Reddit conspiracy resurfaces by user Trapped_in_Reddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/ut4q8/return_from_afghanistandog_goes_nuts/c4yb0d2) But Trapped_in_Reddit enjoyed a seemingly care-free Reddit existence, posting constantly, and reaping the karma hassle free (it should be noted that TiR has accumulated many Best Comment awards in his short time with us).

**The Witch Hunt Extravaganza!!**

With his name well known, and his comments at the top of many front page threads, many began to wonder how one person could have achieved such a stellar record, namely user /u/fumyl. 

18 Jun 2012: User fumyl posted [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/v6wz7/worst_hunting_dog_ever/c51ycgu?context=1) It was discovered that Trapped_in_Reddit was using [Karmadecay](http://karmadecay.com/) to search for old content as it was reposted to Reddit. TiR would then copy the top comment of the old thread, and re-use it in the new repost thread, as his own comment - guaranteeing many upvotes for the re-used comment. 

The gotchya moment was met with an [admittance of guilt](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/v7cmc/til_trapped_in_reddit_games_reddit/c520tpu?context=1), and a [karma whore gif](http://i.imgur.com/h5tks.gif)

Needless to say, Fumyl's discovery comment was quickly linked to the meta subs: [subredditdrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/v7f1c/fumyl_figures_out_how_trapped_in_reddit_games/), [circlebroke](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/v80ce/latest_reddit_celebrity_witch_hunt/) and [r/bestof.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/v7jvp/trapped_in_reddits_secret_is_exposed_by_user_fumyl/) [From there it made frontpage,](http://i.imgur.com/nJcfL.png) and was upvoted to +2700 - while TiR's comment was put out of it's reposted misery at -1900. 

As users became more virulant, the original discovery comment [was deleted by one of the mods of /r/funny - sparking a mod conspiracy](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/v93dl/fumyls_original_post_in_rfunny_exposing_trapped/). Then a [TIL post](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/v7cmc/til_trapped_in_reddit_games_reddit/), and [karmaconspiracy post](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaConspiracy/comments/v7fky/redditor_trapped_in_reddit_seems_to_be_an/) about TiR were also removed, furthering the conspiracy that TiR was either friends with a mod, [a mod himself](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/v7cmc/til_trapped_in_reddit_games_reddit/c51zuu8), or [an admin alt](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/v93dl/fumyls_original_post_in_rfunny_exposing_trapped/c52e321). 

While the comment was brought back in /r/funny, [presumably due to TiR's friend Andrewsmith1986](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/v93dl/fumyls_original_post_in_rfunny_exposing_trapped/c52edja), the TIL, and Karmaconspiracy posts remained removed.

In spite of (or due to) the thread removals, news spread like wildfire, and the greatest witch hunt since Mind_Virus, Karmanaut, and Andrewsmith1986 began. All of Trapped_in_Reddit's comments were vigorously downvoted, and users [sent him death threats](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/vdhpy/trapped_in_reddit_posts_a_strange_story_of_him/c53o8j3). 

&gt;Reddit is making a joke out of me, and you're all laughing at my expense and safety. 
 - Trapped_in_Reddit.

**LOL**

To add fuel to the fire, it was also claimed that TiR [made fun of a 3 year old burn victim](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/vd59c/put_out_your_beach_fires_properly_so_i_dont_have/c53ggg6?context=4).

In an attempt to quell the uprising, TiR claimed [he was conducting an experiment on reposting old comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/v7y7c/submission_reposts_vs_comment_reposts/)  [**copypaste of original TiR submission here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/v8vb6/trapped_in_reddits_submission_reposts_vs_comment/c52eu89), which in of itself created a shit storm in /r/TheoryofReddit, that ended in the thread being nuked, and the subreddit [changing its rules regarding meta subs as a whole](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/vcu9x/lets_talk_about_drama/). This claim also added *more* fuel to the fire, and increased the hatred of the frenzied mass.


Amidst this pitchforked mass, the same user who started the entire ordeal, /u/fumyl, made a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/v98ju/re_trapped_in_reddit_and_the_past_24_hours/) stating he had completely *jumped the gun*, and TiR had not been *as much of* a karmawhore as we all thought. Even stating:

&gt;Bottom line: by its own admission, TiR was experimenting with Reddit users for a handful of comments on reposted pictures, netting a few hundred comment karma. That’s it. That’s all we know for certain. This does not invalidate what the account has accomplished in way of community contributions over the last two months.

Fumyl even went as far as to post his [apology thread in every post he saw about TiR](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/v7f1c/fumyl_figures_out_how_trapped_in_reddit_games/c52famq)

**Oops.**


After discovering the entire witch hunt was a *tad* blown out of proportion, hecklers refused to let up, and TiR began experiencing what Reddit has claimed to be a mental breakdown, writing a [bizarre story](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vd9ng/what_is_the_one_childhood_secret_you_never_told/c53h4tc) in /r/askreddit featuring rape and incest. This was obviously met with:

&gt;Holy shit you are actually having a mental breakdown.  - thehumantowel

The post also nabbed him the honor of [being on r/worstof](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vd9ng/what_is_the_one_childhood_secret_you_never_told/c53h4tc).

Bathed in infamy, and toting a faceless horde of fervently downvoting hecklers, TiR has begun his slow walk into the void, [saying he is no longer going to use the account](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/vdhpy/trapped_in_reddit_posts_a_strange_story_of_him/c53p2jh), and have it go the way of the other numerous, now defunct, novelty accounts.


Even that was met with numerous downvotes.  [**See also**](http://i.imgur.com/ss1EL.png)

In a turn for the hilarious, TiR disavowed his claim of leaving reddit forever [by running to Mexico](http://www.reddit.com/r/mexico/comments/verdv/ayudame_m%C3%A9xico/). While in Mexico, TiR revealed  [that Reddit is his, ""job,"" and that gringos want to kill him.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/vexde/trapped_in_reddit_flees_to_rmexico_and_talks_down/) All of his posts received downvotes below Reddit's default threshold.

* **Update: Modern Era**

After a rather lengthy vacation in Mexico, TiR has returned to the English speaking world, and has resumed his usual posting habits. Although the pitchforks have been put aside, and Reddit as a whole has forgotten the entire ordeal, [his posts are pretty hit and miss to say the least](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/we4t5/a_scottish_man_gives_nikki_minaj_a_piece_of_his/c5ck0x3).

While Reddit's attention span may have waned, people still do [bring up the ordeal](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/wuflk/so_im_walking_through_my_hotel_when_i_run_into/c5gpbwk), but this has done little to tickle the passions of the masses as it did when the scandal first occurred. Due to this, TiR still enjoys regular 500+ comment karma on many of his posts.

and the original poster to note:

&gt;Seriously.
Posting something critical of suburban white people on Reddit is like burning a cross in the Vatican. I guess I should not have expected positive results.

What I find funny is that these types of questions have come up before  in /r/askreddit and it's always caused a shitstorm. Despite all that, people willingly enter these threads and get massively butthurt over the comments. What were they expecting?^1

Short summery of who Adria Richards is and what happened:

At a tech convention she overhears two guys making jokes about ""dongles"" and ""forking"" and because she was offended by the ""lewd nature"" of it, she took a picture of them and [publicly outed them](https://twitter.com/adriarichards/status/313417655879102464) on her twitter account and later [makes a blog post](http://butyoureagirl.com/14015/forking-and-dongle-jokes-dont-belong-at-tech-conferences/) about it. This caused one of the guys to be fired from his job, which in turn made Adria Richards feel like [Jeanne d'arc](https://twitter.com/adriarichards/status/313442430848487424).

Obviously her actions caused some anger and the company she worked for got under heavy attack from anonymous. Today SendGrid, her company, publicly announced her termination on [twitter](https://twitter.com/SendGrid/status/314768776577036288) and [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SendGrid/posts/10151502570463967).

Oh, and maybe I should mention that her job was ""developer evangelist""; basically maintain a good public relation with developers.

Now to the drama part on reddit:

First some in /r/technology:

[This thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1am37v/technology_evangelist_adria_richards_tweets/) was posted yesterday and the majority agrees that she is a [""fucking narcissistic, nanny state, cunt.""](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1am37v/technology_evangelist_adria_richards_tweets/c8ypnag). Now the fun part obviously happens when someone disagrees:

* [""This whole thread is yet another depressing example of why there are so few women in tech."")](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1am37v/technology_evangelist_adria_richards_tweets/c8z0peb)

* [""When you are trying to grok why there's not a lot of women in technology, read these comments.""](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1am37v/technology_evangelist_adria_richards_tweets/c8z8yyz)

* [""Heh. Turns out boys do cry.""](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1am37v/technology_evangelist_adria_richards_tweets/c8ys94n)

The same drama is basically being reenacted in [another thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1anrkg/two_men_kicked_out_from_tech_conference_pycon_for/).

* But this time [a mod steps in](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1anrkg/two_men_kicked_out_from_tech_conference_pycon_for/c8z8gn1) and causes tiny drama about suppressing information.

* [More drama](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1anrkg/two_men_kicked_out_from_tech_conference_pycon_for/c8z8jae)

Both threads have apparently been deleted and  /r/MensRights ponders over the ""why"": [Link](http://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1ap8wv/rtechnology_mods_have_now_hidden_two_popular/) 

.

Moving on to /r/TwoXChromosomes:

Yesterday [this thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1aoeii/adria_richards_calls_out_sexism_at_pycon_on/) discussed the whole Adria Richards drama with the top comment being Adria is [a giant hypocrite](http://np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1aoeii/adria_richards_calls_out_sexism_at_pycon_on/c8za9dr). Nearly nobody supports her...besides u/Astraea_M, who gets into various slap fights in this thread.

Astraea is actually so involved in this matter that they decided to create their [own thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1aqqzk/adria_richards_sexism_and_hate/) (because it went so well...). Unsurprisingly, people disagree and the whole thread becomes a drama gold-mine. 

.

There are more I am sure, but I am going to end here, because it already turned out longer than planned.

&gt;I apologize for the knee-jerk reactions that led to me posting this filth to r/atheism; content like this does nothing more than taint the perception others have of our subreddit, its users, and atheism as a whole.

In adorably stereotypical teenage reddit atheist fashion, /u/BixxyBerns wants /r/atheism to be with him on this. Really badly. His mother is persecuting him by taking away his gaming privileges, all because he complained his way out of the religious propaganda he was sure to endure at his cousin's funeral.

Enter /u/kingsumo_1, who oppresses him thusly:

Pardon me, did I say atheists? I meant fundie trolls.

Please, join me and hear the song of poor /u/BixxyBerns, and wish him luck against the torment of his parents and the fundie trolls. How will he ever go on?

Here's the short version of the story:

Girl meets boy. Girl wants boy. Girl can't get boy, because boy is homosexual. Girl goes on Reddit to plot revenge.


[
Here's the post](http://i.imgur.com/dDEx3fh.png) she first posted to /r/ProRevenge, and ended up reposting to /r/EvilBrainStorming:

&gt;I was in love with a gay guy, but he's one of a kind (a great singer, dancer, actor, really talented and everything I want in a person), so I couldn't settle to have him as a friend. So I persisted, and it came to the point where I didn't even need him to love me or even have sex with me. I just wanted him to go out with me for a month or two and just pretend he loved me (he's a really good actor). 

&gt;After that, I would've been satisfied and done with it, but he keeps refusing and he's dragged it out for 3 years. All because he thinks its cool to reject me because of my gender. I was really nice, polite, and funny, but then I realized that he didn't care what I wanted, and he would keep rejecting me, so I had to stop caring about what he wanted and was driven insane by his constant resistance. I just want him to give in to my ultimatum, but for some reason he thinks that his resistance will somehow make me stop pursing him even though I haven't for these three years.

&gt;His wants will not override my need, and this is something he should learn. He would have the most talented children, but is unwilling to use his sperm to fertilize a woman. He'd be famous, but I know for a fact that he wouldn't appreciate his fans and would be scared of them. He's a waste of space. He doesn't deserve what he has, but I do. I'd kill him, but its illegal. So, I don't know how to get my revenge or at least reinforce my ultimatum. To be clear, I have nothing against gay people; it's just this one guy because he's so talented, and those aren't traits that are easy to find in straight guys.

She is quickly told that she is in the wrong, and that she can't force someone to love her.

A choice example of the conversations she's having in the first thread include [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/ProRevenge/comments/1jpdb0/how_do_i_go_about_getting_revenge_on_my/cbh0uez) (also copypasta'd in, in case she deletes it):


&gt;I wouldn't be killing him because of sexual preference. I'd be killing him because he resisted my ultimatum and made me keep chasing.

&gt;&gt;Isn't it your fault then for continuing to chase him?

&gt;&gt;&gt;No. Because if he wanted it to stop he would give in.

In the end, a moderator of /r/ProRevenge steps in, and tells her to take it to [other](http://www.reddit.com/r/EvilBrainstorming) [subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/myevilplan).

[**Act II**
](http://np.reddit.com/r/EvilBrainstorming/comments/1jpg16/how_do_i_get_revenge_on_my_unrequited_love/)
Our heroine takes her search for vengeance to /r/EvilBrainStorming, undiscouraged by the people in /r/ProRevenge who thinks she is crazy for wanting to force someone to love her.

([Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/dDEx3fh.png) of the second thread, including her OP, in case she deletes it)

Unfortunately for our heroine, the good people of /r/EvilBrainStorming are no more accomodating of her wish to exact revenge on her homosexual friend for not wanting to date her.

I would recommend checking out the comments in both the first and the second thread - choice excerpts include [a strangled metaphor for why it should be perfectly acceptable for her to force someone into a relationship](http://np.reddit.com/r/EvilBrainstorming/comments/1jpg16/how_do_i_get_revenge_on_my_unrequited_love/cbgzghu)

Thus far, our heroine has received *no* help for getting her revenge (which, quite frankly, gives me hope; even subreddits ***about getting revenge*** won't help this one).

**FIVE DAYS AGO**

Friday /u/citizenthrowawayx posted [these images](http://imgur.com/a/RLn96) in this thread [""UM Social Media Director Jordan Miller lies on resume about bachelors degree, keeps job.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/14f6ef/um_social_media_director_jordan_miller_lies_on/)  There is little doubt about there legitimacy, and he is told to report it to the compliance hotline.  At this point he is still anonymous, only saying 
&gt;[*I work at U of M myself* and we constantly get these emails about integrity and reporting fraud and illegal activity... all lip service, apparently. I was asked to produce a copy of my degree certificate for my job, which I did. Perhaps it's a different situation cause I'm not a professional liar, but regardless an academic institution relies on its reputation and should at least have some minimum standard of honesty in the job application process. It's all about earning that degree that says something about you, right? Otherwise what's the point? We can all just make fake CVs or order PhDs from diploma mills and make a pile of money too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/14f6ef/um_social_media_director_jordan_miller_lies_on/c7cikah)  

&gt;*Regards,
Concerned Taxpayer*

*emphasis own.*

It should also be noted that Miller is only 3 credits short of the graduation requirement, but this is not mentioned on her resume, so she was effectively lying about it, regardless of scale.

**YESTERDAY**

Monday, the school's newspaper ran this article: [Social media director resigns amid allegations](https://www.michigandaily.com/news/12social-media-director-resigns-amid-allegations11).  Miller voluntarily resigned, without penalty or disciplinary action (although she's of course now out a $100k/year paycheck).

At some point yesterday, the original thread picked up again, where among other things, citizenthrowaway explains that his motivation is beyond mere concern for taxpayer dollars:

&gt;I'm her ex-husband, Dan.

&gt;[My real problem is that she lied about me in court and coached our son's testimony to get my custody terminated. So I'm trying to get custody of my son back. In case you don't know how the family court system works, what happens is when a woman wants to go in and lie about you and accuse you of abuse, they will just admit all her hearsay statements as evidence without any physical evidence of abuse, and terminate your custody without granting you a jury trial.](http://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/14f6ef/um_social_media_director_jordan_miller_lies_on/c7f24rg)

*UDPATE:* Court documents can be found at the bottom, under Edit 2.

This is when the real drama starts.  Citizenthrowaway starts seeing more downvotes across the board.  Not enough to counter the people who think he's still in the right, but certainly showing a certain amount of outrage at the ulterior motives.  Miller's character as a whole is called into question, about lying on her resume and allegedly in court.  [""Psychopath""](http://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/14f6ef/um_social_media_director_jordan_miller_lies_on/c7ffatz) is used at least once.

Of course comments start showing up too.

There's more of course, as the threads at 100 comments and climbing (albeit slowly - small subreddit).  Neither of these users have ever posted to /r/uofm before, and multiple zero-day accounts have posted as well, so at this point it's safe to assume the subreddit is drawing outsiders from other blogs or other subreddits.

He heads off and decides to /r/AskWomen: ""What is your impression of a man that has cheated on a girlfriend/wife?""

&gt; Kind of curious if it is sort of like just disgust over his past actions... or is it more complicated. I've been reading on another forum, and someone told me that women are attracted to men who cheat because it shows they are in high-demand and of ""value"". Is that at all true?

So blessed with that sweet-ass segue about high-demand and value, he settles in and waits for the broads of /r/AskWomen to validate his, um, repeated manly discretions in his now-infamous relationship.

The end result is too precious to be believed.  This might be the best example of all time where a sequel completely outdid the original.

Go to pretty much any other default, and you'll see a lot of rules and a lot of mods.

Top mod /u/skeen ran the subreddit as a place with absolutely minimal intervention, describing his vision of r/atheism's as

&gt;[totally free and open, and lacking in any kind of classic moderation.](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/y0spz/a_reminder_the_philosophy_of_ratheism/)

As top mods have total control over a subreddit, skeen would remove any moderators who did not run the sub according to orders.

&gt;[u/MercurialMadnessMan was censoring criticism of his mod actions (or something along those lines), u/skeen gave him the axe and had me swear not to add more mods when that came to light.

It's been speculated that fellow mods /u/jij and /u/tuber were not in agreement with skeen's philosophy, and would have liked to add more rules and lighten the moderation burden by adding more mods.

When the top mod of a subreddit is inactive for long enough, fellow mods can use /r/redditrequest to have him/her removed. However, if the mod in question just goes online and does something once every two months, (publicly or not) a redditrequest is invalid. 

Yesterday jij [made a redditrequest](http://np.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1f7oeq/request_removal_of_skeen_from_ratheism_moderators/) and because enough time had passed since skeen's last activity, he was removed as the top mod of r/atheism, making tuber the new top mod. 

r/atheism discusses [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1f8cyx/meta_skeen_has_been_removed_as_top_moderator/) and [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1f8g8j/ratheism_has_lost_its_founder_skeen_some_atheists), with some arguing in the latter thread


So now what? tuber is now in complete control. He could make huge changes to r/atheism, make just a few, or keep the status quo. I guess we'll have to wait and see

EDIT: A [PM](http://i.imgur.com/KHmrCMm.jpg) a user has with jij that strongly suggests jij would like to step up moderatrion in r/atheism and that tuber opposes it. Also, that skeen was coming back every now, explaining why he wasn't removed earlier.

GunsAreCool regular /u/xinebriated comes up with the idea to notify 'the media':
&gt;
&gt;[My main goal was to put some pressure on the admins about whether or not they are ok with guns sold on reddit.

It doesn't take long before the media starts writing about this story.
Here's a [screen cap of the Gawker story](http://i.imgur.com/2dXKnij.png), written by Adrian Chen himself. He calls the Reddit Assault Rifle 'the most terrifying thing on the internet'. 

After that [the Huffington Post decided to pick up the story](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/21/reddit-x---x--x-x-gun-reddit-logo_n_2736684.html%5D), and yup there's a video inside too. They end the article asking themselves if the reddit admins want their logo associated with 'the Newtown massace'.

The Blaze decides to join in too with [an article](http://i.imgur.com/HlK02NR.jpg), they even quoted Gabour himself:
&gt;
&gt;“It is time for reddit to ask itself whether it is morally justifiable for it to continue to allow the sale of guns,” the Redditor Gabour wrote.
&gt;
&gt;“Although I’m trying not to resort to hyperbole here, I think it fair to say that reddit has some blood on its hands for endorsing these transactions [emphasis added],” the post continued.

One of the Guns mod makes a [post welcoming Gawker](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/18yw32/welcome_gawker_we_literally_are_the_largest/)  to reddit and not long after that GrC comes up with a [mod post](http://www.reddit.com/r/GunsAreCool/comments/18ztyj/mod_statement_concerning_gawker_media_fuck_gawker/) where Gabour complains about his sub getting brigaded again and he gives his personal opinion about Adrian Chen.

----

Edit: I just found out GrC was founded by VA himself. A source who will remain anonymous pmed me the following 'statement':
---
&gt;VA created the sub after a gun nut called him a pedophile. He was a complex guy. He loved jerking off to ******'s with dicks, yet he yearned for sensible gun control, lulz.

&gt;I just think he deserves some savvy treatment otherwise SRS is going to shit all over him. He was a good guy. GrC is one of his legacies. Just try to understand that he took it seriously, and he was posting serious content (when he would get off his lazy ass to do it)

Edit2: additional media are reporting the story.

1346606365.0,388,self.SubredditDrama,z8j2d,[Meta]: Why is Syncretic banning people for violating a rule that they didn't break?,BipolarBear0,549,161,466,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z8j2d/meta_why_is_syncretic_banning_people_for/,"**EDIT 3:** Good people of SRD, please take note. I **DO NOT**, under any circumstances, want a witch hunt for syncretic. Return your pitchforks and torches, or if you can't do that then get a store credit, because we aren't going on a witch hunt today. I do not take issue with syncretic doing this, I simply take issue with the rule itself. Because it's a shitty rule. Don't hunt any witches.



As we all know, a few weeks ago the mods came up with a new rule: No posting in linked threads. Today, syncretic posted [an announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z7tzn/announcement_the_following_users_have_been_banned/) stating that he banned 14 users for violating this rule. Well I did the math, and found out some interesting things:

* It seems as if /u/Always_Horny_Guy posted in the thread unrelated to the drama, and he hadn't posted in SRD for weeks. There is no possible way for him to have broken this rule.

* Same for /u/thedevguy. Hadn't posted in SRD in days, and the last time he did was in a thread unrelated to the topic it even the subreddit.


* Same for /u/cramcramcram. He did not post in the relevant SRD thread before posting to the thread it linked to.

* Same exact thing for /u/Sir-Boasts-A-Lot. Not only did he not post in the SRD thread before posting in the linked thread, he hadn't posted in SRD for at least a week.

* As well as /u/tigerthink. Didn't post in the relevant SRD thread before posting in the linked thread. Didn't post in the relevant SRD thread *after* posting in the linked thread.


* /u/WorldWithoutPancakes? Not only did he not post in the relevant SRD thread before posting in the linked thread, he hadn't posted in SRD for ***29 days***.


* And /u/RichwardWolf. Didn't post in the relevant SRD thread before posting in the linked thread.

* Same for /u/uB166ERu. Didn't post in the SRD thread before posting in the linked thread. In fact, it seems like he is an active member of /r/feminism. He very well could have been directed to the thread from there.


* /u/redpood didn't post in the SRD thread before posting in the linked thread. The last time he posted in SRD was over 3 days ago.

* /u/Skwink also didn't post in the SRD thread before posting in the linked thread.

* /u/Teridax_ Didn't post in the SRD thread before posting in the linked thread. He only has 3 posts, and the last time he posted in SRD was over ***a month ago***.



So, out of a total of 14 users banned, only 3 of them actually broke the rule they were banned for violating: /u/Whalermouse, /u/SarahC, and /u/Strange_Dragons. /u/Strange_Dragons didn't actually post in the SRD thread before posting in the linked thread, but I'll give Syncretic the benefit of the doubt because he posted in the SRD thread soon after.



Please note: I used redditbots screenshots for all of these, just in case they deleted the evidence from their user profile.



So, what the hell is up? Syncretic banned 11 people unjustly for breaking a rule that was instated 2 weeks ago. A rule they ***didn't even break***.


Edit: It should be noted that the mods of /r/lgbt sent a list of users to be banned to the mods of SRD, and syncretic, seemingly without fact-checking, banned those users.


Edit 2: So now there seems to be only 5 mods: The two inactive top mods, BEP, MillenniumFalc0n and cptn_sisko. I feel like I had a part in this dramatic implosion of SRD.

He made a post in /r/Canada last night called [**""This is unacceptable behaviour for a moderator of a national subreddit. Especially the biggest Canadian subreddit.""**](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17dv6v/this_is_unacceptable_behaviour_for_a_moderator_of/), where he posted

&gt;... is the root of all of the problems here and contributes nothing good to the sub. He's responsible for almost all of the unfair bans and removals ...

StephaneDion's post rises to the top of r/Canada, with 1,081 upvotes and 781 downvotes.

**The Outing**

However, [/u/kcanuck points out](http://i.imgur.com/3qZEis8.jpg) that in the screenshot, RES shows SD having upvoted himself 6 times and downvoted LXII 18 times, and in sidebar, you can see that the logged in user is /u/26DeadHands, [a very right-wing poster](http://np.reddit.com/r/new_right/comments/17cr8a/william_kristol_the_audacity_of_nope/), [lazy troll](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17d503/the_game_is_up_canucks_now_hand_over_hans_island/c84ebf9) and [apparent](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17ab5o/muslim_immigration_not_a_threat_columnist_says/c83rgzu) [xenophobe](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17ab5o/muslim_immigration_not_a_threat_columnist_says/c83s551). 

This in and of itself isn't a *huge* deal, but SD's subsequent attempts at backpedaling and his self-contradictions make [the popcorn start flowing](http://finewhyfine.typepad.com/fine_why_fine/images/popcorn.bmp).


**Defense #1: It's just a throwaway!**

SD tries to defend himself, telling kcanuck that he had just made that other account, 
[/u/26DeadHands](http://np.reddit.com/user/26DeadHands) so that he could see if his main's comments were deleted. 

However, he later edits out the ""new"" part out of his comment when /u/desirecampbell [doesn't buy his excuse](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17dv6v/this_is_unacceptable_behaviour_for_a_moderator_of/c84n7x7). She/he points out that the sock puppet account is hardly new, as it's only a few days younger than his main and has been used to make more than 100 posts.

/u/guy231 also tries to clarify kcanuck's observation to SD, pointing out that the RES tallies indicate that SD *has* been using a sockpuppet (/u/26DeadHands). 

**Defense #2: It's my brother's account!**

SD [attempts to defend himself again](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17dv6v/this_is_unacceptable_behaviour_for_a_moderator_of/c84nkos), this time claiming now that he had simply signed into the wrong account and that 26DeadHands was his brother's account. He tries to discredit desire's observations, haughtily adding

&gt;Nice investigative journalism though. If I were 26DeadHands, it would mean that I've been on reddit for literally the last 36 ish hours, considering that my brother is also  /u/bannedCanadian. Don't tell him I told you that.


desirecampbell again calls him on his bullshit, pointing out that he had ninja edited out the ""new"" in his first defense and accusing him of sock puppeting to cause trouble in /r/Canada.

SD also [tries to convince guy231](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17dv6v/this_is_unacceptable_behaviour_for_a_moderator_of/c84n92a) that he accidentally logged into his brother's account, to which guy231 simply replies:

&gt;This is a different story than you used two posts up.

He then copies/pastes his response to desirecampbell to guy231 as well.


**Defense #3: *You're* the crazy one!**

[SD tries to turn it around on desirecampbell](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17dv6v/this_is_unacceptable_behaviour_for_a_moderator_of/c84nx5w), seething

&gt;You're out to lunch. I said that because I didn't realize at the time that I had taken the screen cap with the wrong account. If you think its impossible for two people to use the same computer for redditing, then I don't know what to tell you.

He then claims that his ""brother's"" accounts, /u/26DeadHands and /u/bannedCanadian have been Redditing a combined 40 hours and snorts that they couldn't possibly be his. 

/u/barosa debunks his claims though, responding that bannedCanadian is clearly just a bot  and /u/whomwhom [points out](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17dv6v/this_is_unacceptable_behaviour_for_a_moderator_of/c84ppds) that that bot works for /r/UniteTheRight, a subreddit mocking posts by ""Libtards"" on Reddit. He notes

&gt;This makes sense, given the nature of the politics you try to push all over /r/canada.

&gt;Say again: Fuck off.

In the end though, [/r/Canada subscribers don't really give a fuck](http://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/17dv6v/this_is_unacceptable_behaviour_for_a_moderator_of/c84p3zo) either way.

Redditors jump all over him. See [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/xccop/my_girlfriend_is_an_avid_reddit_user_im_hoping/) for the comments. There are too many great ones to list. 

OP posts [these pictures](http://imgur.com/hGEv4) as proof the ~~victim~~ girl he is proposing to is really his girlfriend. [Redditors lampoon him for various reasons](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/xccop/my_girlfriend_is_an_avid_reddit_user_im_hoping/c5l4ky0). 

Seemingly undeterred by the shitstorm that has befallen upon him, [OP continues to try to prove ](http://imgur.com/3A5q9)the girl in question is his girlfriend for some reason, even though no one questions it anymore because they are [too busy ripping apart OP and his GF](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/xccop/my_girlfriend_is_an_avid_reddit_user_im_hoping/c5l4gf3). 

Finally OP posts that this has been [a successful research experiment for his thesis on viral media](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/xccop/my_girlfriend_is_an_avid_reddit_user_im_hoping/c5l4q70) ([screenshot backup](http://imgur.com/wSe4V)) with [this accompanying picture](http://imgur.com/BWN3p) to top it all off.

Update 3: HaroldOfTheRocks made the frontpage with [his picture of a brick wall](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/xcgva/some_kids_climbing_a_brick_wall_wait_a_sec/). OP arguably delivers by [posting a video](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/xcfa4/redditor_proposes_to_his_girlfriend_via_rpics/c5lb49n?context=1) of him eating a naan bread and bacon ""sock"".

He asks if people would be interested in that sort of thing.

At this point, /u/HORWEENNUMBER8 enters the scene. Horween has a bit of a rep on mfa due to some of his posts to the fashion advice subreddit.

Moderating has become stressful for me. Plus, I feel like I can't be a moderator AND a member of the community at the same time, since that seems to be frowned upon for some reason. Besides, I can't even submit any drama without it being buried by the Daemon_of_Mail Hate Club.

There's way too much drama surrounding this sub (ironic?). Too many trolls, bullies, and people with a chip on their shoulder. And the strange expectation of mods taking a side. SRD should be a place to enjoy drama, not a battleground for SRS vs. everyone else.

Doing this only depresses me, anymore. And having a bunch of strangers on the internet affecting me definitely shouldn't be something that's normal, or healthy.

If I'm going to be a moderator of any community, I would want it to be something with more of a unified purpose; and with more of an actual community, instead of witch hunters and personal army generals.

Now, I'm not targeting anyone specifically with my words. I don't feel like I truly hate anyone, unless they're someone with the intent to harass and talk down on others for their own enjoyment or sense of entitlement. I feel like a lot of the hate toward me is unwarranted, but I'm willing to admit that things I may have said in the past were worded badly, and the way I handle things might not be the best way to handle them.

So, I may or may not continue to post to SRD, if anyone dares to allow me to have an opinion. But given that SRD has gotten way too big for it to feel like a proper community anymore, I'm giving up on moderating it.",,False,self,t5_2ss5b,False,,,True,t3_16dyt9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/16dyt9/meta_stepping_down_as_moderator/,moderator
1334222919.0,359,self.SubredditDrama,s5xub,[Meta] Concerning the suicide news currently topping our front page...,,465,106,370,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/s5xub/meta_concerning_the_suicide_news_currently/,"As of right now, the submission I'm talking about is sitting at +1328/-374. I understand that the post comes as a follow up to something that got a lot of attention. (skip below the line for the tl;dr)

But take a step back. Nothing that either /u/tad OR /u/sisterofblackvisions proves anything: Reddit has *not* been subpoenaed even going by the information in /u/sisterofblackvisions' post, neither the news story nor ""police report"" establish any ties between the reported suicide and the owner of /u/black_visions, and none of the information in /u/sisterofblackvisions' can be corroborated and as of right now, said user has not posted *anything* other than what was already linked to, not even to answer questions or comment further.

Am I saying that the story is fake? No. But the only reason people are jumping to conclusions about this story is because of the manner in which it was presented: Go look at the submission's title, the content in there. Look at the language used. The post is designed to lure people into concluding something that does not logically follow from the available information, intentionally or not.

~~----------------------------------------------------------~~

I see a big problem with the lack of neutrality in this submission. This is not uncommon for this subreddit, but stories as important as this one are - and given the nature of the story I think neutrality should be *very* important. There's a reason this site has a problem with users harassing each other over almost nothing, and I'd really like to avoid having that happen here.

...what do y'all think? The upvote/downvote differential suggests that most of you don't mind the neutrality issue, but I still want to hear opinions. Does the neutrality of this submission (and submissions in general) matter or not?

**EDIT**: In case you haven't seen it, [it is now pretty much confirmed that this story is fake](http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/04/reddit-scared-straight-for-encouraging-suicide.html).

&amp;nbsp;

### Prologue

/u/skeen is the founder of /r/atheism, dedicated to the topic of atheism. As a moderator and owner of the sub, he has tried as much as possible to let the sub run free without heavy moderation. He has a steadfast belief that /r/atheism should be as free as possible (basically run by the voters and contributors).

[One year ago,](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/rg164/moderator_message_updated_community_policy_for/) he posted an updated community policy for /r/atheism. A lot of comments poke fun at /r/Christianity for having strict rules and their ""no promoting an non-Christian agenda"" rule.

[Nine months ago,](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/y0spz/a_reminder_the_philosophy_of_ratheism/) he posted a reminder about these ideas. People believe this was a passive-aggressive way of reminding /u/jij who was on top of the moderator chain. /u/skeen has removed a moderator before for removing posts (despite that they were troll posts).

[Less than 12 hours ago,](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fr9vj/a_reminder_the_philosophy_of_ratheism_skeen/cad9s4g) /u/skeen realized that he was not a moderator of /r/atheism anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

-----

&amp;nbsp;

### The Removal of /u/skeen as a Moderator of /r/atheism

Knowing that /u/skeen had been inactive for many months, /u/jij made a [redditrequest](http://np.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1f7oeq/request_removal_of_skeen_from_ratheism_moderators/) to remove /u/skeen as a moderator. The thread is heavily flooded by users of /r/braveryjerk, /r/circlejerk, and /r/circlebroke who heavily favor the idea of /u/skeen's removal with a couple dissenting comments. If /u/skeen came back right then and there, this whole dramafest could have been about /u/jij being removed as a moderator instead [like some others were](http://np.reddit.com/r/AntiAtheismWatch/comments/1f8h66/say_goodbye_to_skeen/ca7zxpg).

The SRD thread about it can be found [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1fb093/top_mod_of_ratheism_is_removed_for_inactivity/).

&amp;nbsp;

-----

&amp;nbsp;

### /u/skeen Comes Back, the Butter Hits the Fan

/u/skeen's second discovery after learning he was demodded was the [new moderation policies](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fldpw/mod_post_new_moderation_policy/cad9tap) of /r/atheism where he is told off by other users.

But then /u/skeen opens a can of shitstorm with [a post](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fs930/lets_make_ratheism_free_and_open_again/) rallying people to give him control of /r/atheism again. He gets a lot of positive feedback in his post. The relevant SRD thread can be found [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1fsa28/breaking_uskeen_is_back_and_wants_control_of/)

/u/skeen has been commenting for the last nine hours (as I type). This is probably more activity than he has had in the last year or two. He even showed up in SRD.

#### UPDATE!

/u/skeen is hosting an AMA, which currently is about dead even with upvotes and downvotes. [Link](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ftifq/ill_do_my_ama_now/). /u/juliebeen, former moderator, is the [top comment!](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ftifq/ill_do_my_ama_now/cadmr4g)

&amp;nbsp;

-----

&amp;nbsp;

### OH MY ~~GOD~~ SAGAN

It's possible that /u/skeen is [giving up](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ftifq/ill_do_my_ama_now/cadnr0s).

His last post was an hour ago after non-stop posting all day. I think this is it folks. I think.... we have lost a legend. For six years /u/skeen has logged onto that account, and for most of those years he owned /r/atheism. Whether you liked him or not, he was probably one of the most influential Redditors on this site.

He probably won't delete it, but that userpage might not change ever again.

Goodbye skeen.

&amp;nbsp;

-----

&amp;nbsp;

### /u/tuber and /u/jij Respond

In an official announcement post, /u/jij [announced a future AMA and feedback thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ft250/mod_post_announcing_official_retroactive/).

#### UPDATE! (June 8th, 2013)

Although I posted his account eulogy already, /u/skeen did come back for a few more comments. His goodbye was apparently only temporary.

http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fv01d/mod_post_official_retroactivefeedback_thread/caeazg7

http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fv01d/mod_post_official_retroactivefeedback_thread/caeam9c

http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fv01d/mod_post_official_retroactivefeedback_thread/caeah17

http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1fv01d/mod_post_official_retroactivefeedback_thread/cae9jdi

Those are his posts in /u/jij's feedback thread, the last four he made after his premature farewell. It also appears that he's being heavily downvoted, which is a huge turnaround from earlier. It's possible that different groups of users come by at different times. However, in the feedback thread, it appears there is a majority of people voting to reject /u/jij's new rules.

**Original Post**

In r/pics, /u/kl3ver1 posted [a picture](http://i.imgur.com/MKGhK.jpeg) of a fortune cookie's prediction that children's laughter would ""soon be very near"" superimposed over a photo of 2 positive pregnancy tests. The title of her post was ""Worst. Fortune. Ever."" and most of the responses to her were mixing well-wishes with ""I'm sorry""s for her unplanned pregnancy.

**Quit your belly-achying**

Cepheia responded to the OP, chiding posters for downvoting others who suggested the OP be grateful for her unwanted pregnancy and declaring that people who don't want children should ""either don't have sex or wear a condom and take god damn birth control.""

Cepheia then reveals that she had her own unwanted pregnancy, 
but that she did ""a lot of growing the fuck up. A lot of learning not to bellyache about my own decisions."" and kept her baby. Her comment was downvoted heavily to -17, with RES logging it at (19:36).

/u/Amunium replieds to Cepheia, suggesting that she should have had an abortion if she wasn't ready for motherhood, then telling her that she had no business asserting that her way was the best way of dealing with an unplanned pregnancy.

**""Don't twist my words you arrogant FUCK""**

Amunium's comment pisses Cepheia off, causing her to fire back that she decided against an abortion because ""instead of being a pussy bitch about things, [she] grew up and became a much better person because of it."" She then tells Amunium that his/her ""ignorance must truly be bliss.""

Confused, Amunium asks what he/she is being ignorant about, then points out to Cepheia that she doesn't sound terribly mature for all of her name-calling.

Amunium might as well have shoveled a heap of gasoline-covered coal into a furnace, for Cepheia's reaction was nothing less than brow-burningly explosive and riddled with curses:

&gt;I don't need to stop swearing in order to have matured from what I was. I'm twenty two, not the Pope.

&gt;You telling me that I should have aborted my son, whom I love with all my fucking heart, is pathetic, offensive and a real jackass move on your end. My son is **awesome**. I made him, I'm proud of him you childless dickhead. Nobody will ever tell me I made a mistake with him without getting bitched out about it. Let alone physically assaulted if I'm close enough to them. I adore my child and I've made no mistake in keeping him.

&gt;I didn't say that people shouldn't not want to have children. Don't twist my words you arrogant **fuck**. I said if you DON'T want to have children then use a condom and birth control or don't have sex. But don't have unprotected or semi-unprotected sex, get pregnant and then act cool because you don't want the fetus you've created. That's absolutely pathetic and irresponsible human behavior.

&gt;Have yourself a good evening, ass wipe.


**""I will slice my wrists in the bathtub and sob about the ever so harsh world... of... the internet.""**

Responses to Cepheia's breatless rant were universally negative, with /u/Saava wryly noting:

&gt;If having a child means coming off as a huge cunt over the internet then consider me childless for life.

As expected, this comment also further enrages Cepheia, causing her to reply in a most melodramatic fashion:

&gt;Oh no, I'm a cunt over the internet who implied that I should have aborted my beloved son and somebody CALLED ME ON IT.

&gt;I'll go cry myself to sleep tonight. May you rest assured that your words were not wasted. I will slice my wrists in the bathtub and sob about the ever so harsh world... of... the internet.

&gt;DAMN YOU, RANDOM INTERNET FOE, DAMN YOU!

/u/Amunium also replies to Cepheia's rant, humourlessly breaking down each of her points and ending his/her post with the observation that ""you are probably the most immature person I've ever had the pleasure of communicating with.""

Finally, /u/YouAreABadParent (user for 2 months) appears, exclaiming with an all-caps cheekiness:

&gt;HEY GUYS. SHE'S 22 WHOLE YEARS OLD. AND SHE HAD BABBY BY ACCIDENT! SHE'S THE FUCKING MESSIAH!

The players: 

applefritter2 - raises concern about the venue size at canterlotgardens- 
http://www.reddit.com/user/applefritter2

Klisk - Head of PR for canterlotgardens
http://www.reddit.com/user/Klisk

Purpletinker - Previous host of BronyCon.
http://www.reddit.com/user/purpletinker

-----

Reddit Drama:
This story starts with applefritter2 posting to the canterlotgardens forums with concern over venue size being that there have been over 2000 tickets sold and the venue is said to only hold about a 1000.

Applefritter2 gets banned from the canterlotgardens forums. Posts to /r/mylittlepony/ instead. 

Klisk (head of PR) shows up and confirms that there isn't any drama here and that the convention can hold 3000 without issue. 

Then Klisk starts throwing around accusations that this drama has been created Purpletinker and choice words of 
&gt;""Because someone who, sadly, happens to be very psychologically distraught and in need of therapy is going out of their way to sabotage our convention over a baseless grudge. Enough so that this person is resorting to lies and distortions.""
&gt;

Expect that Applefritter2 is not Purpletinker. Then the real Purpletinker shows up. And now it gets interesting. 

-----

To understand the drama with Purpletinker and Klisk you have to progress back to what started this whole situation. This drama dates all the way back to an earlier con this year.

It's fairly involved and ongoing but the break down to the long ongoing drama is: 

* Money is stolen, The sum of money that started this whole thing: $ 800 USD
&gt;“ The head of their convention, “[Redacted]” (whose real name, as far as I am aware, is [Redacted] ) is a literal thief who stole $800 from my personal checking account via [unauthorized] use of my debit card.”
[Redacted]

* Friends of [Redacted] start a smear campaign towards Purple Tinker. 
http://purpletinker.deviantart.com/journal/Rumour-control-292821513

* PurpleTinker attempts to move on in her own way and suggests to canterlotgardens that their venue size is too small. 
http://purpletinker.deviantart.com/journal/?offset=1#/d5eqyda

* Image of said venue size. Numbers far less 2000.
http://i.imgur.com/EKFcr.png

*Finally this leads back to the current thread.

&gt; It's not about ""teaching someone a lesson"", it's just punishment. I'm pretty sure what she did was illegal on quite a few levels, and the fact that it's damaging to a business that I use to support my family makes me a little less willing to ""turn the other cheek"".

&gt; Yeah, I acted pretty scumbaggish and shared her picture with a couple friends. But for her to leak a bunch of shit to 40k people? Why on earth wouldn't I share that with her employer and school when she tried to effectively destroy my livelihood?

When I was added by BEP as a mod, I thought it was to clean the sub up a bit and enforce the rules. That seems like it's more of a challenge than it's worth, and not something I care to put the time into.



I'm getting old in internet terms, and with my real life more of a focus, the time I spend on reddit, I want to be enjoyable.  I moderate other subs that I have enough passion to put the effort into maintaining and participating in.  As I have gotten older my tastes have changed, and I don't enjoy drama and the sense of Schadenfreude one can get from a properly run drama sub.  I would rather be working on personal projects, developing my hobbies, and spending time off the computer than reveling in drama on the internet.  Sorry, but I'm 35 now, and I just can't enjoy this stuff like I did when I was 25.  Oh, I still like to watch the occasional car crash, but I don't like being so close to them that I get covered in glass, nor do I take joy when someone is hurt by it, I just enjoy hearing the glass crack and the tires squeal.

No, I'm not leaving here bitter.  I don't think you guys are evil shits, I'm not going to go shit on SRD in other subs and act like it doesn't stink.  I'm just moving on.  Have fun folks!

Okay these are not going to be nearly as comprehensive as the work hippiemachine did, who did [part I](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11bypn/recapthe_great_dox_of_2012_or_doxgate_a_recap_of/) and [part II](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11byvp/recapthe_great_dox_of_2012_or_doxgate_a_recap_of/). If she wants to do a better job than me on part III I'll gladly take this down and she can use whatever of this she wants. 

**The Adrian Chen Gawker expose on Violentacrez is released**

I'm not going to link to it, as it is banned here, but I assume you have some intelligence, so it is out there and contains tons of personal information.  This story is then reported on a variety of websites, including slate, theatlanticwire, Daily Mail, politico, Fox News, the Guardian and the Dallas Observer, Forbes, etc. AloyshaV, well-known friend of SRD,  [created a dox-free version](http://i.imgur.com/XRNwU.png) of the article and kindly posted it to imgur. 

Violentacrez is possibly fired as his website is just his resume with -October 2012 as his most recent job experience, however this is just speculation. 

**SRS does its thing and potatoes**

[SRS has some drama over the dox vs journalism](http://i.imgur.com/Zst4s.png) (-&lt; this is just a snippet, find the thread for the whole thing, not linked since it now contains dox) after new reddit admin Dacvak [messages the SRS mods](http://i.imgur.com/RSRjL.png) that links to the gawker and jezebel articles are not allowed. 

However, the reddit admins quickly backtrack on this as Erik Martin [emails Buzzfeed](http://i.imgur.com/OI17l.png): 

&gt; Update: Erik Martin tells BuzzFeed FWD via email: ""The sitewide ban of the recent Adrien Chen article was a mistake on our part and was fixed this morning. Mods are still free to do what they want in their subreddits.

SRS then proceeds to post the gawker article in the SRS site posted above, which is why it is not directly linked. 

The [accusation of SRS vote brigading](http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/11eydk/i_am_potato_in_my_anus_shadowbanned_by_the_lying/c6lx2pf) in POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS's [drama filled AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetAMA/comments/11eydk/i_am_potato_in_my_anus_shadowbanned_by_the_lying/) finally has proof leaked.

These could be faked but it would take a great deal of time and autism to do so, so I believe them to be real. 

POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS never gives out his gmail password to other reddit users to substantiate his claims that the reddit admins have lied [but continues to post in subredditdrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11foe4/srs_caught_votebrigading_in_irc_the_twist_all_the/c6m1tw4?context=1) as mods approve his comments one by one due to him being shadowbanned.

[Whole thread here,](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1js0l4/how_did_jesus_not_make_the_list/?sort=top) and to their credit the top comment is someone pointing out that well, historical consensus is he probably was a real person.

Further down, though, the anti-existential zealots really get stuck in, led by /u/Space_Ninja. In response to a post pointing out that that almost all historians believe in the historicity of Jesus, [Space_Ninja hits back, with a meme!](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1js0l4/how_did_jesus_not_make_the_list/cbhtqn0) The meme says ""Most scholars agree Thor probably existed because maybe some German guy swung a hammer once"", superimposed on an image of Thor. Ordinarily this wouldn't be a sufficient argument to debunk overwhelming historical consensus, but this is /r/atheismrebooted! If one argument is made in text and the other in a meme, which one do you think they'll side with? True enough, for the rest of that thread Space_Ninja is upvoted and PresidentEisenhower downvoted. At the end of this thread, Space_Ninja admits he questions even the historicity of their own spiritual founding father,  Socrates. Egads! 

Next hero up is /u/JimJones who joins Space_Ninja in [laying into someone suggesting that Jesus existed, just wasn't actually divine](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1js0l4/how_did_jesus_not_make_the_list/cbhrket?context=1) Poor PresidentEisenhower is lain into again for daring to suggest there Jesus *might* have existed. 

And finally, [PresidentEisenhower's first comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1js0l4/how_did_jesus_not_make_the_list/cbhsm32) which is downvoted simply for suggesting it's debatable. No! It's not! He's a myth, like the boogy monster and Santa Claus that mommy also lied to me about! 

Elsewhere in the thread, [Wikipedia is dismissed as unreliable and biased towards Christianity](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1js0l4/how_did_jesus_not_make_the_list/cbhvfzo) and all the scholars supporting the consensus as ""theologians."" (+6, -0)

Also, you fuckers better appreciate the title, I'm more proud of it than I should be.

***
It all starts with a [post](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1gvnk4/quickmeme_is_banned_redditwide_more_inside/) by /u/jokes_on_you (ironic name amirite?) in which it comes to light that our glorious savior /u/ManwithoutModem had done some [detective work,] (http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1gvr4g/radviceanimals_mods_uncover_another_mod_as_owner/caoi4ny?context=3) along with [other moderators of /r/AdviceAnimals](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1gvnk4/quickmeme_is_banned_redditwide_more_inside/cao99l6)  It turns out that the [profitable meme makers](http://www.worthofweb.com/website-value/quickmeme) had installed the [owner of their company as a mod of /r/AdviceAnimals](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1gvnk4/quickmeme_is_banned_redditwide_more_inside/caoiq3t) and were engaging in a little [vote manipulation.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1gvnk4/quickmeme_is_banned_redditwide_more_inside/) However, the owners of quickmeme give an [explanation](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1gza1g/developing_according_to_quickmeme_it_was_livememe/) - Link to the SRD thread, easier and more organized.

In the comments of the post, /u/ManWithoutModem and /u/24601G have a small [spat](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1gza1g/developing_according_to_quickmeme_it_was_livememe/capf08x/) over the circumstances of his demodding, where /u/2461G states: ""Nah. It's pretty well over now. We wrapped up the gtw08 and QuickMeme issue, MWM decided to work on his other subreddits, and we're all back to work.
"" /u/ManWithoutModem disagrees. [""Here comes a typical 24601G wall of text bullshit response that is full of fluff and no actual content""](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1gza1g/developing_according_to_quickmeme_it_was_livememe/capfbnh), and in a later on post states: [""I wasn't abused by another mod lmao, I left as a mod because of how terrible things are being run over there.""](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1gza1g/developing_according_to_quickmeme_it_was_livememe/caq4mrt) [Here](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1h34t0/leak_fallout_from_the_quickmeme_banning_within/caqdu0g) is a quick recap of the events leading up to MWM leaving. /u/LocalMadman disagrees on the grounds of his leaving, stating [""Sure you did.

It should be noted, however, that the moderators that have left resigned because of unfair permissions given to them.

The vote botting stopped, and, curiously at the time, /u/Hypah's alt account, /u/QuickmemeGamesReddit was banned. Hypah says this: ""In hindsight, this was obviously because quickmeme's moderator plant, reddit user gtw08, saw the mod discussion and was afraid of being caught."" Later on in the post, he calls out /u/khdutton as a homophobe and hate-filled poster, who, upon further inspection, was a sysadmin with over 255 IPS at his command to upvote his quickmeme based content. /u/GetBusy0987 describes the situation aptly: [""Swimming around in butter.""](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1gza1g/developing_according_to_quickmeme_it_was_livememe/caphvyt)

/u/Jokes_on_you then replies to Hypah's post, saying: [""Khdutton also has ties to NC, but I don't want to get shadowbanned.""](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1gza1g/developing_according_to_quickmeme_it_was_livememe/capgx7j) This post causes /u/old_nerd to quite literally shit a popcorn bowl and fill it to the brim with buttery popcorn, saying [""Jesus Christ, I love how you're throwing out accusations without ANY proof. Trying to destroy a company, to what end?""](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1gza1g/developing_according_to_quickmeme_it_was_livememe/caq5b9t) /u/Jokes_on_you responds by stating he never made any accusations, he only said what had happened. /u/old_nerd still isn't happy, [rustling his own jimmies so violently that he references a court ruling from 1993.](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1gza1g/developing_according_to_quickmeme_it_was_livememe/caq9rue)

The entire /r/AdviceAnimals popcorn making session appears to be over, *but who knows?* Maybe they'll fuck around some more for our amusement.

Here's his comment that sparked the drama

&gt;I expected that, so I appreciate you being serious.

&gt;1. She got me really drunk and gave me some pain pills. She paid me part of my paycheck in pills and got me addicted well before the incident (she was my supervisor), then got me really drunk/gave me some Oxycontin on the night that it happened.

&gt;1. She was kind of a big girl and since I was really fucked up plus not very strong, I couldn't really fight her back. Basically all I could do was turn my head to the side when she tried to kiss me.

&gt;1. I only told one person. We were on a school trip to DC where me and the girl who raped me had decided to bunk in the same room. After it was over, I ran out of the room and happened on this one girl who was also on the trip. I told her what happened and asked her to stay with me so it wouldn't happen again. She was very understanding, but I haven't told anyone else.

EDIT (8:15pm): So it looks like alienth hasn't responded to the /r/atheism question and it looks like he's ignoring it. /u/Modern_Caveman has said: 

&gt;""As of this edit, 2293 of your users are also curious, admins. At the very least an acknowledgement is appropriate. This has been the second to top question for several hours, and it's a little awkward.""

&gt;Quite right too. When a source you (presumably) previously respected reaches a different conclusion from you on some issue, you should never try to follow their reasoning, understand why they reached the conclusion they did, or see whether they've started from a different set of assumptions to you and (if so) ask which set is more reasonable.

_____________________________

**Background**

There had always been some concern about the effect that being linked in SubredditDrama has on a thread, and accusations that SubredditDrama's subscribers share a common agenda and vote in linked threads as a bloc. See e.g. [syncretic's ""Have we become no better than SRS? Are we now just another downvote brigade?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/pddrd/meta_seriously_rsubredditdrama_have_we_become_no/) back in February:

&gt; There is no reason this subreddit should be raiding other subreddits and downvoting comments made by users to -25 karma while upvoting the other side to +50 karma. That, my friends, is a downvote brigade. That is unacceptable.

&gt; We are better than that.

syncretic was not yet a moderator then, but /u/ZeroShift, the increasingly silent top mod of SubredditDrama, [agreed](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/pddrd/meta_seriously_rsubredditdrama_have_we_become_no/c3ogsqv):

&gt; We were never meant to be a downvote brigade. Ever.
However, it would be naive of me to think that it'd never turn in to one. With this stated, I could not have said it better myself syncretic.

---

**syncretic's troubled rise to power**

Some time later (June-July), /u/syncretic, mod of the SFWporn network who had recently and controversially taken over /r/TheoryOfReddit, became proactive about possible doxxing and was added as a moderator by /u/creepig, along with others [because ZeroShift was overburdened](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/w06b0/meta_so_srd_hating_syncretic_is_a_mod_here_now/c598ghy). This was not well received by the community, which saw him as a zealous censor and drama magnet: [""So, SRD hating syncretic is a mod here now?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/w06b0/meta_so_srd_hating_syncretic_is_a_mod_here_now/). As [creepig explained](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/w06b0/meta_so_srd_hating_syncretic_is_a_mod_here_now/c595qth):

&gt; If we're going to change the perception that SRD is a downvote brigade, who better to provide feedback than someone who has suffered from the supposed brigade? If it doesn't work out, we'll let him go.

Even then, higher-ranking /u/BritishEnglishPolice chided both creepig and syncretic for arguing publicly. syncretic christened his new position by banning someone, and brainstormed about rules that could ""force SRD to become more of a catalog of drama instead of someone's personal army.""

In response, /r/ThePopcornStand spun off as a subreddit for drama with ""no power user mods, no downvote brigades"", or as the SubredditDrama moderators called it, ""unmoderated drama"" (but ThePopcornStand's moderators reject that phrase).

[See LetsBeNicer's excellent recap for more.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/w1bb5/recap_syncretic_becoming_mod_of_srd/)

---

**Gearing up for more aggressive moderation**

Just a few days later, [syncretic announced](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/w7pg7/announcement_the_moderation_team_will_now_be/) that all removals and bans would now be publicly logged in /r/DramaLog. Top reply: ""Fantastic. You still shouldn't be a mod."" Then [criticism of specific bans](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/w7pg7/announcement_the_moderation_team_will_now_be/c5b2nzc).

Next day at ThePopcornStand, [""Hi guys. Syncretic banned me. Looks like I'll be finding drama here now.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/ThePopcornStand/comments/w7wwg/hi_guys_syncretic_banned_me_looks_like_ill_be/)

&gt; There's no reasoning with him. He simply declared me a troll and shut me down. 

syncretic proceeded to defend his actions in that ThePopcornStand thread, which became dramatic enough that it [was posted back to SubredditDrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/w89ps/syncretic_argues_with_his_critics_in/). Top reply: ""I can't believe he is a mod for this subreddit.""

---

**A new policy appears**

In an extremely controversial SubredditDrama post (Aug. 22), mod /u/eternalkerri jumped in [with a surprising admonition](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ynxtr/there_appears_to_be_a_cabal_of_highkarma_power/c5xa27s):

&gt; Do not post in these linked threads!

&gt; I will be watching, and I will ban hammer the shit out of you if I catch you.

&gt; I have messaged the mods of the involved parties and if any unusual activity is reported by them of a user, you will be hammer timed.

Ironically, all the downvotes buried the warning. The next day, [creepig posted an official announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/yplap/meta_posting_in_linked_drama_brigading_and_other/):

&gt; Are you going to start banning people for posting in drama threads?

&gt; Short answer: Maybe.

&gt; ...

&gt; Henceforth, if you make a post in a drama thread with the obvious intent of stirring the shit, you're gone.

&gt; ...

&gt; (Also no, I'm not going to demod syncretic, stop asking.)

---

**syncretic takes decisive action as promised**

So here's what I've reconstructed about how things went down this weekend. A moderator of drama-hotspot /r/lgbt [sent a modmail to SubredditDrama](http://i.imgur.com/FQz6D.png) with a list of ""SRD users"" who ""invaded"" /r/LGBTOpenModmail. (This information courtesy of then-SRD moderator /u/TwasIWhoShotJR, who [""edited the name of the sender out because they don't really need any shit from us""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z8j2d/meta_why_is_syncretic_banning_people_for/c62g4dq), but specified [""it was a normal one, not a crazy one""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z8j2d/meta_why_is_syncretic_banning_people_for/c62f5cy?context=1), i.e. [not SilentAgony or rmuser](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z8j2d/meta_why_is_syncretic_banning_people_for/c62l5pk?context=3), [nor RobotAnna](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDramaDrama/comments/z8co4/hold_onto_your_seats_srdders_syncretic_bans_users/c62ifqk?context=3), in case you're keeping score at home.)

So: syncretic posted [an announcement in SubredditDrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z7tzn/announcement_the_following_users_have_been_banned/) that ""The following users have been banned for pissing on the popcorn"", listing nearly all the same ones as in the modmail. Another subscriber [complained: ""Why is Syncretic banning people for violating a rule that they didn't break?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z8j2d/meta_why_is_syncretic_banning_people_for/);

&gt; out of a total of 14 users banned, only 3 of them actually broke the rule they were banned for violating

---

**Dirty laundry**

SubredditDrama's subscribers were outraged, but even a moderator, TwasIWhoShotJR, [expressed criticism](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z8j2d/meta_why_is_syncretic_banning_people_for/c62hb3u): ""Ugh. This is a hot mess."" He proceeded to share what he knew about how the decision was made and implemented among the moderators (which was surprisingly little, perhaps), and even [disagreed with the premise of the new policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z8j2d/meta_why_is_syncretic_banning_people_for/c62hyb9?context=1):

&gt; I will only ban people for using slurs, hate speech, and dox in our own sub.

&gt; What happens in someone else's sub is not my problem.

syncretic posted a lengthy announcement defending his actions, [""In response to my controversial mod actions as of late""](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z9r0r/announcement_in_response_to_my_controversial_mod/), which I will not try to summarize. Once again, negative reaction from the community, and [even from fellow mod TwasIWhoShotJR](http://i.imgur.com/e6BqG.png). The entire exchange is deleted, allegedly by BritishEnglishPolice.

**A great purge**

/u/BritishEnglishPolice, a.k.a. BEP, is a ""power user"" who moderates more large subreddits than anyone can keep track of - and therefore has plenty of other things to do. But the brouhaha in SubredditDrama was such a cacophony that it awakened the elder god from its slumber. He/she (conflicting gender information going around) [removed all lower-ranking moderators](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z9tdi/meta_it_seems_our_sub_has_only_3_mods_left_now/), which included creepig, syncretic, eternalkerri, and TwasIWhoShotJR. Though BEP has been silent, this information [comes to us](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z9tdi/meta_it_seems_our_sub_has_only_3_mods_left_now/c62qivn?context=3) through /u/JustisLewis, who was [temporarily (?)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z9tdi/meta_it_seems_our_sub_has_only_3_mods_left_now/c62quni) added as a moderator [after PM'ing BEP about TwasIWhoShotJR and syncretic's modfight](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z9tdi/meta_it_seems_our_sub_has_only_3_mods_left_now/c62qk5g?context=3), which JustisLewis [also posted in SubredditDramaDrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDramaDrama/comments/z9rfc/mod_drama_twasiwhoshotjr_and_syncretic_openly/). /u/Cptn_Sisko was also [reinstated](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/z9tdi/meta_it_seems_our_sub_has_only_3_mods_left_now/c62qhbb) ""while everything gets sorted out"".

**Aftermath**

/u/AlyoshaV, (in)famous for ""Smile! You're on SubredditDrama!"" bots, [formally requested ownership of SubredditDrama](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/z9tma/request_rsubredditdrama_refuse_to_ban_users_who/) because it ""refuse[s] to ban users who invade other subreddits from links there, highest active mod only cares about avoiding internal conflict"".

/r/AntiSRS, where people go to complain about /r/ShitRedditSays (allegedly much overlap with SubredditDrama), [took note](http://www.reddit.com/r/antisrs/comments/z8yy3/another_sub_has_started_banning_people_for/).

First is the [Meta] part of this post, in regards to comments justifying or even applauding the doxxing of other redditors:

As per our sidebar, SRD takes a strong stand against the doxxing of any redditor. Encouraging or facilitating the production or proliferation of dox has always been and will always be a bannable offense in /r/subredditdrama. In addition, such incidents will be speedily reported to the admins. If you see any post including IRL info of another redditor, please hit the report button and send a modmail letting us know. 

Note: ""Encouraging"" includes making it clear that you approve of a dox release. This is a step down the road towards changing the culture of Reddit, which is in general pro-anonymity and pro-free-speech, two concepts that are very intertwined online. If people see us applauding dox instead of condemning it, they’re more likely to think that it's acceptable. To think “Oh, I don’t like what this person has to say. I’ll just bully them into deleting their account by finding their personal info and revealing it, opening them up to IRL harassment. After all, they deserve it.” At the very least it makes it more likely that they’ll upvote or ignore a post/comment with personal info and move along rather than reporting it to mods/admins. Comments that appear to be applauding the release of dox or expressing sentiments that more such incidences should occur will be removed.

Getting on my soapbox for a second: doxxing is wrong. It was wrong for Adrien Chen to do it to VA, and for the same reasons it was wrong to be done to Lautrichienne. As a subreddit we used to know that. Witch-hunts and mob justice aren’t really justice. If a redditor breaks the law, report it to the admins and they’ll get in touch with the proper authorities. If a redditor is just doing something you disagree with, feel free to campaign against them or just ignore them, but don’t shred the cloak of anonymity we all hold dear.

The other thing I wanted to talk about is the aftermath of removing the rule against personal attacks, and the announcement of its reinstatement.

We've been seeing a lot of bitterness and hate in comments lately. Since removing the rule against personal attacks, the general level of discourse in the sub has fallen. Insulting people’s character contributes little to the discussion, and is no substitute for a well thought out argument. As such, the mod team has decided to reinstate the rule against personal attacks. Removing personal attacks isn’t done to protect people’s feelings, but to maintain quality of discussion. Comments consisting purely of a personal attack do not add to the discussion. Criticism is still perfectly acceptable of course, as long as you back it up. For example: “You’re a stupid bitch” does not make for good discussion. Any comment chain that is allowed to devolve to that level is probably not going to rise back up to a reasonable level of discourse. “I think it was stupid of you to do this, this, and this, because ___” does add to the conversation and can lead to an interesting dialogue. In closing dramanauts, let’s try to remain above the fray and avoid becoming the caricature of ourselves that certain other meta subs attempt to paint us as.

Please feel free to respond with any comments or concerns. I promise I will read them all, though it may take me longer to respond than usual as I am currently preparing for back to back exams today and tomorrow.",,False,self,t5_2ss5b,False,,,True,t3_12glfp,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/12glfp/meta_announcement_clarification_on_the_mod_teams/,moderator
1349163138.0,292,self.SubredditDrama,10t23e,AntiSRS mod MittRomneysCampaign begins campaign to ban SRS and possibly all other meta subs including SubredditDrama,WingedPastry,385,93,606,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/10t23e/antisrs_mod_mittromneyscampaign_begins_campaign/,"Earlier tonight /u/MittRomneysCampaign posted in [AntiSRS](http://www.reddit.com/r/antisrs/comments/10sp2g/announcing_rcleaningupaftersrs_a_subreddit_for/) and [SRSSucks](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/10snhh/i_have_created_rcleaningupaftersrs_a_subreddit/) about a new subreddit he had created called /r/cleaningupaftersrs.  The purpose of the new sub was to ""counter-brigade"" threads that the sub's users perceived as having been brigaded by /r/ShitRedditSays.  The sidebar explicitly encouraged vote brigading.

Within a couple hours, the admins banned the sub after an SRS user sent them [this message.](http://i.imgur.com/3aivQ.png)  In [this leak,](http://i.imgur.com/Ff9n4.png) the SRS user can be seen taunting Mittens, and Mittens admits that he is willing to bring down every meta sub including SubredditDrama in his campaign against vote brigades.

Mittens then posted a formal petition to [AntiSRS](http://www.reddit.com/r/antisrs/comments/10t0e4/now_that_the_admins_have_banned/) and [SRSSucks](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/10t0fu/now_that_the_admins_have_banned/) calling on the admins to ban ShitRedditSays for vote brigading.

If you'll pardon the editorializing, anyone who would advocate for such a blatant affront against free speech is lhitlerally Mitt Romney.

**UPDATE:** /u/MittRomneysCampaign appears to be extremely perturbed and is making multiple new posts every hour.  For example:

- [Announcing /r/karmakaustklan, a subreddit that is absolutely not a counter-SRS brigade.](http://www.reddit.com/r/antisrs/comments/10t1xn/announcing_rkarmakaustklan_a_subreddit_that_is/) ([cross-posted to SRSSucks](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSsucks/comments/10t1zq/announcing_rkarmakaustklan_a_subreddit_that_is/))

More updates to follow as events develop.

**UPDATE 2:** Mittens is really on a roll now:

- [A great counter to SRS's brigading. Don't upvote it though, if I see you doing that, ban time. Vote brigading is explicitly discouraged.](http://www.reddit.com/r/karmakaustklan/comments/10t2ab/a_great_counter_to_srss_brigading_dont_upvote_it/)

[Current area of tension, links to a thread with 95% of the comments deleted, probably by moderators.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/10c6vf/srs_downvote_brigade_attacked/)

Anyway, to explain what's going on, ShitRedditSays recently initiated Project PANDA, a campaign to email-bomb public figures and raise awareness and negative publicity about Reddit's decision to allow things on their site such as creep shots, upskirt photos and for not sufficiently moderating their rule against suggestive images of minors.

Their goal, to do what SomethingAwful did months ago to get all suggestive content of minors banned from the site, raise so much negative publicity for Reddit that the admins will be forced to ban subreddits like /r/Creepshots, /r/Upskirt etc to keep face.

[Their campaign of email bombing public figures including a few feminists and some journalists soon led to this article published by the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/sep/22/creepshots-revenge-porn-paparazzi-women) mostly about the issue of Kate Middleton's privacy being invaded with the paparazzi taking a topless photo of her without her consent or knowledge and in a private situation. Within this article, Reddit is mentioned and subsequently blasted for allowing the /r/Creepshots subreddit to exist. Advice from that subreddit is also quoted on taking 'creep shots' of women's asses/boobs/crotches.

People with emotions, and feelings, who deserve to feel just as safe as the rest of us - regardless of how awful the things they post on Reddit are, or how bad their online reputation may be. 

Making threats of violence against those SRD deems, ""villians,"" is completely not okay, nor is denigrating or revealing (off site) personal aspects of their lives for the purpose of entertainment. The simple fact is: SRD is spreading hate, and antagonism to it's linked threads, while fostering it within it's own - and it needs to stop.

This brings us to posting in SRD's linked threads.

Posting in linked threads, for the purpose of harassing other users violates those people's right to safety, and is essentially online bullying (aka: really immature bullshit). Posting in linked threads also irrevocably destroys any notion of SRD being for, ""observers,"" - a fundamental founding value of this subreddit.

""But I have important things to say in that thread!"" - if you found that thread in SRD, no you don't. 

Considering the amount of hate and vitriol that spews forth from our sub into high-profile linked threads, apparently all SRD has to say are caustic, hateful insults that are posted for no other reason than to hurt other users - and this is not okay. 

I understand that there is a huge overlap of users in SRD between other subs, and that is fine, but that does not change the fact that the entire culture of our sub revolves around the notion that being hateful, and all around *terrible*, in linked threads, and towards other users is *okay*. 

Guess what, it's not. 

SRD used to be about observing, and enjoying the content posted to it, not brigading threads with hate speech. Can we *please please please* go back to that?

[This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRescueForce/comments/y86sn/warning_after_rescuing_a_dude_he_shooted_me/) is started, in which the OP complains/warns of a player who shot him in the back and blew up what the OP originally claims is his camp, after the OP, a medic, rescued him. 

Members of the reddit [find the players Teamspeak ID](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRescueForce/comments/y86sn/warning_after_rescuing_a_dude_he_shooted_me/c5t747i)  and [ban him from the rescue force Teamspeak.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRescueForce/comments/y86sn/warning_after_rescuing_a_dude_he_shooted_me/c5t7o5i)


However, the situation becomes muddled when  [the culprit himself posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRescueForce/comments/y86sn/warning_after_rescuing_a_dude_he_shooted_me/c5tbede), explaining that he had only killed the OP after coming to believe the OP was a cheater, as the camp the OP took him back to was packed with obviously duplicated items (duplication is when players abuse a glitch within the game to unfairly gain large quantities of rare items). The OP responds, claiming that it is not his camp (though in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRescueForce/comments/y86sn/warning_after_rescuing_a_dude_he_shooted_me/c5t8i23) op suggests otherwise), but that the people who ran the Dayz server he was using had created it, and that when first found the OP and his friends had destroyed it. He then says that the server admins reset the server in order to get their camp back, so he claims to have decided the best thing to do is slowly give away their items to people he helps. The OP claims several of the items at the camp, including vehicles (which are hard to find), were found legitimately and belonged to him, and becomes more angry than he already was upon being told by the shooter that everything has been destroyed. The subreddit users become divided, with both OP and Smoofer (person who shot OP) being downvoted and upvoted varyingly.

Delicious drama is had.



**Brief explanation of Dayz &amp; /r/RedditRescueForce:**

Dayz (/r/dayz) is a game set in a zombie apocalypse, in which players are dropped into a large world, which is hosted on many player-run servers through which the players can switch between. There is no levelling in the game, players can only become 'better' by finding better equipment, which is randomly generated in certain areas. The game is a fairly realistic mod, based on the military simulator Arma 2. Dayz is multiplayer, and players are much more likely to kill than help each other, due to problems with trusting other players. When players die they randomly spawn in one of a number of certain areas, and their items remain on their old body, which can be looted.

/r/RedditRescueForce is a subreddit of players who behave as medics going out and rescuing other players who are dying. This is done by having the player log out of the game till the medic is nearby. This is quite a big thing because some medical help can only be applied by other players, and in general medical supplies are hard to find. If someone has a problem such as a broken bone they are fucked unless helped, most of the time.

**TL;DR EXTRA-SHORT RECAP**: a medic saved another players life, both of them reddit users, took the guy back to his camp, and upon coming to believe the medic was a cheater the player shot him in the back and blew his camp up. The medic then posted about this to get him banned so no medics will help him in future, but the situation becomes morally confusing when the player who shot the medic posts his side of the story, defending his actions.

edit: This poster did comment in the linked thread, then posted this and saw that he shouldn't have in the sidebar and deleted said post. This poster hopes that is ok.

edit2: making stuff pretty

EDIT3: [New development! OP has his grammar corrected post after post after responding to some pretty hilarious words from the person who shot him. Also manages to prove beyond all doubt that he makes use of the duplication camp for personal gain.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRescueForce/comments/y86sn/warning_after_rescuing_a_dude_he_shooted_me/c5td4n1#c5tdoya)

edit4: [Smoofer (person who shot the OP) has been unbanned from teamspeak.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRescueForce/comments/y86sn/warning_after_rescuing_a_dude_he_shooted_me/c5tl9m8) General thread view appears to have shifted from supporting the OP to supporting the guy who shot him, probably due to comments such as [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRescueForce/comments/y86sn/warning_after_rescuing_a_dude_he_shooted_me/c5td8vz).

edit5: I've noticed the number of upvotes/downvotes for certain comments I linked too going to levels previously unseen in /r/RedditRescueForce, and also a few people who are obviously from this subreddit. Bad Dramanauts. Remember if people get downvoted too much they delete their comments, and redditbots didn't get the entire thread! I'd screenshot everything, but... effort.

1336756232.0,275,self.SubredditDrama,tif0f,My new hobby: Watching WorstAnswerPossible being constantly tournament by hecklers who think he sucks.,novelTaccountability,434,159,298,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/tif0f/my_new_hobby_watching_worstanswerpossible_being/,"One of the highlights of my day is reading WorstAnswerPossible's comments in-context and seeing people constantly heckle him to the point where he breaks character and tries to garner pity for himself. This phenomenon will occur at least 2-3 times a day, so it's a pretty rewarding hobby. I mean [this just happened](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/thzs7/when_i_was_17_while_extremely_intoxicated_my/c4muda6?context=10) while I was typing out this post. It's a constant struggle between WAP, his critics, and his fans... and I LOVE IT.

For those unfamiliar with him WorstAnswerPossible is a negative response troll who just writes the most negative opinion he can in any comment thread (mostly r/askreddit). That's pretty much it. They usually involve rape, racism, sexism, pedophilia, incest, gay bashing, etc. In the past all the other negative response trolls would be buried in downvotes in a matter of minutes after posting their schtick and there are several well know trolls with high negative karma points. The thing about WorstAnswerPossible though, is that he gave himself a Novelty Account name, and now the Narwhals-Bacon-Retards, who tend to buy into reddit bullshit like to upvote him because they think reading his username makes his posts funny.

Another thing about WorstAnswerPossible is that he's a comment spammer. Often leaving 40-50+ comments per day. So with that being said there are a lot more opportunities to be heckled because he comments so much. He actually comments so much that it's hard to keep up with all the people heckling him, but at least 50% of his comments these days have negative replies to him and his schtick. The milder ones say stuff like ""I'm a fan, but you can do better"", or ""You're slipping a but, but upvote for effort"". Then they get progressively worse, til we get to the point where people are just telling him to ""die"" and are getting upvoted for it. There are even imposter accounts and accounts created specifically to ""troll"" him.

The funny part is that WorstAnswerPossible is so fragile that he's actually easily affected by all the teasing. And he constantly breaks ""character"" to defend himself from what he believes to be a mobilized conspiracy against him and is account. Which might exists, but I believe most of his downvotes come from the fact that even his former fans realize how much he sucks.

Here is a selection of hits just from the just the last 3 days or so:

I asked to be mod because I thought it would be fun, and it has been. I love SRD so much and Reddit as a whole. I thought I could do this through grad school but I can't. With more moderators I could, but I can't carry SRD on my shoulders, I'm not cut out for it. 

Here's the deal, ever since the whole ""mod fiasco,"" I have turned into the face of SRD, which should never have happened. I used to think I was unbiased and fair, but with every single piece of hate mail I became more and more bitter towards MRAs and SRS. 

I should never have become the person in charge on SRD, I just do not have thick enough skin. I used to be able to blow off hate mail and whatever, but they have become more and more graphic. I am way too sarcastic and people take my bans way too seriously now. For the record, my policy has always been, if I ban you and you message me saying ""Hey, I'm sorry for being dick, can you unban me?"" I always unban. 

But since I have become the ""face of SRD"" I have been receiving more and more ""hate mail."" Not so much death threats but more of ""I hope you fucking die,"" type mail. I usually just report them to admins and go on my way, but I have received so many right now, I think its best for me to lay low since people know who I am and which city I live in. I'm not really afraid for my life or anything, but you know...better safe than sorry.

I really hope you guys understand. I will return once someone takes the reigns over SRD, as I like being on the sidelines, not in front.

It's only been 21 days since the last update and in that short amount of time, an incredible amount of drama, pain and suffering has transpired. I had planned on holding off updating until the birth of Noah's child, but there is *already* too much drama for me to fit in one post.

And it is with that that I present to you what will likely be the last 2 chapters in this saga. Here is part 4 to ""A Cheater's Tale"".
-------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------

**Chapter  11: ""I don't know what is wrong with me""**

We last left off on November 20th, with Noah (33) posting on the SurvivingInfidelity forums about confessing his affair with Emma (20) to his wife (32), and not receiving the expected emotional response. 

Posters berated him for ""thinking only about [him]self"", and on the 21st, he goes on to defend himself with the same old lines: he says he confessed because Emma was scaring him by being too attached, blames his wife for his affair, and confesses that he ""[doesn't] know what is wrong with [him]"".  

He writes to a fellow cheater who berated his apparent selfishness:

&gt;I honest to God wish I could feel the shame you feel about your actions. I want to be there. I wish I had the drive to do whatever it takes to fix this but I don't. I don't know why. I did make a decision. I want to be with my BW [SI term for ""Betrayed Wife""] but.... if she doesn't want me - which I agree is her choice than **I want to be with someone who wants me.** 

On November 29th, Noah starts another thread in SI, this time complaining that his wife ""won't look at [him], won't talk to [him, and acts like [he doesn't] exist.""  He goes on to say that his wife had been ignoring him for 5 days and that he ""was beginning to doubt [he had]  the strength to take this."" He then waxes fondly about his affair:

&gt;**I was unhappy before but at least I had OW. Now I have no one** and I have a wife that is acting like I am dead to her. I am not all trying to get sympathy but it is very trying. 

As posters again tell him to be patient with his shocked wife and to hold strong on not contacting Emma, he re-hashes his disappointment at his wife's apathetic response and in response to asking if he had sold the Jeep he fucked Emma in:

&gt;No. Not yet. BW hasn't been in it since D-Day and if we start to move towards reconciling than I'll get rid of it. Just right now no one knows where we are, where we are going. 

He then asserts that he wasn't actually missing Emma, but he was ""missing the human interaction. The caring."" that he had with Emma and claims to want to have with his wife. Another poster urges OP to tell his wife about SI so that she might get some emotional support during this trying time, and Noah expresses great reluctance at the thought:

&gt;If she posts and the advice is negative I'm going to be kicking myself. So I don't know. Its going to sound incredibly selfish but I have to do protect myself too. My wife is eating and seems to be doing okay but I will check up on her and make sure she is taking care of herself. She is usually very responsible and I imagine everything is fine. 

[The next day in the same thread](http://www.survivinginfidelity.com/forums.asp?tid=479007&amp;AP=41&amp;HL=37452), Noah updates SI on a conversation he had with his wife after dropping their kids off at their grandparents' house. He writes: 

&gt;She started in on me in the car and it wasn't quite anger but it was more of just her being stunned at me. She asked me why again and we talked about things a little more on the way home and I let her say what she wanted to say. 

&gt;She opened up to me a lot and told me how she never ever wanted this to happen and how hurt she was that I would do this to her. That she felt betrayed and broken and that seeing me made her feel awful. 

&gt;BW wasn't saying anything because she didn't want to create a scene in front of our kids and because she wasn't ready yet. So it was wrong of me to be impatient with her. 

She eventually tells Noah that she doesn't want to divorce and that she'd like to work on the marriage, and together they penned and sent the following No Contact (NC) letter to Emma:

&gt;**OW,  [SI term for ""Other Woman""]**

&gt;**Our affair was a mistake and never should have happened. It was cruel and hurtful to my wife and children. I regret every second of our affair. I am committed to doing whatever it takes to fix my marriage and be the man my wife and children deserve. Move on with your life and leave me alone. Do not ever contact me again.**

Noah also gushes that he has created a timeline of recovery for them, but says that his wife wasn't interested in seeing it yet. However, overall he happily reports that he's starting to do more things for her to make her happy and that they're finally reconnecting, to the point where his wife let him kiss her. He then apologizes for the self-pitying tone of his past posts.
Posters go on to grill him on what his game plan is to prevent another affair, and he hesitantly answers that he had always been co-dependent on his wife, and questions how he could become a person who's less likely to cheat in the future.

By December 1st in that same thread, Noah almost laughs at how sappy he had been about Emma, writing:

&gt;And to think I came so close to reaching out to OW again. Its pathetic really. How fucking screwed up is that? 

-------------------------------------------

**Chapter 12: "" [M]y man-child of a husband couldn't keep it in his pants""**

On December 2nd, Noah's wife makes her own SI account. Due to the sensitive nature of this drama, I have opted not to share her user name or directly link to her posts.  I'll also quote her posts as little as possible due to the fact that SI is heavily indexed by Google. For now, I will simply call her Laura (not her real name).  

[Author's note: *I don't want to share her username because she's still an active user on SI and she has expressed a desire for privacy, though that's already been compromised as you'll read later.*]

Laura's first few posts are quite short, simply commenting on her disbelief of the situation and her hatred for Noah's actions. It is here where she reveals that she grew up in a home where her father was a cheater, and bemoans her life being ""changed forever"" and living in a constant cloud of suspicion because her ""man-child of a husband couldn't keep it in his pants.""

However, seemingly overnight Laura becomes an extremely active SI forum poster, commenting in 9 threads in 2 days. 

On December 3rd, she comments in a thread for pregnant betrayed wives, fuming that Noah cheated on her when she ""needed him the most"" and lamenting that **he seemingly ""hasn't cared for months"" while he was ""obsessed with little miss side piece.""**

She vents that she hates Noah for ""ruining this pregnancy"" for her and for ""turning it into a nightmare."" However, Laura promises other posters that she'll try to remain calm to prevent a miscarriage.

In a later thread asking if betrayed spouses would like to know the details of their SO's affair, Laura confesses that while curiosity does tempt her to accept Noah's offer of reading his affair diary, **she would rather not know all of the details and that it ""might be too much"" considering that seeing just a few texts made her want to kill him.**

That same day, she makes her own thread, saying she'd like to talk to Emma and ""lay it into her"" for fucking a married man and to let her know how many people she's hurt by helping Noah carry on the affair. The other posters try to talk her down, and Laura agrees with their assessment that Emma is a ""bunny boiler"". She professes a desire to ""destroy this girl"", and cries that not only is Emma very attractive, but she apparently had ""great sex"" with Noah.

Laura also starts giving advice to other betrayed spouses, urging them to leave because they deserve better.

On December 4, Laura asks other spouses how they got over their SO having sex with someone else so many times. She outlines the details of Noah's affair (length of affair, where he fucked Emma, number of times they fucked, etc.), and says that **Noah claims he was ""temporarily addicted"" to sex after their years of infrequent sex.**  

Laura tells another poster that she wishes she could just leave, but says that she wants to at least try to make it work for their kids. She sighs:

&gt;**I just don't want to believe this is my life.**

On December 7th, Laura joins another betrayed wife in disbelief of how different Noah's story about their marriage is from hers, arguing that she never denied him sex, that he had always been flirtatious which was why she had been accusing him of cheating, and sadly noting that all cheaters' stories on SI seem to have the same misleading twists to them.

Later that night, Noah apparently tries to text love messages to Laura, imploring her to respond and eventually **comparing her to Emma, saying that she used to respond to all of his messages.**  This sets Laura off, and she tells him to fuck off, angrily argues that Emma should've never been involved in their marriage, and again notes that Noah's neediness is comparable to a child's. 

She writes to SI about the incident later that day, still in disbelief that Noah could be such an ""idiot"" and that he still apparently didn't believe that comparing them was disrespectful. 

She sagely observes:

&gt;**He wants someone like OW who will tell him he is perfect when he is fucking up.**

&gt; I've been banned for no other reason but a lot of people don't agree with my opinions. The claim that I made alt accounts to upvote posts (that are not even mine) was no more than a sarcastic spoof in response to /r/MLPlounge[1] 's constant raiding for the past week. Well that's tough because reddit.com has censored my freedom of speech. I will be perusing legal actions against reddit.com with the Better Business Bureau and the ACLU if this cannot be resolved on this current level.

&gt; Edit: And come on, akamushii's post just now shows that you've posted on brony subs. Isn't there a conflict of interest here? I mean the fact that you describe me as using a 'shitload' of alt accounts when I used maybe 5 or 6. How is this a fair and objective ruling when you're personally involved?

1.  So it all started out with this thread where it was announced that MLG one of the biggest lan events in the world was dropping Starcraft 2 - http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/15732/20523

  The entire thread became a pitchfork war like r/Starcraft has not seen in sometime with many proclaiming (again) that this is the end of Starcraft. 

2.  As the pitchforks were still red hot TotalBiscuit a personality and team owner in the scene announced his retirement from casting Starcraft for as he said it what is the point. -http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/15729/20524

  This just led to more pitchforks and doomsday calling. Tb got his fair few forks thrown at him even getting [called out by one of his friends and another prominent figure in the scene, for drama whoring](http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/15727/20525)


3.  As the forks glowed red a new thread emerges reminding everyone to unsub from MLG demand their money back and quote the reason why to them. It seems in alot of instances this quote went something like [""fuck you for not supportting starcraft""](http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/7727/p8sp.jpg) 

 http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/15731/20526

4.  Here is where we hit the bottom of the drama a heartfelt and sad open letter to the community from one of its big figures Geoff ""Incontrol"" Robinson. A very very drama filled post - 

 http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/15734/20527


5.  And now for the twist. An hour ago a new thread appears announcing the TB has already being booked for a SC2 event and his tweet confirms the slight bashfullness he must be feeling - http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/15730/20528

  
6.  Which lead beautifully into the lastest thread from a half hour ago which posted a tweet from another key figure in the community and former Team Evil Genius's owner Sir Scoots who got leaked information that infact the reason the MLG will not be using Starcraft 2 for the last lan of the season is because the date was already pre-ordered by Redbull for their own event. - [**obligatory**](http://www.dramabutton.com/)

 http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/15733/20529

                                      

 
And now I am off to the microwave for the popcorn, Its going to be a fun evening watching this unfor!!

**EDIT 1:** So looks like this may be an updating r/Drama thread as more drama gets thrown in 

7. The community director for blizzard just tweeted https://twitter.com/kmicj/status/365879993995239424 Saying that the only company looking for a license that weekend was Redbull.

Moderator 9000sins is all-caps level angry that he's been removed as moderator along with the most of the moderating team by top mod /u/donbueno. Why has he been removed you ask?

Because he and the rest of the moderating team (well, exluding /u/donbueno and that other mod, illuminatedwax) agreed to a new rule:

Only 30-day old accounts may post or comment, it was supposedly to stop ""shils"" and ""trolls"".

http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1d3qaa/a_new_tool_in_the_battle_against_the_trolls_your/

The moderator /u/donbuenos removes him and then explains himself in the thread. 

http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1d3qaa/a_new_tool_in_the_battle_against_the_trolls_your/c9mx4jb

9000SINS is quite clearly *desperate* to become mod again. He makes a post on /r/redditrequest asking donbueno to be removed and 9000sins reinstated. The thread is nuked into a wasteland of [DELETED] within a few minutes.

Someone has hacked everyone's username/password in the game and pretty much just screwing around with the company. ,,333,83,158,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/14zl23/recap_a_different_type_of_drama_is_going_on_right/,"Heroes of Newerth is a game just like DoTA 2 or LoL (they are all basically clones of one another.) 

This whole drama started when a popular streamer got kicked out of a game and couldn't log back in. The hacker then came into the stream, said he has everyone's password, and to prove it, he took over the most popular player's account. He then posted Moonmeander's password in the stream for everyone to see. [He then makes a post and proves that he took over Moonmeander's account](http://i.imgur.com/DJLol.png) Here is the [video of it all happening in stream](http://www.twitch.tv//moonmeander/b/348625189?utm_campaign=archive_embed_click&amp;utm_source=bashtech.net) (It happens at end of video, 1:59:30)

The announcer of all the tournament games (BreakyCPK) [also got his Twitter account hacked](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/14ypen/breakycpk_confirms_password_leaks/) because his in-game password was the same as his twitter password.

After BreakyCPK got hacked, [the hacker pretty much started taunting him on Twitter using BreakyCPK's own account.](http://i.imgur.com/oSKgW.png) He then [advertises selling the accounts for 35 bucks each](http://i.imgur.com/tWt1d.png)

S2 (the company) then comes into /r/HeroesofNewerth and says [""We are looking into what is going on. We will let you know when we have more information,""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/14yckl/hon_database_hacked/c7hm5qr) and people are NOT happy about that. Before it said not to listen to rumors, but that was edited out later. 

So this guy with everyone's username/password in the game [then does an AMA](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/comments/14zj2p/i_am_the_guy_who_hacked_hon/) basically saying he's doing it for fun. 

Right now, S2 took down the game for the next 6 hours, so I'm just waiting to see how this all comes down. Someone has S2 by the balls, and its all pretty amusing.

2. ArchangelleDworkin submits it to SRS under the ""Project PANDA"" label, calling it ""child porn.""

4. Some speculate if the thread was deleted. [This screenshot](http://i4.minus.com:81/jAFjlNgesDmdO.png) is taken for proof.

5. A Gawker article (more specifically Jalopnik, the section of the Gawker network that deals with cars) is published with the headline ""[Reddit Is Now Creeping Out Over A Photo Of Jeremy Clarkson’s Daughter’s Breasts](http://i.imgur.com/KsXYS.png).""

Successfully debated, she edits the initial post to request that people use the [ENT] tag, even though she thinks that NSFW is only for gore/porn.

&gt;I've had something similar happen and it ... felt ... incredible.
&gt;
&gt;Got bullied by a huge bitch in high-school who called me ""she-male"" and ""dyke"" and all KINDSA shit when I was the new girl (with no friends to turn to for any kinda support). Threw shit at me (dirty tissues, mostly) and started a rumor that I was always checking girls' asses out.
&gt;
&gt;(Sounds like a repressed homo, am I right?)

&gt;Fast-forward 15 years ... I'm the head writer at the biggest ""fag-azine"" in the Southeast and I motherfrickin' LOVE my job and get paid well to do it.
&gt;
&gt;I recently went to visit my niece back in my hometown, took her to the skating rink. And guess who's there, refilling Coke for a birthday party full of screaming kids? The bully.

&gt;
&gt;You put this guy down and try to publicly humiliate him like he did to you and brag about your job and your possessions on a website to people you don't know.
&gt;
&gt;In some ways I can kind of understand why a high school kid brags and puts others down in high school to impress other kids. But for the life of me I can't understand why someone would do that in their 20's and over the internet to people they have never met.

It may not be a hate fueled screaming match, but it is funny regardless.  here's the backstory on what I can figure out:

/u/NotaMethAddict was mocked by /u/SeaSquirrel in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11wq2a/reddit_youre_dead_and_you_have_four_words_to_be/c6q899o) when /u/SeaSquirrel created his own subreddit /r/seasquirrel .  Since this occured in a high traffic thread, lots of user flocked to the subreddit, where /u/notamethaddict mockingly posted [this AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/seasquirrel/comments/11wzst/iama_subscriber_to_rseasquirrel_ama/). 

/r/SeaSquirrel returned with [this AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/NotaMethAddict/comments/11x1ru/i_subscribed_to_this_subreddit_ama/).

/r/notamethaddict [reacts](http://www.reddit.com/r/NotaMethAddict/comments/11xjsy/attention_rnotamethaddict_we_have_a_serious/) , /r/seasquirrel reacts because [/u/notamethaddict is a mod of /r/seasquirrel](http://www.reddit.com/r/seasquirrel/comments/11zjoc/glorious_comrades_i_detect_a_spy_in_our_midst/).

notamethaddict [declares war](http://www.reddit.com/r/NotaMethAddict/comments/11xjsy/attention_rnotamethaddict_we_have_a_serious/c6qh834)[, and sea squirrel returns the favor](http://www.reddit.com/r/seasquirrel/comments/11zdvq/this_subreddits_greatest_enemy_has_declared_war/).

now there's a bunch of war posts going back and forth.
([1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAWsIul8UzM&amp;feature=youtu.be),[2](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vv8KnZ_ZjyA/TYoVdEbfK0I/AAAAAAAAEKk/pPY7SYxtAV4/s1600/squirrel.jpg),[3](http://i.imgur.com/V6dRn.jpg?1)[,4](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_rw7QZhcMLL8/SDcvGJYIowI/AAAAAAAAAqk/j6jv8BGILGk/s400/Sniper-Squirrel--30002.jpeg) and much much more that I'm too lazy to link to).

currently, both subreddits are planning on raiding each others subreddit [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/NotaMethAddict/comments/1222jw/a_plan_to_take_down_rseasquirrel/) ,[2](http://www.reddit.com/r/seasquirrel/comments/123evz/rnotamethaddict_is_planning_an_attack_against_us/), and [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/seasquirrel/comments/123piy/re_rnotamethaddict_is_planning_an_attack_against/).


I personally find all of this hilarious, and can't wait to watch the dumbest war in history go down.  turtles vs seasquirrels.

I present to you the infamous [Karma Bomb post](http://i.imgur.com/3Kcxr.jpg). The reason I can't link to the original thread is that it doesn't exist any more. [It](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/fd4w4/karma_bombs/?sort=top) got completely removed and replaced with a custom message ""karma parties are not ok in either direction"" and graphic. 

Now, what the hell happened?     
MediumPace, the OP, posted a very good summary in a [followup thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/fdca1/okay_so_apparently_my_original_submission_caused/) which states as follows:       
    ""I keep reading questions from people who missed the events earlier today, so I'll try to recap. I submitted    
[THIS](http://imgur.com/3Kcxr) comic/inforgraphic to /r/pics in the morning. It was a pretty slow morning for      reddit. Something nice     
about no monstrous threads around, is that you can get a submission to the front page a lot easier. And you     
don't need anything that awesome to submit either, you just have to be better than whats around. Shitheads     
started piling into the comment section right before it hit the front page and decided to ""Ruined it for everyone"",     
by starting a downvote spree. One thing lead to another and folks just started spamming nonsense. Do you     
really need to write ""W"" 4,000,000 times in a post over and over again? People were actually doing that. Still,     
I must admit it was a little amazing/funny/scary to witness first hand. The spammers took over. Wonder why     
it took so long for the admins to catch on, but once they did they squished the post to nothing. I hate redditors     
who had to kill it for the others though. I was interested in a real debate about karma with everyone. So much     
for that wish. This is the first time I've ever seen a whole post killed like that. Even though I still love reddit,     
you guys make it tough sometimes.""            

The effects of the downvote tornado even [carried over](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/fdca1/okay_so_apparently_my_original_submission_caused/c1f3jjs) into other threads. 

I can't remember if there was ever an official comment on the situation beyond the message when you attempt to access the thread, if anyone knows of one I'll add it to the OP.

For a while now the modteam has noticed an excessive amount of SRS-related drama in SRD. Yesterday [a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/19xnx1/meta_ban_srsantisrs_drama/) has made us mods aware the community is also growing tired of the glut.

SRD has become a battleground for two warring factions. The flamewars come like clockwork, and downvotes start to get thrown around simply on basis of affiliation. There have been many attempts to game SRD and it seems some of them are paying off. 

Personally I'd say the real harm of the deluge of SRS-related posts is that they push good drama off the front page. I check the new queue fairly often, and many times really great drama never makes it out. Social Justice popcorn has gotten stale. 

Starting Monday, we're going to be doing a week-long experiment. All SRS-related drama will be posted to one megathread that will be stickied in the announcement bar. 

Now, before you freak out, keep in mind this is an experiment.

EXPERIMENT

**EXPERIMENT**

Also, not everything that gets labeled as ""SRS"" necessarily qualifies as such. People will say ""X happens in X thread, SRS finds it"" and then it turns out the thread was never linked in a fempire subreddit. Just because you see some fuchsia tags* commenting doesn't mean it's an SRS brigade. Often times SRSters will comment on SJ-related threads simply because it's relevant to their interests, not because of some sort of coordinated effort to game the comments section. 

The Megathread will be posted and stickied Monday, March 11th, at 12 a.m. EST.

After a week, if the Megathread didn't work out, we'll probably institute some sort of tagging system instead. 

Myself and some of the other mods will be keeping an eye on this thread to answer your questions and concerns. Thanks for reading and happy popcorning, dramanauts!

[Negro_Napoleon](http://www.reddit.com/user/Negro_Napoleon) was banned from [/r/Christianity](/r/Christianity) for posting one of their threads on [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) (under 'linkjacking' policy in place since 2010, to prevent atheists from flooding the religious subreddit with trolling and downvotes); mods also claim he trolled users (edit: [example](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/q1ura/)) and linkjacked more than once.

User complains that he had no idea about the rule, was never warned about the other offenses, that it's a stupid rule, and that the mods are being irrational (meanwhile, the mods reason with him for ~24 hours). User then asks if the ban will ever be lifted; in light of the above ~~butthurt~~ indignant thread on /r/atheism, mods say 'probably not'. User continues to pitch a fit.

As for his attempt to rally fellow /r/atheists, there were . . . mixed results.

* OP [cross-posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/BlackAtheism/comments/srfv4/i_want_to_discuss_an_important_policy_on/) to [/r/BlackAtheism](/r/BlackAtheism) ([which is apparently a thing](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/stpre/ratheist_gets_butthurt_over_ban_from/c4h1ule))

Edit: [An interesting discussion below](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/stpre/ratheist_gets_butthurt_over_ban_from/c4gwza3) has led me to admit that 'butthurt' was the wrong term to use.

Sometimes it's easy to forget that the IRC channel is not a cross section of /r/subredditdrama. We apologize for our mistake and return to our regularly scheduled drama.

**The SRS Megathread**

In other meta news, we are discontinuing the SRS megathread. However, seeing as the increased variety on the front page since its creation is something we want to continue encouraging, we will continue removing posts that consist merely of ""SRS brigaded this thing and is yelling at people"" and we will be directing them to /r/srssucks.  Other kinds of SRS drama are fair game to post, but may be tagged as low-hanging fruit (more about the new filtering system below). Under this new policy, dramatic happenings within SRS will still be allowed while hopefully discouraging stale brigading drama. To be clear, this will not just apply to SRS, posts just pointing out brigades do not belong in SRD, there needs to be some bona-fide drama attached!

**Filtering**

SRD has implemented a new filtering system! This is mostly in response to the weariness many subscribers have expressed with certain topics. These will be tagged as ""low-hanging fruit."" Drama from /r/cringe, /r/cringepics, /r/rage, /r/theredpill, /r/mensrights, /r/shitredditsays, etc. will usually fall in this category, as will topics such as SJ arguments and warphalange drama (though it has been a while since we've seen that).

You may have noticed that some posts that broke the ""full comments"" rule were flaired and allowed to stay up. We are removing that flair template in favor of a new rule: **ANY** post that links to the full comments must be a self post, preferably with some context attached. Note that links to full comments should still only be used either when a linked self post *is* the drama or when there are few comments and multiple trees containing drama.

[**Screencapped OP**](http://i.imgur.com/doFmO.jpg)

**Post summary:**

/u/enla1 tells /r/relationships about his and his girlfriend's unsuccessful attempt at having a threesome with his girlfriend's close friend. He describes feeding the friend wine in an attempt to get her drunk enough to have the threesome, even though both the friend and OP were reluctant to because the girlfriend was known to be a ""very very jealous person.""

Eventually the 3 end up on a couch, naked, drunk and awkwardly trying to have a 3-way kiss when their roommates walk in. Embarrassed, the friend flees and the girlfriend retreats to her room, where OP follows her and they lay down together. All seems well, but when it comes time for OP to leave for the night, she flips out in fear that he's leaving *her*. OP recalls the conversation:

&gt;Her: YOU WANT TO FUCK HER AND NOT ME.

&gt;Me: (ohh god)

&gt;Her TELL ME YOU LOVE ME MORE THAN HER.

&gt;Me: Shut up, you're acting insane.

&gt;Her: WHY WONT YOU SAY IT. BECAUSE YOU LIKE HER BETTER.

&gt;Me: This is just ridiculous if you are going to be this way I am going to leave.

&gt;Her: YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO LEAVE.

&gt;Me: Watch me.

When OP goes for the door, she tries to stop him, so he grabs her. She slaps him, and he tries to reason(?) with her by saying:

&gt;You are trying to force me to stay here that's equivalent to rape. You are raping me right now. Stop it.

She starts biting the fuck out of him, and he ""end[s] up closed fist punching her in the face a few times."" He then stays over at her place, they have sex in the morning, and he goes home. He then asks /r/relationships how he should explain his facial wounds to his parents.

**The Comments**

Support for OP was mixed, with the top comment by /u/jaxup [urging OP to document his wounds and to get out of his abusive relationship](http://i.imgur.com/mLhtX.jpg) at 145 pts. However, /u/chocolatehearts disagrees, saying that [OP was also in the wrong for punching her in the face](http://i.imgur.com/zq5wa.jpg) and got an almost even downvote/upvote ratio for it (20+:26-). 

In response to chocolatehearts' response, a major player in the drama, /u/mademoiselle_B [blames OP for not leaving or asking a friend for a ride,](http://i.imgur.com/9g0co.jpg) snidely adding:

&gt; Or his mommy and daddy if that's what he's so worried about

**This is where the real drama begins, starring /u/mademoiselle_B**

/u/SamRavister gets pissed at mademoiselle_B's comment, retorting:

&gt;Well well well, aren't we the twisted little bitch forever playing the harp about the woes of women? It's people like you that give feminists a bad name. It's people like you that cause men to get falsely accused of rape. 

mademoiselle_B defends herself by calling OP a ""woman hating asshole"" and gladly claims the title of ""twisted bitch"" for her comment.

OP then replies to mademoiselle_B's blaming of him, responding to her ""mommy and daddy"" line with:

&gt;nice shaming language you fucking cunt. im going to assume, despite a strong hunch that you deserve it, that nobody has ever beaten you, clawed your face off, and bitten you to the point of drawing blood multiple times. after a while, especially after a hard day drinking, you just kind of collapse from tiredness 

mademoiselle_B then asks OP if this is the first time a girl's gone crazy on him, implying that he has angered other woman to the point of insanity in the past, and OP simply responds that ""Yeah, actually... ????????????????"" it was his first time being assaulting by a woman. Ignoring this, mademoiselle_B says that:

&gt;it doesnt seem like you need that big of a reason to punch a girl in the face if you're saying i deserve it because i said you shouldve called your parents

The rest of that thread may or may not be [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/10cc6c/my_25m_gf_23f_lost_her_shit_after_urging_me_to/c6cacwo). At the time of this writing, it was not yet deleted and was just a continuation of OP and mademoiselle_B lambasting each other, as well as moiselle's giving out of her home address (??!!), saying ""im ready for the stoning. i know it'll hurt but i deserve it""  More users try to explain to moiselle that OP's girlfriend was endangering his life, but she continues to argue with them.

Don't worry, you'll see her again elsewhere in this thread's drama. 
 
**Crying Rape**

In a different reply to OP's post, /u/crazy_dance tries to [call out OP for saying that his girlfriend was raping him](http://i.imgur.com/gEbed.jpg) by not letting him leave the room. Incensed, OP defends his choice of words AND simultaneously insults MRAs by saying:

&gt;What's the difference. She used violence to force me to be with her. No penetration therefore it's not rape? Consent was blurry? Gee you sound like a rapist!

&gt;Edit-- As to the MRA troll, I severely doubt there is a single MRA anywhere in the world who has been involved in a threesome. Those guys have no balls

He goes on to later elaborate that 

&gt;the analogy is used to make a point, no its not perfect, but its not that different either. ESPECIALLY if you believe the (bullshit) idea that rape is about power not sex  

to which mademoiselle_B (sarcastically?) says that she ""think[s] he's a rapist too"".

**OP v. the MRAs &amp; mademoiselle_B**

A self-proclaimed MRA, /u/throw_away_11256, also [replies to OP's MRA insult post](http://i.imgur.com/zPBcq.jpg), telling OP that deserves to be ""fucked"" in the legal sense and calling bullshit on OP's self defense claim because ""you close fist punched your girlfriend in the face"". He goes on to tell OP that there's no chance that law enforcement with side with him. OP simply responds to the last point, cheekily writing ""Rite?""

As if on cue, mademoiselle_B appears again, this time to explain throw_away_11256's post. OP gets mad because ""you all just can't accept the reality of what happened"" and moiselle asks him if he ""can even hear [him]self"". This pisses of OP, and he tells moiselle to ""just fucking die already jesus christ"". 

OP also [both insults and praises MRAs later](http://i.imgur.com/nH9A9.jpg) by saying ""the MRAs are pussies who are off their rocker but that doesn't make them wrong about their general beliefs."" /u/MorbidMarshmallow tells OP that he has lost all credibility because he's ""proven [him]self an asshole, to which OP says that he doesn't care about ""man/woman bullshit."" Moiselle again appears, commenting that ""he's not an MRA troll you guys don't worry. he just your normal every day woman beater"".

**""Christ, what an asshole.""**

/u/Smitty20 replies in [his own thread to OP](http://i.imgur.com/FVcbx.jpg), disgustedly calls OP an asshole for crying rape and then bluntly tells OP:

&gt;You made a bunch of shitty decisions and got a predictably shitty result. And you are trying to turn this into some sort of men's rights, reverse sexism manifesto. If any of this is true, which I doubt, go tell your parents the whole story, just like you've posted it here. Maybe it's not too late for them to turn you into a decent, functional human being.

OP gets defensive, responding to the ""shitty decisions"" comment with ""?????????????????? Such as what?"" and Smitty lays him out with a 10-point bulleted list of where OP went wrong. OP then argues with one of his points, claiming that it wasn't true in all caps exasperation, and Smitty simply points out that OP is proving his point about OP's immaturity. 

/u/urbanexotic also [jumps onto](http://i.imgur.com/5MXbR.jpg) the ""let's call OP an asshole"" bandwagon, calling out OP for being childish and wishing that ""she'd have hit you a bit more."" 

This seems to strike a nerve in OP, and he seethes:

&gt;**Wow. Another man-hating sexist cunt.** Again, see if you'd tell a girl you wish she had been hit harder by her boyfriend. I mean get a fucking grip.

**BONUS DRAMA - added 9/24 10:33AM** 

/u/jxln tells OP that he/she won't even bother to read his diatribe, to which OP vitriolically spits: [""get fucked sexist cunt""](http://i.imgur.com/Hhea4.jpg).  They then go back and forth in insulting each other. 

mademoiselle_B also makes another appearance here, too, calling bullshit on OP's story again and causing him to exasperatedly exclaim: ""un be fucking liveable"". Moiselle then calls OP a neanderthal and they bicker back and forth.


**Final Thoughts**

Was OP just an MRA/anti-feminist troll/woman beater, or was he a victim of a mentally unstable girlfriend's rage? Either way, there is tons of popcorn to be had in his post. 

Thanks for reading, folks!

**EDIT** As a side note, I started this thread early in the day on Sunday and didn't finish until late at night due to distractions and generally going-about-my-life stuff. As such, I didn't see [this other SRD post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/10cqa5/rrelationships_post_about_being_hit_by_gf/) about the same drama, and I apologize for unintentionally double-posting it.

When asked for an explanation it appears /u/istilllkeme is talking about himself! He's been shadowbanned twice!
  
You can read istilllkeme's account of what went down [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1j48g9/6_of_american_adults_use_reddit_number_is/cbb3kml), or you can read the direct quote:

&gt;First I got shadowbanned for asking about investors behind reddit in [this thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1if813/introducing_manualreddit_upvote_your_world_with/cb3vl8q). [These](http://minus.com/mu7HzwZpC3cRi?context=3) were the comments that got my oldest and dearest accounts (some as old as six years) banned. Erik Martin tries to claim [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1ii527/here_is_the_place_to_discuss_rpolitics_removal/cb4s2mk?context=3) that he shadowbanned me for vote cheating in the /r/blog thread, which is not true and he provided no evidence. 
&gt;
Then, two days later after hearing nothing more on why I had all my accounts shadowbanned, I got Erik to promise he wouldn't ban me for my opinion [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1ii527/here_is_the_place_to_discuss_rpolitics_removal/cb58wp7?context=3) and I agreed that I would break no rules.
&gt;
After agreeing to not shadowban me anymore for my opinion he did it again for [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1ivwmw/uyudi332_shadowbannedmysteriously_disappeared/cb8t3p6?context=3) comment, without any explanation that time. And now I'm on this account.
&gt;
This has all happened in the past 8 days and it all started because I started pressing on who the investors were behind reddit inc and I have proof that an admin has used certain groups of people on this site to spam for a holding profile of a certain group of resturants. That evidence is peppered throughout my examples and Erik has refused to comment on that evidence, even after [asking me to further clarify what I was showing him](http://np.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1izp95/this_was_posted_yesterday_but_quickly_buried_by/cba0k2i?context=3).
  
He's basically provided ready access to the meat of the drama by the links within his story. So there's not too much else I need to say. There's probably more to this drama if you poke around. In the interest of promoting neutrality I'd like point out the obvious: it's a conspiracy theory so take it with a pinch of salt and enjoy the drama.

**UPDATE: And then shit got real.**

/u/david-me found some crazy additional content which I have posted below. Before you read it, I think I speak for him, me, and especially the mods and most everyone else here when I say this young woman does not deserve to be witch hunted.  She is young and dumb, like we all have been, and she does not respond to criticism well, just like the rest of us. 

So put yourself in her shoes and realize she's not going to respond perfectly to withering criticism, she's young and she's just trying to do her best. 

**Please do not form a bravery jerk and try to ""put her in her place"" either on reddit or on YouTube. Just watch in amusement and eat popcorn, keep the jerk in this thread.**

Edit 1: 

* An hour ago she just posted a new video in which a 2 year old is muzzle swept by a shotgun that is laying half off a table for a full 7 seconds.  At one point the child stares down the barrel of the gun.   [/r/firearms does not find this amusing.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Firearms/comments/1f29o8/great_grandaddys_shotgun/) 

It is now several hours later, she has flipped out, and she's been shadowbanned. 

After being asked whether she realized she muzzle swept the kid, she states:

&gt;Hey Liberal anti gun nut! Guns do NOT shoot people! People shoot people! So do you think an unloaded gun is somehow going to magically jump up load itself and then shoot someone??? Is that something that you heard on MSNBC could happen??? You Obama voters kill me!! Just saying :)

After being corrected on the four rules of gun safety, she then states she is smarter than 95% of the people on reddit:

&gt;Those rules are AWESOME however they only apply to guns in YOUR Possession! Basic general rules of safe gun handling imply's that you are HANDLING the gun!! As in the GUN is in YOUR HANDS!!! NOT laying on a freaking table!!!! MY GOD!!! How much of this retardation do I need to deal with in this life???????? **I'm an 18 year old girl and I seem to me smarter than 95% of the people on reddit!!! FUUUUK!**

/u/Cdwollan bends over backward to try to put her in the right direction.  She responds by calling him a retard. Repeatedly. 

&gt;Retard!! Watch the freaking video I showed the gun to be unloaded and it was laying on a flipping table two feet from me and it's trigger! At no time was that child in danger you flipping Jack Ass!!! BTW that table is it's home so suck it!

Finally, she justifies everything in terms of reddit being full of trolls. While I can hardly be one to say that it's not, I can actually point to excellent YouTube gun channels by redditors who I watch (and otherwise have *deep* disagreements with over gun policy) but I leave alone because the content is just clearly good and no fault can be found with it, unlike her superficial channel. 

One excellent example is ""Ryan's Range Report"" by /u/dieselgeek. [You can find it here, I encourage you to check it out, he's always been good, he has really stepped up his game over the last year. ](http://www.youtube.com/user/DallasfuckingTT?feature=watch)

 &gt;I only get trolled on reddit in fact if you go to my YouTube channel you will see that this video like all my videos is being well received! I have 4500 Subscribers and 241,400 views on my videos and 8623 LIKES and 989 DISLIKES 10,566 Comments 490 Shares 181 FAVORITED!!! So lets keep it real!! The FACT is that reddit is full of TROLLS!!! I will admit that I do not deal well with trolls and as a young girl I tend to feel the need to fight hard and take no shit! BUT the numbers do not lie and any smart person can see that it is what it is and I an NOT the problem!

She thinks gay people are freaks.

&gt;Get your ass back to Brokeback Mountain Freak!!

Again, this will justifiably make you angry. Just vent about it in this thread and keep it here. 

Edit 2:

* She has another alt sock account where she has been trying to post her videos on reddit. She even posted them to a satirical gun sub which I shall not name thinking it was the proper place for them (I actually had removed one over a month ago). That is pretty embarrassing, but what makes it really cringy is that she constantly refers to herself in the third person as a ""hot chick"" and is using both accounts to respond to redditors in the same thread. 

Like when a user tried to give her genuinely constructive criticism and she posted this on her alt (now she's on both accounts in the same thread):

&gt;""Bad nunchuck video"" WOW you are a real peace of work! Krysta my advice is to disregard anything from this troll! Much like in life **he does not rate talking to a girl like you! LOL!!** [Link](http://np.reddit.com/r/taekwondo/comments/1e7bmu/how_to_use_nunchucks_level_1_basic_weapon_skills/c9yp5kj?context=3%0AThis%20one%20is%20embarrassing)

Prominent feminist atheists (Atheism Plus crowd) are accusing prominent non-feminist atheists of rape/sexual assault/harassment, with no evidence as far as I can tell, and anonymous secondhand accusations.  

In this specific case, the person accusing someone of being a rapist is simply passing on a secondhand account of someone else who said they were raped.

EDIT: Wow, that thread is over 1700 comments now! The shit is really hitting the fan here. Here is more goodies:

1)*I believe this is how any mass delusion has started: some person(s) think they know better, somehow get in charge, creates rules to spread their ideology, unifies followers in some sort of community, aggressively goes against other opinions to stay in charge, and now tell me that’s not exactly what the new mods did?
** I WONT BE A PART OF THIS. ***

2) *Reddit has been given the Digg treatment. RIP Reddit 6/13/13.*

3) *The shitstorm this is gonna cause when people in the U.S finally see it after the morning routines. I'm 100% sure of it now mods are ignoring all dissenters and just trolling us at this point.

[Skeen](/user/skeen), the founder and top moderator of [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) had been derelict in his modship duties.  As such, he was removed of his mod rights via a request to the admins by moderator [Jij](/user/jij).  

Soon after, Jij ~~, now the top mod,~~ added a rule to reduce the number of image posts on the front page and improve the content mix: direct link image posts are not allowed, but links to images in self-posts are.  The rule denies karma to users posting images, and makes the opening of image posts a little more clunky (2-clicks vs. 1-click).  

To put it lightly, a group of people have been vocally protesting this change.  One of the methods of protest has been to camp out in /r/atheism/new and downvote everything other than complaints, thereby breaking the sub.  This method yielded an amazing front page last Sunday, when every single post was a complaint (if anyone has an image I can link to, I would appreciate it!).  In the face of this onslaught, Jij made a post suggesting he was ready to concede.  

But then today, [a few new things](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1g4b53/psa_a_small_group_of_users_3040_are_currently/) happened:

* Moderator [tuber](/user/tuber) added more mods to /r/atheism, increasing the number of mods from 2 (post-skeen) to ~~10~~ 17.  
* Complaints about the new rule are temporarily banned in r/atheism.  Users wanting to vent are being directed to [/r/atheismpolicy](/r/atheismpolicy).
* The mods said flat out that the r/atheism rules will not change so long as people are trying to sabotage the sub.  

Having lost their outlet, the complainers have channeled their anger at [/r/atheismrebooted](/r/atheismrebooted), a schism sub created soon after the new rule was put in place.

**[/R/ATHEISMREBOOTED](/r/atheismrebooted) GEMS**

&gt; I allowed myself to get usurped through ignorance and foolish trust, and now the sub is in the hands of power-drunk morons. 

--[Skeen](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismrebooted/comments/1g46hz/banned_from_ratheism/cagkkwk)

&gt; Doxing is about the only thing we can do. Death threads are a bad thing and are not acceptable in any way. But if you destroy an online community you should at least expect that you get doxed. It does not hurt you much but a society without the ability to punish does not work. We are perfectly powerless so we need to do everything we can.

http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/utfp8/i_dont_do_it_for_you_i_dont_do_it_for_society_i/

All the usual feminist arguments showed up - 2X regulars told her the reason she felt good wearing makeup was because society told her she should wear it, she disagreed, etc, etc. Nothing terribly unusual. Then someone posted it to SRS.

They start circlejerking about how this argument is misogynistic, that it's all the fault of /r/MensRights and male invaders, etc - apparently completely oblivious to the fact that they're blaming a really ancient feminist argument on male MRA invaders.

Some of you may be familiar with the virtual pet website, www.neopets.com. There is a subreddit for that: /r/neopets. Recently, /u/nowits created /r/neopia, intended to be a more specialized discussion space where people can go to get help or advice regarding Neopets. 

**The Drama**

Nowits has an apparent distaste for r/neopets moderator /u/fuzio, preemptively banning him from r/neopia immediately after its creation. 

When Nowits makes a thread in r/neopets advertising r/neopia, he [is immediately called out for banning Fuzio](http://np.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/1a3kbh/hey_i_just_created_rneopia_last_week_its_designed/c8u9y46?context=4). 

**The Drama in the Drama** (*yo dawg*)

To justify his actions, Nowits [digs up this thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/y029q/lets_have_another_bragging_thread_reddit/c5r53vy?context=1) from *seven months ago* featuring Fuzio having a spat with a different user, /u/Lupevs. In this argument, both Fuzio and Lupevs accuse the other of [taking things too seriously](http://np.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/y029q/lets_have_another_bragging_thread_reddit/c5riplo) while writing up [long responses](http://np.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/y029q/lets_have_another_bragging_thread_reddit/c5rj4hs) to argue with each other over the internet on a forum about an internet game whose primary userbase is tweenage girls. 

The whole thing is worth a skim, even if it does in the end [descend into even pettier territory with ""my real life is better than yours"" syndrome](http://np.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/y029q/lets_have_another_bragging_thread_reddit/c5r8ed7). 


This aged thread is literally full of people calling Fuzio a [dick](http://np.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/y029q/lets_have_another_bragging_thread_reddit/c5rdw9c), or a [douchebag](http://np.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/y029q/lets_have_another_bragging_thread_reddit/c5rke0c), or a [douchebag again](http://np.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/y029q/lets_have_another_bragging_thread_reddit/c5rlic2). 

**Back Up One Level**

If we return to the original thread after that tasty detour, we find that [nowits is now banned](http://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/1a3kbh/hey_i_just_created_rneopia_last_week_its_designed/c8uamcs) from r/neopets! (Edit: He was quickly unbanned.)

Fuzio then writes [a long rambling comment containing lots of information of questionable relevancy](http://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/1a3kbh/hey_i_just_created_rneopia_last_week_its_designed/c8udiaf) that doesn't really prove much of anything, except that maybe he still takes himself just a little too seriously.

1335999965.0,190,self.SubredditDrama,t448n,[Meta] The 'Laurelai' Scale: Proposed revamp and standardization,BecomingMolly,254,64,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/t448n/meta_the_laurelai_scale_proposed_revamp_and/,"I've been thinking that the Laurelai scale needs to be re-thought a bit. It was mentioned in another meta thread that the Saydrah drama was larger than the Laurelai drama. Now, our standard for ""shitstorm"" cap would probably be based on the Saydrah model, while the ""drama"" of day to day would fit better on a ""Laurelai"" scale. So, what I propose, is that we scrap the current measurement of La and replace it with a system similar to metric.

Under this system, 10 Laurelai (La) would be equal to 1 Saydrah (Sa). 1 Sa being a reddit-wide shitstorm the size of Saydrahgate. This would roughly put the /r/lgbt drama at about 5 La.

You're probably wondering ""Molly, why is 1 La a smaller measurement then the LGBT drama itself?"" The answer I keep coming back to is that the LGBT drama has involved about 5 people that were as big of dramallamas as Laurelai herself (SilentAgony, Rmuser, RobotAnna, Laurelai, MaterialDesigner) thus far. The hypothesis here is that if we were to ever have drama that has 10 separate Laurelai-worthy dramallamas, then it would hit critical mass and be as large as the Saydrah incident.
Here's an example scale

1 Sa - Reddit-wide drama equivalent to Saydrah. This could also include front page incidents such as the banning of /r/jailbait or the Woody Harrelson AMA

9 La - /r/Marijuana vs /r/trees.

8 La - The SRS Fempire in general.

7 La - Witchhunts involving multiple major subreddits.

6 La - Major subreddit witchhunts.

5 La - The /r/LGBT drama as of May 2012

4 La - Multi-sub witchhunts (Non-major subs)

3 La - /r/MensRights on an average day.

2 La - Small subreddit contained witchhunts.

1 La - A single mod losing their shit.

.5 La - Someone has mildly rustled jimmies. Perhaps due to a troll.

0 La - Buisness as usual. No drama.

As you can see, the scale is mostly based on people affected, and average number of jimmies rustled. This prevents preference being given to particularly interesting drama and bases the scientific scale as a measure of drama spread. This would nessecitate a new measurement and scale for intensity per rustled jimmies though.

**Edit: The Jimmy Rustle Index, or JRI**

On suggestion of ArchangelleXerxes, I've come up with the following system for grading intensity of drama, modeled after hurricanes.

Jimmy Rustle Index (JRI)

Category 1 - Intentionally humorous drama. Only the very stupid would mistake it for serious drama. Entertaining nonetheless. (/r/pickle vs. /r/banana)

Category 2 - Someone is clearly trolling, and most people get it, but a small percentage of jimmies are being rustled. Hard.

Category 3 - Slap-fight has broken out. This can be the result of a troll, or simply an argument. Brace for logical fallacy and privilege arguments.

Category 4 - Bans are now involved. SRS has probably posted about it. Shit has come in contact with fans.

Category 5 - Theoretical perfect storm. The equivalent of the elusive (actual) [10] in /r/trees. 

-------------

Only combining the terms, do we get a full measure of the drama's spread and severity. For a tangible example, the /r/lgbt drama would be described as ""5.0 La with a JRI of Cat. 4"".",,False,self,t5_2ss5b,True,,,True,t3_t448n,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/t448n/meta_the_laurelai_scale_proposed_revamp_and/,

Once upon a time there was a game called Arma 2:combined operations and for that game there was a mod that went by the name of Day Z. The Day Z mod was phenomenally successful and made Bohemia Interactive, the company that developed it, vasts amounts of money. So much money that they decide to create a stand alone version of the game.

And then Hammerpoint Interactive decided that they wanted to create a similar game by the name of the War Z  and as soon as everyone heard the news people started saying  that it was an enormous rip off. That they where simply trying to cash in on the success of Day Z and that they even had a similar name as Day Z. This is backed up by [images comparing War Z with War Inc](http://imgur.com/a/ZSf5V) (which was the previous game Hammerpoint Interactive had released.) [Reddit post](http://redd.it/ygwyw)


The controversy started when one of the [WarZ producers call players faggots for camping](http://uk.gamespot.com/news/the-war-z-producer-calls-campers-fgots-6398729), the exact quote being

Next came the revelation that the [War Z copy pastes terms of service from League of Legends](http://i.imgur.com/EBOr7.jpg). [Reddit post.](http://redd.it/11jk83)


Followed by an update where the developers forced people to [pay 750 gold coin to create a clan.](http://redd.it/13wuol) [Twitter link.](https://twitter.com/The_War_Z/status/273604251639500800)


Then there were claims by a former moderator that his account had been hacked and that the [company are going to abandon the game](http://i.imgur.com/62kg1.jpg) in 6 months if they don't get enough revenue from it. He also said that the company was banning random accounts to get people to rebuy the game, that there was a massive problem with hacking and that the game is a direct port from war inc. [Reddit post.](http://redd.it/13xv00)

[Turns out most of this was lies,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Svd-p3-CURk) (except that his accout actually was hacked) and that he just said that because he was mad at being demodded after the hacker used his account and deleted his posts. [Reddit post.](http://redd.it/149ntp) Sergey Titov makes a post on the WarZ forums say that they [had been considering legal action.](http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?71253-Regarding-Devin-our-ex-moderator)

The drama was further escalated when one player experienced problems with the game, and he asked for a refund only to be told that the game was currently in beta and if a refund is given [they would be put on a global ban list.](http://imgur.com/t6F9c)


Its also worth noting at this point that the Executive Producer, Sergey Titov also happens to be behind the production of [big rigs,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f3HDsgLV68) possible one of the worst games ever made. So bad that its meta critic score [is 8 out of 100.](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing)

After that there was a heavily [upvoted post](http://redd.it/151f1d) on /r/gaming say that the [developers lied about many of the games features.](http://i.imgur.com/j9Q3f.jpg)

Meanwhile there is much argueing on the [steam forum.](http://i.imgur.com/Pi3my.png) [Reddit post.](http://redd.it/150iso)

Popular youtuber Total Biscuits then makes a [video about the WarZ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtKAm3nzg6I), if I was to summarize it briefly I would say that he completely ripped the shit out of it. Of his many complaints about the game the most prominent were

* It looked ugly and had low texture quality
* That the ability to buy in game items for real world cash was ethically questionable and went against the idea of a zombie survival game.
* The game itself was as boring as hell.

/u/Bromazepam points out in the comments that there is something horribly wrong with the reflections when he spots the reflection of [a flash light in the water.](http://i.imgur.com/TEdi2.jpg)
Later comfirmed by [this](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=114076844) post on the steam forums.

Total Biscuit later uploaded an [update about the WarZ affair](http://youtu.be/3IQrhrooSOY?t=1m25s) the next day.


/u/IAmFluffey [makes a reddit post](http://redd.it/152tbh) stating that the WarZ has updated its game so that it's even more of a money grab. You now have to wait four hours instead of one for one of your characters to respawn and there is an option for you to pay real money to buy back into the game. They also forced you to sign a TOS which disallows refunds.


Someone starts a [petition to remove on steam](http://steamcommunity.com/app/226700/discussions/0/828925849084337399/) with over a thousand comments in it.


Developers do an [interview with game spy](http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-war-z/1226980p1.html?utm_campaign=twposts&amp;utm_source=twitter) in which he tries to defend the game and it's lack of features. (Spoiler, he fails). Highlights from this interview include such phrases as

&gt;Let's be frank: when you read ""up to 100 players"" -- what does it mean to you personally? I mean, for me it doesn't mean that I will play with 99 other players. Really :)

As well as

&gt;There's no such thing as ""Release"" for an online game.

He then makes a [forum post](http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?79251-Steam-purchase-page-issues) in which he blames customers for misreading the steam page.


Now what do you do when people start criticizer you, you resort to censorship because that the one thing that the internet really loves. The developers start to [remove comments/threads from the steam forums.](http://redd.it/152wwp) [Valve has to step in to sort things out.](http://steamcommunity.com/app/226700/discussions/0/828925849078277433/)


Rhino crunch posts a [video stating the game is a scam](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXKu5lV69V8) and that the developers lied.

* He says that the game was only in development recently when it had been previously stated that it had been in development for years.
* He also claims that the game is nothing more than a mod and that they pulled people from War inc to make WarZ
* He was then blocked from there twitter after trying to confront them.

Rhinocrunch later made another review in which he bacisally says [I told you so.](http://youtu.be/BUrKdAjN4DM)

The game is finally [removed from steam.](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/12/19/the-war-z-no-longer-available-on-steam/)

Valve then offers people that have brought the game a refund and issued a statement say:

&gt;From time to time a mistake can be made and one was made by prematurely issuing a copy of War Z for sale via Steam. We apologize for this and have temporary removed the sale offering of the title until we have time to work with the developer and have confidence in a new build. Those who purchase the game and wish to continue playing it via Steam may do so. Those who purchased the title via Steam and are unhappy with what they received may seek a refund by creating a ticket at our support site [here.](https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php)

All this drama surrounding the game currently has resulted in it being given a [meta critic rating of 1.1](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-war-z) dispite the developers asking people [to vote for them](http://forums.thewarz.com/showthread.php?79039-War-Z-on-metacritic-tell-us-what-do-you-think-!).


Sergey Titov does an [interview](http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/20/the-war-z-interview-sergey-titov-backlash/) with PC gamer in which he talks about the problems the game has had and what has caused them. He all say the game has almost 700,000 players.

Today around noon a random /r/canada user created a thread titled 
&gt;[In the interest of transparency, could a list of banned users from r/Canada be made public?](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/wa91h/in_the_interest_of_transparency_could_a_list_of/)

[Someone was able to take pic of the thread right before it was all deleted](http://i.imgur.com/FHecc.png)

This thread was doing good, it gained about 60 upvotes and went up to be one of the top 5 links on /r/canada. 

Around 4 hours after the thread was created a mod came in to delete all the comments AND BANNED EVERYONE that participated in the thread (though to be fair the mod did keep any comment that supported the mods). 

Its been almost 4 hours after the thread deletion and /r/canada mods are currently stalking the new tab and deleting any post that mentions the banning's or asks about them. 

So far no one that's been banned has received an answer [except for one](http://i.imgur.com/49T7S.jpg).


/r/metacanada decided to counter this by spamming /r/canadas comments with a link to the thread and the pic to try and create some awareness. 

[A new thread was also created in /r/WTF to try and bring awareness](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/wb0x6/wtf_mods_of_rcanada_deleted_and_banned_everyone/) telling everyone about what happened. 


I guess this entire thing will either die down or explode with another witch hunt. 

More to come hopefully! 


Edit: Overnight a user created a [new thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/wbcks/well_ill_hate_to_get_banned_but_the_time_has_come/) that hit second place in /r/Canada.  This one had over 100 comments!

Why BEP, someone who doesn't post here much any-more and pretty much only pops in to clean a spamqueue every now and then just did what he did.

I got a few complaints through PM by SRD users I recognised as being here a while (yes, I do keep track of things like that mentally). So I had a look. I saw mods bickering in public, something I detest. If mods decide on something, they should do it in the best interest of the subreddit and then stick to that; in the face of opposition they should perhaps review the decision and pull it out [no-one's perfect]. 

But arguing in public gives the impression we are so fractured that not even our janitors can keep it together. We all know we have a problem of downmodding stuff linked here. I had an idea brought to me by /u/eternalkerri that I'd like your thoughts on:

&gt; All drama linked here must be at least 24 hours old in age from the start of the drama

This way we can ensure that most of the drama has already *happened*. What're your thoughts? 

Oh, and who'd be up for a vote on not only the mods below me but also me staying on as a failsafe in case this happens again (which is, incidentally, why I came on mostly in the first place. Also, *dem spamqueues*)?

This subreddit is based on mature in-depth analysis and debate of the books and show. Today would have been a pretty big day for the subreddit, as the third season of the TV show has premiered today. However, the mods decided to have a bit of fun instead. 

[Three days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1b85i6/crow_business_yes_folks_we_know_about_the/), the mods tried to kickstart some rumours in a rather obvious attempt to set up the joke.

[Their first post of the day](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1be9an/major_spoilers_twow_spoilers_crow_business_super/) was about how they got to read some pre-release chapters of the newest books in the series. People get excited. The mods then make some fairly unremarkable claims concerning the story development. Despite some claims contradicting eachother, people see no reason as of yet to doubt the story. 

[Suddenly!](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1bf07m/crow_business_why_i_didnt_participate_in_the/) One of the mods stages an internal conflict and makes a thread where she harshly calls out the other mods, because she 'disagrees' with them reading the pre-release chapters. Understandably, the /r/asoiaf users aren't in on the joke and side with her or the other mods, and have a few nasty flamewars.

[Finally](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1bf8pq/crow_business_happy_april_fools_everybody/), the mods admit it was all a big happy April Fools joke. People are *not amused*, get angry at the mods, make new subreddits and promise to unsubscribe. 

[Epilogue](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1bflpf/no_spoilers_about_the_mod_joke/): A thread is posted trying to calm people down. People continue argueing in said thread.

And the inevitable [why do Americans love violence and why are they so sex-negative?](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/x3z5i/i_love_skyrim_mods/c5j27iz)

But the best part is when [somebody brings up OP's broniness and anti-American, anti-capitalist post history](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/x3z5i/i_love_skyrim_mods/c5j1xcc?context=2).

1376072728.0,175,self.SubredditDrama,1k1hbt,[Recap] A failure in peer review enrages /r/chemistry,twilly13,223,48,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1k1hbt/recap_a_failure_in_peer_review_enrages_rchemistry/,"/r/chemistry has been an interesting place this week, as a post from a user led to real life repercussions for a scientist publishing their PhD thesis. Intellectual nerd drama has fed the subreddit for two days now. 

The drama began two days ago, when /u/iostream posted [a link to a paper](http://np.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1jv3q1/check_out_page_12_of_the_supporting_info/) with [a questionable statement](http://i.imgur.com/VGnEooo.jpg) within its supplemental information section. [Some people](http://np.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1jv3q1/check_out_page_12_of_the_supporting_info/cbiunoc) are mad that such a thing could get past the reviewers. Some have a laugh about it. 

Then comes the next day, when [the story is picked up by a chemistry blog](http://np.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1jyu7k/a_disturbing_note_in_a_recent_supplemental/). The growing amount of attention around the story cause the journal where it is getting published to [halt its publication](http://np.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1jyu7k/a_disturbing_note_in_a_recent_supplemental/cbjpiw4) pending further review. The [top](http://np.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1jyu7k/a_disturbing_note_in_a_recent_supplemental/cbjnmug) [few](http://np.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1jyu7k/a_disturbing_note_in_a_recent_supplemental/cbjmw5uhttp://np.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1jyu7k/a_disturbing_note_in_a_recent_supplemental/cbjmw5u) comments are no longer joking. 

The same blog conducts a closer inspection of the paper, which leads to [further discrepancies](http://np.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1k0qcf/discrepancies_between_problematic_organometallics/). An accusation of [witch hunting](http://np.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1k0qcf/discrepancies_between_problematic_organometallics/cbk7269) is thrown out in the comments. 

Meanwhile, Another blog reaches out to the author. [The author's response is stickied at the top by the mods.](http://np.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1jzjvo/reto_dorta_responds_to_an_email_inquiry_regarding/). The author admits to minor numbering errors, but claims it was largely a misunderstanding. As it stands, the paper is currently being withheld from the print publication queue. 

May not have a fabulous slapfight in the comments, but its the best /r/chemistry has ever seen. 


UPDATE: The American Chemical Society (the head honchos of chemistry, so to speak) has [weighed in on the issue](http://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/1k1k57/usually_we_link_to_the_acs_not_the_other_way/), including a a link back to the original thread.

**Background**

For those who don't know, ""shibes"" started out as pictures of Shiba Inu dogs with comic sans superimposed over them like [this](http://imgur.com/bDYFSnV). The trend started on the [Shiba Confessions] (http://shibaconfessions.tumblr.com/) Tumblr and got some [Buzzfeed attention](http://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanhatesthis/shiba-confessions-is-your-new-favorite-thing) back in September of 2012. 

A little over a week later, /u/devtesla posted the first [shibe to /r/SRSFunny](http://np.reddit.com/r/SRSFunny/comments/10jlmx/knowdlege_dag/), and subsequent ones [were also well received](http://np.reddit.com/r/SRSFunny/comments/10yl7s/me_irl/). That November, he [made a ShibeGen](http://np.reddit.com/r/SRSFunny/comments/13yzsw/shibegen_its_happening/) and then went ahead and made /r/shibe the next day. [This was his first post there](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/141gvv/marx_shibe/). 

During its short life, /r/shibe became fairly popular, accruing 4,848 readers as of its shutdown today.

**""FEMINISM IS AWESOME AND BY POSTING HERE YOU AGREE TO BE MISANDERED""**

On March 15, /u/devtesla [made /r/shibe a text-only subreddit](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1abj9a/how_to_text_shibe/), later [admitting in his personal subreddit that](http://np.reddit.com/r/devtesla/comments/1abk8t/yes_the_change_to_text_posts_on_r_shibe_is/)

&gt;yes the change to text posts on r shibe is intended to kill the sub lol

or at least to ""stop drive by redditors from posting"" because he hated their post history and thought they weren't funny. 

A week later [devtesla updates his personal sub's subscribers on his experiment](http://np.reddit.com/r/devtesla/comments/1at8os/well_text_post_didnt_scare_away_the_shitlords_lol/), letting them know that it ""didn't scare away the shitlords lol"" and that he was instead adding a header that read

&gt;FEMINISM IS AWESOME AND BY POSTING HERE YOU AGREE TO BE MISANDERED

He also lets /r/shibe know that [he's started banning people](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1avorc/banned_someone_here_is_their_responce/) for making ""rape jokes"". 

In April, [/u/Dogmantra makes a post in /r/devtesla](http://np.reddit.com/r/devtesla/comments/1bp8w8/all_this_north_korea_shit_on_rshibe/) asking if all the North Korean shibes were racist. [devtesla disgrees](http://np.reddit.com/r/devtesla/comments/1bp8w8/all_this_north_korea_shit_on_rshibe/c994b5h) while /u/mmultiplier notes:

&gt;I looked some of the comment herstories for the users and they definitely had shitlord comments

However, /u/CaptainComedy [disagrees](http://np.reddit.com/r/devtesla/comments/1bp8w8/all_this_north_korea_shit_on_rshibe/c996pme), exclaiming:

&gt;This is idiotic. It isn't automatically racist to make fun of North Korea unless you actually say something racially insensitive. Nobody's on there going ""wow, eyes so squinty,"" so I really do not understand the problem.

He gets banned for ""being a racist"".

On April 7, devtesla posts [a screenshot of an interaction between him and a banned /r/Shibe submitter](http://i.imgur.com/4ebfFuJ.png), complaining to /r/SRSMailbag that ["" these are the kind of people who post to r shibe :/""](http://np.reddit.com/r/SRSMailbag/comments/1btutb/r_shibe_modmail_these_are_the_kind_of_people_who/). 

In the message, devtesla mocks the submitter for modding /r/fatpeoplestories, then lets him know that he was banned for using ""retarded as a pejorative"".

**""I think a better idea would be to just remove r shibe lol""**

A few days later, [/u/queercoffee makes a post to the devtesla sub](http://np.reddit.com/r/devtesla/comments/1c7wla/is_it_possible_to_remove_commenting_in_rshibe/) asking users if there was a way devtesla could disable commenting on /r/shibe because ""that would improve the sub a lot imo."" One responder suggests banning everyone, while devtesla himself [suggests](http://np.reddit.com/r/devtesla/comments/1c7wla/is_it_possible_to_remove_commenting_in_rshibe/c9ek1cn)

&gt;I think a better idea would be to just remove r shibe lol

devtesla's shibe-related activity then remains fairly low-key for the next few weeks, with him only posting a few shibes and [thanking a user for the sub's new CSS](http://www.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1cpdbd/thank_u_based_t3hcoolness/).


**""hahahahahaha oh wow shutting down r shibe forever""**

On April 26, devtesla announced [he was shutting down /r/shibe](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1d4p5f/hahahahahaha_oh_wow_shutting_down_r_shibe_forever/) by making it an ""approved submitters only"" sub. He used a [x-post from /r/cringe](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1d3aqz/found_this_on_rcringe_it_needed_to_be_brought_to/) as his reason, then laughed and told his subscribers to ""complain in the comments lol"".

Users are furious with devtesla, with many wondering (in shibe-speak) [why devtesla couldn't have done something less extreme instead of shutting down the entire sub](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1d4p5f/hahahahahaha_oh_wow_shutting_down_r_shibe_forever/c9mxzkg), while others were  [spreading word of a new alternative](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1d4p5f/hahahahahaha_oh_wow_shutting_down_r_shibe_forever/c9mv2v8) free from devtesla's moderation.

/u/GET_GULLY doesn't mince words when [voicing his displeasure](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1d4p5f/hahahahahaha_oh_wow_shutting_down_r_shibe_forever/c9n25om), angrily writing:

&gt;So instead of just deleting the post you close the whole sub? You SRS retards are fucked.

This brings the devtesla-supporters out of the woodwork, with /u/Dogmantra telling GET_GULLY that ""you're why we can't have nice things"" and /u/curious_electric [mocking him in a text-shibe](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1d4p5f/hahahahahaha_oh_wow_shutting_down_r_shibe_forever/c9n4t35). The two end up sparring, with [GULLY telling electric](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1d4p5f/hahahahahaha_oh_wow_shutting_down_r_shibe_forever/c9n6ifz) to 

&gt;Go outside you socially inept shithead

/u/Fake_Unicron also [voices disbelief](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1d4p5f/hahahahahaha_oh_wow_shutting_down_r_shibe_forever/c9n0e8q) at devtesla's decision, sighing

&gt;Wow ""reluctantly"" hosted on reddit? Fucking SRS makes my head hurt. Bye now.

/u/0x_ comments [that he'd only been subbed for a day](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1d4p5f/hahahahahaha_oh_wow_shutting_down_r_shibe_forever/c9n1oxt), and in that short period he had many of his posts/comments removed due to ""mod drama."" This also pisses off curious_electric, who [tells him to ""get over[him]self""](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1d4p5f/hahahahahaha_oh_wow_shutting_down_r_shibe_forever/c9n6bk5) and gets showered in upvotes for it.

Out of the 81 comments, only /u/IgnusMcStab ends up [openly approving](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1d4p5f/hahahahahaha_oh_wow_shutting_down_r_shibe_forever/c9n6z0c) of devtesla's shutting down /r/shibe.


A sad /u/room23 also [asks devtesla why](http://np.reddit.com/r/shibe/comments/1d4p5f/hahahahahaha_oh_wow_shutting_down_r_shibe_forever/c9mvpf1) he made this decision, to which he responds that 

&gt;idk why shitlords post here I kno it's p sad.

In response, /u/s_med asks why he doesn't simply make rules and ban violators and is ignored, 0x_ tries to comfort devtesla:

&gt;I am OK with sticking by the unspoken rules i just learned about yesterday (at the time i only knew VI. HAVE FUN) and to not in future post anything that would not be acceptable within a Safe Space. I guess i should have recognised the Roman Numeral rules box from SRS before posting...

curious_electric claims to have ""some pretty bad stuff posted (worse than this)"" , and /u/ItsJustNigel argues that it's up to the community to decide what's a ""good post"" and what's not. This makes Dogmantra appear again, arguing that ""no, the community is awful"".

ItsJustNigel tries to make the point that the community is so dedicated to shibe that they even do text Shibes in the comments now, to which Dogmantra laughs:

&gt;lol

**And so ends /r/shibe's 4-month run as a sub.**

Programmers scramble to disagree.,Epistaxis,230,58,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/19l621/facebook_engineer_recommends_websites_to_learn/,"Today's tale comes to us from /r/AskReddit.

Q: ""How can a person with zero experience begin to learn basic programming?""

[A:](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19krxl/how_can_a_person_with_zero_experience_begin_to/c8oy4yi)

&gt; I am an engineer at Facebook, I didn't know anything about coding 2 years ago. I'm 24. (I'm not sure how to give proof to the mods, but PM me and I will).

&gt; ...

&gt; Doing all of this will take you between 2 weeks and 2 months depending on how much you do each day.

But the website OC recommends is [apparently the wrong website](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19krxl/how_can_a_person_with_zero_experience_begin_to/c8oycbk?context=1):

&gt; Please don't recommend W3 schools. It's not affiliated with the W3C, the tutorials are bad, the advice is awful and there are glaring errors.

And others pile on. 

&gt; [That's absolutely absurd. Essentially you are saying that people can learn what are sometimes (often, in this case) the incorrect ways of doing things because they can revert those habits later?](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19krxl/how_can_a_person_with_zero_experience_begin_to/c8oz3tl?context=2)

&gt; [StackOverflow is full of people who learn vulnerable and bad PHP from W3Schools and others. Please don't add to the problem.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19krxl/how_can_a_person_with_zero_experience_begin_to/c8oz9u7?context=2)

&gt; [Couldn't disagree more. Better resources exist. Why would you point to the inferior one?](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19krxl/how_can_a_person_with_zero_experience_begin_to/c8ozirs?context=2)

etc.

[Some](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19krxl/how_can_a_person_with_zero_experience_begin_to/c8oyyuf?context=1) think OC is a shill:

&gt; honestly his entire post seems like a marketing plug for Lynda.com

Others question his/her credentials:

&gt; [I'm not a mod, but a front-end with 12+ years of experience and you have no idea what you're talking about. Even if you work for FB they should fire you immediately.

(Remember when Destiny's Twitter got compromised? Yeah, that was during the last MLG.) 

Well, the Major League Gaming Pro Circuit stopped in Dallas this past weekend, sending the /r/starcraft drama mill into high gear. Here's a recap of the latest drama from the world of professional Starcraft. 
***
**Caster Drama**

Caster (commentator) Marcus “djWHEAT” Graham is forced to leave MLG Dallas on the first day of the event [due to a family emergency](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12jml0/djwheat_leaves_mlg_due_to_family_emergency/). An update from his twitter is met with a now-deleted comment from /u/teknorath [questioning why djWHEAT is tweeting in the middle of a supposed emergency](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12jml0/djwheat_leaves_mlg_due_to_family_emergency/c6vofej). 

Some members of the community are still upset from djWHEAT's outburst at Destiny [during a webshow some weeks ago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=u4FTflKqQ58#t=60s). (Definitely worth a watch!) This sentiment spawns comments [such as this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12jml0/djwheat_leaves_mlg_due_to_family_emergency/c6vlq19)  by /u/masterpain. 

A user leaves a now-deleted [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12jml0/djwheat_leaves_mlg_due_to_family_emergency/c6vlv8v) in which he states that he hopes djWHEAT's son got his eye stuck in a chainsaw. In the ensuing comment string, he continues to defend his statement as a legitimate opinion while other users call him a sociopath. djWHEAT sees the comment and [responds on Twitter](https://twitter.com/djWHEAT/status/264552166096764929) with “a big fuck you to the assholes on reddit.” This tweet is submitted to reddit [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12jq14/a_big_fuck_you_to_the_assholes_on_reddit_you/).

Meanwhile, the community response in the original thread is mostly supportive of djWHEAT, so much so that even people saying they don't like djWHEAT but hope his family is okay [are swamped with downvotes and criticized](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12jml0/djwheat_leaves_mlg_due_to_family_emergency/c6vm1ya). 
***
**Player Drama**

Pro player Geoff ""EG.iNcontroL"" Robinson wins a match 2-1 against amateur player Flatline in the open bracket. iNcontroL has been in a serious slump and has failed to produce results for a very long time. However, instead of congratulating him, the community decides to make fun of him instead. 

A [screenshot of the match result](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12jpwf/the_biggest_up_set_in_mlg_championship_so_far/) is submitted, with the title ""The biggest up set(sic) in MLG so far."" 

The [top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12jpwf/the_biggest_up_set_in_mlg_championship_so_far/c6vmjki) is a reference to recent drama between iNcontroL and Destiny, from a webshow during which iNcontroL argues that the competitive Starcraft 2 scene is perfectly fine because he is getting a raise next month. [Original SRD thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11zx16/a_starcraft_2_progamer_egincontrol_gets_mad/). The rest of the thread is populated by similar comments making fun of iNcontroL's weight, tournament results, attitude, etc., and when /u/Triesk [steps in to defend him](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12jpwf/the_biggest_up_set_in_mlg_championship_so_far/c6vpb5g), he gets downvotes. 

The thread overall is rather tame, but that's because it's just a warm-up. iNcontroL proceeds to lose his next match against pro player Jacob “4NOT.JakeBake” Shevloff. [Another thread is submitted](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12jtfx/4notjakebake_beats_egincontrol_21_in_owr3/), and the bashing continues, with comments making fun of iNcontroL's [training habits](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12jtfx/4notjakebake_beats_egincontrol_21_in_owr3/c6vnf0u), etc. etc. 

/u/EGiNcontroL then [shows up in the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12jtfx/4notjakebake_beats_egincontrol_21_in_owr3/c6vse5i?context=3) to let the community know that they have “made [him] feel like utter shit” and that he's deleting his account. As you can see from the replies, he receives no sympathy. This drama appears to have calmed down for now. We'll have to wait to see if it (or iNcontroL) resurfaces on reddit in the future. 
***
**Cheerleader Drama**

Meanwhile, iNcontroL's teammate, Ilyes “EG.Stephano” Satouri takes third place in the Electronic Sports World Cup, a tournament currently being held in France. You may be familiar with Stephano from previous drama involving controversial statements about abusing a 14-year-old. [Previous SRD thread here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11e9tl/stephanogate_update_team_evil_geniuses_suspends/)

A screenshot of [Stephano checking out some cheerleaders](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12k5a8/stephano_taking_in_the_view/) is submitted to the sub. /u/Jonofthed3ad bravely writes a comment protesting the presence of cheerleaders for Starcraft, admonishing no one in particular, but insisting that they [have some fucking class](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12k5a8/stephano_taking_in_the_view/c6vsczx). Other users disagree with either his message or his method of communication, as /u/MoonRazer calls him [a self-righteous, narcissistic asshole](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12k5a8/stephano_taking_in_the_view/c6vwm7m), and /u/moor-GAYZ calls him [a homophobe](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12k5a8/stephano_taking_in_the_view/c6vun94). moorGAYZ is almost definitely trolling, but manufactured popcorn is still popcorn. 
***
**SRS Drama**

This brings us to [this wonderful gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12m90e/nanibrows/) of pro player Johan ""NaNiwa"" Lucchesi sneaking a peek at the chest of community host and personality Rachel ""SeltzerPlease"" Quirico during an interview. You can watch the full interview [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12lefr/naniwa_on_practicing_without_a_team_rediscovering/).

At first glance you can already see that people are in a bad mood, as /u/TheHooDooer is in the negative simply for wishing someone a happy cake day in the very top comment thread. 

The reason for this becomes abundantly clear when you reach the [second top level comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12m90e/nanibrows/c6w9p33), in which /u/Qlimaxsc2 compliments Seltzer, saying ""Well in [NaNiwa's] defense , rachel is looking pretty damn fine."" SRS did not like this at all. [A thread pointing to the comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays+SRSSucks/comments/12mzmf/on_sc2_progamer_naniwa_ogling_a_womans_breasts/) was made. Currently the SRS thread has only one popcorn worthy comment in which a user refers to starcraft as beardcraft. The real fun is happening in the original thread, courtesy of SRS invasion punctuated by [familiar cries of check your privilege](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12m90e/nanibrows/c6wfxg5) and [white knighting behavior](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12m90e/nanibrows/c6wau0b).

The thread also contains [a sidebar on the merits of ""gamer girls""](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12m90e/nanibrows/c6wb9cl), as well as a reference to [some very old NaNiwa drama](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=294711) that [goes over way too many peoples' heads](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12m90e/nanibrows/c6w9qd0). 

To add to the absurdity (although this has nothing to do with any kind of drama, and is mostly just strange), [a wild kpop thread appears](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12m90e/nanibrows/c6w9qo4). 


Update: Seltzer herself shows up in the thread to [defend herself from a quote taken out of context](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12m90e/nanibrows/c6wnjuo?context=3) but manages to steer clear of the drama.

**Miscellaneous Drama**

Loosely sorted in order of butteryness, better stuff at the top. 

[User is confused as to why commentators are referring to a trans player as female](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12jkrg/scarlett_gives_zero_fucks/c6vl5zi), causes a discussion as to whether or not the player in question is male or female, and whether or not being transgender is a medical condition. 

[Downvotes over whether or not it is appropriate for a female pro player to cry after a match](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12k1nk/eve_is_playing/c6vpnrl). 

Pro player forfeits spot in the top division of the world's most prestigious tournament to participate in MLG Dallas. [Argument over whether or not it was a good decision](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12g01m/sk_telecom_t1_rain_has_forfeited_his_code_s_spot/c6uq7n5), the current state of Starcraft leagues, and prize pools. 

[A zerg player beats a protoss player in an upset](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12kjsc/moonglade_pulls_a_21_over_mc/), prompting arguments about whether or not the current game is imbalanced in favor of zerg. 

[A girl posting some cosplay is criticized for her use of smileys](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12mqc9/do_not_fear_broodlordgirl_is_here_back_with_my/c6wjry2). 

[Completely one-sided match in the open bracket](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12joko/maximus_black_vs_trimaster_with_apollotb_casting/c6vm4oa) leads to debate over whether or not it was okay for the commentators to make fun of the less-skilled player and argument over exactly how skilled either player was anyway.

[A user becomes irrationally upset](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12mitg/i_am_quite_surprised_they_didnt_have_to_expand/c6wd3sq) when jokes made by the commentators of MLG's online tournament stream are submitted to the subreddit. 

[A picture of an old guy with a laptop](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/12lyog/words_of_wisdom_from_an_old_man/) ignites the Starcraft vs. League of Legends argument.

We also have a surprise. After thinking about it for a while, and dealing with the issues too often, we've decided to repeal our personal attacks/flamewars rule. It has proven in recent times to be a titanic hassle to enforce, and has more often than not been used by malicious parties to their advantage against normal users.

This is not to say we will let all shit-fests go without regulation. We still will hold our zero-tolerance policy on racial/sexual slurs, hate-speech and bigotry. We also still hold the right to remove any comment or post as we see fit. Not the whole ""Nazi-powertripping mods"" thing, just a reasonable expectation that this is not a democracy and we as mods have final say.

I do not wish to take power away from our users in removal of offensive content, I more wish to put more power back in our hands and take it away from abusive 3rd parties.

The thread discussed many things including the headline rules, non Canadian mods but constantly davidreiss was asked to step down.

qg finally decides that [holding a public vote](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/wvcqa/on_the_moderation_of_rcanada_a_modest_proposal/c5grqv5) would be a good idea.

He asks reddit for advice while asking to not be front paged.

50 edits later, he seems to have botched any chance he ever had, and is on the front page.

[The drama spills over into IAmA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/u5ax3/ama_request_the_girl_sitting_next_to_the_sap_on/), with an AMA request for the girl being tortured sitting next to the SAP on the bus.

Winning comment so far:

&gt;No, I can't take pictures, that would be creepy.

&gt;What are some good questions or conversation starter?

&gt;When I introduce myself, do I shake her hand?

&gt;Proper eye contact? SHIIIIIIIT! She's so beautiful I might end up staring for too long.

&gt;If I update you while we're talking, wouldn't that be bad manners that I'll be typing into my phone when we're having a conversation(if we'll have a conversation).

&gt;IMPORTANT! Please do not upvote this post. It might get into the frontpage and she might check Reddit on her phone later. Thanks DrWallyHayes for making me realize it.

&gt;Edit1- So, she just asked me if it's ok to change places because she wants to sit by the window. And by monster stupidity, I just said: ""My pleasure."" Shit, that's like England, circa 1970.

&gt;Edit2- She took her phone out and the tension is worse than when I was being circumcised! Good thing she just looked at the screen for a while and returned it to its case.

&gt;Edit3- Shit. Almost 30 minutes now and the only thing I've said to her is ""My pleasure."" Fucking fuck.

&gt;Edit4- It's almost over an hour and I'm like a PC with no soundcard. shit. shit. shit.

&gt;Edit5- Did you guys just put this in the frontpage? FUCK!

&gt;Edit6- Guys, I'm ready to give up and just be silent all the way. I really don't have the courage to start it. Well, I CAN start it but I'm worried I can't sustain the conversation.

&gt;Edit7- Well, I have decided that I'll talk to her. But the thing is, should I bring up Reddit or not? There are pros and cons. I want me to be a ""normal"" guy having a conversation with a girl and not just ""someone from Reddit"" talking to another Redditor in real life. Fuck this thoughts! Shit, 3 hours more!

&gt;Edit8- She seems to be asleep so I got the chance to stare at her for an extended period of time. Almighty God Lord Jesus Christ she is so beautiful. must.resist.taking.a.pic. To those asking me to take a pic, here's the thing: if ever I get the chance to talk to her and introduce myself, wouldn't it be creepy if she later finds out I've been taking pics of her while she's asleep?

&gt;Edit9- If all else fails, I'll go with EarthRester's advice: At the end of the bus ride, give her your number and say ""If you happen to check reddit today, you'll understand""

&gt;Edit10: SHIT! WE JUST TALKED! So, she was falling asleep and her head leaned towards me and she had one of those verge-of-sleeping-sudden-head-movement. She looked at me and shyly said: ""I'm sorry."" I told her: ""No worries, it's ok."" That's it. She's leaning by the window now with her eyes closed. 3 hours more!

&gt;Edit11- I apologize in advance if this does not end the way you are expecting. this is the longest time I have sat beside a girl with our shoulders rubbing once in a while. It's not that easy.

&gt;Edit12- I really don't want to comment on her ample breasts or long, beautiful legs because if I will have to talk to her through reddit PM later or soon or maybe never, at least she'll know I'm a good guy.

&gt;Edit13- But seriously, and I hope she takes this as a compliment. She's hotter, more proportionately sized, and definitely more beautiful and attractive than the girls who have been on the frontpage of Gonewild.

&gt;Edit14- Ah.. about the other bus post. yeah, I ride the bus twice a day, five times a week. I won't delete that; I don't care either if she reads that. Lots of things happen when you travel. It's one of the more exciting things in life.

[**In the beginning, SRS opened a merch store**](http://www.zazzle.com/fempire)  
  
The zazzle page contains finery such as Dolphin buttons, DWORKIN/OBAMA bumper stickers, a $50 ""FEMALES BEEP BOOP"" pillow and various references to ""dags"". It also includes the [following mug](http://www.zazzle.com/tyson_sagan_kissing_on_ur_coffee_mug-168711665636939961). I guess [this mousepad](http://www.zazzle.com/ronny_paul_richy_d_making_out_on_ur_mouse_mousepad-144050980500805565) is also relevant.

From what I've gathered, the monetization of the Fempire has been well received, but there have been concerns that the above mug and mousepad come across as homophobic, as all of the merchandise is designed to be a joke at Reddit's expense. u/LauraOfTheLye started a thread in SRSD, and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/v5feb/the_srs_mugs_are_homophobic/) is what it looks like.

Yep, nuked and banned for concern trolling.
Apparently, the post went as follows:
&gt; The entirety of SRS culture is directed towards the ridicule of redditors, their icons and their beliefs. So, why are we using two men kissing in a comical setting? Why are we using two men kissing to mock redditors? What's so hilarious about two men kissing? I personally don't see it as funny. I find it incredibly offensive.

The topic was then revived in SRSMeta by LauraOfTheLye with some lengthier and more in-depth reasoning, to be seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSMeta/comments/v648j/why_i_think_the_srs_mugs_are_problematic/)

I want to hear your opinions about the current state of the Subreddit and anything revolving around that, from the SRS megathread to a rise in the amount of MRA drama recently, if you have an observation/ opinion on anything I'd like to hear it.

One specific thinking I am looking for is the community opinion on moderation. Regardless of *my* opinion on recent moderator decisions here, the apparent amount of modhate is very disheartening, it's starting to feel like /r/leagueoflegends sometimes. Of course I may be overreacting, and this thread is to help get a feel for all that, but at this moment the community seems really toxic to me.

Original Thread:  http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/12kc3d/happend_halloween_night/

____________________________________

OP, /u/petermarronmusic, [claims that he was approached by two bisexual foreign girls who asked for weed.]  (http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/12kc3d/happend_halloween_night/c6vusj6)   OP was quite upset when they refused to have sex with him, prompting him to embody his rage in an image macro [here.](http://i.imgur.com/D2Y8g.png)                                                 


That's really all there is to OP's story, but the rest of the thread is full of Ents complaining about ['vultures'](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/12kc3d/happend_halloween_night/c6vuio3) and the like.  I wouldn't grab my popcorn bowl for this thread, but the amount of rage is unusual in an /r/trees thread.


Highlights:  

/u/forever420: [Despairs and calls OP a dumbass and then ragequits r/trees.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/12kc3d/happend_halloween_night/c6vxrnf)

/u/sc2wetwipe tells OP to sleep with the girl when [she's high.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/12kc3d/happend_halloween_night/c6vtx1u)  OP responds that he [tried.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/12kc3d/happend_halloween_night/c6vua0c)

/u/animalfruit likens the event to [prostitution](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/12kc3d/happend_halloween_night/c6vvb8t).

&gt; syncretic had submitted a formal request for moderation, and has also recently been proactive with assisting us current mods in our duties as stated by creepig elsewhere in here.

syncretic stayed proactive and contacted the mods about a [possible doxxer in this subreddit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/w06b0/meta_so_srd_hating_syncretic_is_a_mod_here_now/c595l98) Because of that and probably other actions, creepig modded syncretic.

&gt; Because syncretic had no idea that his actions would lead to getting modded. We don't tell people that they're in the running until their modding is essentially a forgone conclusion. It is not possible for him to have come up with such a dastardly plan to infiltrate our subreddit if he didn't know that he could end up modded for it.

As we know though:

[21:10] &lt;@syncretic&gt; I think some sort of ""neutrality"" rule would be in the same vein as the ""don't submit drama you're involved with"" rule.  
[21:10] == Addyct_  has joined #subredditdrama  
[21:10] &lt;@syncretic&gt; It would prevent people from submitting drama when they have a ""horse in the race"" so to speak.  
[21:11] &lt;@ZeroShift&gt; Agreed

Get you.",urwrngtrll,212,68,291,http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ns9w3/how_i_was_banned_from_a_subreddit_ive_never/,"So I checked reddit this morning. Orangered. Found a message from someone called [fxexular](http://www.reddit.com/user/fxexular) about /r/ShitRedditSays . I wasn't familiar with this subreddit so I was quite surprised that fxexular had messaged me to say I was banned. Thought it was a troll. Turns out fxexular is a mod over at r/ShitRedditSays and I was banned. Anywyay, I replied to the message only to get this back ""¯(ツ)/¯"". Rather strange response. 

So I tried a few more times. Each time I got ¯(ツ)/¯ back. Now...I didn't really care much about being banned from r/ShitRedditSays. It doesn't look like it would interest me but I was curious as to why a mod had banned me. 

So, I decided to message another mod from that subreddit called '[therealbarackobama](http://www.reddit.com/user/therealbarackobama)'. The response was better - ""were you being creepy in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/nquef/fapfapfapfapfapfapfap_potentially_nsfw/c3b86ae)""? Now we were getting somewhere. I turns out that I had posted in that thread - but nothing I would deem to be creepy. 

 So...I messaged therealbarackobama back with this....

&gt;I did post to that thread but it certainly wasn't anything creepy. I replied to a post by 'supergood' who said ""But such large teeth.."". I replied: [""All the better to eat you with my dear.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/nquef/fapfapfapfapfapfapfap_potentially_nsfw/c3b972d) A reference to a fairly famous children's tale - Little Red Riding Hood. I'm guessing fxexular is the girl in the photo. However I certainly didn't intend to be creepy - in fact it was directed at 'supergood'. So, I am still confused. Why am I being banned from r/shitredditsays for a post in r/gaming? And do you honestly think this is good grounds for a ban? 

therealbarackobama replied: ""we banned a lot of people for being creepy thread, it looks like you slipped through the cracks, ban lifted.""

Now, I'm confused why are mods from /r/shitRedditsays banning people for things they have said in r/gaming? As I already mentioned I suspect that the mod 'fxexular' is actually the girl in the [/r/gaming](/r/gaming) picture post. But I digress. Anyway, I replied to the realobama mod:

&gt;Hey thanks for that. It would really help if mods could respond the way you have. I asked fxexular repeatedly for a reason and each time they replied with ""¯(ツ)/¯"". I don't think this helps anyone and gives the impression that mods are children on a power-trip.

His response surprised me.

&gt;dont push it, you were one of multiple messages fx got and they all got that reply, *i dont expect my mods to engage with the typical redditor*, because i'm willing to handle things if they get escalated to me

Sorry, but what the fuck? I'm minding my own business then get wrongly accused of being creepy and banned from a subreddit I've never visited. Ask for an explanation from the mod (who messaged me to announce this ban) and get multiple messages back containing just an emoticon - nothing else and not even a very good one. Yet I am pushing it? WTF mods? If you don't want to ""engage with the typical redditor"" then don't fucking ban them without reason then spam them with emoticons. How many other people does this shit happen to? I'm guessing lots. Should mods be allowed to ban people for something they have said in another subreddit? 

**TL/DR: Told I was banned from shitredditsays after posting in r/gaming. Mods don't have to 'engage with typical redditors' so get flooded with emoticons instead. Turns out they made a mistake** 

Edit: Sorry for the huge wall of text but I wanted to get this off my chest and didn't want to leave anything out. I feel much better now. lol

**Edit 2: Just found [THIS GEM](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRS/comments/nurcg/shitredditsays_campaigner_and_apologist_alyoshav/) from ShitRedditSays campaigner, defender, apologist and frequent poster AlyoshaV *** Oh the irony...

They have a less than stellar reputation and have been known for ruining their own quality titles with terrible monitization, pay2win microtransaction, bad balancing, bad community interaction, lag issues, abandoning games and more. 

Now after all that for some inexplicable reason they decided to nuke their own official forums and migrate to social media as their official community outlet, Reddit among them. Note that this was with only 24 hours notice and they didn't even bother to contact the mods of the subreddits of their games. 

The announcement blew up in multiple subreddits, generating drama all over.
