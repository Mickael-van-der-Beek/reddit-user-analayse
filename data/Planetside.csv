###General
* Aim at enemies and press ""Q"" to spot them, making a little triangle appear over their heads for your friends.
* If you aim at a friendly player and press ""Q"", you will ask them for context specific help: ammo from engineers, healing from medics and a ride from a vehicle.
* You can also keep Q pressed down to open the ""commo rose"" that allows you to interact with the targeted person in various ways.
* Do not destroy enemy terminals when attacking. Let infiltrators hack them instead.
* Find a squad/platoon and roll with it. You are unlikely to do much or survive long alone.
* Fight in a group, not in a mob. Outnumbering the enemy 50:1 is useless and will result in boring game play and little experience. See ""Zerg"" in the lingo section.
* One way to find an outfit (a guild) is using the [r/ps2outfits](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps2outfits) subreddit.
* You passively gain certs even when you are offline at a rate of 2 certs every 6 hours for 48 hours after last login. 
* Unlocked attachments are weapon specific.
* You can not shoot in to hostile spawn rooms.
* You can shoot out from a spawn room.
* Do the math on the two above points (Hint: Them shooting you while you can't shoot back is usually quite bad).
* Weapons in this game are **sidegrades**, meaning that no weapon is in any real way better than any other. They just fit into other situations. F.ex one weapon can have great accuracy but slow rate of fire while another has a fast rate of fire but is less accurate, resulting in the latter being better in extremely close encounters, but being much worse in medium to long ranges.
* When you unlock attachments or upgrades, remember to equip them. They won't help you if you are not using them.
* Pressing H toggles a bigger minimap view. The enlargened minimap blocks the capture process indicators.
* You can press ALT to enable and disable a mouse cursor when ingame. Use it to switch chat views.

###Infantry
##General
* Do not run on roads. Those tank drivers can't really see well and rarely can stop in time to avoid running over you.
* Just like you were told to as a kid: look both ways before crossing.
* You can **not** equip both nanoweave and improved shields at the same time. You should choose one and focus on it. Same applies to all slots.
* Let the medic heal you to full health after he has revived you.
* You do **not** take damage when dropping from a galaxy dropship.
* All small arms (even pistols) do damage to fighters. Shoot at them to scare them away, if you are under attack and have no Anti-Air nearby.
* The knife (T) two-shots all non-MAX infantry. Use it on unaware enemies to save ammo.
* Your very first cert should be spent on Nanoweave Armor. It gives +10% health for **1** cert.
* You unlock the Spawn Beacon from the Command certification tree. The certification requires Battlerank 10.
* Never run over vehicle spawn points. You are just asking to be squished under a spawning sunderer.
* Flashlights on weapons only act as a giant ""shoot me"" -sign.
* Most weapons require burst firing to be effective.
* You can switch fire modes (single shot, full auto etc.) with B.

##Light Assault
* Use your speed and agility to strike from unexpected angles. Going head-to-head is usually a bad idea.
* Your jump jets automatically activate when you keep space bar pressed down.
* Using your jump jets when dropping from a galaxy (even for a split second) removes the fall damage immunity from you.
* C4 is extremely powerful against turrets, vehicles, MAX units and clusters of enemy infantry.

##Medic
* Friendlies you revive come to life with reduced health. Heal them back up before carrying onwards.
* You can not heal a wouded MAX unit.
* You can revive a MAX unit that has been killed.
* The medic's ability is an Area of Effect (AoE) heal that affects all nearby friendlies. Use it when it does the most good for both you and your friends.

##Engineer
* You can heal (repair) a wounded MAX unit.
* Always drop ammo near Heavy Assaults that are firing rockets. They need it bad and you get tons of points.
* You can replace the ammo box on your loadout and still give out ammo by equiping the turret and pressing B (change fire mode).
* Deployed turrets can act as cover for friendlies, even if you don't plan on firing the turret yourself.

##Heavy Assault
* Shooting at the rear of a vehicle does insane amounts of damage. You can two-shot a main battle tank by shooting at it's rear with the default launcher.
* Your shields also negate damage suffered from dropping.
* The default rocket launcher does most pure damage. The anti-air launcher does least damage. The anti-tank lock-on launcher sits right between the two.
* Both lock-on launchers need three rear hits against a main battle tank. The default destroys it with two.

##Infiltrator
* Hack **all** the things! Every hacked terminal is free exp for you, a resupply station for your friends and a nuisance for the enemy.
* Shift steadies your aim for a moment when using a scope.
* Hacking an occupied turret forces the (confused) enemy out of it.
* Cloak is not an invisibility: you are only harder to see. You are easier to see when moving than when immobile.
* Do not play like a sniper, shooting from behind friendly lines. Play like an infiltrator and get behind the enemy positions for maximum effect.
* You can not be healed when cloaked.
* IRNV scopes see cloaked people just fine.
* You can not fire while cloaked.
* Enemies can not spot you with Q when you are cloaked.
* If you have been spotted by an enemy (with Q), you can remove the spotting by cloaking.
* Consider cloaking into an enemy held base, hacking a terminal and spawning an AMS equipped sunderer. If you have a platoon/squad that can then instantly spawn when you deploy your vehicle, the enemy won't know what hit 'em!

##MAX
* Wait for a few seconds if you die: a friendly medic can revive you!
* **Everyone** starts with a single Anti-Air Buster on their MAX loadout. Use this if you need AA and there is nothing better available.
* When doing Anti-Air duty, **lead** your targets. It's no use having the bullets fly past behind him.
* You can use the MAX units charge ability (F) to quickly move from place to place. Great for getting closer to enemies, running away and just changing location.
* Switching out of the MAX suit invokes the acquisition timer.
* You can, however, change your weapons at any terminal without any penalty.

###Vehicles
##General
* Setting a vehicle to ""squad/platoon"" allows your squad/platoon mates to drive the vehicle.
* You can use the Vehicle Management menu (Page Down) to lock a vehicle down (only you can enter) or to only allow people in squad/platoon to enter.
* All vehicle weapons have a 1 cert each upgrade for basic ammo capacity and added zoom.
* HE = High Explosive. Great against infantry. Less effective against heavy armor.
* HEAT = High Explosive Anti Tank. Great against light armor, okay against infantry.
* AP = Armor Piercing. Great against heavy armor. Less effective against infantry.
* You can use cruise control with vehicles to make them go forward without having to press any buttons. Press the = key to enable and disable cruise control.
* Use the function keys (F1-F12) to change seats in a vehicle. If you try to change to an occupied seat, the person on the seat will be can choose wether to change seats or not.
* Set up your personal waypoint by right clicking the map screen. You are less likely to make a wrong turn if you know the general direction you wish to go to.

##Ground vehicles
* You need to unlock the 50cert Sunderer Advanced Mobile Station (S AMS) to be able to deploy your vehicle. Remember to equip it after unlocking it.
* When driving close to infantry with no nearby hostiles, press T to enter third person mode. This gives you more vision on possible nearby friendly infantry.
* As a gunner, do not shoot at everything moving. This will only alert the enemy to your presence without really doing any damage to that Liberator flying a mile away.
* The default 20mm dual-barreled machinegun on main battle tanks and sunderers does damage even to main battle tanks. Help out your gunner when he is engaging armor. You shooting at the tank too can be the deciding factor.
* Parking a vehicle where people using a jump pad land on kills the people coming in flying. Avoid doing this to friendlies.
* Do not park vehicles on vehicle spawn points. It will only end badly.
* Turn off your lights by pressing L. Using them only attracts attention.

##Air vehicles
* Fly in third person mode (T) for better view on your surroundings.
* Rebind air vehicle exit to something you won't hit accidentally when reloading.
* There is no parachute, if you have to bail out, get low and get slow, then jump out. If you are going too fast or too high, you will die, the exception being if you are in a Galaxy.
* Consider binding the pitch controls to your keyboard. This allows you a faster and finer control over your aircraft.
* Set your personal waypoint to a safe location you can use to resupply and repair. This way, you'll instantly know where to retreat to if you get ambushed. Many a good pilots have ""retreated"" straight to an even greater danger in an adrenaline rush.

###The World
##Continents
* As of now, there are three continents in the game, each with a distinct theme.
* You can change continent by using the terminal with a planet on it at your factions warp gate.
* By capturing all capturable terrain on a continent, your faction conquers the continent. This gives you a continent specific bonus.
* You lose the bonus if another faction succeeds in capturing all capturable territory from said continent.
* The bonuses are -10% on infantry (Indar), mechanized (Esamir) or aircraft (Amerish) purchases.

##Bases
* There are three types of major facilities: Bio labs, Tech plants and Amp Stations.
* Tech Plants allow acquisition of main battle tanks from connected territories. You can always acquire main battle tanks from the warp gate.
* Bio labs give the owning faction a small health regeneration in connected territories.
* Amp stations award large amount of mechanized or air resources and reduce the overheating of base turrets.
* A multitude of smaller outposts with no specific bonuses (except resources) exist between these major facilities.

##Capturing
* If you see that control points have less than their max number of people on it (not all 6 on a CP, or not all three CPs have 2 on them), go to it, it caps faster!
* Capture process's speed is affected by your factions influence on the base. Check the pie chart on the left side of your screen for for your influence. Influence is based on the adjacent hexes owned by your faction.
* The capture process is a ""tug of war"". You need to undo all the enemy's progress before your factions capture bar starts to progress.
* The bar on top of your screen is not the bases capture progress. It's the capture progress for the single point you are on.
* You can not capture bases that have no connection to friendly territory. If you lose the connection after starting the capture process, you can still finish it.
* Destroying the SCU (Spawn Control Unit) prevents the owners of the base from spawning in that bases spawn rooms.
* Some hostile shields block only vehicles, some both vehicles and infantry. Owners of the facility can always pass through shields.
* Some shields can be shot through by the owner of the facility. Attackers can not shoot back.
* Shields have icons on them, that correspond to the generator keeping the shields up. Some shields have multiple generators.
* Everyone can hack generators by pressing E for a few seconds. This causes the generator to destabilize, resulting in an explosion after a few moments.
* Shooting (or using explosives) at a generator only damages that friend of yours who was trying to hack it. You can not damage generators with weapons.
* An exploding generator will kill you. Don't stand within a dozen meters of an one that is about to go boom.
* Bio labs can be accessed through teleporters and jump pads from outlying, capturable ""outposts"" that do not factor in to the actual capture progress of the base. Some bio labs also have towers with lifts under the landing pads.
* You can **never** enter the bio lab from directly beneath it as an attacker.

##Defending
* Stabilize (unhack) a generator as any class by going to it and pressing E for a few seconds.

##Resources
* You need resources to purchase vehicles (air and ground), MAX units and infantry items like medkits and grenades.
* Resources are granted every 5 minutes based on the regions owned by your faction on the continent you are on.
* You can see the amount of resources you will gain next time on the right side of your map screen.

There needs to be an incentive to capturing, more than just an XP bonus for flipping the point. Something which will make everyone want the point for the facility and the bonus.

It needs to be something very high, I would like in XP to be rewarded 3 kills worth of XP and 1.5 assists worth of XP every 30 - 45 seconds as well as 1 cert point every minute.

First off. If we have clear evidence of a person cheating we ban them. We search for any other accounts they have and we ban those too. We have very good hacking detection algorithms. They aren't perfect though. There are some things that are very hard to detect. There is no ""7 day ban"". That's a myth. Sometimes we suspend someone for 7 days. This is typically someone who is breaking a rule but it doesn't warrant banning. Sometimes we suspend people for something while we actually suspect them of cheating. We'll watch them when they come back and the GM's are able to watch people while they play to make sure we're satisfied they are cheating.

Sometimes people say ""But this guy is an obvious aimbotter"". That may be true. It may not be. There are a lot of really good people in this game. There are also aimbotting scumbags. Telling the difference can be tough for our players sometimes but it's not for us. However we are careful about who we ban. We don't just ban because some player reports and says person X is an aimbotter. We actually put in the time to confirm this.

Also please don't use the new player site as ""proof"" that someone is cheating. I said when we launched it that it's still beta and we're still working out some data issues.

Also please realize the fight against cheaters is not a war we will ever be finished with. We make new detection and anti-hack code, they spend time and try and work around it. It's a constant effort. We just want you to know we hate them just as much as you do and we're busting our asses to get them out of the game. Do we do it as fast as you might like? Not all the time no. But we also don't want to falsely accuse people without solid proof.

I hope this helps clear this up at least a little. I'm sure there will be people that don't think we're doing enough. After having personally viewed some of the major cheat sites I can tell you I'm blown away by how sophisticated some of these operations are. They are making money on this. We're working on that from another angle too that I'm not going to go into just yet (hint. it involves lawyers) . But we have the resources to fight this fight and we will keep doing it.

Let me be crystal clear about where I stand on this and where SOE stands.

We will not tolerate bigots, homophobes, racists, anti-semites or people being basic asshats in our game. If we catch you doing any of that you're gone. I've read a great deal about The Enclave and seen enough to make me make this general comment - if I see any of this behavior whatsoever in the game I will personally ban anyone doing it. I will do it publicly and I will do it loudly and as broadly as I can possibly make happen. Go play another game if you want to act like a jerk. We don't need or want your business.

In the specific incident that happened TB responded to it very well and we're going to make sure to avoid showcasing any guild that represents itself that way even outside the game. If you don't like that, tough. We'll ban you for what you say in the game but if you act like a ray of sunshine inside the game you'll still get to play. But if you are a well known as being any of the things I listed above outside the game - guess what. You're not going to be on any of our public facing stuff.

I want to be clear that there's nothing we will do inside the game if you follow our rules. That wouldn't be right.  We also aren't trying to be the internet police. This is a free country. People get to say what they want to say. But not in our game. It's our way or the highway on these subjects.

I also want all to know this is a hobby horse of mine personally. I really can't stand racists or homophobes or anti-semites. I think they are foul human beings and really don't want them anywhere near me.

Anyways. I hope I haven't minced words.

Thanks

One More Thing - I'm adding this for the benefit of some of the stuff I've read in the thread. In no way am I trying to cast aspersions on the entire guild The Enclave. There are mostly great people in there that I enjoy playing with.

We've all been there.  You and your comrades are in the middle of a massive push onto your enemy's tower.  From behind cover, you see your ally Billy's lifeless MAX suit just out of the protection of cover, a mere 4 ft out of from the maximum range of your medigun.  You know that if you were to step out to revive him, you'd be putting yourself in harm's way.

You suck it up, think ""this is it, this is what I'm here for, this is why I am a medic."", and wait for a lull in the RAT-A-TAT-TAT song of bullets.  The moment comes, you run over to your fallen friend, whip it out and start applying the love.  
Your mind's racing: 

""25%, oh god please."" is on repeat in your head. 

""50%.  Almost there Billy! Hang on!"".  

""75%, Oh no."" you think as the bullets start whizzing by your FACE. 

""90%, Hallejuah, he's gonna make it!""

Then...

Then...
Billy disappears.

Of course, with proper communication, this isn't a problem but not all players/squads/platoons have that communication luxury and/or skill.  Even those of us that do aren't always on top of it like we should be.

***I propose that a simple message (informing the player that he/she is being revived) is displayed somewhere on the screen of the downed player the EXACT MOMENT a medic begins the revival process.  This will allow downed players to make a more informed decision on whether or not to tap-out.***

One could say that the current implementation is more realistic in that once you are dead you have no further awareness of your surroundings until you are suddenly revived and are processing your senses again.  However, one could argue that perhaps the downed player is still semi-alive and can 'feel' the revival process as soon as it starts.

&gt;-_John Smedley on Hackers via Twitter_

 So this post is about SOE's **policy** regarding hackers, not technical aspects of it which is a different issue and not one we're going to address here.  

I think it's completely unacceptable that hackers are given a free pass like this in this game.  I understand there is a business aspect to this, I do, and if someone who was hacking decides they want to play legit then great!  But they should start over with a new character.  Their old character should have it stats reset and that character should be explicitly labeled ""Hacker"" on their stats in huge, red, comic sans letters.  

If I had it my way, the person who reported them for hacking with proof would get the hacker's character name mounted on their in-game profile like a taxidermed moose-head.  Players who follow the rules and support the game should have the ability to know if the person that beats them consistently is the real deal or not.  

The hacker paranoia has taken hold within the community.  I've seen hackers that I am 100% sure about make it all the way to ~BR30.  I have a list of people whom I suspect, but am not sure about, whose BRs are well into 50+ and beyond.  It must be really nice to be able to give yourself a little handicap over legitimate players without fear of repercussions.  Also, since money=station cash=weapons=certs it must be nice to steal your way through the game.

**How do I know this and where's my proof?**

  Well funny enough, I got to talk to someone who made a hacker account to **counter**-hack (LOL) one of Mattherson's more well-known long term and ridiculously obvious hackers - VanuSerpentor(BR29) (And heshe's TR alt LordSerpentor).  Here's a sample of LordSerpentor in a mossie: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DH6NP_-lkpA) .  I have multiple videos of this scumbag who was reported multiple times by multiple people.  Anyways, the hacker named their character V**e**nuSerpentor and then proceeded to counter-hack the shit out of VanuSerpentor in some attempt to bring cosmic balance to Auraxis.  It was pretty funny.  Now VenuSerpentor also hacked everyone else ridiculous amounts and got a stern 7 day ban.  That's it.  

Here's the email and here's their stats prior to having the ban lifted:

[E-mail](http://i.imgur.com/uCozY6n.png)

[Stats](http://imgur.com/I1layDq,qfjk0pF#1)

Here's their stat page after the ban is lifted:

[Post ban stats](http://imgur.com/I1layDq,qfjk0pF#0)

Yep, everything is still there on the character, the hacker confirmed that all his unlocks were available, and he got some nice passive cert gain!  

This is not a one-time thing.  I have multiple confirmations from different hackers at different BR levels (one at BR40).  I'm keeping some of it to myself for now because I want to see what happens to these people.  I wouldn't be surprised if nothing does.

This sure as hell isn't the hard-line against cheaters Smedley was proclaiming a few months ago.  You may never be able to completely rid online games of cheaters but when your policy is to just give them a free pass - that's completely unacceptable to me and probably a lot of you in the community.  If I ever stop playing this game, as one of the paying customers, it will be for shit like this.  Apologies for making this a public ordeal but this discussion has been private long enough with very little change in direction.

It's basically a new section in our normal forums that will be called Roadmap. In this section we will set up topics that relate to the things in our roadmap. The purpose is to have active discussion of the entire roadmap. There is a reddit style scoring system that allows people to upvote and downvote things. That's going to give us some rough idea of how people feel about a particular roadmap idea.

Does this mean we're changing it to ""the mob rules""? absolutely not. It's just a simple tool for us to be able to gauge sentiment about a particular topic. Remember it's still a forum thread (although with cool nested comments) and we'll still be reading what people are actually saying.

However if we list 5 topics for February and people highly vote 4 of those 5 and everyone hates on one of the ideas, it's fair to say that's going to get our attention.

In addition we're going to be implementing a new suggestion area with this same functionality that will allow users to create new threads. This likely won't go live tomorrow. This new functionality is in QA right now but it's likely to still have some bugs when you all jump in there. So we want to start with just the Roadmap section.

For the haters out there that say mobs dumb down games - I just flat out disagree with you that it's going to happen here. We have a vision for this game. You're going to see that tomorrow. Will it be one you like? I hope so. Will you agree with the order we're doing things? maybe.. maybe not. Probably not in some cases. Will be move things to more closely mirror the order you want things done? Sometimes yes.. sometimes it's not possible because of development time.

This is just another way for you to have your say in the future of Planetside 2. We want this to be a game we all share the vision for.

I'd love it if the buildings continued to remain in the game, but over time (every few game updates) become more and more dilapidated and decayed. Walls start to fall down, radio towers collapse, the entire complex starts to be overrun by sand (Indar), snow (Esamir), or plant growth (Amerish).  

Perhaps leave some infantry or vehicle terminals (and ammo towers) in the base, but as doorways become blocked up and buildings start to collapse, they become harder to reach.  

So far I've been rationalizing the addition/upgrades to facilities with game updates, as NS simply dropping more prefab parts from orbit.

I'm not saying increase it by double, but maybe by 1.5 times so the boosts really feel like a boost.

Edit * If you agree with me please speak up, atm the only people talking are those who disagree.

Edit** Wow this thread blew up. Really I just want to say to all the people saying it is not a charity I agree I'm a aux member with a heroic boost. But i have friends who do not and are all BR 1-10 because a lot of them left. Please try and realize that even if the cert rate was increased people would still buy SC as the people ATM who are buy it would continue you to most likely ( Like me I dropped over £40 on the 40% weekend).

Or If you read the thread there are a number of options to help bridge the gap for new players such as a leveling up prizes, this would help new players as they would receive it more often than the higher level characters who need it less. 

Next, as people are saying as well the PS2 population IS decreasing at a terrible rate, just look at Matherson ( I'm eu but i presume from what i have read that the TR and NC are dropping like crazy). As well as the number of server merges, I started on Mallery and now in Ceres.#

One could argue that this is camouflage doing it's job, or that any changes would make it worthless.  
The problem is that camo is meant to help you blend into the enviroment so that you have an advantage at a distance: **NOT** act as a means to confuse the enemy in CQC -- which the VS camo is currently doing. 

SoE needs to rethink how the camo is applied to soldiers because it's causing some problems when it comes to identifying who is who.

SOE tried to fix this problem by making the spawn rooms have windows (which is really a bad decision). This just leads to people trying to shoot out from it and never actually capping the base.

The real solution is to make them considerably larger and tiered. Make the first tier favor the attackers while the last tier favors the defenders. Allow the outside to have pathways and more access into the center of the dome.

This will allow for some really fun urban combat that is missing from the game.

1366123044.0,447,self.Planetside,1cgnso,Let's make tanks *Awesome* again *without nerfing infantry*,FrankManic,538,91,360,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1cgnso/lets_make_tanks_awesome_again_without_nerfing/,"EDIT: Check out [This article](http://www.military-history.org/articles/challenger-2-the-battle-for-basra.htm) about a British armor raid into Basra in the last war. That's what modern tank warfare is like. Are we getting anything like that? 

Frankly nerfs *suck*. No one wants their favorite toy nerfed into oblivion. And, dirty little secret, most weapons aren't ""OP"" so much as people *steadfastly refuse to adapt their tactics to deal with them*. But whatever. The problem with Tanks right now is that, even if they nerfed the AV turret or whatever people are complaining about this week, tanks still have a poorly defined battlefield role and just aren't that awesome. Instead of randomly nerfing the shit out of AV turrets let's make tanks *really cool*. 

Some suggestions

- Active point defenses.


Something like the real world Trophy-keeper systems. A module that shoots down incoming missiles in a volume around the tank. Balance it any way you want - Limited ammo, a limit to how many missiles it can take out, whatever. 

Say you have an anti-missile module for the Sunderer. It goes in the AMS slot. When it's active it has up to 6 charges. Each ""charge"" will shoot down one missile in a radius of 10m around the Sundy. Once a charge is expended it will take 15s to regenerate. If all the charges are used up it takes 90s to regenerate a full ""magazine"". The module works by creating an invisible sphere object that collides with missiles, lolpods, and lancer shots. You can cert into covering a wider area, holding more charges, or faster charge regen. It'd give tanks some protection, but requires a dedicated support vehicle and can still be overwhelmed by mass fire. Close range shots from inside the sphere are *not* blocked. 

WHY? This would give sunderers a new role supporting armor advances. Creating an area of protection would give groups of tanks an opportunity to advance into a range where they can effectively engage AV turrets. It would also let a sundy protect tanks from distant enemies sniping with guided launchers, a situation that often occurs when groups of infantry set up on a cliff or air-tower. Being an area defense mounted on a single vehicle reduces the number of people who have to cert into it for it to be effective. The sundy driver could get support XP for missiles destroyed. And I secretly love my sundy and wish I had more reasons to use it. 

* Infantry style shields for all MBTs 

Each MBT gets a regenerating shield the same way infantry get a regenerating shield. It can soak damage from the front and sides, but not the back. Because the tank can shrug off single shots shoot-and-scoot and pop out attacks are more viable

WHY? Simple, straightforward, and everyone already understands the mechanic

* Proper optics

Tanks really should have targeting range-finders, variable magnification zoom optics, and NVGs by default. These have been default on first-world tanks for *decades*. They would help a great deal with one of the primary problems that tanks have - Long range targeting. It doesn't *have* to automatically adjust the gun to hit wherever the reticle is pointing, but that would be nice. And realistic. Because they had that feature in WWII.

WHY? better optics would give tanks a better chance to actually hit infantry and AV turrets sniping at them from long range.  

* Coaxial machine guns with matched trajectories and tracers

Okay, okay, maybe full computer targeting is too much, to ""non-skill"" or something. A coax machine gun would help out in a lot of ways. real world tanks often have a coax gun that has the same trajectory as the main gun - A tracer fired from the coax gun will hit the same target as the main gun. You can fire the coax gun to gauge where your main gun will hit and save yourself from firing a shot that will miss. It allows for much more consistent first-round shots, especially against distant targets. 

A coax machine gun also gives tanks an alternate means of dealing with infantry. Welding a kobalt to the side of the main gun would let tanks shoot at infantry trying to bum-rush them with C4. It'd give them a weapon that doesn't *absolutely need to direct-hit* when firing up on infantry on ridges. Currently hitting infantry above you is extremely difficult. There is a reason real-world tanks have coax MGs. They'd also serve as a deterrent to aircraft. The kobalt doesn't do much damage, but it does do damage and it's much easier to train an MG onto an aircraft than fire your main gun and hope for the best. 

WHY? MGs allow you a better chance of killing an attacking LA or medic if your cannon shot misses. ""Matched trajectories"" allows you to fire some test shots at infantry on a cliff or air pad. If your shots hit the cliff in the right spot you know you can fire a cannon shot and it will explode on the cliff instead of flying over or hitting low. Being able to test where your shot will hit means you can pop out, test fire, take your real shot, then pop back into cover instead of having to wait around and fire multiple cannon shots until you get the range right. 

* Change how damage is calculated 

Add a system that checks the *angle at which a round impacted the tank*. Incoming rounds that hit the tank at a high angle should do little or no damage as they skip off the vehicles armor. Rounds that hit the tank at a good angle close to 90 degrees punch through and do their full damage. Tanks that are hull-down or in cover become much more survivable. Coincidentally you could also add a top-attack option to guided missiles - Have them pop straight up and arc down on top of enemy armor to get a 90 degree hit on the thinner top armor. This probably isn't feasible *at all*. But if implimented it would reduce instances of Sunderers outshooting Main Battle Tanks with their Basilisks and ATVs being able to destroy tanks. 

WHY? I just think this idea is awesome. You've got me dead to rights - I like tank sims. 

* Add an ERA module

Explosive Reactive Armor is a layer of explosive material applied to the exterior of a tank. When an AT round hits the ERA the ERA explodes. The force of that explosion moving out from the tank disrupts the force of the AT round, fouling it up and removing it's armor piercing potential. ERA could come with a fixed number of ""charges"" that have to be slowly regenerated once used up. Equipping and certing into ERA might let you survive a few extra rockets. Causing ERA charges to get used up by 20mm HMG or other heavy weapons would create a situation where allies could take out a tanks active defenses allowing follow-on shots from rockets. 

WHY? In game terms this just gives you a few free hits before you start taking real damage. It's effectively a shield with limited charges that can soak up the first shot from an AV turret, allowing you to react before you start taking real damage.

* add a ""Heat Camo"" module

Add a module that allows all tanks to ""Deploy"" thermal dump panels when not moving. The dump panels just vent engine heat out of the vehicle in weird directions to create a fuzzier heat signature for incoming missiles. All this does from a mechanics standpoint is create a tank 'targeting box' that is bigger than the actual hit-box, so a missile might hit where it thinks the tank is and miss the tank itself. Passive, requires the vehicle to be stopped, but reduces the effectiveness of lock-ons at long range. 

WHY? In game terms this would be a random chance for lock-ons to miss a stationary tank to make lock-on sniping from long distance less effective. Again - A counter to the massed infantry on an air tower spamming lock-ons


* Tank active camo

Allow tanks to cert into the same kind of camo that Infiltrators and Wraiths use. The camo can only be activated when the tank is stationary. Once activated the tank can still move, but it's move speed is limited to turning in place or moving at 1kph. Enough to adjust your aim (And all the maggie to aim at all) but not enough to go anywhere. You can *fire your guns while cloaked*. This disrupts the cloak for 90s but gives you an excellent ambush capability. If your damge falls below 75% your cloak becomes unreliable, randomly cutting in and out. The cloak has no duration as long as your tank isn't moving. 

WHY? Invisible tanks are hard to snipe with AV turrets. Tanks can now wait in ambush, creating a new play style where tanks are used to ambush sunderers and other vehicles. Having a tank suddenly appear in the middle of, or even behind, an infantry rush could be very disruptive and help outnumbered players turn the tide. Invisible tanks are harder to Lolpod

* Add IR smoke as a standard feature of all tanks

IRL *all* tanks have a smoke screen system. It's one of the most basic tank defenses. Add IR smoke, at the current lvl1 version, to all tanks. Allow tankers to cert into IR smoke if they want to, but give everyone, especially newbies, a chance of breaking lock-on locks. 

WHY? Nubs need something to protect them from lock-on spam. And if all tanks always had IR smoke as an option they'd be that much more resistant to mass lock-ons

* add proper smoke grenade launchers

With real tanks smoke grenades tend to be fired *forward* of the tank and are used to cover an advance as much as disrupt targeting. Give tanks a bank of smoke-grenade launchers that can be fired in front of the vehicle to hide it as it moves into an assault position. 

WHY? This would give tanks a new role providing concealment for infantry advances. It would make AV turret sniping much harder. it would give tanks a chance of hiding from LOLpods. 

* Add a coax gun to all tank secondaries

Most tanks also have a pintle-mounted LMG in addition to any other secondary weaponry. Giving the tank gunner an LMG would make it much easier for them to defend the tank against infantry attack. While specialized weapons are nice they tend to be a little *too* specialized.  Infantry are far and away the greatest threat to tanks, every tank should be able to defend itself to some degree against infantry rushing to drop mines or explosives. Allowing the secondary gunner to switch to an LMG and try to shoot down incoming infantry would help a great deal with that.

WHY? This would give the secondary gunner a better chance of stopping tank-mine and C4 rushes or killing infantry circling behind the tank. It would give the tank much better anti-infantry capability

* Vastly increase HP, introduce mobility and turret kills

In exchange for increased HP and armor tanks become vulnerable to mobility kills. When the tank is reduced to 50% health it becomes much slower and less maneuverable. At 33% health the tank becomes immobile. At 25% health the gun's reload speed drops by 20$. At 15% health the tank is completely immobile. 

The trade off is -1.75-3x hp. The tank can take much, much more punishment, but as it takes damage it becomes much, much more vulnerable, gradually losing the ability to dodge incoming fire and retaliate unless it is repaired. 

WHY? This would make tanks much more complex and interesting. They'd be much tankier and harder to kill. At the same time the amount of damage that currently kills a tank would now make it very vulnerable. 

* Add crewed guns with stabilized turrets

Seriously - Being able to fire the main gun on the move would be a vast improvement. Having one guy doing *nothing but driving*, one guy operating the main gun, and one guy operating the secondary gun means you have three sets of eyes to watch out for incoming fire and you can fire in two directions at once *while driving hell for leather*. 

Personally I think tanks should *never* have been one person vehicles. Requiring at least two people changes the cost/benefit scale such that you can make tanks much tougher. After all - each one *requires* two people who might otherwise be infantry. 

WHY? It's hard to drive in one direction and shoot in another. It's also hard to watch your own back. Splitting the jobs up between two people means the gunner can just worry about shooting things and the driver can just worry about moving and dodging fire. 

I'm out of ideas. My point, though, is that Tanks and vehicles generally can be made more fun and useful without nerfing the crap out of infantry. Let's focus on that, instead of trying to come up with ways to make the AV turret completely useless.

Sadly though i dont get revive XP often since it caps out after 10 or so revives, and heal caps out as well... meaning i revive and get no actual rewards for it. 

Now im an engineer, repairing tanks and dropping ammo for my brothers as they push onwards to victory. Without me any armoured column would quickly fall apart due to sustained battle damage...

Sadly enough after the 3rd hack i get no more XP... even though without me a base attack would take at least double the time it usually does.

Its like getting kicked in the face when all your support roles that are essential to any force is punished by not being given XP when without you the force would fall apart and die slowly. 

I understand its so that that exploiters cannot well... exploit... but do we really need to punish the entire playerbase because 1% of people bend the rules? Who cares if a squad stands there shooting at the sky all day while an engi drops ammo packs, they are doing nothing but punishing themselves. 

This game is... a game. We are meant to have fun and exploiters are basically castrating themselves by repeating the same actions over and over for the sake of getting a measly 10XP. 

If you are still worried, SOE, give us the ability to report exploiters with a specific command e.g. /reportExploiter and a GM can come and see for themselves whether or not to ban them.

The primary issue is that the focus of certs is entirely on killing. If a player comes across a well placed AMS sundie by the base he is trying to defend, he is much more likely to hang around it trying to farm kills of the spawning player than trying to blow it up, even though destroying the sunderer would be more beneficial for capping/defending the base. Likewise, people who choose to play support roles such as piloting galaxies and liberators feel like they are being punished because they earn so few certs.

I feel like the difference in cert gain between a player who is farming certs in the most effective way and someone who is playing just for fun should be small enough that it won't matter to most people. The best way to do this is to remove the effectiveness of gaining certs from kill farming, and move this to a passive cert gain.

Example: Say SOE feels that they want the average player to gain 50 certs per hour. The default passive cert gain when playing should be 25 certs per hour, so even if your are not a very good shooter, or you take on the low cert roll, your cert gain will only be half of what is average, instead of 1/4 or worse. Now, to prevent people focusing on kills, it now takes 500 xp per cert (5 kills) instead of 250. Base capping is adjusted so that it still rewards 1,2, or 4 certs depending on size. In fact, everything except kills are doubled up, so cert gain is the same for everything, but kills are now half as effective. This change right here fixes a large part of the problem.

Now that kills are less of a focus, we can try to improve other important team rolls (some of these ideas might be to complicated or taxing on the server, but they are still godd ideas if they can be pulled off):

-Sunderer bounty: For every player that spawns at an AMS sundie, it gains a point bounty, up to a maximum amount (say, 50 spawns = 1000 xp bounty, or 2 certs). The player who kills an important sunderer has just done something very important for the team, and would then be rewarded for it. Also, the bounty would be shared for players that assist to avoid kill stealing (do 50% of the damage in killing it, get 50% of the bounty). This bounty could also apply to other vehicles that have done a lot of damage to your team within your current hex. Kill that liberator that just killed 20 of your teammates, and get a nice 500 xp bonus.

-Air denial: People complain about getting no rewards when playing as anti-air, but to buff these to much would make air useless, as was seen in late beta. Infantry should be able to chase away aircraft, but they shouldn't have an easy time killing them; that should be the job of other aircraft. So, to still reward anti-air rolls, they get an area denial bonus. This requires one person to do 50% or greater damage to an ESF, 35% or greater to a liberator, or 25% or greater to a galaxy (for libs and galaxies, the total damage done by teammates still must be a least 50%). If the aircraft is not killed, but is forced to fly out of the hex, then a 100 xp air denial bonus is given.

-Base capping rewards: Right now, a lot of people will just hang out at a base, even if it is already dominated, just to get the cap bonus. There is no point to being there, but everyone just still hangs around for the 5 minutes it takes to cap that amp station. Bases should give participation rewards on cap that don't require you to be at the base to receive. Like in Guild Wars 2, you get a gold, silver, or bronze depending on your participation on taking the base. Example for taking AMP station: Bronze- Less than 25% of cap time spent at base and less than 300 points in hex during cap. Silver- Less than 50% of cap time at base and less than 1000xp gained in hex. Gold- At least 50% time of cap in base hex, or more than 1000xp gained in hex during cap.

These are just some ideas towards making cert gain less of a player's focus and allowing them to play for fun while still being rewarded. Ideally, the cert gain difference between a new, inexperienced player and a veteran would be around 30 certs per hour (roughly 40 certs/h vs 70 certs/hour) instead of the current system which can be as bad as 10 certs/h vs 100 certs/h. I know I get super frustrated when I realise I only made 15 certs in the last hour, even if I had fun doing what I'm doing.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,False,,tr,True,t3_14mlnx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/14mlnx/the_current_system_of_cert_gain_which_is_focused/,

3) In the very near future (the second I get the final report) we will be announcing banned numbers.

4) We are going to be working on increasing the quality of our reporting system in game and specifically to make sure the right reports float to the top.

1372816021.0,418,self.Planetside,1hjelz,Vehicle XP should be shared amongst crew,SenorBeef,484,66,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1hjelz/vehicle_xp_should_be_shared_amongst_crew/,"I've seen a thousand debates about PS2, with all of them having people on different sides arguing for or against something. Except shared XP for vehicles - that's the single issue that everyone seemed to agree on, and yet here we are, 7 months later, and it's not a thing.

Multi-crewing vehicles is one of the most fun aspects of playing a game like this and it should be encouraged. But certain roles in certain vehicles are extremely unrewarding from a score/xp perspective.

I feel guilty asking people to tail gun my lib. It was a valuable role, they'd contribute just as much time to the mission as the pilot and gunner, but they'd be lucky to get a few hundred XP per mission if they shot down an aircraft or two. It was a completely unrewarding role. The pilot of the lib does not receive as much XP as the gunner, but at least he'd get something to make it worthwhile. But a three man lib is more capable and more fun than a two man, so someone has to volunteer to take the crappy job.

With tanks, the tank driver is already the guy racking up the most points, so it's strange that the driver gets rewarded when the gunner makes a kill, but not the other way around. Gunning a tank is more worthwhile than tailgunning a lib, but nowhere near as much as pulling your own tank.

Recently, I've begun 3-manning harassers with friends. The guy in the third seat plays a valuable role but gets screwed again. He'll get the fewest kills by far, he'll die the most, and barely get rewarded. But he's a valuable member of the crew, he can bring repairs, or increase the vehicle firepower with a max.

All members of a vehicle crew should receive XP benefits from the accomplishments of the vehicle. This can disclude passengers in a sunderer or galaxy since they aren't really crew. I would suggest they all get equal XP - they're all putting equal time into the vehicle and all serving a purpose. But if you aren't willing to go that far, the other crew members should at least get the assist points that a lib pilot/tank driver would get if their gunner kills someone.

Multi-crewed vehicles are the best part of this game, the teamwork should be encouraged both to get more people filling up vehicles with crew and to reward the guys performing the less action-oriented support roles already.

1. You shouldn't get any grief for killing people when you spawn a vehicle and it decides to run over a bunch of noobs hanging out on the vehicle pad because you aren't in control.

2. Vehicle horns would be a nice feature and would help alert infantry on the ground and encourage them to move out of your way.

3. Headlights don't help much in Planetside 2, they mostly make it easier for enemies to see you, not the other way around. I'm not saying get rid of them, but how about a option in the settings for if you want them off by default, you could add in a option for default vehicle permissions as well.

4. Shield Generator/SCU exploding shouldn't cause grief.

So, does everyone support these? I think these are easy enough issues that smedley can hit them out of the park. For extra bonus points the dev team can look into why it's so much easier to run over friendlies compared to enemies.

First of all, I've said this before a few times so i'm sorry if it seems redundant: I'm so impressed and grateful with/for this sub and it's community. I only comment here rarely these days, but I'm on here absolutely constantly, and in the last year we've watched this sub go from low hundreds of PlanetSiders to almost 10,000 and that's just amazing.  So from the whole PS2 team, huge thank you to everyone here for your interest and passion about the game. 


Now that the NDA has been lifted we've been seeing some really cool stuff, from kickass gameplay streams, creative videos, screenshots of funny if sometimes slightly embarassing bugs and a lot of helpful and (more often than not) insightful gameplay feedback.  I wanted to try something a little different to see how it works, not quite an AMA, but more like a ""Whats up with that?"" (WUWT?) of top gameplay issues.  So here goes, ITT post things that you are annoyed by, worried about or curious about and I'll do my best (where I can) to let you know what our plans currently are to address the issues.  I'm going to be going purely off comment upvotes, so if you see something you agree with... well, you get the idea. 


I'm really hoping this can spark some interesting conversations about where the game is heading and what our current priorities in development are, and how they're matching up with what the community needs from us.  If this is cool maybe we can make it a monthly thing as we continue through beta and into the live game!

As a Planetside enthusiast, I am outright BEGGING you to focus less energy on releasing new content (specifically weapons, skins, and other SC dumps) until the current gameplay is fixed/optimized. I doubt I'm alone in my frustration with the current performance issues, weapon imbalances, and miscellaneous bugs that currently plague the fundamentals of gameplay.

I am one of your most stalwart fans. I cannot help but feel like I am becoming part of a ""crutch"" group of players; crutch in the sense that I refuse to stop supporting your game (both socially and financially), despite my current dissatisfaction with some very rudimentary issues with gameplay.

I trust in your vision for PS2, but have sincere concerns about the longevity of the game given recent events. I'm not going to bother going into details about every issue - you know what they are - but would rather like to use the new ES rocket launchers as an example (*Please note, I have no opinion either way on the balance of the launchers*). My main concern is the resource allocation that has been devoted into not only introducing the new launchers, but also the subsequent patching and balancing efforts. While new content has been and continues to be great, it feels more like a shiny distraction to take focus away from the basic ""polishing"" efforts that are paramount to this game's success.

With over 100K Station Cash spent on my account, I can assure you that there is plenty of paid content at this point in time. Please help me feel like I'm not throwing that money down the drain. I believe we all need some better communication on your dedication to ironing out the gameplay issues, with a little less spotlight on NEW NEW SHINY NEW stuff. It's a bandaid over festering wounds (apologies for the graphic analogy).

**TL;DR: Rather than implementing, patching, and balancing new content/features, please prioritize the existing issues.**

Sincerely,

Greg

The issue here is incentive.",Thjoth,569,155,139,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/160pjb/people_forget_that_ps1_also_had_a_kd_count/,"This was a reply in the latest anti-K:D circlejerk thread, but I'm making it a selfpost to try to get the message out there, because going after the K:D stat is just going after a symptom to an actual problem.  It will do nothing whatsoever to solve the actual problem.

K:D was, in fact, one of only four stats that were tracked at all in PS1, along with BEP, CEP, and SEP (Battle Experience Points, Command Experience Points, Support Experience Points).  However, people didn't really pay that much attention to it, and everyone knew it didn't matter that much.

The whole reason K/D is such a huge deal to a lot of people right now is that, along with score per hour, it's basically the only metric you can use to gauge your success. In PS1, a combination of the metagame itself and the amount of XP (BEP/CEP/SEP) you gained per play session from said metagame kept the K/D from being that huge of a deal. Dying several times in the process of advancing the metagame often netted you more experience points than getting 10 or 15 kills, and the territory you flipped in the process would remain yours for a substantial amount of time.

My suggestion would be to bring back three aspects of PS1's XP system. First, put a multiplier on how much XP you get for capturing a base (or destroying a sundie) based on how much enemy activity was in the influence area of said base or sundie. This should happen on bases of all sizes, and should also apply to the defenders resecuring a base with enemy activity inside the hex.

Second, put a multiplier on XP gained from killing enemies that are more dangerous (as measured by the amount of XP and/or kills that they have racked up during their current life) or have been alive for longer; killing Cowpie Clyde on the NC who's just been standing around holding his dick in the spawn should net very little XP, while murdering the shit out of BuzzcutPsycho should be worth substantially more. In PS1, killing some of the most dangerous players could net you as much BEP as capturing a minor base.

Third, bring back SEP. For those that don't know what that is, SEP worked by giving you a small percentage of all of the XP gained by people that you supported for a short time after that support action took place. If a person spawns at your sundie, for example, for 1-2 minutes after that support action took place, you'd receive something like 1% of the XP they gained by killing or supporting others. This would not, of course, be subtracted from their XP as you wouldn't want to penalize them in any way, but would simply be delivered to you.

There should not be a flat rate of XP gained for ANYTHING, except maybe destroying turrets or hacking terminals. EVERY ACTION is situational, so every XP gain should be situational through multipliers.

Everyone is demonizing the reliance on K/D, but it's just a symptom of the actual problems, which are a lack of a metagame incentive/persistence, and a lack of support incentive.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,False,,vs,True,t3_160pjb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/160pjb/people_forget_that_ps1_also_had_a_kd_count/,
1361965697.0,406,self.Planetside,19bm73,How to fix the zerg in 3 easy steps.,Worldwithoutwings2,527,121,297,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/19bm73/how_to_fix_the_zerg_in_3_easy_steps/,"We all know what a zerg is, a blob of tanks, infantry, sunderers, lib's and esf's surge deep into enemy territory, steamrolling and capturing.

Ever heard of a equivalent in real life military tactics? Nope. And there is a reason why. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encirclement

The attacking force gets cut off from its supply and reinforcements, it has two choices, either fight its way back to connect with the supply lines, or obliterate the enemy with what it has. If it dosen't do that, then this happens

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad#The_Subjugation_of_the_Sixth_Army 

But this doesn't work in planetside 2, it doesn't matter if you are cut off from enemy territory, you can still reinforce(respawn) and resupply (repair and rearm). So the zerg will just keep going and doesn't have to worry about defending the territory it has captured.

I propose three things to change this.

1. No working spawn tubes or terminals territories that have been disconnected from the warpgate. (Another, possibly harsh, effect would be to freeze vehicle counters for players in cut off territories, or enemy territories not on the front line.)

2. Sunderers can only deploy AMS in territory connected to the warp gate or enemy territory that have friendly influence (i.e. on the frontline)

3. Vehicles cannot resupply in sectors that have been cut off. Engineers and ammo sundies will only have a limited amount of ammo (say two packs of ammo) and cannot deploy more than that until they have returned to connected territory.



These three changes should have the following effects:

Zerging into enemy territory is now a big risk. If you get cut off you will start to bleed dry of men and supplies.

Zergs will need to leave men behind to protect their supply route, this means the zerg will get smaller and smaller the deeper it goes.

Defending against a zerg now can be done waving them by, cutting them off and bleeding them out. You don't have to stand and fight and get steamrolled in base after base.

Eventually people will realize it is no longer a viable tactic to rush headlong into enemy territory and will try to push a front line instead of a point.

However, if we want we can go up another level of realism, and develop some really cool stuff to make the zerg viable but only with hard work. For example, allow galaxies to carry giant ammo crates, so that they can carry supplies to pockets of troops that have been cut off, likewise, you could award points for each player delivered to cut off, occupied, territories.

Basically resupplying by airlift, like they tried in Stalingrad.

Anyway, those are my suggestions for fixing a aspect of the game that I really don't like. Most of these suggestions i have seen in one form or another suggested by others, I don't claim them to be original. 

If you like them upvote and maybe the SOE guys that frequent this reddit will see them.



Edit: Great discussion going on here, I love talking about game mechanics and emergent behaviors.

u/Thingamyjib Suggested that it was a bit harsh to just kill the spawn tubes instantly, at the speed the game moves you would probably wipe out a cut off force too quickly, this would cause sieges to end too quickly also. So as a compromise i suggest you put either a limited number of spawns on the tubes once they have been cut off, or a timer. Perhaps make it possible to reset the timer or number of respawns by a supply drop.  

Another edit: Many people saying, or implying, that the zerg will always be there. True, it's human nature, people who don't want to think will just roll with the flow. And that's cool there should be room for players who want to do that if they want, they shouldn't have to log in and play chess. But the mindlessness of the tactic should not be so game changing and should be counter-able by playing smart.

Planetside 2 continues to be a fundamentally good game, It still has problems which prevent it from being truly great. This post is going to be long but I would really appreciate it if you read it, commented on it and offered your opinions and support.


**BATTLE FLOW - WHERE IS IT?**


The big problems which must be addressed are the how battles flow across a continent, universal player annoyances which detract from the game play, and when you’re fighting over a base in Planetside 2, the big problem right now lies in the aftermath of the actual fighting when the attacker begins camping the defender inside the spawn rooms. This creates a situation with guys outside the shield and the guys inside the shield, both waiting to just snag some cheesy kills. The giant problem with this is that there can be just one guy inside that invulnerable spawn room and the attackers still must camp it; after all, that one defender can repair the SCU and the generator as soon as the attackers leave to actually do something productive. It’s not that the attackers want to camp him, it’s that they have to camp him.


My suggestion here is to implement a “pain field” once the SCU gets destroyed. Specifically, with the destruction of the SCU, a pain field would turn on inside the spawn room and push any remaining defenders out of it. No more motivation for the defenders to get cheesy kills while the capture timer slowly runs down. The reason it is essential to kick defenders out of the cheesy spawn room camp is actually two fold; in addition to ending the unproductive requirement for attackers to camp the spawn, it contributes to the overall flow of battle when combined with my next suggestion. To set the scenario up, the SCU gets destroyed, the pain fields turn on and kicks the defenders out, but then what happens?

In the current game, the defenders are dispersed all over the continent by virtue of the fact that they have a plethora of redeployment options to choose from. This seemingly positive example of improved player choice actually contributes to the flow of battle and thus the overall player experience. Planetside 2 is a game about big battles, and players want to be in a big battle as often as possible. When the defenders are allowed to disperse all over the continent, they destroy the flow because there are too many options to have a centralized fall back point where a new defense can be mounted.

Whenever a large defending force is destroyed, the attackers win both the facility and a large degree of momentum. The defenders, on the other hand, are thrown all over the place and unable to mount an effective defense, or an effective attempt at a re-secure, from another territory.

I would like to clarify what I mean by momentum actually. Momentum, as I see it exhibited in this game, is gained by the attackers because the defenders continually get dispersed by each territory they lose due to the current deployment mechanics. Thus, as the defenders continue to lose in increasing magnitude, they end up abandoning the idea of defending altogether. To put it simply, it’s a failure spiral for them because there are less defenders available in the relevant territories each time due to the dispersion effect I just described. Eventually, the attackers not only don’t get the big fights they want, but it gets as bad as being relegated to ghost hacking an empty territory.

My suggestion for this is to change the deployment options to only adjacent territories which you are physically connected to via the map plus the warp gate. The reason for this is simple: it will create a more focused fall back point for the defense and a clear avenue of attack which even a new or casual player will be able to easily identify. As an example, let’s say you are TR attacking Quartz Ridge and push the NC defenders out. The NC will have the option to re-spawn at Indar Comm Array, Indar Excavation site, or the warp gate. This will help to create a real front, but we’re not done just yet.

In order to help facilitate both the death of the boring spawn room camp, and the creation of the front I just described, we must install SCU’s in every facility in the game. As it stands now, small outposts do not have SCU’s; once again, you are forced to camp the enemy inside the spawn rooms, promoting that cheesy gameplay which isn’t fun for anyone.

My suggestion would function the same way as it does in a big base: pain fields would activate and kick defenders out upon the SCU’s destruction. Keep in mind, SCU’s do not have to overload quickly. Some of us probably remember back in the early days of beta when every outpost had an SCU when they were destroyed by simple gunfire. The reason they were removed back then was because they were destroyed too quickly; they changed the system, however, and the current overload system for SCU’s and generators works great in the current game.

With SCU’s added to every facility in the game and utilizing the current, effective overload system, a secondary objective will be created at every facility which encourages more tiered and focused gameplay. Secondary objectives are incredibly important for this game, especially with regards to facilities.

Secondary objectives are extremely important for fun. We joke around about the “spawn camp metagame” as the only current objective for an attacker is to push defenders into the spawn room and camp them there. While the defenders are waiting for cheap kills, they’re not falling back and setting up defenses; this goes back to the dispersion and flow problems.

Let me give another example to highlight how I envision this unfolding. Let’s say the TR are attacking the VS at Feldspar Canyon. The TR push, end up assaulting the SCU, and finally destroy it. Painfields activate in the tower and the defenders are pushed out and have to choose where to spawn. As the only friendly territory connected with Feldspar Canyon is Old Auraxium mines; this means the VS have the option to spawn at Old Auraxium Mines or the warp gate.

What this does is promote a direction, a flow, to the battle. The TR will know that the VS are at Old Auraxium Mines and the VS will know that the TR are coming to Old Auraxium Mines. Both sides know they will get their fight at Old Auraxium Mines.

This is still not enough, however. We want battles to last, but we also want them to be stable. What this means is, having random factors, such as the influence system in its current implementation, suddenly and for reasons a player fighting inside a territory cannot fathom, suddenly swing the capture timer in one direction or another is bad for the game. The biggest culprit in a base capturing too quickly is the influence system.

* *Open-field battles*: **FUN!** Open field battles with every sort of infantry/ground/air unit involved are hugely fun to play in. A shame they appear to be so rare, everything almost always happens at bases instead. 
* *Camping spawn rooms*: **NOT FUN**. This stage of a battle often takes several minutes, and isn't much fun on either side of the battle. 
* *Core combat*: **FUN!** Infantry combat especially feels great, vehicle fighting is mostly fun as well. 
* *Playing as Combat Medic*: **FUN!** Kudos to SOE for making a healer class that is actually a lot of fun to play and easy to be moderately effective at from the get-go. 
* *Flying things*: **FUN!** Air units are quite fun to drive.
* *Fighting from the air*: **NOT FUN**. While flying is fun, trying to fight from the air feels very frustrating. Usually I can't tell what's shooting me or from where and then die pretty quickly. Even if I do manage to draw a bead on a vehicle target, it takes quite a while to gun them down. Some of this may get better with experience and certs spent on better weapons, but currently ranks as Not Fun.
* *Teamwork*: **FUN!** The game does a great job at making it easy to jump into a squad and coordinate your efforts. Teamwork is fun AND effective!
* *Lack of interesting objectives*: **NOT FUN.** Taking bases doesn't seem to provide any meaningful bonus, and there is no long term objective or real win condition outside of the alerts. There's no supply chain or resource gathering to disrupt, no important targets to destroy, nothing but capture and defend. I can't help but feel like there is a ton of unrealized potential here... 
* *Resource system*: **NOT FUN.** What's the point? I've never NOT had enough of a resource to buy something I wanted (the timer is always the constraint there).
* *Uneven continent distribution*: **NOT FUN.** Why all the hate for Amerish? 
* *Free game!*: **FUN!** Amazing game to be able to get and play for free, with upgrades that grind *just* slow enough to tempt you to buy them with cash instead. Came in worried that I would either have to grind forever or fork out cash to be able to play effectively, ended up pleasantly surprised. 
* *Nonrendering infantry*: **NOT FUN.** While overall I'm quite happy with how the netcode seems to behave, it's extremely frustrating to draw a bead on a distant infantry target, then have them disappear, then reappear and shoot me in the head after I've turned my attention elsewhere. 

Thanks for listening! Not sure if SOE reads this or not, but if so, thanks for the fantastic game!

SOE, could you go further and stop doing stealth changes ? There is *a lot* of changes which aren't in the patch note. 

For example :

* Infiltrator cloak being more visible on low graphical settings

* Added countdowns in vehicle tab

* Added ""You are being revived"" message on death screen

* /who command removed

* Infiltrators don't display on IRNV scopes anymore

* New sounds for some TR rifles

* From what I heard, NC weapons recoil was reduced

I don't think anyone will be upset about the vehicle countdowns or the medic revival message, but game-changing stealth changes like those applied to Infiltrators *have* to be written down.

Please SOE!,DogOMatic4000,423,45,134,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1br06s/been_a_platoon_leader_for_a_few_months_these/,"I know that adding features for the relatively few people that run platoons is probably not seen as a priority, but platoon leaders make a big difference in giving people a good gaming experience.  They can be assisting dozens of players at once and SOE should make their jobs easier in exchange for all their organizational efforts. I am very frustrated with having to work around the limitations of the platoon/squad leader system.

This happens often:  ""Hey, SuperNoob420 I got disconnected can you please make me squad leader and then platoon leader?  You have to do it in that order or it won't work.""  ""Hey, are you there?"" ""Hello!!"" ""Sorry guys, we'll have to disband the platoon and start a new one.""

This is what I need to make platoon management...well, managable:

- The ability to make myself a squad leader.
- The ability to see squad names and rename them or make them public/private.
- The ability to ban someone permanently from squads under my command (eliminating screaming voice grievers).
- Priority override for in-game voice.
- Ability to see and reset the waypoints for each squad.
- Ability to check off people that can be automatically promoted to platoon and squad leader if I or a squad leader drops connection.

1372074219.0,375,self.Planetside,1gyouy,The other side or why your faction doesn't suck as much as you think - Spreading positivity to the subreddit,bouncyboing,464,89,278,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1gyouy/the_other_side_or_why_your_faction_doesnt_suck_as/,"I was forever picking fault with the NC and screaming over powered at the other factions. So I decided, I gotta try it out and see what it's all about on the other side. The experience was eye opening to the strengths of my home faction and the weaknesses of my enemies. So if you bear with me, I'd like to share my experiences with the community. 

To begin with I made the mistake of rolling my alt characters on servers that were already over populated by the factions I choose. So the factions I joined just zerged instead of using tactics. (Sorry you guys on these factions on these servers but zerging is easy - sheer numbers will hammerblow any tactical superiority.) I have a TR on Miller and a VS on Woodman. Both low level so I will re-roll them in the opposite direction. VS on Miller and TR on Woodman. I rolled heavies on both sides and tried out both tanks as this is my comfort zone when I play NC.

BR 52 NC as main. Before I tried the other sides, I hated our low rof guns with high bloom, crap hip firing and overall feel to them. I love our tank, it feels like a powerhouse and very tanky. Only started playing it after they nerfed the HE so never got to be a HE farmer. Went AP and Enforcer and specifically play as anti armour and love to charge in with overpowered shield up decimating the enemy tanks. Magriders can be tough to hit at range with their strafing, prowlers are xp pinatas waiting to burst.

So I tried TR first. Joined a zergy TR and zergy is never fun. Outnumbering your enemy means no tactics and sheer numbers to win. The LMG feels nice to shoot, easy to control but hits like a wet fish. Where did my damage go? The rof is amazing. The guns shoot so damn fast! Controlled burst fire is so rewarding with this gun! I trialed the Chaingun just to run around screaming HERE COMES OL' PAINLESS! Was fun to use but the windup prevented me from getting the most out of it. When I did get the windup in time, it was hilarious to see corpses dropping in a tight hallway.

The Prowler feels wrong. It's not tanky enough to sit still and shell the enemy. It feels like I have already maxed out Rival Combat Chassi on it, with its fast turning and good acceleration. I feel like it wants to be a shock tank, sneaking behind enemy lines and bursting down armour. The burst fire with twin barrels and Vulcan has devastating potential. Its speed, compact size and turning circle definitely makes it feels like it wants to play a different role than sitting still. Oh and its armour felt atrocious after being inside a Vanguard for so long. I usually hear the plink, plink of a tank buster when they fly overhead, but the Prowler went boom before I heard the first plink. And the Vulcan just felt plain bad at range when in lockdown. The Vulcan wants to be a shock weapon too! The whole concept of the Prowler is wrong and I feel bad for you guys. It wants to be a shock tank but it is told to be a long range artillery bombardment war machine.

The VS. It's weird having weapons that shoot where you tell them too. Recoil is manageable and the bullets land where the crosshair is. That being said it had crap damage. Again. Losing rof AND damage in exchange for no bullet damage means close range is a dicey experience. No damage to burst down in close range and no rof to make up for the lack of damage. Definitely felt like a medium to long range gun. The LMG felt nice to use at range but ammo ran out so damn fast. Small magazine size but phenomenally fast reload time was a double edged sword in encounters below medium range. The dumbfire rocket launcher felt different somehow but I couldn't place my finger on it. Just different. Despite being fun to shoot with, they lacked the punch (again) that I have grown so accustomed to from my NC weapons.

The Magrider I could not get to grips with. The steering and the strafing is a something that requires lots of practice to be good with. The vanguard and prowler were just sit in and go. Bang you got it. The Magrider requires a whole different skill set to drive and I now hold the talented Magrider strafers in high esteem. It was not easy to get it right first time like the others. The cannon was nothing short of a lesson in a frustration. To get the most from it you really had to understand the movement of the tank which is a skillset I do not possess. What I did love however was the Magriders ability to scale some amazingly steep inclines. You can get to advantageous elevated positions thanks to how it handles steep hills and perhaps that is why the cannon is fixed in place due to this positional advantage it can gain. The Saron was an amazing weapon to use and perfect for long ranging sniping armour. Combine this with the Magriders ability to reach places other tanks can't go and you have a fantastic armour sniping machine.

After these adventures I went home to NC and by god it felt good to have the Gauss SAW in my hands again. Sure the bullets go all over the place when I shoot it, but they hurt when they hit! None of this silly rof increase in exchange for damage or lack of bullet drop in exchange for damage. Just straight up, in your face, hard hitting gun.

The Vanguard has no identity crisis whatsoever. It knows what it wants to be and it excels all too well in this role. The Magrider is an awesome sniper tank. Knows what it wants to be and when played well, is a great sniping machine dodging income enemy fire with smart use of strafing. The Prowler is just wrong on too many levels. If it wants to be a long range bombardier it needs armour and it needs a better faction specific secondary. But it doesn't feel like a long range machine. It wants to get in close, darting in and out. It's compact, fast and agile! Let it be what it wants to be and make it a shock tank. My Prowler is definitely going to be certed in this direction. Radar will replace lockdown and it will let me see my enemies and make those raiding attacks with a Vulcan gunner all the easier to execute. Stealth is another option I am looking into. I know the Prowler wants to be this and I am gonna let it be what it wants to be.

NC have it good. We have awesome weapons that require investment to get good use from them but reward you greatly when you have invested enough in them. We have great tanks and knowing my enemies strengths and weaknesses has only made me a stronger player.

Play the other sides. Learn your enemies weaknesses. Exploit them!

* It doesnt have to be permanent, just perhaps a 1 week window like any other time limited promotion we see.

* Weapons bought with certs can be excluded.

* SOE can charge a small fee for the privilege.


Ok this isnt a new request but over the several posts ive seen on this subject the same few objections come up.  Dont hate on me for #2 but id rather we see some kind of agreement to move forward, than keep asking and have SOE keep saying hmm we will have to work out the details.

These are the details.

People worry about players being able to re-cert over and over. Answer, make it limited for the week (or long weekend) like other deals we see.

SOE want to lock people into certain purchases, refunding weapons may go against that and cause them to pause. Answer lets exclude them and have back all the certs NOT attached to a weapon purchase.  Id rather have this than currently, nothing at all.

And of course the fee, it shouldnt be too low, SOE arent going to have a champagne party from a few thousand recert fees but it should be high enough to represent a convenience and not an entitlement.

Lastly, with all the recent fractures in the community over everything from lattice/hex/resources/cap conditions/ZOE/shotguns/TDM/higbys hair etc etc etc this needs to be pushed up the priority list FAST. Give us something to be pleased about and reward our time and patience suffering all these changes.

Watching games evolve from the simple tape deck console to the Apple was a huge step.

[Arctic Fox](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPsOOYZs7Bg) was the first simulator type game that blew me away with its realism!

Choplifter, Leisure Suit Larry and Space Quest I filled my weekends with hours of fun.

When Doom and Castle Wolfenstein 3D came out, they marked what I thought was the pinnacle of FPS, it could never get better!

I vividly remember telling my younger brother that one day in the future there would be games where you could go around shooting like in Doom, then hop in vehicle like a plane and fly around! This was the stuff dreams were made of back then.

Fast forward to today, Im flying around in a mozzy, take fire from an AA, land just before it blows up. Hop into a party bus, jump out at a terminal and spawn a tank, get blown up. Come back as a sniper, shoot some purple guys, go back into another mozzy, all within 20min.

All this for free! 

While PS2 is riddled with bugs and has a lot of room for improvement, take a moment to realize how amazing this is and how far we have come in the past 30yrs!

Now get off my lawn!

I noticed this multiple times last night and this morning while playing. Operatives completely ruining what was a well coordinated assault on a base, whether intentionally or not. I really can't believe nobody thought this problem through before implementing them...

When there's a battle going on and our empire is storming a front and pushing forward, then an enemy Light Assault flies into OUR held territory, it causes a swarm of what would be soldiers pushing forward to keep our fight going to turn around and start shooting at this oblivious asshole who can't be killed, who just stands there on top of our spawn room with no fucks given about what he's doing to the balance of the fight.

What's worse is when they intentionally drop into a large group of enemies in a hot zone causing massive amounts of friendly fire and teamkilling as people try harder and harder to kill this enemy who has dropped right into our laps.

There is no reason why you can't make these operatives invisible. If that's not an option then they need to be displayed as friendly to EVERYONE or they need to be killable.

This is the first time I've actually wanted to rage quit this game. When we lose our footing on a ridge because SOE employees see fit to destroy the balance of a very even fight using GM powers I don't even want to fucking bother.

I've heaved heavy praise of SOE since early beta for the way they've run this game and I'm very happy that they're taking cheaters seriously. But really, guys, my brain is absolutely full of fuck over the thought that nobody realized dropping an invincible soldier into enemy territory during a raging back-and-forth stalemate wouldn't have any affect on our gameplay. You guys have observation mode, I've seen it used for the Friday Ops.

I could talk about the nice graphics or the epic scenes as people fly around, send off explosions into the air, trail ships with anti-air as they fly majestically (or not so majestically) through the air (or into buildings).

But honestly, the biggest thing for me is that every single fight is awesome. Whether I'm dealing with a couple infiltrators trying to take down the twin generators before the rest of their tank column and my side's reinforcements hopefully arrive or it's holding that point right outside of the enemy's portal until we can nab the last point on their continent with nothing more than tank mines and a hidden sunderer for the flanks, I never seem to lose interest in the fights. Grinding isn't tedious. I'm not looking for people to headshot 4 times in a row in private just to up my stats. I'm not looking at my guns to see which one I'm closest to a medal in.

I've gotten behind 4 engineers in a MAX suit healing orgy. I've geared up in a tank with 80 other people to break a siege.

I've grouped up with an outfit and went on point grabbing runs, defended a triple point base with 4 friends and 2 AA turrets, set up C4 and then blew the hell out of an approaching tank column.

This is the kind of shit you have to script in an FPS, but it just seems to *emerge.*

I ran past two enemy tanks, two turrets, and three gunning heavies who didn't have time to see me, just so I could repair a generator on the other side of the base.

SOE, Do not implement this change without first revamping the whole resource system.",RoyAwesome,454,109,322,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1ge283/the_proposed_resource_cost_changes_will_break_the/,"So, to those who don't normally talk to me, I very clearly see the resource system as meerly a system that extends cooldown timers for vehicles when you are losing the continent. 

So, I phrased the resource cost changes as how long it will take for you to get certain items and to do that, I added up the 'Average' incomes for each of the factions on each continent.  I also added up the 'Easy' resources for those factions (Easy being resources 1 or 2 links away from the WG).  The numbers I got painted a very very dire picture for any faction with below average territory.  

The numbers: http://hastebin.com/xawewarexu.txt

What I have found is that with Average Territory, you gain resources at roughly the same rate that the default cooldown is.  This calls into question why the Vehicle Cooldown Timer certs exist with these changes, as vehicles like the MBTs will take 15 minutes of passive gain to re-pull from full resources.  

However, once you have less than average territory, that's when things get interesting:

So, lets propose a situation.  The NC push in from the north on Indar, taking the northern territories from the TR, including TI-Alloys and Allatum Biolab.  They also take the immediate bases around the biolab to secure their hold on it.  The TR now have 16 infantry resource income every 5 minutes.  As a player on the TR, you can now pull a Max 2 times from full resources (you can purchase 1 grenade).   Once you do that, with 16 resources per tick, now must wait **95 minutes** to pull another MAX suit.  

The numbers don't get better.  If a faction is push down to only the area surrounding the warpgate, MBTs will take **30-40 minutes** (depending on the WG) to pull again, and  **nearly 3 hours** to be able to pull again after that.  

The most important one, AMS Sunderers.  If you are pushed down to your easy territories, it takes from **15-35 minutes** to pull a second Sunderer after yours dies.  If you pull this second Sunderer and it, too, dies, you must now wait anywhere from **1.5 hours to 3 hours** (depending on the continent/WG) to pull another Sunderer.  At that point, just log off.  

TL;DR: The proposed resource costs will turn a losing situation into a 'Log off this game fucking sucks' situation.

It fosters bad teamwork and gameplay mechanics.,phukka,511,179,220,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/14mzh8/remove_the_kd_display_it_fosters_bad_teamwork_and/,"There is no reason to have a K:D monitor in the game.  Bragging rights for K:D are meaningless and are heavily skewed due to vehicle combat.  A player that primarily plays as infantry will always have a significantly lower K:D ratio than an ESF pilot, for example, and in the interest of competitiveness will change his playstyle to limit deaths.  This does not equate to fun gameplay, engaging gameplay, or good teamwork habits.

Also, you would obviously have to remove display of deaths, as it's far too easy to figure out your ratios if you have both a kill stat and a death stat.  

Obviously this is a complete non-issue for some people, but for others like me, it significantly changes the way I play the game.  I look at K:D as validation that I'm playing well, but your ability to be successful in Planetside has nothing to do with your ratios.  

I felt the same way about HLStats in CSS and actually started to avoid server that ran HLStats because it encouraged bad habits for me.  I would rather be able to get on and play without having my ratio present in my mind, encouraging me to play smarter or safer.  Sometimes the best action is a Mary Poppin's drop into a Tech Plant, but that's terrible for K:D, so I'll find myself not helping the rush sometimes.

We decided to take the amp station and were making great progress.  After working our way in, getting sundies deployed, and the generators offline, it seemed as though we had a slam dunk on our hands.

Nope.

In the course of about 15 seconds each and every one of our sunderers in the base were TK'd by friendly C4, and the bombers immediately logged.  Shortly *after* this, the entire VS counter-attack-in-waiting marches in.

Complete and utter bullshit.  If that's what it took for you to win, you suck not only at this game but you're essentially the sorest excuse of a person out there.

*  Coordinated abuse of TK'ing is not ""skill.""
*  The fact you had no other options to avoid losing the facility, against a numerically *inferior* force, just shows how hard you blew that defense.

Utter bullshit, plain and simple.  We reported every name we could get from reliable witnesses.  

I could give very few fucks, we all took it anyway, and we basically wrote you off as useless to your faction.  Do what you will, in the end we still laughed *and* kicked your ass.  

On a serious note, however, this isn't the first suspicion of this type of event I've seen.  I think SoE needs to seriously reconsider the multiple-per-server idea.  If only to force someone to log into another account just to make doing such a thing more annoying.

The gunner will cert twice as fast as the pilot.  Why? Because he gets points for assists, turret kills, ect while the pilot does not.  Why is it that the pilot must spend thousands of certs for someone else to benefit the most?  That seems kind of wrong to me.  

If the the gunners are getting points the pilot should also get points, no matter what.  Its his investment so he should see some reward.  Right now its not balanced enough, and their certainly is not enough reward for the cost.  


Edit: Just thought I would share some raw numbers with you.  Played with Roommate doing liberator runs last night.  

I have 50% Exp boost, with 50% exp boost from 6 month member.  Giving me a total of 100%(110% when defending). I am the pilot.

He has no boost, no membership(my gunner).

At around the time it takes me to get 50 certs from him gunning he netted 112.  Ill say that again.  I have 100% exp boost.  He does not.  He certs twice as fast as me, and I am the one with the 700+ investment in my Liberator.  What the absolute fuck...?

Exp should be shared in liberators between all.  If anything the pilot should be rewarded for his investment, and right now its a joke.  I used to think it was good before i actually looked over at my friends screen and saw the real truth.  Liberator pilots get shafted.  

Any SoE feedback?

1352960765.0,310,self.Planetside,1388d9,I give in: Cert gain it too slow. Looking down at your cert points after three hours of harsh fighting feels like a let down. ,FrankManic,372,62,274,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1388d9/i_give_in_cert_gain_it_too_slow_looking_down_at/,"NOTE:

- Firstly, this isn't about F2P vs. Paid accounts. It's about the perceived effort vs. rewards. For F2P to work players have to enjoy the game and be invested in it over the long term. The best way to build up the psychological desire for that sort of long term investment is positive reinforcement by providing a steady, but not guaranteed supply of rewards. This is basic behavioral psychology. You need to give your monkey rewards some of the time, but not all the time. If you give the monkey rewards too often it will take the reward for granted, knowing that it can get the reward any time it wants. Then it loses interest. If you don't give the monkey enough reward it will get frustrated, and find something else to do. 

- To keep the monkey interested you need to find a sweet spot. The monkey needs to know that it *will* get a reward, but not *when*. And the reward needs to come often enough that it's still a pleasurable memory for the monkey, without coming so frequently that it becomes normal. 

- The monkey needs to make an effort. Too little effort and the reward becomes common and loses it's value. Too much effort and the reward isn't worth the effort it takes to earn. 

- Right now the Monkey feels that it is not being rewarded. After completing a difficult, time consuming puzzle the Monkey wants a reward that it feels is worth the effort put in to the puzzle. Right now the monkey, or at least this monkey, feels he's not getting a worthwhile reward. 

- It doesn't matter if the player is paying or not. The game relies on free players to keep the server population high and allow the game systems to work properly. For paid players to enjoy themselves there needs to be a minimum population that can keep battles going. For non-paying players to want to invest money in the game they have to be enjoying gameplay *before* they put any money in. To keep both populations player you need to have a progression system that provides a positive reinforcement; When you play the game you are rewarded for playing the game in a manner that is satisfying to the player.

TEST, AT, and a few others spent the last few hours getting pushed back across Amerish by a truly massive NC force. At ~8pm we were capping Mekala. By midnight a huge, well organized NC force had pushed us back to the warpgate. It was hours and hours of constant, unrelenting fighting as we struggled to resist overwhelming numbers. We executed flawless combined pod drops to ambush and destroy NC Sunderers. We pulled armor columns to blunt the enemy rush. We sent spec ops teams wide around to cut off enemy reinforcements. We did pretty well anything. It was exhilerating and watching dozens of players smashing away at each other fits the definition of Epic.

Then I looked at my cert points. 

During that whole many hours long battle I accrued 18 cert points. 

That took the wind out of my sails. All of that fighting and I didn't pull enough certs for even a low level upgrade. I was rather expecting to see 50 or 60. Enough to grab a mid level upgrade or an attachment. I certainly wasn't slacking. I took out several sunderers, killed twenty or thirty people, spent a lot of time in an engineer kit providing ammo, and generally fought the fight. Put my total points came in quite low.

Some thoughts

- Put defense XP back in. It's nice to get some little acknowledgement when you take back the facility. Sometimes that amounts to five or six minutes sitting on the point *not* fighting. The battle is outside the walls, while you're sitting on the point getting no XP, but doing something important for the squad. 

- Bring back control point flip XP. Again, someone has to do it, but there's no reward for it. 

- Bring back ticket point control for some installations. In certain bases Tug of War ends up taking forever, forcing your squad to sit around doing nothing until the cap goes through. It's not as bad for larger installations, but sitting through the whole process at uncontested minor bases is very frustrating

- Reduce the XP per cert. I broadly agree that the prices are alright. Prior to tonight I'd thought that the XP gains where in about the right place - You spend a few hours playing, you get a decent pot of certs, you can pick up an upgrade or something and feel like you've achieved something. 

After tonight I no longer believe that. Hours of constant fighting should be a good baseline for what kind of experience gains you can expect under the best circumstances. In this case they were extremely disappointing. When you're badly outnumbered (tonight we figured it was somewhere between 2 and 4 to 1 against us) you have to put in a great deal of effort to achieve modest goals. That translates to very little XP being gained. You end up spending a lot of time shooting at sunderers, sitting on points, repairing things, and, most of all, dying constantly. You just can't beat 2 or 3 to one odds in a gunfight. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is

The battle felt heroic. This is as intense of a battle as you'll ever see in PS2. 

And the rewards felt pathetic. At this rate 18-20 hours of play might net me 100 certs. I tend to play low-return roles like squad lead, platoon lead, scout, and so forth. Even relatively high return roles - HA, LA, tank, AA, aren't able to get consistent kills when you're outnumbered that heavily. Likewise, I imagine the other team is getting little XP as the compete with four other people to get kill XP. 

It feels as though prior versions of the XP system saw you gaining a great deal of XP from capping and other activities. Now a large share of XP comes from getting kills. That's inconsistent at best. In pitched battles you do a huge amount of damage to the enemy and get almost nothing back for it simply because you're not landing killing shots. It's frustrating.

Finally: I would suggest that XP be shared throughout the squad and platoon. As it stands there are too many important roles that are not rewarded. One way to reduce the impact of that would be to share a percentage of XP with the entire squad or platoon. Squad leaders, especially, would stand to benefit as they spend a great deal of time in their maps, on comms, or babysitting sunderers. Some form of shared squad XP would reward players who take unpopular roles for the contribution they are making to the squad as a whole. 

TLDR; The current XP gain requires far too much effort for far too little reward. The slow XP gains and inconsistent XP gain from completing important objectives is frustrating to a degree that detracts from the enjoyment of the game.

Within 4 hours we got 50 members in the outfit, and after 4 weeks only 5 of them stuck around to play the game (note that we actually took effort to keep them in, it wasn't just mass invite and forget about it). Everyone else after 4 weeks had been inactive for more as 3 weeks on the outfit page and never came back.

PlanetSide 2 is a hard game to get into for most people, and I really think PlanetSide 2 needs a proper tutorial sooner than later. Yesterday I created a new NC and VS character:

* On my VS character I got put into one of those super small spawn rooms with a massive TR zerg outside, spawn die, spawn die.
* On my NC character I got put into a base where absolutely nothing was going on.

This is bad, there needs to be some sort of incentive for new players to actually stick around. I think a tutorial in video format should be added showing different kinds of gameplay and explaining the game, the tutorial which is at the test server right now just doesn't cut it.

* Explain the territory system and how it works
* Explain objectives, SCU's, generators etc
* Give players an incentive to stick around: show EPIC battle, teamwork etc
* Give more incentive to stick around: explain cert system, what they can unlock if they keep playing etc.

All this can be put in a 5 minute video, and could be the deciding factor for players, if they understand the game better and got a taste of whats to come they're more likely to stick around.

Optimization is another problem which should IMO be focused on for 1 or 2 months straight without any patches, but I won't go into that right now.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,False,,tr,True,t3_1dq31y,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1dq31y/new_players_join_the_game_and_leave_fast_soe_we/,

1. If you want to destroy a generator, the best way is to just fire on it with your primary weapon. Grenades also help and will take off a large chunk of generator health. When the generator starts flashing you're getting close to finishing it off. Note that due to damage fall-off over distance you will actually kill the generator a lot faster if you stand immediately next to it as you fire. If possible try to get your whole squad to work together to take it down because it takes a long time to do it on your own.

2. Sunderers actually can't take fall damage or be flipped over. Use this to your advantage when transporting your squad by taking shortcuts; it'll get you to your destination a lot faster as the roads are often inefficient for travel, particularly on Amerish.

3. If you're VS, try to stick close to nearby magriders for cover. Try to stay immediately behind them or to their sides. If they need to move past you, they can just safely glide over you.

4. As a medic, players are invulnerable for a short period of time after being rezzed, so you always want to try to rez them in the line of fire so they can serve as a shield. Also, make sure you go out of your way to heal MAXes, but be aware: you can't revive them.

5. As an engineer, make sure never to repair someone else's vehicle for them unless they explicitly ask you: you're stealing their repair exp and they'll likely get pissed. Also, repairing base turrets or generators is a waste of time. You don't want to waste certs on tank mines either, as they are wildly ineffective and can't hit magriders.

6. Don't bother with using your jump jets as a light assault; being in the air makes you a big target, and won't help you in close range combat. The light assault is best used as a long-range sniping class.

7. If you see a player wearing anything but your faction's default colors, it's safe to assume that he's an enemy.

8. Every time you hit the Q button it actually costs you infantry resources, so use it for spotting as little as possible. If you want to point out the location of an enemy to your team, the best way to do it is through the /yell command.",Satire,False,self,t5_2s48x,False,,vs,True,t3_19h3bk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/19h3bk/tips_for_newbies/,

Most dev teams (the one I work for a living on included) would rather obfuscate the issue in an attempt to save face. I'm really glad that the PS2 devs are so forthcoming on the feature and bug resolution front, it gives me a lot of faith in the future of the game, and helps me swallow the fact that I spent three times as much on PS2 as I would another FPS/MMO. :p

I love the art and beautiful landscapes of this game - it's enjoyable just to be there. If I could drive a harvesting machine and supply more resources to my outfit's 'resource bank' or if I could drive ANTs around so my faction's bases are maintained, then I **totally** would. I also wouldn't mind a little XP for the trouble, too.

And that's the thing. You might say, ""Well, why don't you just hop on a Flash and just drive around?"" The problem is that I'd like to at least help the war effort while getting a few certs in return.

If they simply gave out a small amount of XP, like repairing, for damaging aircraft, this would probably change things a lot.  This rewards keeping enemy aircraft out of your airspace which is super useful to the overall fight.  This would probably reduce the effectiveness of rocket spam by itself without any actual balance changes.

DO NOT TOUCH THE ESF MECHANICS!!!

By some miracle you have accidentally crafted a very unique, fulfilling and skillbased air combat system. 

DO NOT MUCK IT UP BY MAKING ADJUSTMENTS FOR NO REASON. Don't touch it, don't taint it.

It's fine as it is, throw in the new weapons and leave it as it is

Had a discussion with a fellow Planetside player about a new tier of cosmetic swag based on rewarding and making players more proud of their personal play styles. It's also meant to diversify the pool of cosmetic unlocks but in a relevant way. Unlocks will be rewarded by executing a certain role on the battlefield in a dedicated way. Examples are but not limited too:

* Spending 20 hours in game time in a certain vehicle and a certain number of confirmed kills (vehicle specific helmets/gear hanging of your belt/armor)
* Using explosives extensively (eye patch, scars)
* Taking the role of squad leader for 20 hours + getting 500 spawns at your beacons (beret/bad ass bionic eye)

What do you guys think? Opinions and or more ideas for roles/things to unlock welcome!

UPDATE, Addressing some points that have been made so far:

* It is very likely that the SOE development team has a very limited ability to spend time on developing things for the game that does not have a monetary benefit. I see it as totally viable that if worst comes to worst, these upgrades would have to be payed for in order to wear them. However, to me the drive to be dedicated and PTFO (play the f*cking objective) that this kind of system would add is something worth considering for the developers for added quality of gameplay value alone.
* Patches existed in Planetside 1 rewarding players for specific things, it's one solution for integrating this system in a simpler fashion, but of course physical objects and alterations are more striking, identifiable and interesting. I really like the idea of being able to identify an experienced player in a certain trait as you fight next to them in the field. Seeing your squad leader with a beret means you know those spawn beacons will be spot on, or running next to a medic with a tricked out medic backpack makes you sure he has your back if you get shot.
* This though process would also be applicable to titles, instead of a linear leveling of titles where some mid-level titles (like Maverick for pilots) are what a player really wants to use because it suits them, even if they are much higher level, titles should be earned dynamically and be class/vehicles/weapon based (like Officer Cadet, Pilot Officer, Flight lieutenant, Wing Commander for players that spend hours and do well in aircraft, Ordinance Expert for C4 and mine kills for any class or Field Surgeon for dedicated medics.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,1360942103.0,,nc,True,t3_18kv07,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/18kv07/suggestion_achievement_based_cosmetic_swag_ie_300/,

**SOE's current idea for the Implant System introduces a potential toxicity to the otherwise stellar F2P system currently set up in Planetside 2.  The current mechanics behind the system are as follows, using an example implant.**

-------------------------------------------

**Silent Running - 24 hour**

* Cost: **100 certs** or **10 sc**
* Your footsteps no longer produce noise, making you more difficult to detect.

---------------------------------------

Purchasing this implant will cost 100 certs or 10 sc (again, these numbers are purely for an example and do not represent any actual numbers set forth by SOE).  Once you have purchased the implant, you can equip it and it will then last 24 hours of real time, at the end of this time period it expires and disappears from your inventory just like an XP or Resource boost.

**SOE's intention:** SOE intends these to be a cert sink, dumping certs into what are essentially temporary potions that provide miscellaneous benefits as you'd be familiar with from any other MMO.  What this does is gives Planetside2 a means to slow cert gain by players as a whole.  

I feel like my formatting for this article is already quite weighted and subjective, so I won't go off on why I feel this is unhealthy for the game and at the very least **annoying as shit**, so feel free to discuss this, and by all means raise awareness of the subject.  I'd very much prefer not to have a character attribute RENTAL system in this game.

*(a.k.a me 10 years ago)*


##Story Time

So my the last of my outfit quit 4-5 releases ago... I've been playing solo ever since. I certed up my Scythe and Lightning and that's how I'd been playing most of the time.

Since the resource cost increase I found myself playing less and less. Just logged in to try GU12, and I only played for maybe 30 minutes before I decided to log off because I was unable to pull any more vehicles. 

The game just isn't fun anymore. I don't have ""squad mates"" to play with... pubby squads are full of kids that talk too much and (at 35) I can't really stand the annoying chatter.

*I want* to play, but if I have to wait for 30 minutes to an hour to pull another Scythe after two in a row get one shotted by bullshit like lucky Vanguard rounds or Dalton shots, it's just NOT FUN. There's no way that mechanic will ever be fun.

So I might log in and try some infantry play... but if I wanted to do that, there are so many other games with better gunplay I could play that would guarantee quick fights and evenly matched rounds.

I've been an Auraxium subscriber for some time now, but I think it might be time to consider cancelling my subscription. But, I would gladly pay $20/mo to be able to pull a vehicle whenever I wanted.

###TL;DR: 

**I'm a solo player that enjoys vehicle play, and the resource increase from GU11 has me playing less and less.**

4. Any other person on the same team

If you are higher on that list than whoever is currently using the turret, then you can kick them off. Just walk up to the turret, press the use-key, and you seamlessly take their place. (If the engineer redeploys the turret, the current user is also kicked off.)

## Why is this awesome, again?

Turrets become something you can set up in good spots, but you don't *have* to babysit them! If you need to, just go and repair/resupply something else, and your teammates can still use it while you are busy doing your engineer-specific work. If you come back, you can easily resume using it. 

*Unlike* vehicles, there's no strong reason to completely block teammates from using a turret. They can't take the turret away, they can't drive it off a cliff, there's no finite ammo to waste... So just let them use it, unless you want it back.

The nice thing about this particular system is that it's **zero-hassle**. No new UI, no fiddling with settings, no new keybinds...

&amp;nbsp;

**How mines are used 80% of the time:**

- drop them under a stationary vehicle and manually detonate them

*That should be the job of C4 and mines frankly have just took their place for all vehicles that don't have mineguard, because they do a better job than C4 explosives(do more damage, are deployed faster).*

&amp;nbsp;

**How mines should be used:**

- a tank column is going to transit through a busy road once an adjacent base caps and 3 engies with a high level of utility pouches would decimate the zerglings that aren't paying attention, softening their offense significantly

- a base has just been capped and it's an important one to hold; to add an additional layer of defense around it, tank mines are left by engineers in the area to thwart any surprise attackers

&amp;nbsp;

**What could be done to solve this issue? Four things:**

1. **New Mechanic:** Shooting a mine will not blow it up. The mine will fizz a bit and then it will **despawn when shot.**

2. **Cert change:** The second level of engineer mines should award an additional **2 mines** instead of one. Now, an engie with maxed Utility Pouch will be able to carry 6 mines (4 from mine levels, 2 from the pouch)

3. **UI change:** Friendlies should be able to see if a mine is friendly (with the little indicator) from **at least 50m**. The current distance now is about 5 meters the last time I tested. Too many friendlies are shooting down our mines because they don't want to risk.

4. **Mine Scale change:** Mines have been ""nerfed"" a few updates ago by making their size larger. Before they were too hard to notice, now they're easy to spot from 75 meters. Yesterday I blew up about 12ish mines while roaming in my tank. **We need something in between the two.**

Usually, there is one overall ops leader in teamspeak who is in charge of all the platoons. However, If he is platoon 1 leader he cannot set waypoints for or manage the squads of the other platoons.
To better the management and coordination of multiple platoons in game we should be able to form companies, battalions, and regiments.

A company should consist of  2 platoons. A battalion should hold two companies. Company leaders and above should have at least the same management and coordination abilities as platoon leaders just for more people.  For example Company 1 commander can set a company waypoint for Company 1 and be able to move anyone in his Company between squads an kick anyone from his company. He has no power over company 2. The battalion leader can manage both companies. I think higher level leaders should get more leadership abilities, but I can't think of what to give them.

Platoon, Company, and Battalion Commanders do not belong to any squads. They get their own stand alone positions and minimap symbols. They would fill a leadership bracket that is separate from the squads. So a full strength platoon would now consist of 49 people instead of 48, as it has 48 squad members + the leader. A full Battalion would have 199 people(1 Battalion Commander + 2 Company Commander + 4 Platoon Leaders + 192 squad members).

Please give characters a two hour cool down on logging on OR a two hour cooldown on an alert starting, but only for switching between characters on the same server.

What if I have multiple characters on the same server and want the XP? - The best solution I can see is to have a button on the character selection screen that harvests your daily certs.  That way you won't need to log into each character on the same server.  **ADDITIONALLY** you'll note that one of the suggestions above was for a two hour lock to begin once the alert began.  So you see the ""Alert Incoming"" message and bail, getting 15 minutes to quickly log in to your other characters and get the daily certs.

If you have two characters that you enjoy on the same server - again, if we had a 2 hour lock that started on alerts starting this wouldn't be a big deal.  If you have two characters that you switch between as one faction begins losing alert?  You're part of the problem and I hope the devs give you every opportunity to get one and only one of your characters off the server. 

So I guess to sum up the addressing concerns bit: make the 2 hour lock timer begin at the start of an alert (or when you log into one) and put a harvesting button on the character select page for daily cert gathering.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,1374588918.0,,vs,True,t3_1iv5ol,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1iv5ol/please_put_a_two_hour_timer_in_for_character/,

For example, Pressing ""V"" was the first layer, you could then select what it is you wanted to talk about.  Some options were:  I Need, I'll go, I'll defend, I'll attack, and so on and so on.  Each of those categories also had another menu so that you could select, for example, the specific location you would be attacking - ""I'm attacking their medical terminals!""

Or even better, when a person takes out a vehicle with a gunner seat  and can quickly and effortlessly say - ""I need a gunner!""

I hope you will consider my request, and I hope that the community can let their voices be heard by upvoting this if you agree with the idea.

Examples inside,DJSlambert,332,56,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/16u5t8/idea_allow_bases_to_be_upgraded_at_the_cost_of/,"WvWvW (A 3-way faction battle, much like PS2) in Guild Wars 2 had this.  You could upgrade all sorts of things.  Stronger guard NPC's,    additional turrets/artillery,   stronger walls, etc.

This would give players much more immersion, because YOU personally affected the base in a way.   

Upgrades are on a per-base basis.  They only affect the base you bought the upgrades for.

Examples:  
-500 mechanical resources would give turrets an extra 100m range  (maximum of +500m)  
-1000 infantry resources would reduce spawn times  
-2000 infantry resources would give Max's spawned there a +100m range on their AA bursters (maximum of +500)  
-A sustained 5000 aircraft resources per hour would give the base an anti-air bubble  

You could have it so individual players had to pay the full price, or allow outfits to pool their resources.

Given a large enough variety of upgrades, this would fix the metagame problem.  It would give a huge advantage to factions who can best organize their base upgrades. 

This would also bring about different strategies.  If there was an upgrade that made bases take longer to cap,  one strategy would be to start upgrading the defenses of the bases closest to your warpgate, in order to create a bubble of hard-to-cap bases.

MOST IMPORTANTLY:  If you lose a base, all of the upgrades get erased, thus giving players are reason to defend bases.

**PREFACE**

-----

[This has been crossposted to the PS2 official forums, for the sake of getting as much exposure as possible.](http://forums.station.sony.com/ps2/index.php?threads/at-it-stands-i-do-not-feel-infiltrator-cloaking-is-broken-please-take-a-moment-to-review.89773/)

Let me introduce myself.  I play on Jaeger, I have just under 200 hours of gameplay and am currently BR50.  I mostly play Light Assault and when I do play Infiltrator, I use a lot of the same tactics, positions and angles.

Infiltrator cloaking has been an issue since beta, but this most recent build has appeared to have altered this area.

I'm sure anyone who frequents the forums or this Subreddit has seen screenshots and videos circulating, showing the now ineffectiveness of the Infiltrators cloak ability.  I do not believe the issue demands the amount of concern from players that it is getting.

Before I begin, let me give you an example of what playstyle these shots are based around, because that's going to play a large role in my explanations of the shots later on.

This is an infiltrator who is up-close and in the fight.  He uses an automatic rifle, an SMG, or a semi-auto rifle.  He infiltrates the enemy base, hacks their terminals and turrets, all while killing enemies through the utilization of the following.

* Footsteps - Listening for footsteps to make a best guess about the enemy position in the structure, while maintaining a good sense of where his allies are using HUD indications and his minimap.

* Noise Discipline - Doing as little jumping and sprinting as possible, to keep his own footsteps quiet.  This also means only utilizing cloak when necessary, as it is very loud and will alert enemies.

* Trigger Discipline - Allowing himself to pass up groups of enemies in favor or picking off lone soldiers or pairs, he can't afford to be spotted and shot.

* Knowledge of the base layout - Knowing where jump pads, lifts, and good concealment is in case he is caught and requires a quick escape.  Having a plan to retreat to a safe area if he is discovered.

This is how I play my Infiltrator, and this is how I see most Infiltrators play.  Explaining the style is simple, practicing it to great effect is hard.

-----

**My Gallery**

-----

I considered posting a large album of screenshots for your viewing pleasure, but I'd actually like to take the time to explain them individually.

I am using the lowest settings on all available features, and am using nothing but the positioning of the my friend to demonstrate why cloaking really isn't that bad.  Most other people have taken screenshots in bright, open environments in order to exaggerate shortcomings as much as possible, I too have done this in order to show you how it's being done.

**I've spent roughly 3 hours now preparing these screenshots and streamlining my explanation to them, so I kindly ask that you consider taking a few minutes of your time to consider my opinion with an open mind before you join the commenting.  Thanks!**

Let's get started.

Our first shots are going to be our friendly old infiltrator standing in the middle of the room, on catwalks, and in places where he would generally be obvious at point-blank range.  I am standing roughly 5-15 meters away from him in most shots, in order to more accurately represent how far you would be from an Infiltrator that is actively avoiding you.

* http://i.imgur.com/dtivRvp.jpg - The legs are pretty obvious as they are in a bright section of the room, proper positioning, as I'll demonstrate later, could easily avoid that.

* http://i.imgur.com/KgTvcH9.jpg

* http://i.imgur.com/JdFt9yz.jpg

Excellent.  If you're looking hard for him he's going to be relatively easy to spot, but if you're just sprinting through the room, trying to get to the terminal or into a clear combat zone, I don't believe you're very likely to spot him.

Our next set is our cloaked friend taking cover in a corner.

* http://i.imgur.com/u6OXBtr.jpg - I can't even see him.

* http://i.imgur.com/2WLhzhV.jpg - His rifle makes a somewhat weird pattern if you look for it.

* http://i.imgur.com/P7VFdK1.jpg - At this range, even, he's surprising hard to spot.

* http://i.imgur.com/DxFWr4U.jpg - Hello old chap!

So at this point you may be thinking to yourself ""Wow, how come all those other shots look so clear?""

The short answer is that they took their shots in lighting conditions that heavily favor being able to see the Infiltrator.  I took my shots in lighting conditions that heavily favor *not* being able to see the Infiltrator.

Positioning clearly plays a huge role in your success as an Infiltrator!  See, I chose dark, multi-colored walls and corners, while others have chosen bright, glaring solid surfaces in which the dark silhouette of the Infiltrator will contrast.

* http://i.imgur.com/ysv0xce.jpg - A little bit like this! (UI on)

* http://i.imgur.com/zpPAnZq.jpg - Or this! (UI off for comparison)

* http://i.imgur.com/N5DKaGY.jpg - Or even something like this.

* http://i.imgur.com/RpPzzSL.jpg - Hello world!

* http://i.imgur.com/1k5fM44.jpg - Even something as simple as finding a small patch of dirt that won't contrast you can make a **huge** difference!

* http://i.imgur.com/8ZcUiro.jpg - Finding a *large* patch of dirt, on the other hand, will again render you pretty much safe again!  Fight on, my cloaked buddy, fight on.

Now contrast can work both ways.  Knowing the shade you're aiming for is important, because very dark environments can work against you as well, triggering the ""casper"" effect you've seen in multiple screenshots.

* http://i.imgur.com/NvKT8lN.jpg - What's that thing on the wall?

* http://i.imgur.com/usMYsxS.jpg - I see you!

Even in worst-case silhouette positions, a distorted backdrop can always help your cause.

* http://i.imgur.com/YB4xhWC.jpg - Something as simple as clouds and some WG sparky effects can turn your obvious shadows into what looks like dark shades in the sky.

-----

**IN CONCLUSION**

-----

Quite frankly, I don't like cloak now any more than I liked it before.  I play on low because of the huge FPS benefits, as well as cutting down on unimportant things such as flora, bloom effects and shaders.

I believe cloak should be the same across all settings, hard-coded as a specific effect that does not change, and it should look roughly like what medium setting cloak looks like now.  If this were the only effect that did such a thing, I highly doubt one could get enough Infiltrators on their screen to actually cause performance issues.

When it's all said and done, there's no reason to feel too bad about cloaking on low detail.  As long as you're choosing a decent backdrop and not doing crazy obvious stuff in front of your enemy, you're still pretty hard to see!

Thanks for reading.  I ask again that before you comment, you take a few minutes to review what I have to say with an open mind, I really hope to shed a little bit of light on this topic and get some good feedback and discussions!

Also, as much as I hate to ask, if you do downvote, **please** leave me a comment explaining why.  I've put a lot of effort into this collection and would like to see any constructive criticism or explain things that you might have concerns with!  I will gladly be reading and replying to every comment that is made.  I'd also like to ask that negative criticism not be met with storms of downvotes, I'd really like the chance to discuss all opinions without anybody being slammed into the dust.

He stands at the forefront of human progress with all the tools he needs to begin a great work; a monument to human ingenuity, kindness, and respect. He is perfectly equipped to seize the reigns of fate, to put an end to those blights which plague humanity, and to drive us all gallantly towards a brilliant future.

Instead he spends his time cheating at video games.

“But why?” you ask. “Why isn't he out researching a cure for cancer, or volunteering at a soup kitchen, or hell, just playing the game the same way someone who wasn't a spastic douchebag would?""

Well, I fear that's a complicated question, and it requires us to delve deep into a wounded, twisted psyche to answer. In order to comprehend why he does as he does, we must witness first-hand the grand tragedy of the modern age as it plays out in the microcosm of a fractured soul.

Again, picture The Planetside 2 Hacker:

Lounging deeply into his worn, grease-stained computer chair, he lets out a guttural, spittle-spraying laugh. He has just obtained yet another head shot through the aid of machine assistance. His eyes gleam with malevolent delight as he takes another long swig of his Mountain Dew. He lets the neon green liquid trickle down the sparse, coarse hair of his neck, settling in its intricate folds as he surveys the kill notification. He guffaws. It is that same BR3 that he has just killed thirteen times in a row. The emotion he is feeling now is something akin to how you or I might experience our wedding vows, or the birth of our first child, or perhaps an orgasm, though these exact feelings are things he's incapable of comprehending as they involve positive emotions towards other human beings. 

""But how?"" you ask. ""How does a heart grow so dark as this?""

It is a long and tragic tale, the details of which I can only guess; years of self-loathing and mental abuse, rejection and denial, coalescing into a blackened spirit. Some people, when faced with such horrific adversity, challenge themselves to become better; to be able to stand tall and look down upon their tormentors from a position of moral superiority. Those who are weaker become tormentors themselves; striving to re-establish a sense of control in their life by using what few advantages they do have (physical strength, wealth, specialized skills, etc) in order to take out their frustrations on those who are even less capable of retaliation than themselves. They might pour hours and hours into developing just one inconsequential ability (say, being good at a video game) simply so that they can have something to feel superior towards others about. But there is one, final category. These individuals are so pitiful that despite their burning desire to take out their frustrations on the people around them, they are actually too utterly impotent to do so. Developing any sort of basic skill is such a monumental task for them that even something so basic as moving a mouse cursor across a screen and clicking at the correct moment is beyond their grasp. You can imagine that these people must be incredibly desperate for an outlet for all their pent-up ire and self-hatred.
 
So how does the PS2 hacker attempt to impose his will upon others? He does it in what is possibly the most feeble way imaginable: He downloads a .exe. Then he proceeds to log onto a free computer game that normal individuals use as a temporary distraction from their normal lives and “beat them” at it. He does this all for imaginary points that are made completely meaningless by the very act he uses to get them and a sense of triumph over completely defenseless opponents. He  acts out an affirmation of agency over others that is so feeble it is literally more puerile than urinating on an ant hill (at least
in that case he would actually be snuffing out dozens tiny defenseless lives, as opposed to maliciously shunting electrons in mischievous directions). One can only imagine that without access to the internet his burning desire for rebellion would have to be sated with going to the local playground and pushing down toddlers, or scrawling small profanity-laden notes in easily missed locations in public restrooms. It is completely impossible for you or I to understand how utterly devoid of any sense of personal worth someone has to be that they would actually feel a sense of accomplishment at enacting a power fantasy that is so lame it makes punching a crippled person look like a respectable feat of strength. And they do this *for hours on end*.

So, for a final time, picture the Planetside 2 hacker:

He has spent a tireless eight hours doing absolutely nothing of consequence. But he has so many points to show for it, so very many points. He reasons that the others must be jealous, of all these points he has. And look at that K/D ratio. He earned that, he thinks, by being so clever as to be able to search google for cheating aides and by being so psychologically devoid of shame or any notion of the fact that rules-based reward structures cease to have meaning when the rules themselves are circumvented. But then something begins to happen; tears well up in his eyes. He has the sudden horrible realization that he is so alone, so very, very alone. Somewhere, deep down, the fact that all of this is an empty masturbatory practice, an endless cycle of gluttony to fill the massive void in his heart where any sort of pride or sense of accomplishment in his life should go, is clearly apparent to him. But he has no choice, he must continue, because he has lost all ability to reaffirm himself. His self-esteem is so tied into pointless artificial reward structures that they are all he has. He weeps for the tragedy his life has become.

After nothing but nerfs ever since launch (A lot of which were deserved), it looks like the devs have basically decided that they aren't going to try and fix the air balance at all, and instead just create a bunch of places where aircraft can't interfere.  Tanks are suffering the same fate.

I see one gigantic problem here: Nobody gives a shit that their own tanks and aircraft won't be able to participate in the fights anymore, they are just all happy that the enemy won't have any. 

That betrays the real nature of the problem with vehicles in PS2.

If I made a thread about nerfing the Sunderer I'd get downvoted to hell, because nobody looks at a Sunderer and goes ""Oh yea, I fucking hate when my enemies use Sunderers, I'd gladly not have Sunderers of my own if my enemy couldn't use them anymore"", but that's how people look at every other vehicle in the game apparently.

That's where the design of this game goes horribly wrong. People aren't happy to have tank support, or to have air support. They don't feel like they are getting anything out of having friendly vehicles on their side, they only want enemy vehicles to go away.

I'm severely disappointed that there was never a real effort made to make the relationship between friendly units strong and rewarding, rather than always just focusing on creating tools to destroy enemy units and now terrain to keep them from joining the fight.



Infantry should love their tank and air support. Vehicle weapons should be essential for taking out hardened or difficult to reach targets, and there should be a strong interplay between infantry and vehicles to take such targets down. Calling for air strikes or tank shelling should be a primary mechanic of the game. Having a vehicle help you out shouldn't mean he takes your XP away, it should mean you both get more XP than you would on your own.  That's how the game **should** work. That's what's really missing here. 
The whole reason why people don't like vehicles is because everything about them is designed to just negatively affect enemy players, and nothing about them is designed to positively interact with friendly players.

In the Meantime, spawning a MBT will probably leave you dead in 2 minutes or less, and your Smoke protection only works every so often.

I am **not** asking for a nerf for the Flash + Fury. The Flash is weak, and easily destroyed. But it makes absolutely no sense for a small one-man buggy to have both a higher survivability and higher lethality than a huge heavily armored MBT.

When people are viewing tanks as easy-XP, while shouting that the Flash is OP, something is messed up.

MBTs need a serious buff. There are simply too many counters out right now for tanks to be effective. Guided rockets and Anti-Tank snipers everywhere. In the Meantime, the flash packs higher firepower and higher speed, while simultaneously being practically immune to both.

Enemy tanks should be something you are afraid to fight. Not something you get happy from seeing.

Of course we don't want to go back to the Tank-to-Spawnroom-lockdowns we used to have. But that can be easily fixed simply by better designed bases.

* Squad numbers associated with vehicles. It is currently impossible to see via map who is where once vehicles are being used

* Turret orientation markers in vehicles (like the lightning already has). As a driver I need to know where my gunners are looking, particularly if they're calling out warnings about where things are. It *can* be done by calling directions, but it's a lot easier and more intuitive if I already know what direction they're facing relative to the direction I'm already heading (otherwise you're having to translate their compass heading to how it relates to your own compass heading).

* Squad name listings for all squads in a platoon. By all means make it possible to disable if UI complication is a worry, but why can I only see my squad at a glance rather than the members of all squads? I shouldn't have to go to an interface menu to see everyone in the platoon (particularly if I've trying to work out who a number on the map is).

* Command chat. The current implementation allows only squad leaders to partake. That is a seriously flawed design, as many outfits leave squad level command to one set of people, while others co-ordinate the larger scale activity. There either needs to be a separate squad leader chat, or anyone with command chat enabled should eb able to access it at all times.

* A simple indicator to show whether a vehicle is locked to your use or not. Many outfits and squads lock their vehicles to squad/outfit use only, but a lot of time can be wasted by others running to try and get into a vehicle they can't access. That's not good.

* Some way of assessing where everyone is. If we ever want to try and direct the zerg it is hopeless doing so without having at least some information as to where they are all distributed (although the VS zerg on Miller seems to make that somewhat easier by seemingly having a desire to button themselves up inside a base completely surrounded by enemy territory, and stay there for an hour or two while the rest of the cont is capped by the TR or NC).

* More informative objective markers on maps. For example, requesting air cav, ground support, AMS's, infantry etc.

* Ability to illustrate routes and paths on the map for squad or platoon level information. The old PS1 ability to draw on the map was tremendously useful when trying to command large platoons around. Even better would be if these could transfer to the minimap (so you draw a route on the main map and it appears ont eh minimap, negating the need to keep flitting between the two)

I think we can all see there's a truly great strategic game here burning to get out, but without tools to help us manage the game at that level all the concerns about the metagame become largely irrelevant.

Take a look at this, also read the comments: http://dk.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1dr6ko/prosieben_no_loyal_soldier_bundle_for_some/

To give you a quick summary: Pro7 Customers feel shafted, and the comments section is about discussing options to avoid your service and go for SOE. 

If you don’t entirely get what that means: The PS2 community hates you, and they want to make sure that every new potential player avoids you. In their eyes, you are the plague. And it wasnt us that made you become said plague, you managed that yourself. 
Lets take a look at the last few months:

When the deal between SOE and Pro7 was announced, players across all games were up in arms about IP blocking and the splitting of existing community’s. Thanks to the loud voices, the crisis was mostly averted, and players can play with each other, regardless of territory. They just have to use the territorial service. 

We told you to make sure to now screw up with the market place, promotions and customer support, and you guys promised us that everything will be fine and players should feel no difference between Pro7 and SOE. 

Life was good. For a moment.

Then Planetside 2 release happened, and things got bad. But okay, it was release, your first one, and release for an MMO is usually a difficult thing. Some complained, but stuff got fixed and everything was fine. Just that nothing was fine:

And these are just a few example. There are many, many more.

The really important thing they all share: There has not been a single word from you guys. RadarX from SOE jumped into the fray at some times, trying to clear things up and make people understand. But I have yet to see anyone of you folks. Its the same on Planetside Universe. There was communication in the past, but these days its rather quiet.

Anyway, that brings us to today, and the first link I posted.

Its just another complain about your service, one of many. It clearly isn’t the first one, and I bet it wont be the last. 


And that’s a problem. As said above, people hate you. If your customers hate you, then you need to do something to fix the situation. 

These are the problems:

1. Customer support: There are plenty of examples of your customer support being pointless. I'm pretty sure the community will be so kind and find them all rather quickly (do it folks. ;) ). Your entire CS staff obviously doesn’t know what their job is. Hint: Make your customers happy again. They approach you because they have a problem. They want you to fix that problem. So go, fix it, and make sure they leave you with a smile on their faces.


2. Communication: The community has a problem with you, that’s pretty clear. In order for you to fix this, you first need to fix the things that make the community angry (Login server issues. The whole Respawn promotion screwup), and then approach the community and talks with them. Don’t expect us to come to you, right now we want you to get lost. You need to approach us, ask us what we hate, and then make things better. That means you need to be on PSU and on reddit, as well as all the other places. There is no such thing as a EU community and a US community. We are just one big community, the US folks, the EU folks, the Aussies from Down under and everything in between. Don’t make the mistake and assume that there’s a split, and that you only have to take care of a bunch of players. We are one big group, and you need to be right there with us, and not stand somewhere at the side waiting for people to find you.


3. Promotions: Whenever SOE does something, you need to do it as well, exactly the same way they do it. No additional rules, nothing that could potentially screw someone over. Otherwise you end up with threads like above. Fixing the issue later by just giving people what they should have gotten in the first place isn’t helping much, that’s just damage control. The issue should never have popped up in the first place. But it did, and yet again we saw no communication from your side, until affected players approached you. 







That’s it, for now. Go and get those problems shorted out.

DO NOT blow up enemy terminals.  They are vital to taking over a base.  Infiltrators like myself can hack these terminals and allow our side to use them.  This can be crucial to gaining a foothold in an enemy base- sneak in, get a vehicle terminal hacked, spawn an AMS Sunderer, and BAM, you've got a spawn point in the base and have turned the tide of battle.

If you destroy these terminals, they cannot be used by your team until the base is captured and they are rebuilt.

Today, I actually had someone fire a rocket AT ME and the terminal I was hacking.  They felt the need to blow it up WHILE I WAS HACKING IT.  It cost us the base- we couldn't pull a Sundy and establish a spawn.

So please, please, PLEASE, for the sake of the war effort, DO NOT blow up enemy terminals except as an absolute last resort.  They will do your team much more good intact than destroyed.

...Unless you're a dirty Vanu or traitorous NC...

edit:  I literally just watched an Inf. spam sniper rounds at an enemy terminal point blank.  I know we can't all be pros on day one, but please spread the gospel.

Cert items performance metrics.,Arkanor,295,42,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/13rxkm/the_elephant_in_the_room_cert_items_performance/,"So far I've been playing this game quite a bit, and I'm still somewhat mixed on it. On the one hand we have infantry and vehicle combat that actually feels pretty good (infantry feels way more ""locked in"" than some of the earlier Battlefields) and you can get in some pretty crazy fights in the air. My problem comes down to the cert system and weapons.

Now, Cost has already been made a point elsewhere, I'm not going to touch on it here. However, with many item costs representing a significant investment of in-game time (or SC, depending) it's downright criminal to just not let us know what the upgrades do.

1. Why they decided to show 'bars' instead of numbers for weapons is frankly, *ridiculous.* FPS players aren't idiots and using such a silly metric for performance does not really supply any information. Look at the charts online available for [Battlefield 3](http://symthic.com/bf3-weapon-charts#000100000ncnnn00-00) and [Call of Duty](http://www.codblackopsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/black-ops-weapons-damage-chart.jpg). These charts are informative, they supply useful information such as damage, recoil patterns, rate of fire, damage falloff (if applicable), reload time, etc. It's certainly a lot *easier* to understand than just some simple bars. Planetside isn't the only game that does this, but let's face it. The original Planetside (as I understand) was meant to be somewhat of a thinking man's game, there's no reason players can't understand numbers, given the FPS community's insistence on finding them through experimentation.

Compare, what's actually more useful and gives you any information, [this?](http://www.blackopsii.com/bo2/weapons-list/assault-rifles/) or [this?](http://binarymessiah.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/blacklight-retribution-client_9.jpg)

Similar for vehicle mods. Oddly enough, some of them do contain a description (soldier 'suit' mods seem to all describe exactly what they do, at least advanced shield and nanoweave). I don't know how much faster the 100 cert ""racer combat chassis"" is going to make my tank. From what I hear it's only a couple km/h, but I have *no way to know*. This information needs to be made available to players so they can make an informed decision about what they want to purchase with their certs, especially considering how long it takes them to earn a meaningful amount.


Now, the only, ONLY plus I can see to doing it this way is that it would better obscure balance. Maybe players don't know *X* is the best mod but rest assured, it won't take longer than a week for them to figure it out. The internet is a relatively savvy bunch overall (when it comes to finding information at least) and that spreads quickly. Don't obscure the stats, let us know what we're buying into.

Also, while you're at it, I'd love to see Concurrent users on server/continent. It sucks logging in and running around for 45 minutes only to not see anyone because it's just a ghost town and you have no other way of knowing that.


This is really all just low hanging fruit guys, just write in the item descriptions for what your items do. It's not like we're *not* going to figure them out pretty soon anyway, and when that happens the *only* group who will be disadvantaged is new players, already overwhelmed who *don't* look everything up from external sources.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,False,,nc,True,t3_13rxkm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/13rxkm/the_elephant_in_the_room_cert_items_performance/,

Every topic I see has some declaration of ""xxxxxx is OP because it kills me a lot.""  

*That's bullshit.*

Getting killed by something a whole bunch usually means you're not approaching it correctly, or you're falling into a pattern of attack that they set up to be unfavorable to you. 

So, here are some common units that get called ""OP,"" and how/why you should be able to counter them appropriately.  These examples are for the *average* opponent.  You're not fighting the super-stars 100% of the time, and with some simple information you'll be able to kill the majority of average players when countered appropriately.

Some basics first:

*  **FLANK.**  If at first you're meeting fire approach at a different angle.  The shortest direction to your enemy is the one where the barrel is pointed at you; as long as you aren't abandoning hallowed defensive ground you should constantly be looking to get out of attacker's line of sight but keep them in *yours.*

*  Bring the proper tools.  Getting hit by ESF's?  Harassed by a lib trying to cash in that sweet sweet cert farm that is your hide?  *LEAVE.*  Yup.  leave.  And come back with the proper tool to tan his hide in return.  Grab an ESF if you're good with it, or go to an adjacent base and grab your heavy class and take a flash to get into the fight again.  If you're defending a single base against 1-2 runners and a lib firing at the spawn it's going to take them time to cap it anyway.  Use that time they're stuck there to develop an appropriate response.  This is 90% of ""lib farming,"" and it's countered by coming back with the appropriate response.

For the specifics...


*  Mag-riders.  They are highly mobile tanks that can strafe and, in limited instances *fly,*  but are hindered by an incredibly relevant flaw in that they only view forward and they tend to tunnel-vision.  A good AP lightning can easily ruin the average magrider's day by slamming into the very ass of the mag-rider and hugging them firing shells into that glowing chasm.  Heavies and tanks have a hard time hitting without flanking because of the movement, but quietly try to move to a better position and do so.  ESF rocket pods also work well.  I kill plenty of mag-riders in my drifter LA simply because the mag pilots have tunnel vision and focus mostly on aiming and randomly tapping WASD.

*  Liberators; sex pillows of the skies.  They can take a beating but the person on top usually has control.  If they're farming your spawn, leave the spawn.  If they're hammering a position, give them a tad bit of bait to stay there and give yourself an ESF, a burster max, or even a G2A heavy and re-approach.  1:1 a liberator and ESF is a *fair fight.*  You want someone, *anyone,* with a decent reaver to just start pelting them from afar and they *will* back off.  Liberators are all show; they're not OP and they're not even amazing as a unit themselves.  GREAT liberator teams are a force to be reckoned with but they can all fall to a single moderately-talented ESF.

These are just a few examples, and I'm sure more will show up.  If you want to know how to kill something, *ask.*

There is a method and counter for approaching everything, don't let your lack of understanding lead you to the road of just spouting ""that shit's *OP.*""

I'd like to see this happen for a couple reasons.

* 2 - Helmets, being separate from the armor wouldn't be affected by any future armor cosmetic updates and so far have better surface area for viability.

A Terran Republic Re-education,Theomancer,286,37,175,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1bl7z6/what_is_freedom_a_terran_republic_reeducation/,"Welcome to your re-education class, soldiers.  I know that some of you are here unwillingly, as prisoners captured on the battlefield.  With contemporary nanite technology capable of respawning each of us upon death, the Terran Republic has initiated a new program for taking some prisoners captive when possible rather than killing them.  I also know that others of you here have willingly defected from your respective factions, and are interested in hearing an alternative position on our conflicts.  I salute you.  In either case, I trust that the Terran Republic's re-education program from the Ministry of Information will be remedial for your thinking.


The first session in the course of study is on a proper understanding of “freedom.”  The New Conglomerate fashions itself as a bastion of freedom.  They purport to offer true liberty from oppressive forces and coercion.  While the Terran Republic is disparaged as a tyrannical and authoritarian force, the NC suggests that they alone can assure absolute autonomy and self-agency.


But what is “freedom”?  As the New Conglomerate would have it, freedom is taken as an utter absence of restrictions.  It is radical independence, without restraint from any external forces or influence. You can do “whatever you want, whenever you want.”  Someone is “free” insofar as there are no obstacles or barriers preventing them from doing whatsoever they choose.


Now, let me draw your attention to **Exhibit A**: this goldfish bowl on the table.  Observe what happens to the fish when I “free it” from its external restraints, of having to be bound to water.


*Look at it.*  See how the fish flips and struggles, fighting for motion and direction.  The gills stretch and quiver for the refreshment of oxygen.  Note how its muscles convulse, as the fish battles against its slow and agonizing suffocation.


Before long, we see that it lies on the table—lifeless.


So I ask you again, soldiers: What is “freedom”?  Is this what freedom looks like?  When the fish is “freed” from the constraints of inhabiting the water, its *true* freedom to move around and even breathe the breath of life itself is destroyed.  The fish is not more free, it is *less free*, if it cannot honor the reality of its ordered *nature.*


The same is true of us.  If humanity is to survive, we must honor the reality of our nature.  (This is why we reject the heresy of the Vanu Sovereignty, with their trans-humanist attempts to distort and disrupt our nature.)  Freedom is not found in the *absence* of restrictions, as the New Conglomerate suggests, but instead in finding the *right* restrictions that are conducive to human flourishing and the broader common good of the human race.


This is why we are the *Terran* Republic: we fight for the good of the Terran race—of all humanity.  Freedom is not an end unto itself, but a means to an end.  And true freedom cannot be found by naively rejecting any and all forms of constraint, but instead finding the right constraints that are rightly-ordered.  It is through law that we find true freedom.  It is through order that we are given real opportunity.  It is [through unity that we have true liberty.](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/)",,False,self,t5_2s48x,False,,tr,True,t3_1bl7z6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1bl7z6/what_is_freedom_a_terran_republic_reeducation/,

If you already own 4/7 of the items in the bundle, the bundle is still *full price*.

I feel like I'm being punished by SOE for paying full price for items. If anything I should be considered a valuable customer. I've spent a lot of money on this game. While that should not get me favoritism, it does mean I'm more likely to run into bundles where I already own half of the stuff.

I had a chat with a customer service rep, and they really wouldn't do anything and didn't really say anything would be done about this problem.

It's a very poor customer experience, and I'd really like it fixed.

**EDIT: grammars**

**EDIT 2: Clarification**

I'm not saying the prices are too damn high. I'm saying that if I've already bought something in a bundle, don't make me pay for it twice to get the rest of the bundle.

Suppose the following Bundle

- Gun 1
- Gun 2
- Camo A
- Vehicle Weapon I
- Helmet X

... all for 2000SC at 42% off.

But I already own:

- Gun 1
- Vehicle Weapon I

What I want to do is buy Gun2, Camo A and Helmet X for 42% of their original price.

... but currently I can't do this. If I get the bundle, I pay for all of the items and get NOTHING in return for the money I spent buying the items I already have.

It's to the point where, when prime time alerts come, not a single group of friendlies on the map are a mindless zerg but are instead all part of an intelligent, goal-directed effort. Even random VS who aren't participating in Command chat are generally sticking themselves to the sides of major outfit platoon movements.

It seriously feels like real 600-person armies fighting each other in grand campaigns.

1365499551.0,241,self.Planetside,1bzar8,"Helios VS: ""What the hell are all these TR liberators doing here!?"" ""That's our air support.""",AJWinky,275,34,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1bzar8/helios_vs_what_the_hell_are_all_these_tr/,"I am totally ashamed I don't have a picture of this, maybe someone else might. What I do have, though, is a fantastic-ass story.

First, some background: The Helios server had once held the distinction of being the only PS2 server on which Indar had never been captured. No matter how hard any of the factions tried, they could never quite make it, and as a result the prestige of the coveted Indar capture grew to immense proportions. All the outfits on the server had fantasies of being the outfit responsible for the final cap, and, in secret, negotions between outfits and even between factions led to fragile alliances bent on bringing their own faction closer to that sweet, sweet cap. I can’t tell you how many times a primetime wave of brilliant strategic manuevers led ultimately to disappointment as our hearts lit up at the tantalizing possibility of finally reaching the full capture only for the rising tide of our faction’s territory to go out once again. Recently, on the eve of GU6, that conquest ended in disappointment. Everyone has felt the growing population of the NC, and on Helios the separation in faction populations had grown wide. In the early morning hours when VS and TR outfits were still asleep in their beds or waking up and heading to work their day jobs, NC capped Indar with a 70% population advantage. There was no glory in this victory. They moved in during the dark of night and snuffed out the meager resistence that the other factions could muster compared to their overwhelming numbers. There are even reports, unconfirmed, that hackers were involved. Whether this was true or not matters little. Even without hacking this was a battle without honor; an unworthy end to the legacy of Helios.

For days the NC Indar cap bonus hung over our heads. It was our badge of shame. That is, until tonight.

At 10:00 PM on this Monday night an alert started on Esamir. We were outmanned as ever, plagued with a superior force of NC. VAST (Vanu Advanced Science and Tactics) and a few other outfits (forgive me if I fail to mention you, and let me know so I can add you) decided they weren’t going to play the NC’s game; they were going to take this opportunity to wipe clean the slate of Indar. I only wish I hadn’t been so skeptical of them at the time. VAST knew that if we ever wanted to restore the Vanu’s honor we’d have to work while the other factions were distracted. But they didn’t pull off their coup when the other factions were sleeping, no, they began pulling the continent right out from under their noses. While all the NC and TR platoons were occupied on Esamir the VS spread across Indar unopposed. It wasn’t until we were long into the alert that I realized exactly *how much* territory VAST had managed to capture. Only a few specks of red and blue territory dotted the map around the warpgates. It was at this point that I made the hard decision to pull our DPSO (Dropping Purple Smoke) platoon out of Esamir. The men were torn, but ultimately glory means more to us than certification points. We would free Indar.

The last few territories on the map were, by far, the hardest. By this point outfits in the NC and EXE (Execution) in the TR had caught on to what we were doing and began staging grand defenses. It didn’t take us long to give up on our hope of capturing the entire continent to instead turn our attention purely on the NC. If we couldn’t have the VS banner flying over Indar, we could at least remove the wretched banner of the NC. We pulled all of our main forces out of the TR territory, and began an assault on Arc Bioengineering, the final territory of the NC. 

It did not go as planned. We were driven out, and at our lowest point the NC had recaptured Ceres Biotech, Ceres Farms, and Highlands Substation with squads and platoons sitting at each. Some of VAST’s people began giving up hope and returning to Esamir, and with a heavy heart I began ordering my troops to do the same.

Then Leopardwood Nursery fell to the TR. 

I looked across the map. The TR had not moved to retake their major facilities at all. They hadn’t even captured a single territory towards their North; they had simply bee-lined it to the NC warpgate. EXE were driven with only one burning passion: finish the NC, whatever the cost.

I ordered my troops back to Indar. VAST recaptured Ceres Farms, and then Ceres Biotech after it. For one brilliant, glorious moment Vanu and Terran fought side-by-side to oust the NC from Highlands Substation. Of course, shortly thereafter we broke out into killing eachother, but once discipline was re-established within our ranks we ceased any attack on the TR and turned our whole attention to the final push: we had to take Arc Bioengineering. VAST held the line at Ceres Biotech as wave after wave of vanguards poured out of the NC warpgate. DPSO led the final charge into Arc Bioengineering. 

It was hell. Reavers swarmed the sky. Vanguards and lightnings perched on the high ridge overlooking our only narrow avenue of advancement rained fire down on our approach. No vehicle could possibly survive: it was to be a slow crawl for our infantry all the way across the embattled dirt road and the heavily fortified bridge, all the while yellow tracers zipped past our bodies from every angle and explosions rocked our every step. We gradually pushed forward, taking the road from the NC yard by yard, inching up our sunderers whenever we could, medics reviving the fallen who scattered the battlefield. When we finally made it across the bridge to the cap room waves upon waves of NC soldiers poured out of their spawn at us, and the battle became a scramble to revive just enough of the fallen after every new assault to repel the next.

Suddenly things grew dire. Our sunderers were all destroyed. Our spawn beacons were all gone. Our medics began to dwindle. VAST reported that without reinforcements Ceres Biotech was surely soon to fall. Our capture progress stopped, and all of our hard work was seconds from being completely undone.

Then the sky turned red.

“What the hell are all these TR liberators doing here!?”

“That’s our air support.”

Eight or more TR liberators soared over Arc Bioengineering unleashing fire from the heavens down onto the swarms of NC infantry pouring out of their spawn room. Capitalizing on this brief reprieve our medics revived as many of our forces as they could and we squeaked out the last few percentage points of the cap bar.

Now, as you’re reading this, after I go to sleep, the NC zerg may come back again in the dark of night and steal Indar unjustly once again. But at this moment the Indar cap bonus lies unclaimed. The shame of Helios has been redeemed.

1354728494.0,234,self.Planetside,14bxeq,Sovrinn's Guide to Becoming the Greatest Combat Medic on the Continent,Sovrin,287,53,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/14bxeq/sovrinns_guide_to_becoming_the_greatest_combat/,"Here are some great tips that will turn you into a total bad-ass. 

1. The first thing you have to do is change your attitude about your support role as a medic. You are not healing and reviving allies. You are harvesting experience from the dead and dying. *You are taking advantage of human corpses.* You have much more in common with nineteenth-century body snatchers than the lovey-dovey doctors you see on TV. When your friends ask you to come with them to help kill more people, you don't say, ""Just wait, I gotta revive this guy first."" Instead, you say this: ""Just wait, I gotta harvest some delicious experience first."" While some may be dismayed by the hordes of big, dumb idiots who rush out into both enemy and ally fire, you become happy, excited, and potentially, sexually aroused. 

2.  Never bother reviving an ally combat medic. There's no sense in increasing the competition. The only thing other medics are good for is stealing your well-deserved experience. What kind of monster would deny you your God-given right? The kind that deserves to be dead. 

3.  Revive first, ask questions later. As a medic, you'll find that your allies sure are in a hurry to increase the number of deaths that show up on their scores. While one may find the desire for a high-death count unusual, who are we to judge? After all, we're only in it for the experience. We thrive on the stupidity of others. Because your allies will always accept your revives no matter how many enemies are nearby, don't waste any time checking to see if it's safe for someone to be revived! (Unless, of course, you're only motivated by self-interest.) In the time spent checking, some other asshole medic could harvest the corpse of precious experience first. We wouldn't want that, would we??

4.  C4 is the answer to all your problems. As far as I'm concerned, the only legitimate reason to stop harvesting experience is to blow shit up with C4. You should try to get it with your certs as soon as possible, because its uses far exceeds that of simply killing enemy vehicles. Ally sunderer's in a bad position? C4 them. Ally vehicle ran you over? C4 them. Some idiot TK'd you? C4 them. An ally looked at you the wrong way? C4 them. Right all wrongs with C4. C4 everything, casualties be damned.

5.  Are injured allies wasting your valuable time by running across the map as you chase them down with your medical applicator? Shoot the person in the back to get their attention, then harvest them once they've stopped. If the individual is especially annoying, kill them by shooting them in the back. Then plant C4 beside their body. Once you revive them and they accept, detonate the C4 to kill them again. If you have no more C4, shoot them. Feel free to repeat this process again and again until they stop accepting your revives. We have to teach them somehow.

6. I've saved the best advice for last. The greatest way to become a bad-ass medic is to steal revives from other medics. This is totally what you do. Once an ally combat medic has finished reviving someone (indicated by the dead person sitting up), and the medic's applicator is no longer on the dead person, you quickly swoop in and start reviving the dead guy. It's important to keep your applicator on the dead guy for a bit longer after the revive indicator disappears, because the dead guy's being revived will not be indicated by him or her sitting up (they're already sitting up once you get to them). Once the dead guy accepts the revive, you will get the experience and the other medic will not. The ability to quickly steal revives is the only reason to put points into your medical applicator! Note: If an ally medic ever does this to you, kill them immediately. Scum-bags who do this to *you* do not deserve to live. You're only allowed to do it because you're awesome.

So, if you follow these tips well, you'll become an insufferable cunt (erm, great medic) in no time! Stay classy, San Diego.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,1354731479.0,,tr,True,t3_14bxeq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/14bxeq/sovrinns_guide_to_becoming_the_greatest_combat/,

That means a bunch of content that will be in the final game is not in the game now. They are not testing the game as a whole, but certain aspects like the client and server. Hence the **technical** test part.

The game isn't done, and **a lot can change in a few months**. The game could be unstable as hell now, but launch in November and be perfectly stable. Fixing bugs is generally a fast process. Don't go complaining all over the place about how some animation is broken, or the game crashes if x, y and z happens. Submit a bug report.

That brings me to my second point. **Submit bug reports**. The game will almost certainly have an ingame bug reporter where you pick a category, enter a description and click submit. Don't say to yourself ""Oh, somebody else submitted that, I don't want to submit it again"". SOE probably has interns or something grouping related bug reports. **The more bug reports they get for an issue, the more important it becomes**. This isn't always true, for example, a CTD in rare circumstances is a higher priority than a broken animation that affects everyone.

With bug reports, please be as detailed as possible. SOE already has some detail when you submit a bug, like system specs. **Include the information that is required to reproduce a bug**. Step by step instructions. If somebody can follow your directions precisely and recreate the bug, it gets flagged as reproducible and is easier to fix and test the fix. If you have some extra time, recreate the bug more than once so you can be sure of the cause. This isn't always possible though.

----

Please remember, be patient with SOE. Developers are the worst at testing. They make too many assumptions, because they built the system. They don't bother to make sure you can switch guns while jumping, because they assume it would work. You're job is to be like a regular player and do all the weird ass things that developers wouldn't think of doing.

Good luck and I'll see you in beta!

Even capturing a major facility yields a paltry 1k xp, which is roughly eight kills worth of xp. I suppose it varies between classes and vehicles but if you are jumping into combat, eight kills is about fifteen minutes of gameplay even when things are going poorly. Capping a major facility usually takes several hours if it is contested.

I think this could be contributing to the ""bio dome syndrome"" where folks are content running repeatedly into the meat grinder at choke points instead of going for objectives, because the former is by far the fastest way to unlock new stuff.

Edit: mageganker also raises the really good point that vehicle XP bonuses are pretty pathetic as well. It takes a lot of time and effort and a specialized build to take down aircraft or armored ground vehicles, but the bonuses don't really reflect that, especially when you consider how easy it is to get infantry kills.

In the first instance, EMP, flash and concussion grenades are exceptionally bad in terms of [counter-play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRBcjsOt0_g). But at least one user is getting fun out of their existence.

In terms of game design the unknown and unknowable risk a user is entering into when dropping one of these grenades removes the fun from *both* players. They stop being fun to use (as anyone who runs into a conc'd room and gets immediately killed by someone with this implant will be able to attest after the patch) and they were never fun to be used on.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,1374076980.0,,vs,True,t3_1ihb0y,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1ihb0y/the_emp_flash_conc_protection_implant_is_a_game/,

**The Good:**

* Thank you SOE for incentivising players to jump continents for this event. Ameresh is a fantastic continent and it was amazing to have such a large scale battle on it.
* Some of the details for the new stuff that is going to be implemented, roadmap e.c.t
* Another awesome thing was seeing Levelcap lead the vanu, he proved his competency in the event

**The Bad:**

* The stream was terrible, constant audio drops and laggy stream. This needs to improve if SOE wants to make this an E-Sport. (The sound even cut out as vs was doing their victory speech)
* More engaging commentary, the commentators were not able to analyse the battles, tactics being used. Get some guys who are able to comment on the BATTLE not just throw around the trash talk.
* If you set an event ADVERTISE THE SPECIFIC DETAILS PROPERLY, seriously i didn't know that the event was cross-server until 20-30 min before it was starting. 

""If this facility is in your Empire's hands on the most servers at the end of this 30-minute challenge, triumph will be yours."" 

 -Yeah we are all familar with **this** facility

* Reset maps before events are held on them or state clearly that this is not going to happen so outfits can prepare before the battle

* If you care about the European community participating in cross-server battles then perhaps advertise the times for Europeans.

* Sit down and think why was the Vanu victory was so widespread? It does not matter what faction you play realize that if one faction dominates a battle like this there are some fundamental issues with balancing.

* Give people a reason to care about these battles, example if you participated you get a medal and if your faction won while participating you get a medal, i don't need it but if all the non outfit members bounce as soon as they see they are losing then its a zerg game.

* Most facilities owned isn't different from most territories owned when you get down to it these are the same thing (different challenges). 

So what do you guys think about the event, id like to hear your feedback?

*Edit: Had to go to bed shortly after posting this (im over in the U.K) thank you for all the people putting up feedback and responses, will try and get around to responding.*

1357875108.0,232,self.Planetside,16cwf4,Sunderers aren't there just for AMS,Ivarr_Ironfist,273,41,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/16cwf4/sunderers_arent_there_just_for_ams/,"People only seem to use Sunderers for AMS. AMS is good but there are often 10,000 Sunderer drivers floating around that could fulfill that role. So, what else can Sunderers do?

ADVANTAGES OF ATTACK SUNDERERS (AI &amp; AV)

- Although the damage is probably not as good as an AP heavy tank attack Sunderers have at least 50% more HP (more with blockade armour). A Bulldog does ~20% damage to the back of a heavy tank and you can get 5 hits off quickly.

- Sunderers don't have weak rear armour like a tank.

- They're much taller than tanks and are therefore better cover for repairing Engineers. The large HP of Sunderers means it's much easier for teams of Engineers to keep them up.
- You can use them to provide good mobile cover for infantry.
- They're more manoeuvrable than tanks.
- **You can spawn them at any vehicle terminal**. If you have advancing tanks near a small facility you can have the Sunderer there instantly. They're the only single thing you can spawn at a small base that is a threat to a (reasonably) good tank driver 1v1.
- **An attack Sunderer can go through shields with a gate shield diffuser.** They are the only ground vehicle that can provide good anti-vehicle and anti-infantry while that anti-vehicle shields are still up.
- **MAX units can get inside**. There is a reason tanks can't hold MAX units, it would allow them to always have AA. If at least one person in the Sunderer is an AA MAX the group is well balanced to take on any type of threat.
- **They can carry nine additional people to assist in the attack**. Drop nine Heavies and or AV MAX units in the middle of a group of tanks and the tank drivers will shit themselves.
- You can be a back-up AMS and an attack Sunderer. Having an AMS doesn't prevent you from having effective weapons or equipping blockade armour/mine guard. If the primary AMS is destroyed you can take over.
- If you're carrying AMS you can deploy (in a convenient spot) to allow any member of your group to respawn on you instantly. (Assuming he tells you when his deploy timer is at 0).
- Bulldogs are kick ass anti-infantry weapons. Arguably the best ground AI weapons in the game. They might not one hit people like HE, however, they have a reasonable re-fire time and six rounds in their magazine(base that is). There is much less downtime reloading in comparison to HE, hence, less time for a cunning infantry person to do naughty things to you.
- ESFs can't take you out in a single flight of rocket pods.
- If you're carrying ammunition or repair instead of armour you can be constantly re-supplying or repairing friendly tanks. You make it fr3ddy the uber t0nk driver happy!
- The driver is 100% independent of either the weapons, therefore, the Sunderer maintains the ability to do 100% damage while moving to flank someone. Tanks can't do this.

GENERAL TRANSPORT SUNDERERS

- The safest way to get infantry from A to B with maximum mine guard. One Engineer can't drop enough mines to take out a Sunderer with maximum mine guard. 

MINE FIELD CLEARER

- See last bullet point. Clear mine fields easily and without losing any resources. Bulldogs are also an effective tool for disposing of mines. Flashes are also good for this, however, this involves losing vehicles and infantry dying.

VEHICLE REPAIRER

- The proximity repair system allows you to repair all vehicles near the Sunderer. Why is the better than an Engineer? Doesn't have heat. Repairs all nearby vehicles, not just one at a time. Tank driver can't run you over. Can't be killed by accurate enemy infantry.

SHIELD FERRY

- Ferry people through the enemy shields before they are down. Allows you to take from a direction the enemy might not necessarily be expecting. Allows you to take out key tactical assets such as enemy Sunderers in Tech Plants and the vehicle terminals in the bottom of a Bio Lab.
- You can park your GSD Sunderer half in and half of the shield, allowing unfettered access to the base through a doorway that probably isn't well guarded. As long as the enemy doesn't blow your Sunderer up that is...

FRONT LINE TRANSPORT

- When the defence is good, it is often difficult to get an AMS close without it being blown up very quickly. Sunderers can be used to quickly and safely transport people from the AMS to the front line.

If you've actually read all of my post (in which congratz, that's dedication!) you've probably noticed that I have mentioned Bulldogs at multiple times. M40 Fury is technically the anti-armour weapon, however, it's inaccurate and does less damage than a Bulldog per shot. The M40 does fire faster than the Bulldog and might pull ahead slightly in TTK time against armour but the difference seem to be small at best. The Bulldog, on the other hand, is much more effective against infantry.  I'd rather take the weapon that is more accurate and highly effective against infantry rather than the one that is slightly better against armour. This is just what I have noticed though, I don't actually know what the TTK times are like.

The M20 Basilisk is a bit of a jack of all trades weapon. It's okay at everything but not the master of anything. It needs a better re-fire time to be effective at anti-infantry and more damage to be effective at anti-armour. The anti-air is much better covered by an AA MAX, so lets not even go there. The one thing it is best at is taking armour out at a range. You can use it like an M12 Kobalt as well if you don't want to completely compromise your ability to kill vehicles.

The M12 Kobalt is the high calibre anti-infantry machine gun. Two advantages it has over the Bulldog are less reload down-time and accuracy at long range. If you're engaging a constant stream of infantry or engaging infantry at range then the M12 might be preferable to to the Bulldog. It's also not a bad weapon for fending off ESFs (like the M20), but AA MAX units are just better. What you give up for this anti-infantry goodness is the ability to damage armour. You won't be able to damage any vehicle bar a flash or ESF.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,False,,ns,True,t3_16cwf4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/16cwf4/sunderers_arent_there_just_for_ams/,

Combine this with multiple engineers repairing base elements, I actually get lower EXP overall, because I have the same number of assets to repair, and less EXP per item.

1354088174.0,228,self.Planetside,13xa2a,So Higby answered a ton of our questions about future features for Planetside 2 in a stream today,BeefNoodles123,252,24,432,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/13xa2a/so_higby_answered_a_ton_of_our_questions_about/,"So Higby answered a ton of our questions about future features for Planetside 2 in a stream today…

Here are the answers as best as I can remember (not word for word what he said):

1) Will exp be continent based instead of server? Probably going to change it to be continent based.

2) Will resources gained go back to being global? No.

3) What classes need the most love and have the most features coming? All of them, but especially the Light Assault and close second the MAX.

4) Sticky grenades for Light Assault? Probably not. We are thinking of designing the Light Assault to be more of a lone wolf player/1v1 assassin. We are thinking of making them have ammo scavenging tools. Like gaining ammo after each kill.

5) Will the Light Assault get recon tools like real light infantry? We've thought about that a lot, but right now, all the new recon tools are going to go to the infiltrator, like spotting for artillery (he might be referring to orbital strike).

6) Will Maxes be able to spec to be tankier but lower DPS? Probably, or other interesting customization options.

7) Will the other factions' tanks be brought down to match the prowler's weak level? No. We are going to buff the prowler.

8) What faction's guns are the weakest? NC, by a considerable amount (there was a chance he was being sarcastic).

9) Will there be camo bundles so we can just buy one camo and apply it to everything? In the future, yes.

10) Will the mission system allow for specific missions like ""overload this generator."" Yes. It will have broad and specific mission capabilities. There will be rewards for completing missions, but not necessarily cert rewards.

11) Will mission system objectives have distance and direction markers on the screen to guide new players? Higby didn't actually answer this one, but someone else in the room (not affiliated with SOE) laughed it off saying it is a noobie idea and a clone of Halo UI. Higby didn't respond.

12) Will Auraxium be coming back? Maybe. Or maybe something similar. There will be big changes coming to resources in the future. No ETA.

13) Will other classes besides HA and MAXes be able to deal with vehicles? Yes. We will add tools so that more classes can deal with vehicles.

14) Will infantry be able to deal with liberators? Yes. Right now only air can kill liberators effectively. We want to add tools to allow infantry to stay infantry and still be able to combat libs.

**From Higby:**
**I want to clarify #14 because I think it missed the point of what I was trying to say.**

**We want ground to have effective deterrence for aircraft, and especially so for enemy   fighters, but we don't want ground to necessarily be THE hard counter to any aircraft. Our goal is to make it so that ground can feel like they can ward off enemy aircraft and be extremely dangerous to risk taking pilots. However, maintaining air superiority is still going to be the most effective and fool proof way to be safe from flying threats. Therefore we want ground based AA to be effective vs. strafing fighters and high flying bombers alike, but not necessarily the best way to counter those threats. The best counter for Liberators should be friendly fighters.**

15) Will there be larger group units than the platoon? Yes. No ETA.

16) Will commanders be able to draw on the map?  That feature was built into the game, but not ready.

Thanks a bunch Higby!

We were slowly advancing toward the NC warpgate, over the huge iced river. As many of you know, that's where the most amazing tank battles happen. I quickly tell my squad to load up into our battle sunderers, and we get out in the open.

Click, click, click. Dead. Engineer turret from 500 meters away. The only way to survive them was to spawn speed upgraded lightnings and not let go of the W button.

The NC push forward with one of the biggest tank zergs I've seen. Vanguards everywhere. Me and my squad whip out our engineer turrets (4 people had it certed) on Jaeger's crossing's hoverpad. We take out about 14 tanks, and the zerg dissolves.

So instead of having an epic tank battle over a frozen river, we just took turns insta-gibbing each other's tanks from 500 meters away, with one of the cheapest weapons ever. Kind of ruined the fun.

Engineer turrets suck because:

- No warning to the insane damage it does. Just a horrible clicking noise

- Very low tracer. Won't really matter, because they're usually so far out you can't land a shot on them

- Bullet speed is extremely fast. Compare it with the HA rocket.

- Fast reload time

- Infinite ammo. INFINITE AMMO.

- Insane damage: 4 shots to kill a sunderer. You can turn a tide of a battle with two engineer turrets with two shots from each guy

- Camera guided. Unless you're tearing it up at 85kmph over steady ground that doesn't slow you down, you're going to get hit. Also, this removes the bullet drop that makes it so hard for the heavy to land rockets at long range.

- Extremely long range. The range is almost as good as the lancer, except it does 8 times more damage than the lancer.'

&gt; But but but, infantry don't have other options to fight against tanks!

Yes they do. That's what Heavies are for.

&gt; You can just snipe them off their turret, they're stationary targets!!1one

To snipe a guy off an engineer turret, you need to flank him to his side. And that's just not possible to do if he's really far away. The hitbox of the turret is too big.

&gt; You can destroy the turret with a rocket launcher u know

Yeah, if you can get the drop right on a tankshell or a rocket, you can take it out. That's if you find where he is. Then he'll just use his spawn beacon if he dies, and if he doesn't die, he'll just pull out another engineer turret.

**TL;DR**
Engineer turrets are a bit overpowered. They started ruining entire tank battles, something a lot of us really like about the game.

I've been a daily reader of this subreddit for 6 months or so now, though rarely post. I pretty much reactivated my account so that I could post about this troubling topic which may be implemented sometime in January.

For those of you that do not know, ""Short period of invulnerability will be added to freshly spawned / revived players - breaks upon game actions such as entering a vehicle or using a weapon"". Meaning anyone who is revived, drop pod, or spawned at a sunderer will now get a one or two second immunity.

Why is this bad? The main two points are 'choice' and 'cheese'.

Choice
Giving an invulnerability removes much thought going in to accepting revives. The ability to choose between where you should or should not drop pod or spawn, becomes far less strategic because the imminent threats are not nearly as frightening. 
-If you die out in the open and there is a full out war going on, if you decide to accept a revive, you should fully expect the possibility that you will be shot to shit and instantly die again. That is why there is a yes and no button. You should not have the guarenteed chance to make a run for cover as 10+ people shoot the crap out of you, or worse - revive the person who revived you.
-If you are about to drop pod in to a hot spot, you should be looking at the details of the map, including what proportion of the hex is friendly vs enemy, as well as how far along the capture is. If you see that the hex(with one base in it) is almost entirely enemy, with the capture bar mostly complete - and you decide to hot pocket in to that shit, then you deserve to die, instantly.

Totalbiscuit rants about it in his January patch overview video. I realize that just because TB says something, doesn't make it law - but I do completely agree with every point made, and with the few Reddit posts I make, I feel I could use some help.

http://youtu.be/ugkKP1WttgM?t=9m51s

Cheese
It should be noted that spawn and revive invulnerability has been done in games before such as Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Darkfall. In every case, it has led to cheese. There are so many cheese tactics which will open up. At max rank, a medic has a 2 second revive. As is, I can already often get off total cheese revives.

Here is a clip from Bad Company which really... really shows just how stupid it can get, and how invulnerability has no place in an FPS.

WATCH ME
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA6ZWCEYDQ0

I read this subreddit a LOT, and in the time this game has been out and much before it - I really have not seen any requests for spawn invulnerability. I cannot imagine who has been asking for this. My guess is people who do not actively think before accepting revives, or before spawning in to a war zone. However, in the time this announcement has been made, there have been DOUZENS of posts across all forums and platforms, pleading to not have it implemented. Lets not dumb down this game any more. 

With all of this said, it should be noted that there is already an invulnerability and it is more than enough. Any player who has ever attacked an enemy AMS sunderer(everyone), has seen enemy troops spawn from the vehicle. If you are watching the sunderer and see someone appear, they are actually immune to damage RIGHT then. It is only after they sort of 'move' slightly, and sometimes even 'drop' to the ground, that they can be killed. This is because whilst they are in a loading screen, they have invulnerability. Try it. Watch a sunderer, someone spawns, shoot the hell out of them, nothing happens. After about one or two seconds, they will animate slightly, and that is when they can be killed.

The same can be applied to drop pods which drop in hot spots. I play in an ESF a lot, and can often see them falling from the sky. If you were to shoot at the drop pod right as it lands, you will do no damage. You actually have to wait a second or two(spamming Q is best), until an enemy troop appears. They can then be harvested.

To sum up my rant, I am asking for us to please hold on to invulnerability. It is mostly a defensive tool, and with new spawn buildings with protected balconies as well as a whole new tunnel system being implemented to amp stations and tech facilities - lets hold on with this change.

I never played the original planetside so I don't quite know how they were implemented there but I just wanted to show you guys how I think mechs could add a fun new option for players without disrupting the balance of the game. 


My basic idea for mechs would be a lightweight 1 person vehicle capable of dishing out decent damage but being fairly easy to take down themselves. This would make them more suitable for smaller fights and skirmishes as they would quickly be taken down in a larger battle.


The armour setup would be slightly different to tanks and other vehicles with front, sides and top all taking 100% of damage and rear hits only taking 150% of damage which would be counted as the rear of the cockpit rather than the legs. (as apposed to the 240% tanks receive to the rear) this would make flanking them less worthwhile and give them more survivability in close range engagements. Possible weapons would include HE cannons, heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, AV cannons and flamethrowers. An example of a weapon might be an AV specialized cannon which would deal approximatley 1000 damage per shot (aproximatley 60% of a MBT's equivalent) so even with two of these equipped you would only be able to achieve around 120% of the damage output.


Here is my idea for the Vanu Mech:

http://imageshack.us/a/img32/5521/vsmech.jpg
It would be the lightest mech of the 3 with roughly 4200 HP. MBT's all have 8000 and Lightnings have 6000 so compared to the tanks it's very weak in a straight up fight taking approximately 3 shots from most AV weapons to kill. It's defining feature between the other two mechs is it's locked frame meaning it operates similar to normal infantry or the magrider where it is always forward facing but has the capability to strafe. It would also have the quickest backwards moving speed and quickest turning but a top forward speed of around 40mph (the tanks are between 50 and 60). 


It's weapons would follow Vanu tradition being accurate with decent damage and little drop. There would also be the option to cert a dash ability allowing it to quickly reposition in fights. 


Here is the Terran Republics:

http://imageshack.us/a/img208/4985/trmech.jpg
This would be slightly tougher with around 4600 HP, not much more but meaning the shots to kill from some AV weapons would be 4. It would operate slightly differently with a swiveling top half allowing you to travel in one direction while facing another up to 90 degrees to each side. With the rear armour counting as rear of the cockpit this would mean the direction you face would always be the front armour unlike tanks. This mech would have by far the highest forward speed of around 50mph allowing it to match some of the slower tanks. It would also have fairly quick turning but slow backwards move speed. 


They would be capable of dealing the most damage with the highest rates of fire or reload speeds but probably more medium to short ranged focused weapons. It's unique ability would be a charge allowing it to increase it's top speed for a short while but sacrifing its turning substantially, letting it quickly close the gap on it's target or burst out of a dangerous situation.


And Finally the NC's Mech:

http://imageshack.us/a/img543/6092/ncmech.jpg
In comparison to the others this would be much more of a tank with up to 6000 HP making it level with a lightning. It would operate similar to the terrans with the separated cockpit and legs but the cockpit would probably turn bit slower to give the feeling of weight. It would also be the slowest mover to balance out it's tankiness with a top speed of around 35mph and relatively slower turning ect. They would therefore be more suited to a bruiser role being more comfortable standing toe to toe with other vehicles in the game. 


In keeping with the NC's style their weapons would be hard hitting with a slightly lower sustained damage output than the TR mech but more usability over longer ranges. It would also be able to cert into a deploy mode that would reduce incoming damage increasing it's ability to duke it out in 1 on 1's even more.


Now that you've seen my ideas feel free to let me know what you think. I believe something like this would add a lot more diversity and interest to the game giving a vehicle which is both fun to use but not overly frustrating to play against. Due to their mostly squishy nature they would not allow for a single person to roam around and dominate and they would require a decent amount of teamwork in order to take on tougher targets or larger forces. 


I hope you enjoyed the ideas and pictures, sorry for the huge post but I felt it was necessary in order to properly explain the idea. Thanks for reading.


TL;DR MECHS ARE AWESOME!!!!




**[EDIT]** Hi guys, having read a lot of the feedback I just want to address some of the main issues raised. 


Firstly there is the issue of people still referring back to the BFR's from planetside 1. While i appreciate your concern that it was presumably extremely poorly balanced I do not feel that there is anything inherently overpowered about a mech-like vehicle.


Just because a mech in one game was overpowered doesn't mean a completely differently designed mech will be overpowered in another game that is a huge over assumption with no logical grounding. While i understand the thinking that it is a mech so it must be the same as the old mechs I would hope you at some point get the chance to read the post fully. I've done my best to keep balance in mind as much as possible and genuinely do not think they would be 1 man owning machines like a lot of people seem to fear.


And secondly the issue of what role they fill in the game. I like to think for the majority of the time they would be used for a light vehicle support in areas that the tanks simply cant reach such as certain rough terrain and in tighter areas such as around buildings and within the larger bases.


They have the potential to use cover much more effectively than tanks due to their height and general mobility. While not as fast as tanks they are more maneuverable which lets them peak in and out better and just generally makes them much stronger in shorter range fights than the somewhat cumbersome tanks.


Out on the open field is where they would be weaker but still not useless. Since they are effectively glass cannons you cannot afford to be caught alone but when a few work together they would become a much greater threat due to their high damage potential. I think this would allow for some more interesting inter vehicle play than the current system of just buy as many tanks and hurl them at the enemy. For example you could have an ally buy a well armored sunderer and drive it right out in front of the enemies line drawing all their fire then have a couple of you in mechs emerge from cover to burst down your distracted targets.


I think this sort of high risk reward vehicle would add a variety of gameplay and teamplay that is different enough to tanks, which are currently a very safe thing to engage with even when on your own.


Also they would be incredibly fun to use, which I think is hugely important. This is a game it's suppose to be fun I think some people genuinely forget that and take things far too seriously. I agree that there are plenty of other vehicles that could add even greater depth and tactical opportunities, believe me I have a huge list and mechs are not necessarily a top priority. But I'm not sure there's anything that could be quite as fun and engaging and for that reason alone they would be worth adding at some point down the line.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,1360871987.0,,,True,t3_18ie47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/18ie47/mechs_in_planetside_2_fan_art/,

Jax is a great guy, but he's pretty obviously biased towards his outfit, which frequently participates in MLG matches.

Totally unprofessional and really frustrating to watch when you're not a fan of his group.


Goldenboy also should be replaced.  Anyone who is involved in the game can see/hear that he doesn't know the game anywhere as well as he should to be casting the events.  He frequently miscalls weapons, vehicle units, classes, strats, and territories.

**The problem SOE wanted to solve.** The best, most logical, and most fair solution to the double purchase issue would have been refunding Station Cash. However, given that there were apparently barriers to being able to do so, and SOE rightly still wanted to provide some compensation to the affected players, they wanted to find an alternative. Today the compensation was distributed. The issue most people have is not that compensation was given, instead, it's the form and degree. These are the biggest issues with the handling of it:

**1) The ""sanctity"" of the certification point.** Excuse the hyperbole, but the reality is certs have a special value in a game like this that is attempting to avoid the ""pay to win"" pitfall of many free to play games. Certs have a higher value than station cash -- certifications bring you straight upgrades, whereas station cash for the most part brings sidegrades. Separating station cash and certs such that certs needed to be earned by successes in playing the game has been a key in avoiding this pitfall. Today, while it is true you cannot technically buy certs with station cash, there was without too much stretch some harm to this ""sanctity"". Many people who bought items with station cash received large cert bonuses as a result. These large cert bonuses are then used on the battle field with clear advantage over other players. The issue here though may not be just that some certs were given away, but the shear amount, which brings up the next point. After all, station cash *can* be used to buy bonuses to increase your cert gain rate, but the clear difference here lies in both the magnitude and the sense that the recipient players did not ""earn"" them via actual gameplay.

**2) The magnitude.** By reports, people have received tens of thousands of certifications across each of their characters. The value of certification points cannot be understated, and there is a considerable amount of time and effort that goes into earning so many certs. If people were receiving 1000-2000 certs max (which is still quite a sizable bonus), it'd be a different story. But, as an example, there are level 1 alts now with 20,000 certs -- that's the equivalent of what BR63 players have acquired during their entire characters' lifetimes. There are some players who received far more, and to be fair, it's likely that the majority who received cert credits received less than this. The point is though, the shear magnitude of what players received seems like it was not well thought through. Remember, cert points carry significant value. There's a reason why all the items I've bought I've used SC for rather than cert points. *[note: according to Higby, the rate of credit was 2000 certs per extra 1000 spent. The example given was spending 1000 SC on two different characters would result in 2000 certs for each character. If this is true and not a typo, I can't understand this mathematically. In effect they've not only refunded the original cost of the weapon if treating SC/certs 1:1, which as I've argued is a huge stretch, but they've given a 100% bonus on top of it making it 2:1]*

**3) The bugs/randomness.** There appears to be a sizable number of people who received thousands of credits for free despite seemingly not even appropriately qualifying. These are the people who have only one character, some who have never even purchased station cash, etc. A few may try to argue that this shouldn't be a big deal and instead people should just grow up, but sadly, that's psychology for you. It works this way in all areas of life. Anytime other people gain something that seems to be unearned or unfairly obtained, if we ourselves did not gain that benefit and instead need to earn it through our own legitimate efforts, it's discouraging and tends to devalue our own accomplishments (our ""accomplishments"" here being the effort required to earn all of our certification points).

With all that said, I of course still really enjoy the game, and I personally hold a lot of respect for how SOE has handled the game's development and their commitment to relations and responsiveness with the community (ex: some super nice changes coming our way via the test server). I've spent a fair amount of money on the game and will continue to do so as I feel it's worth it. I just can't help but feel like this could have been handled a lot better. A simple modification changing the number of certs refunded per station cash purchase to a smaller fraction would have been quite fair and still well received (people who bought 2 of the same item didn't go into that transaction expecting anything in the future -- *any* compensation would have been a bonus and nice gesture). Unfortunately it may be too late to do anything, but if for nothing else, SOE should approach anything dealing with certification points with far more caution in the future, especially giveaways that are tied to station cash transactions.

Please remember lots of people report lots of other people for any number of things - we have to check every single one - and, we do not just take the word of one over another.

&gt;If the person you reported hasn't been banned in moments since you reported them it could be for a plethora of reasons some of which are:

&gt;We're looking into someone else right now.

&gt;We need to monitor some things, and they aren't online. We'll get to them once they are again.

&gt;They just aren't cheating.

&gt;It may take us an hour, a day, a week etc, but we will investigate every single report thoroughly. It may not be as quickly as you'd like, but we afford the same thorough checks to be certain to every account. If you were reported you'd want us to afford the same to you and your account.
&gt;Thank you!

Make of it what you will; I'll still be recording hackers if possible and using this as evidence when submitting support tickets, since those always get a response from a CSR.

Edit: Oh and can you upvote this for a little visibility? I made it a self post so it should be ok to say that I think.

Comparably - empty warpgates/regions have gone from 100+ FPS to around 60 and  medium/large fights are down from 40 to 12-18. 

I have deleted UserOptions.ini and tried every possible combination of settings post patch to get my FPS back to a stable rate but nothing is working.

Any ideas on what might be the cause? On my end nothing has changed at all, the hotfix that solved some people's problems made no difference to me at all.

Edit: I've also been crashing frequently. Other than the good old flickering screen 'til 1 fps bug that caused crashes it hasn't ever happened. In 8/9 hours I've crashed 4 times seemingly at random.

1369587517.0,216,self.Planetside,1f36m3,FNO: Let's actually spotlight outfits.,TriumphOfMan,265,49,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1f36m3/fno_lets_actually_spotlight_outfits/,"So I heard this Friday that a new NC outfit alliance was announced on FNO. ""Fuck yeah,"" I thought. I was looking forward to seeing more organised opponents in action. Viewing the vod instead what I got was:

* No information on the outfits at all. 90% of the talk was breezeshooting about random crap.

* A cameraman who consistently got lost and refused to use the observer mode for the first 20 minutes or so.

Luperza and the rest of the FNO crew I'm calling you out here. Let's make FNO better, let's make the **Oufit Spotlight** actually **spotlight the outfits.** Pretend I'm Joe Casual who thinks outfits are for schmuckers or doesn't even know what an outfit is. Help me understand how *fucking awesome* it is to play in an outfit. Get me interested, get me fired up, *get me to join the NCSC.*  

**Right so what are we looking at fixing here?**

**1.** First and foremost: Luperza, you are the DJ, the maestro, the conductor. You **need** to control the show and control the flow. Your cameraman sniffing glue? Help him. Give him a push to where he needs to go. I appreciate they're often new but letting him flounder about at the **wrong base your outfits aren't even fighting at** needs to stop. At least stop it from happening multiple times in the one evening. Yes it's cool to watch the TR shoot up shit but you're spotlighting NC. These people who often wait **months and months to get this spotlight** (yeah, TEST, I know how many times you got rescheduled on). Follow them, help them show off their moves. Don't waste this moment for them.

Secondly, on the same point of DJing the show, control the conversation. Talking about SCUs, lattice changes, personal opinions from people we don't really know? Drop it. Save it for after the spotlight during a player panel or something. The spotlight is for the outfit, what they do, how they operate. Yes, talk to them, but don't ask them about off topic frivolities and PS1 nostalgia or at least keep it to a bare minimum.

You're the reporter for the viewers. Ask them hard hitting questions and get the facts for us.

**Examples of pointless questions that were asked last night:**

""What is your favourite thing about Planetside? And what is your most hated?"" *Who cares? This is a soft and irrelevant question. Morbo disapproves and will destroy you.*

""What do you think we could do to change the resource system?"" *Irrelevant! Save it for a forum post or after the spotlight. Do a panel if you must.*

""blah blah blah, outfit decals, blah blah blah."" *Do you really need to talk about T-Ray teasing with outfit decals during this? Is there really no other time for it?*  


**Stuff you should be asking:**

""How are you attacking this base? ... Why does this work?""

""What's going wrong here? ... How are you going to stabilise the situation?""

""What are the most important points to hold in this base? What are the keys to your defense?""

""How are you squads currently equipped? Why have you chosen these loadouts?""

""Do you have any vehicle support? How are they supporting you?""

""Are you watching for a particular counterattack?""


See a theme? Engage these outfits to talk about what they're doing and why they're doing it. **Spotlight them.** We're taught in school about the 5 W's and H when writing or talking about an event. When where what why and how, use 'em. Show Joe Casual why he wants to buddy up with them. Advertise what he can get out of playing with a group instead of single player heroing it.  


**2.** Cameraman competency is a major issue. **Unless you're actively engaging and following directions as a squad member, stop playing. FILM.** Get out of the infantry mode and into the observer mode. We don't want or really need to watch your cameraman get spawncamped and die embarrassingly 15 times in a row. **Show the outfit fighting, not the death screen over and over and over.** Again this is the *outfit spotlight* not Mr. Cameraman's MLG-yolo-swag60-noscope spotlight.

Make sure your cameraman is following his platoon members, I assume that's why you had him join the platoon in the first place. So he can locate and find them easily. Don't let his ADHD take over, keep him on track.


____________________

These issues have been irritating me with FNO for a long time but it's finally reached a tipping point. I was genuinely looking forward to watching my opponents on my server have this big alliance reveal. Instead what I wound up watching was often the wrong base, wrong outfits, or a death screen. On top of that there was little to no actual meaningful discussion on any of the outfits featured.

In fact, if taking control of a facility was your main objective (instead of having fun and getting XP) the best strategy when a large force is coming would be to leave and let them cap it as fast as possible then come back a few minutes later once the attackers moved on.

Now, what if the longer you kept a facility the better reward you got? Or crazier, what if capping a facility didn't give you much of a reward, but holding it for a decent amount of time did?

1365708845.0,215,self.Planetside,1c5l5x,*UPDATE* On yesterdays cert grants,brorkanin,253,38,313,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1c5l5x/update_on_yesterdays_cert_grants/,"Update on [THIS](http://forums.station.sony.com/ps2/index.php?threads/some-notes-on-todays-cert-grants.114869/) thread

Edit: Update 4/11/12 - 12pm PDT: 

&gt; Quick update on this. We've seen a lot of people under the impression that somehow the cert grant was broken or given to ""random players"", and not players who spent Station Cash on repeat purchases. So far, after about 12 hours of investigating, and pouring through virtually every character on the list we've found zero characters who were granted certs that didn't make the appropriate StationCash purchases to warrant those cert grants based on the above grant logic. Yes, that includes all of these characters with 20-100k certs granted. A lot of confusion has come from players who purchased bundles which contained items that had previously or were subsequently purchased on other characters on their account - these were flagged as repeat purchases and treated as such. If you think you do know of someone who did receive certs without purchasing any duplicated items, we are really interested in knowing more, and you can email me directly (mhigby@soe.sony.com) with that information and we will look into it. We are still compiling a list of players who did not receive cert points for certain duplicated purchases.

&gt; We've definitely heard the frustration from players who were not part of this grant, and looking at some of the astronomical numbers of cert points that certain accounts received it's understandable why. As a note, less than 5% of our player population was granted certs from this and less than 0.03% of players received anything more than 2000 certs from the grants.

&gt; As a note, we don't want ""granted"" certs to be part of the leaderboards, so in a future update those certs will be removed so that only ""earned"" certs are being displayed to ensure that the leaderboards more accurately reflect level of effort of the player.

&gt; I realize this update isn't going to make those of you who are upset about this cert grant less upset, but it's information we felt was worth sharing so people could have a better understanding of what is actually happening, amid a lot of misinformation being spread around.

&gt; I want to emphasize that our goal on this grant, as with all decisions made on this project, is to provide the best possible overall experience for our players. Moving beyond this incident, we will be reevaluating our policies for future compensations to ensure we have methods that do not cause the kind of impact to our player community that this admittedly has.

&gt; Finally, to those of you who feel betrayed or hurt by this incident, we humbly apologize.

- Indar Bay Point

- Regent Rock Garrison
- Arroyo Torre Station
- Feldspar Canyon Base
- Tawrich Tower

Lets not mention Esamir or Amerish.

- Please tell me why we can't have 3 landing pads on Indar Bay Point instead of 4?
- How about we build Arroy Torre Station and Feldspar Canyon Base into the cliffside?
- Can we double the length and width of Hvar Watchtower and add a capture point?
- What if we made the bottom of Regent Rock more circular/roundish?
- Can we add a 5th floor to Crimson Bluff?
- Anything to making the fight experience differ from one tower to the next?

The only one that is argumentatively unique is Rashnu watchtower - and I love that one, the way it is actually built into the terrain, with turrets actually facing the at the road. Why on earch does Hvar Watchtower have a turret facing into oblivion? This concept can be applied to biolabs, amp stations (We are seeing some variation with these), and tech plants. Let's move the cap point in Tawrich, double the size of the vehicle bay of Eisa, Lets have dead trees in the Mani Biolab, etc, etc, etc. 

**EDIT:** Some people point out that even tho bases like Regent Rock and Crossroads share the same tower, they offer different gameplay elements. This is true - that is, until you get into the tower.

The moment where you do something you didn't think you could do, reaching a high point in your game experience that you never forget.

Tonight was that moment.

On Jaeger, NC taking large amounts of ground on Indar at any time other than the middle of the night is largely unheard of. The Indar zergs that do happen stall at The Crown or some plant or lab, then get beat back by the TR. Tonight, the zerg rolled on Jaeger, and took most of the hexes. The Vanu and TR had 15-20% population each and were fighting over the hexes on the far corners of the map, and next to their warpgates.

My friends and I, rolling around in a Sunderer, split off from the zerg to zip over to the NS Salvage Yard, while the main body took the northwest part of the continent. Joined by two other folks, we rolled up, cleared out the TR opposition waiting for us and set up camp. NS Salvage Yard is a hard nut to crack, isolated behind the TR warpgate, right next to an un-assaultable warpgate tower and only 30 seconds from the warpgate by tank.

And we held.

And we held some more.

For over 20 minutes, against engineers healing the tower cannons, Prowlers rolling down the hill, spawn beacons, Sunderer pushes, and rocket podding Mosquitos, we held fast the best we could. Eight stubborn bastards with nothing but our MAX spawns, rocket launchers, medics ressing, engineers repairing, and an unwillingness to give it up. Our unpredictable zerg was pushing the corners of the map, and the Vanu warpgate, but we only had quick glances at the map while respawning as fast as we could to get back in the fight. We had no idea how long it would take.

Finally, a coordinated push with tower cannons, a Sunderer, Prowlers, and Mossies all at once overwhelmed us. We zerged the point, fighting back in a losing battle.  Trying our damnedest to keep that base until the last second. A lone friendly Liberator came from nowhere and bought us time before getting shot down. The bar shifted, and we lost the base. Picked off one by one, we all cursed out loud at our defeat.

But it was two seconds too late.

With a window of just two seconds, the zerg captured the last hex on the map. NC took Indar. We all opened our maps and stared in disbelief at the blue box saying we had a 10% resource discount. Across the continent the zerg groups had no idea what eight stubborn bastards had done.

Thanks to the SOE dev team for making an amazing game regardless of the bugs. Thanks to the NC that hopped from Amerish to Indar to try taking another continent. And thanks to the seven other bastards and Liberator crew who held the line.

Easy, make killing vehicles just as rewarding.",Kache_,259,49,227,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/19yvjc/how_to_solve_the_infantry_farming_vehicle_problem/,"We've all been there, haven't we? We walk out of the spawn, getting pumped up to get into a nice infantry fire fight, but suddenly, HE and rocketpod explosions make us evaporate from existance. That's right. I'm talking about the infantry farmers, who sit comfortably in their tanks and cockpits who click on the glowing green EXP pinatas.

SOE has done, and will do a lot of things to try to fix this problem. Nerfing the splash radius of the explosions, for example. But I think they're missing the core of the problem. 

The reason so many people sit in their infantry farming loadout is simply because it gets them the highest amount of EXP and certs. Certs are horrendously hard to get in this game, so who would blame them? Why would they jump into their anti air ESF loadout and take out enemy liberators, be a help to their team, when all you get is a measly 100xp for a liberator kill assist every time they bail, when you can get 100xp per kill on the ground infantry, who are way more plentiful, and easier to kill? Make destroying vehicles just as rewarding, and more people will be *hunting down the infantry farmers*. That's the most important part. You know what the best part about this is? No one will whine, since no one will realize what this actually does. It makes it harder for people to farm infantry since more people will hop into AA, and Anti Vehicle loadouts.

TL;DR: Make destroying vehicles just as rewarding as infantry farmers, and the infantry farming problem will solve itself (They'll get blown up to hell)

1352754712.0,209,self.Planetside,132zla,Anyone else think the new weapon prices are absurd?,eduardobeattie,243,34,321,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/132zla/anyone_else_think_the_new_weapon_prices_are_absurd/,"So here is my rant. How many kills should be required to gain different upgrades to the game? Considering that, on average, I might get 125 xp for each kill, how about 60 (average) for each attachment, and for weapons, anything from 150 to 750.

So, lets do the maths:

60 x 125 = 7,500 xp;
150 x 125 = 18,750 xp;
750 x 125 = 93,750 xp;

This, in current cert point prices, turns out to be about...

7,500 / 500 = 15 certs;
18,750 / 500 = roughly 38 certs;
93,750 / 500 = roughly 188 certs;

So, attachments are well priced, but weapons, it seems, are now just blatantly absurd to achieve, considering some cost about 700 certs. Lets analyse this:

700 certs x 500 xp = 350,000 xp to get an expensive weapon. This, in kills, is about 2,800.

My point is, before this new patch, weapons were overall very well priced, with prices ranging from 12,000 xp (96 kills) for a slight variant of the default weapons, such as a new assault rifle, to 120,000 xp (960 kills) for a game-changing shotgun. Now, weapons cost about 4 times that. Grinding for an expensive weapon was already a big deal, and took a great deal of time, but with this upgrade, I doubt anyone will ever have the willpower of completing such a thing.

Does anyone else think that prices were quite balanced pre-patch, but now are just exaggerated? Some prices have been doubled, along with the xp requirement for certs. Do you think these prices are just ridiculous, and makes this game pay for win?

Edit: To all of you in the comments who agree, upvote the post to draw more attention!

Update: I see all of you who posted that SOE has a reason to increase the prices, and I agree. Nevertheless, to quote Omnifarious:

Friendly tank mines are impossible to distinguish from enemy tank mines until you get within a few meters of the mine.

Therefore just about everyone will simply shoot the mines on sight rather than slowly rolling up next to the mine to see if the IFF mine indicator pops up.

Can you please enable the indicator at a greater distance, or just not render the mine at all for friendlies?

**Edit:** If one of the Devs could PM me the office address. And the state it's in and what not. I'll look to see what bakeries are available.  
**Edit2:** I got the address of the office. I am going to call the bakeries on monday(It's Sunday now). And get an estimate on what we'll need. I'll then open up a Paypal or something.  
**EDIT3:** Here is a Paypal Account for you to donate money to send them Cupcakes.(**We reached our goal, any additional donations will be sent to a charity or additional cupcakes**)
I got a quote from this CUpcake place: http://www.cupcake-love.com/cupcakes.php  
That we'll need around $400 dollars for 200 people(Luperza's estimate). FOr normal Sized Cupcakes.  
It will probably not be there on release day. Since transfering the funds to my bank account takes a few days. And this Cupcake place doesn't accept PayPal. They also will deliver this for us, so no one needs to spend the Gas.  
Let's do this!  
**Edit5:** If you donated, say how much! I'll credit everyone in another bit thread and a video on my channel!  
Update Edit section on money pool:  
Currently we have $423.31  
**Edit6:** .**WE HAVE REACHED 400! Any extra cash will be either spent on additional Cupcakes or sent to a charity.** I will be taking off the donation link when the funds have been transferred.  
You guys are fucking awesome. And devs, I am preparing the funds to order your cupcakes now!  
**Edit7:** Paypal is sending the funds to my bank account. As stated before will take 3-4 business days., perhaps earlier if time goes by fast. As soon as I get word it's in the bank. I will immediately order the cupcakes.  
During this period. I'd like to explain my plan on the cupcakes design and such. They will be Faction colored, each faction color of the 200 will have Peanut butter, cinnamon, and chocolate flavors.  I cannot afford symbol designs on the cupcakes, as it would bring the price up a lot. But, if there is anything I can do to make it more Planetside like. Then I am totally going to try my best.  
Once again, good job guys. Gonna order the cupcakes as soon as the money arrives in the bank(Remember, they don't take PayPal.)

I see alot of people freaking and losing their shit over ""false bans"" on players who are getting banned and then unbanned.

These people aren't hackers, correct. What they are doing is stat padding and the punishment has been essentially a warning and a slap on the wrist with a suspension and not a permanent ban.

I'm going to bring up Delrith here as it's a pretty good example:

&gt; He got (temp) banned not because game logs showed him cheating, but because he was lit up with 127 reports from lame gamers.

Wrong.

&gt; Why is SOE banning based on reports and not game log facts???

They are.

The CSRs don't ban people based on the number of reports they get from the /report function. What it does is set up a big red flag. More red flags that show up the more urgent the person is requiring their observation. They then go and observe these people and look for dodgy behaviour.

Why was Delrith suspended specifically?

**Stat padding.**

[Let's have a look at some stats.](http://www.planetside-universe.com/character.php?stats=DVSDelrith)

He has roughly 1/3rd of his kills from VS players and roughly 2/3rds from TR. Of all the soft classes most of them show a fairly 1/3 to 2/3 ratio for VS and TR respectively.

**Except for the Medic.**

Not only is there a huge, a huge spike in *TR Medic kills* the more telling evidence is that the percentage is completely off. Very much indicates stat padding using medics on buddy accounts.

Now people seem to be freaking out thinking there's some automated ban system that works off suspicious stats. There isn't. It's all manual right now. What happened to Delrith isn't that he had some weird stat ping him, or 100+ simultaneous reports auto ban him. What happened most likely is someone noticed him stat padding, hit the /report, a CSR checked it out saw something breaking TOS and hit the banhammer.

Please read these posts by Moonlite, and remember them next time you want to report a hacker, or an important exploit.

Reposting here in case anyone missed it on the forums and because there's been a lot of posts about hacking here recently. 

Let's clean this place up.

Edit: full text for those unable to see the forums for whatever reason:

We are extremely active behind the scenes 24/7/365 on those breaking the rules. We take it very seriously. Please can I ask you though not to /report these folks, but rather to send in a ticket with their name and a good description of what's up to the CS team.

To do this from inside the game do the following:-

Press Escape

Click Support at bottom left of screen

Then Ask for Help

After the browser loads in the dead center of the screen it has an 
""Open a Support Ticket"" link.

Then you will be required to log in.

Select Category as In-game Issues - Community Standards (If you do 
not select this your ticket may be delayed)

Please make the subject Suspected Rule Breaker or something as obvious

Please make sure you include as much detail as possible in the Incident section

Character Name is YOUR character name not the person you're reporting.

Make sure to press Continue or Submit and if you have done it successfully you will be given a reference number.

You will always get a response to your ticket this way. Doing a /report you will not.


From outside of game go to:-

http://help.station.sony.com/app/answers/list/p/5833

Middle tab says Open a Support Ticket

Then you will be required to log in.

Select Category as In-game Issues - Community Standards (If you do 
not select this your ticket may be delayed)

Please make the subject Suspected Rule Breaker or something as obvious

Please make sure you include as much detail as possible in the Incident section

Character Name is YOUR character name not the person you're reporting.

Make sure to press Continue or Submit and if you have done it successfully you will be given a reference number.

You will always get a response to your ticket this way. Doing a /report you will not.


We will never tell you the outcome of an investigation because we do not disclose action taken on an account with anyone but the account owner, so be aware of that, but I will assure you every ticket you send in will be investigated.

I hope that helps to clarify some points, but let me know if I can answer anything else!
Moonlite 

Another post a ways down:

&gt;sure, but if i may ask, does /report go through different channels? are tickets higher priority? or is it just that tickets get replies? 

All 3 kinda.

/report doesn't bonk anyone over the head to say Oh a report just came in.

Tickets are higher priority. What reports are traditionally used for is when someone calls you a name that makes you cry you /report nastyperson which captures what they said in a state that cannot be altered by you or them and sends it to us. You then follow up in a ticket and say to us, ""Hey, that nastyperson called me a name that made me cry, but fear not Mrs. (Yes, there are female GM's) GM, I did a /report to back up my claim!"" The GM reads your ticket, pulls the /report nods her head while smiling at your profficiency and then smacks around nastyperson with a trout.

Only tickets give you a peace of mind knowing we are looking into your issue as we let you know we are, and we don't with /reports.

Let me know if that's not clear :)
P.S. I hope you have a sense of humour!

And the worst thing is that its true-you get much more exp for killing. During a large siege i get 70+ headshots as a sniper-more than 10k exp and i can get almost the same amount as an eng supporting allies. While killing a gen gives you puny 200 xp and taking over the base -1k. Isn't this game supposed to be about doing objectives, not random massacre?  So here are my ideas:

**1. After compromising gen, mark an area on the minimap around it -all kills(either a killer OR the killed should be inside this area so snipers/aircraft/tanks can do it too) /heals/repairs/etc there count as objective actions and give you bonus xp. If its successfully destroyed, everyone gets even bigger xp bonus for each action he commited there(up to doubled xp in sum). When generator is destroyed, defenders get the same mission untill it is repaired.**

*This way even if those 'pwners' want only to kill, they will be forced to kill near objectives to get more exp (the bonus should be significant compared to normal kills). The same system could be applied to capture points.*

**2. Increase flat capture bonus for all sizes of bases, aswell as give additional bonus for all obj actions during the whole siege.** 

*1k exp is just a joke. Increasing it to 2-2.5k xp should motivate ppl to focus more on actually capturing it instead of random killing. And additional bonus exp for all obj. actions done during the WHOLE siege would make a good reward difference between those who were actually fighting and those who just got there in the last seconds before cap.*

**3. Make a bigger passive xp bonus for defenders.**

*They dont get flat xp for sucessfull defence, and the bonus they have now is nothing.*

**4. To compensate all the xp gain increase just reduce basic kill xp.**",,False,self,t5_2s48x,False,,vs,True,t3_143v6x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/143v6x/the_xp_gain_for_objectives_requires_major_increase/,

You can use them to communicate with your Liberator Gunner/Pilot in a platoon without using Proximity/Squad/Platoon chat, as a Music channel without annoying everyone around you, etc.

To join a custom voice channel:  
/voice join &lt;channel&gt; [password]  
Password is optional.

Example:  
/voice join MorfildurNoPassword  
/voice join MorfildurWithPassword 12345  

To use the voice chat, press Numpad 6 (default).

There is also a ""/voice leave"" command though i'm unsure wether it works or not. The Num6 key still appears to work after that.

Eventhough it's a PSA, any more details on how it works - e.g. how long channels stay - would be appreciated as this system doesn't appear to be documented very well.


Credit goes to [NeonTrigger](http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/17j25p/suggestion_another_chat_mode_vehicle_chat/c86479i) who mentioned the /voice command and made me check it out in detail.

UPDATE1:  
I did some more testing. Apparently you can't leave the channel nor join another channel and you will be stuck in that custom channel until you relog, so keep that in mind when flying Liberators with different gunners.

UPDATE2:  
Custom Voice Channels DO NOT work cross faction. Sorry, spies.

Is it so that we always are within render distance of ground targets?

I don't consider myself an especially great pilot (read: I'm terrible,) but I can't help but wish for some kind of solace, while airborne. Instead of constantly living in fear of G2A devils that won't render for us.


**--Two main problems as I perceive them.--**

A2A combat doesn't exist because of how easily ground-based anti-air methods can touch airborne combatants.

Ground targets don't render for far-and-away air units, so we tend to fly low-ish to the ground so that we can fight back, playing hide-and-seek with enemies behind hills and the like.


**--How to correct these issues.--**

Raise the air ceiling.

(No, we're not going to talk about render distance, because we know how difficult that is to implement properly.)


**--What this will do.--**

Aircraft will be able to find a ""safe spot"" high above the clouds, away from ground-based lock-ons, and have a much easier time avoiding flak, due to the range.

Air-to-air combat will ensue, as ESF will be the only reasonable/reliable method of handling enemy galaxies/liberators/ESF.

Ground to Air methods will act more as a deterrent to aircraft, than the invisible wall they are now. As I understand it, that was their original intention.

Does not reduce the deadliness of G2A (no direct nerfing,) but instead encourages even inexperienced pilots to keep to the clouds if they want to survive. Instead of playing a guessing game as to what/who is trying to kill us, and figuring out which hill we need to hide behind to LoS them.

ESF will not be any more effective, as ground targets still won't be rendering. Meaning that the high-ceiling will be reserved for air to air combat, and transportation.


**--Downsides.--**
Galaxy drops immediately become more powerful. Even with a dedicated ""airforce"", we all know how annoyingly difficult it is to stave off a swarm of angry MAX-toting Galaxies.

-The current Auraxium system promotes AFK resource gain, empire jumping and massively rewards an over-populated empire. 

-Taking a facility seems less meaningful since the Auraxium is passively rewarded. A player directly involved in a base capture is rewarded the same as a player sitting in the warpgate (500xp is meaningless in the grand scheme).



**Solution:**

-Reward Auraxium for *any* area capture or defence. 

**The amount of Auraxium rewarded is based on a number of multipliers:**

-The number of facilities your empire currently owns.

-The amount of total xp earned during the fight for your empire (while tickets are collecting).

-The amount of xp that you earned during the fight.
 
-The population of your empire (to encourage underpopulated empires).




**Desired Effects:**

-AFKing issue is now moot. 

-Point capture and defence become a major focal point (instead of simply farming kills).

-Players are drawn towards larger fights instead of seeking ""easy"" captures, forming more predictable battle lines. 

-Under-populated empires can now be rewarded for their efforts. 

-Base captures remain extremely important. 




As we've learned before, Planetside 1 got a lot of things right. Passive Auraxium gain simply isn't working and its time to give it up. You could spend a month developing a complex system to detect AFK macro players or spend that time developing a more meaningful gameplay experience.

Similarly, it sucks if you're driving around 2nd seat in a tank and the main gunner gets a kill while you're fighting off another enemy. 

Sharing the full xp across everyone driving/gunning a vehicle would encourage more people to work together while manning vehicles and reduce the number of vehicles driving around with less than full occupancy.

SOE knows about it and they'll buff/nerf in the future. Right now there are bigger problems with server stability, rendering, culling, hackers, etc etc. Game balance is coming it's just not quite as big a priority right this instant.

------------------------------------

So lately I've noticed several large [FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUCK TANKS! threads](http://forums.station.sony.com/ps2/index.php?threads/tank-spam-seriously-spam-ps2-is-tankside2.62179/) pop up.

**Here's some advice:**

Firstly let's make sure you're using the right gear to fight them:

**Default dumbfire rocket:** 1700 damage vs Tanks. You should be using this, it's flat out the best right now.

**Lock on Anti ground rocket:** 1500 damage vs Tanks. Right now the lock on distance is so small it's not worth getting. If next week's buff puts it up to 300m or greater this will be great if you're volleying shots 8+ at a time.

**Lock on Anti air rocket:** 1270 damage vs Tanks. Don't use this, it's an anti air rocket. If you've been running this and complaining about Tanks being too tough to kill you're an idiot. Get your Dumbfire out.


* Next let's identify exactly how these tanks are screwing with you. Tanks don't take bases and they don't win fights by themselves. Ever see a gigantic Magrider or Vanguard column? They're the merely harbingers of an *AMS Sunderer*. **That's going to fuck you. The Sunderer.** The tanks are going to try and use their attrition value to beat you back and create space for AMS sunderers to be safely deployed. This game is about logistics, spawn points are king. The goal of the tanks is to allow their team to place a spawn point closer to an objective than the other team can. AMS sunderers have a faster respawn cooldown than base spawns by about 3-5 seconds. An enemy AMS will allow more troops to pile out on a position than a base spawn can handle. We'll come back to this point later.


* Are they shelling your spawn room and camping you in there? Again that's the spawn point game. If a spawn room is locked down then it's effectively removed as an option. You need to break out. Let's look at some options:


[Instant Action out](http://www.twitch.tv/buzzcutpsycho/c/1765563). Ever since the spawn beacons were nerfed (unwarranted in my opinion but a discussion for another time) this allows you to perform a similar strike. It can be a bit iffy, but if you're actually involved in a big battle chances are you'll get that instant action icon. This is a great way to bust out as it allows you completely surround individual tanks on all sides. Tanks hate getting surrounded like that as you can start slamming their rear and side armours quickly before they know what's going on. Every tank lost like this is a huge blow to the attack. Even if they have resources and the cooldown is off it takes time to draw a new tank to the frontlines.


[Airstrikes](http://www.twitch.tv/buzzcutpsycho/c/1753692). Having a group of people falling back to pull an airstrike is also extremely effective. Don't worry about enemy flak, the move is a piece trader. You pull out a whole bunch of ESFs and trade them for Tanks and Sunderers. If you remove enough enemy armour you can use the breathing room you created to finish off the attack on foot. Don't be afraid to sacrifice a base if you need to. It's quite possible to sacrifice a position, respawn at the next and bait the enemy armour to committing again before raining Hellfire death on them. Again once the enemy armour is destroyed you can launch a rapid counter attack and reclaim what you lost while they're still trying to reform an armour column. [This is an example of that strategy in motion](http://www.twitch.tv/buzzcutpsycho/c/1746157). We pulled out of Jaegar's Crossing and reformed a bait platoon at Jaegar's fist while an airstrike was mustered at the Warpgate. The armour gets shredded and Jaegar's crossing is attacked and recaptured. 

With your airstrikes consider the direction you want to attack from. Using an ESF's speed to sweep around and initially strike a column of tanks from the rear is [extremely effective](http://www.twitch.tv/buzzcutpsycho/c/1765622).

* Now assuming you're not stuck in your spawn room anymore let's talk about AMS Sunderers again. When defending a base you should think like this

1) Identify where the enemy would hide their AMS to threaten the base.

2) Identify where to hide your own AMS to best control those positions.

The capture points are incidental. This game is about logisitics, spawns points are those logistics. They facilitate both the capture and defense of bases. Here's a quick [mockup of Northern Weighstation](http://i.imgur.com/r5nlv.jpg). Red zones are primary postions and vectors of attack from elevation. Blue Xs are where the NC hide their sunderers to attack the base, Yellow Xs are where I hide mine to control these postions and prevent these attacks. 

This is a key point. With the exception of bases like Techplants, Biolabs, The Crown, Splitpeak and a few others you can't sit inside a base to defend it. **You need to defend the surrounding area**. Particularly points of elevation. In any attack or defense finding a point of elevation is key. It gives you great line of sight which allows you to put crippling fire onto any open area. Most importantly hills give you places to hide your AMS sunderers. If there is no elevation at a base like Indar Excavation you find the next best thing which is patches of hardcover. There's a reason you always see Sunderers parked behind those big red coral rocks. You need to defend these points and prevent enemy armour and Sunderers from taking the positions from you. To do this you need to place defensive AMS Sunderers at those positions as well. It doesn't hurt to have backup ones either. By the way if you've read this far props and put Pineapplesnapple in your comment if you make one.

* Now all of what I've said requires two things, firstly coordination. If you're Joe Casual running around getting stomped by a bunch of tanks my advice to you is the same that I give to everyone. **Join an Outfit**. You're not going to win against an armour column by yourself that's just the nature of the game. If you hate tanks that much you need to bite the bullet and join an Outfit. [There are plenty out there](http://planetside.wikia.com/wiki/Outfits), find one which suits you. I joined an outfit because I fucking hated Reavers spamming Breaker Rockets at me. Now there's always flak cover around me and I've never regretted making that decision.

Secondly, speed. Speed is the key. You can't wait around for people who are doing their own thing or umm and ahh about commands. You need to make a decision and take action. If it works it works, if doesn't then you reform somewhere else and launch a counter attack. You won't win every battle. If you're fast you can make alot of things happen. [Here's an example](http://www.twitch.tv/buzzcutpsycho/c/1762979). We pull out of a defense at Indar Excavation and allow the VS to move in. In return we're doing a quick mass hit on Mao Techplant to free up the TR Zerg which had been bashing their heads against it for the last 40 minutes. We land, destroy the Shields, the Vanu SCU, Sunderers, and capture the base. With the Techplant captured a massive airstrike is launched on Indar Excavation and wipe the armour and Sunderers that moved up in our absence.

There is a difference in being passionate about the game and being somewhere between unreasonability and insanity (seriously, go for a walk and breathe deeply) you see.

~~Rolling back entire server is unnecessary because every cert point you have (yes, that should cover even your passives,unless that is a separate value stored) is based on the ammount of experience you have, that includes double XP weekends and boosts.~~

~~A simple check of Total XP/250 can get an accurate ammount of certs you should have. If passives are calculated separately, it's just adding another Days since char creation*12 certs for basic and respective nominator for the boost level. As for medals, they are tracked as well, so this also should be a non-issue. That is all. If the check shows higher number of certs than you should have, simply substract the ammount from total and lock latest certifications again - those are tracked on your profile so data should definitely be there. From thre on, they can try to assign refunds correctly like nothing happened.~~

[PS2 Forum post](http://forums.station.sony.com/ps2/index.php?threads/bring-back-automated-turrets-from-ps1.56496/)

You can read my post for my in depth thoughts, but in essence, I feel like all base/tower turrets should be fully automated once again like they were in PS2.  They should shoot slow and have a short target acquisition range, but they should be accurate and operate themselves.  Also, they should retaliate when fired at (infantry included).

Currently, owning territory does not really give you much ""ownership"" over the land, other than the fact that it has your flag and implies that you might have players there.  Other than that, aircraft and ground vehicles are free to drive in and around your territory as they please with no consequences.  Being in enemy territory should FEEL like enemy territory.  Obviously a squad of vehicles and such should be able to take out an undefended base without much trouble, but this would further reduce the lone wolf mentality, and reinforce the idea that teamwork is necessary.

In Planetside 1, your bases offered some default protection from invaders in various forms (turrets, pain fields, door locks, shields, etc).  PS2 has added loads of new ways to attack a base, but has removed many ways to defend the base as well.

**TL:DR** - I think they should make base turrets automated against enemy aircraft/vehicles again like in PS1.

**Update:**

This would also be another potential objective point in bases as well.  There could be a Turret Control Room in each base.  The enemy could destroy the control panel which would shut down all turrets, or infiltrators could also hack the panel, turning the turrets against the base owners.  Just another idea :)

**Update 2:**

Other ideas I thought of and inspired from redditor comments.  Have the amp station provide the auto-turret bonus to make it more appealing to own.  An alternative would be to give all bases auto-turret engagement, but have the Amp station increase the lethality of auto-turrets, whether that be rate of fire, minimum distance to engagement, and accuracy.  The tech lab could give more direct turret buffs for both auto and player manned turrets, such as damage, max health, lock on capability, projectile speed, etc.

Some of those things could be incorporated into engineer only enhancements that they can install with resources.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,1354320251.0,,nc,True,t3_141x2d,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/141x2d/i_feel_that_the_automated_basetower_turrets_from/,

1339103723.0,196,self.Planetside,uqfn7,Just got back from playing Planetside 2 at E3. My thoughts.,Uberculosis,207,11,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/uqfn7/just_got_back_from_playing_planetside_2_at_e3_my/,"First off, muchos gracias to PS2 devs/SOE for creating a drop-in/drop-out playing experience at E3. For those of you who dont know, E3 is typically pretty boring unless you have a press pass and appoinments, otherwise youll be standing in lines all day to play a game for 30 minutes(looking at you, Borderlands 2)

First off, FPS. The game chugged a little bit at certain points, but for completely unoptimized code, I thought it ran pretty damn well. I never had difficulty in figuring out what was going on, even with all the chaos occuring around me.

Level design was excellent, with lots of nooks and crannies and cover interspersed around the base. If I found myself stranded away from cover in the open, it's because I made a conscious decision to risk it running across, rather than moving across a more-covered perimeter. There is the concern with rooms that appear purpose-designed to be rooms to fight over(big empty box with a control point in it) which is somewhat disappointing, but given the scale of the game, I feel it's easily overlooked.

The game looks even more gorgeous playing it than it is to watch streaming. Weapons have a definite weight, and are satisfying to shoot. The learning curve is simple, and it only takes you a few deaths to figure out how to play, and a couple more to figure out how to use your weapons effectively, so those of you going into the closed beta should be finely-tuned killing machines by the time the game is released.

The TTK seemed pretty reasonable to me. MAX units were able to take a lot of punishment, and dish out substantial amounts of their own, but their mobility was limited(they're slow, even while sprinting, and their ammo capacity[for NC at least]) is low enough so that you have to reload at least after every engagement, if not in the middle). I did go on a few terrifying murder-rampages, but it seemed very equitable to TF2's heavy in terms of killing capacity.

Class abilities are fun and definitely allow for some lateral thinking. When facing a MAX as a light assault around some pylons, I ducked in an out of cover, firing off a few shots, before jumpjetting atop one of the pylons, and getting in the killing blow before he could react. Heavy infantry is the bread-and-butter assault unit, and it's a lot of fun to be able to adapt to any situation thrown at you, whether it's a magrider thinking you're easy pickings, or a cluster of infantry.

All told, if this game cost money, I would buy it in is current state. I had a chance to gush to Higby(and I did!) and I just wanted to type this all out to let everyone know: Planetside is back, and it's better than ever.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,False,,tr,True,t3_uqfn7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/uqfn7/just_got_back_from_playing_planetside_2_at_e3_my/,

It doesnt have to be large, but big enough so that public Platoons/Squads will be more encouraged to fight as a pack rather than going off solo. I know people will think ohhh but this doesn't help the solo players, well it is a team game and imho i think more things like this should be added to encourage more squad/platoon play.

So what would happen for the Squad Leader ? Well , if he is close to a platoon waypoint/Squad waypoint, any kill or supporting action a platoon/squad team mate does would give bonus exp to them. This will encourage the leaders of squads/platoons to stay on waypoint/current objectives and encourage that he stays with the squad or platoon.

They have more staying power, more versatility, are cheaper, and can be used indoors.

The reason why MAX Units are simply superior to vehicles is because you can resurrect a MAX Unit. That means that it's completely impossible to kill a MAX Unit for good unless you overrun the position completely and make sure that the enemy team has no access to the corpse for several minutes. 

Vehicles by comparison can be taken out very easily at long range or with a suicide attack without actually having to push the enemy line away from the vehicle to make sure it stays dead. When a tank explodes for whatever reason it's gone, completely regardless of whether there are hundreds of friendlies still around it. Kill a MAX however and it won't stay dead unless you also kill all of his friends.


The reason why this really stinks is because the whole combined arms aspect of the game is really falling apart on this. Most cutting edge outfits organize around MAX teams at this point, because it's by far the most effective way of fighting. MAX Units can bring the armor and firepower to the front lines that usually only vehicles pack, but actually synergize with infantry support. They can go where infantry goes, they can operate in areas that provide their support team with adequate cover, and they can't be killed for good as long as their friends are still alive. 

On top of that MAX Units are cheaper to create, more universally available, and have the ability to switch their weapons out.


I don't see how the current setup with MAX Units being dirt cheap and infinitely resurrectable is in any way balanced with vehicles, which are expensive, and easy to destroy even if they have tons of backup. The one thing that people keep bringing up in defense of MAX Units is ""But a MAX Unit NEEDS support to be effective, and a vehicle does not"" - which may be true, but what good does that do a vehicle that's part of an organized outfit? You can do a little better without support, but if you do have support you only get a fraction of the benefits that MAX units get when they have support.

MAX Units have completely usurped the role of vehicles. They do a better job of it in almost every regard. MAX Units thrive to the point of being nearly unstoppable with enough friendly infantry support, while vehicles are easily taken out of the fight for good, even with tons of friendlies standing right next to them.

I think with these commander/officer-like customizations coming in the foreseeable future, this warrants a change. But not just because of cosmetics. If **Orbital Strikes** will be (more than likely) available through command certifications, we **don't** want every *mouth-breather* with certs left to spare be able to acquire it.

In my opinion, something as important as a **Command Rank** should have ***never*** been available for purchase with certs in the first place.

If you are *unwilling* to work as a leader, why should you get the benefits of a leader?

My proposition is to bring back the Command system from the first game, or something that is similar to it. (it doesn't have to be a copy-paste system, just something that is not as freely accessible as it is now)

To advance in Command rank, you need to earn Command Experience, which you could earn by:

* Leading a squad in a successful capture (requires you to be at the location/hex with at least half of your squad present)

* By setting up way points, attack/defend orders near objectives such as control points/generators/SCUs and through successful completion/destruction of those objectives

* Through successful completion of (upcoming) missions in the mission system

* The amount of CEP will vary based on the amount of enemies located at the hex/control point before and during the capture (to discourage ghosting). The more enemies, the more experience (although there is a cap)

* Any other ideas are welcomed

Note* Platoon leaders will not earn experience for every squad under their command, just their own

**Proposition on how you would be able to use OS: a combination of being a high enough CR rank and being a platoon (maybe squad) leader, along with some type of special resource. That resource could be built up when squads complete their objectives.**

*There can be lenience on things like squad beacons and being able to read command chat, making them a bit more accessible. Squad and Platoon leaders can have them by default. But beyond that, you should have to work for it.*

These are just a few ideas. What do you all think? 

Just keep in mind that this is **not** the only way. If you can come up with a mix of both CR experience and certs, shoot.

Also, for those interested in how the system worked in PS1

http://wiki.planetsidesyndicate.com/index.php?title=Command_Experience_Points

http://wiki.planetsidesyndicate.com/index.php?title=Command_Rank

As you can see, the rewards for being a Commander were not only special abilities, but also **cosmetic** upgrades, as well as a backpack to indicate that the person is of maximum rank.

I suspect that one of  the reasons they cant keep population up is that many people just ""don't see the point"". 

And honestly, as the game is now, they don't see the point because there is none. 

**Persistence**

Persistence is supposed to be an important aspect of the game, but it only takes a few hours for the map to become completely unrecognisable. Nothing you do ever matters in the grand scheme of things, and there is no reason to care about whether or not your faction wins the battle. Within a few hours everything will be different anyway. 

This is a serious issue because it completely undermines one of the most the fundamental draws of the game.

**New player expectations**

I don't have any data to back it up, but I'd bet more new players are avid FPS fans than MMO fans. As a result, most new players expect PS2 to play like other shooters, and give them a clear goal and direction. 

When they don't get a clear goal, one of two things usually happen. 

One is that, because they don't know what they ""should"" do, they assume they just don't understand the game, and give up. The other is that they decide to stick it through and learn the game, and what they learn is that there actually is no point to any of the battles, and that they can never win.

For many, when this sinks in, the only winning move is not to play.


**Player retention**

Its important to note that this is not just a problem with the new player experience, but its an issue which continues to get worse the more a person understands the game. The fact that the game is pointless takes time to sink in, and when it does either the player leaves, or they change their behaviour in ways which are bad for gameplay as a whole.

**Cert farming and player behaviour**

The more players who understand the game has no point, the more game play suffers for everyone, because people no longer play to help their team, but rather to farm certs. 

A clear illustration of this is the popularity of the crown. Not only is it a good source of certs, but it ""gives the game a point"" for many players, often to the point that that they would rather lose all other territory than lose the crown. 

Also, because certs are the only metric of advancement, zerging around capping bases without fighting becomes a viable tactic. Its viable despite the fact that it ruins gameplay for most people involved, and encourages people to work against their own faction by doing things like keeping enemy sundies alive and letting the enemy back cap their bases rather than defending. 

In all, it ends up causing players to always try to be on the winning side of every battle, because there is no point defending against a zerg when two hours from now the map will be completely different, yet the certs you get from getting easy kills stay with you forever.


**Possible solutions**


There are a lot of of ways of dealing with this, but I feel like I am far too close to TL:DR territory so here's one simple one that has no drawbacks. 

That is to add some ""victory condition"", even if it has no game play effects and is purely symbolic. The obvious choice for a victory condition is to capture all three continents. It is rare enough to make it interesting, but common enough to keep it achievable. 

Pursuing victory would be optional, however how many players decide to do it depends on how much players are made aware of the winner. They could display it on the map, give special decals, titles, or tags to the winning faction, or offer a small or large cert reward, or even small SC reward, or any combination of these. 

Again, it doesn't need to affect gameplay in any way for it to be effective, it just has to give people a chance to ""claim victory"" over the other factions.

Somewhere out there far beyond this system at ease with their lives I have family. I doubt I'll ever see them. They don't know it and they most likely never will, but, I'm fighting for them to keep them safe and to keep them in their happy lives so that they might have children and their children's children might get to enjoy the same luxury of safety and peace that they themselves are able to enjoy.

It... helps to think about that. 

From down here, it's never that simple. Hell. I can't sleep at night anymore and the worst part is I don't know if that's the shock or the nanites that restructure me after... after I die.

I killed a kid yesterday over a patch of land smaller than my old man's place back home. He must have been no older than sixteen. I was tending to wounded in Zurvan in the north tower along the wall after a particularly vicious New Conglomerate strike, and as I had my back turned to the entry way I barely caught the subtle whisper of a stealth field generator running low on power and disengaging.

I should have died.

 I was alone with the wounded and he was right there breathing heavily behind me, point-blank range with his gun at my back and safe and sound. Why didn't he shoot me? My own survival instincts screaming at me to do something, anything, while my animal brain barely managed to recognize what was happening. I could hear him whimpering, as if he's never seen this before. 

I had a chance. I Threw my meditool over my back and spun on my heel and closed the distance between us before he could react while pushing his aim aside with my right arm and reaching for my chainbade with my left. A single round spat out of his silenced magshot only to ricochet off the wall and into the distance as my chainblade tore into his chest cavity.

 It was messy.

 What I remember most wasn't his final words, but rather the conviction he spoke them with, ""For the Conglomerati"", beaming with the naive innocence of youth and the firm nearly fanatical dedication to a cause even at the very end. It wasn't until I removed his faceguard to identify the traitor that I saw how young he actually was. He must have been born on the ships, never even saw Home, Auraxis being the only home he's ever known.

I suppose, back on Earth, things would eventually return to normal after a near death experience like this. Maybe I would get a little PTSD, seek some help and move on with my life. 

No such luck here on auraxis. 

This kid? I've started calling him Blue, by the way, on account of the blue and black zebra stripe camo he wears. I've killed him at least eight times today. Do you know how it feels to have to take the life of someone who doesn't know any better? He blindly follows and fights against order for a ragtag group of terrorists in repurposed mining gear who proclaim that 'freedom at any cost' is an acceptable means to an end. The worst part is, ironically, his freedom comes at the cost of the freedom and sanctuary of humanity at large. I wish... I wish I could take the time explain that to him so that he would understand, but he made his choice and there is no room for weakness in the Republic, humanity depends on it.

After all, we need all the help we can get fending off the rocketspammers, right? 

Only, for the amount of time they spend actually alive, it seems like a waste of effort. It takes something in the area of a presidential administration to repair the things, and they die in seconds under any sort of fire, which they are always the first to absorb because they are:

* Coated in the thinnest of the paper armors.
* Completely exposed out in the open.
* Possessing of no defenses whatsoever.
* Dish out middling to somewhat okay damage to a single target.
* Except the barrels overheat because holy crap they'd be so OP otherwise.

Why would the AA turrets be places where they are most exposed to fire from sources they cannot fend off (vehicles, infantry)? Why would they have no defenses at all, not even little shield guards on the sides? Who even gets kills with the hilariously ineffective AI turret?

They're coffins on a lazy susan. I know that when I'm piloting a tank, I see them as little unmoving, easy-to-hit parcels of free XP, and not the dangerous, threaten defensive measures they are supposed to be. Another flaw in the base design that leads to the grinding, arduous TDMs that stand in for what should be proper base defense, they are a glaring design flaw and I would very much like to see them changed to be a more viable defensive tool.

-Q: What is the 4th empire?


-A: *The 4th empire is a group of individuals who value ""winning"" &amp; ""reward"" over the health &amp; integrity of a game.*


-A2: *Having alts on different factions does not mean a player belongs to the 4th empire.*


**"" I've heard of this 4th empire, but I deny its existence.""**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lets go back in time to August 28th, 2012. GW2 servers go live for the first time. It was here that I realized the undeniable power &amp; scope the 4th empire would have on all MMO's to come. In the weeks that followed the release of GW2 entire servers would be abandoned. A mass exodus would take place unknown to many.
Why? Much like Planetside GW2 has a pvp environment known as ""World vs World"". In WvW 3 servers battle one another over 4 maps for dominance. What would happen is, 1 server would gain the lead. Sensing their defeat, the warriors of the 4th empire would then switch to the winning server. This went on for months. Entire server populations vanished. It wasn't until A-NET forced people to pay real money to transfer servers that the populations finally settled.





**What does this have to do with Planetside 2?**



It has everything to do with Planetside 2. The #1 concern of almost every server is ""Population Balance"". Perhaps you yourself have noticed a interesting trend where a 1 faction is certain to win a alert &amp; suddenly the opposing 2 factions populations plummets &amp; the winning factions population doubles. This is the work of the 4th empire.
While it is most commonly seen close to the end of alerts, this is a common day occurrence that impacts every player on every server. Whether it be to switch factions because they have the north warpgate on Indar, because 1 faction has a imbalanced weapon, or simply to teamkill a player they couldn't on their main. The 4th empire is a serious issue &amp; it should be discussed.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,1368537298.0,,,True,t3_1eb3zu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1eb3zu/history_repeats_itself_the_4th_empire/,

I really like the new longer capture timers as it allows outfits to react to resecure bases and promotes good fights.  

But when the fight dies down and the defenders are trapped in their spawn room its very silly that attackers have to sit there and camp them until the timer expires.  If they leave, the defenders will just come back out and take the points.  It's not very compelling game play.  

There needs to be an scu (or similar mechanic) at each base that can be taken down that (a) stops defenders from spawning (b) either drops the shields or introduces a pain shield inside the spawn room -to push the defenders out.  This would be beneficial to defenders as well as it would move them back to the next base and allow them to set up a defense rather than cheesing kills through a one-way shield.

I'm in favor of an SCU type option as it allows an outfit to Gal Drop back onto the SCU and bring the facility back up so that it can be recaptured.  Perhaps that SCU could only be overloaded once the base is a certain % capped and all points are in control of the attackers.

(See 24 April for the missing panel)

I am banned.  I have been banned for the last month and, yes, I am innocent.
I used to play on Briggs.  Mostly NC, the AUNC. 

By Request, my character is [GunsmithJoe](https://players.planetside2.com/#!/5428026242699090529)

Now, my problem here is that there was no review done.  I was banned purely on a statistic.

* I had a 12-month subscription, with one month used.
* I had the NVidia EU premium bundle unlocks
* I had 20,000 SC floating, plus numerous unlocks
* (Total spent is around USD$300)
* I was not even given the consideration of having a GM look into these allegations, just banned on spec.

I was banned for 'speed hack'.  In my responses to the ticket I missed where this was stated, and was progressing with the assumption that I was accused of aimbot/esp.  But what really makes this bad is the absolute incomepetence, ignorance or just simple arrogance of the ""Customer Service"" staff.  I do not stream, and I do not record my play sessions... therefore I apparently have no defence.

~~After realising that the accusation was actually speed hacking I had an idea about what may have triggered the statistic.  Driving a sunderer off a cliff in such a way as to land the wheels in the downward slope of a small hill which then gently levels out to flat ground.  This enables the suspension to gradually bleed off the vertical velocity without taking damage.  The upshot of this is that if you're not braking you can get a very momentary but rather large speed boost.  It is my theory that this is what caused the 'speed hack' statistic to trigger as I have little doubt I would have been travelling faster than would normally be possible.~~ Smed says this isn't the reason, so now I'm absolutely clueless as to why I'm banned.

My Ticket tracking  (image) is available @ [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/mSZXGhE.png)

I am both curteous and understanding, albeit somewhat impatient at the end.
But I was **ignored**.  The ticket has now been closed because SOE did not respond in time...

No effort was made to understand my position, no apparent effort was made to even REVIEW the alegations, or this so called 'evidence'.

Personally, I'm at a loss.  I don't know how I want to proceed after these events.
Should I try and get myself unbanned?
Should I simply walk away, and warn off others?
SOE already has my money, apparently they don't care either way.


-------
Update:

Well, I called.

The lady on the other end was quite friendly and helpful as far as she could be, but due to the intricacies of banning and appeals, she could only refer me to submit a web ticket.

Here's hoping (or I may suggest in time) that a GM will make themselves available for a phone call.

Update:

I opened a new ticket today to find out what was going on.

 I haven't seen anything about the refunds for multiple common pool purchases for my retroactive account unlocks, am I missing it somewhere or has it been delay/omitted again?

I am grateful for account unlocks, don't get me wrong, but there was alot of Dev/CSR talk about this feature being retroactive and they said that they were ""working on a solution for people who had multiple unlocks"" of the same item, then the topic just sort of disappeared from the Dev radar......

Anytime I have seen it asked on any of the mediums for conversing with the devs, be it Reddit / Twitter / Official Forums, it goes unanswered as much of the questions have regarding account unlocks....

I would love to see the Reddit community get behind this issue so we can find out if or when this is going to be implemented? 


[UPDATED: There are ""no plans to do a mass refunds for multiple item purchases on accounts""]

So where does that leave players who were buying multiples still after account unlocks were announced because of the multiple SOE employees posting about refunds and ""solutions"" for those of us who had more than one item purchase?

This, combined with how SOE handled passive cert gain is becoming very disheartening. I'm also even more upset by this because they never clarified anything with account unlocks or multiple item purchases despite announcing them months before they went live today......

Infact.......I'm 90% certain I made it public on Reddit before ANY SOE official response was ever made, that account unlocks would be ""common pool items"" only......that should say alot about how horribly this stuff has been communicated. ]",,False,self,t5_2s48x,1363894410.0,,,True,t3_1aqdu6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1aqdu6/am_i_missing_account_unlock_refunds/,

1357233007.0,184,self.Planetside,15w9at,A few quirks/little known info i've complied so far (more to come).,ylca,223,39,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/15w9at/a_few_quirkslittle_known_info_ive_complied_so_far/,"A small list of a few quirks i've learned and wish I knew when i started:


**Voice/communications**

- ESC &gt; Social Tab &gt; Voice and Chat &gt; (right corner) Voice Options

- Each tab (General, Outfit, Squad, Platoon) has a voice options section *these are individual settings for that channel* 

- My Personal Settings are Leader 50%/ Prox 60% / Platoon 70% / Squad 95% (reverses if i'm squad lead/ platoon lead)

- **ALT (Default) frees your mouse. You can mute people who are currently talking as well as immediately adjust their sound.**

- ESC &gt; Social Tab &gt; Voice and Chat &gt; (right corner) Voice Options

- Seriously, enable voice. This isn't XBOX Live by any stretch, most communications outside the 
warpgate are tactical with the odd complaint/DJ. If you're inclined you can simply completely 
mute proximity and still be able to hear Squad/Platoon. There is next to no reason not to have 
voice enabled, it's too well designed and too useful to leave idle.

- The voice over commands are bound to V by default. In particular V-1 (Thank you) and V-8 (Sorry) make the game a more pleasant place.

**SQUAD/PLATOON**

- press P to join a platoon or quickly access your platoon info. All the squads you see are actively seeking public members. Planetside 2 is a large game, better played with a team than alone. 

- Squad/Platoon members show up as numbers on the minimap along with the color of the squad they are in

- If you are not in a squad [insert] attempt to put you in the nearest open squad in an area

- This isn't standard but a common sense voice priority would be Prox &gt; Squad &gt; Platoon with general chatter and info on immediate ground targets on prox, (immediate orders/updates/questions), and tactical level chatter on platoon (sunderer locations, requests for armor/air assistance/squad leader coordination). 


**MAP**

- When hovering above a hex on the left side of the screen will be Region data. In the box a rough estimate of enemies is given  Enemies &gt; Squad &gt; Squads &gt; Platoon &gt; Platoons. This is useful information when planning where to fly or to take a small squad. Platoons Detect is almost always an indicator of a good fight, but is also often a place where ESF accidentally go to die.

- In the filters Section Checking [Squad/Platoon] and [Allies] will give you more information on your surroundings. I believe there is a limit, however knowing the location of the nearest swarm of armor/air can be a lifesaver.



**MINIMAP**

- Any unit that fires without a suppressor (not sure on flash suppressor) shows up as a red dot/icon on the minimap for a split second.

- All vehicles without the Vehicle Stealth upgrades appear on any enemy infantry/air/vehicle 

minimap (not just those with active detection upgrades) within a certain distance.

- Vehicles/Air With Vehicle Stealth will still flash on map as normal when firing.

- Solid stationary red dots/Icons on the map are glitched. All actively spotted vehicles will 

fade at least occasionally as the ""enemy spotted"" effect wears off and is reapplied.

HUD

- The minimap can be enlarged (default H). Usefulness is Air&gt; Vehicle &gt; Infantry due to differences in movement speed and the fact that large mode covers the bottom left compass leaving infantry without a quick reference.

- Under SETTINGS &gt; GENERAL [Draw Hud] can be unchecked for an interesting cinematic experience.

- Under SETTINGS &gt; GENERAL [Centralized HUD Mode] enables an alernate HUD view. Try unchecking to see which you prefer.

- The orange Arrow is your Platoon Waypoint. Green Arrow is Squad Waypoint, and Blue is Personal.

**GENERAL INFANTRY**

- Q, (default) spots enemies near the crosshair. Spotting is useful as it paints a short lived red dot on the minimap for your allies, as well as a red arrow however spotting is *extremely* loud. If making a flank keep in mind that spotting an enemy is half-spotting yourself and is only useful if some sort of friendly support is in the area. 

- Medics can revive your body for at least 20 seconds after you have the option to deploy. If you immediately redeploy when you die (especially on a sunderer) you skipping an opportunity to be revived right at the fight. 

- Related, a revive doesn't have to be accepted immediately. If there is still gunfire in the background a player can wait for the resolution instead of reviving into gunfire.

- Cover is effective and currently too rarely used. Often an enemy will empty a full magazine into cover giving you time to casually step out and take safe shots. This will change over time, but for now don't join the ranks of Civil War Re-enactors, move from cover to cover.

-You can set a personal waypoint by right clicking on the map tab. Many friendly vehicles have radar, occasionally opening the full map will sometimes show the location of an enemy sunderer which you can then mark and destroy. Don't spend time staring at the map, but if you see a blip on your minimap, looking on the map then dropping a point before it disappears again can be helpful.

Waypoints are also good for marking the location of an enemy assault or flank when you die. After death personal waypoints can be marked by hovering to the map tab and selecting manually (rather than attempting to use the death screen minimap).

**MAX**

- The engineer tool is not the medic gun. Movement while being repaired will break contact and lead to a frustrated engie. If receiving repairs *stand still* until you are healed.

- With an engineer you are almost impervious to a substantial amount of small arms fire and are larger in size than all other classes. As bullets cannot travel through targets, if you can co-ordinate with another max and an engineer you can create a line of mutually beneficial safety.

- MAX suits gain accuracy while crouching, always crouch when using bursters. In anti Infantry situations crouching is a situational toss up between accuracy and providing extra cover for friendlies to the rear.

**MEDIC**

- F(default) is both a self heal and an area of effect heal.

- The ability to self heal makes Medics one of the most survivable if they allow their shields to recharge between damage.


**ENGINEER**

- Explosives dropped stay until detonated, logging off, or destruction by fire or nearby explosions. This means you can quickly switch between loadouts to set up a full defense and then back to your prefered combat class.

- Two mines will kill an base sunderer and any other vehicle in the game. Mines can be dropped directly on a target for a C4 like effect.

- Press B (default) on your turret to create an ammo pack. You can drop an ammo pack this way *and* use your turret.

- Your turret also doubles as a sniper rifle, hasty cover, and a ladder.


**LIGHT ASSAULT**

- Jetpacks are usable at lower levels but really start to shine past level 4

- 1 C4 will take a lighting into critical damage (burning) 2 will kill any main battle tank and put a sunderer in critical damage.

- Drifter Jets have horizontal thrust and ski up slopes slowly but have a significant fuel reserve, Jump Jets have high vertical/decent horizontal thrust, but have limited fuel. Personal usage: Jump jets for interior combat zones, Drifter for travel/open field combat.

- Currently there is a bug that makes jump jets stop functioning, the only fix is relogging.

**GENERAL VEHICLE**

- [PgDwn](default) is vehicle permissions. When locking to squad you kick everyone below that permission, to self everyone but yourself. Next to the names in this interface are red Xs for kicking passengers individually

- Setting Vehicle permissions to Squad allows squadmates to drive/pilot your vehicles as well. This is useful for moving a vehicle under siege, but away from it's owner. If someone jacks your vehicle they can still be kicked using the [PgDwn] menu

- The Expanded minimap is more useful to Armor/Air than infantry due to your speed. Air should consider almost constantly using the maxed minimap.

- **Every vehicle land and air performs significantly better with the first performance upgrade they choose (exception: rival only for sunderer).** The choice of frame generally doesn't matter, but for land vehicles all frames give a noticeable boost to handling no matter their description. Many are turned off to air/land vehicles due to sluggishness, however rank 1 of a performance slot makes all craft workable.


**ARMOR**

- Damage is increased by location, from lowest received damage to highest Front Armor &gt; Side 

Armor &gt; Rear Armor &gt; Top armor.

- Vehicles can use cover as well. Use natural terrain to your advantage.

- Using cover and mobility vehicles can last for a significant amount of time, remember to always spawn as an engineer and repair sooner than later. 50% health might seem like a lot while you're only taking front hits, but below 60% health on a MBT and below *full* on a lightning (c4 leaves a sliver of health) is risking destruction. 

**GENERAL AIR**

- Spacebar is hover and will save your life

- Ctrl and C (by default) are descend, when you are belly up anti-grav tech causes descending to stabilize you. 

- **Aircraft do not need forward thrust to stay airborne.** All the aircraft are hover-enabled by default simply using the spacebar and the optional hoverframe makes them more so. Many pilots fly their ESF and other craft as if they can stall, when in actuality stopping in mid air is not only possible, but a valid combat tactic and a vehiclesaving technique.

- Your forward thrust is a throttle not a pedal. You can set a speed and leave it, or pull back, it's always cruise control. Maximum speed is not necessary at all times and causes more crashes than it saves pilots from maneuvers. In an emergency situation remember that you can hold down [S] to dump all throttle while tapping [spacebar] to give yourself time to think. 

- All flight functions need to be thought of in a 3d space. To illustrate this, Spacebar is ""hover"" which is good from a belly down sense, but when you put your nose straight up ""hover"" becomes ""downward z thrust"". Sounds confusing but is a complicated way to say that when you press hover flying normally you hover, but if you point your nose up and press hover you'll go backwards. If you understand how your forward and vertical thrust are pushing you you will have a significantly easier time learning maneuvers.

- To flip your mosquito slowly raise throttle [W] while holding descend [ctrl] and pitch down [bind a button to this the mouse isn't fast enough]

All too often I have used the enemy activity overlay and hotspots only to run into an enemy zerg with no friendly units in sight.

It isn't an exaggeration though. The concept was amazing, the tech just wasn't there yet. 

Now we have the tech for Planetside 2 and it is shaping up to be an amazing game but I am afraid that it will still be ahead of it's time but for different reasons. Planetside 2 is going to combine two crowds that have conflicting points of view on how games do and should work. It is already beginning to show in the complaints and suggestions I see both here on r/Planetside and the official forums.

On the one hand, you have MMORPG people. The main complaint I see coming from this crowd is the lack of character growth. They can't seem to stand that you can only have one ""upgrade"" from certs at a time. 'Why do I have to choose top speed or air brakes on my scythe?' they ask. 'Can't I just have both after certing for it?' They don't seem to understand that one of the mainstays of Planetside is that a new person should be as capable of killing a day 1 veteran, if they have the skill, as anyone else. In an RPG, time means growth. In Planetside, time means options. This does not seem to sit well with them.

From the FPS crowd the persistence seems to make them uneasy. Victory conditions and instancing is the big thing I keep hearing from them. 'Why don't we have someone win everyday and we reset the continent?' 'What if we had arenas for infantry battles only?' These kind of suggestions have no place in Planetside. I am not saying they are bad ideas, they just aren't for this game. The saying is 'For Land. For Power. Forever.' Not 'For Land. For Power. Until the server resets.'

I am worried that these two groups will just never see eye to eye on anything. Instead of a huge, successful game we are going to get two camps that are both equally unhappy. I, and my fellow PS1 vets, will be sitting in the middle trying to show them what a brilliant game we have here but they won't ""get it."" Planetside 2 is not a game with a broad concept. It has a specific concept built on 10 years of Planetside and I am afraid that will be lost in the shuffle.

1362305449.0,179,self.Planetside,19kl1m,"[Suggestion] When releasing new items for the full price, permanently lower the price of some of the old items in the same category.",DonMarani,216,37,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/19kl1m/suggestion_when_releasing_new_items_for_the_full/,"Hello /r/planetside,

as we all probably agree, PS2 has one of the better F2P systems. Free players are only behind in the time it takes to unlock weapons, but they are not completely blocked from doing so like in other F2P games, and most items are just ""sidegrades"".

The dev team releases new items at quite a fast rate, and those are always set at the full price of 1000 certs / 700 SC. There is nothing really wrong with that, the cash shop is the primary revenue source of the game, and paying players (me included) have no issues with stocking up on SC and buying the good stuff when it gets released, because there is no other game that compares to PS2 on the market.

However, the cert screen gets more and more filled with items that are set at the magical price of 1000 certs, which is really a high number for free players. So why not simply permanently lower the cert costs of some (not all) weapons and unlocks that are in the game for a long time, when new stuff gets released for the same category? 

* There would be no significant, if any, impact on SOEs revenue stream. Paying customers bought most of the items they want a long time ago with SC or on daily deals, and the primary revenue source is the release of the newest and greatest stuff like the pump-action shotguns that players trial and buy as soon as those hit the live servers just because they are new and cool. Again, nothing wrong with that.

* It would increase the excitement of the non-paying playerbase for patches that release new items - while those are not immediately available for the F2P crowd without a huge cert investment, they get access to some of the tried and tested stuff of the same category at a much more reasonable price.

* New players starting the game would not get the feeling that the game is ""P2W"" that comes with seeing the cert screen, where more and more stuff is set at 1000SC with every update. Instead, old stuff that most players already have is more accessible to them, and the barrier of entry is lower. 

This would make the game a lot more attractive to free players, who make the game fun for us paying crowd. They may not have access to the new fancy toys, but are not that far left behind in unlocking the ""essentials"".

To illustrate my point, here are some examples:

* They release the new pump-action shotguns at 1000c/700SC, but in the same patch, lower the price of the 6-round Mauler (and equiv.) to 250 certs and the Sweeper to 500 certs. Free players may not get the one-hit kill shotguns without paying, but they get access to a reasonably good shotgun for only 250 certs. Shotguns for everyone!

* The MANA AV turret costs 1000 certs, but it is a very useful tool for AT specialized engineers. So if they add faction specific AI turrets for the engineer (like a shotgun turret for the NC!) in a few months, the AV turret gets its price lowered to 500c/700SC, making it a lot more accessible to free players.

* Faction specific rocket launchers will come at GU4.1, bringing the total count of 1000 cert launchers to 5 for the HA, while free players are stuck with the stock dumbfire launcher. So after the same update, the NS Decimator is unlocked with 250c/500SC (as it is a niche launcher anyway) and the faction specific G2G/G2A launchers only cost 500c/700SC each. Free players don't get the fancy and fun new launchers, but at least they have easier access to the tried and true lock-on launchers.

* People are somewhat pissed that SOE released a long range sniper rifle (LA80 for NC) or a new SMG, and released a weapon that is slighly better in the core stats a week later. How about releasing the second batch of new weapons not a week, but at least a month or two later, while lowering the first SMG to 500 certs and the first high-powered sniper to 250 certs? F2P Infiltrators would get access to a good sniper rifle and a SMG at a reasonable cert investment.

* We get the MAX flamethrowers for 1000 certs each, but F2P players also get to have fun with their MAXes because the second AI weapon arm (Scattergun, Heavy Cycler, etc.) is reduced to 250 certs, and both Mattocks (and eqiv.) cost 500 certs each.

Free players would be as excited for updates as the paying players, prices wouldn't stay inflated, and new players are more likely to stay when they see that older, but still good sidegrade weapons get cheaper for them, while the paying crowd gets day-one access to the new toys and cosmetics. What does the subreddit think?

**TL;DR: Lower the cost of some old items when new stuff gets released for that category. Free players get easier access to stuff paying players already have, SOE doesn't lose any significant revenue while freebies are more likely to stick around.**",,False,self,t5_2s48x,1362305682.0,,nc,True,t3_19kl1m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/19kl1m/suggestion_when_releasing_new_items_for_the_full/,

1376480090.0,177,self.Planetside,1kcbw2,Suggestion: Raise the flight ceiling.,youngavlol,228,51,158,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1kcbw2/suggestion_raise_the_flight_ceiling/,"The current flight ceiling is too low. During aerial combat I frequently run into the flight ceiling, destroying evasive maneuvers or the shot my Dalton gunner had set up. On Indar at the southwest Warp Gate the ceiling is within lock-on range from the ground in the adjacent areas. Pilots could greatly benefit from a higher ceiling. 

* When dogfighting, crashing into the ground/terrain wouldn't have to be as much of an issue. 

* Approaching a territory from a much higher altitude would give bombers, scouts, and transports a better element of surprise and better escape avenues. 
* With more space for aircraft there is the possibility of strict air combat becoming more prevalent, reducing the amount of ground troop harassment.

* And lets be honest, approximately one kilometer above sea level isn't exactly a realistic limitation to aircraft.

I also think that instead of just hitting the ceiling and being bumped back down, aircraft should stall for around 3-5 seconds. Stalled aircraft would have lowered maneuverability and no ability to accelerate until the aircraft is no longer stalled. The ""restart"" period for a stalled aircraft would begin after the aircraft passes back below the ceiling. So if an aircraft approached the ceiling at a steep angle and high speed, momentum would carry it further into the stall zone, lengthening the period in which the aircraft is in a lowered mobility state. Thoughts?

**[EDIT]** To those that are mistakenly thinking this will make A2G overpowered: Giving air more space will not magically turn them into sniping Orbital Strike machines. The way ground and air can attack each other wouldn't change.

**[EDIT 2]** I think I need to clarify this even more after all of the comments about it. A hightened ceiling will not give air more of an advantage over ground. There are already MANY instances where I have to decrease altitude for my Dalton gunner's targets to render. *That's with the current ceiling.* If I can all of a sudden go even higher than that, what makes you think targets will magically render at a further distance than they wouldn't before? 

Dive bombing ESFs: For an ESF to have targets to shoot at, it must be within a certain range. Lifting the ceiling to a greater height will not increase the distance that a plane can attack from. Even if the ceiling were raised and a fighter came it at maximum altitude then proceeded to happen to know where a target was, in an area below him that is not rendering, and dive bombed it, you would still see it just as soon as if it came in from the current altitude cap. 

This will separate ground and air: How often do pilots pod infantry? A lot. How often do liberators hover around and pick off infantry and armor with their dalton/zephyr? A lot. These are the support roles that people are claiming don't get taken advantage of, or will be ruined by a higher ceiling. This is not the case. Those people that are going to take out infantry and armor are going to do it anyway. Those people that only look for dogfights are going to do it anyway. That won't change. What it will change is how effectively the supporting aircraft can handle threats from the aircraft hunting other aircraft. There are countless times that I've been shot down by ESFs or libs while trying to take out armor for my squad/platoon/outfit because I hit the ceiling and it prevented me from effectively engaging the threats. Having shots lined up only to lose them because the ceiling thrusts you back down can get you killed pretty easily. 

Lastly; There would be too much room, we wouldn't be able to find targets: I'm not proposing they raise the ceiling to the stratosphere, I'm suggesting they raise it to a reasonable height that allows pilots to more effectively deal with incoming threats without being messed up by a low ceiling limiting their maneuverability. And most importantly, the terrain is not level and there are problem areas where planes cannot escape lock-on and AA range. If I leave my warp gate, the immediate territories are too high in altitude for me to achieve a safe flying height. This isn't fair. MAXes can be revived, rockets are free, phalanx turrets have unlimited ammo, and planes have a cool down and a resource cost. (Yes, MAXes have a resource cost as well but they can be revived and a plane cannot.) 

For those of you who think ""We won't be able to shoot at every aircraft that tries to fly by without attacking us, that isn't fair to G2A."": Don't be a hero. Don't be greedy. Just because you see something does not mean you absolutely have to kill it. If it is out of range or is escaping, call it out, spot it, inform some of your factions pilots, whatever, and let the people who can deal with it deal with it. G2A is not meant to be plopped down on a hilltop in the middle of the map or on the landing pads of the Crown and be able to hit every plane on the continent. They are meant to give a means to fight something that is an immediate threat to you or just being careless and entering your effective range.

The only con to this that I can see is the possible load it would take on the game, though I don't see how another 500-600 meters of empty sky would be that taxing. This is coming from someone who is not a career pilot. I merely enjoy flying when it is beneficial and dislike things that break the effectiveness of the assets.",,False,self,t5_2s48x,1376501796.0,,vs,True,t3_1kcbw2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Planetside/comments/1kcbw2/suggestion_raise_the_flight_ceiling/,

I know that this is going to be a major concern over the next few weeks, but it will get better.

Basically this is the game I have been waiting for ever since I first started playing shooters. A massive world with massive battles. Real teamwork that actually works.

But I have a fear that this game will slip into obscurity because of low retention rate for new players. Browsing the [user reviews at metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/planetside-2/user-reviews) should illustrate the point. All the people who fall through the cracks because of a high learning curve, and general frustration that stems from that. These people might have been dedicated players now instead of dragging down the review scores for this epic game.

Of course all of us hardcore PS2 players (BR86, 600hrs here) want to have more metagame and lategame stuff that makes us want to stick around. Yes I want this, and I am just as sick of Indar as the rest of you.

However I am perfectly willing to let that wait a while in favor of something that will help new players stick with the game. Things like a tutorial. Things like facilitating contact between new players and established outfits. Things like easier to understand menus and game concepts.

This game isn't any fun unless there are enemies to be fought, and new potential players more often than not fall through the cracks, leaving us with a fraction of the potential player growth we could have.

Remember guys the better this game does when it comes to amount of players, the more fun we will have and the more SOE will put resources into it. I am absolutely loving it here, and I think I will want to play this game for a long time going forward. I would want SOE to have a problem with overpopulated servers rather than underpopulated ones. 

In the long run we will be better off if this gets fixed first.

I also want to urge the current players to be as helpful and patient as possible towards newbies. Did a BR1 tk you for no apparent reason? Is that because he is a griefer, or just that he doesn't know left from right yet in this game? How you react to that might be the difference between a new member of the community, and someone never launching the game again.

They're going to bloat their weapon pool and burn everyone out on chasing the latest, potentially OP, toy. Besides, it's totally unsustainable as a long term income strategy. Honestly, I think they ought to give the weapons a rest entirely for a bit. We just got a new shotgun, which was cookie-cutter across factions, and SMGs in the last month or so. Meanwhile, they've yet to produce a single cosmetic accessory for any vehicle or class that I think looks better than the default. If PS2 plans to have any longevity, they need to slow way down the weapon releases and greatly accelerate and expand the cosmetics.

Matt Higby had this to say &gt;""I see our role on the development team as curators of the game, not necessarily the wellspring of all ideas.""



Organized in conjunction with Azure Twilight and SOE, the /r/planetside subreddit will be voting for the 5 best ideas curators to be present at different Community Design Meeting's, all streamed live on twitch.tv/azuretwilight.

So here is how this works, every time there is a C.D.M., a topic will be announced at least a week prior. Players will then put together their best proposals in audio, video, or text form. Players will then submit them to reddit using a predetermined tag. Redditors will upvote/downvote and discuss the ideas, the 5 posts with the most upvotes will have their authors be eligible to attend, then talk with the developers about their idea, getting real feedback along the way.

**This first C.D.M., with Matt Higby and Tramell Issac will be the following:**

**Metagame - Community Design Meeting**

**Saturday - January 26th 2013 - 12 PM PST**

**twitch.tv/azuretwilight**

*Use the following prefix for this meetings ideas :*

[Metagame Design Meeting Idea] **OR** [MDMI]

*All Proposals must be in by Midnight PST 01/23.*

Thanks and I cant wait to see what you all come up with! Lets change this game together!

So, with the ESF update right around the corner this seems like as good a time as any to finally fix it. It's such a basic and fundamental issue, anyway, it should've never even been a problem in the first place, being right up there with normal FOV, ADS sensitivity, good mouse control, etc; anything that is so direct to the experience of the game, let alone makes your players motion sick, should be at the top of your priority list and its solution should suffer no delay.

For example, most recently, the cert bonus that was given. ""Oh no, it messed up the leaderboard"" Honestly, **who cares?** For the first couple months if memory serves me correct, the leaderboard wasn't even working. Who cares if someone has more certs than you? Did you REALLY think they would give back $$ or give back game-points (like... internet points?). It's silly to get upset at. 

Many weapons get nerfs, get buffs, all kinds of things. I, for example, noticed the much reduced lock-on times for the striker in the PTR. Not to mention the rockets seem to fly at near 50% faster speeds than they do now in the live realms. Is this something they will keep? Who knows. 

I'm seeing all kinds of new and exciting ideas. They are (mostly) listening to their fan-base with regards to some things. They are actively communicating with us and keeping us up-to-date with certain things. It's nice to have. Many games we PURCHASE release, maybe have 1 or 2 DLC, and that's it. This game is constantly evolving and constantly changing. Yes, some of it I may not be a huge fan of but this game to me is still better than a lot of the crap that is out there.

It keeps my attention. I enjoy playing with large groups. I enjoy the longer base caps now to keep fights going! No more 30-second base caps and that is it. On to the next! No. It's nice to be able to actually have to WORK to take a base.

I think they have taken some great steps and some not-so-great ones. Either way, I'm a fan. I plan on staying. You guys have to remember, it's just a game, enjoy it!

This causes situations where a faction could be without any armour and air cover. This change would also allow warpgated factions to push out of their warpgate more easily; being warpgated isn't exactly fun and could cause people to rage quit (Possible customers leaving is bad for SOE).
A significant reduction in the cost of spawning vehicles would be required. I suspect this mechanic wouldn't be too abused by overpopulated factions as the distance to travel to the front line would be too big. 
REMEMBER SOE ARE RAISING THE COST OF VEHICLES!!! -A flash (Yes, that flimsy little thing) will cost 150, I understand lots of people just use the wraith cloak and fury but 150 is far too much.

I realize this works fine if you have two monitors but it doesn't for one.  
Here is my monthly plea to fix Borderless Windowed mode. I am aware you can modify the client with a script to allow this mode to work.  However given that SoE issued a very succinctly stated 

&gt;It is vital that you not run software which modifies the Planetside 2 client in any way. If you do this, you are indistinguishable from various hacks that work in the same manner. The result of this is that you will be banned from gameplay and lose your characters/items.

&gt;We cannot make exceptions to this. We do understand there are relatively harmless apps that fall in this category, but if we allowed those they would simply be used as a shield excuse by players trying to cheat. This same rule applies to data that Planetside 2 uses for gameplay. Do not modify any of these files or attempt to modify them in memory.

&gt;There are some applications that modify the windows or directx environment without changing the client. These may also result in suspensions unless we specifically exempt them and declare them ok to use. 

&gt;The most simple guidance here is do not use third party programs which change the Planetside 2 gameplay in any way unless it has been specifically cleared by SOE.

&gt;The above does not apply to user initiated *.INI changes, those are allowed, although setting your own options incorrectly can result in bugs.

I really don't see any reason we should have to modify our client with what should be a very simple fix on their side placed into any given game update.
