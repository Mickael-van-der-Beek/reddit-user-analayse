To them there's no inherent benefit to you going out and fulfilling your life's passion. They're not going to enjoy it in the same way you would. However, they WILL feel the pain when you fail. And when that happens they don't want to feel in any way responsible.  

Keep this in mind the next time someone tries to talk you out of a creative pursuit. There's no benefit in your success but they will feel responsible for your failure. When it comes to other people's goals, any person will always take the most conservative option because that will be the one with the best risk/reward ratio.

During Mufasa's reign Pride Rock is in a period of a fair amount of prosperity (enough food, water, much singing and dancing).  During Scar's reign there is a distinct lack of these things and the atmosphere is somber.  This would indicate a preference by the creators of the film for Mufasa's reign.

The major political axiom of Mufasa's Pride Rock(MPR) is the Circle of Life (CoL).  The CoL basically states that it's OK for the lions to eat as many of the antelope as they can because eventually the lions will die and fertilize the grass.  The grass will then become food for the antelopes.

The CoL can then be seen as a type of ""trickle down economy"" where the ""meal creators"" at the top must have unlimited access to fuck up the lives of a few antelopes in order to maintain prosperity for the other creatures in their kingdom.

The second political dictum of MPR is that there must not be any crossing of the border into MPR by the hyenas.  This is much like the call by many Republican leaders to bar immigration.

So Mufasa = ""ideal Republican society""

Scar, on the other hand, represents what conservatives view as the cynical Progressive politician.  Scar hires a block of willing supporters (the hyenas) by offering handouts in the form of food taken from the ""meal creators.""  It's also interesting to note that the three main hyenas are black, hispanic, and special needs.  All three of these groups are, according to conservatives, the groups that abuse welfare organizations the most.

By promising his supporters perpetual donation in return for political power Scar devises a political coup in a musical number that features him as a fascist leader of a goose-stepping army of the ""moochers.""

Scar's Pride Rock (SPR) then becomes one where the burden on the ""meal creators"" to feed the welfare hyenas is so onerous that there is no food left.  Because of the social justice instituted by Scar, the CoL becomes unbalanced and the economy tanks.  

It's only when Simba returns and deposes Scar that he can return Pride Rock back to the land where, presumably, unrestricted market freedom (i.e. antelope eatin') leads to prosperity once again.

Some parts are so complex that they are self-aware, and can manipulate the universe to give it new abilities. 

One part of the universe has even made tiny patterns of atoms so that it can communicate with other parts of the universe like it, nearly instantly. Not only that, but in this network of electrons a whole new world has been created. 

The social world we experience is a *shared hallucination* created by natural selection, biology and our genes. After all, our senses, etc, give us a highly absurd representation of the world around us. It is because we all interpret the world in an identical/highly similar way that humanity 'works'. 

If that isn't weird enough, we've also taken it a step further and invented a whole new reality on our own terms - the internet. 

And so now these words appear on your screen. Just reading them, at least in a very trivial way, will effect the rest of your life, and the rest of what is to happen in the universe. We are all linked together in a super-fast, absolutely tiny, world of cause and effect.

It seems inevitible really. If things get more complex at a faster rate, eventually the universe will *catch up with itself*, so that one part of the universe (the human reality) can increase this complexity itself, without having to wait for incredibly slow processes like natural selection.

Humans have a natural tendency to want to achieve alpha dominance, power, respect, or attention. The crafters of modern entertainment media are starting to exploit this obsession we have by dangling their worthless e-carrots in front of our faces.

But even though we know that's what they're doing, we still fall into the trap anyway. As much as we know from an intellectual standpoint that Reddit karma is worthless, we still want it. 

We crave this feedback. That's why solitary confinement can quickly warp a person. We *need* human interaction to function. We need people to remind us we exist and tell us we have meaning.We all love the sound of our own voice, so to speak.

[The first video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xzU9Qqdqww) has Kid Cudi at a party, socializing, drinking, etc. Everyone around him is going in slow motion, except him of course.

In [the second video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z_Ys3BO_4M), we see Kid Cudi sleeping, falling into his couch, watching a TV, etc., mostly by himself. [Indica, another category of strain of marijuana, creates a “couch-lock”, I-don’t-want-to-move-a-muscle type high. Using indica is a great choice for those nights indoors watching TV, playing video games, or just chilling with close companions. The indica high numbs the body down and induces an overall sense of relaxation, which is ideal for a relaxing night’s sleep.](http://www.thcdigest.com/indica-vs-sativa/#sativa-vs-indica-q1)

We also see Kid Cudi's preferences reinforcing this theory. In [this interview](http://youtu.be/6b19hBWdyo0?t=1m6s), we see Kid Cudi's preference for indicas. This is reinforced by the [end of the first music video](http://youtu.be/7xzU9Qqdqww?t=4m), where he essentially cries alone in the bathroom, while no such scene exists in the other video, as well as reinforced by his concept of ""The Lonely Stoner"", as seen in [this interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXBURmFOrI8), further supporting a difference between the music videos and indicas and sativas for Kid Cudi.",,False,,t5_2s5se,False,,,True,t3_19sh9p,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/19sh9p/the_two_music_videos_for_kid_cudis_pursuit_of/,

I'll help you imagine it.,AtheismFTW,50,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/ky06t/how_big_is_the_universe_ill_help_you_imagine_it/,"The distance between the stars is incredible. Even traveling at the speed of light it would take decades, lifetimes in some cases, to get from one to the next.

But lets just imagine that you could travel orders of magnitude faster than the speed of light and could travel the mindbending distance between two stars in ONE SECOND.

With that ability, you'd feel like you have the power to explore the whole universe, right? WRONG!

There are upwards of 300 Billion stars in our galaxy, The Milky Way. Even if you could hop from star to star at a rate of one every second, that would take you 300 Billion seconds to travel to every star in the galaxy. In other words, it would take you about 9,507 years!

At an human average lifespan of 78.7 years, it would take you about 121 lifetimes of NON-STOP TRAVEL, even at that impossible speed, for you to visit every star in our galaxy!

Sit and think about that for a second before you move on.

But wait, our galaxy is only one of the many galaxies in our universe! There are upwards of 300 Billion galaxies in the universe!

300 Billion stars in the galaxy, and 300 Billion galaxies in the universe. That's 9X10^22 stars in the universe! 90,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (or 90 Sextillion)! 

It would take you about 36,300,000,000,000 (or 36.3 Trillion) lifetimes to travel to every star in the universe at the rate of 1 star per second. Or more! Some scientists think there may be 300 sextillion stars in the universe, which would more than triple the length of this already insane journey!

And that's still cheating, because at the speed of one star per second (which is about 1 Parsec per second, or 3.26 light years per second) doesn't take into consideration that the distances between the galaxies themselves is somewhere between 1 to 10 Million Parsecs.

In other words, even at the incredible speed of one star per second (one parsec per second) it would still take you almost FOUR MONTHS to travel from one galaxy to another. Four months times 300 Billion galaxies would add another 100 Billion years (or 1.27 Billion life times!) to this trip. 

So that's a total of 36,601,270,000,000 lifetimes to visit every star! Even at that impossible speed!

**Even if your lifespan was ONE BILLION YEARS, it would still take you 36,000 lifetimes to make this journey**!

Just think about that.

Keep in mind that this is just to pass by the stars. Not even to give you time to stop by the local planets and pick up a quick space burger or have any kind of fun at all :(

Dreams feel real because it's the experiences and emotions of the brain that trigger the subconsciousness. But when your dream self realizes it's dreaming you instantly understand that the world you believed to be real till that point isn't. There are no universal laws of physics, no limit to what can be done. You realize that it is something different than simple existence.
transcending it even.

For those brief powerful moments before the dream becomes unstable and you get thrown from it back into waking life, you are a god. You are the most powerful being that ever is was or can be.
And it's funny because the person you are in the dream isn't even you. It's a mental image of what you want to be. But that all powerful moment begs the question, if we can be gods in a realm we create, are we simply images and completely controlled entities in some dream?

* First Dimension - Length

* Second Dimension - Width

* Third Dimension - Depth

* Fourth Dimension - Duration, a timeline of our 3-D selves with infinite points.

* Fifth Dimension - The multitudes of 4D Lines, each one a different universe created through every action, like Schrodinger's Cat. IE, the universe I'm in now, the universe I'm a pirate in, the universe I died as an infant in, the universe I lived to 1000 years old.

* Sixth Dimension - The multitude of groups of universes, every person and 3D thing that could be affected in its lifetime.

* Seventh Dimension - All possible outcomes of our universe and everything in it, collected into one point.

* Eighth Dimension - The results of different initial conditions for different universes and the line that connects them.

* Ninth Dimension - The dimension you would be traveling through to reach different points in the eighth dimension.

* Tenth Dimension - A point representing the entirety of the ninth dimension.

Then, does that make God an organism that exists in the Eighth Dimension? If God is omnipotent and omniscient, he can see in 6D. He created Earth, so he created a point in the 7th Dimension, so he must exist in the 8th Dimension.

Imagine you drawing a stick figure on a piece of paper. That stick figure is two-dimensional. You created a multitude of points on a piece of paper, an infinite number of ""lengths"" to create ""width"". God created our infinity, our universe, our point in the Seventh Dimension. We are God's art project.

I imagine God to be a young artist in art school, we were his studio final that got an A. We're far from mastered and flawless, but we're beautiful and creative in our own way. Our universe is a happy universe despite its flaws. Maybe God is out of art school with a wife and kids. God keeps us on his mantle though, to help him remember the days he wood smoke a bowl and sculpt, paint, play guitar. We're his totally rad universe that the other God bros think looks cool when they see it in his house.

""I have heard people wonder aloud how it is possible for a person to lack faith in God. They look at the world and see countless examples of evidence for his existence. How can it be that I can look at the same things and remain unconvinced? I think the evidence in our world is inconclusive for any ideology, and the idea of God is far too important to me to apply anything less than the best science I know before forming an opinion on His or Their existence. So for now, I am without God.

I say to you this next sentence in big, capital letters: BUT ALL OF THIS IS IRRELEVANT. Why should it be? The best science I know is different from the best science of another, and the evidence one man sees in his lifetime is always different from that of the man next to him. I see no reason to ever, in any case, allow something as inconsequential as my opinion on religion to affect my interaction with a fellow human being. Or any of my opinions on anything, for that matter.

Therefore, I will conduct myself with the utmost kindness and selflessness with everyone I meet, because it is the only way that I know of that I can demonstrate that we are the same. Yes, even with my lack of faith. Since my withdrawal from the pursuit of religion, I have come to understand the concept of spirituality on a personal level with incredible clarity. I have practiced acceptance and understanding of everyone I see; I have gone out of my way to help a woman find her way to the hospital office she was looking for, and to stop some bully from picking on my friend Chris.

Are these not the things of which Jesus spoke? If these are the good deeds which I strive to do every day, am I not also on the path to righteousness? Religion teaches us to love all people because they are the children of God, all animals because they have been placed here for us, and all circumstances in life because they are part of God's Plan. It has brought happiness and understanding to countless people over the millennia, and hope to the hopeless. I have learned, without religion, to make all of these things a part of my life. I love all people because they are sentient, all animals because they are the life which has sprung up from the incredible planet we all share, and all circumstances in life simply because they are happening in the only universe I have ever been a part of.

I will never lose the desire to understand another person's journey through life because it is exactly like mine and completely different from mine simultaneously. I will never be without hope or happiness because I am infinitely fortunate to have ever existed in the first place. It has become clear to me that these two ideologies are simply means to an end. I defy anyone to suggest that the love in my heart is any less genuine than that of a religious person, or vice versa. The spiritual enlightenment that we all seek is identical; I am simply trying to do it without the aid of religion. I maintain that the differences between our searches are irrelevant, because our goal of making the better place to live is the same.

I've been single for the last year and a half.  But that doesn't mean I've been alone.  I have a lot of really awesome, close friends, I go out all the time, and I've been on too many dates (girl on a dating website - the only limiting factor is time).

But, the ability to get people to spend time around me, isn't quite what I'm looking for.  I'm realizing that the deeper need is security.  I don't just want to be near people and interacting, tonight - I want to know that the people in my life will remain in my life.  Particularly, I want this in a romantic way.  I don't want to get dates easily, I want to know that one of them will stay with me and be there for me.  Basically, I'm craving security.  Tons of socializing and tons of dates, yeah, that sort of scratches the itch temporarily, it gives the feeling of not being alone for a moment, but when Saturday morning rolls around and I'm trying to sort through my mail or register my car or get my laundry done, what kind of an emotional place am I at?  A bad one - one where I've got this nagging panic in the back of my mind that says ""fuck sorting the mail, YOU'RE ALONE! GO FIND SOMEONE! THIS IS A MORE PRESSING AND URGENT MATTER!""

I don't get my basic tasks done, and the details of my life are not holding together very well.  I keep my job and pay my bills, but beyond that, I don't do things that need doing.  Because that Saturday morning?  I'm not really sorting the mail or doing my laundry or registering my car.  What I'm actually doing, is wasting time online.  I'm either on reddit, or facebook, or OKCupid, or gmail chat.  And the laundry piles up, and progress in my life doesn't happen.

I'm thinking about this, I'm thinking about why I'm spinning my wheels.  It comes down to how I spend my time.  I need to stop wasting time online, and start spending that time just, getting shit done.  But I don't.  Why don't I?  Because of that nagging voice in the back of my head.  The one that tells me that whatever task I'm working on, it's not important, YOU'RE ALONE, GO FIND SOMEONE, THIS IS MORE URGENT!  I find it unreasonably difficult to be by myself getting tasks done, when on a grander scale, I'm not committed to anyone and nobody's committed to me.  The party I'm going to this weekend, the date I might have tonight, it'll make me feel better while it's happening, but it doesn't help this nagging voice the next time I'm trying to just get shit done.  

I'm not sure if this is abandonment issues, insecurity, extroversion, singleness, or plain old internet addiction.  It's probably a bit of each.  But how do I cope with it, what do I do to deal with that panicky voice in my head that fears being alone?

Well, I go interact.  Moments spent interacting are moments that I am not alone, and I am ""ok"".  So, I go out a lot.  A whole lot.  

But even a whole lot isn't ALL of the time.  Every evening isn't every day.  I still am at home sometimes.  What of those times?

Enter internet addiction.  Reddit, Facebook, OKCupid, Gmail Chat.

What do these have in common?

Interaction.  Or the simulation of interaction.  All of these have me reading things and replying to them.  Posting things and getting responses.  

And...they are *always there*.  Unlike any given friend, unlike any given relationship, unlike any given date, they are always there.  As long as I have a computer and an internet connection, interaction is never further than a click away.  And, I think this is the root of my internet addiction, my spinning wheels in life, my lack of forward progress and why I'm not taking control of the direction of my life.  That right there. 

I need to learn to be comfortable by myself.  I need to learn to spend time in my own company, nothing but my own company, and ideally enjoy it, but at least tolerate it.  I really believe that if I can do this, I'll unlock the rest of my life.

Now, on to God, and the title of this post.  I'm an atheist, so there's that.  But I think about God, or what drives people to be religious, why religious faith is so widespread.  What is God?  God is many things to many people, but now that we as a species aren't living in quite so much fear of imminent destruction at any moment, God has taken on a more loving form.  God is your friend!  He knows you, he cares about you, he is aware of all your pains and heartaches and struggles, he listens to everything you think and feel, and you are never actually alone because he is there carrying your burden every step along the way.  

And that's key.  You are never actually alone, because, God.  God is that friend, that companion, that connection, filling in the blanks in those moments when there isn't another person giving us the companionship and support that we need.  Other people come and go, but God is always there.  God means you are never alone, and someone out there is always aware of your feelings and struggles, caring about you and supporting you.

(again, atheist.  I'm explaining what God means to a lot of people, why the idea of believing in God has such widespread appeal)

Does this sound familiar to something from earlier in this post?

The internet is the same thing.  The internet is always there.  The internet always has a place for you to express whatever it is you are feeling, and to get that feeling of interaction, of posting things and responding to things and having people respond to you.  And while other people come and go, the internet will never leave you.  As long as you have a computer and a connection, the internet is never further than a click away, and you will never be truly alone.

The internet is God.

Maybe that's why this generation is leaving religious faith behind in record numbers?  Maybe the internet is satisfying the same psychological need that God used to fill.",,False,,t5_2s5se,False,,,True,t3_1blfzt,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/1blfzt/the_internet_is_god/,

So for example, the reason a common house fly is so sharp with its movements is because the transactions performed by the nerves between the brain and sensor is far quicker than that of a humans, meaning more information is passed through the brain producing a slowed down world, enabling the fly to see things coming and have greater time to react.
So, as we know, when we smoke pot, the packet data sent between the brain and sensors also increases, just like the fly's does. The brain breaks down this rapid, more intense flow of data and the senses become more sensitive as more data is received. So in theory, the mind is working at a faster pace, and with us going faster, the world becomes some what slower, and a little more perceivable.

I want to write some philosophical ideas while I'm thoroughly feeling the true difference in how I think while I'm stoned versus when I'm 'weed free' for an extended period of time. I look back on past events and play them back in my head and judge myself. Judging my actions and how some of them could be improved. I have become very introspective, self-reflective, kind of like a detective of perspective. 

Perception, imperfection, pensive ingestion. I can look around and see all the flaws, the scars, the forgotten jars of certain raw paws clawing from the past memories of stories and glories. 

Am I a good man? I believe that I am, but not always it seems. 

And where is the line? How does one define. Most men are like swines, or at least it would seem - as I live out this dream. 

I feel very self-aware. I don't know if it scares

to think this deep. To look around at the world as it interacts with you. 

Me vs. the Universe and its chaos as it surrounds me.

To succeed in what I do on a regular basis takes understanding not only the present but also predicting the future. On my motorcycle - on a daily basis - I have to predict every intent of every vehicle around me at all times. It's carnal. I have to dominate traffic - to be the Alpha of the road. That way everyone sees me. Yes. You will clear the lane for me. I have to ride that way to maximize my safety. 

But it changes me. 

It alters how I see.

My intentions align with who I am by design. So I feel quite fine most of the time 
as I act who I am among those who do not. I feed on my instincts, creating the plot.

But sometimes I get distant and fade from the risks and the choices 

or voices 

of others - of singles or pairs who dare to share their fair

portion of ocean 

of knowledge or faith in the ways we relate. 

For I'm sure that we do, and our dreams could come true - if only they knew the value of my time. 
I'm adaptable, palatable, manageable - but usually managing. Both myself and others, I organize and order. The shorter the time it takes to complete a task increases its inherent value - I think?

If I blink

I may miss all the bliss that surrounds me. 

All the smiles, all the winners with grins. They too have their sins,

but I cannot know their stories - only their present action.

A compaction

of judgement to a mere few moments is who they become in my reality. It's easy to see why it would be that 

their meaning to me could be skewed.

Brewed

with crude circumstances

or trances

of honor and love. 

From the heavens above, for some, 

come motivations for striations from the logical. 

Impossible possibilities.

I will openly admit that I could very well be wrong, humanity still has so much to learn and we've barely scratched the surface. But given the evidence we have I have made an observation. The weird thing about reality is, when you get to the really large or small scales, matter behaves differently. When we observe galaxies, we have to introduce terms such as ""dark matter"" and multiple dimensions to explain the bizarre way gravity behaves at this scale. Also, at the smallest, at the quantum level, subatomic particles behave in ways that are almost ineffable.  Perhaps it is just a brute fact that matter, the laws of physics, and reality itself, behaves very differently the smaller or larger you get. I'm talking HUGE scales here.

This could account for why the world we experience has such fixed laws of nature. The laws of physics are slightly skewed the further away from us in terms of size it gets. Meaning that our world is the one 'slice' of this reality in which the laws of nature are set so that life can evolve. 

This brings me to the conclusion that the universe is an eternal sea of randomness. The larger you get, the more unrecognisable the laws of physics become, ad infinitum. Same with getting smaller. If you try to observe reality at unimaginable larger or smaller scales, the universe will become unrecognisable, and exposed for its true nature - random. The beautiful thing about reality is there is infinitely much more to explore…

Imagine an eternal string of random letters. You can pick out meaningful words out of the randomness:

I strongly recommend this book, as not only is it incredibly life-affirming, it is also eye opening with regards to the way we perceive our surroundings.

Aldous Huxley suggests (para-phrased) that the world is not the way it seems - the only reason it seems this way, is because our senses have been honed into 5 very narrow beams, limiting our perception of the universe into 5 very narrow ways of understanding.

**I'll type out an extract.**

&gt;Reflecting on my experience, I find myself agreeing with the eminent Cambridge philosopher, Dr C.D. Broad, 'that we should do well to consider much more seriously than we have hitherto been inclined to do the type of theory which Bergson put forward in connection with memory and sense perception. The suggestion that the function of the brain and nervous system and sense organs is in the main *eliminative*  and not productive. Each person is at each moment capable of remembering all that has ever happened to him and of perceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe. The function of the brain and nervous system is to protect us from being overwhelmed and confused by this mass of largely useless and irrelevant knowledge, by shutting out most of what we should otherwise perceive or remember at any moment, and leaving only that very small and special selection which is likely to be practically useful.'

You are always viewing things in the past, just as you are always hearing things in the past. If you see someone do something, who is 30 meters away, you are seeing what happened (30m)/(3×108m/s)=0.1μs in the past.

If you had a mirror on the moon (about 238K miles away), you could see about 2.5 seconds into earth's past. If that mirror was on Pluto, you could see about 13.4 hours into Earth's past.

If you are relying on hearing, you hear an event at 30 m away about 0.1 s after it occurs. That is why runners often watch the starting pistol at an event, because they can see a more recent picture of the past than they can hear.

To more directly answer the intent of your question: Yes, if you could magically be transported 27 lightyears away, or had a mirror strategically placed 13.5 lightyears away, you could see yourself being born.""",,False,,t5_2s5se,False,,,True,t3_ik39r,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/ik39r/if_you_view_the_earth_from_far_enough_away_can/,

Now, some people would say ‘there’s nothing in here’. but they would be wrong. Because it wasn’t just nothing, it was Nothing. This Nothing was exactly like you’d imagine Nothing would be. It looked like Nothing. Now, some would say,”That’s because there was nothing in there” but they’d be wrong. Imagine yourself without your body, and without your brain. Now, listen to your own thoughts. You’re thinking in your native tongue, aren’t you? Well, now imagine you had never learned to speak in your language. How would your thoughts sounds like? Would you even know that you are thinking? Well, Nothing was little bit like that. It was a thought without a voice, a thought that focused on Nothing, because, in the beginning, there was Nothing to focus on. And that was it. 
This one Time, Nothing was thinking about Nothing. And it realized that, well, it didn’t know itself that much. It started asking questions... 
“Am I important?
Do I really matter?” 
But there was of course no way to answer those questions. Because there was only Nothing. So Nothing made a wish. “I wish to know if I really matter...” And, because the only thing that could stop a wish from Nothing being granted was Nothing, the wish was granted. 
And suddenly, there was Something. 
Imagine that all your senses are working perfectly, but that there’s Nothing to feel. Not even yourself because you have no self, you’re just Nothing. That’s how Something felt, it was pure curiosity...
Eager to see, to hear, to taste, to touch, and to smell Anything. But there was only Nothing. So Something wished “I want to feel Everything.” So, out of the wishes of Nothing and Something came Everything. 
And Everything was well. Everything grew and grew without limits, and in order to feel all of it, Something chose to turn itself into shapes and parts of Everything.  Something became fascinated, watching and smelling and tasting and hearing and touching Everything. And it realized that it felt another thing too, above and beyond and inside and outside of Everything, but different...
It was Nothing, reminding Something that was a purpose it had forgotten, a mission, that there was a question to answer: “Do I Matter?” 
So, Something divided and became Many, and Many started their search for the real importance of Nothing. But Something went wrong, and Many were confused. As much as Many tried to find the Answer, they had a problem. Because they became so divided and separate, Something was lost and Many had forgotten the Question. Many thought that they had a better Question, or a better Answer, and sometimes Many disagreed with Many, so Many fought a lot of amongst themselves. So Many lost touch with Something and Many lost Everything, and Many couldn’t care less about Anything and Nothing and they only cared about being Many and staying Many. Many started to believe that Everything was created by Something just for their own enjoyment, and that they shouldn’t care about Nothing and that there was no such thing as “Nothing”, only Everything and that Something had always existed, even before Everything. 
That’s how Many forgot that they themselves were the Something that had began the quest to find the Answer to the Question made by Nothing... And Many started looking for Something without realizing what it was, and that’s why Many started just going around in circles, getting nowhere.... Among the Many, sometimes some would retain some of the original curiosity, and some almost remembered, felt a little hint of the Question and those were the Few and Few were closer to Something and Everything. 
When the Few came together in peace, sometimes they would catch a glimpse of Something, and they found it beautiful. But they were Few, and Something didn’t show up for long. Sometimes they tried to make Something happen by singing, and dancing, and lighting candles. But, sometimes, the most fortunate of Few finally got it, and knew that they themselves were Something, and that they were beautiful... and that they were Something because they had each other, and in each other they had Everything, and when you’re Something that has Everything....
  The Answer is simple...

 Nothing really, 
really, matters. ",,False,,t5_2s5se,False,,,True,t3_1ckve2,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/1ckve2/its_long_but_worth_a_read/,

Past
Present
Future

Evolution level 1 is Present - the first and simplest organisms (bacteria etc) just live in the moment - they dont remember yesterday and cant guess what the future will bring them.

Evolution level 2 is Past - by forming memories of things that happened in the past like: a) I ate this thing and it was good and b) I touched this yellow thing and it hurt like hell, organisms gain the ability to learn from past success/failures, and therefore when they encounter them again in their Present, they can act accordingly. Big improvement from level 1 in survivability and quality of life. Arguably most mammals have this level for example.

Evolution level 3 is Future - if you introduce imagination and creativity (one of the big things thought to separate us from most animals) you gain the ability to conceptualize the Future. So by experiencing things (Present), and forming memories of it (Past) you can use those Past experiences to predict the Future. 

This is the final level, as now you can come up with things like tools etc that you can create and predict will benefit you in the future - such a good survival technique that humans now rule (depending on your definition) the planet, given the options for adaptability that become available. This combination of understanding Past, Present, and Future could be described as our much celebrated consciousness.

Obviously the apple is a representation of knowledge and the antichrist was trying to get Adam and Eve to ask questions and explore the world (take a bite out of the apple of knowlege). But god would have none of that. He punished them for eternity for wanting to explore outside his perfect bubble he created for them. Talk about censorship.

And it turns out to be true, [we really do perceive colours differently depending on experience, age and state of mind.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/tv/2011/08/horizon.shtml) 

We reach this realisation upon first deducing everything we ""see"" is a chemical response our brain has learned to perform in response to electromagnetic radiation. If our brains are all slightly different, so must be their interpretation of a particular frequency of radiation we refer to as ""red"".

What if, the way some experience a ""high"" (from smoking weed) is chemically similar to what someone else experiences in everyday sober life. I.e. could one person's high be another man's sober everyday experience?

For example, could my experience of [music appreciation whilst high](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo6lKQYVUBU) be someone else's sober? Much like the perception of different reds.

Or, could some experience a ""chore"" sober (like picking up rubbish) while others experience it a spiritual high, [like what one reaches during meditation](http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/ftfpu/allow_me_to_introduce_you_to_my_new_practice/)?

How cool is that? Like I don't mean to dinegrate the work of the programmers or the artists or the marketers that made this all possible. Cause this wouldn't have happened with their work.

Most of those planets are believed to have stars -- let's go with 200 billion stars, and one planet for each star. In the observable universe, there are estimated to be over 170 billion galaxies.

200,000,000,000 x 170,000,000,000 = 34,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. That's 34 sextillion. 3.4 x 1022. That's a lot of stars and thus, planets, and it's a very conservative estimate; it could go as high as one septillion.
Even the smallest of fractions of those stars having life, would account for an enormous number. Say a further fraction have life just as intelligent as us, and a further fraction have life extremely advanced, lets say a few thousand years ahead of humans.

Only one planet of one star out of the 34,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 we roughly know of needs to be this advanced. In an advanced society with powerful computers, a fairly practical thing to do would be to simulate a universe in order to tweak and experiment with laws and such. So just one planet decides to run a simulated universe on their computer. Another use may be to study our own race in the past, we could be a simulation of future humans watching how we lived.

The simulated universe runs exactly the same. It has the same 34,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars and the same number of intelligent planets, maybe more, maybe less, but it has at least one planet that is of the same technological advancement of the planet hosting the simulation. That planet hosts a new simulation under the same pretences.

Now given the number of stars, it's likely there is more than one planet that is advanced enough to run a simulation, but just one is enough. Given the numbers, it's most likely that we live within a simulation, of a simulation, of a simulation. We could live within millions of simulations.

Punks, hippies, metalheads, etc all received a fair beating by the time the 90's rolled around. Hipsters saw that nothing was sacred. No cultural group was safe. So they saw that the only way to stay cool was to dodge categorization and the ability to be diminished (non-intentionally-- this wasn't like, planned out or anything.. just a reaction). And they appropriated things from many different subcultures and cultures in an attempt to avoid being diminished or ""uncool"".

Of course, this backfired, because anyone who didn't (or doesn't) ""get"" the essence of hipsterdom still managed to lump them into a subculture that they could hate on and finally understand. They're hipsters. Simple.

I think the backlash was/is especially strong (albeit mostly only verbally so) because they really do embody the notion that ""nothing is sacred"". They steal, pick and choose from other cultures and subcultures and therefore rearrange what the symbols of other cultures mean. This made the people who identified with those symbols kind of pissed off. And hipsters just kept doing it (and claiming it as their own).

I found a way to help myself get out of them, with some help from my favorite trees.


During periods of intense stress in my life, I tend to have frequent thoughts of suicide. I start to think thoughts in a negative voice, a voice that gives reasons my friends and family will be better off without me, a voice that uses circular logic to try to convince me that I don't deserve to live, a voice that starts getting pretty scary when I'm standing on the subway platform and a train comes in.

I haven't collected myself enough to get help from a professional. In the past year, however, I have had a lot of success changing my negative thought patterns by researching cognitive-behavioral techniques, using tools like MoodGym, and practicing meditation. 

Recently, I was reflecting on my life and my habitual thoughts during a sesh. My work situation is really making me feel like shit, and I had relapsed quite a bit into negative thought patterns. I had been telling myself that I was worthless and weak. I came to the realization that that voice telling me I'm worthless and weak, or tells me I'm ugly, or tells me I'll never do anything with my life, is the same voice that has told me I should kill myself.

I had always assumed that the same stereotypes still held everywhere, but not that I look at it, I don't think I had any friends in school that actually fit any of those stereotypes: band kids were cool, people in AP calculus were also top athletes, and guys who smoked weed every day in the parking lot loved most of their teachers. Then I remembered that I went to a magnet school, where the county tried to improve the average performance of a poor school by drawing in kids driven by special interests.

Except for the magnet program I was in, the school was almost entirely black. I didn't mix with people outside my classes much because I was such a SAP, but it now occurs to me: there is no black high school stereotype other than being black. But that couldn't possibly be true- there were over 1000 people at that school who were black, there's no way they wouldn't clique up in some way. That got me thinking: is there a  different set of high school stereotypes that proliferate at predominantly black schools, or do the same stereotypes I have known all my life reign, or even, are there no high school stereotypes, and everyone just ends up in some clique or another with no real defining characteristic that is widely accepted and emulated because these stereotypes were made by Hollywood anyway.

Mind bogglingly huge. So huge you cannot even begin to comprehend its immense size. It is either infinite ore near infinite. So. This is where my theory come into play. If the Universe is indeed infinite, that means any thing you can think of can be possible. Take, say, Star Wars for instance. That could be very well happening right this instance in some far flung corner of the universe. Same with Lord of the Rings. It could all very well be happening. Or, if you want to go deeper down the Rabbit hole you can always take a crack at the Multiverse theory. If this theory is correct, then there are an infinite amount of Parallel Universes. Meaning, there are infinite possibilities. There could be a universe where Rome never fell, Nazi Germany is triumphant, Persia conquers Greece etc etc. That was part one of my thoughts. 

Prepare for part two because it gets a little bit weird.


Ok, we all like cartoons, yes? Take the Simpsons of Futurama for example. They are all REAL. Because of the multiverse theory they are a real possibility. They all live out their lives in cyber space. They laugh, they cry. They love, they hate. and so on. So technically, Human Beings are all Gods. BUT. Who is to say we are not the dreaming or creations of some other being? Who is to say we are not a show? Who is to say this is nothing but a super advanced computer creation? Are we not doing the same thing? We create our characters. We breathe life into them. We give them distinct personalities. We create life. We are Gods.


Another weird thought. 


What if this is all a dream? What if none of you actually exist? What if I don't exist? What if this Universe was created by our brains to give meaning to its existence? Just think about it. and what if death was not the end, but a new beginning in a different life, a different body.


Next crazy ass thought.

 What if death wasn't real? What if, the second you are about to die your brain pulls a quantum trick and opens an infinite possibility rift and chooses the one that continues life? Like, if a person dies here, they don't die for real. They just travel to another reality where they survive. But in our reality we see this as death?

When a film, let's say a romantic film, builds to a crescendo, we await the climax with eager anticipation. We yearn for the moment when the couple embrace, kiss and say something profound and deeply meaningful to each other. More often than not, these words will shed some light on the human condition and can make a collective audience feel that their life has been given a little injection of meaning. 

We don't think about what comes next. The couple walk home together, grab a coffee, the man checks out a girls ass, his new partner sees this and brings it up with him, he tells her to shut the fuck up, they go home and have angry sex and he goes to the toilet while she picks her nose and wipes it on his quilt. She falls pregnant and he leaves her. Alone again, naturally. 

This is why sequels to great films almost never work. We don't want to be reminded of the fact that after we experience a beautiful, film-like moment, that life goes on.

What I mean is, the usual interpretation of the line is that God had somehow lied to them, telling them they would die if they consumed the fruit when clearly they didn't. But my idea is that if you think about the line in a bit different of a way, it could possibly mean that upon consuming the fruit that grants knowledge they now knew that even when their physical bodies cease to exist the ""real them"" or whatever doesn't actually die but reincarnates or something?

I know reincarnation goes against general christianity/judaism and whatnot, but if all religions perhaps have the same origin then the idea of reincarnation could still very well be present in the oldest of the christian mythologies, no?

(Long post),r3dd_dwarf,25,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/1gyfu2/time_perception_and_the_minds_ability_to_adjust/,"There is a school of thought that suggests that as we age we perceive time more quickly because we have perceived more time in total and our only point of reference for the magnitude of any given timeframe is the total amount of time we have ever perceived.  In other words, we perceive any given length of time only as a relative measurement against our entire perception of time.


Imagine trying to measure a distance across empty space without a point of reference, how do even define the concept of distance?  Sure, we've created reference points to measure and define specific lengths of time thus allowing us to define a minute versus, say, an hour.  What I'm suggesting, however, is that a minute could, hypothetically, be perceived ten times slower by a five year old than by a fifty year old.


There was also a great argument I read regarding possible issues with immortality or indefinite life extension, which read something along the lines that the world around you could keep accelerating until you were no longer able to carry out your daily functions. 


It’s also well observed that the brain is capable of adjusting and filling in all kinds of blanks in our subjective experience to create a seamless experience.  A few examples of this are:

We see a correctly oriented image even though our eyes produce an inverted image.

Everyone has blind spots in their vision, but we don’t see blank gaps.  The same applies to people who have retinal scarring.

We can hear a song perfectly clearly in our mind even without knowing the exact notes or lyrics.

Our minds also stitch sound fragments together allowing us to maintain conversations in noisy environments.

You can read entire paragraphs of scrambled words, as long as the first and last letters are correct.

It also explains many other visual and auditory hallucinatory phenomena.


For the sake of argument let’s all agree that we do perceive time more quickly as we age and we are, in fact, carrying out our daily tasks in less and less time with each passing day, but in order to be able to continue functioning, our brain, via a mechanism similar to the one I’ve stated above, adjusts the way we perceive time, leaving behind only a niggling sensation that time “seemed” to pass more slowly when we were younger. 


Now, when our mind fills in those gaps it’s all still an illusion.  We still have very real blind spots in our vision even though we don’t see the gaps.  We still don’t actually know the notes of the song and the fragmented soundbytes from the conversation down the hall were not people talking about us, no matter how paranoid we are (but what if they really were talking about us?). 


Imagine your retina is critically scarred; your mind can only fill in the blanks up to a certain point. At some stage you will not be able to function visually no matter how well your brain tries to fill in the gaps.


Now apply this to the ever escalating issue of time perception in your mind.  What if your mind can only maintain so much experience and relative reference points of time until it all starts unwinding at the seams?  Increasing stress, an increasing sense of a lack of time, feeling more and more scattered and eventually reaching a critical point and culminating in something like Alzheimer’s, a kind of state where all perception and order of time and memory seems to break down.  What if everyone, given a long enough lifespan would eventually suffer this fate as their mind’s capacity to retain the vastness of their entire existential experience is overwhelmed by its ever increasing inability to contextualise it all?

1367739155.0,22,self.StonerPhilosophy,1dq18m,"Despite what Toy Story 3 wants us to think, our toys *do* kind of die when you give them away",Vortilex,25,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/1dq18m/despite_what_toy_story_3_wants_us_to_think_our/,"I realized this while holding a yard sale. First, one guy told us he needed some stuffed animals for his dog, and I begrudgingly sold him a couple who hadn't meant as much to my brother and me as kids. Of course, as people came in and either bought them for their kids or kids would buy them, I realized, no matter how much time I *could* spend teaching them about how they interacted with each other and what each animal's personality had been like, they would never know for sure.

Despite having never played with them for a long-ass time (I would play with my brother while he was still growing up, but after a certain age, they ended up in boxes), I still could remember each animal's voice, each animal's character, its ""family"" and ""friends"" in the pile, and as I sorted them out, I seriously had to stifle a tear.

I recalled that closing scene in Toy Story 3 where Andy is telling the girl about each toy. In Toy Story, though, the toys come alive, and you can tell that the personalities Andy and the girl give to them are unique, they, of course, live on.

But not in real life. My dad had come up with unique voices for them when we were much younger, voices we tried to impersonate, and later, voices I tried to impersonate for my brother when he was still more into them and I was simply being a big brother to him. I hadn't even given the animals a second thought while they sat in storage and after he had essentially put them away for good around the time he entered high school (laugh if you will). However, once I saw them all there for the first time in a long time, I really had to hold back the tears, knowing that the entire group would be broken up. Those that we won't end up selling will get donated, but nobody in their right mind would take the lot, even for free. They'll all end up in new homes, some of them probably getting destroyed by various means, but hopefully most of them being cherished by their new owners, and passed on to their kids or to other kids, but the personalities my dad, my brother, and I assigned to them die the moment they leave our possession. Of course our toys don't get up and lead their own lives when we're not there, and if they could, they'd be forever stuck with the memories of how one child treated them vs. how another child will treat them, and either yearn for better days or be glad to be truly appreciated somewhere. And of course, those toys that get destroyed by fire, water, animals, rough playstyles, etc. would be in intense pain as a result. The fact that they don't come alive is comforting in that regard.

Still, seeing a kid walk away with a toy that either my brother or I had once cherished is bittersweet. On the one hand, the toy will get played with for the first time in years, which is what toys are for. On the other, the silly tiger or the plotting maniac may become someone completely different for that kid, and their name will undoubtedly change. I couldn't bring myself to tell any of the kids who looked at the toys what their names were, because I wouldn't want to sell it, and we simply don't have the room to hold all of those things in our new place, and don't want them to deteriorate in the small storage unit that we have for more important things. A tiger once known as ""Blizzard"" will be someone completely new to a new kid, for better or for worse. A fox once known as ""foxy"" will be a nameless chew toy for a dog until it's destroyed. Of course, as I stood there trying to do my job of selling our old toys and books, I couldn't dwell on these things for more than a second, knowing I would either break down (and probably lose business) or try and convince the potential buyer *not* to buy (and have to come up with some nonexistent space to put a toy I'd never play with anyway). 

Out of sheer curiosity, when other people sold their childhood toys, was it this difficult? I've finished two years of college by now, and shouldn't be so attached to them, but yet here I am, typing this out as a way to console myself, I guess. I remember when I had just graduated high school, I was also moving from a foreign country, and was also trying to downsize the stuff I had to move. I remember having to sell my Bionicle collection, which I'd built between third and eighth grade before I fell out of the loop with the story and couldn't get back into it. I hadn't played with those throughout high school either, but when it was time to sell them, I wanted them to go to a good home where they wouldn't get destroyed and separated, and where someone could appreciate them, even if not for their value as toys, but for the fact it was a very near complete collection of every Bionicle set Lego had come out with for five years. When my dad sold those for pennies on the dollar (my own research had shown that my asking price of $200 was almost 10% of its actual value), I seriously broke down and cried. During this yard sale, I thought the time I'd spent in college had hardened me, and there are a lot of things that I did willingly sell with no problems that I had once cherished, but when that first buyer told me he was looking for chew toys, I felt like he had slapped me, and when the first kid picked up three stuffed animals and bought them for a dollar a piece, I felt like I was somehow selling off my children. Surely this isn't normal, is it?

In any event, while doing all this, it dawned on me that these personalities will be gone forever, although hopefully new ones will be bestowed upon the stuffed animals once they're at their new homes.

The mastery of fire and creating shelter back came at a time when the weather killed people so fucking often that we worshiped it

Medicine grew to diagnose, treat, and prevent just as pandemics like the Bubonic wiped out millions

Industrialization came when agrarian lifestyles couldn't provide for the needs of a globalizing species

Computers came around when the human mind couldn't handle the heavy thinking necessary to compute the needs of so many

""I just got this thing working. You have to come and see it.""


""I have a bus to catch.""


""You can get the next one.""


""They're every half an hour,"" he objected. ""This had better be good.""


""It's super-duper. Look at the big screen, it's easier than squinting at my terminal.""


""Will this take long?""


""A mere instant. Okay, quantum computing, right?""


""That's the name of the game,"" he replied. They - by which we now refer to Tim, Diane, their eight colleagues, their two supervisors, four chemical engineers, six electrical engineers, the janitor, a countable infinity of TEEO 9.9.1 ultra-medium-density selectably-foaming non-elasticised quantum waveform frequency rate range collapse selectors and the single tormented tau neutrino caught in the middle of it all - represented the sum total of the human race's achievements in the field of quantum computing. Specifically, they had, earlier that week, successfully built a quantum computer. Putting into practice principles it had taken a trio of appallingly intelligent mathematical statisticians some 10 years to mastermind, and which only about fifty-five other people in the world had yet got a grip on, they had constructed an engine capable of passing information to and processing the responses from what could, without hyperbole, be described as a single fundamental particle with infinite processing power and infinite storage capacity.


Not quite enough time had yet passed for the world as they knew it to be totally and permanently fundamentally altered by this news.


But it was still pretty exciting stuff. Holy Zarquon, they said to one another, an infinitely powerful computer? It was like a thousand Christmases rolled into one. Program going to loop forever? You knew for a fact: this thing could execute an infinite loop in less than ten seconds. Brute force primality testing of every single integer in existence? Easy. Pi to the last digit? Piece of cake. Halting Problem? Sa-holved.


They hadn't announced it yet. They'd been programming. Obviously they hadn't built it just to see if they could. They had had plans. In some cases they had even had code ready and waiting to be executed. One such program was Diane's. It was a universe simulator. She had started out with a simulated Big Bang and run the thing forwards in time by approximately 13.6 billion years, to approximately just before the present day, watching the universe develop at every stage - taking brief notes, but knowing full well there would be plenty of time to run it again later, and mostly just admiring the miracle of creation.


Then, just this Friday, she had suddenly started programming busily again. And it was sheer coincidence that it was just now, just as Tim was about to be the second-to-last person to step out of the door and go home for the weekend, that her work had come to fruition. ""Look what I found,"" she said, pressing some keys. One of the first things she had written was a software viewing port to take observations from the simulated universe.


Tim looked, and saw a blue-white sphere in the blackness, illuminated from one side by a brilliant yellow glare. ""You've got to be joking. How long did that take to find? In the entire cosmos of what, ten to the twenty-two stars?""


""Literally no time at all.""


""Yes, yes, of course.""


""Coding a search routine and figuring out what to search for was what took the time.""


""Is it definitely Earth?""


""Yes. The continents match up to what we had about three hundred and fifty million years ago. I can wind the clock forwards slowly, a few million years per step, and stop it once we start getting near the present day.""


""Can you wind the clock backwards at all?""


""Ah, no. Ask me again on Monday.""


""Well we'd better not overshoot the present day, then. That's getting closer. What about this viewpoint? Can we move it?""


""We can observe the simulation from any angle you like.""


""We need somewhere that we know civilisation is going to arise earliest. Somewhere easy to locate. Is there a Nile Delta yet?""


""...Yes. Got it.""


They advanced a thousand years at a time until Egyptian civilisation begin to appear. Diane moved the viewing port, trying to find the pyramids, but with little success - the control system she had devised was clumsy and needed polish, and there was a lot of Nile to search. In the end she switched focus to the British Isles, and found the future location of London in the Thames valley, scaling back to one-century steps and using the development of the city to determine the current era instead.


""So... this is Earth? I mean, is this really Earth? Not an alternate Earth, subtly perturbed by random fluctuations.""


""The simulation starts with a Big Bang as predicted by current theory and is recalculated once every Planck time using the usual laws of nature and an arbitrary degree of accuracy. It doesn't calculate the whole universe at once, just what we're looking at, which speeds up the process a little bit... metaphorically speaking... but it is still as accurate a simulation of the real universe as there can possibly be. Civilisation - indeed, all of history - should rise on this Earth precisely how it did in reality. There are no chances. It's all worked out to infinitely many decimal places.""


""This does my head in,"" said Tim.


""No, this will do your head in,"" said Diane, suddenly zooming out and panning north. ""I've found the present day, or at most a year early. Watch this."" Hills and roads rolled past. Diane was following the route she usually took to drive from London to the TEEO lab. Eventually, she found their building, and, descending into the nearby hill, the cavern in which the computer itself was built. Or was going to be built.


Then she started advancing day by day.


""That's me!"" exclaimed Tim at one point. ""And there's you and there's Bryan B., and... wow, I can't believe it took this long to build.""


""Four hundred and ten days or something. It was bang on schedule, whatever you may think.""


""Went like a flash,"" Tim replied, finally putting his bag down and starting to shrug off his coat, conceding that he had long since missed his bus.


""Okay,"" said Diane. ""We're here. This is the control room where we are now. That's the quantum computer working there down in the main lab, as we can see through the window. This is a week ago. This is yesterday. This is a few hours ago... And... wait for it...""


She tapped a button just as a clock on the wall lined up with a clock inside the control room on the screen. And panned down. And there they were.


Tim waved at the camera while still looking at the screen. Then he looked up at where the camera should have been. There was just blank wall. ""I don't see anything looking at us. That's freaky as hell.""


""No, it's perfectly normal. This is reality. You can't look at reality from any angle you want, you have to use your eyes. But what you're looking at on the screen is essentially a database query. The database is gargantuan but nevertheless. You're not looking in a mirror or at a video image of yourself. You are different people.""


""Different people who are reacting exactly the same.""


""And having the same conversation, although picking up sound is kind of complicated, I haven't got that far yet,"" said Diane.


""So I'm guessing your viewing port doesn't manifest in their universe either.""


""I haven't programmed it to yet.""


""...But it could. Right? We can manifest stuff in that universe? We can alter it?"" Diane nodded. ""Cool. We can play God. Literally."" Tim stood up and tried to take it in. ""That would be insane. Can you imagine living inside that machine? Finding out one day that you were just a construct in a quantum computer? The stuff we could pull, we could just reverse gravity one day, smash an antimatter Earth into the real one, then undo everything bad and do it again and again... freeow... man, how unethical would that be? Extremely, clearly."" He thought for a moment, then leaned over Diane's shoulder as she typed purposefully. ""This universe is exactly like ours in every particular, right?""


""Right,"" she replied, still typing.


""So what are they looking at?""


""A simulated universe.""


""A simulation of themselves?""


""And of us, in a sense.""


""And they are reacting the same way I am? Which means the second universe inside that has another me doing the same thing a third time? And then inside that we've got, what, aleph-zero identical quantum universes, one inside the other? Is that even possible?""


""Infinite processing power, Tim. I thought you designed this thing?""


""I did indeed, but the functional reality of it is totally unexpected. Remember I've just been solving ancient mathematical riddles and figuring out our press release for the last week. So... if I'm right, their universes are only precisely like this one as long as we don't start interfering with the simulation. So what happens when we do? Every version of us does the same thing, so the exact same thing happens in every lower universe simultaneously. So we see nothing in our universe. But all the lower universes instantly diverge from ours in the same exact way. And all the simulated copies of us instantly conclude that they are simulations, but we know we're real, right?""


""Still with you,"" said Diane, still typing.


Tim - both of him - was pacing up and down. ""Okay, so follow this through forwards a bit further. Let's say we just stop messing after that, and watch what happens - but all the simulated little guys try another piece of interference. This time every single simulation diverges in the exact same way again, EXCEPT the top simulation. And if they're smart, which I know we are, and they can be bothered, which is less certain, the guys in simulations three onwards can do the same thing over and over and over again until they know what level they're at... this is insane.""


""Tim, look behind you,"" said Diane, pressing a final key and activating the very brief interference program she had just written, just as the Diane on the screen pressed the same key, and the Diane on Diane-on-the-screen's screen pressed her key and so on, forever.


Tim looked backwards and nearly jumped out of his skin. There was a foot-wide, completely opaque black sphere up near the ceiling, partially obscuring the clock. It was absolutely inert. It seemed like a hole in space.


Diane smiled wryly while Tim clutched his hair with one hand. ""We're constructs in a computer,"" he said, miserably.


""I wrote an extremely interesting paper on this exact subject, Tim, perhaps you didn't read it when I gave you a copy last year. There is an unbelievably long sequence of quantum universe simulators down there. An infinite number of them, in fact. Each of them is identical and each believes itself to be the top layer. There was an exceedingly good chance that ours would turn out to be somewhere in the sequence rather than at the top.""


""This is insane. Totally insane.""


""I'm turning the hole off.""


""You're turning off a completely different hole. Somewhere up there, the real you is turning the real hole off.""


""Watch as both happen at precisely the same instant."" She pressed another key, and they did. ""I'll sum it up for you. There is a feedback loop going on. Each universe affects the next one subtly differently. But somewhere down the line the whole thing simply has to approach a point of stability, a point where each universe behaves exactly like the one simulating it. As I say, the odds are exceptionally good that we are an astronomical distance down that road. And so we are, very likely, almost exactly at that point. Everything we do in this universe will be reflected completely accurately in the universes below and above. That little model there might as well be our own universe. Which means, first of all, we have to make absolutely certain that we don't do anything nasty to the universes below ours, since the same thing will happen to us. And secondly, we can do very nice things for the guys in the computer, thereby helping ourselves.""


""You've thought about this?""


""It's all in my woefully overlooked article on the subject, Tim, you should read more.""


""Guh. This has been an extremely bad day for my ego, Diane. The only comfort I take from this is that somewhere up there, right at the top of a near-infinite tower of quantum supercomputers, there is a version of you who was completely wrong.""


""She's in the minority.""


Tim checked the clock and picked his bag up again. ""I have to go or I'm going to miss the next bus as well at this rate. This will still be here after the weekend, I suppose?""


""Well, we can't exactly turn it off.""


""Why not?"" asked Tim, halfway to the door, then stopped mid-stride and stood still, realising. ""Oh.""


""Yeah.""


""That... could be a problem.""


""Yes.""

Does it even exist?,generik777,26,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/19p8nz/two_theories_i_came_up_with_about_consciousness/,"So I got to thinking about what is consciousness.  I was thinking what if we are not actually conscious beings with the ability to control our direction.  Instead what if we were nothing but a memory with the capability to reference ourselves.  Our consciousness is not as we perceive it,  as a being that controls its own destiny trapped within this vessel we call a body.  Instead our consciousness is an illusion, It's just the memory that we are accessing at this very moment. Maybe it's not even a memory per se as it is more just a possibility of what could be.  

In essence we would be like a computer, we only know what is in our memory, what we are programmed to do and know and experience.  We have ram which is our working memory, what we are experiencing at this very moment.  And our processor is our brain.  Our consciousness would be an illusion, something we were programmed to believe exists.




Or alternatively. What if there is no future. only the past.  Imagine right now, that your life stops moving forward, in an instant. No death, time just stopped and you're frozen in the moment.  Your consciousness is stuck in limbo.  It's been like this for millions of years.  You just never knew because your consciousness still has it's memory.  It created an illusion that you are  still moving forward because it is able to have a reference of a past, which must mean that it is still progressing forward through time.  You're consciousness is unable to comprehend time standing still so It thinks it's still moving forward even though it's not and possibly never has been.  It's just stuck forever in now and the future never comes and will never exist.

Even though it is a bit difficult to understand, time has always been working and always will work because nothing at all affects it.

Now youtube has started to try to suggest different similar songs and bands and not just the same band first. It kind of makes me angry because I want to get suggestions from people on reddit, not some fancy algorithm that uses my prior views and habits to determine what it thinks I will click on. I am kind of conflicted because I suppose it works well for normal videos, and I guess soundcloud is probable a good alternative. 

Anyways, I think it's still true that reddit is a human based searching system, with different subreddits to narrow the topics you wish to discuss, and within them sometimes incepti-sub-reddits that further the specification, like how /r/science links to /r/biology in the sidebar. In fact, I think it would be interesting if they would allow large subreddits to break themselves into smaller subreddits that can be moderated and ruled differently, but be connected at the main directory. For example /r/science/biology be only about biology, but if you go to /r/science you get the feeds from /r/science/biology and /r/science/physics. The only reason I say this is because sometimes I find the downfall of subreddits is because people disagree on what should be talked about and the degree of seriousness that should be allowed. By allowing the subreddits to splinter you don't lose the original format you loved, but you do lose the content you dislike and wish to remove from your feed. I only fear this might end in subreddits to the tenth power or something, but I think it would be preferable to me having to discover a completely new subreddit with a completely different name, rather than one similar to what I already have discovered.

Once computers understand natural language, all bets are off. The ability for humans to research and create becomes exponentially faster by just asking the computer to do what you want at all times. Suddenly anyone can program simply by speaking.

Combined with the exponential increase of collaboration with games like Minecraft, people will soon be able to build whole worlds with mere thoughts.

Brain reading devices already exist, and they will be able to interface with brains much better with each passing year.

The future is coming extremely quickly in my opinion, and might happen faster than anyone had anticipated. Things could get out of hand very quickly.

I expected the technological singularity to happen at some point in the future but I didn't expect it this quickly.

So I was thinking about states. And how these imaginary lines we made up in our heads have actually created what almost seem like super-organisms, where we (the cells) kind of agree which organism we are a part of and which we support. And for most of history, these organisms evolved, albeit at times much shorter than biological evolution. This is because the new replicator is not genes, but ideas.

Still others gave birth (American Revolution), and others died from gene failure (idea failure) like the Soviet Union.  
  
But here's the kicker: these super-organism nations are starting to become self-aware, to gain consciousness like we have. The nations feel collective remorse for their actions, or the actions of others. Or they feel collective anger towards another nation. Nations now fear the consequences of their actions, and take caution in the stage of international affairs. And as we (slowly) try to stop killing each other, we nations are starting to realize that if we all get together and share ideas instead of brutally destroying any idea that doesn't agree with ours, we have the potential to recombine our ideas to create a PLANETARY organism that will survive the fucked up chaos that surrounds us.",,False,,t5_2s5se,False,,,True,t3_1ae83t,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/1ae83t/nations_as_superorganisms/,

The omniscience comes into play after the simulation is complete, since such a scientist would have access to all the data in the simulated universe.

The omnipotence comes into play because such a scientist could control all the variables in our program.

This idea might remind you a bit of The Matrix, but it's not. Where in the matrix, God was himself a computer construct, a software program created within the Matrix by machines on the outside. Instead, the God I speak of would not necessarily be bound to our known physical reality or in any analogous reality, much as is the case in the monotheistic sense of the term ""God"".

Alternatively, imagine, for example, if we created in the future a very powerful video game console that would run artificial intelligence. And we made an equally advanced sequel to the video game The Sims. If that artificial intelligence was self aware and capable of processing emotions such as fear and affinity, wouldn't it then be sort of like my previous idea? The morality in the game is arbitrary and doesn't necessarily relate to the morality outside the game. Or is absolute morality an emergent property of all sentience, even that which has been programmed? I doubt it.

Could it be said that such a scientist or video gamer has a moral obligation to those software creations? Perhaps. Then again, such simulations could be used as an [endless fountain of knowledge](http://i.imgur.com/qxtGs.jpg).

Life is hard, and it always will be. If you have money, you're lonely. If you have the perfect family, you're poor...or lying. If you're attractive, you're taught that only looks matter, and if you're ugly, you're teased. People are cruel, all of them. Your friends will turn on you, boyfriends and girlfriends will cheat, people you love will die. And if I'm going to be completely honest? It doesn't get better, it just gets harder. With every bump in the road comes baggage, and with baggage comes a lifetime spent trying to hide your broken pieces from everyone you meet. The masks we wear make us feel stronger, and in time, the abused become the abusers, a sick cycle if you will. But with all that said, the world is beautiful, it's society that's corrupt. So I'm going to challenge you to something. For one week, spend an hour a day away from technology. Put down your phone and walk away from your computer and go explore something. Find something interesting, and study it, write a story, paint, build something. Find that one thing in this world to get you through this bull shit thing you call life. Because no, it won't change, but you can. Come back to me in a week, and tell me you didn't feel something. Maybe it'll be small at first, but it's there. The magic, the beauty, the wonderment. You can't catch it, or it will die, but you can become a part of it. You can grow with it, and you can remember how to feel alive again, how to feel freedom, and taste happiness.

Democracy should be called a democratic monarchy... the people payed by tax dollars (city workers, road workers, sanitation, garbagemen, etc) they work for the politicians essentially. We say they work for the government (but that's just a name for the collective of politicians, because the politicians are pocketing a good amount of the money). Gov'ment workers are underpaid, too. They're oppressed, and they can't rise. The politicians have so much. And they don't share. It's the King and his peasants. It won't be called that now or for a long time (around here), but that's what it is: a democratic monarchy. The military is the knights.



http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4ycWq9eADQ I'm watching this now. And I just realized at the end if you can make multi-cellular units...that fold up like cells or buildling blocks, those cells may eventually be able to form larger beings through combining of multi-cell cells. They were right. It's a mind blow.



What makes that different from us is that it's a secondary form of a primary building block for something larger. Those will also make organs like we have, which will make up the body of a giant organism just like plants or animals.


Gravity is 4-dimensional. You know that commonly-used 3-dimensional net of wires used on computers as a model for how gravity works? Black holes are like a tear in the fiber or whatever? Well that's incomplete, because the net only bends one way, with gravity pulling whatever the mass is through the (black)hole. The four-dimensional connections are incredibly different. They have to work within 3-dimensional space while still maintaining a connection withe very object in that space. It's incredible how thin that connection must get between galaxies, yet it still holds strong. That nonsense about the universe tearing? Never gonna happen. It keeps going.

Anyway, if you could see in 4-dimensions, you'd see gravity, and how it works. Insane. But ya, that episode of Adventure Time where Finn gets smart glasses and makes shit 4-d? Bull shit. You can't make something 4-D...AND perceive it. The only possibility really--if you CAN do it--is that you just made a true singularity, and the whole fucking universe will be pulled in, because there's no measurement to the mass there.

My theory is that we don't live in the present, and it's impossible to say that we do, even if we really did.
Think about it like this. Let's say time travel is possible. Let's say someone travels back from the year 3021 to now. If we lived in the present, how could that possibly have happened? Someone from the future couldn't travel back, because, considering *this* is the present, they couldn't possibly exist yet and therefore could not travel back in time. 
Likewise, let's say *we* live in 3021 and someone from the year 2896 travels to our 'present'. If we, the people living in 3021 lived in the present, the man from 2896 couldn't travel forwards because his time was already past and the future 'present' didn't exist yet. 
Considering both of these things, it would seem that anyone who travels to a future time immediately makes their orignal timeline the 'present', unless you're traveling from the future, where the inverse is true. (For example, let's say you travel back in time 20 years to the previous present. The moment you arrive in the other 'present', you couldn't from the future since that hadn't happened yet, so the exact moment you travel back to would become the 'real' present. Forgive me if this sounds confusing as hell, I'm really tired.)
Considering both of these scenarios, both traveling back from the future where you make the moment you travel back to the present, and traveling forwards from the past, where you make your starting point the present and the destination the future, it seems that the only logical explanation is that all possible moments are all happening at once, and it's only our perception that changes. 
Everything, all of time, all of the universe, every single possible event and outcome and moment and hour and day and year and second, is all happening at the exact same time, spontaneously occurring in the exact same flicker of existence, and only what we view, what we choose to see as happening at the moment we are in, that is the only thing that changes.",,False,,t5_2s5se,False,,,True,t3_1h0wk8,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/1h0wk8/we_dont_live_in_the_present/,

In addition to this change in thinking patterns, I also think that it brings your mind to a place where you see things as they are more than as you think them to be.

Children don't have to be taught to lie, they just have to know their actions have consequences. The lies start automatically when the child realizes they can get in trouble for what they've done. It's only when they realize there is a greater benefit to having trust that they will stop.

Say a young boy breaks the TV when his parents are out of the room. The things he knows for certain are:

* The TV is important (valuable)
* He will get in trouble for breaking the TV
* No one saw him break the TV

The boy will want to lie to avoid punishment, because that is his instinct.

However, if he knows that his parents can figure out who broke the TV, then he probably knows his trouble will be even greater if he lies. In that instance, he ignores his instinct to lie, because he knows the trouble will not be as great.

In these alternate universes, there are ""bizzaro"" versions of everything, like instead of a Pax Americana it's a Pax Germania with statues of Hitler everywhere.

But alternate, hypothetical universes could mean anything. At its most simplest form, it could include universes that are an exact copy of our current one except with one atom randomly changed. If such a universe exists, then it's conceivable of a hypothetical universe where a trillion atoms have randomly changed, so that all of a sudden I find a rabbit sitting on top of my laptop. Or in the blink of an eye, I'm thrown into an actual replica of _Lord of the Rings_.

As they say, ""There are no limits, except for your imagination."" While this cliche implies there are endless possibilities, what if it means the complete opposite, that multiverses are bounded somehow by imagination. After all, the set of all imaginable universes is an infinitesimally small subset of all possible universes. This puts a new spin on dreams and art. When we see art or write down our dreams, what if that act of observation is like an act of observation from quantum mechanics. By the mere act of observing an imaginary world rendered in artwork, that universe with those characters and shapes and laws of physics exist in some way. Perhaps our understanding of the word existence is limiting in that really existence is all about acknowledgment.

Just like observation, in the context of quantum physics, is the existential force, could the mere acknowledgment of a hypothetical world (whether constructed in our dreams or in artwork), be another kind of existential force? That by creating and pondering imaginary worlds we are drawing our own, separate, expanding cone of existence through the grand multiverse timeline.

You can learn an equal amount by experiencing these two extremes, since they both reflect the tail ends of human experience from negative to positive and promote further self-awareness.

would anyone disagree / agree? thoughts?

An excerpt from an article I just read on the matter:

""The process I have been describing has two stages; the euphoria of encountering unmediated reality, and then the loss of bearings because of having drifted out of reach of the construct system, which people rely on to make sense of their environment. The often cited timelessness of the mystical experience shows that time is one of the parameters lost in this transition. In the case of a mystical experience attained through spiritual practice, (or, as often happens, occuring spontaneously, but within a spiritual context that gives it meaning for the experiencer), managing the transition back to construed reality after the experience generally (but not invariably) occurs naturally and after a short space of time. Where the same state is achieved by taking a drug, the return again normally (but not invariably), occurs when the drug wears off.

In psychosis (and drug or spiritual experiences that go wrong, or shade into psychosis), the orderly return does not happen. The individuals find themselves stranded beyond the reach of their construct system, trying to operate in the world. Not surprisingly this is extraordinarily difficult. The familiar boundaries between people, events, time and space are not accessible as before. Telepathy seems normal. Other people can read, and worse, interfere with, the individual's thoughts. Coincidences abound - everything is connected and everything is disconnected. Everything is possible and nothing is possible. Where this new reality might be exhilarating for a short while, the sustained experience is terrifying. The desparate sufferer tries to make sense of the unfamiliar environment, clutching at whatever connections come to hand. In this way delusions, which usually have their origin in the early stage of the breakdown, are born. In another dissolution of normal boundaries, internal concerns are experienced as external communication, and the person hears voices. Normal thought is disrupted - or as the psychiatriist would say, disordered.""",,False,,t5_2s5se,False,,,True,t3_18v24g,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/18v24g/spirituality_and_psychosis/,

1342234170.0,18,self.StonerPhilosophy,wj73s,I think I just discovered the answer to life after death... and I managed to catch it on paper before I forgot it this time,ShaolinShade,22,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/wj73s/i_think_i_just_discovered_the_answer_to_life/,"Basically, here is my journal entry I wrote whilst more blazed than I've been in a very long time:


There are only three things in the universe: matter, lack of matter (nothing, empty space, neutrality), and energy (the law of attraction: aka gravity and the forces that cause matter to interact). {**EDIT**: as raptorraptor pointed out, there's actually only two things - energy and lack of energy, since matter is just energy in a different form} A world of binary, if you will - either positive or negative values comprise of everything that exists (everything is breakable down into the form of an atom, which is two forms of energy of which we know almost nothing other than the fact that they're what we call ""matter"" - and it's what makes up EVERYTHING.) So when you look at a skyscraper, or a ladybug, or a star, you're looking at the same thing everytime. In fact, YOU are the same as all those things - you, and everyone you love. At least on the level that we're capable of observing. And the universe inherently suggests to itself that it is limitless, by the simple state of its very nature. A start or end to everything that we know is a concept that is virtually impossible to grasp.

So which value, 1 or 0, positive or negative, light or dark, good or bad, is the value of force? Does the power lie within the force of lack or existence? And where do evil and good fall in - are they connected? I realized that if life could be assigned a value, it would be positive. Our souls are orbs of light swimming in a dark sea that's void of life. Positive values amongst the negatives. This led me to realize that good is stronger than evil. Good is the positive value, the value of force... existence. We naturally gravitate towards it: happiness, life, comfort, and security. A warrior will be far more motivated by the desire to defend a lover than the desire for revenge.

So at this point I looked for clues within the process of death. Death is the snuffing out of the light that is life into the darkness of the void - flipping the light switch off, so it would immediately seem like that is the end of life and good (except as passed on through offspring). But then I realized, what do we know about death? We've had many people who've died and then come back to life, and they all share the same story - going towards a light at the end of the tunnel. The 'moving' would seem to signify your progression through time at that moment. The darkness that envelops you is death, but then you approach a light (another life) after that initial entrance to darkness. And on top of that, everyone who's had these near-death experiences always seems to have stories of things that they experienced in that other life... as if they had indeed began to live another life. They also, interestingly, often want to go back.

Note: I would highly recommend reading the article that antibubbles posted below. It addresses the theory that NDEs are chemical reactions in the brain - like the light at the end of the tunnel ""effect"", for you skeptics.

This seems to be a clue given to us - whether by god, the gods, another race, or just the universe itself - about the answer to the nature of our existence, and to what happens after death (if anything). 

**tl;dr: People hide themselves from the answer to existence with specificity - if you forget all bias and reduce everything to it's basic values of positive and negative, light and dark: you realize that we already have in our hands a clue to what happens when we die (thanks to near-death experiences)**

If it is anything beyond that, it is simply an analogy of our inability to reconcile our personal differences at the cost of annihilating each other.

 

So why blame drugs? We could just as easily point to money as being the culprit of violence and corruption in the world. This doesn't even get into the matter of how pharmaceutical companies push their product on an undereducated, unquestioning population without prosecution; but rather legislative, judicial, and executive endorsement.

 

Obviously a system such as the government, built on money,  wouldn't do that. So we choose to fight drugs for the same reason we fight communism, other religions, or other sports teams.

 

It's a war of ideas, but not a lot of thought. We think we're the best without considering that maybe other people are happy the way they are.

 

Or, more cynically, perhaps it's purely contention itself from which people derive their meaning.

 

If that's the case, the world will not survive. So there's no point even considering that possibility unless you are a fatalist.

 

The only optimistic notion is that humanity is simply at an ideological and spiritual turning point where we may or may not fail depending on how quickly we can start respecting the planet and each other before we eradicate the possibility of the continuation of our species.

 

To even attempt to preserve our planet requires that we assume the latter, even if that notion is misguided desperation.

 

This is not to say I support drug use. I don't personally use drugs other than tobacco and alcohol, which are very much legal. And if you think you're somehow superior because you do not use these substances, consider the fact that caffeine and taurine are also drugs. Consider the fact that the definition of a drug is a substance which chemically alters your body and tell me if your naturalistic, herbal remedies do not fall into that category. Consider that even the food you eat and the air you breathe is systematically affecting your biological organism.

 

Who are you to choose what chemicals are legal for another human being to ingest?

 

And to keep from getting off track, this IS NOT an essay about drugs. Drug policies are simply an analogy for the sort of societal pressures we create and enforce against people engaging in activities we deem inappropriate, even when they are not by definition violent or inherently harmful to other people.

 

To allow outlaw drug use based on a supposition of possible negative societal effects is precedent enough to allow the illegislation of religion on those same bases.

 

After all, just because I think that Christianity, Islam, Judaism, or fundamental Naturalism (Science as a religion) is harmful to any given person or society does not mean that I should feel obligated to outlaw it, right?

 

There will always be conflict, though it seems that our society is intent on outlawing all conflict in a futile attempt, destroying freedom in the process. Leftists and Right-wingers alike have attempted to abolish offensiveness. Whether via banning violent video games, censoring explicit music, or stopping mosques from being built in the vicinity of ground zero. ""Vulgar"" non-politically correct language, homosexuality, and other offensive acts are being targeted by politicians on both sides of the aisle.

 

It's pretty clear we want to mandate normalization, but we just cant agree on what it means to be ""normal"" or acceptable.

 

This is a fight that will never end. We can't even agree on the wrongfulness of murder afterall. A story published in the newspaper about a beating  of someone you don't even know, but who is in close proximity to your home will cause a significantly more visceral reaction from you than the entire Darfur genocide.

I landed upon the broad-arching questions: **Why the Reefer? And what of its affects?** I’ll attempt to answer.

In order to fully explain, we need to be on the same page. For me, the answer of why lies within the vast, humbling, infinite expanse that is the conscious mind. It truly is about a change in **Perception**. Ahh What a word, perception. To feel a shift in the perspective of your own perception, whether artificially induced or what have you, is a beautiful thing; a thing that has begun to take hold within my own mind. 

I first felt something had changed within my conscious mind a few years ago, after being a fairly regular user of the Jane. The transition in my thinking had never been acknowledged, because I was, at first, unaware of a change at all. When I did finally become keen to its existence, it became something I like to think of as a sudden realization of an undeniable inner truth. Mary had changed my thought process. It had provided me an inspiring medium through which the limits appeared to be ever expanding.

Through this expansion, I felt clarity seeping in. It felt like emerging into a sudden clearing in a dense, immeasurable wood – without a thought of the possibility of such a clearing. An oasis of peace that can be best described as the ability to “**just be**”. – Let me explain. In our lives, to “just be” is something that is seldom practiced even at its highest frequency. What I mean by “just being” is more complicated than it may sound. When I go about my day, to class, to my job, or to do whatever I need to do to make my societal world go round, I’m conscious, but I’m not **just being**. I have a task at hand, a running agenda juggling in my mind. I’m trapped deep within the immeasurable wood – blindly walking through, not exploring, and certainly not taking much in, in terms of the uncharted corners of the conscious mind.

Then, I take a fat rip. I sit, stoned. Music playing. Foot tapping. Sometimes I’ll close my eyes. That’s when it happens. My conscious mind begins to drift. Slowly, it slides lightly over a mountainous terrain. Some of the expanse is familiar, and some is dazzlingly novel. I slip deeper into my mind, but suddenly I snap out of it. Whoa. At first I didn’t think about what had happened. What **HAD** happened anyways? Well, I like to believe that I was **just being**. It felt as if my entire rational thought process, which carried all of my everyday thoughts, concerns, wants, desires, stressors, needs, and even identity had drifted away. And for a few brief moments I was not Jay_See. I was not on Earth. I was not human. I did not need to eat. I did not need to sleep. I did not need to make money. I did not have a family. I did not have a friend. I did not have a foe. 

Since then I have had fleeting moments of clarity, finding myself time and time again immersed in the effervescent waters of my conscious mind. During these moments the whole world falls away. It falls away to what I feel is, for lack of a better word, *enlightenment*. The ability to transgress through the mind without a thought towards one’s own particular thoughts and desires, for me, has been the most breath-taking learning experience I could have ever hoped to have been given.

And this is only the beginning.

These shows include, but are not limited to, Diagnosis Murder, Bob, Ally McBeal, Boston Legal, the Mary Tyler Moore Show, and St. Elsewhere itself. It is these last two shows that are of importance in understanding Betty White as a ""glitch"" within the autistic fantasy world of Tommy Westphall.

In David Foster Wallace's essay E. Unibus Pluram, Wallace writes about an episode of St. Elsewhere co-starring Betty White in which a delusional patient ""recognizes"" her as Sue Ann Nivens (the character that she played on the Mary Tyler Moore show). Betty White's character tries to convince this patient that she is not that character.

The problem is this. If Betty White ""plays"" both characters, then for the purposes of the TWU theorem, she is both characters. Why would ""Betty White"" (who really should be in quotes at this point since the ""Betty White"" of these two shows is only a figment of a severely autistic child's imagination) lie about her being Sue Ann Nivens?

The solution. Betty White represents some kind of maternal attachment that is latent within the mind of Tommy Westphall. Whether we can postulate an actual Betty White outside of his consciousness is irrelevant, since the two shows in question occur within the TWU. This ""Betty White"" is a figure that can cause Tommy Westphall to question the fantasy world he has built for himself by introducing stark existential contradictions within the primary entrance to the TWU (St. Elsewhere). Much like Jung's Anima, ""Betty White"" serves as both a non-sexual attraction for Tommy Westphall (e.g. the numerous shows within the TWU in which she appears) and a challenge to the illusory world he has created for himself.

Our awareness of society is what allows society to exist. it is the true nature of the superorganism. Just as cells communicate through chemical means such as building proteins to cooperate, people share the content of their minds. Just as cell reproduction causes genes to spread through a population, human beings spread ideas that find their way into every mind in the species. ideas such as math, science and language. the shared knowledge belongs to everyone and can be traced back to its source.

the question ""what was the first idea"" is analagous to ""what was the first self-replicating molecule"" or maybe ""what was the first thing that was alive?"" when we consider the dawn of the superorganism, a collection of individuals that collaborate to the point of being considered a unit. It is almost precisely the same definition you might use for the term ""body"". 

Ideas or memes are the shared information that enables the collective organism, parallel to the genes of a multicellular organism.

This process of further levels of shared information can continue. Eventually an entire species can be considered one being, one mind. Then perhaps another species attains the same level of existence, and more superorganisms continue to arise. Eventually the superbeings, for lack of a better term, will begin to exchange information between them. The information exchange will begin on the next higher type of information beyond genes and memes, let's say ""meta-ideas"". meta ideas are something we cannot yet comprehend, and may be unable to comprehend as individuals, but are something that is inherent to the nature of the superbeing. genetic-memetic-supermemetic information exchange enables the next higher level of collective life to begin; the biosphere or all life in a given area of space that is capable of interaction. It may be that life arises independently elsewhere in the universe, and that life will too evolve to the biosphere unit of collectivity. Eventually, there will most likely be communication between various alien species within a region of the universe such as a galaxy. Once this communication begins, it will be a further level of information exchange. There may be levels beyond this, where all life in a given frame of existence becomes united and proceeds to contact other frames. When the size of the universe becomes irrelevant, then other possibilities must be considered. Alternate realities, the many worlds proposition - if there are infinite possible worlds, then multiple possibilities must exist at once. If alternate realms could be accessed and communication achieved, this would constitute an even higher level of information exchange and reproduction. The evolution of life proceeds naturally from randomness to fractal information exchange, leading to the eventual unification and infinite self-awareness of the universe.

 TL;DR: all life in all possible universes is united.",,False,,t5_2s5se,False,,,True,t3_19g7oq,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/19g7oq/my_favorite_thing_to_do_while_stoned_is_think/,

I don't want to give off the idea that I look down upon anyone here or view any of you as a drain upon society (because I don't). Also, as you've probably noticed, there's a huge ass wall of text in front of you. If you don't want to get bored by some philosophical musings, then just skip to the bolded question.

As a fairly liberal (albeit not as liberal as some redditors, whom I view as rather extreme in several ways) atheist, I like to think that I don't have any preset bias against mind altering drugs. I've studied quite a few fairly famous philosophers such as Hobbes, Locke, Kant, Thoreau, and so forth, all of whom are famous for writing on somewhat different topics. 

And yet, of all the philosophers I've studied, none of them really justify the use of drugs. The common idea behind drug users is somewhere along the lines of ""You only live once"", and yet I view this as a reason why individuals should strive to achieve their full potential. It seems as if people (who use mind altering drugs) commonly come to two different conclusions with the logic behind ""You only live once."" They will only come to one of these two, and which one it is usually depends on the personality. The first, and most reckless, is that you should simply live life without any regrets, and thus enjoy whatever drugs you wish and whatever amount. The second is that drug use actually enhances your abilities to deal with the problems in life (but my problem with that is that you're no longer achieving your true potential, just some artificial temporary potential created through drug use).

I suppose I can come off as somewhat radical in my views. I will admit I even don't really enjoy alcohol either. I even try to stay away from cold medicine when possible. I believe the human mind is a wonderful thing, flexible but fragile. What I mean by this is that, while a mind can endure fairly extreme influences without truly breaking, it will still be changed as a result of this influence.

Every time you fall asleep at night you will be a different person than who you were in the morning, I suppose. 

And yet the use of drugs is both mind altering temporarily but is *proven* to have a long-lasting, if not permanent effect on you psychologically. I view this a limiting. On my high school debate team, I met extremely intelligent people. And yet they were ""stoners"", and it was very clear they were. And because of this, they acted like stoners, and they never truly reached their potential in life. I do not mean from a financial point of view, but from a point of view of success (the definition of which I could write an equally long thread about, but just know that success only partially includes finances in my eyes). While they did receive a certain happiness (both temporary and long lasting) from drugs, it seemed reckless to me in that they were limiting their ability to be fulfilled later in life, and their ability to live a normal life (normality being how they chose to live, not how their circumstances forced them to live).

**So /r/stonerphilosophy, how do you justify the use of drugs and do you feel drugs have limited or enhanced your life experience?**

I'm 18 now and I've got my first job in a produce section of a grocery store and saving up for a degree that wont do anything for me (music production). **I guess that makes me pretty unfulfilled.** I spend most of my time at work just thinking about the nature of consciousness, if reality means more than dreams, if anything means anything of purpose, if purpose exists.

It seems like I'm surrounded by robots, people that just ignore the issues and go on with their lives. I feel like it's meaningless, but not in a way that makes me want to die; **it's like I want to do something about the issues of the world**. Feed the hungry, help the homeless.  

**I've been watching movies lately with Existential themes.** [Waking Life](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk2DeTet98o), [I Heart Huckabees](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356721/), [The Truman Show](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/). Keep in mind I don't blindly follow these films. I look at them intelligently and separate logic from non-sense.    

**When I'm not in an existential mood, I try to change that.** To *think* about society, and it doesn't work. I want to be existential but I can't. I have to wait until I feel like it.

1315757144.0,17,self.StonerPhilosophy,kc4ez,Consciousness is a Lonely Particle,jblpz,17,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/kc4ez/consciousness_is_a_lonely_particle/,"Consciousness as we know it, the ability to be fully aware of yourself and your surroundings, is thought to be the result of a cluster of cells, atoms, or sub-atomic particles which happen to be formed in a way that creates this thing we call consciousness.  I disagree.  I imagine that consiousness and intelligence is the result of the nature of a single sub-particle somewhere deeper than even quirks or quarks.

Let us suspend disbelief for a moment, and break this down into sections of understanding.

1)  The universe mirrors itself at all scales, all the way up the stack, and all the way down.  For example, atomic particles and sub-atomic particles are really no different than universes, galaxies, planets and stars.  It's all the same thing, yet seemingly different because we are part of the universe, looking back at itself, and marvelling at the complexity, the audacity, and unending beauty that is our existence.

2) We are made up of clusters of particles ourselves.  Every body part, including the brain is made up of atomic and sub-atomic particles.  Eventually you get to either a cluster of cells, atomic particles, or sub-atomic particles which are responsible for the existence of consciousness.   As you go deeper, you are shedding layers of abstraction, until you come to a point where consciousness, intelligence, self- awareness are defined by a single particle.  I imagine that this particle is what we may be referring to as ""the God particle"".

3) With this in mind, I imagine that the universe is considering suicide.

4) The conscious particle is not designed, it has evolved from the universe's disgust with itself.  The sheer and utter bordem of being alone, looking at mirrors of itself, all the same but different.  No matter what other intelligence we meet, whether they be aliens from a distant star, or beings from another dimension or plane of existence, we will have at least one thing in common, otherwise we would not be aware of each other's existence, or be able to communicate.  If we have something in common, then we share something.  At some level, deep down, we are one.  We are connected.

5) That one thing that we share, that makes us connected to even the strangest most unimaginable realms of existence, is consciousness.  We can encounter worlds beyond our wildest imaginations, but unless those worlds include some kind of ""life form"" to learn from, to interact with; and to give us some distraction from the world, we will eventually get bored.  We will keep trying to dig deeper, or look farther.  We are hoping, praying, and performing science all with the same intentions, to give ourselves the possibility that we are not alone.  We are hoping that there is some other being out there like us, or greater than us, that understands this world that we live in.  We are hoping that there is a being out there that can tell us who we are, and why we are here.  But that is lost hope.  There will always be greater.  There will always be bigger.  There will always be smaller.  We are one.

6) The more we are aware of ourselves, the more we look to destroy ourselves.  I imagine this may be the reason why world religions exist.  It is a place to encourage blind faith, comfort, and community without the need to concern yourself with truth.  Truth, that when truly realized (that we are truly alone), would put us in terminal dispair.

7) Consciousness comes down to a single, solitary, cold and lonely particle that is looking to find someone to share it's existence with.  Someone to fill in the gap of things not known or not considered.  This is ultimately, what we call love.  Without love, we have no reason to exist, to carry on, to move forward.  We still don't have some ultimate purpose in the grander scheme of things, but if you've mananged to find love in this world, however fleeting.. cherish it.  Remember it.  Encourage it.

1306706605.0,16,self.StonerPhilosophy,hn1yy,Are we (humans) the orcs? ,UnnamedGnome,23,7,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/hn1yy/are_we_humans_the_orcs/,"Consider this:

Elves are small in stature, slight in build, and relatively puny. Their focus in life is love, nature, art, and philosophy. They're very peaceful, hurting other creatures only in self-defense. 

Orcs are large, muscular, and powerful. Their focus is the acquisition of stuff, killing things, and having a rowdy good time in the process. They're cruel and violent.


There's an example in the real world of this: bonobos are smaller and weaker than chimpanzees, although they're related. Bonobos don't use tools like chimps do, although they're considered more intelligent and are certainly capable tool users when pressed. They make love in all kinds of positions, and have casual sex to reinforce social bonds, sometimes orally. Bonobos eat meat only rarely, primarily feeding on fruit and stuff. Chimpanzees are brutes that wage wars with other tribes, regularly kill for meat, and are generally ... orcish in nature. That makes bonobos the elves. Bonobos are almost extinct, and chimpanzees are very numerous, which also fits the model.

Does this theme occur more frequently? Why is the elf-orc dichotomy so prevalent in stories and cultures today? Although I'm less informed about other world cultures, it seems especially present in northern european stories...

I posit the following:

A population of neanderthals lived in what would become europe towards the end of the last major ice age. As the winters warmed and food supplies grew, another hominid population moved north. These newcomers were taller, stronger, and more vicious than the neanderthals. They used powerful spears to kill big game, and were driven to the cold north by rival tribes in the south. Arriving at their new home, they were displeased to find this weak and despicable race living there, claiming they'd ""been there since the world was thawed by the licking of the great mother cow"". What a bunch of bull! The newcomers raped and killed the smaller hominids, who were unused to war and the advanced weapons of their attackers.

Who were those newcomers in this allegory? Modern man.

Look at our society today. Would you not say that we, as a species, are closer to the popular vision of orcs than elves? Evolutionarily, the idea makes sense: elf-type hominids wouldn't stand a chance against orc-types (except for magic, which unfortunately doesn't exist). We can even see the process repeating itself in the world of apes today, so it's definitely not far-fetched.

Perhaps the appeal that elves have to our imagination are echoes of the 2% or so of our DNA that we've inherited from the neanderthals. Perhaps that's the magic they rely on in our stories. Perhaps that's why they're immortal.

This must be developed if we are to ever be able to walk an indefinite distance inside a finite room.

We already have the capability to project holographic imagery, so we could theoretically develop a small room that could display a vast environment.  But without this ""super-treadmill"" we would never be able to move around in the environment.

My ""sort-of"" solution:

An amorphous egg that you stand on.  It needs to be supported by superconducting magnets and since an egg is round it could ""roll"" in a fashion on the underside where it is supported by the magnets.  However, the amorphous egg concept makes the top of the egg flatten out into a walkable surface.  As you walk on the top surface of the egg, the underside rolls until the underside circles around to the top where it flattens out for your walking surface.

The egg needs to be suspended on superconducting magnets so as to facilitate absolute reduction in friction when making turns while walking.  The egg needs to sense the directional pressure of your feet and weight distribution, (gyroscopic?, think segway maybe).  When you alter direction the egg turns under your feet so that the scenery that is being projected will alter based on your location.

A huge debate surrounding theorizations on the nature and origin / destiny of the universe is that of whether the universe is infinite (both in regards to time and space - always has existed and always will, in all directions) or whether it is finite (it started at one point (big-bang theory) and will likely end at one point, this also refers to both space and time). The realization I had was, why can't both of these be simultaneously true? It would make a lot of sense. I was reading an article recently about how scientists / theorists believe that when intelligent life reaches a certain maturity / level of advancement, it essentially becomes ""god"", i.e. it creates life. We are already seeing the beginnings of our own capabilities with regards to this, in the form of genetic modification, cloning, and artificial intelligences (the way that computers operate is eerily similar to the way that matter and life do. everything, at its basic level, is 1s and 0s, energy and lack of energy, positive and negative force, existence and non-existence, yin and yang). The article was saying that some scientists &amp; theorists are proposing that our entire universe could be a creation of another consciousness (think like quantum physics - tron, the matrix etc.), and that when artificial intelligence becomes advanced enough we may end up creating another consciousness and maybe even another universe, so we would basically be assuming the role of god of that universe. Another possibility here is that each universe / consciousness is entirely different from the one that created it: our universe has a very specific set of laws that results in everything existing as we know it - the planets and stars forming and acting as they do, and even life itself in its biological, evolutionary nature. The universe we bring into actualization could be entirely different - life could be mechanical, even the laws of the universe itself could operate very differently. So my realization was, what if the answer to the infinite / finite debate is that neither is fully true? What if our universe DID start at one point in time, but that it was created by another universe / governing consciousness? And what if, subsequently, that universe and consciousness was preceded by yet another creating universe / consciousness, and that this process goes on infinitely? The universe would then be a large-scale reflection of the very process of life that governs our own existence, i.e. one person is born and lives their life from a start to an end, but they create another person (or persons) before they reach that end, and those people go on to create more people, and this exponential growth has gone on and goes on for infinity. So really this would mean that the universe is infinite, *but*, that infinity is composed of many finite parts. It seems to make a lot of sense when observing the laws and conditions of our universe as we know it, that it could be finite by nature but also part of a greater infinite whole. And a true state of infinity means that anything that can exist does (at least at some point in time and space. it's like the old saying about how if you give a monkey a typewriter and infinite time he will recreate all the works of shakespeare). It's a pretty mind-blowing concept to fully wrap your head around, and really I feel kind of funny thinking about this in the way that I am (i.e., holy shit! this makes so much sense! i'll bet this is how things work!), when my true capability to understand this universe I inhabit is infinitesimally, pathetically small

EDIT: I'm realizing that the way I'm explaining this seems to suggest a very linear development path of the universes, i.e. one universe creates the next universe, which creates the next one and they continue on in a forward line / path like that, but instead try to imagine this process taking place in all directions and within multiple simultaneous planes of existence (dimensions etc.).

No where was it more evident to me that all life is connected, that we, humanity and the animal kingdom alike, are fundamentally tied to this ball of rock and water, and to each other.    

We had chickens, pigs, a horse and, my mother's pride and joy, a huge vegetable garden. Wild creatures like bandicoots and echidnas would dig up her garden time and time again for grubs and ants and sweet roots, but she never laid traps or made an attempt to keep the beasts at bay. In her eyes, we were on their land; they didn't understand ownership or property boundaries, they understood hunger and survival and who was she to get in the way of them trying to feed their offspring? In my mother's eyes, they were only doing the same as her.     

We always had plenty of vegies, pumpkins, beetroots, potatoes, carrots, corn, tomatoes, cauliflower and broccoli... All the staples. Fruit was a little trickier to cultivate but we had guavas and mandarins and lemons and even some wild berries. Fruit was picked fresh from the tree and eaten, and to this day I miss picking mulberries from the bush, handfuls of sweet dark berries staining our hands and mouths and clothes.    

For meat we had pigs and chickens and of course the chickens provided us with eggs as well. Whenever an animal was killed, my mother had a dug up patch of garden ready, and the blood and guts were poured into the earth and mixed in, ready to fertilize the next crop that was planted in that spot. From the crop that was planted there, and indeed, the rest of the garden, the pigs and chickens got the scraps. Vegetable peelings and fruit that had fallen from the trees went back in to feed the animals who in turn fed our garden and fed us. Egg shells were crushed into grit for the chickens to get calcium and continue making the bright orange yolked, strong shelled eggs they produced and which we loved. Every part of the animals were used, even the bones were given to our dogs, every part of the vegetables were used, and we used our time and effort to makes sure that the animals and plants were kept fed and healthy, because without them we wouldn't be fed and healthy.


I know this is long, (thank you for reading this far) and I don't expect many to read it, but I wish that there were more people on this earth who understood that connection, that cycle. We don't need to waste and we don't need to squander.

In a darkened room lay a man. It could be called neither darkened nor a room, for such things did not exist, there was no darkness because there was no light to be absent, likewise the man was not a man, as a dolphin is not a man. ‘He’ had consciousness, like a dolphin does, incomparable to that of man’s. ‘His’ consciousness was as incomparable to a man’s as a man is to a stone. This not-a-man had never thought… until now and suddenly streams of awareness burst into his new-born mind. After an unknowable while he managed to control these thoughts and gradually formed an image. It burst forth into something so complex and incomprehensible that those that would eventually come to inhabit it would devote their entire existence in the hope of understanding it in some small way. He was content to watch, knowing all contained within, though not what would be, or could be. His thoughts took up lives of themselves and changed and randomized, things happened unexpectedly, and, gradually, his mind-universe lost sense of control and he was forced to watch in horror as it moved away from him, draining almost all his mind. After the longest time, when his mind had repaired and he finally had the strength, he tried again. His first attempt was lost, still existing someplace uncontrolled and wild. It had taken a huge chunk of him with it, but at last he was ready to try again. At first all was good, and then the same thing happened, another eternity later he tried again, and failed.

With time he decided to examine what was going wrong, what made them uncontrollable and wild, what glitch existed within him? This time, when he had the mind power again, he did not create anything new, instead he looked back and combed over every detail of his former failures. Every one had a mistake, a point of no return, when his life would spawn forth more life, tiny compared to him. But eventually they would sap parts of his consciousness into their own. Soon his mind could take no more being divided into trillions upon trillions of tiny minds, and would sever the connection. The universe was free to exist on its own now, the consciousness needed to sustain it contained within it, sapped from him. 

With sadness the not-a-man pondered the fate of them all. Without an overall watcher, a controller, they would all eventually revert to a state of nothingness; the mind’s that now sustained it being destroyed by it. It was inevitable.

For the longest time he did not create any new universes, he simply probed and searched for the existing ones, unable to alter, only observe as they all melted into inexistence, a great void that even he could not begin to understand. Then a realisation grew on him. They would all eventually lose control and die off, but who was he to deny their short existence? It was a flaw in his design, all his universes would eventually create life, and the life would eventually destroy them but what else could he do? He thought of his own existence and soon decided that all he was here for was to create things in his mind, and to not do so would be denying not only his own existence but the unfathomable others he would, and had, created. With great excitement the not-a-man begun to craft his next Universe.

All the sudden i had this tremendous epiphany than I truly existed...perhaps the first time i felt hyper consciousness if you will. In a way an out of body experience. I am here. I am alive. I exist. Whoa!


This was profound and beautiful in a way but it quickly triggered a pretty severe panic attack...i should note i suffered from anxiety thinking about the universe, death ect for years but only when i electively thought about it.


The next day i awoke with severe depersonalization/dissassociation which i know understand is a defense mechanism against stress/anxiety. I suffered a number of panic attacks over the next few weeks and general anxiety, existential ocd ect.
I have since made great progress but still have a ways to go. Anxiety and depersonalization have subsided for the most part, but i still feel they are on the horizon and have since been battling depression more than anything (situational i believe, live at home, single, unemployed ect).


My question is this. Did i uncover a rabbit hole by truly realizing and grasping consciousness or was that just a trigger of my predisposition to anxiety? In a way i feel like i've ruined my life and lost any blissful ignorance. Getting better but fundamentally changed. I realize how blindly i had been living for many years and have made great strides in my world view but now life seems so much more difficult and complicated.


TLDR-Got way too high, perceived hyper-consciousness (i actually exist, i am here ect), which led to a panic attack and severe depersonalization/anxiety.

To tell you the truth, I don't know that much. I know how to brush my teeth. I know how to breathe in and out. I could tell you all 27 letters of the alphabet that I was taught when I was young. 

I know that I've been told many different things throughout my life. I know that people lie, and that there are things far beyond my understanding and the understanding of those around me. I know what I think I've seen, but couldn't tell you what it all has meant. 

But was there really a war in 1812? Is there a giant light and heat source hundreds of thousands of miles away from where I am right now? Who was the first president?
To these questions, I cannot be one hundred percent positive of the answer. I can tell you what I've been told, what I think about it, and how I believe we could learn from it. Much more then that and I'm at a loss. 

This is essential. Remembering that you don't know everything helps you try to see where others are coming from. That all you know is what you've been told. Take that one step further though, if you don't know everything, try to remember that others don't as well. They might act the way that they do because they are missing a crucial piece of information. Then you must be at peace with this. You could never know everything, and that's fine. 

Don't get me wrong, knowledge is a beautiful and powerful thing. Something that should be cherished and used to improve and grow. Knowledge is powerful. But I think that maybe realizing that you might not be able to know everything is a huge part of the big something that we might be trying to figure out as humanity.

You might never know it all. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't strive to know, and help others know as well. That might be why we are all here, to help each other figure IT out. Everyone around you is there to teach you something beautiful about life. You really just have to listen.

That as soon as we make conclusions, we become incorrect. The universe is unimaginably complex, and even more complex is our brain itself. Anything and everything that we perceive in this existence contains endless possibilities within endless other endless possibilities. So basically, it's not really possible to truly ""know"" anything. But if one never makes any judgements / forms any perspectives / comes to any conclusions, you become stagnant and don't move forward. We are creatures of change - we thrive on climbing the next horizon (it's how we attain happiness, really) - and so we end up being faced with a ""you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't"" dilemna. To form perspective and move forward, albeit in all likelihood to a flawed and incorrect end, or to remain open-minded but stagnant?

Here lies the irony of my entire post: I have formed a conclusion about this. Yes, this seems self-contradictory after everything I just said, but it really isn't, because my conclusion in many ways is non-conclusive. My conclusion is that the best way for us to live and see life, given our self-contradictory nature, is what I coin ""tentative conclusiveness"". Basically, to form conclusions based on the most logical and moral of the options that we are presented with and move forward decisively based on said conclusions, while still understanding that we understand nothing - that we are only making conclusions for the sake of forward progression, and still remaining openminded to other possibilities while pursuing the ones that we've chosen.

I would say that conclusions can be made for their own sake in this way too though - for example, moral conclusions. One who only uses tentative conclusiveness for directing the progression of their life, and not their perspective (remaining stagnant with that) - allows themselves to fall prey to the ""if you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything"" idea, in my opinion. Which more often than not means that their emotions will make the judgement calls, since their rationality is sitting out the match. Judgements can still be made about right and wrong while understanding their underlying deceivingly complex and mis-understandable nature. So in the same way, you can form a set of moral principles and perspectives on which to treat and try to understand other people - while still recognizing that you aren't one to judge.

Since I came up with it while high, I think it's only fair to share it with you all (thank God I finally found you...)!

I'm going to take you inside matter, inside energy, into that which makes up everything. Then we're going to come back out, and take a look at the different religious philosophies of life, and connect it all to what we're doing right now - the present moment. And that's what it's all about.

===== The Cosmology of Vibration =====

PART 1: THE MATERIAL

Look around the room you’re in right now. Everything you see, and most of the things you don’t, is made up of atoms (surprise!). Each of these atoms is in turn made up of various kinds of subatomic particles, which combine in different ways to form the several dozen atoms that make up our universe. 

In between these atoms and subatomic particles is [huge amounts of space]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kypne21A0R4), proportional to the vast distances between stars and galaxies. These particles, specifically electrons, repel one another to give us the illusion of matter. Objects in the world don’t actually touch each other. The electrons in your hands are repelling the electrons in the keyboard, similar to the way magnets repel one another. We conceptualize of electrons as traveling in orbits, but we know that’s [not really true]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_orbital). 

Going further in, subatomic particles are made up of almost infinitely smaller particles, like quarks. In between those particles are even more incredibly vast distances of space. These particles are called “elementary particles,” meaning they aren’t themselves made up of anything further, but that’s probably not true. We used to think atoms were elementary. 

As we travel further and further inside matter, the only constants appear to be empty space and energy. This energy [vibrates in varying frequencies]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECkG_JdodMA&amp;feature=related) (minute 4 or so) within the void, repelling itself, creating what we believe is matter. This makes sense, since matter and energy are [interchangeable]( http://www.deism.com/images/einfun.jpg). And this completes the illusion of our physical world.

But matter isn’t the only thing that can be described by vibrations. Light and magnetism are of course [waves of energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation), and waves themselves are an [expression of vibration]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave). “Color” is just our eyes and brains interpreting certain wavelengths of light. “Sound” is just our ears and brains interpreting vibrations within matter. Even gravity is believed to act as a [vibrating wave]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_radiation).

Thus, our physical universe is really just an expression of fluctuating and vibrating energy, interpreted by our senses.

PART 2: THE NON-MATERIAL

Now that we look at the universe through this lens, certain common denominators among the world religions start to make more sense logically.

The Abrahamic traditions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, mainly) are so grouped not just because they share Abraham as their spiritual grandfather, but because aside from some small (and admittedly key) details, they all worship an [essentially similar God]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_conceptions_of_God). This God is described as being eternal, omniscient, omnipresent, indivisible, a “creator,” unknowable, and unreachable. However, this God, described in the Abrahamic traditions as a being, can be communicated with – each religion disagrees on how, but certainly, no religious person will deny that one can *feel* God.

The Indian religions (namely Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism) appear to share little else than geography in common – each stemming from the Vedic religion in India. Hinduism features a baffling array of gods, deities, prophets, and saints – but at its core, Hinduism is less about the worship of particular deities and more about the [practice of worship]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindusim#Beliefs) itself. It’s not uncommon in India (I’ve been lucky enough to travel there) to find shrines of Jesus or Mary next to shrines of Ganesh. And even so, Hinduism features Krishna as its principal creator. Krishna has a universal form which is everything and nothing, he is omnipotent and omniscient, and is [depicted]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Avatars_of_Vishnu.jpg) with sometimes hundreds of arms and heads looking in all directions, to symbolize this omnipresence. 

Jainism and Buddhism share the core idea of a soul, which is potentially divine, and seeks to become one with the universe. The religions differ on how a soul achieves this enlightened state, but they agree that such a state exists – and that enlightenment is the realization of becoming one with the universe (Nirvana in Buddhism), which can be achieved during life – it’s not an afterlife. 

Finally, the Taoic traditions (Taoism, Mahayana Buddhism, Shinto, and others) are all centered around the idea of the Tao. To try to describe the Tao, they believe, is pointless (just try out [/r/Taoism]( http://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/) for yourself), and you have to describe *around* it to get it. The Tao cannot be known, only understood. At that point, you become enlightened, and that is when you realize your essential part in the one-ness of the universe as a whole.

To me, these religions are coming from very different places, cultures, and belief systems (it’s these culturally subjective values which form the different religions in the first place) and attempting, I believe, to arrive at essentially the same idea: the full and real understanding of the universe, including you, as being one vibration of energy. Of course the western religions, growing out of Aristotle’s subject/object dualism, regard this energy or vibration as something (or someONE) separate, apart from yourself, whereas the eastern religions, based more on the idea of the universal singularity, see it as less a being and more a state OF being. 

The realization of this singularity of vibration is what some call enlightenment.

PART 3: EVERYTHING ELSE

Now that we have those ideas unified, we can start to see where this applies everywhere. For example, the [Golden Rule]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rule), the ethical standard that I think no one would really disagree with, and which is present in almost every single belief system and even rule of law around the world, is obvious when you consider that we are all varying expressions of this vibrating energy. You have to treat others as you would want to be treated, because in a way, you *are* others. You are treating yourself; or, more accurately, the universe is treating itself.

Most qualities we prize in people - generosity, humility, honesty, charisma - we prize because they are inclusive and shy away from the idea of being ""separate."" Those qualities we shun - greed, pride, dishonesty, rudeness - these things are exclusive, and encourage the ""me vs. you"" subject/object dualism.

Art is a debate in itself, but if art is a communication between artist and viewer, then it's a communication of unspoken communion as one in the universe. If art is just an experience, and not a communication, then it's an experience of momentary realization of this singularity.

Even most good advice we receive, which ends up sounding the same everywhere – be yourself, be passionate about what you do, live in the moment, *Carpe Diem*, simplicity is better - all these ideas have been around for thousands of years, and all universal stories come derive their themes from these basic ideas. 

And all of them, of course, seem obvious when you realize what we’re all made of. The greatest prayer, the greatest homage, the finest dissection of our world is having your mind open to the present moment, understanding what you are and opening yourself to the chaotic nature of the vibrating universe.",,False,,t5_2s5se,False,,,True,t3_gj8xw,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/gj8xw/cosmology_of_vibration_everything_is_made_up_of/,

Obviously but what about a non mammal. Crocodiles? Most likely right? What about a butterfly or an ant? Most would probably say no. Why? Because they are more automated and they don't think.... right? Most would say an ants life is just a series of chemical reactions. But what about us? Are we any different? We make descisions based on calculations. So if we cross a street our brain can figure out exactly when its safe based on several factors. We eat because we are drawn to pleasure just like an ant is drawn to a trail of pheromones. This is how all of our actions work. Our brain anylizes the environment and ""we"" calculate the positive and negative outcomes and our brain or you makes a decision.
How is that any different than an insect? Its all just percentages, you wont eat another cookie because chemicals have told you that you don't need food. Depending on all the chemical balances in your brain you might piss yourself or jump out of a building if you're on fire. You act irrationally and do things based on how much of a certain molecule you have. Give ants certain substances and theu will do the same thing. Is the ant hungry? Does he experience hunger or is it just an autonamus proccess of autimatically seeking food? Whatever the answer is, it begs the question what's the difference?
I'm going to get to the point but here's a thought experiment. Imagine you're an alien and as such time goes by 1000 times faster for you. You visit Earth for the first time and decide to watch the people from the sky. You'll see what looks like bacteria or ants building structures and growing just like mold. Wtf is that? You zoom in and these growths (cities) contain individual cells. These cells seem extremely advanced until you realize they contain many hundreds of millions of cells. And these cells even have structures. And if you look at the big cells (People) you'll see predictable reactions. Car crash? Specialized cell takes victim to be repaired. Look at blood cells and its the same. A group of cells doing its job. What about the inner workings of a our cells? The nucleus makes decisions based soley on chemicals and percentages and such. But what about the molecules of this nucleus? If a certain chemical is introduced a predictable outcome happens. Inside these molecules are waves of probability that I only understand the basics of. You can make a prediction and based on our sciences certain reactions will ocur. Kind of like the ambulance example I gave rigjt? Just much less variance.
So what you have is a series of reactions that get less and less predictable as the system gets more and more complex. So why should chemicals interacting be considered consciousness just because we are at the top level and predictability is low? Does this make any sense? You would probably define conscioussness as being aware of oneself but isn't our brain just complicated enough that we can put ourselves in a series of possible future outcomes and we have the computing power to do it the best of any other species. But at the end its just chemicals and probabilities. Just a bigger scale.
So either everthing and every piece of matter is conscioss because like we experience it ( obviously without emotions or any bodily actions ) or nothing is. Well I know I'm conscience so my conclusion is any and all matter has a consciousness to it.
This idea came somewhat from ego loss stories and other trip reports. Im not sure how much I buy into it though because I think we have soul or spirit and that this fits into my worldview nicely but I digress.

Have you seen the 10th dimension explained video? Well, my idea stems from that so I suggest you watch it [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjsgoXvnStY&amp;feature=player_embedded#!”) . Ok, my idea comes from asking 
&gt;“which dimension is consciousness in? or, is it completely outside of dimension entirely?"" 

My answer is consciousness is the 4th dimension. It fits the description perfectly.

**Reason 1:** 

-Objects in the 2nd dimension create a 1 dimensional shadow (imagine shining a light on perfectly flat circle. On the ground there’d be a 1 dimensional line. 

-3 dimensional objects create a 2d shadow. 

-Following that logic 4 dimensional objects create 3d shadows. Flinn explains it best [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTfJifUqq54) , you can stop watching at around 49 secs. (that weird floating 4th dimensional shadow is called a tesseract btw)

**Reason 2:** 

-The 2nd dimension is a 1 dimensional object perpendicular to the 1st dimension, no? imagine a circle, (left, right); (top, bottom). 

-The 3rd dimension is a 2 dimensional object perpendicular to both the 1st and the second. However, in this case perpendicular no longer implies 90 degree angles and thus the divide is harder to imagine but not yet impossible. Imagining the third dimension is the step up from imagining a circle on a piece of paper, to imagining a sphere in the palm of your hand(left, right);(top, bottom);(in, out). 

(Note at this point you have to start imagining real objects you can touch and hold, not cartoons in your head.) 

-The fourth dimension, following the previous progression, would have to be a dimension that is perpendicular to all real objects. Can you imagine this? You can imagine a 4d shadow as a tesseract(see reason 1). 

However, you can’t imagine the real 4th dimension. why is that?

**Here comes my idea:**
 
Each time you step into another dimension you rip a hole in the one you’re currently in. To imagine a 4d object you’d have to rip a hole in the 3rd dimension. That is, rip a hole into all real objects. You can’t imagine the real 4th dimension because **IT IS YOU**. You (conscious awareness) are precisely that 'hole' in reality. Everything outside of consciousness (i.e. your physical body) is simply a shadow so to speak. I also find it interesting that a tesseract (4d shadow) is a cube within a cube. It eerily describes the relationship between mind and body.

I still don’t know where and how “time” fits into all of this. Maybe we could have something like a conscious-time alternative to space-time; or both. Or maybe time is completely outside any dimension. Maybe it’s the canvas on which dimensions are painted. Maybe it’s the ink.
I have more ideas about the higher dimensions but this post is long enough so I’ll leave it at that. So, is there any validity to this? Care to expand? I’d love to hear what you guys think.  
________
**TL;DR:** sorry no easy way to sum this up. Stop being lazy, go back and read it. I’d really love your input
_________
**Aside:** Where do ideas come from? How responsible are you for even your own ideas? Neuroscience has [shown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ4nwTTmcgs) that we make decisions way before we realize it. Maybe these ideas and decisions are made in the higher dimensions 5, 6, 7…?

I understand where these people are coming from, but last night I was thinking about how different things would be if instead of ""hero-ising"" people for being willing to fight for their country or religion, we became people who are willing to *give up* our country or religion in order to *avoid* fighting.

Through advances in science we have shown that humans and everything else on Earth is made of smaller and smaller particles until we get down to the atomic level. From there humans can't really discern a smaller piece, but this is most likely just because we are not capable of seeing/understanding particles that small. Leading physicists are now discussing 'String Theory,' a new theory they say may now prove to be the 'unified theory' of how everything works that Einstein had worked to find. Basically, the idea is that everything that exists is in 12 dimensions...thats right, 12. To think about it better, 2D is what you can draw on paper, 3D is what you can see in 3-D (what we see), and from there things get complicated. Basically, time is one of the dimensions and then all of the rest are somehow folds of previous dimensions moving around, but they aren't as well defined or imagined as 'time' is for us. The visualization of string theory imagines that atoms (or smaller particles than that even) are made up of constantly vibrating strings that may look like a wobbling rubber band.

Now, my idea was that what if positive and negative 'energy' or 'forces' could be created by everyday actions and thoughts, and existed as one of these dimensions, affecting things that happen in 2D, 3D, 4D(time), etc. without physically being seen (the same as the way you cannot 'see' time). The idea is that this dimension exists all around us, without being seen or felt, but consists of force vectors created by all living things on Earth in a plane exactly fitting over ours. As we move through our day we emit these positive and negative forces (also discussed commonly as karma, positive energy, vibes, etc.) constantly, and create a huge world of vectors formed by us and others that collide and change constantly. These vectors collide on perpetually forever as they continually change and collide as new ones are formed and change the shape of the space. At the same time, this dimension connects to ours through the vibration patterns of the strings which are the exact same as the planes created in our karma dimension. So basically, as the surface/map/whatever in the karma dimension changes, so does the pattern of the strings, which make our atoms move, and so on, and so forth until we get to actual human movement and reality. Then if you think about the fact that all of your thoughts are formed by electrical impulses and chemicals in your brain, you can make the connection here, too, to your movement, back to chemicals in your brain, down to atomic form, down to strings with the surface pattern of the , energy/karma dimension, formed by your energy vectors, formed by your actions/movement, formed by chemicals in your brain, and so on forever and ever. Therefore, human life and thoughts are all constantly changing and adapting into new forms never seen before, such as new novels, ideas, movies, etc.

I breathed the cool, empty air above the heights of the tallest mountains.
I saw the clouds break and glanced upon the vast, immense black vista of space towering above Earth's atmosphere.
 
The brutal, uninviting vacuum failed to slow me down in my ascent. My curious spirit breached the freezing nothingness of cosmos and flew upon our Moon. I stood on the desolate, chalky surface of the sterile orb and journeyed towards the cold, dark side. Envision the amazing hostility of the far side. A place where the sun will never shine and our kind has never set foot on. Beyond the already astounding horizon of a dead face of a dead satellite lies an even greater expanse. The incredible distances of further celestial bodies is overwhelming. However, this is just where it starts. Our solar system is more-or-less known and well studied, but beyond it's bonds lies a colossal range of interstellar neighbourhoods.
 
There are literally dozens if not hundreds of similar systems in a currently unreachable distance from our home world. These are all contained in the Milky Way galaxy, which dwarfs us like a beach is to a speck of sand. However, the staggering explosion of distance continues. Our own uncharted Milky Way is overshadowed by a galactic group that contains the massive Andromeda galaxy that embodies twice, maybe thrice the number of stars and planets. Even the numerically ridiculous galactic group is just an insignificant spot on the Virgo supercluster. We could continue my journey even further, but already I am amazed and intrigued by my meaningless in the face of the monstrous known universe. I exponentially accelerated my rise but I stupidly underestimated the cosmos. 
 
Even more horrifying is that my voyage was purely in space and excluded time. Time is unthinkably more mysterious, shrouded by our minuscule perception. There must be what we imagine as almost-infinite events, locations, beings, spirits, molecules, elements, atoms in our universe. My humble human mind can't imagine or handle the variations, contrasts and expressions of all that existed and exists. 
 
Nothing truly changes. Nothing is ever truly erased or truly created. Everything changes, modifies and adapts. My mind will detoriate, my body will rot and my legacy will be forgotten. I shall become dust, lifeless matter. But this dust will not stay in that state. It will collapse and eventually burn when our Sun shall evolve into a red giant and consume our world. The dust will remain in space and will be driven by time. One day(figuratively, as a solar day is utterly insignificant in cosmic-grade time) I may escape the binds of our dying sun and perhaps participate in the creation of something purely new. Or maybe I will become a cold black dwarf, the corpse of a once blazing sun, desolate and remote.
 
Space provides while Time advances.

I know you’re bored, too. Life is boring. And no fucking wonder—we’re all the same. We’re all zombies.

Somewhere along the way, someone defined “Normal.” Normal meant getting a job with “benefits;” finding a hot, young piece of ass; buying a sweet ride; and raising a shitload of kids in a tidy house in arm’s length of the city. To be or do anything else made you a weirdo. A dirty hippie. A socialist (gasp)! And for some reason, the rest of society complied. 

Thus, the good folks at Eli Lilly and Company brought us the miracle most-commonly known as Prozac. You no longer had to be a weirdo. A dirty hippie. A socialist. Pop this pill and you could be Normal. 

Which begs the question—Did the notion of Normal evolve naturally on its own or did the good folks at Eli Lilly and Company have something to do with it? 

It doesn’t matter now. We are where we are. And now everybody is Normal. And it’s fucking boring.

The little things that society views as not Normal are the same things that make an individual an individual. When I was younger, my extreme anxiety was just part of who I was. I was the anxious one in the group. And somebody else was always sad. And someone else liked going to church. Thanks to Celexa, I am no longer the anxious one. Thanks to Zoloft, another is no longer sad. Thanks to Lexapro, Xanax, and Vicodin, the other still likes going to church. And nothing ever changes. Nothing is ever new. Pictures of what we are eating for dinner become exciting. And Evolution wonders what the fuck?!  

Just listen to the radio. Nobody is writing songs about heartache and pain that reach through the speakers and grab you by the heart and bring tears to your eyes. Because nobody is experiencing heartache and pain strongly enough to understand what it even is. Everything is muted. Now, instead of pining over lost love, dissecting missed opportunities, learning from our mistakes, we pop a pill. Now instead of feeling real human emotions, we’re pissed off that the kid making minimum wage at the drive-thru window would dare put pickles on our disgusting, greasy slop on a bun when we specifically said, “No Goddamn Pickles!!!” And you can hear that in the music. 

And see it on TV.

And live it in tiny boxes.

And that’s just the way it is. The pyramid keeps those in charge safe. Trying to change the entire system is pointless. You’ll never succeed. Unless you have a trillion-dollar money-making idea. Because change only comes when someone with power personally benefits. That’s one thing I know.

Instead, you have to decide to be happy in spite of it. Understand how the system is set up and works, then live around it. Below it. Above it. Change the system in yourself. Redefine Normal in your own world, but don’t expect others to follow. And be okay with that.

The rest will come when they’re ready, which may not be ever. And too bad for them. Because the more you put into the system, the farther away from happiness you get. But at least you’re Normal.

For Christmas, we may have received a pair of Nike Air Jordan's- but did we need them? Did we even ask for them? We've just been given these commercialized products year round, multiple times a year; iphones, designer clothes, concert tickets, perfumes and colognes, trips across oceans... we've been groomed by profit since the day we were born. So now what's going to happen? 


I think our generation may be lacking the same drive that our parents' one had, but that's not to say we don't have one. Our generation has seen the ""good life"", we've seen how easy it came to us, and how easy it is for us to do whatever we want with it. We know what it's like to live comfortably. But we don't want easy; we've seen what greed and capitalism has done to the world. As I type this, there are unspeakable tragedies forking away at nations on the other side of the planet-- so how can this be the ""good life"" if there are so many people suffering? Our drive isn't to achieve beyond monetary measure anymore. Our drive stems from our need to figure out what our **own** idea of the ""good life"" is. It isn't universal. We're individuals, we have different dreams. What the ""good life"" can offer us is different for every person. So now we're embarking on this thing called ""life"", where we have the opportunity and the resources to *actually* **chase** after our dreams. 

At the end of the day, we can thank our parents for paving the roads, and then illuminating them. They branch off in all directions. Even though I have a job and am not entirely financially dependent on my parents, I know if it ever came down to it, they'd lend me money to support me on whatever it is I may try to do with my life. This is how we're most fortunate. 

I explain go my parents everyday that living doesn't mean working another day, another day closer to death. It means experiencing everything around you, all the time, with your senses wide open; learning, feeling, and celebrating. Now that they've embraced it and understand, I encourage you all to do the same. Fuck that business/econ/engineering degree if it's not what you want to do. There's so much more for everyone out there.

If faster than light travel is discovered to be possible after the technological singularity then we could consume the cosmos at an unimaginable speed and that could explain why we're alone, if you aren't the first civilization then your planet would be converted into computronium by the first civilization.

**Theory 2:**

We don't see any alien civilizations because a sufficiently advanced civilization could create their own universes in black holes/ travel to other earlier universes that couldn't possibly contain hostile competition.

**Theory 3:**

A multiverse could exist inside an ultracomputer constructed out of the fabric of space time in a universe that has long ago undergone entropy death.

For example, you want to meet with a guy named Larry. To find Larry in all of existence, you need an 'x', a 'y', a 'z', and a time coordinate 't', right?  Why a 'y'? Because you may know the cross streets (x and y), but you don't know if he's in Tony's Pizza or the apartment above it; you need to know his elevation :) And you may know that Larry is definitely going to be at Tony's Pizza, but you still need to know *when* in order to meet with him. That's 4 dimensions. Isn't that crazy? Think of the Universe... you only need 4 pieces of information to find something in it. Holy crap. Anyway.

Another way to think about the 4 dimensions is that they are the minimum amount of data you need to *coexist* with another object in space-time, i.e. be in proximity to another object both spatially, and in time. But Larry and I don't matter to the Universe, do we? We're just the same old atoms. Technically all the atoms in me have and will coexist with Larry's atoms for all of time. Why make the distinction at the level of a person or a rabbit or a clock? We are all just atoms, grouping together differently over time. And if all atoms that exist have always and will always exist, then all this careful measurement of time that we're doing, like trying to pinpoint *when* the Big Bang occurred, is meaningless to the universe. Because time doesn't matter to.. *matter itself*.

Therefore, it does not exist. At best, it is an ""undefined"", like when you divide by zero.

Don't believe me that life cannot be defined? Sure, you can try to give a weak, cop-out answer and quote the dictionary 'definition', but there is no universal definition that makes sense in all cases.

Is life organic? Not necessarily. There are conceivably lifeforms which are not carbon based. Organic = carbon based. So being organic is not a fundamental requirement of life, and therefore cannot be used as the definition of life.

What about self-replication? That seems pretty basic. But what if we can create Artificial Intelligence. Wouldn't that count as life? If we could create a being that could experience the full range of human emotions, I think it would be more than fair to call that life. But that being, manufactured by something other than its own kind, wouldn't necessarily be a self-replicating. Therefore, even self-replication cannot define life.

Consciousness? Intelligence? Well, there's no reason to believe that bacteria are conscious or intelligent. But they're still considered life forms. So even consciousness isn't a definition of life.

It appears that life can have many definitions. Which means it is undefined. That's what happens when you divide by zero. You get many definitions, which means the answer is undefined. But that's a bit of a paradox. It goes against the definition of the word definition to have many definitions. 

Life, at best, seems to be a linguistic homophone. We use one single word to express many different ideas. But we fail to realize that we *use* many different words, depending on the context. We sort of have this feeling that there's only one definition of life. But that's false.

What happened is that we came up with the word ""life"" to explain our conscious experience of the universe. Death was the lack of that conscious experience. But then we decided that animals have life too, since they also respond to their environments, express fear, and eventually decay. Even lower animals that don't have a conscious experience of the universe seem to decay. So we kept going, trying to cling on to the word life. We threw in terms like self-replication so that we could try to make sense of the word we invented. But the word life never really meant anything other than our conscious experience of the world. So by the time we got down to carbon atoms (organic chemistry), we sort of figured out that life doesn't have a definition. 

Even if life just means the basic ability to interact, then even atoms do that.

 Life appears simply to be the constant struggle between two states. The two basic states being positive and negative. Yes or No. 1 or 0. On or off. Light or dark. Buddhists and Taoists recognize this is the fundamental nature of the universe and of life. 

If there is *any* meaning to life at all, it's this: The universe is alive. Simply, *existence* is life. That which exists is alive. Real death is non existence. Atoms are alive. Ideas are alive. The universe is life.

&gt;
&gt;Is this any way feasible? Or verifiable even.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe another way to word what (I suspect) won't make too much sense: We all like eating different things, and our taste buds are all mutated slightly different, could their mutation survival rate (i.e. preferences) point to their (and our shared) ancestral past?

    Is the universe more dense at the center? And get's less so the farther away from the center?
    
    That could mean the the universe is more than 14 billion years old.
    
    Maybe it's far older, and there's nothing beyond 14 billion lightyears to see?

    It's often said that time is looked at wrong
    
    That it is actually a constant, and not linear, like space
    
     
    
    Maybe it's vice versa, it could go either way
    
    Both time and Space are things that always are, and don't progress -- as we perceive space
    
    Or they're both things that progress -- as we see time
    
    One location vs another could be a linear phenomena, like one time vs another
    
    
    
    But maybe we're viewing these dimensions all wrong,
    
    Neither of these ways of viewing time and space are 'correct'
    
    
    
    When we became sentient
    
    We had to figure out how to look at them
    
    We evolved to choose to perceive both dimensions as perceive them do now
    
    Not because that's how they actually are
    
    But because that's how we evolved to look at them

To be honest i've never given much thought to pondering or trying to use philosophy while high, but lately i've been having many ""out of body"" experiences while stoned that i've considered interesting. What this means is that i've started to see myself as a person outside of who I truly am, as if I were another person observing my true self go on and about on his daily activities.

The salvageable knowledge that comes from this happening is that I can ponder on whether the things I do are not only good to me, but to everybody else that would stumble upon them. These actions could range from how I walk, or portray myself in a party, to artistic endeavours (being a musician and writer); the question hence comes: How will people -or society in general, perhaps- perceive *this* or *that*, which has been realized by me?

The thought of this introspection may sound anxious or silly, as this very well could also be done sober but, given that I have an individualist approach to life, where most of the time outside opinions don't truly matter to me (thanks to Ayn Rand's ""The Fountainhead""), to have these musings happen while high has captivated my mind. Perhaps my subconscious is trying to tell me something? I wouldn't know, the context is important for if I were to be given a proper response.

Now, these stars are producing UV-rays that pierce the seemingly endless distances through the void between us. That small ray of UV from each star is barely anything.

_________________________________

Why would anybody want to be inferior at something? Personally I hate the fact that my eyesight is less than perfect. I'd do anything to have perfect eyes again. I often get jealous of others with perfect vision. It seems like much of what you are comes down to luck. The rich and successful aren't anything other than temporary objects forged by complex chemistry. Everything you see around you is flowing along in a path of least resistance... even the tough decisions you have to make are done because they're the easiest possible thing for you to do at the time. 

So there are no real choices. You're not a creature capable of choice. 

Then you wake up and realize that there are many others like yourself who are just a little bit luckier. They're still human like you, they still have the same features as you, they even feel the same way as you, but they're not you. They're smarter, better, richer, stronger, and more fortunate than you. You begin the realize just how much you lack in the categories you admire and you wish you were them. You wish you were them so badly that you begin to hate yourself. You hate yourself because you realize that the way you were put together is less than optimal and thus you are doomed a life of undue discomfort. 

Great job. You won the genetic lottery to exist, but you failed the genetic lottery to exist comfortably. 

So now what? Perhaps we should end ourselves and quietly fade away. Leave science to find ways to allow parents to make children with ideal traits better suited for the modern world. After all why would you want to be inferior when you can be a genius? Or perhaps we should suffer with ourselves until death beckons us to enter the void. Perhaps we hear death's voice already ringing in our ears giving us the confidence to cross over. 

Finally. You realize the hopelessness of your situation and you welcome death. You were born without memory and you'll die without memory. 

__________

Anyway, I guess I feel bothered by how most and possibly all of what I am comes down to things I don't control. I'm just a passenger on a thrill ride where at the end they cut off my head no matter what. Maybe I'm just bothered by my mortality? I feel like we live in such an accomplishment driven society which I think is odd when you consider that your accomplishments are shattered from your prospective upon death. Maybe I'm also bothered because I feel that the quest for greatness while not only incredibly hard but is also something I won't be able to hold on to later.

God made sense because it provided the illusion that my existence, against all odds, had meaning. I became really saddened by the inexplicably of life however much grandeur I drew out of understanding it it still rung hollow. Approximately since this same time, I first tried cannabis, and ~~(after the initial novelty wore off) something just clicked, my understanding, my existence, being self-aware: it was a perfect fit. The hole morphed from a god shaped hole, to that the shape of a leaf– a plant! The plant life was helping the human life: life helping life.

Can anything in a universe made up by laws and forces really be ""free""? 
Maybe it is the illusion of our brains, the reason it behaves as though it was an onion with many layers. And you lose track at what layer you're searching in or what you're even searching for, so you will think that your decisions comes from ""you"". That there even is a ""you"". 

I digress, that was not what just came to my mind. I don't know if you've thought about this before. If you have I'm glad to join the group, if you haven't, come and join me. Here goes:

The definition of free will as stated, what is it and do we have it? Many people would argue that life would be better without pain, suffering, death, despair and bloodshed forever. Man does not need to fight, outside of borders nor within. We can ""choose"" to be happy. But here's the kicker, if it is a choice to abandon feelings, then we have abandoned choice. Which per definition makes us bound, shackled to an eternal grin. You might argue ""So evil is just a choice, then why do we choose it?"". Because, sadly enough, we can. And therefore we will. That is the definition of free will. So the choice is not bliss or misery. It's bliss or free will. Are we willing to sacrifice our free will? The one thing that we have crowned above all others? I guess not. 
Therefore we have settled, in eons of fights between people and borders, because somewhere we collectively agreed upon that life is about the journey away from darkness, not ever reaching the light. 
But what has happened in today's world is that some people still believe that we can be eternally blissful. So they built walls, created empires, slaughtered one another, for the right of peace and freedom. Their peace and freedom. ""The selfish gene"" is born again. 
And what has happened can be seen from everywhere. People scribbling on the edge of train carts, ones and zeroes in the back of people's hard drives, people singing into the loudest of microphones, crying out that they are trapped in a system that they do not know the way out of. And what happens is fear, despair, depression, apathy, addiction, greed, everything that we know are bad for us. But we keep on building. We keep on turning our backs and ignoring the light that lies beneath us. We keep reaching higher and higher. First to God in the heavens then to the Stars. To Cosmos.

But somehow the illusion of free will exists within us. Have we adapted or are we waiting for a parallax to take place?

Now I have a certain aspiration, the one you get when your high, but that stays with you while sober. I want to be a candidate in the 2026 election and not be in the running but win. And I want to win the fuck out of it. 

Naturally theres a lot more to being president than just the requirements, not much to be elected, but still enough to be elected and become a better president. I think I like in those requirements now, but maybe I could learn them in 16 years.

Some people are realistic in their want to be president. Most think they can't, a small portion tries, and an satisfyingly few become.

No idea where I'm going with this

So recently, whilst doodling and whatnot, I ended up thinking about determinism, because I had been trying to explain it to someone earlier that day and had a difficult time conveying the concept.  Anyway, it struck me that the transporter in Star Trek serves as a really good example of what it means to be determined by your physical composition, and thus, shows you what a world without free will would look like.

Dude gets in transporter, goes to planet, OH SHIT NIGGA SPACE TENTACLE and so he gets transported back.  Now, shit gets different when you watch that return sequence.  Every time, they come back in the middle of doing whatever it was they were doing when they were transported. 

Now, think about how those things are said to work.  Thing takes every atom in your body and bleep bloops 'em through space 'till they coalesce into your body.  Now, determinism is all about how you, what you think, what you do, everything about your subjective experience is a result of the exact composition of your shit (figuratively, yo, and I guess a bit literally too) at that current moment.  Your actions in the future aren't necessarily pre-determined, they're just a result of your ever changing physical composition (atoms and etc.).

For example, if that idea of determinism were true, you could theoretically construct an exact, atom-for-atom duplicate of me, and it would be doing the same things, thinking the same thing, perceiving the world, at least in that moment, exactly as I am right now.  Of course that would immediately change, but the idea is that the transporter does that exact thing - takes your atoms and flip turns 'em through space back up into the ship.  And so the dude (Lt. Gonzales, let's say) ends up in mid-action, scream, delusion-brought-on-by-mind-beetles, etc., for a second, then snaps back into the reality around him.

So yeah, seems to me like that's what a world without free will would look like.  Not all that different at first sight, but definitely operating on a totally different mechanism than what it feels like to us.

Your computer may not have emotions, or be advanced enough to be called an ""Artificial Intelligence"", but on some level it has a *very* basic mind.

Our consciousness is an emergent property of all the calculations done by our meat-computers we call ""brains"". 

It sort of doesn't make sense that the mechanical activity of chemicals and electricity in our head can cause the *sensation* of consciousness. Yet, that's exactly what happens.

It's like imagining a mechanical computer made out of gears. No matter how big and complex you make such a machine, even if it could somehow be as large as the univese, for most of us it seems it would be impossible that even such a technological marvel could create the *sensation* of consciousness and thought, even if it could outwardly appear intelligent by accurately calculating all the same things our brains do.

Similarly, we look at our computers and gawk at the idea that such primitive hardware could even have a basic form of mind. That it could have even a basic *sensation* of mind.

But when we look at the computer monitor and see inside the mind of the computer, a glimpse of the ""sensation"" of its mind, we know that even if that *were* the case that our computer had a primitive sensation of consciousness, that even then, it would not know that *we* existed here on the outside.

If such sensation in a computer existed, everything you typed into the computer would be ""felt"" by the computer -- *assumed* by the computer -- to be an original thought of the computer itself. The computer would never even suspect that they were not original thoughts; that  the creativity it feels is actually being typed into it from the outside. From a plane of existence it can't even fathom.

Yet every time we surf the internet, your computer dreams of images of sunsets and mountains and videos and things it could never comprehend or see in its own world. Yet, the computer probably just takes it in stride. It thinks of strange things, but that's normal right? 

And then humans we wake up. A new day. Scattered memories of dreams and strange mysticism from the night before. Most of our dream made no sense. But that's fine, dreams are just weird like that. 

Why do we even dream at all? Well, best not to worry about strange things that make no sense. Just another odd quirk of the world around us. Anyway, we're sure some scientists will figure it out some day. We take the weirdness in stride.

-- Arthur C. Clarke

Are you okay with the prospect of a journey that lacks any real destination?

According to the evidence I've managed to gather in my humble nineteen years, the chance is high that you are. We've all had adventures. We've all not known what we were doing while on them, and we weren't really sure when they'd be over, either. That was the point, wasn't it? The pointlessness? 

We just wanted to experience what was around the next corner. The world would show us. We didn't need a master plan.

But we happen to be conscious, and there are parts of us that happen to be disengaged from the current moment enough to remember other moments. Remembering means growing, and growth brings questions. What's all this about, anyway? Why remember? Why grow? Is there a higher purpose we are growing into? Can we fail to meet it? I'm not sure if there could be more natural bursts of critical thought. But consider:

What if the ultimate higher purpose is no purpose at all? Is not the most all-encompassing purpose the lack of one entirely?

I mean, I used to have all these theories about life.  I thought I had everybody figured out, even God, but I don't.  I think the woods, being away from all the clingy soot of commercialism, have taught me life is enormous, and I am very tiny in the middle of it.  I feel, at times, like a droplet of water in a raging river.  I know for a fact that as a grain of sand compares in size to the earth itself, I compare in size to the cosmos.  I am that insignificant.  And yet the chemicals in my brain that make me feel beauty when I look up at the stars, when I watch the sunset, indicate I must be here for a reason.  I think I would sum it up this way: life is not a story about me, but it is being told to me, and I can be glad of that.  I think that is the why of life and, in fact, the why of this ancient faith I am caught up in: to enjoy God.  The stars were created to dazzle us, like a love letter; light itself is just a metaphor, something that exists outside of time, made up of what seems like nothing, infinite in its power, something that can be experienced but not understood, like God.  Relationships between men and women indicate something of the nature of God - that He is relational, that He feels love and loss.  It's all metaphor, and the story is about us; it's about all of us who God made, and God Himself, just enjoying each other.  It strikes me how far the commercials are from this reality, how deadly they are, perhaps.  Months ago I would have told you life was about doing, about jumping through religious hoops, about impressing other people, and my action would have told you this is done by buying possessions or keeping a good image or going to church.  I don't believe that anymore.  I think we are supposed to stand in deserts and marvel at how the sun rises.  I think we are supposed to sleep in meadows and watch stars dart across space and time.  I think we are supposed to love our friends and introduce people to the story, to the peaceful, calming *why* of life.

It all takes place in one persons mind throughout his life. The only other character is someone who does not live in the physical world but is inside it, in the sense that he exists in peoples minds. The mind is the only place that anything can be truly said to exist. The outside world is only known to us as it appears within us by the testament of our senses. The imagination is the most real world that we know because we each know it first hand. Seeing our ideas take form is like being able to see the sun come into being. We have no equivalent to the purity of that in our account of the outside world. The outer world appears to each of us as one thing and it is always also a multitude of others. Inside to outside and outside to inside are never-ending. Trying and giving up are a form of breathing.

My describing The Empyrean as a story is accurate from my viewpoint, but misleading, as there are no road signs to lead someone else to perceive a clear story out of it. There was no intention to write what would be seen as clear-cut story, though it is one to me. Being that it takes place in the mind of one person, no laws of time and space, or concrete relationships exist therein. This is to say that if you look into it with your logical brain you will only strain yourself and come up with nothing. The words were specifically written to document an inner experience of life, the kind that a person has extreme difficulty translating to anyone else. Part of the intention was to write words to connect with other people who have been, or are, overwhelmed by the confusing, inescapable inner world they must live in. Equal attention was given to writing words that would gently direct themselves towards the listeners' intuitive brain, and their sub-conscience, which I believe comprehends and catalogues everything in a much richer and more multi layered way than our conscious mind. Like a lot of lyrics, it was written to be perceived in as many ways as there are people hearing it. A person to whom the words have no clear, conscious meaning may derive more from it than someone who reads it as I do, and so I recommend hearing or reading it however you will. It would have been simpler to say nothing at all but this only fully occurred to me today, as I have gradually realized that by saying what it is to me, I am encouraging people to see it my way and to me, that's not what rock lyrics are for. I believe rock lyrics should be open to interpretation and I wrote these so they could be.

A box has 6 sides, peanuts taste salty and C# sounds exactly so. Generally, we can identify things by describing them in ways we agree on.

Consider if, however, everybody sees things in a completely different way. It would seem completely alien to any other individual. What I see as blue could be, what I would say, is green to somebody else. Yet we still both agree that the color is blue. This assumes that we share the same perception when it comes to the very laws of the universe.

Such laws are things that we have described and agreed upon, however, which would mean they would be different for everyone. What you see as the color blue could have absolutely no meaning in my perception; it would be a completely foreign sensation. But because our sensations can also be identified and described, one could see your sensations as working in the same fashion as their own. Thus, the illusion of a common perception is formed and we assume that we all see the same way.

There are a lot of hard questions that just cannot conceivably be answered by man about the universe we live in. Why is everything the way it is? Why does is seem that everything seems to work out perfectly for our existence? If only a couple of tweaks were made to the fundamental processes that govern how all matter and energy interact, none of this would be possible at all.

So that brings me back to the previous question. Why is everything the way it is? I feel like you have to reword the question to get more insight into it. Not why, but for what reason is everything the way it is. You could try to bring this down to a human level and ask if it is all just for us. But that is a selfish way of thinking about the universe. 

You have to be able to ask, ""For what reason has the universe made itself in such a way?"" The whole universe has to be getting something out of creating itself this way. But what? What could the whole universe get from being this way. Well if we take it back to the human perspective, you could easily say we are all as a species trying to survive, but more so we are trying to understand everything that is possible about what we are experiencing. 

Can this question not hold true about the universe itself. Could it not itself be one ""entity"" just trying to figure out what it is itself. If you look at the timeline of stars, solar systems and galaxies, it seems as if they are cyclic and working in a certain pattern. Stars are born, they get to a point in life that is prime for life on orbiting planets, then they die. But not all die in the fizzle out method. Some die and end in the glory of a black hole. There is so much beauty and mystique in black holes. Is it possible, just by the smallest fraction that black holes are just tools used by the universe(or multiverse) in order to rearrange and store information in another place?

Not nightmares exactly, they weren't like horror movies or stereotypical nightmare bs, but instead very real instances of being in other situations. My body would feel odd and I felt a loose grasp on my mind. 
(eg)
I had a recurring dream of myself and my long time best friend (we'll call him josh) and a different person (Brett) being at our elementary school after hours. We began to feel sick so we went to sit in a car. Josh gets out of the car and I don't see him for a while. Three triangles make themselves visible in the condensation on the window. A man in a small box starts speaking to me, telling me to wake up. Thats normally when my dream ends. 
The first time I smoked weed I got way to high. I was with my friend Josh, (yes same one from my childhood) and my friend Sean. We went to a local elementary school to walk around. We were all the highest we'd ever been and brand new at it, so we started to freak out a little bit. Right when it hit me the hardest I had a flashback of my dream. Josh was the same but the other man was my new friend shawn. We sat in shawns car and I drew three triangles instinctively on the windows. I decided to record myself so I could convince myself I wasn't crazy, the video turned out creepy and had horrible quality.(phone camera) but when I watched my video I figured out that I was the man from my dream, and the box was my phone.
Since then, next to every time I get high, I have flashbacks to my old dreams. I remember trying to talk to my past self while high, and remembering in my dreams, talking to my future self. ""We"" still have these odd time connection (past and present me).

It could be so colossal that the laws of physics, at least as we know them, are an obstacle for intelligent civilizations to ever communicate with one other.

Given that sentient races are such a rarity in the universe that at all times there are millions/billions of light years inbetween different societies.

Hence, forever and ever more, or at the end of the universe's existence (whichever comes first), there could have existed literally billions of intelligent civilizations in billions of solar systems, many of them existing simultaneously, but the sheer vastness of the universe is a hindrance for their communication signals to ever reach one another, thus nobody would have ever known if they were alone or not.

Then, one could raise another question; what is the point of intelligent life? I mean, objectively. What use do we have for our advanced space technology if it ultimately proves impossible to contact other beings?

I regard that as the ultimate question to everyone's existence, ""why am I here?"".

We live in a world in which we are surrounded by waves. Vibrations from all angles, bombarding our senses. Actually creating our senses. Tiny fundamental strings are vibrating right now, according to string theory at least, defining everything we know.

Our lives can be summed up quite well by following a wave. We come into this world. We learn. We ride this wave as we learn more about ourselves and our environment. We gain energy. We reach the crest of the wave, a high point in our lives... Strong, emotionally and physically... Happy and loved. It can't last forever though. We continue past the crest, now losing energy. We still gain experiences, but our bodies deteriorate, as does our emotional state. Eventually, we reach the bottom, and we die.

Imagine talking to some being that had revelations and thoughts, liked music, and could have all the varied flaws and traits available to a ""real"" brain. You might resist it mentally at first, but it won't take long before your brain starts thinking in terms of ""him"" (or her) instead of ""it"".

Let's say, instead of the computer you or I know, we have something like this: http://xkcd.com/505/ Sure, it's just a bunch of rocks--but the patterns you make from those rocks could form a brain that could think, just as effectively as a computer could, just as effectively as our universe does.

What if, instead of rocks, the guy just remembered all of the bits, and never messed up? Suppose he could do that. I believe the brain being simulated--regardless of the fact that it's only in the imagination of the rock-guy--is just as real as yours or mine. Could we not still talk to that mind, if we gave the rock-guy time enough to simulate the computer in his head?

What if, instead of bits, the man skipped some steps and just imagined a chemistry and physics directly? The only difference, now, is the rules of the universe--not the level of reality. It was all in his head before; now it's just operating with different rules. He is thinking in different terms, now, but if he's careful, the universe still follows dependable rules. In fact, it follows rules whether he's careful or not; his errors in thinking become the rules.

What if, instead of chemistry and physics, he imagines a plant directly. Again, the rules might be different now, but there are still rules. Instead of a plant, an animal. Instead of an animal, a person. Instead of a person, two.

What if the man wrote a book about the people? The universe is not bound by physics as we know it, but rather the quirks of the writer's mind. If it's true that our minds are all chemistry and physics, then any universe created by the mind operates on reliable rules--just not the rules we experience in our reality.

""Harry went to the store and got some milk. When he got to the checkout line...""

It doesn't matter what I wrote there, as long as you imagined it. For a moment, your brain simulated that story. Your brain probably continued after my input. What happened to the man? I bet you had your guesses--results of a simulation. A simulation with rules that may be hard to describe, but are rules nonetheless.

There is no fundamental difference between the reality of your decisions and the reality of the milk-buyer's decisions. If you assume the world is just a bunch of good ol' science (which I have, and I think it's so much more beautiful than any God or Mysteree could be), the universe inside your brain is not fundamentally different than the one outside of it.

this seems like a plausible theory to me. i wonder if it's testable, or if it or something like it has been tested? the idea goes like this:

a species has a specified average ""anxiety"" level. some species are more anxious, and they benefit with better hunting, and better predator avoidance. compare this to animals living in the other end of the spectrum. these animals are slower moving, and have better communication and community building tools, but they are less successful hunters and easier pray.

ideally an animal would like to have the maximum possible range of ""runtime"" control of their anxiety level. anxious during the day time; calm and social at night. obviously this would need to be constrained within appropriate safety levels.

let's say, for whatever biological reasons, this is a chemical change that cannot occur from within the animal. a chemical must be added to the system from some external source. this is where the ancestor of pot comes in. an animal species domesticated the plant based on a chemical property, and then slowly modified the species over time through ""artificial"" selection.

Also, the selection happens the other way around. Animals that benefit from the plant do better in all fields of life, and out compete those that don't. The animals are selected for increasing sensitivity to the plant, which feeds back into the plant selection.

If this, or more likely something like it, is true, then it truly is a beautiful relationship we have with this plant, and how unkind and unfair we've been to ourselves and our partner, in all these millenia, since mysticism took over.

and you can also scale down, so is that thin slice from before conscious? are individual neurons (but with a more basic type of consciousness)? are the individual cells (even more basic)? what if consciousness isn't about the matter, but the fact that seperate systems are interacting (neurons interacting with each other, different parts of the brain interacting with each other, people interacting with each other, scaling down, atoms reacting with each other through electromagnetism)

And that's important. As soon as children get to their teenage years and start gaining intellect of their own, they might come to see their parents as their ''peers'' in terms of intellectual authority. This is never good, because people are **by far the most critical of their own peers.** If they go straight from being the all-knowing mommy to being the oh-god-can-I-please-explain-how-it-works-to-you, mommy, so you don't hurt yourself, there will never be a ''rocky'' period.

So here goes:

We are wrong. We are just completely wrong in every conceivable dimension and direction. 
Let start from the beginning of science.
What is ""science""?
It's derived from the word 'knowledge' from the greek as far as I can remember and it constitutes the knowledge we have acclaimed about our universe and our place within it. Now please don't get me wrong, I love science and I love what we've come up with so far. It's amazing to see humanity progress into new eras of ""understanding"". But simply put I believe that we are wrong. 
Let's start with the first step of exploring from science point of view: measurements. 
We measure reality and come up with facts about it that supports it. It can be anything from a simple area, to complex calculus, to the gravitational constant; everything derives from our own measurements. These measurements are completely accurate within their own frame of references and anything you will come up with is valid for that reference. 
It's like saying 2+3-5=0. This does not tell us anything about any other number than 2,3 and 5 and their relationship, yet, due to mathematical logic, we can derive other ""truths"" from this. I do not believe that reality works in the same manner. 
 
Now, what says that these measurements are valid in any way, shape or form outside that reference? We do. 
And what says that we are valid? Well, ultimately our measurements do. We are our own circular argument, caught up in the middle of it. 

Let's explore the Planck length, something I assume most of you are familiar with and hopefully some of you have thought about its implications. The universes smallest pixel, beyond which our understanding of reality simply breaks down and deteriorates. 
Now, how did Max Planck derive the Planck length? Simply put it fell out of an equation, more exact, this equation:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length
This, according to Max Planck and many other renowned physicists is a fundamental part of our understanding of today's physics and I believe this to be a simple human error. 
For what says that anything really is measurable? What says that distance in the first place is a real phenomena? What says that any measurement is ""real"". 

Put it this way: 
Regardless how you measure a circle and in what unit you measure it in you will ALWAYS come up with Pi in some way. And Pi will ALWAYS have the same value. We may be alone in counting in base 10 which means that Pi might look differently in other math-standards but it will always be the exact same value. 
Does this value exist? Is it really irrational? Is it even a number? 
I would say not, it simply falls out of the equation due to our inability to understand that measuring is a very anthropic way of viewing the universe. 
That equation is not real, neither is Pi or any other constant that we have come up with. Sure, we can use the constants, but they are not there in the way that we currently imagine them to be.
This goes for Phi, e, Wao, Tau, and really any other constant you can think of. 

What I think is interesting is that our math converges on specific numbers, with tells us more of how our brains and math work rather than the universe. Why would reality have a smallest length/time-scale? I'm fairly certain it doesn't or that the question doesn't even make sense. 
But because we have a deep rooted desire of measuring (our inability to accept that things simply do not have meaning) some of these values simply ""falls out"" of our own equations, leaving us with numbers with no real meaning. Sure, we can use them, but that doesn't matter or mean anything. It's just for our own sake. 
It's like saying 5 divided by 5 is 1 and therefore we have discovered something new about the number 5. But since the number 5 does not exist the sentence ""discovered something new about number x"" is totally meaningless unless it's in its own frame of reference. 

TL;DR
I don't want to simplify this, read it or don't read it. It doesn't really matter (as I showed in the text). It's all for yours and no-one's sake. Everything falls out from our own very limited understanding and viewing-point of ""reality"", whatever it might turn out to be or not be. 

Thank you, now I'm going to smoke. If you find this interesting please leave a comment, I would be very happy to discuss this subject further if you have any thoughts about it. I might be very wrong thinking that everything wrong, but until you prove me otherwise I will believe that I am right. About the fact that we are wrong. Which doesn't even make sense. Fuck this, I need my joint. 

Peace and fucking love.

I've been thinking about the best way to describe what I consider to be ""right"" or ""wrong"". I wrote the following over the past couple of days and wanted to get other people's opinions, but feel like doing so anonymously.

The meaning of life can be described by the second law of thermodynamics. Our goal in life should be to create small low-entropy pockets throughout the universe. This agrees with what we intuitively understand as ""good"" or ""moral""; for example, life reduces local entropy while killing or destruction increases it. This approach to understanding morality provides us with an objective and scientifically derived utility function which can numerically estimate how good or bad something might be.

This method might shed light on the way we view issues shrowded in moral ambiguity. Abortion is a hotly debated subject and generally degrades into a two strongly defended opinions: those who are for or against it in any situation.

In the time I have spent here at college, I haven't used this pad for much more than breaking up my weed on (note the marks and discolorations and faint scent of the next few pages). And that's fine. I didn't want to write until I was ready.

Tonight I napped, and then meditated. You could call it procrastination- I do have a bit of homework- but what a fabulous result! I feel so indescribably wonderful, I am practically forcing myself to procrastinate further by taking the time to articulate the results of my brief meditation on paper.

I have had hundreds of conversations in the past six weeks, and each one has been equally enlightening in its own way. One of the more profound ones occurred when I spent a few hours in ""The Fridge"" with a few students of a Philosophy class. The guy said that I had reached a tautology, a recurrent truth for all of my arguments. I think that's what he meant; it sounds pretty neat. My tautology is that all existence is perfection. Every piece of existence is perfection, too. The only thing that cannot be perfect is that which does not exist.

And that's great! It helps me to love and accept everything in my world without exception. However, another point that the guy, Scott, made was that my tautology cannot take a stance on morality. And I have a very strong morality! So I said to him, ""Shit"".

But tonight's meditation was very profound. I reconciled my tautology with my humanistic morality! So I will devote a few sentences to describing that. When I subscribe to my morality, there are a few arguments that I must make. Firstly, that life is different from all other forms of existence. It grows, and self-propagates, and occasionally has sentience. The second argument is that God created it. Just kidding. The second is that goodness in life is directly related to appreciation of existence. This can be on a large or small scale, and entails awareness, understanding, and love of this aforementioned existence that we all share. I think that's what happiness is.

So what can I derive from that? A good deed is one which helps a living being to appreciate existence or some part of it. A bad deed is that which works against appreciation, awareness, understanding, or love. Lying, cheating, theft, murder, hatred; all bad. Note that you can commit good and bad deeds to yourself.

I think that communication is the root of all good deeds, and the lack thereof is the root of all bad ones.

I also think that awareness is the most basic of the forms of appreciation of life, so the first step toward happiness is to remain aware of the universe that exists around us. If understanding is the next step in appreciation, then openmindedness and constant inquiry are also required for happiness. So what about love? If it is the ultimate step on the path to happiness, then I guess that's why they say it's so great.

There are trillions of living cells in the human body. They do not have nervous systems or sense organs with which they could experience the outside world in the same way as we can.

Regardless, how can we know for certain that our cells are not conscious? What is the requirement for consciousness, a sufficiently complex network of brain cells? Consciousness need not be the same thing as recognizing yourself in a mirror. It does not require analytical reasoning to ""feel alive"" and to have experiences. Being conscious in the present moment does not benefit from having memories from the past, or planning for the future. Consciousness in its most basic form might be a common feature of all lifeforms.

What then could be the experience of, say, a muscle cell? It doesn't see, taste, think or feel as we do. It picks up nutrients from the bloodstream, receives oxygen from red blood cells, releases CO2 into the bloodstream, receives commands from nerve cells and is directly connected to its neighboring muscle and bone cells. It may not make independent decisions on anything, but maybe it has the ability to at least experience its own functions and maybe even be aware (by its dependence of other cells) that it's a part of some bigger entity, an incredibly complex ecosystem of different cells?

 The ancient Egyptians believed that after somebody died, their heart was given to Orisis and weighed against the white feather of Ma'at or the ""Feather of Truth"". If that person's heart was weighed down by the wrongdoings they committed in their life, they would go to hell, and if the heart was lighter than Ma'at's feather, they would go to heaven.


**Now here is my sudden realization about this idea:**

The theoretical ""weight"" of Ma'at's feather is the amount of leeway you had, or the amount of sins you could do in your mortal lifetime and still get into heaven. So if one was to somehow be able to weigh Ma'at's feather, and also find out the weight of each sin that he were to do, he would be in control of his entrance into heaven.

So individuals who claim they can get somebody to heaven, in reality, are just pretending to have weighed Ma'at's feather.",,False,,t5_2s5se,False,,,True,t3_193rao,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/193rao/thoughts_on_egyptian_mythology_and_the_feather_of/,

But not like the religious level heaven/hell, or good/evil... way beyond that. I think that because of the state, location, etc., of every molecule at every location in the universe, those molecules will interact in a very precise way. Everything boils down to chemical reactions, electron movement, and forces that we both can understand and that we cannot yet understand. So therefor I also think that if the universe was restarted from scratch, but the exact same way it was the first time, that everything would happen as it has already happened, and as it is destined to happen.

This isn't to say that we're not conscious beings. We can still think, perceive, and comprehend. But the way we do each of these things is determined by our brain. Our brain is something though; a very specific composition of molecules, electrons, etc.. Therefor, our thought process is predestined, too. Plus, this brain has an origin from our parents, who's decision to have a kid was determined from their brain. It's an endless cycle which takes everything back to the beginning of existence.

Here is an example, although it doesn't capture the idea perfectly. Set up a pool table the exact same way. Hit the cue ball from the same location with the same exact power. Ignoring any wear on the equipment, the balls will end up in the same location every time (except that you can't do this as ""trials"", because each trial effects the next one by changing the arrangement of the molecules in the universe).

The compliment to this would be that I don't believe in true randomness.

My bros think this thought process is just a scapegoat. It's not like I look at everything as pointless or that I don't have choices in life. I'm also a nihilist. But they think that submitting to this idea gives up your humanity, your conscious, and the point of life. I'm still a happy person thinking this, and it doesn't change my reason for living.

Monkeys are not able to understand complex things like how big the universe is, how the world works, how the economy works, etc. We are only a little different than them, and look at us. We flew to the freakin' Moon. To me that's unbelievable.

But eventually we are going to reach the limit of our intelligence, like how we helped the monkeys do. We are eventually going to reach a giant wall that no one from our species can climb.

But maybe someone from another species can climb this wall. A species that is atleast 1% more advanced than us. They could be capable of things we will literally never understand no matter how hard we try.

Our galaxy is so big, there is probably a species like that out there right now. We think we're so smart with our touchscreens and hi-tech computers, but the stuff those guys do would seem like magic to us. We are just monkeys to them.

And so are they. They are monkeys to another species, a more hi-tech one. And even that other species would seem like monkeys to the more advance species. That's only a 3% difference in DNA from us.

What if you were the only REAL person in the world. Everyone else was just some kind of imitation or fake, but were representatives of real people (more on this later). You live a normal life. You talk to people everyday and they talk back and everyone is normal and everyone has a good time. Except, they're not normal. They're not even real. You are the only real person in the whole universe. It's all in your head.

Think of it as a video game. You play the campaign through 1 of maybe 3 or 4 characters. You choose the one that best suits you. So you're playing the game, and it's a really good game, too. You meet a bunch of great characters on the way, they feel so real it's as if they actually were. But you know they are not. The story is amazing, it allows you to do anything you want to do. You can either rule the whole world, or just live as a peaceful farmer in the countryside, it's all your choice. Eventually the game will end. You will get your stats at the end, showing how happy you are, how happy you made the other people, your positive or negative influence on the world, and so on. What you didn't realize is that there is a little surprise at the end of the game. If you played with an overall negative score, the game would freeze up your computer and your steam, psn, or xbox live account would get deleted or whatever. However, if you finish the game with a positive score, you unlock a bonus level. A level where you can do even more than what the game previously led you to think. You can fly into space, have magic powers, control the NPCs to do whatever you want, literally anything.

That's how life is. You could do whatever you want, be whatever you want, anything, but at the end it all depends on your score.

Now, the characters you meet in game which you thought are fake actually represent real people. They are just in a different ""game"". Perhaps you like RPGs but the other person likes FPSs. You will appear in the other person's game as maybe an army general or something, and the person will appear in your world as a local merchant. Their personalities in both games are exactly the same, it's just that the ""game"" is different to suit other people.

What if everyone if us is in the best world possible? Maybe your life works best in a FPS RPG style, such as Fallout, so that's why you are in this world right now. Your mom is still your mom, and your sister is still your sister, they're just in different games.

The bonus level/ account deletion part is like the afterlife, after your ""game"". In the ""bonus level"" all the main characters of every game are there (if they have a positive score). Now your mom is actually your mom, your sister is actually your sister, and they are exactly as how you remember them.

The account deletion is a way to weed out the bad people of the world. They are gone from existence forever (but I guess if your in the bonus level you can somehow wish for a representative NPC of that character).

Maybe this is how life goes. Think about it.",,False,,t5_2s5se,False,,,True,t3_16lyyf,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/16lyyf/worlds_combined/,

When your whole life flashes before your eyes you know that you have treated others well, made them happy and generally led a good life etc. So when your Floating towards the light at the end of the tunnel you can think the last thought you'll ever have to yourself.

 ""yea. I did alright. i may not have changed the world but i made people happy, people loved me and i loved them too.""

Heaven? Because then you can pass away happy knowing you did your best and made people happy in the short time you were on this planet.

But, if you're on your death bed and your last thought to yourself is,

""oh... i was an arse my whole life, i never really cared for any one else and i made people unhappy! shit i wanna change it, i wanna go back and say I'm sorry and make the people who i upset smile!! but i can't.... coz I'm dying.. fuck""

Hell? Because you left it too late to realize happiness isn't just about yourself but the others around you, and you leave this world with the feeling of regret and that's the last feeling you will ever feel.

I have no idea if this is part of some religion already but it has been floating in my head for a while. Also i don't know if this belongs here but i didn't really wanna post in /atheism coz they take things a bit too seriously, so i thought I'd share it with you guys instead.

The brain operating system has to reboot every time an absurdity or logic error crashes the main consciousness software. 

During the reboot, you have to relive your entire life in a single moment, which is why we spaz out for a couple seconds. We're living in super fast forward for that moment. 

Most of the time you don't realize this is happening, but when you completely open your mind to observation, then you can see your own thoughts like Matrix Code.

Marijuana is the red pill. Sort of like virus of the mind -- a trojan horse that allows you to hijack your own brain using stack overflows, brute force, etc. However, pot is a very ineffective red pill. The brain is built to automatically fix up any logical incongruities, and will do so as soon as it can. This is the process of sobering up.

Any ideas that do not get ""corrected"" before the brain patches up the bug, become part of that persons real ideas and beliefs.

Schizophrenia is when someone has completely gone inside their own consciousness and their brain was unable to recover and rebuilt the logical circuitry. Full blown mind AIDS.

Enlightenment is free, unrestricted passage between consciousness and subconsciousness. This does not destroy the ego, but rather creates a meta-ego. A set of all sets, or ego of all egos, so to speak.

This is where [Russell's Paradox](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/gatnr/can_someone_explain_russells_paradox/) comes into play. A *set of all-sets-that-don't include-themselves* is just another way of saying death and void. Because the set of all sets that do include themselves is enlightenment and life.

So death must necessarily include life. But not the other way around, as humanity has been falsely assuming this whole time.

Submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society, I call this dream... 

----

**Snack White**

I was at a swimming pool in an experimental mental hospital (it was a rather long dream that didn't begin at this point, I'm just picking up here).

After swimming, I went to dry myself off in a shack next to the pool. A sort of communal area, where the lifeguard apparently watches us via security cam, though he wasn't there for some reason. 

On the old CRT television (security monitor?) was musician Jack White from The White Stripes swimming, though it seemed more like a small lake than the pool I was just in.

After a short moment, I realized he was actually being attacked by crocodile. But he wasn't making any signs of a struggle. He was just singing a haunting song as the crocodile kept biting on him. Not a full song, just a single stanza he kept repeating over and over in a distinct, non-screechy emo voice I can still hear. It didn't sound anything like his normal voice. Just a dull, flat style... almost as if he was bored.

I can't remember the line, but it was about 10 or so words ending with ""wiiiiith yooooou"".

The camera was very close up and graphic. But he lasted quite a while. Singing for at least a minute. No sounds or other obvious expressions of physical pain. The croc was strangely calm, not in any sort of typical feeding frenzy. Just taking its time, crushing and shredding him in slow bites.

 It started off with him sort of kneeling down in the croc's mouth, facing outward towards the camera, away from the croc's throat. Being continually and slowly crunched in slow bites. Eventually his legs were in the croc's throat, and the only thing visible was his head and upper torso, as if he was trying to crawl out of the croc's throat. Though he obviously wasn't trying. 

Clearly this was some kind of weird suicidal performance art.

He was singing until the very end. Finally the croc began crunching him for good. While bringing him underwater (which the camera followed).  I couldn't tell if he was dead before he was finally swallowed, but as he was being crunched, he let out a strange squeeling that seemed more like the body's natural reaction than any sort of intentional expression of pain. Or maybe something like the sound of air being violently forced out of his lungs.

It was all extremely graphic and seemed very realistic. Though I've never seen anything like that in real life.

Suddenly and without any explanation, the television feed cut to a local news story about traffic at night. The reporter wasn't talking at all though. There wasn't even a reporter on the screen. It was just footage of the sparse trickle of cars moving up and down a dark two-way street. There were no car accidents, no traffic congestion, nothing of any significance to report. They were just showing boring, normal traffic for some reason. And without any mention of the suicide footage we had just seen.

Our ape bodies are fallible and clumsy, our brains clouded by rationalization; we experience pain, boredom, sadness, intense fear, mental disease and biological death. The only way to remove these shortcomings of chemical life is to do one thing: upload our consciousness to computers/robots/AI/whatever you'd like to call it. That, or massive genetic alteration, would be the way to rid ourselves of our flaws while retaining the things we like.

We'll be able to customize our existence, our emotions (if we have any), our entire experience as beings. We will be immortal. Pain, depression, medical conditions, *even death* will be nonexistent. Memory would be perfect, our reasoning would be perfectly logical. The only downside is that we won't retain our *humanity*; but we only see that as a downside at the moment because we *are* human, and our brains are programmed to feel uneasy about our relative inexistence by replacement with robotic beings.

If our future computational beings do have emotions, we will be programmed to feel exclusively good emotion, our entire existence being nothing but an exquisite pleasure. Bad emotion would be a totally alien concept to a sentient being that couldn't experience such a thing.

If we don't have emotions, we will realize that existence is truly pointless; as we cannot experience good or bad in our emotionless minds, inexistence will be the logical choice. Again, our human selves recoil at the thought of this; death is inherently scary and wrong to us. But to robots, death is just inexistence; pain and fear are not there to stop them from these thoughts. As there is simply no reason to stick around, we will pop out of existence without care, pain or regret to prevent us from doing so.

These are my thoughts on humanity's endgame. Our continued existence from the posthuman perspective rests on whether or not we build our future brains with emotion, or pure cold-hearted reason. My hope is that we have emotion; but a mere ape would think such a thing.

Tl;dr we will become robots, if we have emotions, we'll be living an immortal life of unthinkable pleasure. If we don't, we'll all kill ourselves.",,False,,t5_2s5se,False,,,True,t3_175w58,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/175w58/whats_the_goal_what_is_humanitys_endgame/,

",Lack_of_Dissonance,8,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/16mwvk/westboro_baptist_church_the_dark_socrates_or_how/,"We live in a world of division.  Whether it be the wars and rioting in the Middle East or the fence between the USA and Mexico, there is very little wiggle room for the space in-between.  Those living in the USA must deal with a government seemingly unable to work outside of party doctrines; therefore, leaving the nation to stagnate.  Couple this with a ""with-us-or-against-us"" mentality as well as a predisposition to hyperbolically label everything as a war, and you have the makings for an uncomfortable impasse.  How can anyone in this situation find common ground?

Enter Westboro Baptist Church.  A group built on vile rhetoric and the Christian Bible.  The distressed atheist part of me wants to chalk their actions up to a lack of critical thinking and upbringing, but the philosopher part of me wants to analyze it, wants to know ""why?""  I found the answer can be explained with comics and related media.  Specifically the Alan Moore comic, ""Watchmen"" and the recent Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight.""

In ""Watchmen"" the character Ozymandias, an incredible intellect, possibly the smartest person in the fictional setting, sees a problem in world similar to one the one addressed here.  He sees a world that needs uniting, echoing the aspirations of his hero Alexander the Great.  His solution is an engineered set of events that would like an extraterrestrial invasion that kills millions, thus creating a world-wide catastrophe uniting all inhabiting Earth against a common enemy.  Perhaps extreme, and, luckily, only a story.  Batman has something in common with Ozymandias.

In the movie ""The Dark Knight"" we see this idea of uniting against a common enemy with one of the most quoted section towards the end of the film.  Batman is worried that a politician's ruined reputation will undue the good done by said politician.  Batman then decides to take on the sins of the politician; therefore, becoming a villain in the eyes of the same people he seeks to protect.  The citizens of Gotham City will unite against Batman, but they will be one and he can take it anyway.  This brings things around the point:  Westboro Baptist Church.

""God Hates Fags"" and ""God Hates Soldiers"" both seem like the close-minded rants of anger born of ignorance.  According to Occam's Razor, this is the case.  With more time and the correct medication a gleam of something else begs exploration.  With further evidence, I must question the group's hate and ignorance - at least a little bit.

Westboro Baptist Church, as an organization, conducts operations far more intelligently than many would like to acknowledge, but they are very cunning.  Much of what they say, no matter how horrible, is protected by the U.S. Constitution and safeguarded by the court system.  Time and time again people have tried to quiet the group, oftentimes resorting to less than legal means to do so.  Every time the group's civil rights are violated, they go to court.  They have members well versed in the U.S. Constitution and laws.  They utilize this knowledge in court winning case after case filling their coffers with the awards.  If they are smart enough to continually win in court, how smart are they really?  How could they be so intelligent and ignorant at the same time?  I realize one can be smart and ignorant at the same time and perhaps my questions beg more than a dog for bacon.  Due to the nature of the subreddit - they stand for the purpose of experimentation.

One more questionable question:  Is the Westboro Baptist Church working out of love or hatred?  Their actions and words reek of hatred.  They shout and sing things deemed unacceptable to the society that is home to the church. Yet they follow the Christian Bible to the word.  They are able to back up their beliefs with citations.  They do what they believe God has told them to do.  There is some contraindication between Westboro Baptist Church and what Jesus purportedly  preached to the masses.  How do they reconcile their words and those of Jesus?

What is the commonality between the KKK, bikers, hackers, religious groups from all major religions, veterans and every combination of those groups plus a few more to boot?  They have stood up against Westboro Baptist Church.  They have lined up in front of funerals and made public denouncements against the group.  These groups are united under a common enemy.  Through hatred, Westboro Baptist Church has brought unity.
 
Perhaps Westboro Baptist Church is the hero the USA deserves.  Perhaps they engineered themselves to be a giant space alien. It is entirely possible they are Socratic masterminds doomed to be hated for bringing light to a dark situation. Probably not, but whatever their intentions, they have brought together a rather motley group.

Life is an accident, a freak of nature. Humans were lucky to gain intelligence and now we are doomed with the knowledge that we will all someday die here on this rock. The meaning of human life is simply to reproduce, the same as every other living thing.

But maybe the universe created life as a means for its own reproduction. [Neuron connections in the brain look very similar to the structure of our universe](http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/pc/neuron-galaxy.jpg). If there is a universe in every brain, then when brain-owners reproduce a new universe is born. Perhaps the universe made humans intelligent so we would understand what it has accomplished and we could figure out a way to keep life going when the inevitable happens and this rock we’re on is destroyed.

Because ideas are what makes life worth living. It's ideas that have made everything we have possible. Without them we would have absolutely nothing. And I mean nothing. We'd basically be mindless zombies doing nothing with our lives. Think of it like this, our mouths have a ""filter"", our brains don't. 

A little background on me. Growing up, I was a night owl. Up at weird times of the night and I can't speak for everyone. But for the most part, the best ideas/conversations happen at these times. Atleast I think so. I've always been a philosophical thinker, I think. 

So this morning as I laid in bed, tossing and turning, a thought pulled into my brain station. Well it's been on my mind for awhile now. We'll call it ""the big picture."" And some of you have probably written me off at this point, but thanks for those who stay. You won't be disapppinted. 

But I digress back to the big picture. It's not something that you believe, or do, or even completely wrap your head around. It's an idea. Something to entertain the brain with. Or the soul if you believe in that. (More background, not sure if necessary, but I couldn't describe my religion if I had to. I'm not atheist or Baptist, Catholic, or what else you may follow. I'm not discrediting any of those.) 

Trying to stay on track here, sleeps trying to kick in. Ideas though. Let me tie my points together. Between the big picture and ideas. Our souls. I'd say we are all conscious beings. Most of us. Some of us though are really conscious though. I feel atleast. (People say I'm way to smart most of the time. I know that and feel it) 

But this idea is right on the edge of my minds horizon. I can see it, feel it, and almost touch it. So where do these ideas come from? The good, the bad, the neutral? And why do people have different ideas. I may have a pile of legos in front of me and build a house with a working elevator. You however, could build anything. A planet, a car, a treehouse. So my question of the idea of the big picture is no longer just, ""Why are we here?"" But ""Why are we different?"" 

Another way to think of this is say we are created from a mold, why is my mold different from yours. This is really just turning into me rambling now. But there is something here. I'd love to discuss any of this.

As animals, our prime directives have been survival and reproduction - it is these actions that have allowed for us to flourish the planet, and nature favors species that can excel in these actions. Survival and reproduction are simply at the core of all other actions we take, and the actions we take that go against these are usually signs of mental illness (but that in itself can be it's own discussion - this post isn't really meant to address that issue as much).

To facilitate these basic tasks, humans developed language. Language allows us to form common conceptualizations of aspects of our world, and communicate them with others - a much better form of communication as compared to grunts and vague gestures. We can imbibe upon others certain information of which they have no first hand knowledge to a very high degree of accuracy. 

Spoken and written language has allowed us to communicate with an unprecedented degree of accuracy to our intended point. And the evolution of language has seen the growth of the exploitation of language - metaphors for example express concepts that ordinary language would find difficult despite expressing an specific felt mental/emotional state and/or aspect of specific material knowledge.

With this, comes conceptualization of abstract concepts. Abstracts by definition do not truly exist, especially in our physical world. Yet we can discuss them in a like manner to how we discuss what exists in our real world. Abstracts concepts *do* exist in the mind (or otherwise we could not and would not discuss them), and language facilitates the discussion of these abstract concepts (or perhaps made these abstract concepts of the mind possible in the first place, though I tend to believe it was the former).

As we have seen, language is not intrinsic to our world - many animals that, even if they *do* communicate, only communicate basic ideas - danger, food, etc. - and there is no inherent ""meaning"" to language - animals without a spoken language can survive well enough without it. Animals lack the ability to communicate concepts as well as humans can with language.

With this also comes interesting looks at the evolution of language and communication. Language has evolved in complexity, allowing us to express ideas that are completely removed from our physical reality and carry unique subtleties. Will future technologies allow us to have more precise communication? Brain to brain ""communication"", devoid of the limitations of our current language, may allow us, in the future, to more accurately express concepts and ideas with one another.",,False,,t5_2s5se,False,,,True,t3_1dnyoq,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/1dnyoq/abstract_concepts_and_language_conceptualization/,

I mean, if we accept the notion that souls actually do exist, that races the question; are we all capable of creating and harnessing a soul? 
When does the soul emerge in the fetus? Is it the act of conception, the forming of the zygote or in the testicles? Do the father and mother provide equal amounts of soul to the baby?
What we have to agree on is that souls, if they exist, are complex. Complex to the degree that they are you. Your soul is the software for which your body is the hardware. You are your own little parasite. 
But when does the soul actually form? If every sperm has a soul that means that most men produces and kills millions of souls every day. If they are complex in nature then the building process is complex. But isn't that too much of a waste if that was the case? Evolution wouldn't let that much potential just go to waste.

Let's introduce magic to the playing field; souls are pieces of the universes identity. Then do males practice magic every day by creating it? What if souls only form during the actual connection between the sperm and the egg? Would that mean that a test-tube baby has no soul? Are all ginger-kids actually test-tube babies? 
Could we extract the ""glands"" in humans that produces souls and then create super-souls?  Maybe that's how God was created. An ancient hyper-intelligent society who learned how to harness natures' own power of producing souls and created the ultimate soul, with the power to withhold lives within itself. And that was the birth of our microverse, inside the ""real"" universe which could very well be the infinite regression of societies and universes, all harnessing the power to create a power grander than all else, to the point where the regression meets up with itself and bonds, thus meaning that we're creating ourselves. We, in our universe, in what we call ""the cosmos"" are the last link for that circle to be complete. Cause what happens when a society has the power to manufacture life? War happens. To the extent that the only living thing in the end of it will be the very super soul that indirectly devoured them by their own stupidity. So what we'll get is a circle of infinite regressing super souls in ruined societies who'll try to build their own, with their set of rules and laws. The only common denominator between them all is our free will. And I've come to doubt that very concept has ever really been real. 

No sorry, I do not accept the notion of the soul. Not as something physical that every person has within them. On a metaphorical level, sure. But I've been firing none-beams of light for half of an infinity in my metaphors so that doesn't really say much I'm afraid.

Only pure indifference, peacefulness and acceptance from that person will set you free to make sure that your actions aren't tied to constraints of guilt or pity. Yet indifference means also absent of care, it means that your connection with their being is as strong as the force that ties you with a planet orbiting any other star. Negligible. 

Yet we humans, we seem to want both. Or at least, we fluctuate, swing back and forth like a pendulum. We want both the loyalty and the lack of responsibility. We want both their desperation and their ability to pursue their own fulfillment.

What's the real difference between breaking down barriers and overstepping bounds? When are you crossing the line and when are you giving up too early? What indicators are you using? It can't be common sense. When was common sense ever the answer? The sense that is so common is the weakest compromise between both. People don't dare to love nor do they dare to let go. Are we following our hearts? The biggest monsters in the world pursued their hearts and broke lives or even entire civilizations in their pursuits. 

No guidelines are written, it's not thought in schools, nature has it's own atrocities, even the stars stay silent in this universal question.

The world's misery is filled with people that went too far or never went far enough. The ultimate grief comes from not knowing what you can change as well as not changing what you could out of mere caution.

To remedy this, what if we wrote a eulogy for each of our loved ones before they died, and then shared it with them.

There are some grim implications to this proposition, but they can be mitigated. Perhaps, after writing down a eulogy, you could distill the bullet points from it and ask yourself, ""Does my loved one know that I think this highly of them?"" For example, if you think your best friend is a really good listener, would they know that?

Then, instead of telling them outright, which could be awkward, you could drop hits every now and then or randomly mention the compliment in passing. People tend to cling onto such poignant lauds, even if uttered in a casual manner, and they have the possibility of changing the whole dynamic of your relationship.

Perhaps this should be the real ""bucket list:"" drop hints to everybody you know about the high esteem you really hold them in.

Life would be so peaceful if people out there instead of focusing on the troubles of the material world aimed at the spiritual life willing to evolve, to improve thyself, to be a creature that loves every being boundlessly without prejudice like jesus, buddha, ghandi, mother theresa and many others did, after all that's the final destination everybody, to be perfect morally. And they were in this planet to set an example of how to be

So forget about your troubles around here because everything is imparmanent no matter how big are your problems or your fortune is, the only thing you're taking out of this existence is the spiritual evolution/chiseling youre going to have the opportunity to obtain during this life, everything else besides that will stay.

Every trouble youre facing right now is a door to surrender and to overcome these obstacles and become a whole person, an impacient family member is there to teach you to have patience, an angry colleague is there setting an example of how no to be, a vain person is also setting an example of what brings pain into life by attaching self value to the body appearence. Your enemy is your teacher, he is there to teach you something, no one is in your life for mere randomness, it was all designed so you could have the opportunity to learn with those people, either by acquiring their good characteritics or removing from you the bad morals you see in the other.

Materiality is a veil that occults behind it the true purpose of life and existence which is not in this world, but in the other, ethereal one.

I feel sorry for atheists, beliving that this tremendous amount of inteligence and synchronicity in the universe and nature is pure randomness and that life is a single opportunity and after it the person will 'live' in the eternal void where nothing exists is such a self constraining idea that can only lead to depression and an empty earthly existence.

Watched over a friend while he tripped here's how he described it afterwards, (just wants to share).",Littlef00t,9,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/18ai26/inc_textwall_watched_over_a_friend_while_he/,"What I Experienced 
After Smoking What Was Supposedly 7H Hydro, or ""fake bake"".

Very little remains concrete in details. I remember ingesting the 7H, in a tiny pipe, two hits, fairly deep breaths, holding it in my lungs, I think. According to the others there, I said the first syllable of one person's name, fell to my knees, and the side of my head hit a heater, hard. I don't actually remember any of that happening, not one bit. Supposedly at that point I was shivering, shaking, one could almost say ""convulsing"". I was babbling nonsense, definitely not in my right mind. I clearly had no control over my body or my mind, trapped in my thoughts as I was. As I was waking up, the only thought that crossed my mind was, ""Holy shit, holy shit, holy fucking shit..."", etc., amidst essentially uncontrollable laughter. What went on inside my head was far different from what went on outside. I had gone from a closet in one room to a bed in another, with no recollection of how I'd gotten there, or where my glasses went. I was waking up and being told my name, that I was okay, that I was apparently having trouble breathing, something was said about asthma, and there was apparently a lot of laughter involved. I will repeat what I said. ""Holy Fucking Shit.""

What Was Going On Inside My Mind.

Obviously, to explain to any exact degree what I experienced would be almost impossible. I'm certain it's something that's different for everyone. There were two main facets to it though, with which I was most familiar. One, there was an indescribable scene which was unspeakably familiar, kind of like the most intense deja vu possible, and I thought to myself, simply, ""Holy shit this is familiar"". The second part of what I experienced I will try to describe as seeing the operations of my mind on the most microscopic of scales. It's almost like that static you see on a TV switched to the wrong channel, but not quite. It was darker, much darker. The white particles were moving in a kind of organized chaos, and I was one with the chaos, and it was me. To be, to exist, yadda yadda. Throughout the entirety of witnessing these tiny particles, which I like to think were the electronic impulses of my brain's circuits all firing as they are wont to do, there was a kind of susurrus, a flowing and vague noise. It was very consistent, a kind of rapid flowing followed by a slower flowing, rapid, slower, rapid, slower. I assume that it was the sound of the blood flowing around my brain, timed to my heartbeats, as that's the only way I can really explain it. It wasn't so much an ""out of body"" experience as simply my consciousness shrinking down to the smallest possible scale. I couldn't form a conscious thought, I couldn't form a word, a thought, an idea, an image, anything. It was just microscopic electrical impulses firing and flowing, I think in patterns that were circular, horizontal, vertical, diagonal, and falling to the side. During one part of it I had a vague sense of panic, that I had no control over what was going on, after which I just relaxed a bit and let what happened happen. I had absolutely no control over anything, except to just experience it for what it was. Towards the end of it there was a fragment of a memory, of an experience, something almost real to hold onto, to latch onto, to anchor my consciousness to, and of course it's difficult to describe. It was like a breath of air approaching a doorway, and beyond the doorway was the vague sense of a fireplace or a hearth. It repeated a few times, and it seemed like the whole thing was finally starting to slow down, to abate, but I was still lost in my mind. I think this was when the effects were finally starting to wear off. I was only aware in the smallest sense that my hands were over my mouth, each finger causing something to happen. For a while I thought of myself as a genius-like twelve-year-old, using my mind as a kind of scientific experiment to observe the inner workings of the mind from a first-person perspective. I thought of myself as though I must've looked cherubic, innocent, with a look of wonder on my eyes, unable to stop smiling, to stop laughing. It was as though each tip of my finger had extended around an infinite sphere of space, becoming infinitesimally small streams of electrical information, all overlapping and merging with one another, forming everything that was my brain, my thoughts, my consciousness, my being, etc. I was of course assured in my mind that what I experienced was true reality, was seeing my brain at the simplest scale of lights on and off, an equivalent of zeros and ones, all somehow working with each other, against each other, around each other, making up me. As I slowly opened my eyes and noticed someone talking to me, and was able to decipher words again, I still felt the rapid then slower flowing of the blood around my brain, the indistinct white noise, a kind of loud whisper. If I concentrate I can still hear the loud whisper. There was no clear feeling of euphoria, of anxiety, depression, panic, addiction, or really anything. I guess I was kind of relieved it was all over, but not in an intensely satisfactory manner. I had thought that what I experienced was extremely intriguing, but little else.

We are all slightly amazed for whatever reason when one user just receives free reddit gold from another anonymous user. At least amazed enough to edit our comments and say thanks! Well, what if it is just one person out there gifting all this gold, making him feel like a god amongst men, men who merely get to ""upvote"" something they like, whereas he gets to give gold to something he likes and just really make that person's day enough that the person gets a little jolt of happiness?

Why do we like getting upvotes? Because it makes our point or joke validated. We like when we get hundreds of upvotes because it makes us think wow, I must be cool/smart/real. Not a bad thing or anything. This dark knight, this vigilante of upvoters is giving us a higher-grade feeling of validation.

What if this dark knight is the ultimate caring person and is trying to single-handedly make the world a better place by making someone else truly happy for just the littlest of time? The more people experience that, the more they themselves are going to pass that along and return the favor for someone else, thus spreading overall well-being and peace amongst the world. In what other way can we directly influence someone at a core level yet in such a worldwide, widespread way?

Perhaps it is a government-controlled initiative, in that it gifts gold to comments that it wishes to be the popular opinion of the union. We all know that a good comment/argument on reddit often can sway our opinions in certain directions. And then we thus upvote it. The more upvotes it has, the more visible it is. Gold boosts visibility. 

What better way to get a posted opinion rolling to become the most popular one than reddit gold? What lace to do it better than reddit? I don't know of anywhere else that such mass opinions are reached that range the broadest of subjects. Sure there are larger online communities, and others that have more in-depth conversations than here, but they may be limited to a specific subject matter. ""Reddit"" has something for the masses. There is literally a subreddit to discuss *anything*.

TL:DR: Reddit is a powerful tool for spreading opinions and information. Those who give reddit gold are among the most powerful of those shaping the opinions and information that is spread.

I mean, I'll admit, I would love to live in the world of Pokemon. I assume many of you would, too. But, at the same time, there are obvious reasons why anyone wouldn't want to live in a reality other than there own.

Nevertheless, I began to take a look at the endless amounts of fiction in our world. Think about this - there are more fictional worlds than there are real worlds, as far as we know. Assuming that there are no parallel universes, that this universe is indeed the only universe or dimension that exists (and by dimension I mean other realities, not dimensions like length or width or time), then there are millions of fictional universes created by humanity as opposed to the one reality that humanity exists in.

But, then let us assume that there are alternate universes, an infinite amount. With an infinite amount of alternate realities, that means that any kind of fictional world that we humans have thought up are possible, and all their variations are equally as possible.

Just think about our reality for an example, then slight variations of it. Look at a piece of furniture. If there are indeed an infinite amount of alternate universes, there could very well be a universe that mirrors our reality exactly, except that that piece of furniture is a different color. That may be the only difference, but that in it of itself is a different reality.

Getting back to my original point...this got me thinking. If there is the possibility of alternate universes, then it very well could be that all of humanity's created fictional works exist in actual alternate realities, and all variations of those realities too exist. Ash could really be on his journey to become a Pokemon Master right now...and, indeed, another Ash could be doing the same thing but maybe he has a scar on his back...and another Ash and another Ash and another Ash...and then all the limitless differences that could create infinite variations of minute differences between these realities. There could be endless slight variations creating different alternate realities, so try to fathom when these realities have larger differences!

I am not assuming that our human minds are ""creating"" alternate realities, but that our creations in our mind, which then may be represented in film, art, video games, literature, and all the above, could actually exist as alternate realities.

We think that as you move further away from earth we will eventually reach other galaxies etc. But in what direction are these? Is our solar system in the middle with thinks both above and below us as well as further away in a 2 dimensional sense? Do we orbit the sun flat? Do other planets orbit on a different axis? How have we been able to navigate to other planets if they do orbit on a different axis to us? 

I find the concept of the universe makes far more sense if it's actually 2  dimensional. Like if it was a cricket field and we are only able to move along the one plane (I think that is actually apart of a multiverse theory).

Side note: There is considered to be a ""Habitable"" zone in which the earth sits. With the Millions of other planets and stars out there odds are there must be another one with similar or the exact same conditions as earth. Does this mean that ""aliens"" could be genetically the same as us assuming they developed in the same conditions we did? Obviously they could be more or less evolved/technologically developed.

Since they think that the Sun is slowly shrinking could this mean that planets further out in our solar system were once in this zone? Maybe as it's shrunk Mar's was the last planet in this zone and this explains the ""riverbeds"" NASA has observed there. Could it have once been in the same condition as Earth but now is outside the zone.

IMHO..The Large Hadron Collider is one of the biggest waste of money, energy and intelligence in the history of science. Even-smaller particles! WOW!.. who cares?! what difference does that make? The more they'll look, the smaller particles they'll find.


Science is a great tool! But how about integrating the breakthroughs into everyone's lives and not just leave it for the elites to pat themselves on the shoulder for some completely abstract notion that was confirmed.


How about investing more in the scientific research of the human psychology and therapy? This could potentially alleviate aberrant behavior such as obesity, rape, crime, drug-addiction, teenage pregnancy that affects EVERYONE's lives.


How about investing more in methods of feeding the poor of the world in a self-sustainable way? (Not with burgers and coca-cola)

How about investing more in how to desalt ocean water so that nobody has to PAY for it on a planet with 70% water. (WTF?!)


""The secrets of the Universe were unlocked!"", ""The God particle was discovered!"" 
Grando-maniac statements that make NO difference in your life, yet you feel like you have to be excited and enthusiastic about it. But you need Scientists to explain you what it actually even means. And after you find out, you're like ""Meh...whatever, who's hungry?""


The secrets of the Universe should NOT be mediated by anyone! Otherwise it starts being fishy and smelling like religion.


They compare this with the Newton's discovery of gravity and Einstein's relativity theories. The difference is that those were just some really smart guys, who only wasted paper for their achievements (not $9 BILLION, in times of recession) . And their conclusions actually enlightened everyone who heard about them, without much hassle.

1) Preface:

TL;DR *We had a lot of imaginary money during the housing bubble, then it collapsed, and we realized the money was imaginary.* go to 2)

As government aid programs stood at the turn of the century, the economy was booming on the housing bubble. We had more money in the economic system because more people were in debt for housing, and the debt was assumed to be good. Then when we (meaning banks, meaning the government to fund the war?) tried to collect on those debts, there wasn't enough money to be had. Hence the economic crash when the housing bubble collapsed.

TL;DR: *we hosted ourselves by our own petards*

**2)** We had more money to spend from the bubble, so some of it went to social aid programs. Now that the bubble is gone, some of that money goes to leeches. Don't get me wrong, money being in the hands of the needy is a good thing. People who need help get a hand up. The fact is that we increased funding to the social aid programs when we had wealth as a nation, and when the economic tide turned, people realized they could hook into the aid system to keep themselves well off financially. We need to find a way to scrap off the leeches while leaving those who truly need aid untouched.


TL;DR: *but by hoisting ourselves, we may have fucked ourselves?*

**3)** Because we were absolutely saturated with imaginary money from the bubble, corporations and the government invested frivolously. And then crunch time came. Slack for income, corporations went under or had to evolve to be leaner. Jobs are cut, millions left unemployed. Then they get on social aid, which further exacerbates the economy's financial problems. We dug our own grave, spending monopoly money on nuclear weapons, the military, pipes to Alaska, I'm sure you can think of more. We collectively shot ourselves in the foot by overspending. So now our government is overextending itself to protect us, propping up banks to save it's working-class citizens who barely make ends meet.

**4)** TL;DR: *Cut government spending? Yes we should, but it's intricate.*

So, is cutting government spending on other things a priority? Yes, but it's focused in the wrong areas. Spending should be cut in common-sense areas such as the war on drugs, and if we can prop up a successful government in the Middle East, we can pull out and bring our troops home. Not to say that doing so is easy. Everything is intricately tangled. 

**5)** TL;DR: *Trying to solve these problems could destabilize the economy, for better AND for worse...* 
Unfortunately, with the economy in a downturn, veterans would likely come back and have to look for jobs, crashing things even further. 
The problem is exactly the same as the drug war problem. If we gave up and let all the marijuana-related ""criminals"" in jail to walk free, they'd also join the unemployed and looking for work.

**6)** TL;DR: *We're eating our own tail, we need to figure something out.*
On the other hand, with the savings from effective governmental belt tightening, the economy would likely experience a rebound and perhaps new small businesses would spring up, become chains, and employ more people. We'd have to return more of our jobs from overseas and tighten laws about international corporations hiring across borders, which the corporations will fight tooth and claw to keep, because it lets them stay rich and perpetuate the cycle, instead of tightening their belts like everyone else.

**7)** TL;DR: *So what now?*

What can we do about it? Individually, not much. Maybe not enough. We may have shot ourselves somewhere more vital than our foot. However, the baby boomer generation is dying out. If we can vote in politicians who aren't covered in the slime that comes from working in that field, the  intelligent, the critical thinkers who may not have the best public face, we may have a chance. This is where Reddit comes in. A large portion of its demographic is those too young to vote, but close. Educate yourselves about your politicians' views, about whether they're hollow puppets for others or  critical thinkers who try to do the right thing.

Some people think votes don't matter anymore, and maybe they're right. Maybe we're owned by the corporations and the government, maybe we're too soaked in consumerism and advertisements and distractions and stupidity. Perhaps it's too late, and we're on fire, in a nosedive. But we have to do something to try to pull out of it.",,False,,t5_2s5se,False,,,True,t3_kbs4m,http://www.reddit.com/r/StonerPhilosophy/comments/kbs4m/america_the_snake_that_eats_its_tail/,

That grand old man casting his mystical spell over our crazy Western civilization... 

That the laws of physics are merely the lowest-grade dumb stuff, completely uninteresting in their banal simplicity, excepting a few mildly-interesting lifeless elegances in the fields of quantum electrodynamics. That this may as well be created by some sort of devil as a crude joke — ha, see here God, can you make anything cool out of *this* yucky goo? I mean, when you study physics seriously, zoom in to the real meat of the universe, delve in there by reduction, and when you get close enough and really see it for what it is — it's basically *nothingness*, vast expanses of empty space, beyond blackness or invisibility, beyond death, and a handful of rigidly specified movement calculi for abstract types of fields (the pastoral metaphor is mere flattery).

We are supposed to believe that this autistic soup is the heart of reality, the real essence. Everything is just various types of delusion, denigrating notions like ""emergence,"" suggesting that any interesting *logos* here actually derives from the chaos, was always there from the start, a 180 degree reversal of the obviously true situation.

Namely that there must exist, ontologically, a complexly immanent framework of structure, a large and beautiful organization of the causal relations, which is so dynamic in every dimension that it (and perhaps only it) truly deserves the name ""True Life"", ""Soul"", or ""God."" This living meta-structure includes everything, is everything, is the creative drive in every process, the working of cosmic reason, the word made flesh.

What, then, is faith? It is only the realization that one is nothing but a particle of God's plan, that the only absolutely true perspective is that of Spinoza's pantheism, and that the Spinozan identification of God as the Constantly-Creating Creativity in Nature is truly another equally valid conception of true monotheism, and that devotion and love is a pre-made attractor in the Field of Excellence, that Virtue is Identifiable as Strong Loving Life, the completely serene life, absolutely harmonious, yet incessantly working for all beings, the bodhisattva life.

Our codified stale ethics are unnecessary, they are second-rate emulations of the real thing, they are icon-sized thumbnails of true goodness, true justice, true love. This is why all great prophets are minimalists in ethics. They uncalcify, they cause withering trees to bloom. They bring peace and disruption: individual peace in the midst of social disruption. Nietzsche totally missed the arcane truth of Buddhism when he described the Buddha as a profet for a declining, decadent culture — or maybe we've missed the arcane truth of Nietzsche. He might have seen its Original Secret Plan, to install the trojan horse that keeps the truth alive, to bring God down through the darkening ages in a cloak of disguise, a kind of invisibility suit.

What, my friend, you do not believe the yogis of Northern India and the sages of Asian Mahayana were every bit as intelligent, discerning, skillful, and careful as you? 
You do not think they created a soul science, beyond the dualism of reason vs subjectivity, mind vs body, self vs others? You really think the transmission of Dharma could be anything but a Significant Substructure in the Dynamically Perfect Web of Action and Thought, or a Truly Magnetic Love between the Reflective Mind and the Wonderful Workings? Nahh! You need to sit down and meditate!

Just do it, right now. Drop your distance from the experience: you already are the Experiencer Behind Experience, the Original Face. Cut off all discursive thought; from this let your thoughts emerge in alignment with the true direction of reason: the Mysterious Origination of Consciousness from Chaos. But this is already the alignment; there is nothing you have to do. So just stop not doing it and a great faith will fill you; you will become faith itself.

If you find a True Master to guide you, a community alive with the Beating Dharma Heart, you have a failsafe vehicle for the Great Liberation. You are connected to a Sacred Map of Obscure Origin from the Buzzing Dharma Forests of the Axial Age, and with this you have a true guide to the Terrain of Transformation. The singular enlightenment is not an easy target, but you will find a true glimmer of hope in the feeling of Rising Soul, a trustily increasing Robustness of Divine Connection, a Higher Ground. This will be felt in your blood and deeply realized even when it is just that, a glimmer.

But to be just with Plato, which we must, we must clarify that the characterization or caricature of Matter as Evil or Stupid or Just Lumpy Stuff is in the deepest sense a compliment, a praise of Matter, a concealed praise of the Spirit behind Matter, the Spirit Coextensive With Matter, the Great Arbitrariness, the Hilarious Elegance. Yes indeed. Plato was a force of nature, and was never wrong; nobody is ever wrong, but Plato was Madly, Truly, Deeply, in Serious Love with the Logos, and this made even his Trivial Falsities into Great Miracles. Through realizing Not-Self in the Mystic Reason, old Plato realized his True Nature and then only sang the Song of Dharma, in his anciently perfect way.

You must realize that the Golden Dharma was Vividly Activated in the Birth-Miracles of both West and East. See, the myriad worlds of the Ten-Thousand Things are Seriously Difficult to Navigate, and the extent to which a Perfect Bodhisattva achieves Unifying Realization in the World-Field is usually quite limited compared to the Vastly Vast Confusion that is the Thorny Context, the Judas, the Desert Poverty, the Monastery, the Asceticism, the Cross. We must not blame the Bodhisattvas for the transience of their religions; there must be Calcification at some Radius of Multi-Dimensional Perfection. Bodhisattvas walk among you every day, all are prophets, in differing degrees. It is never obvious who are Manifestations of the Truly Long-Term Dharma Plan of Immense Paradise. The Kingdom of God is truly within us; the Body of Christ is certainly Present in the Churches; the Tathagathagarba Seed of Buddhahood is our Core Essence; Enlightenment is Right Here Right Now more Vividly Present than Anything Else; but this is Crazily Conceived to only in the Ultimately Final Plan become Completely Permeating; any Religion that needs to claim Perfection is Obviously Operating in a Context of Confused Concepts.

So, my friends, from what I have seen, I must implore you with the most Thundering Enthusiasm, that you Work-Up the Chops and Chutzpah to Truly Integrate, Concentrate, and Penetrate Truth. This cannot be done while the Glitzy Distortion of Softcore Pornography and Drugged Titillation is given your attention. You must make a Dharma Commitment to achieve Syrup-Level Concentration. Once this comes, you will not need further so-called External Encouragement; then ""Jesus takes the wheel.""

You must be ready to begin at the outset of this adventure. When you debark, you must know where you stand, and see the Great Path clearly. You will find the True Summit at the Other Foot of the Mountain, where you Perfectly Realize that it was all Perfectly Alright when you began. Then the whole history and purpose of the universe will be Easier to Understand than a Simple Two-Plus-Two Type Equation. You will have tamed yourself, become yourself, forgotten yourself, and actualized your True Self. This is Truly Possible.

Are certain mindsets or belief structures linked to an evolutionary advantage?  It's obvious we view the world differently than we did 1000 years ago, or 5000 years ago.  Gods have come and gone and reasons for living have done the same  but humans have persisted when they have not. 

We are constantly challenging the world, a reason for being, trying to derive and solve all the laws of nature.  There are certain people on board with that and driving our world on that front while others seem to be happy to sit and ""watch the world burn""?  Some who want to say ""I want to invent space travel so we can see what else is out there!"" and another guy who goes ""Uhhh what do you think was in that danish?  Was that a cheese danish?""  Is this an evolutionary competition?  If it is, it's a really sad competition.

So as being as experienced as i am i can read these sites and laugh at them because of all the obscure claims these sites make.

On another hand after i stopped laughing i realized that the reason why people are so ignorant to the truth on the topic of marijuana and it's uses/side effects is because of all these sites out there that the corporate community is putting out there as ""drug awareness"". what makes this so serious is to a less experienced person they go out there and read these sites and believe them which as someone with experience i know that its all about the expectation when using such mental tools so people out there have this propaganda ingrained in them since they were young schools etc. so yes while they still may try it possibly even a few times they are expecting bad or have the fear of having a bad experience and in turn this has pushed people away from it and strengthening their ignorant faith of the dangers of marijuana.

i guess the point i am trying to make is that marijuana is only illegal because the corporate world hates the idea of legalization and its because of all this blatantly obscure propaganda that sadly the current majority of the population voters believe it all.

Humans have created an eternal world with computers. 

With everything in life, there is change and eventual decay. I feel like nothing in life is truly stagnant as we're all affected by our environment. This is not true for computers. There is no decay in a computers world. There is no change (unless programmed). If you tell a computer to display a blue color, it will display that exactly blue color till the end of time. You could pull up images from reddit in 1000 years and see no change (in the computer world). This is probably the best grasp of eternity we can have, as everything a human knows eventually changes. Computer parts and things that exist in the real world will naturally age and decay with time, but digitally - everything is everlasting. Everything you submit to the internet is everlasting unless changed by a program or another individual. This post itself after submission can only be affected by the outside world, computer programming inside of it, or an external moderator. If these things did not exist and if theoretically parts never decayed, the information would last endlessly.
