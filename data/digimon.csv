You know, we've been a community for a very long time, and we've just recently passed over 800 subscribers! That's really amazing!... but, the moderation team has decided that we should really just give up.

I mean, let's think about this rationally. Virtually everybody you know of has heard of Pokemon. Even your grandma is smart enough to call a pokemon a ""Pikachu"" (even if that's not its proper name). Who the hell knows what an Agumon is? 

* Let's face it, Pokemon has the better games. Do I need to remind you about Digimon World 2?
* It's pretty annoying to add -mon to the end of every single creature in the Digimon universe. Pokemon got it right: There's no Pikachu-mon.
* And do I really need to say anything about [this](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100118025818/digimon/images/e/e4/Fusionevolution.jpg)?

We're really excited for this change, and we know you are, too. Henceforth, all Digimon-related content is forbidden, and should go to [the appropriate place](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon).

I posted on the DS game maker forums for testing, but the forums there are pretty dead. I just want people to try it out and give me some feedback. It's pretty much a fakemon game I guess but ~~I made it from scratch~~ made the gameplay myself and  used sprites from the internet. I hope it's enjoyable. If not just say it isn't and I won't have any hard feelings. I just wanted a casual game for people who like digimon. There might be a glitch or two so let me know. You can play it on no$gba but I don't know if the save function works. It does work on the DS with a flash card.

You can grab it on dsgamemaker.com/dsgmforum/index.php
under the finished projects category. 

I'm figure it's not good enough to be considered for the indie gaming subreddit, but since you guys like digimon I figure you guys must be pretty cool. And try out the other games there since I'm sure those people worked hard on their games too!

Edit: Fixed the Imperialdramon sprite and the Wargrowlmon sprite. If you have guilmon as a starter you end up having a Meramon sprite instead of Wargrowlmon sorry. I'll update the download after a few more edits.

Let me know what you guys think should be changed about it too!
Thanks!

**New update out**: There was a problem where digimon didn't digivolve. The updated version should fix the problem.

**Update**: Increased difficulty on bosses. Chronomon is now available

**Update**:Fixed a bug where you can't fight the boss in crystal caves plus teleporting to computer with the Y button",,False,self,t5_2rxw7,1360985916.0,,,True,t3_18g2ki,http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/18g2ki/please_try_out_this_digimon_game_i_made/,

We need a good MMORPG based game where you get your own starter 'mon and you train it (cue the 80s's montage), with a battle system similar to Rumble Arena (that game had potential, I'm just sad the Digimon and moveset roster was VERY limited).

For the past few months, we've been talking about getting our reddit to come together and experience Digimon again: we'd watch it together, discuss it together, and relive our childhoods together, potentially introducing today's generation to our fandom.

Beginning in November, /r/digimon will be hosting its first ever Community Watch Party! We've been debating the best way to do this, and we think that we've come up with an excellent way to make sure that everyone can stay involved without having to be at a certain place at a certain time.

At the beginning of each week, we'll be posting a thread for that week's ""assignment."" Each week, you'll be asked to watch six episodes of Digimon, and then come back to discuss it. In this way, those of us with a busy schedule can watch one thirty-minute episode when we have a bit of free time, and those of us with more liberal schedules will be able to watch them all at once. (Of course, there's nothing stopping you from skipping ahead - just make sure that you're ready to talk about them when the time comes!)

*You can watch whichever localization of Digimon that you're most comfortable with.*

We're really looking forward to seeing what comes from this! Look for a thread on November 4 for Episodes 1 - 6 of Digimon Adventure! Sit down, relax, bring a friend and some popcorn, and get ready to open the Digiport!

After two days of ~~being lazy~~ extended April Fool's, I've gone ahead and returned /r/digimon to normal! I'm going to be making a few tweaks to the stylesheet in the future, 

Most of the credit to this ""prank"" is going to [Failcake](http://www.reddit.com/user/failcake), who contacted Seismictoss and I about doing this. He designed the stylesheets for both reddits. (If you'll remember, /r/Pokemon did this last year, and we weren't involved with it.)

Also, hi to the 600+ people that subscribed as of yesterday! I promise, there was [no ulterior motive](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3okvhh/) at all.

What bothers me about this is that, all things considered, he's actually very powerful, so much so that he could have completely overshadowed the other DNA Digivolutions had Imperialdramon not shown up shortly after.

First of all, Shakkoumon has the ability to absorb *any* energy attack sent his way. BlackWarGreymon's Terra Destroyer? Nope. Daemon's Evil Inferno? Nuh-uh. MaloMyotismon's Crimson Mist, which *killed Arukenimon in a single hit?* Didn't even *scratch* Shakkoumon.

He's also able to dish out a fair bit of damage, too. When he appeared, he was able to heavily damage BlackWarGreymon, whom had previously kicked the combined asses of both Paildramon and Sylphimon.

I suppose it's understandable that you might find his appearance a bit silly, but to me that just makes it even more awesome that he's able to kick so much ass.

The idea goes like this: the ""mon"" suffix attached to each Digimon actually makes a great deal of sense in a digitally-based world. It could be interpreted as a file extension of sorts, in that all Digimon are of a ""monster file"" which could be represented digitally as "".mon"" if you will. So ""Gatomon"" could be read digitally as ""Gato.mon"" as a code, and therefore she interprets that as her name.

Similarly, names could call for shortened keywords. For instance, ""Seadramon"" is a sea dragon, so his file name would be ""Seadra.mon""--a file name that has been shortened.

Then of course there is digivolution where as data is absorbed and the files grow, new data causes for a new name for the file and the digital iterations of the file could call for underscores. So an example would be ""Metalseadramon"" being digitally represented as ""Metal_seadra.mon"" Or ""Wargreymon"" as ""war_grey.mon.""

This could even be taken one step further in that the regional origin of the data that comprises the Digimon could factor into the Digimon's ""file name""; for instance, ""Seadramon"" appears very English in its name, so maybe its data mostly originated from English speaking countries. Gatomon's name is mostly Spanish in nature, so its data may have mostly originated in a Spanish country; Agumon, Japanese; etc.

The implications from here could be taken in any sort of manner; higher level forces at play in the digital world that could understand and manipulate the digital code could lack the .mon suffix and have a more general name or another suffix, such as .syst for ""system"" or something similar. Or even look at [Yggdrasill](http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Yggdrasill) who makes various appearances in Digimon media: he is regarded as the ""master computer"" that controls the Digital World and lacks the .mon suffix; perhaps because he is not a file but a higher level of unified code.",,False,self,t5_2rxw7,False,,,True,t3_r7wno,http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/r7wno/theory_on_digimon_taxonomy/,

1. What digimon would you like to see?
1. What season would you prefer to see it based on?
1. Would you want it to be based on the toy digivices?
1. Would you pay for it?
1. Would you be interested in a barcode scanner?
1. Would you like it to calculate when you walk as a step in the game?
1. How big would you want the map?
1. Would you mind adverts?
1. If no, what about an advert for the subreddit
1. How involving do you want the game to be

There's probably a bunch more I could add, so if you have any idea just reply or message me. In addition to that, if you would like to help out either by porting it to different language, making pretty pictures etc also message me.

It's my pleasure to come to you today with some excellent new updates for our community. I've got three main things to talk about today, and then I'd like to get your opinion on something.

Starting today, you can now select your own flair! And [this time](http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/ljjh6/user_flair_coming_soon_to_rdigimon/), it's here to stay! Thanks to [Jamesathan](http://www.reddit.com/user/Jamesathan), you can now select from multiple colors of the Season 2 and Season 3 Digivices, as well as Agumon, Gabumon, and the front and back of the Blue Card from Digimon Tamers! We're going to be working to add more, so please let us know [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/xq67b/rdigimon_needs_an_upgrade_we_need_flairs_of_our/) what type of flair you would like in the future! We won't always be making announcements about new flair that we add, so check back regularly!

Additionally, starting today, you can now mark your posts as ""Spoilers."" After you submit your post, select the ""flair"" option beside ""nsfw."" (You can also select ""Meta"" for /r/digimon-related posts, and we have ""Update"" for updates from the moderators. I'm not positive how to make that mod-only at the moment, so [please let me know](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=enforte) if you do!)

Finally, we've officially hit 2,500 subscribers! When I started /r/digimon two years ago, I had no idea that it would get this large! I'd really like to thank our friends at /r/pokemon for helping with the annual April Fool's Day switcheroo, [Seismictoss](http://www.reddit.com/user/Seismictoss) and [Takuya813](http://www.reddit.com/user/Takuya813) for helping with moderation, and all of you for producing such great content!

Before I let you all go, I've noticed that there have been a lot of people interested in re-watching the series. Would there be enough interest to hold a community-wide rewatch? If so, let's try and get one set up, where we'll watch from the very beginning, and once a week, hold a discussion on the episodes we watched. We'll need a clever name for it, though, so be thinking of one!

Thanks again for everything, DigiDestined! I can't wait to see what else we can do together!

&lt;3,

I decided to finally update you all as to whats going on with this little project of mine. If you're following me you would know that I've had issues with my code not compiling, everything is fixed now so don't worry. The_Ubertoast has been amazing and put together a rough idea of what you guys want. I'm going to base the world around the first series of digimon and on File Island. If there's the demand I'll also leave room for expansions throughout the series at no cost to you. The whole thing will be 100% free, however you're welcome to donate (this will allow you to modify the colors or something similar). It'll follow a similar approach to Pokemon, the world is a top down 2D game for everything outside of battles. The battles will be a action platformer, with each digimon having 4 moves (2 default ones, 2 special moves). You guys generally want a large map, but I decided it would be better to release expansions often instead so you don't get too bored with the same place. I will also release expansions which allow for battles across players via the internet. My plan is to create and release a PC version this will just take me less time) and use RAD (basically release, see what people like/dislike, and repeat). When people are happy with it I'll port it to any platforms you would like to see it on. Obviously this is going to be hard, so if you want to help awesome. I could do with someone writing a solid story (TheDWGM pointed this out), If you're interested feel free to PM me with some kind of outline and contact information. Any kind of pixel art would also be good, I know some people but I prefer it if fans do it rather than someone with no connection, if you're interested you can PM me with some kind of example and your contact information. Programmers familiar with mobile games or Java/C will be useful, just PM me your contact information. Sound would also be awesome, I'm not expecting anything major, some kind of battle music and ambiance. If you have any ideas or anything you have to contribute that would be cool. I should also mention that I can probably handle all the jobs on my own or with friends, so it will get done, but not as fast.

Well, i should say i watched season 1 and 2. i honestly preferred it to pokemon at the time, despite its being an obivous rip off. i think its because it just felt more epic to me than pokemon ever did.
However, now i've gone back to it, i do enjoy it less, the character aren't as good as i remember, and the repetive nature of the show bugs me a bit. However, much like with the original pokemon, i still get nostalgic watching it, heck im even able to watch it dubbed, despite it being one of the worst dubs i've seen. 
I won't deny it has its good moments. i actually think season 2 is slightly better than season 1, in terms of characters and plot. But its not hard to see why a lot of people dismiss it.
HOWEVER, after season 1 and 2 , i watched tamers....and was blown away by how different it was and how much better it was. As a reboot of the franchise, its probably one of the best reboots out there. And its the first time, i've actually wanted to actually purchase it, but i doesn't seem to be available in the uk, which sucks.
So, in conclusion, i don't hate season 1 and 2, I just don't thnk it stands out as well, as it did when i was a kid. I still love it, but in a nostalgic way, not for its plot or characters. Tamers does pretty much everything better, and i honestly wish it had been the first season in the franchise. it just feels like it has more of an idenity, other than just being a pokemon rip off, and i think a lot of people wouldn't have dismissed it , if they had seen it",,False,self,t5_2rxw7,False,,,True,t3_t4z81,http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/t4z81/does_anyone_just_watch_digimon_for_the/,

This year is Digimon's 15th anniversary. Digimon World Re:Digitize is releasing today in Japan. August 1st, the much celebrated date of when the Adventure children went to the Digital World, is approaching soon. Now is a great time to update as many people as we can on the status of Digimon and our fansites.

If you own a currently active site or old Digimon site that hasn't been updated in ages, do so right now! Tell us that you're just 'checking in' to update everyone, and you can link to these threads. Anyone searching through old Digimon communities can find these messages and see that the fandom as a whole is still very active, and Digimon is still going. You can link to [DMO](http://www.joymax.com/dmo/) and the [Re:Digitize Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/Digimon.World.Re.Digitize) page as well, to increase their traffic and show that english Digimon fans want more releases.

I'll be posting threads like these anywhere I can in the community, to find as many people as possible. I encourage webmasters to post in any of these threads they want to, leaving a message about who they are, what their site was all about, and what they're doing today in the Digimon fandom. You can give shout outs to old friends and any other messages you'd like to, as well. Any thread posted in will be linked to from every other thread which I can update, creating a network of them.

If you know any former webmasters, it would be a great help if you could point them here.

I'm sure many of you have heard of DMO and have been itching to try it. A digimon MMO? How awesome does that sound?! Well, you will be sorely disappointed. It had a lot of potential but the greediness of the publisher, Joymax, has really tainted the game. It's free to play but without using the cash shop you won't get very far. Sure it's great at first but as soon as you want to start being ""good"" at this MMO, you're going to have a very difficult time.

I'll start with some good points first:

- **It's digimon.** Seriously, that's the only reason why people play this game. We're all just people wanting to play with and train our own digimon. Sadly it's lost that initial magic for me and I've seen what a horrible MMO it really is.

- **The Community is nice.** If you can find someone that speaks your language, they're pretty nice. Guild communities are good, very chatty and will usually lead to having friends outside the game. 

- **It's pretty.** You can see I'm struggling to find any good points here. But yes, the game looks nice. The models look great, the environments are nice, and you can edit a lot of the textures too. Some days it's nice just to hop on your digimon (...using a cash shop item) and ride through the digital world. 


-----Okay.. now for the bad------

- **The entire game is a grind fest.** Seriously, I'm not exaggerating. You will spend 99% of your play time slowly killing one digimon after another just to level up for only bragging rights and rankings.

- **All the ""quests"" are mind-numbingly boring.** Every single quest is either ""Talk to person A"", ""Defeat X amount of digimon"", ""Get X amount of items dropped from Digimon Y"" or ""Use item on Digimon Z"". That's... it. There is some sort of a story going on but you can tell there wasn't much care put into it. Maybe this [""cutscene""](http://i.imgur.com/gJlnOks.png) will show how much effort they put into it

- **It is extremely unfair to those who don't use cash.** This is mainly an issue when it comes to hatching new digimon. Allow me to explain; When hatching a digimon there are hatching phases. To add one phase to your egg you need to insert a certain amount of data (a random drop) for the corresponding type. When inserting the data there is a high chance that it will fail, eating up the data you used. To make things worse; on this fail there is a chance the egg will be completely destroyed and you'll need to get another one-- and these eggs are not easy to come by. Once you've reached phase 3 you'll be able to hatch a digimon. ...only problem is they will be tiny and very weak. If you don't want a tiny, weak digimon you can try to reach phases 4 or 5. Phase 4 giving you a normal sized and powered digimon, 5 giving you the biggest and strongest (but still has a random chance to hatch small anyway). It is near **impossible** to hatch a 5/5 digimon UNLESS you use cash. Cash eggs have a 100% chance of hatching at either phase 3, 4 or 5. So even when paying cash you might not get what you want. 

- **Everything is a gamble.** This is what I hate the most about this game. Like I said before, you can buy eggs from the cash shop and still only get a tiny, weak digimon. You can buy things called digiclones which you can use to make some of your digimon's stat's stronger (up to 12 times) but they have a very high fail rate from 5 times and up. And for more salt on the wound, when they fail there's a chance to make your digimon's stat go **down**. Still not convinced? Even the drops are a gamble. Digimon drop eggs (sometimes) when defeated which need to be scanned by an NPC (and cost in-game currency to do so) to find out what drop you got. It can be bread, clothes, data or absolutely nothing. This brings me to my next point.

- **The drop rate is level capped.** That's right, they have a drop rate cap. Unless there is a special event drop or something going on, only digimon within 5 or so levels from yours will actually drop any items. Which makes grinding for mercenary digi eggs (the eggs that can hatch into a digimon for you) is an absolute nightmare.

- **You need to pay cash to unlock digivolutions.** I'm not kidding, it's that ridiculous. You need to buy things called Evoluters to unlock the ultimate stages and above of your non-starter digimon. If you buy cash eggs there is a chance they'll already have some stages unlocked but using normal eggs they will never have any unlocked. Sometimes there are events where they give out evoluters but these are rare and they only give you about half of what you need so that you end up buying the rest. Even more annoyingly, the amount of evoluters needed varies from digimon to digimon. For ultimate you'll need anywhere between 3 and 5, and for mega you need anywhere between 6 and 9. Some digimon even have their burst modes, buuut you can only unlock those by buying a special item in the cash shop for them. This item is the price of about 8 evoluters.

- **There is no PvP.** Need I say more? There is no real reason to level up your digi other than feeling cool and going for level rankings. Oh but make sure you choose which digimon you want to level for rankings wisely, a few digimon don't even have a ranking page due to Joymax's stupid website.

- **There are bots freaking everywhere.** So. Many. Spam. Bots. Constantly shouting and whispering to you their stupid websites and other crap. You can also download botting programs from sites to grind and play for you. Botting is so blatantly obvious and easy to do that you'd think that the mods would ban them right away. Oh wait, **there are no mods.**

- **Barely anyone speaks English well.** Now I don't mean to be racist, but this is a serious problem. I need to be able to talk to others  in my party about the rate at which they're hunting, ask questions, answer questions and many other things. The majority of players are Indonesian, so if you can speak Indonesian you won't have much of a problem.  Most people know the word ""Party"" and that's it. When playing the English DMO, I expect the other players to understand English.

- **The EXP rate is horrific.** From level 1 to about 41 the EXP is fine, but from there on it stars to get very slow. Without any EXP boosters (gotten from events and the cash shop) it will be about one hour per level, half an hour if you've got a good party. After level 50 you'll only get a few levels per day and 70+ it's just ridiculous. The maximum level is 90 for digimon and 99 for tamers. Tamers level up about 4x slower that digimon. If you want to bring the EXP up to a normal, durable level you'll need to use cash for boosters. 

- **The ""abilities"" do nothing.** Now, after my last point I bet you're probably thinking ""Why not just attack multiple digimon at once?"". Well the problem with that is.. you can't. Sure you can have multiple digimon attacking you but you can only attack one digimon at a time. Every single ability does nothing but damage to one digimon. No effects, no statuses, no buffs, no AOEs, just damage to one digimon. Boooring.
 
- **Americans have an advantage.** When you buy the cash shop currency, called ""Silk"", there is normal silk and premium silk. Items bought with premium silk can be traded, and therefore sold. I've looked at the methods of buying PSilk and I've never heard of any of them. Why is this such an advantage? You'll see in my next point.

- **Player shops are ridiculously overpriced.** The in game currencies are bits, mega and terra. 1000B = 1M and 1,000,000M  = 1T. With 1T you are considered rich, it's not very easy to get to without selling cash items. To buy a 5/5 egg from a player,  you will be paying from about 40-50T, a figure impossible to get to without cash. In the Korean DMO, you'll never pay more than 12T for anything. In English DMO, 12T will get you a 4/5 digimon with no evolutions unlocked. This supports my other point about the game being unfair to non cashers.

In conclusion it's a fun little MMO at first but once the initial shine wears off you can see all the terrors that lie below. I urge you to try this game and see how far you can get without using cash before falling asleep.

If you have any questions feel free to ask, I don't bite. I hope that other DMO players can agree with my points, if not I'm open to discussion.

Today, we begin the first week of our Community Watch Party. For those of you who didn't see [the original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/11em6f/introducing_the_rdigimon_community_watch_party/), we're going to be watching every single episode of Digimon together - starting with the original series, Digimon Adventure - and discussing it!

Before we get started, though, I'd like to remind you of a few important things. First of all, you can watch any localization of Digimon that you'd like. Use this thread all week, and next Sunday we'll post a new thread for the next six episodes. Of course, you can go ahead and watch ahead, but we're only going to be discussing the first six this week. On that same note, **use spoiler tags if you are discussing ANYTHING from a future episode or season.** To use spoiler tags, use the method described in the sidebar. If you see a spoiler, report it, and we'll remove it.

Here's your assignment for the week:

episode | eng | jap
:--|:--|:--
1 | And so it begins... | Hyoryu? Boken no Shima!
2 | The Birth of Greymon | Bakuretsu Shinka! Gureimon
3 | Garurumon | Aoki Okami! Garurumon
4 | Biyomon Gets Firepower | Shakunetsu! Badoramon
5 | Kabuterimon's Electro Shocker | Denko! Kabuterimon
6 | Togemon in Toy Town | Parumon Ikari no Shinka

One girl sounded very ignorant in the debate when she argued with ""Yeah well Digimon are totes uncreative."" That started a fire in the room, so many people raised their hands to point out all sorts of cool, very creative details about the digimon tv show and games that have come out over the years.

Again, I'd like to congratulate our entire community for making it to 2,500 subscribers! It's great that we can get so many people together to talk about Digimon! To celebrate, I'm very happy to announce that **[Joshua Seth](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0293196/), voice of Tai Kamiya, Himi Yukata and various Digimon will be doing an AMA with us next Tuesday (8/14)!**

Joshua is well-known within the voice acting community for his roles as Taichi Kamiya (Digimon), Shobu Kirifuda (Duel Masters), Tetsuo Shima (Akira), and the titular character from Cyborg 009, among others. You might also recognize him as the announcer for Kids WB's ""Aftertoons Show"" and ""Saturdays: Unleashed"". Since 2005, when he retired from voice acting, he tours as ""Joshua Seth: Psychological Illusionist,"" and has been nominated this year for Best Male Artist and Best Live Novelty Artist by Campus Activites Magazine.

I'm very grateful to Mr. Seth for taking the time out of his schedule to join us and answer questions! Joshua voices some of my favorite characters, and I'm be very interested to have this opportunity! If you get the chance, please check out [his website](http://www.joshuaseth.com/)!

I've noticed a few posts talking about rewatching/getting back into the anime so I have a few questions for you guys:

* I stopped watching Digimon at the end of Adventure 2 regularly, only catching a few episodes here and there of the later series. Should I watch them now as a 20 year old?

* Watching Adventure as a kid meant I watched the dub, something I learned is often a butchered version of the original through watching a few other anime, Should I rewatch it in Japanese or is there no point?

I should also mention that roughly a year ago I rewatched Adventure 1&amp;2 (dubbed) and played at least some of each of the games released for the DS in English so I definitely still enjoy Digimon in general",,False,self,t5_2rxw7,False,,crest6,True,t3_127x6m,http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/127x6m/watching_digimon_anime/,

First of all, I'd like to announce the results of our [moderator search]( http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/sn61t/join_the_digimods_inquire_within/). After some careful deliberation between Seismic and I (that took twenty-one days), we've decided to add [Takuya813](http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/user/Takuya813) to our ranks! We'd also like to thank everybody who applied - it was an incredibly tough decision, and we're going to give you guys special consideration the next time we're going to expand our moderator base.

Secondly - and this is my favorite bit of news - /r/digimon is officially on Freenode! We've got a channel at ##reddit-digimon that you can connect to with your favorite IRC program, or [through your web browser]( http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##reddit-digimon). You're welcome to log on any time and join in the digital discussions! (Server is irc.freenode.net, if you're not sure!)

I'd like to get a community meeting together at some point in the near future so that we can talk about the future of our little corner of reddit. I'd like to get us all together to work on a big project that'll really put us on the map. So, be thinking of ideas!

I expect to see all of you on IRC at some point - I think it'll be great to get to talk some in a more lively forum! And, as always, contact me (or any of our wonderful mods) if you have any questions whatsoever!

1359094439.0,19,self.digimon,178r6r,Just what IS the Digital Hazard? Here's my theory..,Zennistrad,21,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/178r6r/just_what_is_the_digital_hazard_heres_my_theory/,"In Digimon Tamers, The Digital Hazard is a powerful force of destruction that exists within Guilmon, as signified by the symbol on his chest. When he digivolved into Megidramon, the Digital Hazard's full destructive potential was unleashed, threatening the very existence of the Digital World itself.

However, if you look closely at Takato's original drawing of Guilmon, you'll notice that the Digital Hazard symbol isn't there. The Digital Hazard was somehow incorporated into Guilmon during his creation.

But what exactly IS the Digital Hazard? How can a single Digimon display enough destructive power to threaten the Digital World itself by its mere existence?

I have a theory: the Digital Hazard is the real reason for the D-Reaper's destructive rampage.

The D-Reaper was created by the United States government as a defense program to keep the number of digital lifeforms in the Digital World in check, but why? The digital world didn't pose a significant threat to the real world at the time, why were they worried about it?

Well, it just so happens that the D-Reaper is based off of real-world history. [The ""Creeper"" Worm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creeper_virus) was an experimental self-replicating program that displayed a message, widely considered to be the origin of all computer viruses [(source)](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/23/internet-history). The first anti-virus program was created in response, and it was called *The Reaper.*

My theory is that the Digital Hazard is based off of the Creeper, and that destroying it was the D-Reaper's true purpose. Unlike the Creeper, however, the Digital Hazard was truly malicious in its design: it infected the digital world and made Digimon destructive and violent. If left unchecked, the infected Digimon would reach the world's communications networks and bring about significant damage to them. In response, the United States Department of Defense created the D-Reaper to destroy infected Digimon and keep the remaining population in check so that they wouldn't be able to threaten the world's networks again.

But as it turns out, the Digital Hazard Virus was never completely wiped out, and somehow it was incorporated into Guilmon's data during his creation. When he digivolved into Megidramon, the Digital Hazard corrupted his data, causing his incredible power to surge out of control and disrupt the fabric of the Digital World.

Sensing the very same virus that it was created to destroy, the D-Reaper was alerted to the presence of the Tamers, but having now evolved intelligence decides to infiltrate their group instead in order to learn more about organic life and how to ""delete"" it.

**TL;DR: The Digital Hazard was the first computer virus, and its infection of the Digital World was the real reason for the D-Reaper's creation.**",,False,self,t5_2rxw7,1359135280.0,,3red,True,t3_178r6r,http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/178r6r/just_what_is_the_digital_hazard_heres_my_theory/,

It'd be sort of like Takuya and Koji from Digimon Frontier using both the Human and Beast Spirits for their Fusion Evolutions.

Here's the idea I have so far:

Veemon: Plasdramon

Title: The Fusion Dragon

Description: An 8-foot-tall humanoid dragon digimon with blue scales and large wings, wearing a breastplate, shoulder guards, greaves, and forearm guards. The right half of his armor is red, and the left half is black. His right shoulder guard resembles Flamedramon's helmet and curved horn, while his left resemble's Raidramon's helmet and lightning-shaped horn.

Attacks: 

* Fusion Flame: Fires a large sphere of orange flames at the opponent.

* Fusion Blitz: Covers his body in light blue electricity and rams the opponent.


Hawkmon: Swallowmon

Title: The Sky Samurai

Description: A 6-foot-tall humanoid bird with red feathers and talon-like feet, a pair of wings folded behind its shoulders, and a swallow's tail. He wears white robes, and the top half of his face and beak is covered with a silver winged helmet, similar to Halsemon's. In his right hand he carries a katana sword.

Attacks:

* Zephyr Slash: Slashes with his sword, launching a razor-sharp blade of air at the opponent.

* Swallow Cut: An impossibly fast attack that slashes the opponent with its sword twice in quick succession.


Armadillomon: Petromon

Title: The Ocean Driller

Description: A 6-foot-tall bipedal humanoid wearing white full-body armor with gold highlights, his rounded head being featureless save a pair of eyes and a harpoon-like nose. White metal fins extend from multiple points on his armor, including its arms, legs, and back, and he carries in his right hand a spear with an elongated drill at the end.

Attacks:

* Drill Torpedo: Launches the drill at the end of the spear at the opponent.

* Black Gold: Launches a glob of crude oil from his spear to slow down the opponent.",,False,self,t5_2rxw7,1366923269.0,,3red,True,t3_1d3cqy,http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/1d3cqy/i_just_had_an_awesome_idea_the_regarding/,

What The Egad started analysis of Tamers, but just made one video in this series (I love Tamers, so it'd be great to see how it holds up to the scrutiny of his Adventure 02 retrospective); likewise, JesuOtaku didn't make the Part 3 video for her Tamers series (the part where she would actually explain her major criticisms and give a rating for the series), and when she [started these digimon videos](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/ir/jo/jar/27199-intro-to-digimon-month) she planned to also do Frontier and Savers.

Maybe you guys can help me find a childhood toy?,thelightscallmehome,19,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/1dkgwg/im_so_excited_to_finally_find_this_subreddit/,"Tl;dr version: I'm looking for [this](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2r8XEB8Bae0/0.jpg) Raidramon figure, that came in [this](http://di1-4.shoppingshadow.com/images/pi/6f/8b/85/90065755-260x260-0-0_Pokemon+Digimon+Digivolving+Flamedramon+W+Trading+.jpg) box. (The card is not needed, as I already have it).

Non-tl;dr version:

When I was a kid, my mom got me one of the transforming Raidramon figures that I was just so excited to have. I took it almost everywhere with me to play with it, but mostly in front of the house we lived in at the time. 

One day while playing with said toy, a neighborhood teen came by and found me trying to transform it into... whatever else it was that Raidramon turned into. (I can't remember if it was another form, or the digiegg). This kid asks me if he can try, and like the all too trusting kid I was, I gave it to him. He promptly broke it, threw it in the grass, and told me he was sorry he couldn't fix it. The bastard made me cry!

Anyway, my mom decided it would be better off to give it to GoodWill (at least, I hope it was GoodWill, and not a dumpster). I've been looking for it ever since, but haven't been quite lucky enough to come across a full one. 

So, if anyone has an extra one they wouldn't mind selling, I'm very interested! ",,False,self,t5_2rxw7,False,,gabumon,True,t3_1dkgwg,http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/1dkgwg/im_so_excited_to_finally_find_this_subreddit/,

She was standing with her other friends in a group, cutting a cake. Sora blew out the 18 candles and they cut off a slice. The cake was chocolate,  her favourite. No one at the party felt that it was childish. Except davis, but no one really invited him anyway

For they were just kids when they started their adventures, twelve years old when their lives changed forever. The digimon they met never forgotten, but sometimes, it was just nice to get back to being twelve, even if she was Eighteen.

Tai held onto his gift, close to his chest. Looking around the room he saw the others. TK was getting Kari a piece of cake, and Sora was already into her boyfriends gifts. The silky purple dress was draped across a chair as she swung the tennis racquet around, nearly clocking Matt in the head. Surly more would come from him later that night, but Tai just held onto his gift. 

They‚Äôve been friends forever. From the battle of Heighten View Terrace, right to the events with MaloMyotismon. They have been through alot, but to Tai they had been through more. Her current boyfriend went through the same things they did, but he didnt have the history.

Sora took notice to the box in Tai‚Äôs hands. She put the racquet down, and gave matt a piece of cake. ‚ÄúTai, you Haven‚Äôt given me your present yet!‚Äù pointing to the small square object that seemed so foreign to him when he realised he was holding it.
‚ÄúOh, this‚Äù he said with slight hesitation. ‚ÄúIve just been waiting for the right time‚Äù

‚ÄúTai, I think the right time was when everyone else was giving me theirs. I wouldn‚Äôt want to forget yours‚Äù
Tai handed over the gift. The box it came in was small, indicating that it wasnt as expensive as what Matt gave her. But she opened it anyway, she obviously didnt care. 

Putting her eyes on the contents, she became almost furious, but after a moment, a soft smile fell over her. ‚ÄúStupid Tai‚Äù. She took the hair pin out, and placed it in her hair, shaping her beautiful orange bangs.

‚ÄúI figured you‚Äôd like it, since you stopped wearing that dumb hat‚Äù. Tai didn‚Äôt need to say anything, but he couldn‚Äôt resist the flirtation
Sora replied with her own jest ‚ÄúSo now you don‚Äôt like my hat, huh? Must be very confusing‚Äù

The two just smiled at each other,losing themselves in each other eyes. Both knew what was there, but they decided to just let it go. Until Sora gave Tai a kiss on the cheek ‚ÄúThanks Tai‚Äù

The two would remain friends after that, leading perfectly normal lives, until they were called together again, at a most unfortunate time",,False,self,t5_2rxw7,False,,1orange,True,t3_17z8qm,http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/17z8qm/so_i_wrote_this_instead_of_going_to_bed_last/,

Well, apparently those were canon as both Ryo and Millenniummon appear in a [flashback Ken has while dreaming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dQrwyuX39U). Ryo also appears briefly in [Digimon The Movie](http://imgur.com/DxWuI9A) which is proof that he existed in the Adventure universe.

At the end of Digimon Season 3/Tamers there's a wormhole leading back into the Digital World, which we can later assume played a role in Runaway Locomon, allowing them to reconnect with their Digimon. The story in my head plays out as the following:

Ryo's rookie partner, Monodramon is feeling very ill and eventually succumbs to the pain, resulting in an enormous loss of data. The data is that of a revived, fully powered and revenge seeking Zeed-Millenienniummon. He attacks Ryo and the other tamers out of a fit of rage and says he must destroy ""the other"" as well. This opens a wormhole into another universe. Ryo and Takato tell everyone to get up, as they quickly get their stuff and venture off into the wormhole on a quest to stop this monster. Once they arrive in a town different from their own, Ryo guides them to an apartment. He knocks on the door, and Ken answers it.

Basically each part would be a recap of an entire season worth of events.

Or even for us that have watched it multiple times just to have some quick reference when we do discussions on here, for example ""whats your favorite season?"" If you get confused with all the characters, digimon, events, etc, then you can watch the playlist to remember  The parts will probably be around 5 minutes each so I will really be feeding you a lot of information.

I might, if this gets enough responses, expand even more and discus sets of episode, every 7 or so as a collective.

We're at over 230 subscribers, and we've got a great community that's been building up. Up until now, I've been managing the reddit on my own, but now that we're slightly bigger, I figured that now would be the perfect time to add our second moderator!

[Seismictoss](http://www.reddit.com/user/Seismictoss) has been awesome. He submitted our reddit logo, managed [/r/Jogress](http://www.reddit.com/r/jogress/) (an alternative Digimon reddit), and has submitted a ton of content here.

A while ago, he said that he was very interested in becoming a moderator here, but since we were so small, I told him that it would be best to wait. Now, though, I think is the perfect time to induct him as the newest moderator here.

So, let's hear it for Seismictoss!",,False,self,t5_2rxw7,False,,card2,True,t3_mp6qw,http://www.reddit.com/r/digimon/comments/mp6qw/introducing_rdigimons_newest_moderator/,moderator

While this is, for the most part, not really valid, since the two series have quite distinctive designs, there are a few Digimon out there that really do look like Pokemon, and vice versa.

Here are some I can think of off the top of my head:
