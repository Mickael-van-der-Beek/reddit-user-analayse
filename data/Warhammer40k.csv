In 5 hours there were roughly 16-18 customers, many of which were families.  I count each family entering GW as 1 customer.  So there was more likely between 30-50 people that were in one of your stores over a 5 hour period.

Of those 16-18 customers **""1""** purchased something.  Every other customer had the exact same reaction.  The moment they saw the pricing they were IMMEDIATELY turned off &amp; walked out of the store politely but will never return again.

The GW owner did a fantastic job.  He helped new customers paint a miniature, allowed them to choose 1 of 3 tabletop games to play &amp; he played with great enthusiasm with them.  Made it fun.  The success of the store was in absolutely no way indicative of his lack of passion for the hobby.

Here is my concern.  You are literally turning away a massive portion of potential sales as a result of your overpriced products.  If you were to make your products more affordable, more people would be playing &amp; it increase your overall profit.  

I'm having a hard time believing that GW is better off making 1 sale &amp; turning away 90% of its potential customers than making their products a little more affordable &amp; getting more players into the game.

This decision doesn't just effect you GW.  It effects the entire mini wargaming community.  I've found it increasing difficult to find players to play with.  Lots of independent retailers that carried GW products have stopped doing business with you as result of the new trade agreement which has compounded the issue further.

To top it all off, there are dozens of other companies entering the mini wargaming market &amp; selling products at a fraction of what GW is.  Infinity, War Machine, The Toughest Girls of the Galaxy, Malifaux...you name it.

I'm not sure who is managing the business at Games Workshop, but I think its time you re-examine your business model.  This hobby is more expensive than some drug addictions...

I know you are all eager to get into an AMA. The mods from /r/warhammer40k were nice enough to reach out so I think it's more than logical to have our first AMA in /r/warhammer40k.

I know you all have very strong opinions, but please remember this is a chance to ask questions and have some quality time with the devs. Don't get me wrong, feel free to bring up concerns as long as they are kept in a format that is concise and answerable in a timely manner.

We will be streaming on twitch.tv in addition to the AMA in case some questions are a little too tricky to answer by keyboard. It's up to you if you wish to put some structure in the AMA or just let it run free.

The top 5 bests questions / comments or suggestions will have a reward. The process will be entirely up to the mood of our team. 

We are planning the AMA this week or early next week. Tomorrow I will send you the exact time. We were thinking of splitting the AMA into two parts, around 10:00 AM EST for our European friends and 16:00 for the west coast. You can start preparing questions if you want to, or just chat meanwhile and go wild about the hidden clues(S) on the website.

All the bests,

'Dispatched within 2 weeks' - Right. Cheers for the effort.

Seriously GW, suck a dick. Oh and if you like it I'm charging you extra for the money shot.

Hello readers of /r/warhammer40k! We've received a couple complaints about meme posts in mod mail, so we're considering removing them altogether. Obvious reasons for this is they aren't really thought or discussion provoking. At the same time though I can see the appeal of one or two every once in a while, so I'd like to ask your opinions on what we should do.

The options I've already come up with are as follows:

1. Remove meme posts altogether

2. Remove meme posts after they receive a certain number of reports, ex: if a post has 3 reports I'd remove it

3. Allow meme posts but only allow 2 on the first 50 posts at a time. This'd essentially mean they can be here, but the concentration would be extremely diluted.

4. Just allow meme posts

Let me know what you all think. I'd like to implore you all to not to downvote on other's comments if you disagree, simply make a comment about yours.

**UPDATE: It seems the majority feels memes aren't an issue for now at least, so I think we'll just keep 'em**",,False,self,t5_2rr81,1363804447.0,,,True,t3_1anpj1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1anpj1/so_how_do_you_all_feel_about_meme_posts/,moderator

Here's my story:

When I was just starting to play warhammer because I made friends with a couple of guys at my high school and I was fortunate to have a GW store in my hometown, I had the experience that gave me an everlasting nagging in the back of my head that my opponent was cheating. One of my friends, we'll call him Barry, was preaching to me about the glories of the space marines and saying all of these things that made the space marines seem invincible. Barry was a nice guy and all, but he was very quick to anger, and nothing made him angrier than losing at warhammer; I learned this the hard way. Fast forward 2 months, I've realized that the space marines, despite all of their glorious invinible and testosterone enducing manliness, weren't to my liking. I had created a 1500 point army of my beloved Tyranids specifically designed to rip apart space marines and chew the power armoured panties to pieces. However, my friend Barry thought he could take them on. Now I at this point in time know the space marine codex very very well, and can recite almost all the rules for each unit because my friend Barry had told me to read the codex religiously (I don't know if he was being funny or serious with the book being about relic and glory hugging high gothic ninnies) and I took him very literally so I did. We exchanged lists without much problem and he gave me a smile as he whipped out his army cases, out plops tanks galore, land raiders, predators, and demolishers as well as numerouws rhino's come onto the board. Barry obviously thought that I would be Shock and awe'd by this. We rolled for who would go first, I rolled a 6 to his 4 and he failed to steal his initiative. What ensued was Barry from turn 1 claiming that his commander gave all infantry within 18"" an extra D6"" movement and always full range with weapons. He also claimed that his demolisher's cannon was a 60"" range weapon and before I could argue he rolled the dice to kill my Trygon Prime. I asked to look at his codex several times and he claimed that I should ""know my enemy."" The store-owner overhears us and walks over and I proceed to tell him what's going on, he says that Barry should play fair or he'd be kicked out. The store-owner pulls me aside and told me that I shouldn't play against Barry because he always twists rules. I just gave the store-owner a smile and said to sit and watch. What proceeds to happen is, with the store-owner present to stop anymore rule bullshitting, is 3 turns of Space marines getting butchered while my wave of Tyranids beat the living crap out of him. By turn 5, Barry is steaming mad and claims that I cheated and brought ""too many models"" with me . . . I didn't even know what to say to that with my army being a horde on and all. Barry then proceeds to make allegations that the store-owner helped my cheat and that we were both against him. I told him that he was a lying POS and that maybe he should try playing by the rules. That didn't make Barry happy. Not. One. Bit. Barry lunges at me and tries to punch me in the stomach, but he didn't know that the store-owner was a former soldier and he stopped him cold with an armbar that nearly broke his arm. The store-owner let go and told Barry to get out. Barry packed up his stuff and was heading out the door when I noticed my Swarmlord model was missing, when I made it known to the Store-owner, Barry turned around and gave me an evil little grin with my Swarmlord in his hand. I knew what he was going to do with it, and I watched as he threw it to the ground with all the rage a sore loser and bad sportsman could have and it shattered on the ground.  The store-owner offered to give me a new hive tyrant model, but I just said no, I was spent on the hobby for a while. Never played Barry again, never played Tyranids again. I moved on, but after a while, I got back into the hobby by playing IG and other armies. But I can never get that feeling out of my head when I play someone, that they're going to try and pull something on me.

There's always been a lot of criticism about the way GW currently does business. With this in mind I thought I would go to the source.

I intend to write a letter to GW with a series of questions in the hopes that they will respond, and I would like you to help me with some questions.

The idea is that any response they give will be posted for all to see on various forums (any recommendations also welcome) and will be unedited by myself so that the word is straight from them, without any bias interpretation.

Equally, I would ask that you remain neutral about the questions you ask. ""Why are your prices shit"" is a bad question. ""Can you explain why a tactical space marine squad, consisting of 10 models is (roughly) £20, when a space marine assault squad, consisting of 5 models is also (roughly) £20"" Is a good one. I believe they are more likely to answer this question and take the letter as a whole seriously if it is worded in this way.

I have been a casual player for about 20 years and the staff i've encountered have been friendly, fair and knowledgeable about the game. I intend to approach them with the respect they've earned for this reason and hope that they will cement that respect with a detailed reply. If not, then we can bitch about them til the end of the internet!

Also, I will hand write the letter rather than email/print. I find it takes a black hearted traitor/heretic to ignore a hand written letter.

I look forward to your questions!",,False,self,t5_2rr81,False,,,True,t3_1h8rpe,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1h8rpe/writing_a_letter_to_gw/,

Let's share them!",kerminsr,59,3,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/zscmq/heres_my_painting_and_modeling_advice_for_newbies/,"I’m bored at work and I thought I’d just compile a list of advice that I would give anyone starting out with the Warhammer 40k hobby.  Most of you out there probably know all of this, but for those that don’t: I wish someone had told me some of these things when I was blindly starting out.  

This list focuses on the hobby aspect of WH40K and not the gaming aspect.

First rule and hard truth: Games Workshop products are usually the most expensive and almost never the best quality.  Of course they make what I think are the highest quality miniatures out there.  For literally every other product associated with this hobby, buy another brand.  Here are some brands I know of, let me know if there are any I’ve missed.

Vallejo – Paint, pigment, primer (my favorite paints)

Reaper - Paint

Privateer Press - Paint

Army Painter – Variety of modeling supplies and paints.

GF9 – Variety of modeling supplies and tools (my favorite glue and green stuff)


Art store brushes are usually higher quality and cost less than brushes you buy at game stores.  Natural hair lasts longer than synthetic.  Brushes for watercolors work best for our purpose.


If you’re on a budget, buy used models.  Models, especially metal ones, can be stripped and repainted.  Soak in Castrol Super Clean overnight, then use a toothbrush and watch the paint peel away.  For god’s sake though; wear gloves when doing it.

**Modeling and painting tips for beginners**

* ALWAYS prime your models.  Trust me, you need to do this. 

* Add a couple drops of water to paint to make it apply easier and smoother.


* Add a little bit of soap (I find windshield washer solution works best) to your water cup.  It makes cleaning brushes easier.  It also helps break surface tension, so if you mix in a little of this water when painting it will help the paint spread more easily.

* Use blu-tack or similar product to hold models to empty paint pots while painting.  This allows you to paint without your fingers touching the model.

* Gluing sand to a base and drybrushing it will always look better than flock.  Art stores sell sand textured gels if you don’t like working with actual sand.

* Super glue accelerator exists and is awesome.  Sometimes it's more effective to use super glue and accelerator to fill gaps than using green stuff.

* In a pinch, you can sprinkle baking soda on wet super glue to fill large gaps.

* Used sprues have many uses.  Cut up pieces to make debris for basing.  Carve used sprues into tools for working with green stuff.  Cut a long piece and glue it to the bottom of a base before priming the model, letting you spray everywhere on the model without spraying your hands.  

* Pinning is easy to learn and makes building metal figures way easier.  Cheap paper clips work just as well as the expensive pinning wire you can buy at the game or hobby shop.

* Sheets of cork board can be broken up to create realistic rocks for basing.

* You can wrap thin wire around a slightly thicker wire for a nice looking barbed wire for basing.

* Painting Space Marine backpacks separately, then gluing it on can make it easier to paint the rest of the model.  This is also true for many other models.  Test fit before gluing to make sure you'll be able to reach everywhere with your paint brush.

* Vallejo and Tamiya make metallizers.  They are basically the metal flakes that are in metallic paints minus the pigment.  They can be added to any paint to make it a metallic version of that color.

* Learn to take care of your brushes and they will take care of you.  Clean thoroughly every time you paint and lick your fingertips to shape the brush back into shape for storage.  Brushes should last for years if you take good care of them.

* When brushes eventually break down and lose their tip or get misshapen,  don’t throw them away.  Crappy brushes can still serve a purpose (drybrushing, using for glue, etc.)

* Wash and dry your models before priming.  Sometimes models still have lubricant on them from casting or molding.  This can make the primer not stick to some parts. - *Thanks to* **MisterMeatball** 

* 2 or 3 thin coats of paint take less time than stripping a goobered up model and repainting it. And it looks better. Way better. -*Thanks to* **MisterMeatball** 

* Use a palette. A palette can be anything, from a piece of cardboard to a tile or an old plate. You slop some paint on the palette, then mix in some water until you get a thin, runny consistency. If you think 'milk' when mixing, you'll end up in the right place. -*thanks to* **Charlie-Green-Rug**

* Give your army variety.  Don't make every guy look the same, with the same colors and poses.  Mix it up, change the color or a shoulder pad or a helmet.  More variety will make your army look better in the long run.  *thanks to * **jbarket** *for the idea*

* Work on 2 or 3 models at a time.  I find it more convenient to move on to another model instead of just sitting around waiting for my washes to dry.

Please help me add to this list!  I definitely wouldn’t claim to know everything and I’d love to learn more.

**Murrdox** *asked me to put some priming tips up, anyone have any more?*
**Priming should always be done with care, it can be argued that it’s the most important step in painting.  Here’s some tips.**

* Avoid brush-on primer.  Spraying is really the only way to get a thin and even coat.  Even if you’re too young to buy spray paint, let your parents know they’re going to have to help you on this one.

* Always protect the area you’re spraying.  Some use newspaper, I use a 2-foot cube cardboard box.  I lay it on its side and put it on a chair.  It catches all the overspray.


* Don’t breath in the fumes, duh.

* If it’s super humid or rainy, you might want to wait to prime on a better day.  Humidity can make primer runny and take forever to dry as well.  Beware of spraying in direct sunlight as well.  You don’t want the particles to dry before reaching your mini.  This causes a chalky effect and is highly undesirable.  

* Ideal distance to hold the spray can is 1.5 to 2 feet away.  Start spraying the air, then spray in a sweeping motion across the model, stopping spraying *after* you pass the model.  This will take a few passes to get full coverage.

* When done spraying, always hold the can upside-down and spray until no paint comes out.  This keeps the nozzle clear so next time you use it you won’t have any problems.

1364060139.0,45,self.Warhammer40k,1av8s0,Thoughts on Tyranids and the Warp,donaldosaurus,52,7,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1av8s0/thoughts_on_tyranids_and_the_warp/,"One of the reasons that I love the background to Warhammer 40K is the fusion of dark fantasy (daemons, Lovecraftian horrors etc) with science fiction elements. This background is left intentionally vague and incomplete in places, which I also like as it not only gives the impression of a future so old and battered that its history is full of gaps, but also leaves plenty of scope for coming up with your own theories for why certain things are the way they are. It’s as pointless as arguing over whether Han Solo or Captain Kirk would win a fight, but fun nonetheless.

In that spirit I came up with some thoughts regarding the warp and specifically how it related to Tyranids. The warp is explained as something that is generated and formed by conscious thought. Presumably then it can only exist in any meaningful way where there is sentient life. Life can only exist in large numbers in galaxies, so the warp must exist in isolated pockets separated by the intergalactic spaces. (This might not be true, as the warp corresponds only loosely with realspace, but the spaces between galaxies are big enough that they’d probably be isolated).

As a sentient species (or at least, one that manifests psychic abilities) grows and matures, the emotions and desires of that race coalesce in the warp and inevitably give rise to chaos gods, or strengthen existing ones. The Eldar were all but destroyed when their unchecked hedonistic excess reached critical mass and created the warp entity Slaanesh. Mankind seem to be heading in a similar direction, albeit by strengthening existing gods (possibly because humanity is a more diverse race in terms of emotions and desire compared to the Eldar). Perhaps it is the natural life-cycle of an intelligent species to manifest psychic powers, colonise the majority of their host galaxy, and then in time be wiped out by the warp entities they spawn, leaving clear the stage for a later species to repeat the cycle. The universe is home to 400 billion or so galaxies (that we know of), which conjures the image of a void clustered with little islands of life, each with their own attendant gods formed in their own image; or at least in the image of their own unique and alien desires and predilections.

It is hinted at in the fluff that the Tyranids invading the Milky Way are fleeing something even worse lurking out in the void. The Tyranids evolved or were created in another galaxy and are predisposed to consume, multiply and move on. This singularity of purpose suggests they were engineered, rather than evolved naturally. With their ability to multiply rapidly and strip bare entire planets, it’s not difficult to imagine them expanding beyond the ability of their creators to control. Areas they strip of life would not be able to support their voracious appetites and their numbers would diminish. Areas that were given the chance to replenish would eventually be consumed once more in a never ending cycle of feeding.

This Tyranid hunger is never sated, and over the millennia its manifestation in the warp would grow and grow. With no other life or emotions in the galaxy the resulting god of hunger would be extraordinarily powerful, and its birth would be calamitous for the Tyranid hordes. Ironically, the species that had destroyed their creators with their unchecked hunger would now face a similar fate. Hunger-daemons would invade their realspace and consume trillions, and whole constellations would be pulled into the warp to be feasted on. The survivors would instinctively realise they had to flee, but there would be nowhere in their galaxy safe from the god they had unwittingly created. Their only choice was to abandon their galaxy and strike out into the void.

Denied the use of warp travel through the quiescent gaps between galaxies, the journey would take millennia, pulled along the faint gravitational tether of their nearest neighbouring galaxy by their Narvhal bio-ships. Thousands and thousands of years later the first tendrils of the survivor hive-fleets drift into the outer reaches of a spiral galaxy of some 400 billion stars, and find it teeming with life. The vanguard Tyranid forces are awakened from their slumber, ready to initiate another galaxy-wide holocaust, before they are once again forced to move on. 

There’s probably a lot wrong with this theory, but I like the idea of bespoke gods for each galaxy, reflecting the peculiarities of their species – especially a Hunger God, furious that it had no more life to feast on, casting its eyes across the stars to track down the last morsel that escaped its grasp.

Hello /r/warhammer40k! You may have recently seen a post regarding a tactical codex FAQ for the subreddit in order to field common army questions rather than have the same basic questions perpetually asked. After discussing the matter with the mods of /r/warhammer, we've decided it would be best to combine our efforts towards the FAQ. Anyway our new FAQ sub will be the /r/warhammerfaq. The way it'll work is if you would like to contribute content to the faq, just comment on the bottom of the existing page. If a page has been archived, just PM me (/u/over8000), /u/roboute, or /u/darkjediben and we'll fix it. when this happens we might add some comments that are particularly useful into the main post.

To ensure it's longevity, we are proud to announce the Warhammer Genuine Advantage program.

This program consists of a set of new technologies and policies to expand our existing audience and protect the game for year to come. Here are just a few key points from the new program:

* To prevent inferior reproductions of Warhammer products, all new products will contain a Warhammer Genuine Advantage RFID chip, which customers can scan to ensure they're purchasing only top of the line Games Workshop merchandise.
* To ensure all players are playing on a level playing field, customers will be required to register their purchases on the Games Workshop website and stores selling Games Workshop merchandise will be required to scan and verify a players models before they can be used in the store.
* To allow existing models to be used with the new WGA program, customers will be allowed to purchase RFID chips. The customer will need to be able to prove they bought the models (with a receipt or credit card statement) and pay for shipping and handling.

Games Workshop looks forward to hearing your feedback",,False,self,t5_2rr81,False,,,True,t3_1gnpqg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1gnpqg/games_workshop_is_proud_to_announce_warhammer/,

A lot of the smaller specialist game subreddits are dead, or close to dead, but I included them because I figured if the multireddit got popular it might help revitalize them. I also included /r/Miniswap and /r/minipainting, even though they aren't GW only, because they're good community resources (I've picked up several good tricks from /r/minipainting personally).

If you guys think I missed a subreddit, let me know, I tried to include them all. (Left out /r/warmaster because it has no posts, but I can add it in.)

For me, I'd have to say it's the fact that nothing will ever be done that actually advances the plot or storyline one bit. It's the fact that when I read a book that involves a character like Logan Grimnar, Dante, Calgar, Bjorn, etc., I know that there's never any *real* threat and therefore never any *actual* suspense. The universe is full of these characters that are all, essentially, too big to fail, so there's never a real threat to them.

I do a pretty god job of ignoring it most of the time, but it's bothersome at times to go into a 40k story or book knowing that, essentially, whatever I'm about to read doesn't really matter since the 40k universe is going to basically remain the same despite whatever transpires in the book.",,False,self,t5_2rr81,False,,,True,t3_11c8cc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/11c8cc/what_frustratesdisappoints_you_the_most_about_the/,

Spacemarines: 80 guys, 20 Terminators, 6 tanks, 3 Dreads, 2 Landspeeders and a Stormraven

Orks: 170 boyz, 9 Deffkoptas, 9 Kanzs, a Dread, a scratch built Stompa, scratch built Battlewagon, a standard Battlewagon, three Trukks and a Looted Rhino

IG: Valkyrie and 65 guys

Tau: 20 Kroot, 20 Fire Warriors, 2 Devilfish, a Hammerhead, 3 XV8s, 3 XV88s, a Broadside, an Ethereal and 4 Piranhas

'Nids: 35 Termagaunts, 20 Hormagaunts, 8 Genestealers, 6 Warriors, a Tyrant, a Carnifex, a Tervigon and 4 Ripper swarms.

This doesn't include some of the unbuilt models, including 60 more Ork boyz, 2 Drop Pods and 2 boxes of Ork Bikers

It was after the large portrait of the Emperor and Horus came out.  It had a very Operatic feel about it.  We thought, ""How cool would it be to have an Opera about the Horus Heresy and sung in High Gothic?""  I was wondering what fan feedback on this would be.  As far as I can tell the only other sci fi opera with any kind of public awareness was the one sung in Klingon.  What do you guys think?  Would you pay money to see a Horus Heresy opera?  Or at least buy the CD for one?  

EDIT1:  Wow!  A lot more attention than I thought I was going to get.  To the point that I am now seriously considering this as opposed to a ""cool idea.""  If I managed to get the time and talent required I would probably make a kickstarter out of this.  If any of you in the comments are seriously considering it as well let me know in a message.

This is obviously because each legion thinks highly of itself, but lead me to think how would you rank the original 18 legions. 

Obviously some excel at close quarters (world eaters, blood angels etc) whilst others prefer ranged (iron warriors and imperial fists) so its difficult to compare all of them. So i ask, who were the most accomplished?

My two cents are as follows, please feel free to pick this apart and correct my limited fluff knowledge;

1) Luna Wolves - generally regarded the most formidable legion
2) Ultramarines - have five hundred worlds devoted to them
3) World Eaters - because of their sheer brutality
4) Blood Angels
5) Imperial Fists
6) Space Wolves
7) Dark Angels
8) White Scars
9) Iron Warriors
10) Death Guard
11) Iron Hands
12) Emperors Children (seem to be doing well after a few teething issues early on)
13) Raven Guard
14) Night Lords
15) Salamanders
16) Word Bearers

However, my boyfriend thinks they're way too hard for a beginner to tackle in terms of Playing The Game. Seriously? Are they *that much* harder than anything else?

THE CHALLENGE: Model and paint one HQ of your choice. This can be any HQ choice from any codex.


THE RULES: In order to be considered for the prize, each person must submit two photos.

It was probably the most epic thing I'll ever do, to be honest... I want to hear some of your epic DH deaths, or just stories in general. 

Edit: So here's how Fineal, the Untouchable Guardsman died.

We're in this auction. Giant gold automaton starts prophesying doom and gloom and return of chaos and all that jazz. Robed dudes start cutting people down. Everybody screams and runs. One guy stands and starts laughing, like he's enjoying himself. Me and the assassin, we go over to ask him what the fuck is so funny. Tech priest and scum are hanging back a bit, shooting down some robed dudes. Adept is trying to find a guy we think is important. Laughy looks at me, says, ""I wonder how your brains taste...""

His skin sloughs off. Turns out he's some xenos scum. I take a shot at him, boltgun, double tap, straight to the face, point blank range. Emperor's Fury. Does exactly fuck all to him. The assassin is overcome with shock and falls to the floor tearing at her own flesh. The tech-priest and the scum both take shots with a boltgun and a hunting rifle respectively. Both hit. Both do fuck all. Fuck.

He shoots at me, I pass my dodge. I look back at the tech-priest, say, ""run"" and charge the xenos. Grab him with one arm, start pushing him away from our party. I'm taking damage, but fuck it.

He tries to hit me, but doesn't pass. The tech-priest has grabbed the assassin and is running the other way with the scum. I've pushed/carried him out of range of our party. Boltgun in hand, I look him dead in the eyes. 

""For the Emperor, you xenos son of a bitch."" 

I point the muzzle of my boltgun at my waist.

I push it right against the melta-bomb on my belt.

The top was made from half inch strips screwed to a piece of veneer. It is surprisingly strong with the addition of corner braces. The metal clamps hold it together, and the dowels keep it from shifting loose. I'll be adding two strips down the middle of each end piece, to keep the edges from falling over the white table below. I also need to come up with a way to keep the top from sliding around, in the likely event that someone leans on it mid-game.
Topped the whole thing in a Zuzzy 6x4 gaming mat. Total cost was just over $100.00. Most of that is the folding white table and the mat.

I love my Warhammer 40k books, the shallow ones and the deep ones. Recently I had the pleasure of reading Siege of Castellax ,a book from the point of view of chaos and ""Path of the Incubus"" one book in a trilogy written from the perspective of the Dark Eldar.   

I have been looking out for an Ork book for a few years now and have not come across one. Mind you my search has not gone far beyond a couple of book stores in my local area and a cursory glance over the Black library site. 

The only real writing I have seen on Orks was in the Dawn of War games and the Warhammer MMO  in both of which I loved the Orks for their whimsical nature.

PS: Does anyone else notice that book stores seem to have a hard time to keep all the Warhammer books in one section? Maybr thats just  local thing though.

Wraithbone is a plastic building material that is formed out of the Warp (an essentially endless resource) and used for building everything the Eldar use, from chairs to weapons to giant robots. Wraithbone is shaped by Bonesingers and is capable of repairing itself over time, unlike most other technology used by the other races who are constantly fighting a war against the erosion of time.

One application of this material is to create robots like the Wraithguard. These robots are powered by the souls of dead Eldar, who remember the skills of their life. Generally, the Eldar stick warriors into these robots who can help them fight, but that doesn't really make much sense.

Instead of a warrior, why not put a bonesinger in that armor? Then have that bonesinger make another Wraithguard, and have both of them make another. The dead don't need to sleep or eat, so they can (eventually) produce a limitless supply of war machines. Even if they can't make anything too fancy, eventually you've made enough missiles or whatever to just drown your enemies in psychic plastic.

It's a major thematic point that the Imperium is losing the technology war because they don't understand science and their factories keep getting nuked by Orks. The Eldar have the potentially for limitless production capabilities because there are a lot of dead Eldar and an infinite supply of Warp to turn into Wraithbone.

But then I also don't understand how the Necrons haven't killed anything for much the same reason. They don't sleep, they don't eat, so why aren't they building ships with infinity guns and broadsiding entire planets before leaving with their 'far more efficient than Warp' engines.

I just found this awesome custom map for a game called AtWar.
It's a free2play online multiplayer turn based strategy game. It's described as a mix of risk and civilization. You conquer cities and countries (in this case planets and sectors), gain income, buy units( there are many types of units with their strenghts and weaknesses), move them freely across the map (unlike in Risk where you move them in territories), make alliances with other players...
Up to 20 players can play on one map and a single game lasts about 1h, there are also many custom maps and scenarios like this one.

So if you ever wanted to wage a galactic war in Warhammer 40k universe here is your chance.

I started out with the Termi's. The Termi with the assault cannon I started with first. Using a brush I based, washed, then layered. I didn't like the results so I moved on to the others. Which I airbrushed then brushed on the details and some washing.

You don't have to be full detailed, but maybe some overview? 
Just like whose has the best Assault/Shooting Marines or anything like this.

PS: sorry for my bad english

**Black Templars:**
 
**Blood Angels:**    

* strong CC, but Red Thirst(?)

**Dark Angels:**   

* Fast Attack

* special squad Raven Wings (bikes and speeders)

**Space Wolves:**

Here are a few [photos](http://i.imgur.com/iqE0T.jpg) I took of it.

I'll comment first on the physical book. As a lover of all things bound, this book is almost like porn. It's hardcover is bound in leather and let me tell you, if you've never owned a leather-bound book before, you need to experience it. It's sublime. 

The pages are a thick stock, high quality with a decent satin gloss. The colour is bright, crisp, and the overall printing quality is pretty much flawless. They also properly bound the book in a pamphlet style so the book will lay flat and stay open to whatever page you've turned to - a huge bonus for us gamers. The inclusion of a cloth bookmark is just another example of the quality and attention to detail they put in to the whole production. To top it off, the corners of the covers are bound in foil embossed with the Imperial Eagle, and the pages are edged with silver.

Onto the content. 

To put it plainly - this book is an old-schooler's wet dream. I've been playing 40k in some capacity since Rogue Trader (my mom bought it for me for my 13th birthday) but it wasn't until 2nd edition that I really started to delve into the lore and backstory of the setting. And as a Chaos player, the Horus Heresy was the origin story of my entire army, and also a pretty core origin story for the entire setting. I remember pouring through codices, scrounging for every new detail about the Heresy and its participants. 

If only I'd had access to this book back then. 

Given that this is the first book in what they promise will be a series, I can't believe the sheer volume of information they've packed in. Every page is packed with detail. It has history and details regarding the Great Crusade, specifics about the organization and disposition of the Space Marine legions, army lists and stats for all of the key forces including several primarchs (Horus included!), information about the Titan Legions, pre-heresy vehicles and weapons technology, and - to top it off - they've included several of the characters from the novels (Loken!). They also made sure there's no shortage of scenarios and campaign rules to keep hobbyists very very busy for a long time to come. 

It's pretty clear that the people at Forgeworld who were involved in the making of this book are definitely fans of the material. It's been presented with such reverence and polish that it's hard to find any fault with the whole product. The only thing I can really come up with is the price. Once you ship it from the UK and pay the duty, the book ended up well over $100 CAD. That really limits the audience and I hope that Forgeworld can find a way to release a digital version of the book in the future so more people can enjoy it.",,False,self,t5_2rr81,False,,,True,t3_11ifs3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/11ifs3/the_horus_heresy_book_one_a_quick_review/,

This is pre-heresy (so no ascended daemon Lorgar or possessed/favoured Horus), at the height of their crusade power. They are solo (Alpharius and Omegon are both present but count as one for victory conditions), and can bring any of their wargear they wish.

The arena is say a largish island with most biomes present: a mountainous edge with snowy upper regions, some jungle, a desert, fresh water rivers and surrounded by beaches and ocean. It should have a mix of abandoned urban locations, including light, medium, and dense (maybe a smallish hive ruin).

There is no time limit and no rules of engagement (no nikea protocol for example, psyker powers are allowed).

How would it go down? Be great to see what you think the outcomes would be on things such as:

1. First Down
2. Honourable Mentions
3. Final Two
4. Victor

1376776078.0,23,self.Warhammer40k,1kkkvr,Disappointed in Space Hulk so far. A mini-review,Daemion27,24,1,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1kkkvr/disappointed_in_space_hulk_so_far_a_minireview/,"I consider myself a pretty huge fan of 40k in all its forms. I own three tabletop armies consisting of almost 20k points, have sunk hundreds of hours into the Dawn of War series and am a fluff fanatic. I was really looking forward to getting to play a videogame adaptation of the Space Hulk board game I've heard so much about but never got the chance to play. 

So far I'm about 8 missions in, and the gameplay is decent. Not great but certainly not terrible. The RNG for the dice in this game really seems to love screwing me over though. An example being the Thunder Hammer+Storm Shield guy dieing 4/5 times while using the guard option beforehand, and having to pour 4, sometimes 5 shots from my Storm Bolters into a single Genestealer just to still fail to kill it and watch as it tears my Termie's face off. 

While the above could just be bad luck, the quality of the game design really doesn't help me feel any better about the game's price tag or overall package either. The only good looking part about the game is the interior of the hulk itself which although they nailed the gothic theme nicely, shouldn't be the best looking thing in the game being how repetitive it is visually. The character models with helmets on look fair, while the helmet-less Sergeant's have faces who look like they came out of Oblivion's beta or something. They look AWFUL, and the Termies often do things like shoot down the wrong hallway while overwatching and still hit Genestealers no bullets touched or sometimes they just glitch up and shoot into the air for no reason. Another big issue is in the menus. The menus can often get buggy and overlap each other in terribly clustered ways that prevent you from navigating them. Its a glaring oversight and you can really tell the developers didn't do much to try and polish the game. To top it all off, theres also very mediocre voice-acting from the Lexicanum before each mission; his voice often shifting wildly as if the VA lost track of what kind of character he was trying to portray 5 words into every sentence.

If anything, even patched to fix the really wonky animations, id say this game deserves a $15 price tag at the most. If anyone's looking to get it, i definitely recommend waiting till it drops 50% during a steam sale or something. Surely don't pay over 20 for it. Honestly though, even that's probably way too much for this mess. But, if you can put all of the small things aside, I'm sure its decent for fans of the board game.",,False,self,t5_2rr81,1376777920.0,,,True,t3_1kkkvr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1kkkvr/disappointed_in_space_hulk_so_far_a_minireview/,

   Long story short, there are two issues. One is a bald guy named Mike who's 'that guy' because he has a little bit of power as a store clerk. Then he tried giving me crap because I'm using a non-GW version of the book I went and had printed myself because the main rule book is too heavy. I own that big book--I won it at a local charity event and bought it with gift card I won, and then used my computer to scan and copy a slimed-down version of the book rather than buy dark vengeance [i only play necrons] but he hassled me over it and I politely told him to get out of my grill and take up any problems he has with the Fair Use Copyright act. 

   I'm already part of a tourney at the store, but if he does it again, I'm going to demand my money back and drop out.

So, everyone knows that you have to pay a pre-hee-heemium for forge world models. You heard someone mention the name and hopped over to see that five Space Marines are £23, the same price tag donned by ten of games workshop's. And left.

But wait! There's more. Instead of explaining it outright, let's use the analogy of an *absurd* project to get what I mean across. I'm a space marine kinda guy, especially *Codex Astartes* types like the Ultramarines (*Boo, Hiss.*). These guys follow a very rigid chapter structure. Luckily for us, each type of company that makes up the standard chapter just got it's own *""Apocalypse Formation""* and therefore it's own one click collection. Pips. So:

* One *1^st Company Veterans*. **£663.50**
* One *Space Marine Reserve Company (Tactical)*. **£356.70**
* One *Space Marine Reserve Company (Assault)*. **£539.50**
* One *Space Marine Reserve Company (Devastator)*. **£448.00**
* One *Scout Company*. **£324.00**
* Five *Space Marine Battle Company*. **5x412= £2060.00**

For a grand total of **£4391.70**. *Jeez*.

A quick rundown of the models that contains; 400 Tactical Marines, 200 Assault Marines, 200 Devastator Marines, 50 Scouts, 50 Sniper Scouts, 25 Terminators, 25 CC Terminators, 25 Vanguard, 25 Sternguard, 11 Venerable Dreadnoughts, 9 Commanders, 9 Command Squads, 8 Chaplains, 8 Dreadnoughts, 8 Iron Dreadnoughts, 1 Terminator Commander and 1 Terminator Chaplain.

Now let's say I wanted to do a standard chapter setup. *Using MkIV Marines*.

Let's get our 400 Tacs. £1840.00. Oh wait, they don't have weapons. Arming my marines with only bolters and CCW's brings the total up to **£2280.00**. More than half the GW total already...

200 Assaults. These guys have weapons, thank the Emperor. **£1320.00**. 200 Devs, this is a little awkward as different weapons need different models. Let's go for all missiles. **£1400.00** is a nice round number for once. We can't even get FW scouts so let's omit those for now. Can't get CC Termies either, Instead we'll get 50 with powerfists and storm bolters for **£450.00**. To get are MkIV vets we have to be Red Scorpions, and it starts to get interesting. Our Vanguard come in fives, and come with some plastic parts, but I'm going to replace those plastic parts with MkIV resin parts, so we take five of these and five more sets of five assaults for **£300.00** . The Sternguard not only come in tens, with a commander too, but are also only upgrade packs so we need 25 more Tacticals along side 3 of these and 3 sets of weapons at a total of **£199.00**.

Okay, so I'm not finished but our total is already at **£5949.00** and I spent all afternoon trawling through FW like a madman with a calculator. So, we're missing 100 Scouts, 11 Venerable Dreadnoughts, 9 Commanders, 9 Command Squads, 8 Chaplains, 8 Dreadnoughts, 8 Iron Dreadnoughts, 1 Terminator Commander and 1 Terminator Chaplain; Instead we have accessories for three Red Scorpion commanders and 5 Red Scorpion vets and are already spending more than £1500 over the cost of the complete GW chapter.

So, that's that. Some guy wasted his afternoon to tell you what you already know.

Every time we play, by turn 4, I either know it's going to end by turn 5 or I'm wiped off the board. My friend's Necron army is the same, except it's usually by turn 5 if he knows the game's over or wiped off the board. 

The only time I have any sort of success against him is my long range tanks and my large, 50 man combined squads. And when I mean they work, I mean it's hard for him to assault me because of Overwatch rules. 

So my question becomes: if I'm playing a vehicle light list, do I try to out-horde him with more platoon-sized squads, do I try and put more tanks on the field if I go mech/tank heavy? His and another buddy's tyranid armies are the only one I have so much trouble (eight times out of eight, they beat me) fighting, and I need help.

So I come to the best of the best for that help! I don't need an army list, I just need basic tips to fight horde-style armies. Do I try to muck them in assault and overwatch the entire game, or do I just continue to run and shoot?

This is my third army, my first love being dark eldar, and then grey knights. I have been trying to put together a take all comers list which I intend to run in a local tourney in a few weeks. I am having a hard time finding the pulse of the codex though. 

I have a few questions for more experienced space marine players out there.

* Do you put your tac squads in rhinos/razorbacks or let them walk? I have had mixed results with this. I lean more towards getting the rhino because it is pretty cheap, but when you get one for every squad the points add up. Tactically, I feel that you don't lost anything from putting them in boxes. if the rhino gets nuked the explosion usually doesn't kill more than 1 or 2, and often none at all. You might be slowed by having to move out of the crater, but surely thats better than having our expensive troops readily exposed to shooting nastiness. I can't really figure out why rhinos have ""gone out of style"". But, maybe thats why I can't make my marines win.

* Is it just me or are assault squads bad? I like the models, I like the mobility, I worry about having no cc troops to push enemy off objective, so I feel like assault squads should be a no brainer. In practice though, they almost always let me down. They get shot to ribbons if I deep strike them, and if I just run them up the board they are either blasted to uselessness or savvy opponents screen them from ever reaching the back field with something that just eats them. I readily admit that I have failed in my attempts to make assault squads a contributing part of my list. How do you guys use them? 

* What is your strategy/game plan with vanilla marines, and how do you execute it? 

* What is the unit you never leave home without?

* (edit) has anyone tried Shrike and a ten man assault squad infiltrating? In my head this would work beautifully, but I wonder if anyone has tried this.",,False,self,t5_2rr81,1350436432.0,,,True,t3_11ky09,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/11ky09/how_do_you_win_with_vanilla_marines/,

Also because i HATE the kroot model (sorry kroot fans). back to the point, as someone relatively new to the hobby i found myself in a severe lack of pathfinders, Ive got 4 lovely pewter fine casts that need a coat of paint.  fielding 4 pathfinders is almost a waste, and i still had the gears in the back of my mind running wild. so i did it i bought some pathfinder bits, some bases, and a lot of 12 lizardmen skinks.  so today i got most of my bits, sans pathfinder carbine arms, in this morning, and would like to share my first steps into my very first conversion project. help a new modeler out and leave some C&amp;C.

so a friend and I picked up Dark Vengeance a few weeks ago, and we have been theory crafting **a lot**.  Like, all the damn time.  So here's the ""problem"" that I see with every list that I've made so far:
**A balanced army can do well against a balanced army, but not against a power play army (tons of flyers, tons of heavy tanks, etc).**  While there are counters available, I don't see how a balanced army could field enough missile launchers with flakk (or meltas and lascannons) to possibly cope with such a niche army. This subreddit has a lot of ""Your army does well against army type X, but not so much against army type Y.  Fix that.""  But after the ""fix"", the army no longer does quite *as* well vs X, although it does do *better* vs Y.  So would I have to collect enough models to field specific counters?  Or simply hope that I never play against a niche army?  Thanks.

    (A back story to this concern: My friend really likes Heldrakes 
    (from Codex: CSM), and he wants to run 3 of them.  And possibly
    a demon prince with wings.  At the moment, we're looking at 1500pt
    armies)",,False,self,t5_2rr81,False,,,True,t3_1b4n7r,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1b4n7r/as_a_new_player_i_have_some_questions_about/,

But, despite having a bunch of Unpainted guys I and my friends decided to run through a 600 pts game and I've made my first list 

* Ork Warboss 
  * Mega Armor
  * BossPole                               

* 5 Nobs 
  * make one a Painboy 
  * Give all 4 Cybork Bodyparts

  * 1 Bosspole                       

* 3 Deffkoptas

And i have picked up some boxes of different types of models for Blood Angels. And painted some of them.
Now i know i have not removed mould lines, as i just keep on forgetting about them until it feels like too late, i am going to start working on removing them.
And the pictures in the album, the colors are kind of changed to what they look like, so also wondering how to take good pictures so that they come out on pics, as they should.
The Dreadnought is the picture closest to all the red models real color.

So I was wondering what colours would the Ultramarines turn if they had been the heretics, or the blood angels? Which gods would they worship the most?


I think this alternate universe where the legions' situation is reversed would be interesting as you would get new unique Chaos units (Maybe no more berserkers or noise marines, but something different) and the loyalists would have the Emperor's children and such on their side with their special units.

The squad of Imperial Guard veterans weren't his concern right now.  The tank had already fired its full arsenal at him and caused him a wound to his side.  It hurt, but he had to fight on.


Using his Turbo-penetrator ammo, he fired at an exposed fuel port and managed to destroy the tank.  It exploded into fiery ruins.


He ran back around the ruins to attempt to get into firing position on another of the lumbering tanks. Making himself barely visible, he took his chances and fired his Turbo-penetrator ammo again.  This shot hit its mark, but it wasn't strong enough to destroy the tank outright.  The tracks became stuck, immobilising the vehicle.  His comrades in the Land Raider would have to deal with it from here, as the Imperial Guard veterans were converging on his position.


They fired a volley of shots at the assassin, but he dodged them easily.  Seeing no other choice, he charged the squad.  He easily shot down 3 of the veterans, and they were unable to wound him.  They broke under his stern gaze and attempted to flee.  He killed them as they ran.


His comrades were mopping up another squad of veterans, and he assumed that the leadership of the imperial guardsman was taken care of as well.


He fired at a third tank and easily destroyed that one, as well.


The broken tank, however, still had guns to fire.  It fired upon his commanding officer and comrades and destroyed them in a blaze of plasma.


The entire battle hinged on this moment.  He loaded another Turbo-penetrator round, took aim, and fired at the exposed fuel tank.  The Leman Russ exploded in a large fireball, illuminating the carnage around him.


And he stood alone. Amidst the charred bodies of his comrades were the bodies of Guardsmen.  They all fought with honor, and died like men.

The one in the arm is sticking out half way and goes into the hand. This combined with the way the right arm naturally fits into the body (no magnet needed here) makes it possible to pick them up from the weapon and even shake them around without the body flying off.

After a very hungover Sunday reading the amazing Dornian heresy and other alternate heresies, I have decided that I am finally going to try my hand at an alternate heresy, in which Sanguinius is the arch-traitor and the traitor/loyalist legions are reversed. The loyalist legions were still split into hundreds/thousands smaller chapters, however Abbadon's Imperial decree allowed the original legions to retain larger numbers.

My alternate heresy will consist of fan-fluff, a wiki, art, and perhaps even some miniatures. I hope to develop the story behind this in the future, and get it to the level of Dornian heresy or even further!

So first of all, here is a basic list of the legion allegiances and why.

----------------------------------------- Traitor ------------------------------------------------------

Blood Angels: The legion of Sanginius, the demon-winged arch traitor. They are the largest remaining chaos legion, and ruled over by Mephiston, champion of Chaos. There are several different elite formations within the blood angels dedicated to different gods, from the Khornate Death Company to the Slaaneshi Sanguinary Guard. Known to form large Blood Crusades, and wield daemons and cult marines of all forms in battle. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ultramarines: Their celebrated and elite status eventually lead to arrogance, elitism, and hubris. This attracted Slaanesh to the legion, and in their pursuit to become as celebrated and elite as possible, devoted their souls and bodies to the dark prince.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Salamanders: The diseased, plague-ridden legions of the Salamanders raze world after world in the name of their patron Nurgle, using  fire to destroy all non-infected life, replacing it with fields of waste and decay. The Salamanders always cared for their mortal inferiors far more than other Astartes, however this gentle care evolved to a suffocating embrace which saw desire to see their friends and subjects live forever, even as poxed zombies...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

White Scars: Their once white armour now stained a permanent red, the White Scars rape and pillage their way across the galaxy in the name of the blood god, Khorne. The White Scars were a tribal and war-weary legion long before their discovery by the Emperor, and years of battle in the great crusade only reawakened their bloodlust. This rediscovered bloodlust attracted the lord of blood, Khorne, and the rest is history..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iron Hands: Formerly a legion of technical might, the Iron Hands pursuit of technical knowledge led them to blindly chasing the Machine God, the source of all knowledge, and methods for using science and arcane magic to predict the future. However, this 'machine god' of knowledge and machinery turned out to be Tzeentch, The Lord of Change. Now, utilising twisted and unreal mixtures of daemon and flesh, as well as eldritch magics seen to them as 'programming', the blue-turqouise Iron Hands march to battle.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Space Wolves: A legion of brutal, cold warriors who hate the taint of chaos and its sorcery as much as they hate the imperium they saw as abandoning them. This isolation and hatred of all things bought them into the service of Malal, the Renegade god. They are known to carry enchanted axes called 'dreadaxes' to drain chaotic power, and march into battle with intent to destroy all.

Imperial Fists: Undivided, and do not particularly worship chaos. Generally they oppose it, but may use it if different. They saw the Tyranid threat in a vision long before the Heresy, and believed fracturing the Imperium into distant petty empires would starve the tyranids of large amounts of human genes. They still aim to divide the Imperium by destroying its many fortifications, and walling imperial cities in, often until air runs out. While their original intentions were pure, by the 41st millenium they have reached rather high levels of corruption in some warbands. The Khornate Crimson Fists are an example of this.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Raven Guard: Worshippers of Chaos Undivided who are low in number, but high in threat to the Imperium. They are mostly comprised of hideous, avian marines in jet black raptor/warp talon armour who offer their services to the highest bidder. Several abominations of their Primarch's creation act as chaos spawn, chained in their ships but unleashed on the battlefield when needed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dark Angels: The Dark Angels are a mysterious legion, about which little is known. They are worshippers of Chaos Undivided, and venerate the ruinous powers as a pantheon. They are known for hunting their jet-black brothers which remained loyal, also known to the Imperium as the Legion of the Damned. Little is known about the true intentions behind their cloaks of heretical markings, but what is known is that it is pure evil..

you get commander farsight who can take a bodyguard of 7 crisis suits and he can deepstrike with his unit without scattering and then you give all 7 of those crisis suits 1 flamer and 1 twin linked flamer.

you just plonk the unit on he board and flame everything and then your opponent pretty much has to assault your unit and then you'll have 14d3 overwatch hits with half of them rerolling to wound and an initiative 5 commander farsight with 4 attacks and a S5 AP2 armourbane weapon.

I liked the small squads and quick battles as each match had a 30 minute time limit.

The store had 6-3'x4' tables set up, 2 were urban city set ups, packed with buildings and elevation, 2 were more open with minimal terrain such as light ruins and vegetation, and the last 2 were more densely packed with low ruins and rubble. Which table and opponents you played was sort of by draw.

With my Tau I won 1 match and lost 3, playing against Space Marines, Chaos Marines, Imperial Guard, and Tau. And even the matches I lost I felt pretty competitive with my troop choices up until the match time expired.

Personally, I would like a really great first-person 40K console game. I think a great format would be a lone Fire Warrior/Space Marine/Shock Trooper trapped aboard a Space Hulk which is partially infested with both Orkz and Tyranids.

Basically, for the first half of the game, you'd be having to deal with frontal attacks by groups of Orkz while being stalked by Tyranids, though you'd never really see much of them-- you might see an occasional flitting shadow, or see an Ork pulled into an air vent or something, but it would just serve to increase tension. Then all hell would break loose and it would turn into a massive Genestealer-v-Ork battle as you're trying to fight your way to a rescue ship.

As far as what the characters would be capable of, the Fire Warrior would have the best ranged capability, the Shock Trooper would be a balanced character, and the Space Marine would have the best hand-to-hand combat skill.

Basically, I would like to see a game that's first-person and that actually makes really good use of the sneaky, fear-inspiring elements of some of the Tyranid types. I think some RPG elements would also be really cool, like scavenging weapons from dead Orkz and Guardsmen.

Despite the grammatical errors, this video really educated me on the history &amp; current state of the Imperium.  Back when I started playing in 3rd edition for whatever reason I was under the impression that basically Space Marines were unstoppable &amp; the imperium was more or less running the galaxy.  

Now we all know that is completely wrong, but for whatever reason that is how WH40K was interpreted/marketed to me.  It may have been my limited income at the time or perhaps not having access to the internet etc

I had no idea who the Emperor was, that the horus heresy even occured or that there were primarchs.  I had no idea that the Imperium in its current state is more or less f*cked as life support devices sustaining the emperors life are failing which will prevent navigation of the warp.

Having learned all of this just recently it made me fall in love with the WH40k universe all over again.  I sold my Ultramarines army &amp; used the money to start a Imperial Guard army as they are mortal men fighting superhuman xenos with little more than a lasgun &amp; their courage.  

The 40k universe is darker than I could have ever imagined &amp; would recommend the above video to anyone curious about 40k.

1. Introduction

WHAT IS ZAS!?
Zombie Apocalypse Survival at its heart is a table top survival horror where you as a player take control of a single model and work as part of a team to carry out missions set in an apocalypse of undead proportions. You must set aside your differences and work as a team in order to meet these objectives, there is no place for lone wolves in ZAS.

HOW DID IT COME TO THIS!?
You were sent to this world in order to quell an uprising/fight off an Ork invasion/purge Xenos/cleanse a Chaos Cult.
For the time being it does not really matter what you came here for (although we will explore this later), a more pressing matter is what is now the reason you feel it is best to leave this planet for.
Basically, Nurgle has done it again and through occult means or general shenanigans has turned a significant proportion of the planets current population into flesh hungry zombies.
You, either through the Emperor’s/Dark god’s (delete as appropriate) blessing, or blind luck have been spared of this terrible fate for the time being, and now whatever seemed important before suddenly takes a lower spot on your priorities. 
On the bright side, that rebellion is now under control and those damn unionists at the ammunition factories are no longer pushing for more ration tokens. This is however partially due to their new found diet.
For the time being your main focus should be to put a fair distance between yourself and these poor souls, preferably through means of an orbit capable ship.  
These terrible monsters are all for equal opportunities, and do not discriminate when their food is concerned, to them everything is fair game and you might not like it but if you do want to survive this ordeal you will have to work with those who you might otherwise deem undesirable. 

WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO!?
At the very minimum you should work to try and stay alive. If we are thinking bigger then you should be hoping to either escape, or hold out long enough for rescue to arrive, but don’t count on it, the galaxy is a big place and one planet will not be missed, more likely is that a contingent of the Ordo Maleus will arrive to see to it that you do not make it out, as zombie planets do not contribute positively to the Imperium’s PR.

2. THE GAME!!!
Overview
There are two ways that ZAS can be played, with a Games Master or Without, and what one you choose largely depends on type of game you want to play.
If you are looking for a narrative experience and dramatic story then I would suggest you nominate a player to take the role of the games master, who will dictate the various actions of the monsters and orchestrate the events that you will be witness to.
If you do not want to use a Games Master then do not worry as it only contributes to a narrative aspect, there are rules set in place that mean the monsters actions can be automatically determined. This means that you can all play your characters and when the time comes for the monsters to make their move you will use a table of their behavioural traits to determine their actions.
Phases
Not unlike 40k there are 3 phases to a turn, movement, shooting, and Close combat (although it is not recommended to enter into close combat with a highly infectious abomination that is spilling various nasty fluids with every step).

The movement phase is carried out as normal, however there will be certain factors and character traits that can have effects on a players movement, for example what you are moving over, if you are climbing or have to make a jump to reach your destination. Your characters stats and abilities will play a big part in how mobile you can be. The movement phase can also be used to undertake certain actions so long as you do not move or move very little, such as opening a door, picking a lock, hacking a terminal etc.

The shooting phase also works like 40k.Rolls to hit are still the same, and rolling to wound is still largely the same (however there is a slight change to this).
Factors such as your movement, how much danger you are in how long you want to spend making a shot, and how fast your target is moving can play a part on how successful you are in your marksmanship. These will be covered later.

It should also be noted that your characters ballistic skill will play just as large a part in how easy it is to wound your target, as your weapons strength. A wise man once said “AIM FOR THE HEAD!” and this applies to ZAS. All conventional zombies have an armour save and your ballistic skill plays a part in how successful you will be at making those crucial headshots that negate the save.

For example a guardsman with a BS of 3 will roll to hit and need a 4+ to make the successful shot. 
He rolls a 4!
Well done soldier, now your las-rifle has strength 3 so on a regular zombie you will need a further 4+ to wound. 
He rolls a 4! Close shave laddie it looks like you hurt it!
But oh no what is this!? 
The zombie rolls his armour save and makes it! 
Unaffected by your poor shooting! 
If only you had rolled a 5+ to hit! Then you would have hit the head and destroyed the brain, in turn destroying the zombie!
This works much like the rending rule as seen in the 40k main rulebook but it is the characters BS that depends on what they need to get that rending value, a Space marine for example with BS 4 will cause rending on a 4+ since their excellent marksmanship is the stuff of legend, and while the bolter would not normally allow armour saves from the zombies due to their amour piercing value this rending can take effect on larger more deadly monsters. 
The shooting phase can also be used to undertake certain actions much like the movement phase.

THE COMBAT PHASE! Unless you are lucky enough to be in something equal to or better than power armour I would not recommend going into close combat by choice as zombies travel in packs and can easily overwhelm small groups of survivors.

If you do find yourself in CC with one of the monsters you can choose to try fight it and this would be done through conventional close combat rules. However it is recommended that you disengage from the melee especially if it seems like more baddies will be turning up. 
This is done by taking a “disengage test”.
If you are locked in combat with a single zombie you roll a dice, on a 2+ you disengage and move a distance equal to your initiative away.
However if there is two of the beasties you will need to roll a 3+.
If there are 4-7 zombies are going to need a 4+, playing with fire here buddy.
8-15 of the beasts and you are looking at a 5+ to get out of this one.
16 or more of the bastards and it’s a 6+ to successfully disengage.
This is to help represent the idea of all those dirty hands clutching at your characters limbs. Now it is understandable that some characters will find it easier than others to escape for example the agile elder or jump infantry (but if you have a jetpack what are you even still doing here?) These characters will have these traits mentioned in their profile with details of how they affect the disengage test.

Infection, if a monster makes an unsaved wound against a player regardless of how many wounds a player has left the character must take a toughness test.
If you roll a value equal to or under your toughness you are fine (bikes do NOT make you more capable of fighting off toxins). 
If you roll over your toughness value however then you are infected, your wounds are restored to full and you join the horde until the end of the mission or until you are put down.
As a member of the infected you keep all your stats and war gear but lose any ability to shoot/make actions such as open doors/ cast psychic powers or anything that requires a certain degree of intelligence. 
The abilities of infected players will be covered later in the characters section. 

3. CHARACTERS

The characters in ZAS use the same stats and abilities as those in 40k, however as a player is controlling a single model instead of an entire army there is a certain extra degree of depth given to players not unlike roleplaying games, for example kicking a door in, which would require a strength test or hacking a computer which would require an initiative test.
A characters speciality will also lend to these types of actions, for example a space marine does not care about how thick the padlock is on your door, it is getting kicked in. And a tech-priest couldn’t care less about your mother’s maiden name and all but the most complicated of programs and machinery are but child’s play for them to navigate and manipulate.
It would take hundreds of pages to list all possible characters specialities and how they could affect different actions, and I am not doing that, it is down to the players or the Game Master to exercise common sense and imagination when determining these things.

When you are building your character you will use your codex and take the points value from that, there is a points budget for a squad that is determined by the amount of players in the squad, and while you can go over budget there are rules in place that will make things more difficult for you if you do. In a campaign setting and as characters find more cool gear and level up this points budget will increase to reflect your group scavenging and becoming a better team.

Please note, that it would be easy to all just pick thunder hammer/storm shield terminators and steam roll through the mindless hordes, but is this really the game you want to play? 

ZAS is a narrative experience and while it is cool to just brutalise your way through a bunch of poor zombies with all of your awesome gear and mad stats, where is the challenge in that? Would a group of space marines really be deployed to take care of a small group of zombies? Not likely, however it could be that they are sent to go deal with the larger threat and more deadly monsters, while it is not something that I feel would be an issue with most gaming groups for the sake of prudence I must stress that it is a character’s flaws what make them interesting, not how easily they can wreck a horde of zombies. If it has always been your dream to be Kaldor Driago then by all means play him in ZAS but just remember that you are not the only one playing and a game where a one man daemon prince spanking, garden of Nurgle burning, warp walking machine will be a very dull for someone else who might be a single imperial guardsman. When making your character don’t be an asshole.
That said having a single space marine helping a group of guardsmen reach evacuation is not something entirely out of the question at all. For the sake of the narrative just exercise a degree of restraint. 

Normal humans such as Imperial guard will not receive any bonuses to their stat line when making certain tests, and must rely on their war gear to assist them in making an action that they otherwise could not make (using a melta to open a locked door for example)

Augmented humans such as tech priests or members of the mechanicus will receive +1 bonuses to their Initiative and toughness when making a test to see if they can access terminals or machinery or if they need to make a toughness test (this +1 is not added to their toughness when the monster is rolling to wound, only when they take the “infection test”)
Depending on their augmentations there may also be a +1 to their strength when making a test to see if they can break a door down or move an obstacle, mechatendrils for example. 

Astartes both loyal and renegade have +2 to their strength and toughness for action tests due to their enhanced strength (further enhanced by their armour) and their ability to break down toxins within their body. It will always take a roll of 6 to infect a space marine.
A Tech-marine will also receive the same bonuses to their rolls as members of the mechanicus.
If a space marine is infected and bites another player, that player receives a negative modifier on their armour save by negative one (e.g. 5+save becomes 6+) due to the space marine’s acid glands. 
An infected space marine cannot be rended when rolling to wound like mentioned earlier in the shooting phase, due to their thick armour. The only way to make sure that an infected space marine does not get their armour save is to use a weapon with AP3 or less.
When in CC with an infected space marine there is also a negative modifier to the characters disengage test by negative one. This is due to their increased strength. (Disregard this rule when infected space marine is in CC with an Eldar player)

Eldar (dark elder included) all rend on a roll of 4+ due in part to their excellent marksmanship, and receive a +1 modifier to their disengage tests as a result of their inhuman agility, this takes place even if they are in close combat with infected space marines.

Orks are only infected on a roll of 6+, and receive a +2 to their strength tests and a Negative one to all initiative tests. 

Tau receive a +1 to all initiative tests.

When can we expect new Tau, Imp Guard?",TeddyRoostervelt,18,1,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/1a39kv/does_anyone_here_know_about_the_rumors_concerning/,"I was also wondering about the arc of the story line. Currently, a lot of codexs and fluff hint at possible returns of heros (certain primarchs were ""missing"" and Roboute Guilliman is fabled to be doing a comeback. also the emperor technically isn't dead, sanguinor is the reincarnation of sanguinius), secret technology that could turn the fate of the universe (Grey Knights have all sorts of shenanigans), necrons awakening, tyranids are still pulling their crap on a galactic scale, etc. Is GW ever going to advance the story by 10,000 years again? Will we ever be let off the cliff hanger?
