Also, please only delete your recipes! If you delete something from the dropbox, it gets deleted for everybody!

UPDATE: So, we have had some discussions about changing the medium... if everyone could poll [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGhsUTlqYmZtVHl5STFremdnVW8tSkE6MQ) so we can figure out what our next step is..

This sparked from a wonderful post in /r/secretsanta and we would like to share it with everyone. We know /r/recipes exists, and it is filled with a bunch of glorious foods. But what if we had a cookbook that we could all contribute to? One where if you want the best filet mignon recipe, you head to the meats folder. If you want bacon wrapped chicken, you go to the poultry folder?

This is all possible through a public dropbox. A system that allows you to share files between desktops and mobile phones. I use it at work so why not use it for fun too??

If you already have dropbox, feel free to PM me your e-mail so I can share the folder with you. If you DON'T have dropbox, here is my referral link thing: http://db.tt/M8haimVm

Let's make this one of the greatest cookbooks anyone can find!

EDIT: Here is the link to the dropbox. I'm about to add a recipe myself so it's pretty bare :( But please, add add add!!  https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w9dres6dypimg3q/ejLKoEFfo0 (if the link does something screwy, please let me know)

Also, if you download dropbox to your desktop, every time someone adds something, a little notification pops up! Which I think is pretty cool..


EDIT2: There is a discussion going on between using scoop and level measurements (i.e. 1 cup) and using a food scale. What would you all prefer? Also a conversion chart has been added to the dropbox.

EDIT3: So I'm sitting here watching recipes POUR into the cookbook, you guys are truly amazing! Keep them rolling! We also just learned that something you have added may not necessarily pop up instantly in everyone else's box, so be a bit patient :)",,False,,t5_2qh7f,1338931502.0,,,True,t3_um4ea,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/um4ea/good_morning_all_i_have_a_bit_of_an_idea_reddits/,

When adding diced potatoes to a soup or stew, do the following:

1) Don't bother washing or peeling the potatoes

2) Dice the potatoes up and put into a large bowl -- not your pot!

3) Fill the bowl with cold water, enough to cover the potatoes.   Notice how grainy and starchy and cloudy the water is.  That would normally be your soup, we don't want that!

4) Let soak for only a few minutes, then empty the water and rinse the potatoes.  

5) Fill up and rinse your potatoes one more time.  

6) Drain all water as best you can.

7) NOW add the potatoes to the soup

8) Cook the soup for an additional 25-35 minutes and the potatoes should be done.


The result is that your soup isn't starchy or cloudy or grainy, and the potatoes are soft, creamy and melt in your mouth.

Don't add the potatoes in too soon -- if you're really cooking your soup a long time to let the flavors come together, or to get flavors from meat or bones, only add potatoes at the very end when there's 25-35 minutes left of high-temp cooking.  We don't want them to turn to mush!

1367866040.0,686,self.Cooking,1dt3gt,super old-school Bolognese recipe,PincheIdiota,835,149,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1dt3gt/super_oldschool_bolognese_recipe/,"Hey r/cooking.  I posted this as a comment, but figured I'd throw it up here as well.  This is the best tasting Bolognese recipe I've ever found.  Hope you like it!

I poached this recipe from a crazy old Milanese chef who worked as a consultant opening an Italian restaurant back in 2003ish. (I was a line cook then-executive chef now). His bolognese and gnocchi recipes are the two best things I've ever committed to memory. This recipe is a pain in the ass, but it's really good. Here's the Bolo - this should be scaled down if you're doing it in a home kitchen. 

I make this in a big square braising pan in a restaurant kitchen, or my big Le Creuset dutch oven if i'm doing it at home.

Pull the leaves off about 2 linear feet of fresh rosemary (1oz ish whole) Sauté those for 30 seconds with ten bay leaves in about a cup of medium hot olive oil.

Add 8# yellow onion, 3# celery, and 3# carrot and let cook for 5-10 minutes. To prep these, just process them until they're tiny in a food processor - when all's said and done, they basically vanish into the sauce. Cook em until they sweat over heat that is high enough to hear, but don't let them brown or burn. If you keep them moving with a wooden spoon it works well.

Next add: 10# ground beef, 5#ground pork, and 5# ground veal and cook over high heat until the the meat is all browned and cooked through. I use a potato masher during this step to break up the meat and keep it moving. Punch little holes in your meat pile with a small (1-2oz) ladle and skim out as much fat as you can and discard.

Puree 1# chicken livers and small dice (or food process) 1.5# mortadella (baloney works too on the cheap). Add them to the meat and cook over high heat (scraping the bottom constantly with your flat-edged wooden spoon) until the liver liquid coating the meat takes on a rusty orange color - 2-5 minutes probably.

Now add 2# tomato paste. You want this to cook until it turns rusty orange too. Keep scraping with your spoon so nothing burns on the bottom of the pan.

The next step can be done a few different ways. Mario used to add about about 3/4# beef base and a gallon or so of water. This is the one point in this recipe that i've accomplished in many different ways. The purpose of this is to add salt, meat flavor and liquid to simmer the sauce down with. I've done it successfully with chicken stock and salt, canned chicken broth (1 gallonish), boullion cubes and water. The ABSOLUTE FUCKING BEST WAY is to throw about 3# veal demi-glace in with a few quarts of water or stock. You can buy demi frozen at butcher shops, restaurant supply shops, and some nice grocery stores. It gives the sauce phenomenal depth and mouthfeel.

This is also the time to add three or four bottles of big red wine.

The sauce will look like a watery meat soup now. Turn the heat down to low and let it simmer and reduce. Hit the bottom of the pan like a zamboni with your wooden spoon every now and then to make sure no hot-spots are sabotaging your sauce-fetus as it develops. It'll take a few hours, but this is where the magic slips in and smashes all of the differing notes of gigantic deliciousness into a harmonious meat opus that will absolutely get you laid. 

It is ready to go once the liquid has reduced to the point that it looks like tight sloppy joe mix. Or meat coated with ketchup. A good way to know for sure - lift some out of the pot on your wooden spoon. It should be tight enough that you get a mound of meat on the spoon standing half as tall as the spoon is wide.

You there? Great. Throw a pound of unsalted butter into the sauce to celebrate. Mix it around until it melts, then hit it with a handful or two of finely chopped fresh parsley, thyme and rosemary. Also taste it and add some salt and black pepper as needed.

A lot of Bolo recipes include canned tomatoes and milk. This one is super old-school Emilia-Romagna and keeps the dairy and tomato components separate until you finish the dish.

To finish:  In a large pot, heat the bolognese with smaller amounts of tomato sauce and veloute or alfredo. You can also just add heavy cream. At the restaurant, we used 8oz bolo, 3oz tomato sauce, and 2oz veloute per person. Also throw in a tablespoon of whole butter. While it's getting hot, drop your pasta (something with grip: pappardelle, tagliatelle, fettucine, rigatoni, and cavatappi all work well.) in boiling, salted (1 T salt : 1 gallon) water, and cook it until it's done. Not sure if it's done? Pull a piece out every minute once it starts to soften up and bite it. Look where you bit - is there a white line in the middle of the cross section? If so, keep cooking until there isn't.

Pull the pasta out of the water and drop it into the sauce. Add a little of the water from the pasta to the pan if it looks too dry. Let that all cook together for about a minute over medium heat. The sauce should permeate the noodles and cling to them. You're almost there. Throw a big pinch (golf ball sized?) of grated parmesan (or similar cheese) in and toss it around. TASTE IT - add salt and/or cheese as necessary.

Plate that in a big pasta bowl by spinning tongs in your noodle pan until you have a softball sized clump of food-material attached, and drop that in the bowl, spinning the tongs as you release to build a little hive of awesomeness in the center. Spatula any remaining sauce on top of your noodle pile. Top that with more grated parm, black pepper, and drizz a couple teaspoons of olive oil over the top.  Boom.

That's because you're blind now, Mildred.

Thanks for all the comments!  I'll put together a scaled down version in the next couple days and get to work on the gnocchi.",,False,,t5_2qh7f,1367887393.0,,,True,t3_1dt3gt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1dt3gt/super_oldschool_bolognese_recipe/,

[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/x7hf5/quick_diet_friendly_meals/c5k1buz)
Anyway, here it is.

-----
So my girlfriend and I went an a diet a few weeks ago, calorie counting. However, I'm a good, proud (fat) Italian American and wasn't about to sacrifice having good dinners.

So, I have effectively mastered the 500 calorie dinner haha. Well, at the very least it keeps my stomach, taste buds, and most importantly girlfriend happy.

What to buy:

* Chicken breast, and a lot of it! Chicken breast is at most 40 calories per ounce, more like 35!

* Onions
* Broccoli

* Red/green/orange peppers

*  Mushrooms

*  Asparagus

* Carrots

*  Cabbage

* Tomato

Spices/seasonings:

Wet:

* Red/White Wine
*  Balsamic Vinegar
*  Worcestershire sauce
* Soy sauce

Dry:

* Garlic Powder (or garlic salt)
* Onion Powder
*  Cumin
* Garam Masala
* Beau Monde
* Kosher salt
*  Chili Powder
* Italian seasoning (some mixture of oregano, basil, thyme, etc)
*  Cilantro

OK, so, now is when you get creative. Every day, pick about 3 veggies, 2 wet spices, and 3 dry spices.

Cut chicken into cubes.

In a pan over medium-high to high heat, brown chicken. I like to spray a bit of Pam Olive Oil (or equivalent) on the chicken to get things going. Add your dry ingredients (1tsp-1tbsp) and one of your wet ingredients (1/8 cup) at this point (wine if you're using it). Once the chicken is nice and white, start stirring in harder veggies like onions, peppers, or carrots. All of these should be diced.

Saute for a few minutes. Onions should start to turn clear, peppers should start to become tender.

Add your other liquid at this point. (1/8 cup)

Throw in the rest of your veggies, turn the heat down, and cover (if you can. Steaming does wonders, but it will work well enough without a lid. ) If it starts looking a bit dry, add 1/8 cup water.

Dinner is ready when your kitchen smells awesome. (10-20 mins)

Examples: Mexican- Peppers, tomato and onions, cumin, garlic powder, chili powder, and about 1tbsp Worcestershire and balsamic vinegar.

Indian- Onion, broccoli, carrots, garam masala, garlic powder, italian seasoning, red wine, and balsamic vinegar.

Nondescript Asian- Broccoli, mushroom, cabbage, onion powder, garlic powder, rice wine vinegar (or white wine), soy sauce

Italian- Onion, tomato, asparagus, mushroom, garlic powder (or go for fresh for this one), Italian seasoning, red wine, and a bit of balsamic. Add the tomatoes in early on this one (with the onions).

American(?)- broccoli, carrots, cabbage or asparagus, onion powder, garlic powder, white wine, 1-2tbps Worcestershire

In general- Pick something green, something red, one more color for your veggies. Then, add liquids you think would go well (they all will probably), and any of the seasonings really haha. All of this will go well together.

You can, in most cases, eat literally a pound of this stuff and be at or under 500 calories. Oh, also, this is a 1 pan meal. 

Feel free to PM me with questions too

Hope this helps some of you out!

[UPDATE]",rsl12,829,226,226,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/122f29/if_pasta_tastes_better_when_you_add_salt_to_the/,"[I asked this question two weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/11bb05/if_pasta_tastes_better_when_you_add_salt_to_the/) and you were kind enough to give me lots of feedback.  But as no one had a definitive answer, I decided to send the question to two pasta manufacturers: Barilla and Dececco.  Dececco never answered (perhaps because my Italian isn't that great), but here's the answer from Barilla:

&gt; Salt is always used in preparing pasta in Italy. A touch of salt in the water brings out the flavor of the pasta. Sea salt is recommend since it is a natural product that enhances the flavor without creating salty-tasting pasta. However, adding salt to the pasta water is based on the consumer's preference and is not required. Therefore, we do not add salt to our pasta so everyone can enjoy pasta the way they like it. 

**EDIT:** [Qasph points out](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/122f29/if_pasta_tastes_better_when_you_add_salt_to_the/c6rqqgn) that, by Italian law, store-bought pasta can only be made of 100% durum semolina flour and water only, no other ingredients. Of course, this makes me want to ask a whole new set of questions...  

* [English-language link--look under the ""wheat and water"" section](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/122f29/if_pasta_tastes_better_when_you_add_salt_to_the/c6rqqgn)

**EDIT 2:** The law was established in 1967 originally requiring all pasta sold in Italy to adhere to the standard, but [partially overturned in 1988](http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-14/news/mn-8941_1_pasta-makers).

1356795777.0,572,self.Cooking,15mkpm,Why a high-end knife is probably not for you,DTNKnives,783,211,319,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/15mkpm/why_a_highend_knife_is_probably_not_for_you/,"First off, I am a *huge* fan of high-end cutlery. I *make* high end cutlery, as a result. With that said, for the investment to actually be justifiable, I don't think most people are prepared for what's actually required to use an expensive knife.

I'll use the cliche analogy of the car around a track. The average car, even sports car, will drive pretty well, and get you around (usually). If you are a *nut* and like to do it in extreme fashion, then perhaps a race car is in order. You can't just drive a race car and expect it to maintain itself - there's a buttload of maintenance and babying. The ""normal"" car, however, requires minimal maintenance in comparison. Same deal with knives.

**An expensive knife is made to tailor to very specific details that are negligible to most people.** I can imagine that most of us don't care if the balance of a knife is 1 cm in front of the bolster or 1.5 cm. We probably don't care that a knife cuts *too* well, but is 10 grams too light. The tip of the knife is 0.2mm too thin and can flex 1 cm more than we want to. On certain non-carbon steel knives, the feedback on sharpening stones is a bit gummy and the burr is a little more stubborn. The edge holds extremely well, but takes 160% more effort/time to get there.

Yes, knife nuts will pick those out. Those details are what makes an expensive knife expensive (because it takes so darn long to make it that way!).

**An expensive knife will only cut as well as it was intended if it's babied.** This doesn't mean honing it with a rod whenever it's starting to cut less than ideal. It can include getting a high-end cutting board, never letting the edge make unnecessary contact (and I mean never), washing separately, wiping/drying after every cutting session, storing it correctly, stropping/touching up regularly, and properly sharpening when the edge needs to get freshened up. In case you're wondering, the point of a good knife isn't to hold a factory edge forever, but to hold a balance of ease of sharpening and edge stability - it's *meant* to be sharpened and even thinned when the time comes.

Honing with a rod can only get the edge so far. This approach is only for quick, *rough* touch ups. The cheapo grooved rods don't even work on high-end knives, because they're used to realign softer edges and rip out weaker parts of the edge. A high-end knife is hard, really hard. There generally is no realigning, hence stropping on a stone or loaded strop is what's most commonly used to touch up an edge. A good ceramic rod can be used for a quick refresh, but the limitations have to be understood.

Going back to the hardness of the knife, it allows for a *very* acute edge angle. Now think about this - you have a very hard, almost brittle steel with an acute angle (thinner cross section). It's super easy to chip that edge. This means, like I said above, no unnecessary contact - with sinks, forks, spoons, bowls, plates, counter, soup cans, *bones*, other knives, hard plastics/woods, etc. Cut only things that were meant to be cut. Use a different knife for bone and lobster crushing.

-
To summarize, biggest things to consider are babying the knife to keep it in good condition, and being able to get it to that condition through proper touch ups and sharpenings. You pretty much have to know how to sharpen a knife well, or at the very least be able to strop it (and then send it to someone who *can* sharpen it). A good ceramic rod is an OK alternative, but with limitations.
-

To get an idea, these things start being a big deal starting at $200 and up. 

If some of these practices are not for you, a really expensive knife is probably not for you. If you only use a grooved honing rod for touching up, anything above a Victorinox Fibrox is probably not worth the investment. 

Finishing off, the most important part is maintenance and you can really get your money's worth out of any knife if you can sharpen and touch up with stones. A Fibrox will shine if kept well (honestly, a Fibrox taken care of well is enough for most situations). A Global or Shun will shine a bit more if kept well. 

**EDIT: I should have put these here earlier. Here is a list of affordable tools, and a list of maintenance tips.**

My father had three restaurants in France. One of them visited by a French president himself. Our restaurant was facing the Louvre and got free advertising on French national radio because it was that good. Later on, I opened a restaurant with a friend in studio city in Los Angeles that made the Zagat twice. One time, in 2000, “best personal restaurant in Los Angeles”, and in 2001, they called us “top notch”. The present governor of California came on a weekly basis and may other folks. Our setting was intimate. Our cuisine was magnificent. The product we served was hand picked at three in the morning. We snatched the goods from big restaurant names because their chefs were too lazy to do the trip to the early morning markets. Mexicans filet makers loved us. Fresh vegetables kept their best in their backrooms for us. We ruled LA for three years and sold the darn joint in time before the economic collapse. Because I love reddit, once a week I will give you one of our recipe. Fuck you if you want to hate, enjoy if you find these recipe attractive. These recipe will need passion and work.

Veal stock:

Get three big bones of veal. I don't care how you find the darn thing. Kill it yourself for all I care, just get some darn veal bones. Pick a large Aluminum or stainless steal bowl. Put the bone in it with marrow showing. Usually neck bones are the best. Add a pinch of rock salt, two tablespoons of your best olive oil, black pepper grounded coarsely and fresh thyme. Don't even read further if the thyme is not fresh. Just don't . Forget it. Oh, you have fresh thyme? OK. You can go on. Now get some real garlic. Not that “made in China” shit that composed 90% of what in your supermarket (I'm not shitting you, 90% of the garlic you find in your store are now made in China. Half of it grown with human waste. You can send a nice thank you letter to the FDA if you wish). OK, now you have the right fucking garlic. Cut it nicely like uncle Pauli, meaning super thin. Cut 4 buds. Toss it in the bowl with everything I said earlier. Watch your fucking hands like you are going to operate someone. Done? OK. Now mix the whole thing in the bowl with your hand. 

Now set the oven like it is hell inside, 450 F, no less. Put the content of the bowl in a cast Iron pot with no enamel, like cowboy style. Put it in the oven. Cook 35 minutes. The house should smell like an Italian girl comes in your house and suddenly want to have sex.

You should stay on this so don't do anything else until those bones are done.

OK, now. Peel 4 large carrots, some gorgeous stuffs. Not the stuff you buy with food stamps. Two nice leeks. Yeah, the cashier will ask you what the hell this is, guaranteed, and you'll tell her, “you know, there is more than chicken and beef out there!”... anyway... cut the leeks along the length and clean it thoroughly (sand love to stick on those). Two branches of celery only. Two large white onions, the kind to make a grown man cry. Cut them only in half. Half a cup of tomato paste. (the ingredients should read: “Tomatoes”, and nothing else, no salt, no sugar, nothing else. Those are out there, I get them all the time even in the shittiest store; just learn how to read. Usually they have Italian name. Just don't do Heinz). Six whole pepper seeds, two cloves. A huge bunch of curly parsley, half a lemon with its skin, half a pound of Crimini/ Italian brown mushrooms. Fresh fucking thyme, a lot. Put all this in two gallons of water in a very large pot. Toss the bone inside with a good piece of smoke pork belly or a nice piece of bacon (but not too big as to overpower the veal. Remember, it's a veal stock, not a pork stock, ok?). Mix a bit. Boil for a hour. Simmer for four hours. Kill the fire. Keep the liquid. Throw everything else. Yes. Do it. Those vegetables and meats have given to the liquids everything they had, their taste, their soul, everything; even if they still look good, they are pointless to eat. Now your veal stock is ready. You can save it for two weeks. Beef stock can be saved a mere four days. Fish stock only two days. Chicken stock three days top. I know this well: these are the regulations that if you break them causes the state inspectors to close your joint!

All right. Now you have your stock that took you a whole fucking Saturday to do, and you are ready to have that Italian chick on Sunday for a great Bolognese and even better sex.

Start with one nice big onion cut in small cubes in grape seed oil. Not olive oil. Grape seed oil is also an Italian  (and French) thing. It has not cholesterol, no polyunsaturated fats, and has no taste. So all the ingredients you cook stays genuine in flavor. It's a bit pricey but it kept on going until 400F before burning. In other words, that oil is from the Gods, and the US corporate food hates it and never uses it. So it must be good.. Meanwhile, crush four canned anchovies in a small bowl. I know you American won't like it, but I promise you: you will never feel nor taste it, it's just like a natural MSG that, if you don't tell anyone, no one will notice, but it does make a hell of a difference in the deepness of the overall taste. Now saute the onion in a large, I mean large a pan, 12 inch minimum. The largest the pan is, the more the water can evaporate and the brown crisp can develop beautifully everywhere.

Half way until brown put the anchovies with the onion and mix... yes...i know...  it will smell horrendous in the first minute.. like some bad smelly socks.. full of ammonia.. ... yes... I know.... but then things starts to transform and the smell becomes amazing... well, maybe you'll find out after a dozen try, anyway. Now, put your grounded beef, grounded veal and grounded pork, equal parts. For 4 persons? Try half a pound of each. If you can't find ground veal, do half beef half pork. That's all right. You will just miss on something extraordinary, but you can keep on reading. Anyway, now the fishy smell should be gone. Toss in it one full garlic clove minced. Mix well on full fire. Add one full tablespoon of salt, same with black pepper.

When all the meat seems cooked and the proteins starts developing into an inconvenient crust at the bottom it is time for the wine to come singing. Red. Dry! One full cup to start. OK... I forgot something... Have this cup of wine hot on the side. You don't want to stop the cooking process by pouring cold wine on the meat! So heat up the wine just 4~5 minutes before doing this. Now pour the how wine on the meat and toss a pinch of coriander in it. The latter kills the taste of alcohol and leaves the warm taste of the wine intact. Whatever... just, put a pinch of the darn thing. Deglaize. Now the wine is almost absorbed, add a full cup of veal stock. Cover. Cook for 30 minutes. 

Open it up. Now it is smelling like fucking heaven and the Italian girl is really all over you. Hold her up by pouring more wine in her glass and come back to the stove. Put your dick on your hear, you'll smoke it later. Now, open a big can of magnificent crush tomatoes and toss it in the sauce. You don't need to add more tomato paste (hey, the sauce does not need to be this fucking “red” like corporate food wants you to believe. Taste it, you'll understand) Mix well. Add a nice bunch of big basil leaves in it. If you want to add great quality mushrooms, or some oil infused with it, here's the time. Cover again. Add a cube of unsalted butter. Don't ask why. Cook 20 minutes more on low fire.

Kill the whole thing. Keep it covered. Cooked your spaghetti the heck you want it to be done. Toss with the sauce in a way the pasta does not swim in it, with fresh grated dry Italian cheese on top. Cut some parley thin and reserve for the final touch on the plate on top of the cheese. Serve with a burgundy or a top notch Californian Pinot noir, and Crispy Italian bread. Have the girl feeding you.

My wife doesn't like to cook, and I find it very relaxing. Just wondering how typical this arrangement is . . . :)

A few updates based on some of the comments I've seen made on this thread: 

1. Quite a few male cooks have a rather conveneint arrangement: they cook delicious food, and their significant other cleans up the mess. I would like them to explain to me how they managed to score such a deal. 

2. Apparently, men who cook are hot. As an example of the typical comment, martymar18 emphasized, ""I find a guy who can cook and wants to cook with me to be super sexy."" I'm thinking this might be the substance of a good pick-up line. Like, ""Heh, baby, I'll make you something in my kitchen if you let me buy you a drink."" Or something.

3. It's common for men to cook and women to bake. I'll just go out and say it: I find baking to be more challenging than cooking other dishes. It's difficult because you can't adjust the flavors in the middle of the process. Baking tends to be more of an art. My buttermilk biscuits never turn out exactly the same. 

4. Many people have dads that also were the head chefs. The most cooking my dad accomplished was tasting my mom's spaghetti sauce on white bread.

I thought I would share",big_cil,516,57,194,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/fvw20/so_my_brother_asked_me_what_are_the_kitchen/,"Disclaimer:  I am not a chef, I cook.  I grew up pretty much Italian (thanks dad, you couldn't marry an Italian?) and around food all my life.  Once I moved out I read up on the internetz, watched way too much FoodNetwork and invested in some cook books and good kitchen utensils.  I have taken most ideas from bits and pieces of various cook books, Alton Brown (no uni-taskers) and personal preference.  I wrote this as if it were for a new graduate just moving out on their own into a smaller apartment.  The idea was to get you started with something inexpensive yet allowed you to make tasty yet inexpensive food.

Here goes


Part 1

**Hardware – Marshall’s, TJ Maxx or AJ Wright (all discount places where you can occasionally find the good stuff on sale)**

*Chef’s Knife* – You must get one of these.  If you are on a budget go for a cheaper version, but find someplace to sharpen it.  They will still last a long while

*Large Cutting Board* – Preferably dishwasher safe (if you have a dishwasher) so you can cut raw meats and not worry.  And yes, no glass, it will fuck up your knives.

*One good size stockpot* – For chili, stew and sauce.  A cheap one will suffice but not evenly distribute heat.  Heavier thicker ones are best

*One medium to large skillet* – This can be cast iron if you are open to that (I am a huge fan of them).  The one I got was like $25 and you can do anything on there

*One medium pot* – Forever Alone?  You don’t need to boil a lot of water, so use a small one for noodles, rice, etc

*Pepper Mill* – You don’t need to go high class, just get one that works.  Nothing better than freshly ground pepper on anything

*Cheese Grater* – Most likely the box grater that has 4 options.  Remember, buying shredded cheese is more expensive.  The grater will pay for itself in no time

*Meat Thermometer* – A cheap investment that will make even the best cooks better.  Great for rookies who need some help

*Mini Food Processor* – I’m not going to say this is optional, because it is a great investment.  These things are $20 bucks and you can treat em like shit but they still work.  Feeling saucy, buy a stick blender with the attachments (whisk and mini food pro) for around $50.

*Handheld Mandoline* – Optional, but a super quick and cheap ($20-$30 for a good one) way to evenly slice through veggies for (homefries, gratins, etc)


Part 2


**Dried Goods – For the pantry**

*Olive Oil* – This is what you should use 95% of the time for the fat.  Why?  Because it is one of the “healthier fats” and you want to look good in case you ever do have a conversation with a person of the opposite sex, right?  No need for Extra Virgin since your primary use is for cooking and cooking destroys the flavor of EVOO (insert snarky Rachel Ray joke here), so just get an olive oil, any will do, but bite the bullet and get the big ass tin which could range from $20-$30. The small little bottles actually cost you more than twice per ounce than if you buy the big one.  Costco helps

*Pasta* – Spaghetti type and a tube type should be enough.  While at grocery store don’t ever ask yourself if you need pasta, you always need pasta (if you are Italian, like me)

*Dried Herbs* – They keep for up to six months and are great for potent flavors and are to be added at the beginning of making your dish (i.e. oil simmering with garlic and onions, add your dried spice)

*Rice* – No brainer, cheap, easy and will go a long way

*Canned Tomatoes* – Always keep one of each (crushed/diced, sauce and paste) and again always buy this at the store.  Remember the Italian comment?  These are crucial to making your own sauce.  Why buy a jar of shit (Prego, et. Al) when you can make your own with your garlic, oil and dried herbs plus one 16 oz can of diced or crushed tomatoes, one 16 oz can of tomato sauce and the small can of tomato pastes?  That should cost you maybe $3 bucks total and will last just as long and taste a helluva lot better than the jar.  Tomatoes are very versatile.  Use em to finish off a pan sauce once you have deglazed the pan (see tips and tricks below), they work well in soups, stews and chilis obviously

*Kosher Salt* – Only way to go

*Whole Peppercorns* – see Kosher Salt

*Stocks or Broth* – Again, assuming you are on a budget buy the big can.  Use what you need and freeze the remaining in smaller bags and label.  That way they are there for easy use next time

*Corn Starch* – You want to thicken something?  Put corn starch in a small bowl with a liquid of your choice (milk or cream if making mac n cheese, broth if making a stew, etc) whisk that shit up and pour it in your heated vessel and crank the heat on high and stir.  It should tighten up in a minute

*Canned Beans* – Back when I was a bachelor a can of black beans and some hot sauce was a meal.  Shop the sales, you can find 5/$5 on occasion and always shoot for less than a dollar a can.  These never go back and work way better than the dried ones

*Wine* – Red or White, and make it good enough to drink (Forever Alone?) but not expensive where you regret using it for cooking.  There are tons of websites that give you cheap but good bottles of wine to drink.  Always keep one handy.  And yes I still work under the impression of white wine goes with fish and poultry, while red wine goes with pork, lamb and beef.

*Balsamic/Red Wine/Sherry/Champagne Vinegar* – A little goes a long way in flavor town (heyo Guy Fieri, I am all about the FoodNetwork douches today) but they are a tad pricey.  I cook almost every night and a bottle will last me almost 3 months.

*Dried Mushrooms* – These are expensive at Hippie (Whole) Foods, but again Costco to the rescue with a huge fucking tub for 10 bucks.  I’ve had mine going on 4 months now.  All you need to do to bring em back to life is give em a bath in hot water plus a stock or vinegar for added taste

*Hot Sauce* – I am not African American, but I will put that shit on about anything.  Any of the following will suffice; Franks, Tobasco (my least favorite actually), Cholula or the great Sriracha

*Baking Soda* – I am not much of a baker, so there is no need for baking powder on this list.  Buy two boxes of soda to get you started.  One to put in your fridge since it will get quite stanky after you forget about those peppers in the back corner for 4 months and the other I use primarily in my red sauce.  Why, you ask?  To eliminate some of the acidity.  Some people use sugar but I like my sauce to taste like tomatoes, herbs and other glorious meats I throw in there, not like Pizza Hut’s shitty excuse for a sauce.

Part 3

**Everyday Perishable Goods**

*Garlic* – One, because you don’t want any of those Twilight tools running around (The Lost Boys are way better) and two because I put garlic in everything.  Nothing better than garlic dancing in a pan of olive oil (I am going to patent that scent and make a candle out of it).  Oh and see my note about pasta?  You always need garlic.

*Shallots/Onions* – Any type will work, whatever your preference.  Once I cut into one it goes into my fridge in a Ziploc and will last about a week or so

*Fresh Herbs* – These are tricky since they don’t have a very long shelf life, maybe 5 days max.  My favorites are basil, rosemary, thyme and tarragon.  Refrigeration works, but I think it takes away some of the flavor.  Leave em out on the counter long enough and you just made yourself some dried herbs

*Parm/Romano* – I am a bigger fan of the latter, but do not, and I repeat do not buy the “pre-grated” stuff.  It loses flavor much quicker and again, costs more.  By a wedge and when you get home take it out of the plastic, because the cheese is still alive and wrap it in wax or parchment paper and tape shut.  Grate only what you need when you need it

*Potatoes* – Again if Forever Alone you don’t want to buy a 10 lb bag since they will go rotten before you use them.  Shoot for a 5 or 3 lb bag if they have it.  I know red skins come in the 3lb bag.  Potatoes are cheap, at my Mexican grocery store the 5 lb bag is like 2 bucks.  You will come up with thousands of ways to use them

*Frozen Veggies* – Don’t buy the shit that you can steam in the bag (giggle) or the stir fry mix.  Those are shitty veggies that they add stuff to and mark it up.  Buy the peas, corn, carrots or mixed bag that says they are flash frozen.  They last forever and there is zero prep work with them, just toss em out onto the pan

*Butter* – Lasts forever in the freezer, or even sitting in my cupboard

*Capers* – Here is me being an Eye-tai again, but these little bastards will liven up a sauce or a spread in a heartbeat

*Anchovies* – See above

*Lemons/Limes* – Extremely useful.  Since I go to the Mexican grocer these little bitches are always on sale.  They will last a few weeks and you can use em in more ways than one.  Remember that cheese grater I told you to get?  Use the smallest hole size and grate the zest off.  Once you have done that, then juice it.  Acid is always good with any fish dish.",,False,,t5_2qh7f,True,,,True,t3_fvw20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/fvw20/so_my_brother_asked_me_what_are_the_kitchen/,

First we made the meatballs (the person mashing them is my son):


http://imgur.com/a/4yyIZ


They were made with a mix of beef, veal, Italian sausage, sauteed onions and garlic, salt&amp;pepper, eggs, and panko 


We put meatballs on a pan as we formed them, then browned them in a pan, and then put them in our homemade sauce:


http://imgur.com/a/AvTVW


I have listed the sauce recipe before, but basically we start by cooking onions in olive oil until translucent, then adding garlic, then tomato paste, mix that around until all together, then we add dried basil, dried oregano, bay leafs, mix again, then we take whole sans marazano tomatoes, puree them, and add in them in the pot with the tomato paste. Mix around well. We then let it cook for at least an hour to marry the flavors and add salt/pepper/italian seasoning to taste as it goes. 


We then took baguettes (we didn't make the bread), cut them in half, put sauce down on one side, then meatballs, then fresh mozzarella (we didn't make the cheese). We then popped them into the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese. After that we put sauce on the other side of the sandwich and were done:


http://imgur.com/a/jyZEI


They actually came out quite well. We make the sauce all the time, but rarely make meatballs.  We are planning on making a bunch of meatballs and freezing them so we can quickly make these subs whenever we want. We already keep a bunch of the sauce on hand.

His normal fillings were either potato and cheese or sauerkraut.  This year we decided to branch out and experiment with some new fillings.  The first experiment was simply just adding bacon to our normal potato and cheese.  The second was a ricotta and spinach filling.  
  
[This album](http://imgur.com/a/BS0XR) is simply a collection of photos we took during the whole process which spanned from Friday night to Saturday night.

I can't really recommend the best method, but I will say that cooking it to the right temperature is very important. [A thermometer like this](http://www.amazon.com/CDN-Digital-Programmable-Probe-Thermometer/dp/B00046YFHE/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352391732&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=digital+probe+thermometer) will set off an alarm when it reaches a certain temperature. This is much better than poking it over and over again, or opening the oven or grill lid to see if the pop-up timer has popped. I have that particular timer I linked to, but maybe someone can recommend an even better one. 

Beyond that, I don't know. What method of cooking is best? Grill, fry, roast, or other? What's the best way to season it? How should it be stuffed? What about brining it? 

Edit: If you post a link, please give us a description of what it is.

1372134840.0,379,self.Cooking,1h0opw,Why do many places leave the tail on shrimp when it's mixed with other food when served??,zoethezoologist,516,137,347,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1h0opw/why_do_many_places_leave_the_tail_on_shrimp_when/,"Am I just an idiot for not knowing the answer to this??  People don't actually eat the tails do they?

Whether I go to a hole-in-the-wall or a renowned fine dining restaurant, if I order something with shrimp, the tails are always left on.  I think it's fine if you get grilled shrimp on a skewer or something like that, but when it's mixed in with my pasta and sauce or in polenta, or anything ""messy"" I just do not understand it.  I always just remove the tails when I cook them at home so it's easier and cleaner to eat when I'm done.  Plus, when I'm out at a nice restaurant, I feel like an idiot when I'm trying to pry the damn tails off and not make a mess on my table...

Please enlighten me, I have been too embarrassed to ask someone at a restaurant for the reason behind this in case I missed out on some important piece of shrimp knowledge in my upbringing.

*edit* thanks for all of the responses. At least I'm not the only one who questioned this like I thought!! I still think its a pain in the ass to take the tails off when they're covered in sauce, but I get it.

Ingredients:

* olive oil 
* italian dressing 
* lettuce
* tomato
* olives (i prefer black)
* jalapenos
* onion
* oregano and any other spices you want
* parmesan
* mustard
* hard salami
* turkey
* ham
* pastrami
* meunster
* provolone
* cheddar
* mozzarella

Note: use whatever meats and cheeses you like, I switch it up but the ones I listed are my favorites. Though he did say not to use Swiss because it is strong and can overpower the other flavors.  Also said hard salami is a must-have.

Prepare the sandwich:

* Take a loaf of bread (I prefer italian, and sometimes sweet italian round) and slice it horizontally.
* dig out a good portion of the bread from inside the top half forming a canoe, and maybe a little from the bottom half.
* make a mixture of olive oil and salad dressing with a 1 to 1 ratio.  spread this mixture over the top half of the bread until the top is coated
* layer the meats and cheeses alternating.  I go with hard salami -&gt; meunster -&gt; turkey -&gt; provolone -&gt; ham -&gt; chedder -&gt; pastrami -&gt; mozzarella
* (optional, I do not do this) throw the sandwich in the oven if you want
* add vegetables
* top with mustard, oregano and parmesan

Last week you guys came up with some great ideas for wedding gifts. Thanks! Heres what I want to contribute today.

Dr. pepper pulled pork in a crock pot.

&gt;1 can of dr. pepper

&gt;pork(any kind, its going in a slow cooker, its going to taste really good regardless)

Thats it 4 hours on high, all day on low(before work kinda deal). 

Dont bother browning or adding spices, that just takes up time. Its going to taste great either way. Ive added the spices/browned, it takes 30+min. This is easier, faster, and tastes almost the same. People always compliment my fiance on this dish.

So break it up, it took only a few seconds of poking it and stiring. I like to put it on a bun and add Sweet Baby Rays.

So this is my 0 effort dish, anyone else have any?

Ingredients:
PANCAKES:
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1 Tablespoon canola oil
1 large egg, lightly beaten

CINNAMON FILLING:
1/2 cup butter, melted
3/4 cup brown sugar, packed
1 Tablespoon ground cinnamon

CREAM CHEESE GLAZE:
4 Tablespoons butter
2 ounces cream cheese
3/4 cup powdered sugar
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
1. Prepare pancake batter: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt. Whisk in milk, oil and egg, just until batter is moistened (a few small lumps are fine).

2. In a medium bowl, mix butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. Scoop the filling into a small zip baggie and set aside. You don’t want this to remain super-liquidy. It’s best if it becomes a consistency similar to toothpaste.

3. In a medium, microwave-safe bowl- heat butter and cream cheese until melted. Whisk together until smooth; whisk in powdered sugar and vanilla extract; set aside.

4. Heat large skillet over medium-low heat. Spray with nonstick spray. Scoop about 3/4 cup batter onto the skillet. Snip the corner of your baggie of filling and squeeze a spiral of the filling onto the top of the pancake. When bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet or platter and keep in a warm oven until ready to serve.

5. When ready to serve, spoon warmed glaze onto the top of each pancake.

Tips:
*Keep the heat low or your pancakes might cook up too quickly. Don’t flip them until you see those bubbles starting to pop on top. Flip them with a wide spatula so you can grasp the whole thing without batter and filling dripping all over the place!
*It’s best if you pour the batter onto your skillet, wait a minute or so and then swirl the cinnamon onto the batter. That’ll give it a chance to set a little before you add the swirl.
*If your baggie of filling begins to get too thick, just pop it in the microwave for a few seconds to soften it up again. On that same note, it shouldn’t be too runny. The consistency of soft toothpaste is perfect. If it’s melty and runny, it will tend to run all over your pancakes. Once you micro it, let it sit on the counter at room temp for a while until it thickens slightly.

Anything with 5 stars on this site will be outstanding and they have almost every conceivable recipe accessible by a simple search.  I find the celebrity chef recipes are genuinely wonderful.  If it says ""Emeril"" on it it will be one of the best recipes you've ever made.  I promise.  Flay recipes are good too, as are some of the other celebrity chefs.  I will blindly make an Emeril or Flay recipe, the other chefs I count the upvotes.
3. foodwishes.blogspot.com  Sometimes it's just really hard to wrap your head around a cooking technique you've never seen.  For example, learning to sautee is actually really hard if you've never seen anyone do it and your mom/grandma never imparted their knowledge to you.  Well, Foodwishes is the solution.  Chef John never puts himself on camera, it's all about the food.  You'll have a tonne of ""gee whiz"" moments when you see a technique on camera that sounded impossible in a book made simple with just a video.

I hope these links help someone, they've really helped me as I've tried to learn.  Have fun cooking!",,False,,t5_2qh7f,False,,,True,t3_mups3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/mups3/3_great_websites_for_aspiring_cooks/,

These are called Umbrella Ink-Caps in Danish and turn black underneath the gills when they flower (at which point they will turn anything you use them in pitch black, thus the name). They're never seen in stores, as they deteiorate at a rapid pace- 24 hours in refrigerator and they're already mosre mush than 'shroom. I use them whenever she brings them home for flavouring and, when she comes with a big harvest like last night, I turn them into a mushroom stock.

I really enjoy using them, as I've always believed, like most Danes, that these are just yet another mushroom that's good for kicking and that's about it, but  in reality it is one of the most flavourful mushrooms I have ever cooked with- and so unique in our local fauna, that it's impossible to mistake for anything else.

But anyways, the big question here is, what do YOU sometimes have access to that is nearly impossible to find in stores? Is there anything YOU think more people should be aware of is not just a plant or animal, but something incredibly tasty and good when used right?",,False,,t5_2qh7f,False,,,True,t3_11mwhk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/11mwhk/my_girlfriend_walked_through_the_woods/,

My target demographic would be broke, young(ish), smart, and snarky dudes/ladies who want to know how to cook sexy, healthy, fuckin' delicious foodstuffs on a tight budget. I'm hesitant because I'm aware the intertubes are pretty much clogged with this sort of thing, but here's why I think it might work:

*
I'm classically trained in French cuisine. I graduated from culinary school and have a big silly hat as a trophy.

*
I've got a couple of years in the industry, and I'm covered in scars to prove it.

*
I've been broke plenty of times, but learned how to make it work in a big, delicious way.

*
I'm sassy as all get-out. I think I'd be a great host.

*
[I'm kinda cute](http://imgur.com/r74uv), which probably wouldn't hurt.

It's still kind of a vague, gauzy dream of mine. I've got some episodes in mind, e.g. cook your way into someone's pants, basic sauces, Batman themed food, etc. Any feedback would be welcomed. 

Thaaaaaaaaanks.

1310578577.0,243,self.Cooking,iom51,14 tips for making pizza dough,higherlogic,315,72,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/iom51/14_tips_for_making_pizza_dough/,"This is adapted from Peter Reinhart's *American Pie* book:

1. Unbleached flour is always preferred over bleached because it still has beta-carotene, which gives the dough better flavor and aroma.

2. If you use an electric mixer, always use the dough hook and mix on low speed (for a very wet dough, you can start with the paddle attachment to gather the ingredients in a ball and then switch to a hook).

3. The trick for mixing with a food processor is to use only the pulse switch in the beginning and mix only until the ingredients are hydrated and form a ball. Then let the dough rest for 5-20 minutes before mixing again. The resting stops the processor from tearing the dough into strands. When you resume mixing, mix for an additional 45-60 seconds. The short rest period followed by the short final mixing cycle is all you need to make the dough.

4. You reduce oxidation in your dough by letting it rest after it first comes together in the bowl. The rest period also allows the dough to hydrate fully.

5. Sticky dough will not stick to wet hands or tools. If you're mixing by hand, repeatedly dip one of your hands into room-temperature (or cold if specified) and use it much like a dough hook, working the dough vigorously into a smooth mass as you rotate the bowl with your other hand. This usually takes about 6 minutes for the dough to firm up and gluten to develop.

6. If you measured your flour by cups rather than weight, it's more likely that you'll have to adjust the water and flour. If the dough does not feel the way described (e.g. too tight, slack, or sticky), don't be afraid to make the appropriate adjustments. In the end, the dough always dictates how much water or flour to use, not the exact measurements in the recipe.

7. Use the windowpane test to determine when your dough is sufficiently mixed. This is done by snipping a piece off and gently tugging and turning, stretching it out until it forms a paper-thin, translucent membrane somewhere near the center (it's kind of like making a really small pizza). If the dough does not form a membrane, or windowpane, it needs another 1-2 minutes of mixing. Remember to rotate when tugging, because even properly developed dough will rip if you stretch in only one direction. The windowpane means the gluten protein has properly bonded in the dough.

8. Wetter dough is more difficult to handle, but usually produces a superior crust, with a better, puffier edge.

9. Oil or fat is added to American-style pizza, which uses high-protein flour (bread flour) that needs to be tenderized. It's usually not needed in doughs made with all-purpose flour, such as the Napoletana dough.

10. Less yeast and longer fermentation are preferable to more yeast and fast fermentation. Artisanal bakers are taught to use only the minimum amount of yeast to leaven the dough. More yeast speeds up fermentation, but the yeast consumes all the available sugar in the dough, converting it into alcohol, thus reducing the flavor.

11. If using active dry yeast instead of instant yeast, increase the amount by 25 percent (for 1 teaspoon of instant yeast, use 1 1/4 teaspoon of active dry yeast). Active dry yeast must be dissolved in a few tablespoons of water.

12. Overnight fermentation almost always improves your dough, although you can mix it early in the morning if you'll be using it in the evening.

13. Many pizza dough recipes are interchangeable. Napoletana and other soft, sticky doughs are best for smaller, individual-sized pizzas, as they are difficult to stretch into larger pizzas. If you want to make a family-sized pizza, use the stronger neo-Neapolitan, New York, or Americana variations.

14. The best crust is one that enhances the pizza without drawing too much attention to itself. When the crust does receive attention, it's frequently negative (too soft or too dry). A perfect crust is recognized only afterward when you recall the snap, the natural sweetness, and the creamy melt-in-your-mouth quality of each bite.",,False,,t5_2qh7f,False,,,True,t3_iom51,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/iom51/14_tips_for_making_pizza_dough/,

It was suggested by entropikone that I put them into a new thread. Well, I think this is a good idea.

This gives me somewhere to store all the recipes I keep in my head and gives everyone else access to them. They aren't much use to others when they're locked up in my head now are they?

So I'm going to spend a few hours today copying and pasting my recipes from various threads over the last 8 months, and adding some other ones that I regularly cook. There will be some repetition for some people so my apologies for that.

A lot of my recipes are based on different cuisines from around the world. I don't claim them to be authentic, just *my* interpretation.

Amounts and quantities are estimates, I tend to eyeball my measurements and season by taste, so use caution and your own judgement.

I hope people enjoy this thread. It'll take me a while to get every recipe posted so please be patient.

Warm regards,

Put your rice in the pot, fill with water or stock until the water amount is the depth of your thumbnail (about 1/2 - 5/8 of an inch for those of you with oddly proportioned hands) from the top of the rice. The thing about this is that it is infinitely scaleable, meaning that if you're making rice for one or rice for 100, in any size of pot, the amount of water above the rice is the same. I do find that basmati benefits from a bit less water though.

This Sunday, I will be cooking a turkey for an early Thanksgiving dinner for some of my friends. I'm expecting somewhere between 10 - 15 people to show up and I have no idea what I'm doing. I have absolutely no cooking experience but I am pretty good at following instructions and this is something I look forward to learning. I've looked at some recipes and they differ in some subtle ways but as I understand it, the goal is to slow cook (not overcook) the turkey so that it remains juicy. It seems simple, but I know that people frequently mess this up, so I'm wondering if you guys have any suggestions that might help me out. Any feedback will be appreciated and I might post some updates and pictures of my struggle on Sunday. Thanks in advance :)

Edit: Was not expecting nearly this much feedback. I'm glad I came to /r/Cooking because you guys know your shit. There is a lot of great information here but here is a list of a few of the things I've learned. 

1. Thaw the damn bird
2. Look into Alton's method(a lot of people seem to have had success with it)
3. Prepare stuffing separately
4. Have a game plan and don't panic
5. Use a probe thermometer
6. ""Brine that shit!""
7. Do not brine a prebrined turkey
8. Drunk guests are happy guests
9. If you can't handle the heat, get out the kitchen

I let it reduce for a while but I got hangry so I put the chicken breasts back into it for a little instead of waiting for it to be the right saucy consistency.  And then I ate it!

We've got a couple of pretty good dill/salt/vinegar type pickles (but we're always open to new suggestions), but our attempts at sweet pickles have all ended with the pickle spears or slices looking wilted and dehydrated and the texture is a bit rubbery. I assume this is because of the very high sugar content of the sweet pickle recipes.

Is there a way to keep them crisp in a high sugar recipe?
