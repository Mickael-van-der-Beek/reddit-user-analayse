The communication block was so heavy that nothing he suggested could make them open up and talk.


Finally, the counsellor stands up, walks to the corner of the room and produces a bass guitar. He plugs it into an amp and begins to play fervently. Gradually the barriers break down and the couple begin to discuss their problems, and little things that always bothered them, that they never felt encouraged to bring up before.


At the end of the session, they were smiling and laughing just like old times. Before leaving, the couple asked the counsellor, ""What did you do? How did your playing that music help make everything work out?""


The counsellor replied,  ""Simple.  Everybody talks during the bass solo.""",,False,self,t5_2qpc3,False,,bottom-dweller,True,t3_lnd27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/lnd27/bass_joke/,

I started out playing guitar when I was 12, moving on to bass just after my 13th birthday. I fucking *loved* bass, the undertones, the feeling of the low notes on my Epi Thunderbird was just incredible. Then shit went sour. When I was just shy of 15 I had the first of what ended up as a series of 8 strokes voer the course of about 3 months, varying in intensity. I won't go into much detail but man did it fuck me up. After recovering from the total hemiparalysis, I realised I'd lost most fine motor control in my right arm (my plucking arm) so what little fingerstyle guitar and bass I knew was totally gone. My hands were also totally out of sync. My stamina, rhythm etc. that I'd built up over 2.5 years were just gone. I wanted to get better but I couldn't. Nothing seemed like it could make it better. I was wrong. I decided to start teaching guitar and bass to local kids (though nobody wanted to learn bass) and that really drove me to get better, learning new styles and techniques that I would never have otherwise looked at.

Now, as of tonight, I have finally reached the goal I set myself at 15; to learn the bass solo from Muse's 'Invincible' (and guitar parts in The All American Rejects' 'Straightjacket Feeling', but that's not relevant here). I can only play it with a pick (the only way I can play at any serious speed anymore - I have maybe 20 seconds of stamina when it comes to plucking) but hey, I'm back in sync and all is looking good, I even got myself a Cort acoustic bass recently as a pre-celebration! Just wanted to share with you guys. Will post a photo of my family tomorrow. ;)

***EDIT:*** There are too many people who have commented congratulating me (or things to that effect) so I can't individually thank you without becoming boring, so **take an upvote each! :D**.

They won't always be the hardest songs, they won't always be the easiest.  Ill be starting a suggestions thread later on, where I'll draw from your recommendations for a future song of the week.  I had planned to launch this on a grander scope, with all of this explained via video, but I'm splitting my hours currently at my grandmother's bedside in the hospital, and work.  I'll do what I can when the family is back on track to give a better presentation.

Certain songs will be impressive in scope, and more difficult.  Other songs will be just plain fun.  The kinds of songs that you can't help but jam along to an emphasize every note like its exuding from your soul.  The first week will be a simple song, with a LOT of character.

I believe that simply posting the most famous bass songs one after another would do a disservice to us.  This is about expanding your playing styles, your abilities, and DISCOVERING music.

With that, I give you song #1.  A choice of my own, and always a favorite when I play it for friends.  [&gt;&gt;Beck's ""Go It Alone.""&lt;&lt;](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PewCPd7U8Bc)

At this particular point in the band's life, Justin Meldal-Johnson had left the band to pursue his now-lucrative future with Nine Inch Nails (more from him to come, for sure.)  Picking up the bass on this particular song is none other than [&gt;&gt;Jack White&lt;&lt;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_White) himself of the Raconteurs, White Stripes, The Dead Weather etc.

I want to add a timely reminder to the community that we could be using this space for a lot better things than pictures of our squier basses, more pictures of victor wooten, and more pictures of cats.

There are useful things on the front page right now, but you have to go past all of the unskilful stuff to find it, past all of the filler material that gets all of the upvotes.

Full disclosure, I rarely post material to this sub, but I do upvote/downvote out of necessity, and glean a lot of great stuff from this sub.

Every once in a while, it doesn't hurt to have a local reminder that it could be a lot easier to make us better bassists, insead of better  gear photographers. all it takes is a little recalibration of why we are subscribed to the sub in the first place.

Anyway, carry on.

**[EDIT] Like so many people have already stated, it makes a lot of sense that self post mode would help to balance out the chunk with the monk, the laugh with the staff.

I don't know too much info on it, but this greatly saddens me.  When i first started playing bass, i re-watched the blues brothers, and the music was so much better than i remembered, after that i looked up who was playing with them, and of course it was Dunn.  listening to him play like that, made me want to play jazz at that level, with that much groove. still working on that.  But I have no words for how great of a loss this is, not only to the bass world, but to the music world.

1369060964.0,162,self.Bass,1ep22h,Is gigging etiquette becoming a lost art?,burkholderia,197,35,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/1ep22h/is_gigging_etiquette_becoming_a_lost_art/,"Maybe it's the crowds we've been playing with for our last few rounds of shows (a lot of butt-rock and pop punk bands) but I've been noticing a pretty steep drop off in gigging etiquette among a lot of bands lately. 

* Noodling. Why the noodling between songs? And why does is it always seem to be the bass player? I mean really, no one gives a crap that you can slap. Stop dicking around between songs. 

* Don't break down on stage. This one is especially directed at drummers, but applies to everyone. Grab your shit and get off stage. Need to wrap your cables and put things in bags/case? Fine, do it off stage where you aren't wasting the sound guy and other band's time in the process.

* Watching the other bands. Why does it seem that so many bands can't be bothered to stick around to listen to the other groups on the bill? I know I've been guilty of this from time to time, and some of my bandmates wander off during other group's performances more than I would like them to, but when a whole band is missing from the venue except for the time they're on stage it's pretty obvious to the rest of us. Doubly so when your crowd of friends leaves with you. 

* Loading in late/out early. I can understand this in some venues where space is tight and gear needs to be moved out to make room for other bands/fans/whatever. But loading all your gear out the door the second you're done and not coming back in to see the other groups? Straight up dick move. Ditto for showing up after the specified load in time and expecting to walk your drum set through a crowd. Be on time. 

* Gear sharing. I've played plenty of shows where for space or timing needs, stuff needed to be backlined.  More often than not I volunteer my bass cab because I know what it sounds like and I tend to be pretty rough on cabs with my effects use and don't want to blow up some guys cab. Consequently I've had someone blow a cab of mine that we used as backline. Shit happens. **What I don't understand is the mentality that someone has to provide you an amp. Or that when I say ""you can use my cab, bring a head"" that means you don't need to bring any gear except your bass.** My last backline experience not one of the other three bands brought a head even though they were told explicitly that there would only be a bass cab available. I even had a band ask me to use the power supply from my pedal board because they didn't think they needed to bring one. And trying to coordinate this stuff via email with bands is like herding cats. Don't want to share your stuff or use someone else's? Fine. Reply to the damn email.  

* On the subject of emails, what is it about bands who don't reply to anything? Can't do a gig? Fine, reply to the email. Need time to see if your members are on board to play a show? Cool, let us know. Don't be a flake. 

Sorry for the rant, but some of this stuff seems so simple to me and I can't figure out why people can't just be decent to one another.

So, I had two shows yesterday (morning and evening service). I show up in the morning, get set up, and when we start rehearsal, it was like everything just clicked, literally over night. It seems weird to say, but it felt like I could actually see the patterns, like I just knew what to do. I've never felt anything like it. I got a few looks from my band leader, I think he was as confused as I was! After the service, someone said to me ""your bass lines make me feel like smoking a cigar!""

He said he had this guy around for a while but wasn't playing it, so he was passing it on to me to give it a better home. I'm restringing it tonight and I'm going to treat it realll nice. 

Honestly, I like it more knowing he's passing his on to me, rather than sort of obviously going and buying one. It's really thoughtful that way, and has the added meaningful value.

One user, lizardtailgoescrazy, had been saving for a new bass for himself, and decided to use that money to bring the forlorn me back from the realm of the music-less. All the way from India, he ordered me a bass.

What I haven't seen is good advice on how to do it.  Most of the advice on here recommends tools, software, or websites, but doesn't say what to do with them.  A lot of the other advice is fragmented, and skips steps to focus on one aspect or another.  I pride myself in having a great ear.  A lot of that was natural talent, but it still took practice.  I'll try to start with the basics and work up from there.  I'll probably miss a few things, so feel free to contribute in the comments.

*****
The first thing you need to do when training your ear is be able to hold a pitch in your head.  Some people are born able to do this, other people have to try really hard.  When you're learning songs by ear, this is critical.  The best way to practice this is to put on whatever song you're trying to learn and pick a note.  Maybe it's the first note of the song, maybe it's that one note in the middle of a run you just can't figure out.  Once that note is played on the recording press the pause button.  Now hold that note in your head, go over to your bass, pick it up, and find the note that matches it.  It can be really hard at first.  You have to keep the original note in your head while listening to the note's you're playing to see if they match.  Feel free to put down the bass and listen again if you loose the original pitch.  If you're completely new to this, it may take you several tries.  If you want to learn a bass line to a song, do this for every note until you know what they all are.  Then go back and get the rhythm down.  It gets easier really quickly.  After a while, you'll be remembering strings of notes. 

One other step I really recommend at this point is to take note of what you're playing once you figure out the note.  Where is it on the fretboard?  What note is it?  By taking the extra step here, you'll also be learning a little basic theory and your neck.  It will save you hours in practice time down the road.

*****

Once you master that, the next step is to learn your intervals.  I think that this is stressed too much to be honest.  If you're playing enough, you'll most likely start to recognize them without thinking about it.  It is a good idea to beef it up a little bit though, so here's how you do it.  First clear your throat.  You're going to need to sing a little bit.  It will really help you get this faster.  One of the best things for this is actually [a song from the Sound of Music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RW3nDRmu6k).  The syllibals in this song will help you remember pitches.  This is called solfège.  Try singing the Do Re Mi...etc until you're reasonably comfortable with it.  Try playing the first note on your bass and singing it, then playing the octave to make sure you're still in tune when you get to the last Do syllable.  

Once you can do that, you're ready to work on intervals.  This time you have to keep two pitches in your head.  The first lower pitch and the second higher pitch.  Start with the first one, and sing up the syllables until you get to the second one.  If it's in the major scale, you'll eventually get there, and when you count the steps, you'll know what the interval is.  If you sang three syllables, it's a third, etc.  

There is another group of syllables for minor intervals as well.  You can expand into that, but in the beginning, try to just focus on major intervals.  If you you come across a minor interval, just figure out what steps it fits between, and you'll know where it falls.  If it's between 2 and 3 steps, that's most likely a minor 3rd.  (It could be an augmented 2nd, as well, but don't worry about that for now.  Let's keep things simple).

*****

The next step from here is figuring out how to do this with more than one note at the same time.  It's time for chords.  At this point, you need to hold three or four, or sometimes more notes in your head while you figure out what to play.  You may not be able to stop the recording and remember the entire chord for quite a while.  Fortunately most modern music uses repetitive progressions, so if that's the case, I recommend resting on the other chords of the song, and figuring out what to do when that chord comes up.

The other thing that's important here is that you need to know your scales.  By that, I mean you need to know all of them in every key.  Here you have to figure out all of the notes happening in the chord and then match them to the corresponding scale.  Start with the root, then look for the third and fifth.  Next start playing scales from the root and figure out what scales have the correct third and fifth (and sometimes seventh).  As you're doing this, it's also a good idea to focus on identifying the notes in the chord and learn their names.  Eventually, you should be able to identify and name a dominant 7th or Minor 9 chord by sound and name.  

*****

Lastly, you need to develop the most important part of your ear, and that's listening to what's going on around you while you play.  While the other steps are a bit of a progression, this can be worked on from day one.  The best exercise for this is to talk to someone else while you practice.  If you're still learning your major scales, talk to your girlfriend, or mom, or brother, or whoever else is around while you run them.  This is a lot harder than it sounds.  Don't let yourself slack in what you're playing either.  If you need to go back because you flubbed a note, do it.

Another great exercise is to play with your drummer and jam out on a simple progression.  Take turns following each other with different rhythms and volume levels.  At first, set a leader, after a while, just feel it out and let one person follow and the other lead without deciding who's going to do what before hand.   After you can do that with the drummer, get the rest of the band involved.  

Hopefully that helps.

TL;DR: Ear training takes a lot of work.

Week 2!,beagley,129,12,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/1gppca/lets_learn_it_rbass_week_2/,"Planned on getting this updated yesterday, but life's been rough - you might remember me mentioning the failing health of a family member in last week's post.  I lost my grandmother on Thursday morning, and have been dealing with that.

On to happier times - Let's talk about today's song!  Kyuss has always been near and dear to my heart, and those of us stoner rockers that remember the early 90s will recall that key members of this band would later form Queens of the Stone Age.

Scott Reeder, bassist for Kyuss, learned to play in the same method as jimi hendrix.  [He learned with a left handed bass, strung right handed, so he has learned to play with his strings reversed](http://scottreeder.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Scott-Warwick_03.jpg).  This has GREATLY affected his playing and writing style, which makes his basslines very unique.  

Scott spent some time as the Touring bassist for Tool between Paul D'amour and Justin Chancellor.  This was the cause of Tool's covering of the song Demon Cleaner.  He was featured in Metallica's Some Kind of Monster film, as he tried out for the band, eventually losing out to Robert Trujillo.  Most recently he played with the Sound City project on a song called 'From Can to Can't' featuring Dave Grohl, Corey Taylor, and Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick.

These days you'll find Reeder playing solo stuff and aiding with his endorser, Warwick, wherever possible.

Todays' song is Kyuss' Space Cadet.  Performed acoustic, it still rings true as a great little tune for learning various techniques and improving on.  I hope you have as much fun with it as I do.  

PLEASE this is about music discovery, and learning something.  I know I can't always post songs that will be new to everyone, and I can't always post songs that will teach everyone something.  If you find the song awful, or too easy, I'm sorry.  But please don't message me about my 'awful taste' like last time.

Aside from the growing number of gear pics (which I'm not necessarily opposed to) there is an exorbitant number of posts dwelling on the ""under-appreciated bassist"" cliche. There always seems to be a rage comic, meme style image macro, or general wallowing in self-induced misery over a bassist's supposed identity in music.

Personally, I'm a very minimalist bass player. I enjoy taking the back seat and getting lost in the hypnosis of a good rhythm. I see nothing intrinsically wrong with repetition. I would rather be in perfect communication with the drummer than worry about competing with the guitarist. AND THAT'S WHY I'M A BASSIST. I don't play bass because I think I need a required amount of attention, because that's just not my job when I play music. Everyone has different styles and approaches which is what is fantastic about this wonderful instrument. But I am asking my fellow bass players, can we cut this ""Oh woe is me, why can't people love me as much as the guitarist"" bullshit? Most of this sentiment is way over exaggerated anyways, and the only people who seem to keep it alive are bass players themselves. 

Have some damn pride in your instrument, and quit yo bitching. 

Edit: I just want to clarify my intention behind this post because I think some people are misunderstanding the second paragraph. I never meant to criticize any style of bass playing, I was simply mentioning my own style because I think it is relavent to why I chose to play bass in the first place. I simply wanted to bring attention to the culture of self-hate that a lot of bass players seem to portray to the world. There is no reason to perpetuate the under-appreciated bassist routine. Any music lover worth their salt knows that the bass is just another essential ingredient to the music.

One day, I walk outside, and I see a Fender case sitting next to the door. It looked too big to be one of my dad's guitars, so I opened it up and found my Spector Legend Classic.

First of all, I learned that Google Docs has some really handy analytics if you format your questions in anything besides just text forms. So we might have a version 2 down the line with more interesting questions reformatted to take advantage of those tools. 

A lot of you rightly pointed out I blew a lot of the formatting, which is on me. I’ve done my best to make up for those errors, but we got SO MANY responses (over 1000!) that the fixed version of the survey should still yield some generally accurate data. For the next version, I’d definitely like the help of someone experienced with surveying and or statistics.

I'm going to run *ONE MORE* survey this week to settle some of the issues that came up about the suggestions for the subreddit, which you'll see shortly. The link to that will be up soon.

**Data**


* We are 88% between 11 and 30 years old. This closely mirrors Reddit’s general findings.

* We are 98% dudes.

* 61% of us have been playing between 1 and 7 years. 9% of us have been playing for more than 16. 

* 43% of us play one or two instruments, 5% claim to be a symphony, and 24% of us play enough to be a band on their own. 16% just play bass.

* The info about the favorite/most used/essential gear stuff will be up later.

* 78% of us play fingerstyle, 18% are pickers, 4% mainly play slap.

* 38% of us have rigs around $1k to $5k, 26% are under $500, and 31% of us have under a grand of gear. 5% have $5k to $10k in gear. This is some useful information, because we see that it takes between $500 and $1000 to get a standard rig up and running. 

* You are all very modest about how good you are. Perfect bell curve, with 48% at a 3, but 33% at a 4, and only 13% at a 2.

* 43% of you are non-professionals, and just 4% make all of their money from bass playing. 29% have gigs from time to time. 

* Rock is the most heavily represented genre at 33%, Metal at 13%, Funk and Jazz sharing 11%. Blues, Punk, and Other follow.

* A lot of you are using Chrome, which makes me happy. None of you are using anything less than IE 9, which makes me REALLY happy.

**Subreddit Ideas**

* A lot of you were very kind about suggestions for the subreddit, and many of you were very critical, and a handful of you were just rude. Thank you to everyone for taking the time to respond. 

* There’s a pretty even division between people who like and dislike the new self-post, gear thread format. We'll settle this in the survey.

* People asking for more information for new players, and people asking for less about new players. We'll settle this in the survey too.

* People saying more gear and people saying less gear. See above.

* Lots of people asking for the bass neck back in the banner! I’ll work on that soon.

* Call for weekly competitions and challenges. I'd welcome ideas!

* Professional and/or very advanced players giving tutorials or lessons or AMAs. If you're willing, please message me and we'll set that up. 

* Meetups?

* “More Emphasis on sharing user playing techniques. Less emphasis on showing pictures of our gear.”

* Style revisions. I’ll work on that soon. Some of you like it, some of you don't. 

* More user contribution like videos, compositions.

* Experience flair like Ask Historians. Pros get a pro tag, etc.

* Better sidebar (this is in the works).

* More flairs. /u/CustardFilled has been making these for us (THANK YOU), I'll be forwarding them a list of stuff y'all suggested, but please still suggest flair in the flair request thread (just search for it).

* TABs, transcriptions.

* Someone volunteered to help with the FAQ. The FAQ is open to editing. Anyone subscribed here that has posted for a while can edit. PLEASE feel free to work on it. 

* Some people talked about the mods watching more closely for bad advice and bad posts. Please report these and message the mods when you see stuff like that. 

I'm happy to see so much interest in making this a useful resource, but we gotta organize. I'll be making a survey for those issues tonight and edit here. Please keep sending me suggestions and ideas for the sub! ",Mod Post,False,self,t5_2qpc3,1373851877.0,mod,,True,t3_1iav7l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/1iav7l/survey_results/,moderator

I've been playing for close to 10 years. Done everything from jazz in school to auditioning and getting accepted to Berklee. But I never felt like ""I got it"" as far as solo'd bass is concerned. Put me with a good drummer and we get people dropping to the floor but as soon as I'm by myself nobody seems to care.

That would all change after I met a man my age by the name of Craig Waters. Normally I don't take too much from people. A lot of times I'll be the most musical in the room as far as knowledge goes. But this guy has seen it all. Played with some names. Some Grammy names (James browns bassist anyone?). First time I felt like a child playing with somebody but he keeps booking me. He gives great advice and is very adamant about styles and rhythms (plays guitar like a bassist would... on time lol) So now my weaknesses are apparent. And I'm going home every night and sharpening that stick. But there is always something I could be doing better. And I'm stressed. And I don't know why he wants to keep playing with a hack bassist. But I keep pushing anyways.

I enter guitar center yesterday. I need a new amp. Really loving the markbass 102 combo. I'm sittin there tweaking and trying out different techniques to see how it sounds. I start diggin in on some groove I've been working on for one of Craig's songs and I hear somebody behind me. I look up and there is a crowd of 6-8 people closin their eyes and bobbin their heads. Totally blown away by it all. Here I am just tweaking not givin a shit using the ear I've been developing with Craig and now I got 7 people groovin at a shop JUST ME. WUT. Inwardly I felt awkward and didn't know what to say but turns out I didn't have to talk too much. They took care of that. They asked for business cards and i made a few contacts. After I sat down in my car man I couldn't stop grinning like a silly bastard.

TL;DR Went to guitar center to buy an amp; had a small group of people bobbing their heads and applauding me after I finished.

I was in a total of 8 bands over a span of about seven years. I played many shows, made new friends, and realized that playing bass was my #1 passion.

Then I hit some hard times. I had a surgery and lost my job. I was forced to sell all three of my basses to make ends meet for me and my (now) ex-wife. It worked, but bass playing took a major back seat to the bitch called life.

Now fast forward a divorce and two years later, and I'm still bass-less and living in a barn now. And while I don't know when I might ever own a bass again, looking at all of your amazing setups, and reading the talk of some *fantastic* bassists, lets me relive at least a fraction of the feeling I once enjoyed on the stage. And for that, I thank you.

1322525039.0,99,self.Bass,msn2z,So you want to be a great bass player?  This is what it takes...,Astrixtc,116,17,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/msn2z/so_you_want_to_be_a_great_bass_player_this_is/,"First of all, there are and always will be the guys and girls that play just for fun.  This thread is not intended to knock them down in any way.  I'm not here to tell you you suck, or that you're a slacker.  If you are having fun, and that's what you want to get out of it, then that's great!  

There are those of us that for some reason or another want to take our playing to a whole new level.  These are the guys that I am starting this thread for.  I'll be the first to step in and say I don't know everything, so feel free to step in add to the conversation.  Add something I missed, or call me out on anything you think is crap.  Just be sure to justify yourself.  So here's my list:

* **You need lessons.**  I'm not talking internet lessons here.  You need an actual teacher.  Playing with improper technique can cause repetitive stress injuries.  Also, what helps you nail that line today can become a terrible habit and keep you from playing an even better line tomorrow.  Your teacher will be able to point out things to you that aren't problems yet, but will be.  It will also exponentially increase your rate of progress if you aren't wandering and learning random things.  Most importantly of all, you will learn how to communicate with other musicians.  This brings me to my second thing on the list:

* **You need to know music theory.**  You need to know it in your head and in your hands.  You should be able to play every scale in every key.  You should be able to play it over the entire neck with your eyes closed.  When someone tells you to walk up from the 5th on a C# diminished, you should be able to pick up your bass and do it.  You need to be able to read number charts and lead sheets.  You should be able to read music in both treble and bass clefs (because a lot of time, no one is going to take the time to write out a separate lead sheet in bass clef). 

* **You need to practice daily.**  It takes strength and agility to play bass.  You need to stay in shape.  An hour per day is a good start.  The biggest barrier for most intermediate players is endurance.  In the big leagues you should be ready to play for 6-8 hours per day.  Sometimes that means 3-4 hours without a break.  It's possible, but you need to build up to it.  If you want to double and play upright bass too, make sure you spend time on each instrument.  Make sure that you are spending a good amount of time with a metronome because...

* **You need to have a rock solid sense of internal time.**  When playing bass the rhythm is just as if not more important than the notes.  Don't neglect the rhythm.  If you have good rhythm, people will dance.  If people dance, you will be hired and re-hired.

* **You need to play without thinking.**  If you know your rhythm and theory well enough, you can just play, and stop thinking about it.  This opens your mind up to think of more creative and better sounding lines and most importantly...

* **You need to listen.**  Play with the other members of the band.  I can't stress this enough.  If everyone else gets quiet, you need to hear that and do the same.  If you aren't listening, you can't do the final and most important thing and that is...

* **Get over yourself and just play your part.**  Sometimes the gig or song just calls for you to play quarter notes on the root.  If that's what's needed, then that's what you should do.  It's great that you can nail those diminished runs and tri-tone substitutions.  If you do that at the wrong time, you won't be hired back.  After all remember that you're not the lead guitar player.  You are there to make the rest of the band look good.  

* **Actually I did forget one thing:** Through all of this grind, you need to keep it fun.  Being able to play music is awesome.  Don't loose sight of that.  Practicing can seem like a chore sometimes.  Just remember that it could be worse.  You could be sitting in a cube farm rather than learning your modes.

I did, however, find a schematic for the pedal on a very helpful blog and after costing up all the components decided to have a crack at it (it cost me roughly £17 in total. for everything.). 

after much swearing and frustration thanks to my amateurish soldering abilities I had everything put together and ready for a test run. seriously doubting my shoddy workmanship i nervously plugged in my bass and pressed the foot switch... and it worked perfectly!

sadly my only means of recording at the moment is a cassette 4-track so I can't provide any samples but it sounds pretty much exactly like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njwO1hzRNrk).

and here's how it looks!: [http://imgur.com/IQXsc,FpE3R](http://imgur.com/IQXsc,FpE3R)

[here](http://tagboardeffects.blogspot.com.au/) is the site I used for schematics, they have tons of different clones of pedals.

This is a super-useful exercise for building up time keeping skill. 

Get your metronome ticking at 60 bpm for a start (if you don't have one, use this: http://www.metronomeonline.com/). Start with two bars quarter notes, advance to the eights and then to the triplets, and further on to the sixteenth notes (play two bars of each specific note (value)). When you've played the 16ths, start climbing the pyramid. 

Now comes the tricky part: when I'm not paying attention I screw up and sort of forget how to play triplets, and  when advancing to the eight notes from the triplets I tend to slow down a lot, so pay attention to the metronome! For the less advanced players I'd recommend leaving out the triplets for a start.

You can higher the bpm to your liking, but I've found that the slower the beat, the harder it is to keep the playing tight.

Now go, and master your triplets!",,False,self,t5_2qpc3,False,,fender,True,t3_1jiw7a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/1jiw7a/behold_the_rhythm_pyramid/,

Thoughts?,micahjbell,94,10,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/199w89/fun_weekly_or_so_event_idea_thoughts/,"I was thinking of a fun sort of thing we could do on here weekly, or bi-weekly or something. Not necessarily a competition or anything, just something fun for some group interaction and get people doing stuff.

What I had in mind was start a thread where people post song suggestions, then we take the most up voted suggestion and over the next week or two people can record and upload their versions of the baselines. Could either be a note-for-note recording, or a take off on the original with a new interpretation.

I think that it would be cool to see how bassists here interpret and work with baselines, but also it could give some purpose. I know for myself I play bass around my house lots but I don't really ""work"" on songs anymore. I did a sound demo recording last night and used Beck's Sexx Laws as the song which quickly made me remember how much fun I used to have working on baselines but I just don't do it anymore-for me at least this would be a reason to put some effort back into my practicing.

1343667344.0,84,self.Bass,xed1u,I had a nightmare come true on Friday night's gig.  Everything turned out better than expected.  (my shout out to monster cables and Ampeg),Astrixtc,108,24,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/xed1u/i_had_a_nightmare_come_true_on_friday_nights_gig/,"This weekend, I had one of those nightmare moments.  I was playing a show, and the club required us to use their cabinets.  I get there and hook up my amp, and we find out that their speakon jack is busted.  I'm a resourceful guy, so I find a patch cable that just reaches from the amp to the cabinet.

That works great for about 3 tunes, then the patch cable dies.  Apparently a $3 patch cord isn't built to power an 8x10 cabinet.  In a rush, I grab my spare instrument cable from my bag and hand it to the sound guy who does a quick swap.  The rest of the show went amazing until we're on our last tune...

The guy from the opening band is tinkering around back stage and trips over the instrument cable that wasn't run cleanly due to quick swap.  *I watch in horror as my SVT 6 is pulled off of the cabinet and stage for an 8' drop onto the concrete floor.*  I have a quick look at the damage as the band goes into our final breakdown and build up for the show.  The XLR jack is bent in, and still attached to the PA, the instrument cable has been sliced in half.  I throw that amp back on top of the speaker, grab another patch cable, and come in just in time to hit the final epic finale with the band.  

Yesterday, I hit up guitar center, and they exchanged the cable for free, then I went back to the rehearsal spot and bent everything back into place on my amp.  I'm only out two plastic nuts, and one EQ knob.  Everything on the amp is completely functional.  

So I'd like to give a shout out to monster cables and their lifetime warranty with no questions asked.  If you're playing out, it's very worth the investment.  You might be great to your cables, but others may not!  Most importantly, Ampeg makes some serious gear.  I never would have expected a 40 lb tube amp to survive an 8' fall onto a concrete floor and only need about $5 in replacement parts.  

I guess I can have nice things!

During my lunch break from work today I had to stop by the gunsmith (who works out of his home) and he's always playing interesting stuff on speakers around his workshop.  I was reading a magazine when [this song came on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPT3CGe4FS0), which I never heard before.  After about thirty seconds, I put the magazine down and listened intently to the music.  Something just clicked in my mind and I decided that I was going to make two more stops on my break: the grocer and the music shop.  First to pick up a month's supply of ramen and second, to pick up my first bass guitar.

I originally wanted to get a Rickenbacker 4003 (for sentimental reasons, thanks FLCL), but I didn't realize they would be so expensive!  I shuffled between the Fender Standard (Mexican) Precision Bass and Jazz Bass, trying to figure out which one I liked the feel of more and listening to what the salesperson suggested would be the advantages of either style.  I walked out with a Fender Jazz Bass in the Sunburst finish and a 100-watt 15"" amplifier made by Acoustic.

I've spent the last few hours practicing with it and enjoying the hell out of it.  The FAQ here has been really helpful in pointing me to useful resources.  I want to practice doing scales and things first and understanding some of the theory behind assembling music.  I don't have friends who play instruments and I don't know how I would go about joining a band and I'm not really in any music scene (well, I *did* see El Ten Eleven when they were in town, but that's about as wild as I go :P).

Simultaneously, I have begun a quest for music with prominent or interesting bass guitar.  [I've been in love with this recently as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQRV0c1KXYc).

So I just finished my new bass, which I call ""Paisleykiller"". It's my take on both the classic Tele Bass of the 50's and the Paisley Basses of the late 60's, with some of my own twists and ideas. The neck (quartersawn maple), body (alder), pickguard and tuners are from Warmoth, and the rest of the parts of from a variety of sources. The pickup is a Curtis Novak Tele Bass Humbucker, which looks like the old single-coil, but is still a hum-cancelling design. Other features are 21 frets, a thick neck, a string-through bridge, and super heavy knurled knobs. The Paisley was done by ""Sani"", a motorcycle artist from my hometown. It sounds clear, tight and hum/buzz free! It's a real pleasure to play, and it's much lighter than my all-maple Squier Vintage Modified Jazz. All in all, this in now my primary bass; I would definitely build my own again instead of buying a new one!",,False,self,t5_2qpc3,False,,fender-headstock,True,t3_1dpup0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/1dpup0/nbd_i_present_to_rbasspaisleykiller/,

1362251020.0,71,self.Bass,19j8vi,"My Personal Experience of Owning an 11-String ""Bass""",JamesGoodall,90,19,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/19j8vi/my_personal_experience_of_owning_an_11string_bass/,"   I paid for the bass with money from two jobs I'd worked these last two summers. Having been a high school student with minimal bills to pay I figured this would be my last chance to be able to do something of this magnitude for at least another ten years or so. Then in the fourteen months between sending the down payment and picking it up from my school's mail room, I definitely had my doubts about if I should have and if I had made a huge mistake in wasting two summer's work on an instrument I had never played nor had any idea on how to approach. The first thought I had when I opened the box was, ""*Holy shit, this was the biggest mistake of my life. I have no Idea what I'm doing at all!*"" I had gone with 37-32.5"" for the fan to help with tension on the lower strings, but I had no Idea how utterly monstrous the thing would be until I opened the lid of the case for the first time (there is a wooden extension at the end because it won't even fit in a *large* TKL hardcase by about 3"").

   After getting by the initial shock the sheer beauty and immensity of the instrument (I agree, bass is not a fitting term, nor guitar. I propose that Full-Range Instrument would be an apt name), I started playing on it. Sure enough, as with most custom/boutique instruments, the playing was marginally better than any other instrument I had played before, though it had gone a bit out of tune in shipping from NH to Dallas. I was on campus for a two weeks for a mini-term class, and didn't have my rig with me, so I couldn't tune it and had to approximate by ear. That alone took about thirty minutes because with every run of tuning, the change would throw other strings off again.

   Then the only issue I've had came to light. The headstock is a 4/7 configuration of Hipshot Ultralites (40:1) and Sperzel locking tuners (12:1) meaning that starting at the A1 string I had guitar tuners, but the tension was too high for me to twist it by hand so I used pliers, but even then as soon as I brought it up to a quarter-tone shy of pitch the gear would slip and drop me back down to a whole tone flat. I called [Chris Stambaugh](http://www.stambaughdesigns.com), and he was understanding, and told me he even had trouble tuning up to pitch. Twenty minutes later two replacements were in the mail. One the same model as before, and the other a non-locking version. When they arrived, I replaced the broken tuner with the non-locking tuner and went tuned up to pitch with almost no trouble at all.
After that I just started messing around with scales and other exercises to get accustomed to a neck almost twice the size of what I was used to, adjusting my technique to fit the new instrument. Surprisingly, it's very hard to have bad technique and still play well on FRI's. The one thing that is absolutely impossible to do well without is the ""floating thumb"" technique where either you don't anchor your plucking hand anywhere or are constantly moving to rest your thumb two or three strings below the target string. I still have trouble with this, but it's gradually becoming more natural and fluid.

   I’m lucky enough to have an open minded church and peer-group, both of whom let me play it with no question, so long as I don’t fail to fulfill the role of bass in the group. When playing with my church I only play from the F#0 up to F3 strings, primarily playing in the B0 to G2 5-string area, but playing with friends on campus I am given free range to do whatever I like so long as it sits well both harmonically and dynamically, giving me ample opportunity to branch out and experiment with all the different sounds and techniques I and others have dreamed of.

   The most interesting experience had to date was yesterday when me and some friends decided to go to the Guitar Center nearby to pick up some various things; strings, cables, etc., and bring along the 11 string to hear it through the larger amps they had in stock (and I won’t lie, we wanted to see the responses ~~or~~ **of** employees and customers. Cameras were out as soon as I checked in. It was unsettling to say the least as I am not good with making small talk or taking compliments). I fed them a lie that I was looking at buying a new amp, just so I get back into the bass room with it, and every five minutes or so an employee or customer would come by and ask me about it, automatically assuming that because I have so many strings I must be prodigious at bass. More than once I would let someone at their request play it, and stand back watching them shame me with smooth blends of bluesy bass and guitar riffs. I personally can’t play any good bass lines without also being with a guitarist and drummer, so I stuck with my mediocre attempts at tapping, and a few classical-esque pieces I had learned or written that I felt would satiate some people’s desire to see a certain level of skill required to play such an instrument. That to say, it was interesting to see how if you have “nice” or in my case, unique gear you will be looked at as noteworthy or experienced regardless of skill level.

   And that, my friends, is my personal experience from the first six weeks of having an 11-string FRI, typed up at 3 a.m. on a Friday night with much rambling and probably a lot of parts that I have no doubt make no sense whatsoever! If you’d like, here’s a terrible video of me attempting to play it and showcase all the pretty sounds it could potentially make. If you read all the way through, I very much thank you for putting up with me! :)

**TL;DR,** I got an expensive excessive and unnecessary bass because I had the money, wanted one, and realized this would be my last chance to get one for a long time. My friends are accepting of it, and I regrettably get special treatment and excessive attention if I go places with it. But it sounds really good, and I regret nothing!

1321236161.0,70,self.Bass,mbbn9,Things to look for when buying a bass,Astrixtc,78,8,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/mbbn9/things_to_look_for_when_buying_a_bass/,"There are so many threads on here asking for advise about picking out a bass.  I'm not a gear guru by any means, but I do have a decent amount of experience and have played a lot of basses in my time.  I though I'd start a thread about what to look for when buying a bass to spell it out a little better.  Other experienced players please help me add to this discussion.

The most important thing is how the bass feels to you.  Play as many basses as you can and get the one that feels the most comfortable in your hands.  Other than that, there are some basing things that you can easily check.

* The first thing I do is run my fingers down the side of the neck.  I try to feel for frets that stick out.  If I'm unfamiliar with the brand, I use this as an indication of how much time and precision was put into making the bass.  A few frets sticking out a little bit is pretty normal for most basses as the wood will settle a little when it is shipped.  If there are a lot, or they stick out really far, I often stop right there.

* Next I'll look at the from the top of the headstock down the body to check the neck for any twisting.  A twisted neck is a deal breaker.

* Then I check the profile view of the neck.  Here I'm looking for any raised frets.  I also check the setup to know get an idea of what to expect when I finally play the bass.  I'll look at the action, and the curvature of the neck.  I don't worry so much about it because all of that is easily adjusted.  It is a nice indicator though.

* Finally I'll plug the bass in and give it a whirl.  I start with all of the controls flat, and the volume at 10.  I'll play for a little bit to get the feel of the bass, and hear what the natural tone of the bass is before making any adjustments.  If the tone is whack with tone, eq, or whatever else you have on the bass flat, chances are, I won't be able to dial in anything I like.

* Next I'll let the strings ring, and adjust all of the controls all the way up and down a few times to check and make sure that all of the electronics are working like they should.  Listen here for any crackling or popping that could be caused by bad pots or shorts in the wiring.  Also, be sure to listen carefully to what the knobs do, and what their range is for adjustment.  Be careful to make sure that turning knobs results in some sort of change in the sound.  If not, that's another indication that something's not wired correctly.  

* Now that I know what the natural tone is, and what the controls do, I'll finally dial in the tone I want.  It can take a while, but be patient.  Having a good tone will help with the rest of this.

* Next I'll play a fairly easy line to see how I like how the bass feels.  At first I'm looking for how hard I have to play the bass to get the sound I want.  The amount of pressure I need to use for both hands is important.  As a general rule, the less force you need to get a clear note the better.  Well made and well set up basses will respond to very little.

* Now I start experimenting a little bit.  I'll play that same line at different dynamic levels to see how responsive the bass is.  I'll also move my right hand position to see how the pickups react to the changes.  What is the tone like if I pluck over the bridge, near the neck, etc.  I also try some slapping, and palm muting.

* Next I check the harmonics.  At the very least, I need to be able to pull 5th and 7th fret harmonics.  If I can easily pull 3rd and 4th fret harmonics, I know I likely have a good bass.  

* After that, I'll play lines on every string over the whole range of the neck.  I'm looking for spots of fret buzz, or spots where I have to play notes hard, spots where notes don't ring, or the tone changes, and also listening for how in tune the bass stays.  Take all of this with a grain of salt, because everything wrong you find here, can be fixed and adjusted in most cases.  

* Lastly, I just play for a while.  If my hands start cramping up, or I get tired, I know something is likely wrong.  If I don't want to put it down, then chances are I've got a winner.

I hope that helps those of you looking to buy new basses.  Good luck!

**edit: following are points I originally missed:**

* Be sure to get a strap and play the bass standing up.  As Ni_you_jaozi pointed out, you should get a feel for the balance and weight of the bass.  If you are not a big/in shape person a heavy bass, can create neck dive.  It may not be a deal breaker, but it can be one more thing to look out for.  This depends a lot on the player.  If you play often, this issue will go away as you build up strength.  If you only play a few times per week or less often, you may always be fighting it.

* Play the bass unplugged for a while.  As jmoleary pointed out: ""If the acoustic properties of the bass are great then that will translate into the electronics and give you a good tone (barring bad electronics). Play every fret, every string and feel the bass vibrate, see how a droning open string interacts with fingered higher register notes, setup some chords - all just to see how the bass vibrates.""  This is really useful if you're buying a cheap bass and considering upgrading the electronics.

* As gtani pointed out, you should also check for cracks in the wood.  I don't mind scuffs on the body, (unless it's an acoustic bass) but look for cracks along the neck.  While you are at it, you should also make sure that no knobs are loose, the input jack is tight, and also check the bridge and nut.  You can also check the tuning pegs to make sure they are solid.

* one thing that I didn't put up here, and I should have is to make sure you tune the bass before you play it for the first time.  As you play, listen to hear if it stays in tune the entire time.  Hopefully you can hear it, but if you can't plug in a tuner and take note of how far off the notes have shifted.  If the tuning slips, you'll likely need to replace the tuners or possibly parts of or the bridge.  Also, don't worry about how in tune the neck is through out, you can easily adjust that when the bass is set up, unless the bridge isn't adjustable.  What you are listening for here are changes in the intunation over time, not over the neck.",,False,self,t5_2qpc3,True,,fender-headstock,True,t3_mbbn9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/mbbn9/things_to_look_for_when_buying_a_bass/,

So a C, an E-flat and a G walk into a bar. The bartender says, ""sorry, but we don't serve minors."" So E-flat leaves, and C and G have an open fifth between them. After a few drinks, the fifth is diminished and G is out flat. F comes in and tries to augment the situation, but is not sharp enough. A D comes in and heads for the bathroom saying, ""Excuse me. I'll just be a second."" Then A comes in, bu
t the bartender is not convinced that this relative of C is not a minor.

Then the bartender notices B-flat hiding at the end of the bar and says, ""Get out! You're the seventh minor I've found in this bar tonight."" E-Flat comes back the next night in a three-piece suit with nicely shined shoes. The bartender says, ""you're looking sharp tonight. Come on in, this could be a major development."" Sure enough, E-flat soon takes off his suit and everything else, and is au natural. Eventually, C, who had passed out under the bar the night before, begins to sober up and realizes in horror that he's under a rest. So, C goes to trial, is convicted of contributing to the diminution of a minor and sentenced to 10 years of DS without Coda at an up scale correctional facility. The conviction is overturned on appeal, however, C is found innocent of any wrongdoing, even accidental, and that all accusations to the contrary are bassless. The bartender decides, however, that since he's only had tenor so patrons, the soprano out in the bathroom and everything has become alto much treble, he needs a rest and closes the bar.",,False,self,t5_2qpc3,False,,,True,t3_13leg3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/13leg3/music_nerd_humour/,
