I'm super scared. The thing that's really messing me up, is the fact that I have to face a wall of screaming fundies with huge posters of gnarled up fetuses (or victims of infanticide, in some cases) yelling ridiculous things at me for six hours through the thin walls of the Planned Parenthood. This decision did not come easily. No matter how logical the choice to terminate, it's not an easy decision. I don't want kids, and even if I did I couldn't support them right now. Still, it has been extremely difficult to focus through the chaos of my hormones to find the light of reason and rationality. And now, the day has come, and I'm trying to be as strong as I can through this medical procedure (which are always scary for everyone, no matter what,) and I have to deal with crazy christian protesters. I know that atheist doesn't mean you DEFINITELY support a woman's right to choose, even in a women's atheist sub, but I just needed to let off some steam, and was hoping to find some understanding folks in here. Anyway, wish me luck. Or, wish me competent medical professionals. 

Update: Today went very well. It was long and exhausting, but the protesters were pretty impotent, and there was a strong solidarity on the inside of the clinic against them. So strong, in fact, that women were getting to know each other and helping support each other based on their mutual hatred for the protesters. It was a pretty beautiful sight to behold, and to be a part of. In fact, I found another atheist to chat with, and we passed all the down time by talking about atheism, which made the day fly by. I opted for a medication abortion, so the rest of the process is done in my home tomorrow. I'm still pretty scared, but the physical pain in my own home will hopefully be manageable. I want to thank all you godless babes for your support and loving words. It really made what could have been the worst day of my life, a not so bad day. xoxoxo

EDIT: I just wanted to mention this, as something I didn't think about until later. My best friend came with me to the appointment. She was raised by crazy parents who went through a short, but extremist fundie phase. She used to get dragged out to protest outside that very clinic when she was a little kid. I felt all that much better thinking, ""See you fuckers? She's on my team now! You're dying off!"" It felt pretty awesome.

1329505699.0,165,self.GodlessWomen,pu86s,Apparently I can't rescind my church membership because I'm a fucking woman.,insomni666,186,21,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/pu86s/apparently_i_cant_rescind_my_church_membership/,"I just got off the phone with a church deacon, and I'm literally shaking with anger.

My brother is the pastor of the church I once attended, and am still technically a member of. It's a very, very strict sect of Baptist. I talked to him about rescinding my membership (I'm not at all close with my brother, so it was a semi-hostile discussion), and he said that it has never been done before; either people move their memberships, or they are brought up in a deacon's meeting for ""denying the faith"" and are excluded. 

My brother and I reached sort of a compromise-- women are not allowed to speak in business meetings; they must get a man to represent them. I proposed that I attend the deacon's meeting where they talk about my exclusion, and articulate my reasons for leaving, and be there when the exclude me. He said this made sense.

The deacon called me today to say that is not possible, and it would have to be brought up in a business meeting. I said ""okay, so I would be able to articulate my reason for leaving, because I'm a member and I'm speaking about my own membership. Right?""

""Well... our procedure doesn't allow for that.""

""Because I'm a woman.""

""Yes, our procedure doesn't allow women to speak in business meetings. That's just how it is.""

""I made a conscious decision to join the church, I should be able to make a conscious decision to leave it. You're saying that a legally consenting adult in the state of Maryland cannot talk in a church business meeting because your sexist procedures don't allow for it?""

""well, I can speak for you. To say, you know, that for whatever reason you've suddenly decided god doesn't exist anymore.""

""I am a member of your church, I deny your doctrines, your god, and your procedures. This is not a sudden decision; I've been trying to get my membership off your books for almost five years now. I would like to articulate my own reason.""

""Well, you can't do that.""

After several minutes of this, he gave me a ""well, if you don't want to be involved in the proceedings (...how *CAN* I be? They won't let me talk!) we'll just go on with the exclusion without you, since obviously what you're describing to me is that you don't believe in god and that is grounds for exclusion. But you're always welcome to come back.""

I gave him a cheerful ""I won't, and this is part of the reason why I'm attempting to severe all affiliation with your church in the first place. Goodbye.""

I called my brother to re-discuss the compromise we'd talked about before, and he went all hardened christian asshole on me. No, you can't attend the meeting, no, you can't talk in business meeting, all you want to do is make some statement and cause a scene, and we can't allow that. Just quietly be excluded.

It angers me that they won't let me have a say in my own membership because of my gender.
It angers me that they're perpetuating their bigotry, and my brother will raise his kids this way, and the cycle of ignorance will just keep going. 
It angers me that reason has no effect whatsoever on them. And it never will, because they propagate this ignorance and block out everything else. Fuck this, fuck churches, fuck religion. I can't believe this.

Could this law make way for ""pregnancy laws"" regulating a woman's ability to choose how she drinks, eats, excercises and works during her pregnancy as well? I'm interested in what others think because it seems that during discussion of all these personhood lalws, this is never brought up.

1336857918.0,74,self.GodlessWomen,tk4f2,Am I the only one that feels uncomfortable when /r/atheism says that religious women who are religious by choice have Stockholm Syndrome?,,89,15,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/tk4f2/am_i_the_only_one_that_feels_uncomfortable_when/,"It just leaves a bad taste in my mouth for a number of reasons. 

For one thing, the term is only thrown at religious women, not religious men. When men say that they are voluntarily religious, presumably, they are taken at their word. To diminish the actions of women, while not doing the same for the actions of men, is to reinforce the 'men act, women are acted upon' meme as it currently exists in society. Since the community also doesn't question the actions of women who choose to be atheist, there's also the implication that, while men always have agency, women only do so if they choose what makes them feel more comfortable. 

I also find that it diminishes the complicated relationship that many religious people, including women, have with faith. Lots of atheists grew up in religious families, and many of them probably spent years contemplating whether or not they believed in God. I know I did. However I have found that this is also true of many religious people that I know; the only difference is that they went the other way. People are complicated and reducing the complicated thoughts and actions of another group of human beings to something simple like ""they're abused and don't know any better"" is dehumanizing. 

Lastly, there is nothing at all revolutionary about portraying women as helpless damsels in distress. ""We treat our women better than they treat there's"" has been war propaganda for millennia.

&gt; As a nursing student years ago, I was present at several newborn circumcisions, and it left an impression. A tiny, days-old baby boy is brought in, stripped naked, his arms and legs strapped down to a plastic board under the glare of brilliant surgery lights. A nurse (sometimes the nursing student) dips a pacifier into sugar water and plugs the crying infant's mouth with it; the doctor swabs the genital area with Betadine or chlorhexidine, places a sterile drape, and injects lidocaine or marcaine around the penis. The infant turns purple from screaming, in spite of the pacifier. The physician pinches the foreskin with forceps to test for numbness; needless to say this isn't too pleasant if the penis isn't yet numb. He then uses a sharp spatula to separate the synechiae that adhere the foreskin to the glans, pulls the foreskin up, attaches one of two different devices (Plastibell or Gomco being the most common) and cuts away. It's bloody and in no way painless for the infant. The visibly upset baby is then diapered, swaddled and returned to his parents, who usually are not present at the actual procedure....and all this because the parents want him to ""look like Dad"". Most aren't up on the actual disease-prevention stats; it's much more likely just to be done because every other male in the family had it done. 

&gt;The ethical problems with this were apparent to me even as a green student. It's a medically unnecessary invasive procedure done to a patient incapable of giving consent. Whatever slight future reductions in STDs or urinary infections it may or may not bring hardly seem to outweigh the very real risk of complications of the procedure itself. We don't perform appendectomies or tonsillectomies on neonates to prevent future appendicitis or tonsillitis - why cut off a perfectly normal, healthy body part for some vague future problem that can easily be handled with hygiene? It's obvious that its just a cultural thing that has its roots in religious superstition and sexual taboos and misplaced fears and distorted body images. Time for it to go the way of Chinese foot-binding and Aztec skull-molding.",,False,self,t5_2t6l7,False,,,True,t3_1diuda,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/1diuda/powerful_post_on_circumcisions/,

I pointed out to him that, since he's in college, he ought to realize that 50% plus 50% equals 100% so that leaves no room for North America, Europe and Australia where people generally are not starving.

He says well he's not good at math but he loves him some Jesus.

So I asked him, what about people who aren't born in America?  Does Jesus love them less?  Should they curse God because they weren't born in America?  What sins could they have committed without even being born yet so that God would make them be born somewhere horrible?

Of course he couldn't answer that, just gave me an uncomfortable look and went about his business.

The truly frightening part is that not only is he in college, but he votes.  And he's gay, but he hides this from his family because there are 2 preachers in his immediate family who say, publicly and often, that homosexuality is a sin.

I just wanted to share this because I was so happy to be a godless woman today!

I do encourage it to a certain extent. After all, I feel it is a decision for him to make on his own when he is old to enough to understand and do his own critical thinking. I will love him either way. 

My problem lies in the fact that his Aunt and Uncle on his dads side (we are not together and he is in and out of his life whenever it feels convenient for him) were taking him to church without my permission. Their son goes to a private CRC school. Maybe they just assumed I was religious? After finding out about my atheism thanks to facebook, they now ask permission....most of the time. 

In school, they have these tudor programs that are based out of a church. That's fine, but now they are coming to my door and taking him to youth group. My son wants to go because of his friend and the activities they do. He is quite naturally athletic. He 'says' he doesn't pay attention to the lessons, and I feel that is only to appease me. Now there is another group that has all these sports facilities and is a fundie youth ministry at the same time. 

I feel he is almost being peer pressured into these activities to fit in with his friends and to be able to play the sports he loves. Then I end up feeling like the bad parent for not allowing him to hang with his buds and play sports. (He does play little league and rocket football, this is just fun, extra play time for him.)

My son and I talk about religion. I tell him he needs to know about it before he can have an opinion for or against, theistic or non-theistic. Also, judging some of the ridiculous things that come out of his mouth, for example, ""We don't have to take off our hats at the dinner table because we're not Christian."" I think he is having a hard time distinguishing the differences. I had to correct him in front of his friends and say that this was a fun dinner. That at a restaurant, hats would come off because that is etiquette. But he is also only 11 years old. I also don't want to take the religious path and force my beliefs down his throat. I want to be better than that. I feel like it is a game of tug of war right now.

During my years of high school, I was in one of the less popular clubs and became quite close to the advisor and her daughter. The advisor is now a mentor of mine and her daughter and I are friends. One night, I was playing cards with our usual social circle at their house when I said something in passing about my lack of belief. (Everyone close to me is well aware of how I feel about religion as a whole, so it's not like it was a shock to them.) I honestly hadn't realized I'd said something even related until the advisor responded with a phrase I still recall clearly several months later:

""Why can't you just be agnostic?""

At the time, I thought nothing of it. I remember not responding, or possibly laughing at what she said as if the entire issue were a joke. In fact, I don't remember anything else about that night except that phrase and how I didn't respond. She probably doesn't even remember saying it, but it still bothers me that she said such a thing. To think that she wrote off my thoughts, beliefs, and feelings with just a single statement tears me apart inside. To know that she hasn't taken my stance on religion seriously all the five years I've known her makes me feel like everything I've said to her has gone in one ear and out the other. I understand that she's 40 years older than me and she's set in her ways, but it still irks me like few other things have before.

I may be just under 20, but I'm still a human being. I'm an intelligent, talented, and hard-working young woman. I deserve to have what I say and feel be respected just as much as anyone else, regardless of what their beliefs are. So why do I feel like all of that is violated by those around me? Why do I feel like people are trying to put me down simply because I don't believe in some vague higher power that's supposed to do things to make the world better, but hasn't done anything personally for me?

Why must we live in a world where it is supposed to be okay to be different, but at the same time it's so wrong to go against the status quo? When did it become better to fake it and go with the flow than to stand up for what is right, even if it means calling out mankind for its many flaws and wrongdoings?

I suppose I may never find the answers to those questions, but they're mostly rhetorical anyways. For those of you that read this, thank you for doing so. And if you didn't, I'm okay with that.

**Obligatory TL;DR: A female mentor of mine made me feel like a lesser person by asking me why I couldn’t “just be agnostic” as opposed to being atheist. The only questions I have are rhetorical, and this is mostly me ranting and reflecting on my feelings.**",,False,self,t5_2t6l7,False,,,True,t3_10jhqi,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/10jhqi/why_cant_you_just_be_agnostic/,

Basically, my goal as a parent is to try to teach them how to think as critically as possible and to examine the world around them through that lens - so whatever conclusions they reach regarding religion will at least be *informed* conclusions. My daughter has so far decided that atheism makes the most sense to her, and puts Jesus and gods in the same bin she puts Santa and the Easter Bunny, while my son thinks maybe there's a god of some sort, but isn't sure yet.

Anyway, that's just a little background for context for this: I was just having a discussion about the recent Girl Scouts/transgender flap with my boyfriend, which then led to a bit of banter about how frustrating it is to try to live in a Christian dominated culture. 

My daughter, who is almost 10, was in the room, reading while we were talking, and said, ""Yeah, that's why I hide it - I don't want everyone to hate me.""

Annnnd...my heart broke, y'all. I asked her how she came to that conclusion, and she said she figured it out after several of her classmates told her she was bad and going to hell. She's not quite 10, and she's already learned that to admit your atheism is to invite hatred, and that she therefore needs to hide it so her peers don't shun her. I asked her how that makes her feel, and she said, ""Eh - I don't care, I know I'm not bad or going to hell, it's just easier this way for now."" 

Sigh.

My coworker was almost raped when she was younger but the wind blew the door open and he thought someone was coming and ran away.

This is her direct quote:

""after that, i learned that God only puts us through what we can handle, and there is a reason he was wanting me to learn how to deal with things like that

maybe it was so that i can be a better mother

When I was in school at the University of Texas at Arlington, a local group hoping to train people on cultural sensitivity put on a play.  In it, the women served men food.  The men, of course, ate first.  And the women waited, sitting on the ground, for them to finish.  We were all offended.  And then, at the end of the play.  The organizers say:

""We are often offended by other cultures simply because we don't understand them.  In this play, you probably thought the women were being mistreated.  But actually, in this fake culture we create for this play, these women serve the men first because they are honored as mothers who feed the children and men first.  And they sit on the ground, not because they are inferior, but because the Earth is revered and so only they have the right to sit so close to it and men cannot.""

And of course, we were all supposed to walk away going ""gosh, maybe I just don't understand other cultures.""  Except the whole thing is a bunch of bullshit.  If the subjugation of women by religion had anything to do with those kinds of ideals, it might be one thing, but we know this is a giant strawman and non-sequitur.  All the religions that demand women eat second, men eat first, and women don't sit with the men, believe so because they feel women are inferior to men.  I walked away feeling more offended and more determined that religions were fucking bullshit.

TL;DR: you can't create fake, positive arguments for why women should subjugate themselves when the reality is, cultures that push for this do not have legitimate positive arguments for this treatment.",,False,self,t5_2t6l7,False,,,True,t3_wiw9c,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/wiw9c/patronizing_defense_of_subjugation/,

We are a community focused on discussing and promoting topics pertaining to atheism in not only the black but all minority communities.


After reading  the side panel of /r/GodlessWomen, and a few of the topics on this board I see that you all face the same critiques about the necessity and purpose of a group focused on advancing and defending atheism in your respective community.

It seems that at times [/r/Atheism](/r/Atheism) can choose to overlook the concepts that minority and marginalized groups face and often seek to brush such concerns under the rug under the unaware cover of majority ""privilege."" 

Members of [/r/BlackAtheism](/r/BlackAtheism) often face the critique of outsiders who issue charges of self-segregation and race/ethnic-baiting as a means of saying that we should ""all be one""

I have personally witnessed members of not only [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) but other groups partake in jokes, slurs, and other insensitive comments that fail to show the degree of open-mindedness and community that many of them claim to possess.

1349833210.0,48,self.GodlessWomen,11880b,How do I forgive my parents?,flyonawall,58,10,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/11880b/how_do_i_forgive_my_parents/,"My parents were missionaries.  They left me and my siblings in boarding school while they went off to do ""gods work"".  My mother says she didn't worry about us because she was sure god would take care of us since they were busy with ""gods work"".

I was 5 years old when I started boarding school.  I was tortured with electric shocks and routinely raped.  I was verbally and physically abused.   

By the time I was 10, I couldn't tell reality from fantasy and often struggled to ""keep my feet on the ground"".  I was confused, my memories of that time are random bits, all out of order.  They make no chronological sense.  

I literally would feel like I would float away from my body.  At first there was a reason to ""float away"", but eventually it got out of hand.  I was afraid to be outside because I wouldn't have a roof to stop my ascent.  Outside I would ""float"" all the way up to above the clouds and it would be so cold and isolated there.  I hated floating away.  It was such a powerful sensation that I thought I was actually leaving my body behind.  It would happen in school sometimes too.  I would ""float"" to the ceiling of the classroom and struggle to return to my body.  I fought the sensation but it was so strong.

When I was older, I just thought I was crazy.  I don't really know how but I did eventually stop floating away after we moved away from the boarding school.  I'm not sure when that happened but by the time I was 13 or 14, I didn't have to struggle with it anymore.  I left it behind.

Later in life I began to piece it together and understand it better but I had a bit of an internal communication problem.  Some parts of me understood, some parts of me did not.  It took a long time to come out of the fog of confusion.  I wrote a book, but I haven't been able to finish it.

And that is the crux of it.  Unresolved issues.  I feel nothing for my parents.  I feel almost nothing for my siblings.  My parents are getting old.  They will probably pass in the next few years.  I keep thinking I need to ""fix' something before they go.  But I feel nothing for them.  I pretend when I am around them.  I imagine I will feel bad when they die but I can't seem to really feel much of anything.

There was a time I was angry with them.  That hurt them.  I think I am still angry, maybe, but I know I should forgive them.  I know I should ""fix"" this.  I just can't seem to do that.

They still cling to religion and their god and that bothers me.  They still claim god is great, god is good.  They seem to think that what happened was meant to happen.  They still love the church and their god.  That bothers me.

edit:  I re-read the comments today.  Thanks so much.  The child-like part of me wishes she had known some of you long ago, or at least heard your words somewhere, but I am glad that at least, this (sometimes crabby) old lady part of me feels better now.  (smiling) Amazing, the power of a kind word, even a written word.

Has this happened to anyone else?",,51,8,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/s6ofe/became_an_atheist_recently_and_its_had_a_profound/,"I used to be a ""spiritual Agnostic."" While I was unsure if there was a creator, I still believed that people had a sort of spiritual form adjacent to their corporeal form and that the spiritual form transcended the corporal form in lifespan. This meant that, while I did not necessarily believe in God, I did believe in past lives, reincarnation, and the presence of ""souls."" 

The more I have learned about the properties of matter, the more skeptical I became that reincarnation could be possible, and the more I learned about neurology, the more skeptical I became of the idea that people had ""souls."" 

I identify as atheist now. I do not believe in God, life after death, or that my lifetime is meant to fulfill any sort of metaphysical ""purpose."" 

Because of this, I've become aware of the finality of my actions in a way that I was not before, and recognizing that my lifespan is both purposeless and limited has been emotionally difficult for me. I used to think that your soul and those of your friends would intertwine across multiple lifetimes. Now that I know that I will only know my friends for one lifetime, and this has made me cautious about neglecting my friendships.  

In particular, I have noticed that I want to revisit relationships with men that were important to me but who I did not part with on good terms. I used to think that if you had an awkward relationship with someone, your soul and there's could revisit it in another lifetime. Now that I do not think this is the case anymore, I find myself wanting to get in touch with these guys again and reconcile with them before we cease to exist. 

All of these changes suggest that my lack of belief in a spiritual lifetime has led to me being more aware of my corporeal lifetime.  It has also made it difficult for me to let go of the mistakes that I have made with others. Has this happened to anyone else?

The idea is to give credit to some of the ladies that the artist of the other piece chose to leave out, and to highlight the influence &amp; accomplishments of women whose contributions are so often marginalized.

So who would you put in the picture? Here's a good list of female atheists: http://www.blaghag.com/2010/01/large-list-of-awesome-female-atheists.html But I can't draw all of them.

List the women you would most like to see depicted. Whether it's one person you really don't want me to leave out, or 10 you can't choose among.

I thought I would share part of it with this subreddit that I recently shared, let me know what you think. I felt like writing it was a catharsis. I have to present this to my entire class this week.**





At the just barely ripe age of fifteen, I became an Atheist. 

That’s right, I said it: an atheist. I’ve been living in a hole where few know I lie, discouraged from coming out for fear of persecution and disdain from all corners. My family has been Southern Baptist going back so far that it probably has roots with the separation from other Christian sects. The love of God burns in my parents veins so strongly that I have been told that “As long as you love Jesus, Sarah, we will love you.” To my parents, that may have been something that made total sense to them, how could I not love Jesus for the rest of my life? 

How could I extricate myself from something that defines our family so strongly that it almost defines them? Surely, this is just a phase, right? Everyone has doubts, right? These are things I asked myself when my parents dropped me off at the Upper Room to mingle, mix and listen to the word of God. Or when they shipped me off to church camp for two weeks one summer to listen to the same five songs three times a day and memorize Bible verses that I am positive I do not have the capability to ever forget.

A Douglas Adams quote comes to mind every time I think about these formative years of my lack of belief: “He hoped and prayed that there wasn’t an afterlife. Then, he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasn’t an afterlife.” Experiencing this extreme doubt, knowing that it was a sin to live my life without god, these words have never rung more true… 

The idea of some bearded man up in the sky wielding the world’s every decision, every move, seemed insanely bizarre to me. The idea that there is a magical book where everyone gets their directions in life and where they believe morality has stemmed from, that just gets me. The ridiculous, dated, and hateful words that I have read while examining the bible disgust me. My parents are against gay marriage, but still wear polyester, just saying…

I’m not Christian bashing, please do not get me wrong, I am just venting. I am seeking understanding. I do not believe that after I die there is some special place to go to be with those I’ve known through life. I believe that life is what you make it: your experiences are what you have. You live life and you die, but it’s the breaths that fill the space between that define you, that make your life worth it. I do not live by another’s rule book. I do not pray for help in tough situations, I ask for help from those I know are capable and I act. 

Let us be real here, just for a minute. Religion does not define a person. Actions, thoughts, movements and words do. It’s the things that are in real time, the things that are visible to others. The man who raped me was given two Christian names, went to church twice a week and sang in the choir. The man who physically and mentally abused me, then stole my car, claimed that he was a follower of God. My parents who sat idly by while this was going on are Christians. A woman who told me I should kill myself because I complained about a migraine one day at work has never missed a day of church in her life. Do I consider these people to be people of faith? No. I do not define them by their faith; I define them by their actions.

I don’t believe that I have to marry to prove my love to my partner. I don’t believe that I have to procreate in honor of my god’s wishes. I do not write this to boast about my lack of faith. I write about this to speak for other women out there who feel the same way, but feel like they cannot say anything. Yes, I still feel maternal instincts around children – it’s my instinct. Yes, I still love that my parents have been married for twenty five years, monogamous and happy. But, we do not all live within the confines of these outlines that were laid before us, this pre-planned life span that the patriarchy expects us to perpetuate.

Living without a religion has lent to me the power to embrace my womanhood. I am more comfortable with my body, even with all that it has been through. I know what it can handle. I know what it can do. I know that I do not belong to a man. I know that my body is my own to make choices with. You know, things like whether I want a tattoo or piercing, whether I want to use contraceptives of any sort, whether I want to eat meat on Friday, how I don’t want to marry the man that raped me, whether I want to hold my boyfriend’s hands when I’m on my period, whether I want to have pre-marital sex or not (all of which, of course, are banned in the Christian faith)…  

I feel free. Independent. Alive. Yet, still connected to the earth in a way that I cannot quite explain.

So many people in passing have said to me that I have no hope, that they do not understand how I can accept living in an immoral way. Immoral? Simply because I do not attend church or claim your god as my own? I am not to be pigeonholed in some stereotype that claims that all good deeds stem from religion. According to the Good Without God Campaign, Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have both donated billions more to charities to help out those that need it, while Pat Robertson simply judges people and asks for their money. 

I volunteer and I give to charity. I smile at strangers. I give directions, to my best ability. I would never steal or cause harm to another on purpose. I still say “Happy Holidays.” I feel guilty after I gossip. I love my homosexual, bisexual, transsexual and straight friends equally, without judgment. I don’t accuse others of going to a place where you are damned for eternity and suffer endlessly simply because we disagree about something that simply seems too personal to even talk about with others. 

My atheism has not affected those that I have made friends with, how many of the women in this class had any idea? I believe in equality on all bases – gender, sex, race, sexuality and religion (or lack thereof). This nation is too great to waste time hating each other, let’s just melt together in this pot and create something better.

How does an atheist find comfort after the death of a loved one?",Put-A-Bird-On-It,49,8,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/1j01w3/my_brother_just_passed_away_and_i_dont_know_how/,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but it seemed the most appropriate subreddit. I (27 F) recently lost my 22 year old brother in a motorcycle accident. We had our differences and arguments over the years, but when it came down to it he was my best friend and I am honored to call him my brother. He started going down the wrong path in high school and dropped out, hung out with a bad crowd, experimented with drugs, and wasn't doing anything with his life. The last few years he turned himself around, was studying for his GED, got a job and worked his way up to supervisor, and was preparing to join the academy to become a sheriff. He was funny, shy, handsome, and he did so much for me. I was so proud of the man he had become. He was the only person in my family who shared my views on religion, and that I could talk to about atheism. My entire family (grandma, mom, uncles, aunts, cousins...a lot of them) were all raised catholic and are all very religious. 


Dealing with the loss of my brother has been very difficult for all of the usual reasons. I have guilt for not trying harder to talk him out of buying a motorcycle. I am depressed of course. Going through the usual things one goes through when they experience grief over the loss of a loved one. But one thing that I am going through differs from everybody else in my family. They are all comforted by the fact that my brother is in heaven, in eternal bliss. They are comforted by the fact that he is not suffering, is protected by God, and that they will all see him again someday. They all feel that they can talk to him and he will hear them. I have been looking into bereavement counseling in my area, but they are heavily revolved around religion. 


My question for you is; how do we, as atheists, find comfort after the death of a loved one? Sometimes I wish I did believe in god, I can see how it comforts others in times like this. I can see how it would make death easier to deal with; believing we get to see our loved ones again in heaven. But the fact is, I am an atheist and that is not going to change. I really have nobody to talk to about this. The last time I lost somebody who I was really close with, I was 7 years old and my grandpa passed away. I have no idea how to navigate through this. I am looking for responses with your advice, experiences, wisdom, comforting words, even resources for atheists who are in need of grief counseling. Anything you want to say, I am looking forward to reading it. If this is the wrong place to post this, please let me know, and recommend a better sub to post in. 


TL;DR-My brother passed away, and my family is very religious. As an atheist, I am having trouble finding comfort after his death. ",,False,self,t5_2t6l7,False,,,True,t3_1j01w3,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/1j01w3/my_brother_just_passed_away_and_i_dont_know_how/,

And, women's issues either getting ignored or a few get a ""nice tits"" comment.  I'm glad that we can have more serious conversations.  

I wanted a place for women to feel like they were in a safer place and to be able to talk about topics important to them, to organize and be confident in being an atheist woman.  We may not all agree on everything. That's great.

I've been following Jessica Ahlquist's case for a few months now, as have many in this community and I've found her positively inspiring. I was overjoyed when she rightly won her case against the school. Miss Ahlquist has shown herself to be an incredibly strong-willed person, facing school bullies as well as bigoted adults, but the fact that this state representative has publicly attacked her is outrageous.

Palumbo has called Miss Ahlquist an ""evil little thing"" as well as asserting that she is brain-washed and ""being coerced by evil people"" (secularists.) This is totally unacceptable.

**Rep. Palumbo responded to the justifiable outrage in response to his personal attack on Jessica Ahlquist by closing his e-mail and not picking up his phone.**

This one is long, but I needed to share with someone.",throwaway1506,40,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/1bu3rc/a_mother_of_god_and_a_godless_daughter_this_one/,"Good evening Godlesswomen. Not sure if this is the correct place to post.....

I had an interesting experience this evening with my mother and I thought that if there is any group of people, or even any one single person out there who might understand the interaction between mother and daughter, especially regarding religion, it would be here. This is going to be a long one, and if no one reads I don’t even care I just need to get this out there and off my chest. 

**TL;DR: in a dramatic and tense conversation with my mother I took another step solidifying myself identity, and put another brick in the bridge that seems to be pushing me further and further from my family.**

I was raised in a very religious Christian family, to the point that when I moved to the city it was a huge culture shock. After two years getting used to city culture (and a lot of drama) I was finally ready for academia. I took care of everything when it came to researching my courses and plotting out my path to get my diploma and the finances I would need. I was really excited about going to school and that I’d finally found a program that would put me in the industry I want to be in (Cultural Administration). My dad has always been really supportive and excited for me regardless of what I’m doing so long as I’m happy and healthy I always know he will love me unconditionally. My mum on the other hand was fairly neutral and feigned excitement but I wasn’t really sure if she was excited or upset. (later when she found out that I was able to get free tickets to just about any show in the city if I was working it all of a sudden she was really excited, but for the most part she doesn’t really care). 

My mother and I have always had a tumultuous relationship (she has a lot of psychological problems that make it hard to build a trusting relationship). Every time we spend too much time together we end up getting on to some topic or another that sends her off on a rant of some sort, always has. I’ve brought up a few times that I identify as an atheist (I said agnostic for a lot of years which she was okay with) but she always glazes over it or ignores me completely.  

I’m spending the weekend out in the country at their house doing homework and laundry because my building had a fire in the laundry room, and I *need* clean laundry. I was talking about the neighbors across the hall that smoke so much that my apartment smells like a lounge so I burn incense to cover the smell, and how they complained about my burning incense. I said something to the effect of “if I were a Buddhist or part of a religion that uses incense in their practices I could claim it as a religious right. As an atheist I don’t get religious exemptions from the rules so I might as well claim some if I can.” I figured this would go unnoticed as it usually does and barely contribute to the conversation, it was intended to be more of a joke really. She paused for a moment, and got that “fuck you” look on her face that used to send chills down my spine when I was a kid. 

“So you don’t believe in god?” 

Well damn, here I am. This is everything I’ve prepared for. All that research in my free time, reading all those books, taking that painstaking journey through challenging my upbringing and questioning my faith, all the emotion I’ve poured thus far into developing a solid self-affirmation of who I am. Taking anthropology electives this last year has made me really confident in my resolution. Ten years ago I would have balked at the question, caved and ultimately said something like “yes, well mostly, well I’m not sure, but for the most part, but kind of in a different way….” But for the first time I put on my big girl panties. The thought that I would be disowned loomed overhead. I remembered something that a guidance counselor said to me once “if someone wants nothing to do with you because of something you do or don’t believe on a deeply personal level that only affects *you*, you didn’t want them in your life anyway.” But this is my mother. She will effectively cut me off from my entire family if she feels so inclined, and if they don’t cave then she’ll revert to her suicidal tendencies to make me feel guilty. I took a deep breath and without hesitation felt the words fall from my mouth as naturally as breathing. 

“No. No I don’t.” 

Her body tensed and her face tightened. Her lip began to quiver like it does when she’s trying with all her might to refrain from showing complete disgust. The same face she would give when we talked back, or got a bad grade on our report card. The face that looked down when I broke my brother’s arm wrestling (it was by accident he’s three times my size), or when I tore my leg open climbing a tree she told me not to climb. Only this time there was a layer deeper underneath, that deeper layer was steeped in hate and loathing. It was the face that I saw at church book burnings when she piled on Harry Potter and Origin of The Species only this time there was no satisfaction. 

“Really.” 

That was all she managed to say. It was less of a question and more of a statement or an accusation. I did my best to keep my cool. We debated, actually a really healthy debate, for about an hour. I explained my point of view; I’m good for the sake of being good, I accept responsibility for my actions in this life and acknowledge that I am the only one who can be held responsible for my actions, and that I hope when I leave this earth regardless of where I go there will be no bad memories of me. We talked back and forth for a while; I did not try to defend myself but only to explain. I did not try to dispute any of her points regardless of how much I disagreed; I only said that I understand completely why people feel that way but that it was not something that fit into my life. She started getting really passionate about how evolution is only a theory. Her voice rose and she put aside her knitting to get her hands into the conversation

“You can’t tell me, no one can tell me, that you can take a bunch of random somethings and put them in a box, shake it up, and get a wrench. I didn’t come from monkeys, my mother was not a monkey, and if we all came from monkeys why are there still monkeys? They’ve proven all of Darwin’s *ideas* to be just that. It’s a theory! You can’t prove a theory!”

Man was it hard to keep my mouth shut. Eventually I did speak up

“So is gravity.”

“No it’s not it can be proven.”

“No, on a molecular or atomic level the ‘laws’ of gravity start ceasing to apply. We can’t even fully explain what gravity is, or why gravity is, we just have an abstract idea of the effects of what we call gravity.”

“Well the molecular and atomic level don’t mean shit. I only care about the stuff that affects human sized things, and evolution is just a theory based on an idea which makes it a lie.” 

I wanted to rage. I wanted to scream and go off on all the rants I’ve seen around reddit, and in books, and in lectures, and in journals, and papers, and peer reviewed documentation. But then in a beautiful and serene moment I remembered something that she herself used to say when I was a kid. “A man convinced against his will is of the same conviction still.” And I kept my mouth shut. Later she even said

“I believe in mutation, we can see mutations happening today. But that is *not* evolution.” 

I didn’t even argue. I just let her have her way. For a while I almost felt jealous, I wish I could explain my life only using one book. I wish so many people in the world believed the same thing that I did. I wish sometimes it was that easy.  Sometimes I wish that I could pray and feel like that was the solution, I wish I had someone to talk to night and day and feel like they were unconditionally aware and loving and empathetic to my feelings. 

Then I felt sad. I almost mourned for my mother that she would never experience the exciting and exhilarating experience of learning something new about the world around you. That new and uncomfortable feeling when you begin to challenge what you believe to attain personal inner peace and understanding would never be fun for her, it would only be threatening. I wish she could feel the wonder and excitement I felt in my first anthropology lecture or the ground beginning to shift under my feet when I read “The God Delusion” for the first time. The first time that I felt like if I didn’t believe in god that didn’t mean that I would be alone, desolate, forsaken, or doomed. That would never be a level of enlightenment my mother would get to experience because she was blinded by years and years of indoctrination and hate.  For the first time today though I did get to feel something new; the feeling that I am completely alone in my life right now and I am okay with that. I can do this without god, without church, and without the bible. I can do this with the lessons I’ve learned, and the knowledge I have. 

I’m not asking for you to contribute, I’m not asking for advice, and I’m not asking for sympathy. I just wanted to put my thoughts somewhere so that when I drift off into the eternal naught maybe someone can benefit from my thoughts in some way. 

edit: clarity, grammar.

who can grant any miracle, from the glorious heavens above

But, devastation isn’t only me when dealt the hardest hand.

The ones so close suffer fatally, disaster mutilates foreign lands.

To live in a world that some disdain, while others live so fair

How can I trust a god like you, when you’re not even there?

No faith have I in any God who's name is used in war

I hold myself to high esteem, this is what I’m standing for;

Strong is the woman who has no sins to hold

Forgiveness for myself is when I set my morals wrong

I'm letting go of God today, for prayers are just disaster

The Quiverfull movement is based on having large families, as many as would naturally occur without birth control, in order to show submission to God's will, and to spread the religion.

Some relevant links:

[Quiverfull on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiverfull)

[No Longer Quivering - blog run by former Quiverfull adherents](http://nolongerquivering.com/)

[Razing Ruth - blog of a woman who ran away from a Quiverfull family as a teenager](http://razingruth.blogspot.com/)

I discovered this movement through reading about it on the forums at mothering.com (which has an interesting mix of left wing and right wing, and also lots of fundamentalist religious people).  Interestingly enough, some of the women there find out about the Quiverful movement, and want to convince their reluctant husbands to convert to the movement. It is not always forced on helpless women by their husbands or fathers, it has some aspects that are appealing to some modern women. 

I think it is interesting because this movement is essentially subsidised by modern technological society, which allows families to provide for 10+ children often through internet based businesses (i.e. selling quiverful based home schooling materials to other quiverful members).  Also modern health care allows such large families to exist, and the women to survive repeated childbearing.

I found it interesting that some women in the movement will often describe ""competetive piety"", in which their family will start at one church, gradually become more modest and fundamentalist than anyone else,  and then eventually move to another stricter  church, and then finally end up with the father of the family leading his family in prayer at home, because the churches were too corrupt and godless.

I was raised Pentecostal Christian and am now ""out"" as an atheist. It was a long time coming and if anyone cares about the journey: http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/z8cun/former_christianhow_it_happened/

Anyway, I was thinking about children. I have run myself by a set of values and morals for some time outside of Christianity. There are things in my life that I feel are good to do because that's how *I* feel. There are people, including Christians, who tell me that I'm too nice or too generous when I help out friends or total strangers but I feel that it's the right thing to do. 

I'm saying this to show that yes, I have a set of morals of my own accord so I know that it's definitely possible. My question is this: **When you were a child and being told that something was right or wrong, what did your parents say as an incentive to follow this moral code?** Again, I don't think you need religion to show morals but I don't know how children would respond to it. For us, it was the shame of disobeying god that was supposed to keep us in check. Even spankings and grounding didn't keep us from doing things that mom said were bad, but for certain things we weren't supposed to do ""because god doesn't want you to do them"" are the things we never did. What is the incentive for atheist children? 

Again, I'm not asking because I think that religion is the way to go and that morals come from religion or anything. I am asking because I'm sure there's something that you folks grew up with and would like to know what that is in order to pass that on when/if I have kids.

I disagree, thinking that that which is constant and mundane becomes part of who we are more than sudden events. Our habits create who we are and the same holds true for the state and society. God as a given is what we must challenge; why is it taken for granted that there is a God and that you must be one of the people who believe in this God? Saying ""Bless You"" is saying that God will shield you from becoming ill. You may as well anoit a person's head with oil and give them the sign of the cross. We must bring Gesundheit and Dammit into the vernacular as much as possible so maybe people will actually stop and consider how ridiculous it is to suggest that one can actually damn a person to hell. The idea that religion deserves reverence or acceptance has lead to all sorts of abuses of power, from child rape to financial fraud to slavery to murder. 

Sexism is the same. It's the mundane expectations of the everyday that create patterns and beliefs. Women have to look like this, men have to look like this, women have to be nurturing,sexless and sensitive, men have to be emotionally distant from themselves and hypersexual,etc...

It allows for beliefs like how it really isn't that bad for a 30+ woman to have sex with her teenage boy student, because all men want sex all the time or how it is the fault of the sexually active or hypersexual woman who is abused.

I was browsing facebook this morning. I've liked many atheist pages and I was catching up on their shared (and reshared) images and articles. I began to shrug off the bits of sexism I was encountering when it occurred to me: I shouldn't have to. I know these things (list of examples to follow) aren't aggressive or really 'that bad', but they would never occur against men and I'm tired of it becoming commonplace to the point that I don't even notice it sometimes.

Examples off the top of my head:
Page I Fucking Love Science shares an image of men 'doing science' including peeping on alien babes (presumably Martians) and mass cloning more babes. Many women object in the comments object. One, in particular, says she loves the page and often finds the images funny, but asks when the owner will post something that aknoweledges and uplifts females in science rather than objectifying them. Every male to respond to any of these women telss them 'it's just a joke', 'don't be so sensitive' or similar. One man unironically posts that the women upset about this image must not be able to watch tv/movies or listen to radio or read books because this type of thing is everywhere.

Page Pass The 28th Amendment - Complete Removal Of The Church From The State posts an article about the Governor of AZ advocating public bible classes. The page author calls her a 'fat sow'. The following comment is a direct quote from a commenter, ""This cunt needs to get hit by a bus...vile ugly whore."". This one is really interesting to me because:
1. He refers to her as a cunt, the essence of awful femininity.
2. She is ugly and therefore bad.
3. She is a whore. She has sex (which is amoral, for a woman) possibly for money (which is more amoral).

[EDIT: More examples.

Page Sexy Atheists uploads a cartoon of a woman playing computer games facing away from the viewer in just her underwear. A man voices his opinion ('disgusting'. Fair enough, her room is too messy for him.) After more women comment identifying with the post and guessing the game she is playing, based on the interface, he comments again, telling them to play better games if they want to attract a guy. (Full disclosure on this one, I replied:
""This may come as a surprise, but sometimes we aren't trying to impress you. Sometimes we are just sitting in our rooms playing computer games."")

I feel like it's odd because I think most men in the atheist / skeptic / secular community are for womens' rights and believe that women are equal. My working theory is that it's a matter of internalizing society's view on women, chiefly their primary role as decoration and their amoral sexuality.

Sorry I don't have more examples on hand. THe first has been eating at the back of my mind for a week or so and I just read the second. I may add more as I continue to check through posts.

Anyway, as I said, I would love someone else's view on this.",,False,self,t5_2t6l7,1346240170.0,,,True,t3_z0jmg,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/z0jmg/sexism_in_the_atheist_and_skeptic_community/,

(x-post from some other atheist subreddits)",bluestardust,33,2,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/s17do/i_am_looking_for_personal_stories_about_atheist/,"I am working on a journalistic feature piece about atheism in the US, specifically focusing on the discrimination and hardships that many atheists face when coming out (and being out) as an atheist. As I'm sure all of you know, atheists have a very bad reputation in the public- we are baby eaters, hedonists, devil worshippers, etc. Atheists are arguably one of the most hated minority in the US. Many people are not aware of discrimination atheists face, and don’t think it is an issue. Many people do not know how many non-theists exist in this country, and assume they are rare. As David Silverman said in his opening speech at the Reason Rally, we need to “make sure nobody who knows you thinks they don’t know any atheists.”

I want to weave the stories of young (and old) people who have problems coming out as atheist, and problems that a lot face while being “out”. We see these stories so often in rage-comic style or through facebook screenshots, so I know there are some of you out there!
If you are interested, PM me or comment with your story. If possible, I would love to interview you (preferably phone/skype, but I can do email as well).

I am a Ph.D. student studying evolutionary biology, I will provide you with my credentials in a PM if you would like. I am working under the guidance of a writer for a very prominent newspaper. I am not certain where I will be submitting this for publication, but it will likely be either a newspaper or magazine. I would prefer not to broadcast my details over reddit, but I will give you any information you would like in a PM.

Throwaways are welcome, if you aren't comfortable tying your personal information with your reddit account. I can keep you anonymous in the story if you choose. While I would rather attach a name to the stories I tell, I understand that it is tricky, since many don't want to be ""out"" as an atheist. I am not even out to my family completely. I will work with you to make you feel comfortable.

I posted this in [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) a month ago after attending the Reason Rally and becoming inspired for the piece. I was able to obtain a few interviews from that, but would really love more. 

Thanks for your time!

The thing is I don't have a problem with theists. Nearly all of my close friends believe in God and our disagreement has never affected our friendships. But all of my serious boyfriends have been believers, 2 Christians and 1 Muslim, and it's lead to all sorts of problems such as shame about sex, trying to sway me towards their beliefs, weirdness about alcohol, disagreements about gay marriage, awkward conversations about hell. And I don't know if I can deal with that again.

Can it work dating someone who is a theist, religious or not? Does anyone have any success stories, or terrible stories to help me out?

I was very involved in Christianity and even served as a missionary up until three years ago. My ""conversion"" from faith to reason was fast and mostly unpublicized because my family so whole-heartedly supported my actions and were so proud of me. I didn't feel nearly as strange telling my Christian friends that I was an atheist as I did about telling my mom who cried. After that, I didn't tell anyone else and have refrained from saying anything on a public forum like facebook.

However, I just posted an article from FFRF (Freedom from Religion Foundation) on my facebook and had to disagree with a beloved and respected aunt about whether creationism should be taught in schools. I did it as respectfully as I could, but now I'm freaking out! I'm pretty sure I'm overreacting because I'm a grown-up and I am entitled to my own opinions but I have looked up to this woman since before I was potty-trained.

For example, I might find a poll that says religious women are happier than irreligious women.  It doesn't make it true or mean that I agree with the article.  

Part of what I think is important aside from promoting secular humanist women and showing the dangers of religion is to improve debating skills.  Some of the subscribers are college aged and may get to debate religion in classes or for organizations they are members.  The arts of debate and critical thinking are not really taught in school.  Teachers now want to teach to the test.  Even if you find the opinion of the author to be the worst thing in the world, the response should not be, this is not relevant to this subreddit idiot, downvote.  The person posting it may want to know what your counterargument is. That person may not agree with it either. 

I don't support group think. I'm not going to tell you how to think.  I know that the people on here range in opinion on politics and other things as well.  Let's be civil in our debates. Insults do not count as evidence.

1329932232.0,24,self.GodlessWomen,q15e2,Women and birthrights in the UK - a comparison,MaidOfStars,25,1,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/q15e2/women_and_birthrights_in_the_uk_a_comparison/,"Not claiming to speak for all atheist feminist females in the UK, of course! I've been lurking and making the odd comment for a few weeks but have only recently found this subreddit. Of all the things I've read about religion in the States, the implications for women and their birth rights horrify the most - but this is assuming that the headline stories are true. So I thought I'd ask some questions here, maybe to get a better feel for how it is at the ground level. I've presented a few topics and will outline the situation in the UK - this is not intended to make the UK look great or anything, simply to show where I'm coming from.

1. Birth control. Free access for over 16s (age of consent in the UK). Go to your general practitioner (GP) or, after initial prescription, nurse. Get a prescription for pills or follow-up at clinic for implant/etc. Under-16s can access without parental consent if the doctor thinks it appropriate. Condoms can be collected from surgeries and clinics, no questions asked (except to check if you need regular or strong ones). 

2. Emergency contraception. Go to GP and get a free prescription. Alternatively, it can be dispensed by a pharmacist (so doesn't appear on your medical record) for free, but that depends on if the pharmacist has signed up to local health schemes. If you have to pay, it was £23 (maybe $28) about seven years ago. I am pretty sure that under-16s do not require parental consent for this. In fact, it may be accessed through some schools (which have been the target of some religious/family groups). 

3. Termination. Free to access or elect to pay privately. Visit your GP (counts as the first doctor to sign it off), referred to family planning clinic (where a second doctor signs it off). Most common reason cited is ""risk of damage to mental health"" i.e. I don't want a baby. If at either stage, one of these doctors claims a moral objection to termination, they are required by law to have another doctor in the practice see you and sign it off. Appointments take maybe a week or so to come through. Never seen or heard of any picketing outside clinics, although it likely happens. Pro-lifers were banned from demonstrating at my university as their material was deemed to be specifically aimed at causing distress and likely not representative. Under-16s can access termination without parental consent, as long as they can demonstrate they understand what's happening. However, it's fair to say that most will be strongly advised to bring in their parents or guardians. 

As a woman of no obvious religion, at no point have I ever been subject to ethical or religious discussions regarding my choices. This may be different if it a woman is clearly religious (e.g. wearing a crucifix/veil/etc) and seeing a doctor of the same/similar religion.

4. General sex education. At (secular) primary school (7-11 years), I was shown what a condom was (at the age of 11) - we touched one, saw the teacher put one on a banana. I then went to a Catholic high school where sex education was part of biology lessons.

Not exactly from rational thought, but from the heart.",Tennyo_elf,24,0,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/nu9gq/a_different_journey_into_atheism_not_exactly_from/,"Many share their journey into Atheism as one finally coming to use their mind in a more rational, scientific, logical way. For me it was a bit different. I'm not someone who follow herds, but I do admit I'm naive and tend to trust others when I should not. I follow my heart, meaning I tend to follow my emotions (which aren't always rational or logical). 

I grew up Christian, more specifically as a Jehovah Witness. I went to service and believed what they taught me, since I trusted my mother and I trusted those at the congregation. Sadly I always felt different from everyone there. And I tended to use my imagination quite a lot. I hand waved things I thought were strange in the Bible and I always felt bad for liking certain stories when I shouldn't. I loved the idea of magic. I loved the idea of Fantasy stories and Sci-Fi stories and it just felt weird to like them when I was told I shouldn't. In my heart I felt that wasn't right, to not be able to use and indulge in your imagination, but I couldn't rationalize it in my head.

After a while my mother went through I phase which I think was some kind of mental breakdown. She didn't force me to go to church, nor did she make me study the Bible. She instead dragged me all over the country (USA) to run away from 'evil men' who wanted to kill us. I lived in all sorts of homeless and domestic violence shelters for years. But I was free to use my imagination during this time. And I did. I started this huge Star Wars Fan Fiction, read comics, and just generally let myself imagine anything I wanted. Unfortunately I still felt offended when I went to watch certain shows because I still held onto certain beliefs and prejudices. (Such as when I wanted to Buffy the Vampire Slayer but wouldn't after Buffy made fun of JWs...I wouldn't watch the show for years, until this year. Now I feel like I missed out on something wonderful.)

I got older and I started to think more about the Bible. I repressed my sexuality. I tried occasionally to repress my imagination. I tried to live still within the rules of the Bible. And it was killing me. I felt it. But going to college, talking to others, letting myself go with what felt right slowly allowed me to let go of the Bible and the belief in God. I read /r/Atheism and finally understood what I was. And I have never felt more free than before, even when I let my imagination run wild as a teen.

Now, sadly, I'm also antitheist. I feel that religion ruined a good deal of my childhood and life. I understand that theism does help people and I don't want to force anyone to disbelieve when they desperately need to believe. Ultimately, though, I feel that religion is indeed a poison to the minds of humanity, a shackle that also covers up what it truly means to be human. Yet, since I am human I will stay make mistakes. So I will continue to learn to be a better person, and hope that one day I will be more tolerable to theism. 

**TL;DR** My heart and my imagination lead me into Atheism and also into the love of science. So it isn't just your brain that will lead you to renounce your beliefs, it's your heart as well. There is more than one way to Atheism.",,False,self,t5_2t6l7,False,,,True,t3_nu9gq,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/nu9gq/a_different_journey_into_atheism_not_exactly_from/,

The short version is that we were out at a coffeeshop with a friend of ours. Friend mentioned some OMGEPIC pic i haven't seen that was circulating /r/atheism, with all these iconic figures on it, Dawkins, Hitchens, Darwin, etc. ""All the major figures were on there, it was great."" I asked what women were on there. ""Oh... there weren't any.""


I realized *I* can't really think of any big awesome skeptic thinkers who are women, either. Except for Madalyn Murray O'Hair, who I remember people getting up in arms over during my church-going days, and if I remember correctly, she's been dead for almost as long as I've been alive.


I said there's got to be somebody, there have got to be some women at least as good as the guys who keep getting trotted around as thought-leaders in the community. None of us came up with any. I said, well, that makes about as much sense as women within literature/arts/math/etc being missed or ignored. It's not that they aren't there, we just don't know about them.


And this is where the fight started. I said something about how hard it is for women to stick to it through a science program, etc, because of hostile/harrassing environments wearing them down over time. Fiance just plain didn't believe it. Nevermind the way he's seen me get more and more reclusive over time because I can't even LEAVE MY HOUSE without catching hell. Nevermind the fact I've been in work environments where the man/men in charge went quite out of their way to 'put me in my place' verbally, even stated point-blank that this is what they were doing. Nevermind the countless reports, studies, complaints, even an article on this very subreddit that i just read wherein a (actively female friendly) male DJ both addresses the point of dwindling female participation in an atheist conference and also misses it completely (it can't be an actual harrassment problem, it must just be a perception problem). No, it can't be that women get FED UP with this crap over time and just check out of the men's club. Can't be. It's all in her head.


Sigh. Not that I'm still bitter about that little tiff or anything.

Everyday that these religions stay popular and continue to marginalize half of the world, I feel a bit more downtrodden. I'm an atheist because I don't believe, but I'd have a little more hope in the world if Christianity had a Goddess that understood my life perspectives to worship, rather than just a god.

I'm helping somebody start an atheist group on the local university campus, and we have a clubs and organizations fair next week. I'd like to make a nice looking display board and am hoping some of you can help out.

I plan on putting up some definitions for atheist, humanist, agnostic, and so on, and we plan on listing some organizations as well.
I'd also like to showcase some well known people and also put up interesting or inspirational quotes. They don't necessarily have to be about atheism. I like to focus a lot on the wonder of the natural world as well. There are a lot of great quotes from men that are frequently repeated, and I plan on using some, but I'd like to have some women representing secularism as well.

I'm looking for quotes that are more positive. There are at least three Christian groups on campus and I'm not looking to pick fights or anything like that. 

So far, I'm thinking about using this one:

It's a difficult situation for me because my landlady is related to the whole village, and extremely Christian, and I really like my new place except for the quite evil little church problem here.

Basically, the pastor (landlady's brother) is incredibly fucking ignorant and has preached (it's outdoors and I live within earshot) that Jews, Buddhists, Muslims, etc are going to hell because of not accepting Jesus Christ.  Roll eyes, carry on.

Then he starts in with some really horrifyingly homophobic rant.  I had to physically close my windows and go into another room so that I would not run outside and start screaming at him, I was so angry.  (I'm retired military and I am not at all shy about calling people on their bullshit.)

Now for the tricky part - friend (landlady's son) has just told me that he is gay.  He has moved to the city in part to avoid his family, especially his uncle.

Meanwhile, neighbor (landlady's sister-in-law) just will not stop with the invitations to church and prayer meetings, even though I have told her several times that I am an atheist and I am not interested.  Because of the village/landlady situation, there is no avoiding her, since I have to drop off my rent check at her home.

Please tell me some strategies for dealing with this situation - I am really worried that my friend and the pastor are going to get into an explosive argument, or that I will lose my temper with the neighbor, or otherwise somehow stick a foot in it that the whole village will pressure my landlady to evict me.

TL;DR - Homophobic pastor, ultra-fundy neighbors, all related to my landlady = how to cope without being evicted.

 I am, at the moment, and 18 year old pansexual, feminist (and atheist but that's obvious considering where this post is) woman in a committed heretosexual relationship. When I was younger, though I never truly believed in a god, I was a christian.

All my life I have constantly thought of who I will someday marry, what I want my wedding to be like, all of the children I want to have (I want a whole freaking litter of them) and even the career I have chosen for my life is typically female. It almost makes me ashamed to call myself a feminist when my future plans for happiness include a wedding (though now not necessarily to a man), lots of kids, and a career as an elementary school teacher. 

My major is dominated by young christian girls, including all 3 of my roommates. I have made almost no atheistic friends and I often think to myself how easily I could've been captured by religion had I been raised differently or been caught at the right moment. 

I would love to be a housewife were I any good at cooking or cleaning. I love to knit, like sewing okay, and want to learn all sorts of different crafts like candle making, crochet, etc. I love gardening and flowers, cooking and baking, and I have a pretty lovely voice if I do say so myself. I sound like a Disney princess for crying out loud! 

Not to mention I have what everyone I meet calls birthing hips, a petite curvy frame, and delicate, almost childlike feminine features. Looking at myself and comparing my likes and figure to my religious friends, it's almost frightening to see how similar I am to them. I prefer to dress modestly and I am quiet and submissive in all forms. Hell, I'm even a submissive when it comes to kink.

It's unnerving to think of how easily I would fit in with my christian friends, especially my mormon friends if I only believed. 

Edit: Wow all of these responses have made me realize some things. 1. This sub is full of exceptional people who are very understanding and tolerant. 2. There is nothing at all wrong with me being an atheist and friends with a lot of christians nor is there anything wrong with me being a feminist and like stereotypical feminine things. 3. I shouldn't be so disapproving of myself or others simply for interests and beliefs. I'm very glad to be a part of such a great internet community.

This is as close as I've ever gotten. Enjoy!

If I was an Atheist.

If I didn’t believe, would you stone me? If I didn’t obey, disown me?

If I didn’t belong, would you force me? If I just wasn’t sure, coerce me?

If I was just a person, a good one, tell me, would that not be enough?
Would the fact that I doubted, hinder your thoughts? 
Make your eyes stop shining with love?
 
I was baptized as a child, and was taught to be afraid, of my arms, my chest,  my shoulders and my back.
I was told that men were tempted, and that they just could not control. So I had to have the purity they lacked.

I was taught that I was precious, and a chosen daughter of God, but the Bible tells me different, always did.
It says that I’m not worth, the same as husbands, and as sons. Because I’m female, and apparently, a sin.

I cannot have my doubts, They're all just sent by devils red, and I cannot start to think outside the box.
Because we all know that it’s evil, having opinions, knowing facts. And that those that do, undoubtedly are lost.

It taught me that this life I have, is only one of many. That it’s a test that man-kinds’ given from their God.
I’d much rather think, it’s precious, beautiful, sublime! And that right here, right now’s the only one we’ve got

Here is the TAM Code of Conduct that has been printed in the front of this year's conference program:

""We want TAM Las Vegas 2011 to be a welcoming experience for everyone who attends . . .

Please respect your fellow attendees by not disparaging them based on unfair grounds such as race, gender, sexual orientation, and disability; and by not making uninvited sexual comments toward others.

If someone asks you to leave them alone or to otherwise stop a behavior that is directed toward them, please do so. Continued unwanted behavior directed toward another person is harassment. People who harass others or cause multiple complaints of disrespectful behavior may be required to leave without a refund. 

Problems can be reported to TAM staff or volunteers who will bring it to the attention of JREF management. A warning will be given when appropriate, but there will be zero tolerance for violence, physical intimidation, and unwanted intentional physical contact. 

Let’s make TAM fun for everyone!""

What more could we add to this to encourage reporting of sexual harassment? Maybe we can actually help our community instead of getting into this useless ""us vs them"" mudslinging that's been going on for so long now.

One of the most freeing things about leaving religion is the realization that there is no higher power judging you for your actions and waiting to punish you when you do wrong. For me, this is especially true in the realm of sex and relationships. To realize that my own desires are *natural*, not *evil*, and that I am free to express my feelings for my significant other in any way I choose was a fantastic feeling! 

However, my solidly Christian mother does not particularly like this newfound freedom. Ever since she found out that I was sexually active, she frequently finds reasons to comment negatively on my sex life, often calling me ""fast"" and, on one occasion, a slut. Keep in mind that I have only ever had sex with guys with whom I was in committed relationships, which IMO does not warrant such strong judgement. I've tried to explain to her that we just think of sex in different ways and that for me it holds no moral stigma; she just gives me a narrow-eyed look and drops the subject until she finds a future opportunity to comment and insult me once again.

I realize that I'm never going to change her mind and that the best I can hope for is a lack of comment. It just makes me sad that I can't come to my mom, who is one of my best friends, about this. It makes me seriously hesitant to ""come out"" to my parents as an atheist. I would like to think that they would be disappointed but ultimately tolerant of my decision, but situations like this make me think that may not be the case.

I asked why he believed and how he could based on the monstrosities that have been committed in religion/god's name, and his response was that even if religion is wrong, there has to be something out there-- something that started it all. Then, he said that he just thinks that though the evidence is small either way, he just thinks that there is more probability that there is a god than not.

1329859016.0,16,self.GodlessWomen,pzur9,"New to Godless Women, Thought I would Share My Perspective",runblue,18,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/GodlessWomen/comments/pzur9/new_to_godless_women_thought_i_would_share_my/,"For the majority of my life (until around 3 years ago) I was fundamentalist Christian. Most of my experiences with sexism stem from this time period. Roles for women were clearly defined as submissive and sex was prohibited and never talked about except in mostly derogatory ways. All of the adult women were stay at home moms and women were not allowed to teach anything above elementary school. When I found 4chan in college, it was like a breath of fresh air. I had never heard anyone express their basest desires and downfalls so candidly before. This, of course, led me to deconversion and the atheist movement fairly quickly. I became active in the atheist movement on campus, and enjoyed it.

I hear stories about sexism in the atheist movement, and I feel very sad that that happens. However, I feel like most people that talk about the gender gap overlook the most glaring issue: religious demographics. 

According to [PEW](http://www.pewforum.org/The-Stronger-Sex----Spiritually-Speaking.aspx), women are about 10% more religious than men. The problem goes much deeper though. **It is much harder for women to leave church than men.**  Like the post earlier, churches treat women differently. When I deconverted, my pastor found out through facebook and called my parents to excommunicate me through them. Because I was a girl, I was still under the ""head of the household"" aka my dad, who was in charge of my spirituality. I purposefully waited for over a year to come out or be involved publicly because I knew this would happen. **women have a higher risk for leaving the church because their decision is more likely to be more difficult and affect other people very publicly and personally.**

In addition, churches (to the disdain of Driscoll) can be very women-centered even if they are not woman-led. for instance, if you are a female active member of the church you often have volunteer responsibilities such as sunday school teaching, soup kitchen, women's bible study, hospice, etc. Women in marriages or relationships will be strained because the husband might feel failed in his ""spiritual leadership."" When I was a Christian, all of my close friends were made at church. I lost ALL of them.  It was a very hard thing to go through. 

I know that a lot of these issues affect men as well as women, but I can't help but think that many of the absent women in the atheist movement simply haven't deconverted yet or are afraid of coming out to their families. Conditioned to be submissive for years and years, I have found that I am impossibly behind in leadership skills and visibly standing up for my beliefs. Leaving the church is one of the hardest things I ever did.

TL;DR- Sexism in the religious community largely kept me (and possibly many others?) from joining the atheist community more than anything, by way of submitting to the male influences in my life over rational thinking.

Sometimes, though, I get really shaken when a theist makes a ""common sense"" argument for the presence of god(s). As someone raised to be a woman in a Catholic household, I feel like I've been trained to distrust myself. This usually manifests itself in situations involving being hit on by people I don't want to be hit on by (I've had men try to come into my apartment and they try to get my guard down by saying things like ""Aww babe, I wasn't trying to hurt you. How could you think that?"" when I threaten to pepper spray them), or at work, when someone tries to talk me in circles about why they shouldn't have to do it my way when I'm the one in charge of the shift. I think that when theists, especially theists raised to be masculine, try to use ""common sense"" arguments for the presence of god(s), it's playing on that socialization to doubt oneself, and the worst thing for me is that IT WORKS ON ME. It's not like I find myself thinking that there is a god or anything, but it feels like being blindsided, like ""Hmm, maybe since I don't have a convincing argument, or a complete knowledge of the material that I think is a work of fiction, I really can't be certain"" or some bullshit.

I was trying to meet new people, had pretty recently started calling myself an atheist, and really needed to feel like there were people like me around.  It didn't go well.  I found about half a dozen semi-regular atheist groups, and none of them worked out for me.  One of the groups I tried decided, since I showed up and I was the only woman they'd had there in months, to discuss why there were so many more atheist men than women.  The members weren't really interested in what I had to say, and instead had a long conversation about how women aren't really as capable of rational thought and are more easily brainwashed by religion.  At one group I was literally told that I should just sit there and look pretty while the men are talking and then accused of being a humorless feminazi when I didn't take that well.  Several men at different groups accused me of clinging to irrational Christian morality because I wouldn't go home with them afterward.  I gave up after a few months because it was just a bad experience all around.  There were decent people in every group, there just weren't enough of them to offset the number of assholes.

I've often wondered whether this had to do with the location (very conservative town where most atheists were ex-members of a very conservative, patriarchal religion), or the fact that I was showing up to these groups alone in my early 20's and just had no idea how to handle myself, or if my experiences were average for women in atheist groups.

~~~
Backstory:
I was raised in a Fundamentalist Christian Republican home, listening to Rush and ""Dr."" Laura, and sermons on the radio every morning (the ones where if you listen daily you will have read the bible every year). We didn't have cable, I went to Church Camp, the whole nine yards. I was pretty into it; self-identified as a Jesus Freak. I was SO into the whole ""abstinence"" kink and I took it seriously!
My parent's only mistake was the reading they had available around the house; Encyclopedias, Scientific American, National Geographic, even a pretty collection of classical literature with matching leather covers and gold leaf from Socrates to John Locke (I might have been the only one to have actually opened the decorative literature). Suffice it to say that my morals began to diverge from god's especially in college, then I heard about Richard Dawkins via Penn Jillette's Radio Show. I decided to read The God Delusion with the knowledge that I would be forever changed by the end of it, either becoming the cockiest Christian known to mankind, or an Atheist. Well, here I am posting to /r/GodlessWomen 

~~~~
My problem:
Being raised so hardcore Christian, I trained myself out of craving the pleasures of the flesh. I didn't even kiss a boy until I had graduated High School and even though I had ample opportunities, I didn't give up my virginity until I was in my Sophomore year of college. Now I'm an atheist, I'm okay with sex, and have explored it's many wonders and climaxes (thanks to my BF, a former porn shop employee, and Nina Hartely for your guides) but I really think I repressed myself pretty hard in my formative years. I don't anticipate sex, and usually don't get into the mood until physical clitoral stimulus is involved. I absolutely cannot get any enjoyment without a rather large toy which makes outdoor sex a no-go. 
What do I do?
Is this something I should go to a therapist about? A Sex-therapist (are they just phoney creeps?) or a Psychologist? Is there a resource, a place to start for someone like me? Maybe it has nothing to do with my past religious practices and it's just a physiological quirk I've just discovered?

We had a conversation on how appalling the medical care system is for seniors, then we stumbled upon the life-expectancy part of the conversation, how women have a few years more than men, and how senior couples (I've personally known a few) who die within weeks of each other (my theory is the love and bond was strong between them). She replied, verbatim, ""women have a longer life because god intended that they serve the men, and it's just his way to ensure the man is cared for until his death, and the women will die after a few months because they no longer serve a purpose on earth."". 

I couldn't hide the shock when she said that. I asked her about widowed women, and why they live 30 or 40 some-odd years after the untimely death of their partners. She had an ""answer"" for everything. ""Oh, because these women led sinful lives and god intended them to be punished by living without a man to love her, and she may have children to raise."". I had to leave, and felt awful about it, because she's lonely and no one visits her but myself, the only socialization she has is at church (3+ times per week), but I felt that she needed family. I am unwilling to debate with her, because it's like talking to a brick wall, that, and I don't want to cause her any more stress than she's facing right now. She already knows I'm an atheist, and she's not too happy about that, and she continues to pray for my ""salvation"". I've already found salvation, in the form of being free from fear, indoctrination, oppression, and guilt. 

But when she talks about women being there only to serve men, saying that women are totally expendable and useless beyond a husband and children, I can't handle this. I have a daughter, and I will be damned if I ever let her believe this is her only worth.

Any of you experience religious misogyny from a female family member? I know I'm not the only one. I have always thought that women felt oppressed in religion, but I am starting to learn that indoctrination and double-speak, twisted words, can really warp the minds of anyone in a religion believing in this false ""freedom"".

&gt;Along with co-leader Laura Allred, [Lou] Engle has called on women to repent for the nation’s abortions on behalf of America’s women. 

&gt;That's a far cry from the original Esther - a biblical queen who used the power of prayer, fasting, and a ballsy appeal to the king to save the Jews after her stubborn cousin Mordecai nearly got them all massacred.

&gt;One video calls on women who have been ""hurt"" by abortion to come together to ""release the pain"",  a process through which political change will be possible. At face value, Engle seems to be calling on some conservative Christian reconfiguration of girl power - uniting women so they can refine their political voice. 

&gt;Problem is, for these Esthers power is only realized through the humiliation of themselves and their peers.

Most birth controls are ovulation inhibitors meaning they stop an egg from being released. Each month a woman with a natural cycle will ""kill"" an innocent potential human by shedding the life giving uterine lining and the egg with it. By the Republican and religious logic of wanting to protect every potential life in every way possible, birth control should be celebrated for preserving a woman's potential children!

Anyway, here's what happened:

I was checking into a hotel with my boyfriend. We walked in the room and were getting settled when I saw this head under the bed looking up my skirt. I screamed and moved away, and he crawled out. It was a nearly naked old man wearing a ""JESUS SAVES"" shirt with the Jesus fish on it. He was masturbating. I tried calling the police but they wouldn't answer, and when they finally did, they didn't even care!

It was gross. Even though it was a dream, I woke up feeling completely violated and frustrated. 

Just wanted to share. Feel free to dream interpret if you're into that kind of thing.

Fox floods their local and national broadcasts with many stories liken to these stories:

* [Santa brings soldier dad home for Christmas](http://fox59.com/2012/12/19/santa-brings-soldier-dad-home-for-christmas/#9HUfA5mUoiyk5Ljy.99)  and 

* [Santa Claus brings a soldier home to his children](http://www.fox23.com/news/local/story/Santa-Claus-brings-a-soldier-home-to-his-children/2GZ-lzEzwE66or_-CnBmkA.cspx).

I just imagine those same children being told by their Father/Mother's to pray to Jesus to make sure their parent come home safe and sound.  Months go by and the prayers are not answered.  The Christmas season begins and the child asked Santa Clause to bring Daddy/Mommy home .... Poof! Wish Granted!!!

I am Atheist and my SO is Lutheran.  We don't have children, but we do have nephews and nieces that we spoil as much as possible.  I get frustrated at the constant mixture of gifts with tags *From Santa*, encouragement to believe in Santa BUT ""don't forget the meaning of Christmas"".   Decorate the Christmas tree, hand the stockings, put out the cookies and let's go to Mass.  Seriously!???!

I was raise a Jehovah's Witness and have very little memory of celebrating Christmas. So I have always been in the belief that Santa was make believe and as I got older I just continued to disregard all other imaginary beings (easy to do if you are raised a JW).

Santa brings Mommy/Daddy home, brings me presents, eats my cookies, drinks my milk ... and yet you want me to believe in someone I have only seen in pictures?  I always wonder how a child believes in Santa (with all the perks) and then over time realize that Santa is fake while Jesus is real.

* What was your personal experience in believing and not believing in Santa?  
* What it a similar process of believing and not believing in God?  
* Where you shocked to find Santa isn't real?  
* Which took more time to recover the knowledge of non-existence Santa or God?

Thank you for your time in reading this ... it is my personal curiosity.

I have had altercations with this individual on multiple occasions when dealing with the bible. He'll make snide comments on atheistic posts then get offended if you say something on his posts about god. 

Once I posted a Laci Green video about sexism and gender roles. He said he agreed. When I talked about it he said that people shouldn't think that about men but he thinks women shouldn't be wearing that stuff and should wear skirts and that there place is in the home. Then he said he knew a girl who thought that, so it was okay. Whenever I politely disagree he dismisses my logical and well thought out posts as 'just not understanding his point' or 'being illogical and attacking him personally'. 

So apparently only virgins are real women worth any respect. Great. Worst part is we're working on a pokemon spin off together and he's my superior. He refuses to give me any assignments and just goes and tells me to learn the program.
