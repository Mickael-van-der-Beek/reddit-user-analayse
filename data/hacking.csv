Don't be afraid to throw in a few good sites that host tutorials, scripts, or other various tidbits. 

Please provide links and a small description if possible. 

Mine:

- My new favorite Subterfuge (even though I can't get any of the modules other than the default credential harvester to work)

https://code.google.com/p/subterfuge/ - Automated GUI MITM tool

- Macchanger.sh

http://evilzone.org/scripting-languages/mactool-sh-linux-mac-changer/  -  Script that randomly changes your MAC address. I know it's incredibly easy to do it in BT5, but it does it for you. 

- Autocrack3.1.sh 

https://code.google.com/p/autocrack/downloads/detail?name=autocrack3.1.sh  -  script to automatically crack WEP and spits out the key. It automatically moves to the next AP after the first is complete, if you're in an area with multiple AP's. 

- pentest.sh

http://www.phillips321.co.uk/pentest-sh/  -  Automated pentest script made for BT5. Uses various tools such as NMAP, Arpscan, sslclean, etc. Does more than a simple description will do it justice. 

- wifitev2.py

https://code.google.com/p/wifite/ - automated wifi tool. Uses various tools to crack WPA/2 and WEP, including reaver. 

- mergedict.sh 

http://comax.fr/scripts.php  -  awesome dictionary tool! Also check out YAMAS, and the various other scripts at that link! Very useful and fun little scripts. 

- Cookiecadger 

https://www.cookiecadger.com/?page_id=19 - Nice Proof of Concept session hijacking tool. (After installing it in BT5, use the command ""java -jar CookieCadger-0.9.jar -tshark=/usr/local/bin/tshark"" to run it. A lot of people have had issues getting it to open in BT5, and that's the trick!)



So, what do you have to make the rest of our lives easier while we're having fun?




Edit - Also check out http://em3rgency.com/category/scripts/ for a few more scripts, tutorials, and cheat sheets http://em3rgency.com/network-and-security-cheat-sheets/


Edit 2 - Almost forgot about autosploit.pl

Perl script that basically replaces metasploits autopwn. Scans the subnet, tries to find a vulnerability, then tries to exploit it.

/r/programming for instance is clean and full of relevant information. /r/hacking on the other hand only has a handful of posts at most that are remotely interesting. 

In my humble opinion I believe it would best if we could filter out posts in a sensible fashion while they're still in ""new."" While everyone can learn from interesting requests related to hacking, I don't think it benefits anyone to see the same questing asked 100 times a week.

Or so they say.

I have been on high alert recently due to me having done tons of research on things like social engineering and the like recently, and noticed a few things about the Hyatt I'm in right now.

First off, the ATM is plugged in via Cat5, and has no cameras near it. Although it would probably be encrypted, a LAN star would probably do more than enough to grab some data.

Also, I noticed that there were a few receipts in the surrounding area, which I know will display the full name and bank account number. Probably not good.

Another thing I noticed was related to the A/C. Some guy came to fix it and opened it up with 2 hand tightened bolts, then pulled out a modem looking thing. I didn't look any further into that for fear of it setting off some alarm.

Next up was a little social engineering tidbit that I noticed while grabbing my phone from a room that the maids were cleaning. The maids have no idea who is in the room. You could just go to a room they were cleaning, calmly and discretely shove everything in a bag, and walk away. They wouldn't think twice about it until the police were asking them questions.

Last but not least, this place needs to lock down their computers.

First step was to get to command prompt on the ""locked down"" XP setup that is on these computers. Apparently people forget about the windows key and don't bother enabling parental controls to keep me from using everything, including the drive backup service that wipes the disk after any given user is done with the PC.

I also noticed that ""end session"" restarts the computer, and due to the fact that it's a Dell, a little f2 did the trick to get into the bios. Which was also completely open.

Needless to say, I'm talking to you from a linux installation right now. My linux installation. Running off of a flash drive. From the hotel's computers. I am also never trusting a hotel with anything ever again, especially these computers.

**Tl;dr: I could have hacked the entire hotel and probably walked away a few thousand dollars richer, but decided to report everything I found instead**

Have you guys ever found anything interesting in the hacker mindset at a hotel?

EDIT: added a few things
EDIT2: I'm extremely happy that everyone (well, mostly everyone) liked this post. I'll consider doing another one if I notice something like this in the future.

https://github.com/DanMcInerney/wifi-monitor

http://i.imgur.com/dshdm3D.png

This scripts prints all the 802.11 data and control frame packets for all devices on the local network that have sent 1 or more packets. It basically matches an ongoing monitor mode capture, which can sniff every packet in the air including encrypted ones, with a capture from inside the local network. This eliminates all the noise you might see using something like etherape. It helps identify the users on the network as well as seeing which ones are actively surfing.

**MITM script**

https://github.com/DanMcInerney/intercept

http://imgur.com/KaMtLfb.png

This script arp spoofs a target then can show all URLs the target visits, all searches they make on any site, DNS requests made, username/password combos, http POSTs made, can strip SSL via sslstrip, and can catch images they're looking at with driftnet. Besides sslstrip and driftnet all the functionality comes from the scapy python library. Basically I redid what I could from the dsniff suite since the years have taken their toll on it.

Example usage: ./intercept.py -s -u -p -ip 192.168.0.10

* -s: show searches they make
* -u: show URLs visited
* -p: show username/password combos and http POSTs made
* -ip: arpspoof this IP

If not, I apologize.


My ex and I have been off and on for about 3 years now.  He's made it abundantly clear that he does not want to speak with me, yet he hacks into my stuff and then tries to call me out on whatever it is that he finds.  It was just my Facebook to start out but recently he's hacked into my Instagram, Twitter and Email and I believe my iPhone.  He's been leaving comments as me and changing information, I'm assuming to instigate a confrontation from me.  He's called me and has been able to tell me my exact location as well as knowing what pictures I have on my phone and text messages as well, I think.  He lives 600 miles away so he's had no physical access to my iPhone ever.


I cannot figure out HOW he's doing this (which I'm really interested in), if there's a way to stop it or monitor it or something.  Sorry about the wall of text but I figured more information the better.

**/EDIT**

I followed disclosure standards and contacted them with details of the vuln, how it can be used against them and even suggested a fix.

A few emails went back and forth and almost 2 months later they still haven't fixed it. When I inquired as to when they plan to fix it (since I wanted to publish my findings) I was told they will not fix this on the basis of needing to support old clients (even though I know their client's pull new configuration from the server each start up - so this is pretty much bullshit)

You could leave the setup in the vicinity of a wifi network you want to hack, and SSH into the Pi from home so that waiting for a WPA handshake wouldn't be an issue. We soon realized that theft would be a major problem, so we switched the 3G dongle for [a bluetooth adapter](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/super-mini-bluetooth-2-0-adapter-dongle-vista-compatible-11866) and we fit everything into a very subtle case.  
  

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/TJ2fP.jpg) is the end result: a lunchbox with a RaspberryPi running [PwnPi](http://www.pwnpi.com/), powered by a [usb battery](http://www.dealextreme.com/p/9000mah-mobile-external-battery-power-charger-with-cell-phone-adapters-black-silver-54978?item=86). It's running a script that automatically connects to our iPhones via bluetooth (getting that to work took a long time..), so we can just SSH to the Pi and run airmon-ng. The usb hub you see is necessary because the Pi can only provide about 100mA to its usb ports, so we put a hub between the battery and the Pi and use a usb Y cord to connect the [wifi adapter](http://www.ebay.com/itm/290501740266?ru=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_sacat%3D0%26_nkw%3D290501740266%26_rdc%3D1) to both the usb port on the Pi and the hub, so it can get its power directly from the battery.

* No asking for codez/warez/0days etc
* ask anything related to ""hacking""/exploitation/exploration, i am more adept at kernel shit and memory stuff.

GOGOGO. 

p.s. if you have any problems with your OS, Install Gentoo.

I own and have read all of these books, so I can vouch for their quality. They have been indispensable for my professional education and experience. With 6-12 months of dedication and free time, I promise you will have a very solid understanding of the theory, history and practices of: hacking, social engineering and penetration testing. Some of them get very technical, especially The Art of Exploitation, but the 3 books by Kevin Mitnick (my friggin' hero) are very interesting and exciting.

I used to go to the eff's website and see that little banner pop up, ""Learn about threats to coder's rights"" I had assumed that because the country I lived in was Murica, nothing would harm people's rights to their code, we have an economy based on innovation and a press based on free speech, all of this will iron out in a few months.

How naive was I, since then the AT&amp;T attacks occured, I thought ""Well this is just like Back Orifice, he did what he did to highlight the problem, they'll never choose to prosecute...  Okay, they'll never get a conviction... This can't be happening.""

Then the Snowden inciedent broke, ""Well it's time to open the floodgates, the public reaction is gonna be massive, oh will there be hell to pay at the NSA...  Why are all the news chanells talking about Snowden, instead of the stuff he leaked?""

""How can they prosecute him, all he did was release some docs to the media?""

What happened, all you see today is people being prosecuted for exercising their rights, strung up on trial and crucified to make an example, all because they did what they did with a keyboard.  I don't know what or who to believe anymore, and I write this wondering how many watchlists will I be put on, how many watchlists **am** I on?  


The tools I once thought would enrich our lives are being used to keep tabs on us, those of us who dare to question are placed under watch, labeled suspicious persons and their browsing tracked, and yet the public does nothing.

My god, I was going to major in Computer Science.

Just recently a man was imprisoned because he thought his employers were violating the GNU-GPL by not releasing their changes, so he intended to do it himself, legality aside he tried to stick to his ethical senses and was imprisoned for it, is that the field I want to put bread on the table with?  Can I with all of this going on?  If I write code for pen-testing, how long before they arrest me as an accessory, how long before testing my own code is considered running a cyber weapon?

There was a link posted ~3 months ago, however that never really saw traction, so I figured I'd post about it again.

The basic premise, as interpreted so far, is that each team will begin with a server and have to capture/hold other teams' servers, along with their own. Lose your base server and you're out of the game. Reports have it that Gibson will not be taking part in contributing hardware, so we'll be unable to hack it. ;)

Several months ago she broke up with this creepster and now she is in a different state.  Recently he has taken up harassing her and unnerving her by quoting some of her recent emails back to her.  

Since this has begun she has changed all of her account passwords.  Apparently this has not prevented him from being able to read her recent emails composed after the passwords have been changed.  

I suggested to her that he had possible installed a key logger on her computer when they were together.  I don't know much about macs so I told her to change every account password using her phone while I googled some stuff about macs and key loggers.  

It looks like installing Tripwire might be a good way to detect if there is in fact a key logger running.  

Little Snitch 3 prevents any outgoing connections from occurring in the background, requiring user permission for each one.  I can see that getting annoying, but if there is a scheduled upload it should be visible, right?  

Is there anything else we should try?  Am I barking up the wrong tree by assuming it's a key logger in the first place?  I appreciate any assistance and I will update here as things develop.

There are these SDR receivers you can get for like ten dollars from china. That let you listen to anything from 25-1700MHz.

The built in antenna isn't too great for weak signals, but it's fine for close range stuff, within a few miles.

Here's a quick list of things you can do with it. (legality may vary)

* Reading pager messages
* Listening to cordless phones (900MHz ISM)
* Watching 900MHz security cams
* Garage door openers, remote weather sensors, smart meters, satellites, plane tracking, ship tracking

Then the traditional signals:

* Public service, fire, EMS, police
* Ham radio
* CB radio
* FRS and GMRS radio (walkie talkies)
* FM Radio
* ISS Slow Scan TV
* beacons
* and so many other things

There's a whole new area of learning for you traditional hackers. Things like GFSK MFSK, PSK, ASK, ODFM all sorts of modulations.
You can take snippets of digital sound, open them in audacity, and decode the bits of data and read the raw data. Then you can craft your own data with the HackRF.

example: 

If you have a walkie talkie you can simply set the SDR to 400MHz and watch the signal as you speak into the handheld.
You can send pictures and data over audio like dialup and have the PC decode it.

Software is available for Mac Linux and PC.

It's a really cool idea, a very new technology, and I would be happy to answer questions.

Also

It's receive only, but there is hardware in the works for transmitting. It's called the HackRF Jawbreaker, a project sponsored by DARPA. Should cost around 300 dollars. Still a great deal seeing that most SDR's cost from hundreds of dollars to thousands

1359329488.0,40,self.hacking,17e7p9,Help! I've been locked out of my favorite audio editing software!,jdrake90,47,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/17e7p9/help_ive_been_locked_out_of_my_favorite_audio/,"Hi Hacking, really hoping someone can help me. The most I know about programming/hacking is a wee bit of HTML, and that's it. Thanks in advance for any replies or advice.

I'm a professional podcaster, voice over artist, and former radio host, and I do all of my own audio editing on my Mac. In 2010, I paid over $150 for a tiny little piece of software called Bias Soundsoap, which in my opinion, is the best standalone noise removal software available. I've been using SoundSoap ever since, and it's helped me create pristine podcasts and VO audio.

Sometime in the past three years, Bias, the company that makes SoundSoap, went out of business (not sure why). This didn't bother me until I recently upgrade my computer, was asked (by SoundSoap) to re-register to the new machine using my product key, and then discovered their authentication server is completely gone. 

So now, I'm stuck with software I paid for, love, and can't use at all. I'm locked out:( 

I've scoured the web looking for keygens, cracks, or anything that will help me bypass the stupid registration process... but since this is such niche software (unlike Photoshop), there isn't really anything available.

Can anyone help me crack this sucker? 

BTW, I know that when you google the software, you'll find product pages from Avid - Roxio - etc. But a) I'm reluctant to spend another $99 since I already own a product key and b) I'm 80% sure the issue is that the authentication server is just no longer in operation. 

Here are the relevant links: 
What is left of the Bias site (I have SoundSoap 2.4): http://www.bias-inc.com/downloads/updates/
The Bias FAQ Page: http://www.bias-inc.com/support/faq/index.php#a5
Here is a public dropbox folder (that I created) containing SoundSoap 2 - and then the 2.4 update: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n4p8lt7wluc7she/fUwQsBu0Uw

Thanks so much!

PS. I'd be happy to do some free VO work for anyone who can help me... think radio announcer voice mail greeting... or something for your business/website. Here is an example of a recent video I did VO for: http://youtu.be/_mEO9s88Af0?t=2m16s

Allow me to stop right here and say that I am not here to ask how to crack into someone's computer, steal personal information, or any other stupid shit like that. All I want to do is learn the most basic skill all hackers possess: programming.

Ive read up a bit on the subject (namely [this article](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#believe1) which I have so far found to be very well-written), and it appears that a good place for a person like myself to start is to install and begin using Linux or Unix. However, I am on a Windows-operated PC, and from what I've read, Windows and Linux dont get along very well. 

The approach that seems to be highest recommended by individuals with knowledge on the subject is installing a virtual machine, and running Linux within that. 

So, I would like to know: considering my level of knowledge on the subject (slim to none, but enthusiastic to learn), and my current operating system, is using a VM my best approach? And consequently, which VM in particular should I use? 

Thank you all for any help you can provide.

**EDIT**

Many, many thanks to all of you who replied. The amount of information you've all laid out for me has been both encouraging and highly motivating, albeit a little intimidating. But I like the challenge.

For those who read my comments about completely fucking my computer within 2 hours of trying to learn the most basic of basic skills you all most likely posses, I appreciate your replies and attempts to help. However, it appears I am more reliant on the crutch named ""Windows"" than I thought, and I had no idea how to follow through with some of the solutions you provided. So, I swallowed my pride and ""repaired"" windows, losing every last file I had in the process. Thankfully, some of the more important ones were stored on that external HDD, so not all is lost.

Needless to say, my goal by the end of this week is to be operating on a Linux system.

As a bit of an update, I've found a couple of incredible courses on Python and I've been powering through it, loving everything new I'm learning. A lot of you mentioned that a comprehensive knowledge of networking is also very important, so ill be researching that quite a but as well, starting with the sources supplied in this thread.

As a final note, I would just like to mention how much I appreciate the overwhelming amount of support and advice you have provided. This is one of few subs that has not cast me into karma-oblivion for asking simple, yet honest questions, and it is such a breath of fresh air.

I look forward to learning and understanding more on this subject, and I'm now one more subscriber to this sub.

How do they detect this? Only way I can think of is they have a list of IP addresses associated with the Tor network and if it sees one then they deny image uploads. I might be wrong through, or maybe they use a method I haven't thought of. Any ideas how else it might happen?

Equally importantly - why would imgur care? I can understand a website like eBay, Amazon, a banking website, or any website dealing with money. But not imgur.

Discuss.

**EDIT: The consensus seems to be that the only way Tor can be detected is by having a list of IP addresses that are associated with the network. Then the server you are connecting to has to check the list and if it finds a match then it knows the incoming connection is using Tor, and handles it accordingly. No information about your real IP or identity is compromised but it can still be seen that you are using the network.

I've ticketed Twitter to get it taken down, but no avail yet.

 I believe the email used to create the account is anonymous_john_smith@aol.com. Any advice?

EDIT: Due to large amounts of flame directed at the account, he's deleted the pictures, however I think multiple people have screencapped them for proof.

For a school project I have to modify a usb stick so when it is plugged in, it does something ""malicious.""  I was thinking of doing this on Windows 8 or Ubuntu 11.04 since I have them readily available, but there are no OS restrictions

I was thinking of using GRUB to steal ssh keys to the usb stick since they are usually saved in the same directory on Ubuntu.  However, I can't enumerate directories with GRUB, so as far as I can tell, this won't work unless I hardcode a username.  Am I wrong on this?

My other thought was to install a malicious executable with the GRUB install command.  It would need to automatically run, but could do something as simple as create a pop-up notification to demonstrate that I could have executed arbitrary code.  I am not sure how would make something run itself after boot.

I really don't have any experience with bootloaders.  Can anyone lend me insight as to whether these ideas are feasible?

The usual teenage drama shit stirring, she is slut, he fucked her, he smokes weed, etc. 

Now, there are other kids at school threatening to beat up this unknown person when they find out, which eventually they will, kids talk. Also, in today's age, there is a real threat of kids bringing weapons and making there own justice. 

Now I work for local government IT, so I sent an email to principal stating if he needed my help to let me know as our sheriff department has successfully tracked down people by IP working with Blizzard / Comcast / etc. 

The principal responded back that the state police and local prosecutor are ""looking"" into it, but if I have the ability to find out who this fake account is, it would be helpful. By asking me, I am not convinced he really did contact state police or prosecutor.

My concern is that the school is in a small town, and I know how ""motivated"" and IT educated local law enforcement can be. I am gonna talk to my detectives and see if they can get some info. Without an active case, companies may not release info, but you would be surprised how much info they will release to law enforcement without much of a fight. 

Of course the account could be reported to twitter and it would be shutdown, but that would not stop the person from creating another account. 

I was thinking of running a spoofed twitter site to grab credentials of user,  which would allow me to log in as them, giving me email of user and last IP logged in from, which would be easy to track down from there.

Is that legal for me to do my own ""vigilante justice""? I would only disclose the info to the principal and let him do what he wants with the data. Our sheriff's department was ""unclear"" and had some OK's and some Not-OK's.

Thoughts?

**UPDATE:** I decided NOT to capture credentials, as I can see that being an issue. I did setup a listening service that when user clicks, it reports IP address. So, all I have is a log of IP addresses accessing my fake twitter site with timestamps. 

I gathered around 30 unique IP's. I know the fake account clicked the link and accessed the bogus site as they tweeted my fake account with ""fuck you, a twitter account? Really?""

I came home to match up the timestamps exactly to know which one, but twitter has suspended the account so I can no longer see the timestamp of their reply. I assume users reported account to twitter as bad and they suspended account. Not sure if LE is investigating or just shutdown account. Maybe that will scare the user to quit. 

I just have a general timeframe of access of site, which narrows the list down to a possible 4 IP's. 

The principal did reply to my email, stated that he reported to state police and local prosecutor, and asked if I could find out who it is, it would be helpful. 

I plan on giving the list of IP's to principal and inform him to pass along to prosecutor. If they decide to use it great, if not, oh well. ",,False,,t5_2qhva,1337138308.0,,,True,t3_to6sa,http://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/to6sa/vigilante_hacking_legal/,

He says that he was on the White House home page when the redirection occurred. A friend of his chimes in claiming that he had just been redirected from the ""About the NSA"" page at NSA(.)gov to our conversation. He then says it happened again, and this 2nd time he was redirected to the FB page of someone named Megan. Megans last post (from 2012) just so happens to be a picture of 2 children in front of a Coca Cola truck. I asked him to substantiate his claims with browser history but he cannot (as he's using wii u).

This is either unraveling or getting more interesting. It seems it's just these 2 kids trolling peoples accounts to make it seem like Anonymous hackers are redirecting people from government sites

I had varying levels of success with it. I had a gateway 10.0.0.1, my host 10.0.0.3, my virtual machine 10.0.0.17, an android phone 10.0.0.7, and a second computer 10.0.0.8. When I passed the command

    arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.7

and ran driftnet, this gave me the desired result without impacting my network performance in any significant way. However, when I reversed it to 

    arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.0.0.7 10.0.0.1

the network slowed down to a crawl, where most requests for websites were timing out. Is there a way to work around this issue? Also, would there be a way to use the target flag on my gateway but instead of using 10.0.0.7 as my host use all machines on my subnet, short of starting a separate arpspoof for each of them?

Also, it is unclear to me why routing traffic one way affects network performance so greatly, but routing it the other way does not. It seems symmetric in the sense that no matter which direction you go you have to pass through my gentoo box.

Anyway, these are the questions of a noob. Thanks.

**Edit**: I also just noticed that when I spoof it one way as indicated in my post with the command

    arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.7

driftnet worked as expected, when my host was my android phone. Trying it on my second vista computer

My hardware is not great (dual core i3 laptop, 2 gigs ddr2 ram), but I'm still interested on learning as much as I can as hands on as I can.

So my questions are these:

Along side with tutorial videos, forums, etc, are there any relatively cheap pieces of hardware or extra steps I can take to create a practice environment for hardware penetration as well as things like wifi, server, site, and database penetration?

Why?",LYH329,25,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/140v1a/wifi_sniffing_with_2_cards_one_captures_all/,"**Software**: I'm using Backtrack 5 r3 and Backbox 3 in VMware Player and VirtualBox (tried all combinations), host OS is Win7 on a laptop. **Hardware**: First card is TP-Link TL-WN722N, second one is Alfa AWUS036H. 

I have created monitor mode interfaces for both cards (airmon-ng), both are set to the channel of my open AP. My host OS is connected to the open AP using the laptop's built in antenna. Both external antennas are placed between laptop and AP.

Now I access a web page on my laptop while either airodump-ng or Wireshark are capturing traffic on one of the monitoring interfaces. 

According to Wireshark with the http filter applied, the TP-Link captures the entire http communication (requests, responses, HTML, etc.) while the Alfa does not. 

With the Alfa, instead of most requests and responses, Wireshark displays ""**[TCP Previous segment not captured] Continuation or non-HTTP traffic**"". The Alfa seems to be missing much, as illustrated by this Wireshark screenshot: http://www.abload.de/img/cmp0yddj.png (mon0 is TP-Link, mon1 is Alfa).

Any ideas why or what I might check/try? It doesn't make any difference if I'm using only one card at a time; the Alfa still doesn't capture everything. Actually, that's why I connected the TP-Link in the first place.

Kosova Hacker's Security group today release very sensitive server info of ""The National Weather Service"", which was gathered due to a ""Local file inclusion"" Vulnerability in weather.gov .

By definition, Local File Inclusion (also known as LFI) is the process of including files on a server through the web browser. This vulnerability occurs when a page include is not properly sanitized, and allows directory traversal characters to be injected.

Hackers published complete data in a pastebin file uploaded today, but the hack was performed two days back and in meantime, server administrators fix the vulnerability.

We just talked with the hacking crew to know the reason of hack and data exposure, one of them explain that they are against US policies, who are targeting muslim countries. ""They hack our nuclear plants using STUXNET and FLAME like malware, they are bombing us 24*7, we can't sit silent - hack to payback them""

Hackers exposed data from sensitive files :
/etc/passwd
/etc/groups
/etc/hosts
/etc/samba/dhcp.conf
/etc/apache2/conf.d
/proc/version
/proc/cpuinfo
/proc/self/mounts
/proc/self/status
/proc/self/stat
/etc/security/access.conf
/etc/ldap/ldap.conf 
/etc/cups/printers.conf 
/etc/gconf
/etc/syslog.conf 
/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf 
/share/snmp/snmpd.conf 
/etc/ca-certificates.conf 
/etc/mysql/conf.d 
/etc/security/limits.conf
/etc/security/group.conf

For a server administrator this information is very sensitive, whereas for a Hacker this information could be too much juicy like members of /bin/bash shell are root, cmccan, darnold, mstrydom, nscanner who can login via console. That means, hackers can try to brute force there usernames against password list to compromise the server.

In their note hackers wrote, ""Months ago in the American media write that as Americans have in the field control cybernetics Muslim country servers. We as an organization have taken the order we receive checks in some American servers as it is one of to Weather.Gov. We do not want Americans to take control servers Muslim country .We have infected computers with botnets very few organizations that deal with anti-Muslim purposes. We will soon publish the many other things the U.S. government and we will never stop year after year . This is our mission .""

I got a phone call from my cousin who owns a business, he said one of their pc's started acting strange and they rebooted it, upon logging back in to the windows 7 machine, a purple box popped up saying ""I'm dying Jardy Jim"" and his name is Jardin. The box disappeared fairly quickly. It's kinda freaked him out needless to say. 

The office setup is very simple it's just 2 PC's on a home group no server or anything, all generic software like avast antivirus and windows firewall enabled.

I can't get there to look at it for a while and was just wondering if anyone can recommend any software to help with intrusion or even to track who may have done it.

EDIT 2: Through some research, the wmsoft file appears to be a trojan horse that was going to be downloaded.  I had VNC up, and TIL about the insecurity of it.  A bot accessed my computer through VNC, typed in the key combination for the run dialog, pasted that above string in, and hoped to get the trojan on my computer.  Fortunately, the firewall blocked it explaining why the hacker didn't simply press the ""allow connection"" button on the dialog that came up.

I recently came across a pair of spare hard drives I had forgotten about-one 40 gig, one 200 gig. I've wanted to learn how to hack things and came up with an idea-I have two computers in the house, one my wife's and one mine, so I could easily install backtrack onto one and dual-boot linux and windows onto the other to practice hacking on my own time. But as a n00b looking to be something better, I have a few questions for you hacker vets out there. Namely:

1.) Should I install older OS's and get used to older, more basic exploits or just try XP and ubuntu now? I read on r/hacking that the best way to get started was to start derping around with cracking tools, but I heard from someone else that modern OS's were fairly secure. Is an up-to-date system to much for a beginner to learn from?

2.) I hate backtrack because it makes me feel stupid. Is there a place where I can get one big tutorial on using the thing? I found the backtrack wiki, that seems pretty good, but is there anywhere else I can find good info? It seems like everyone and their dog has written a tutorial on doing something specific with backtrack, but does anyone have a tutorial they like that isn't already on the backtrack website?

I'm sure I sound stupid, (I ought to, I'm not sure what I'm doing and I'm trying to learn) but I'd appreciate any feedback anyone has to offer that would make the learning process easier.

edit: Forgot to mention, in case anyone brings up the obvious ""Y U NO USE VM!?"", it's because I have tried VM's and my computer is to slow to simply run them with 512 mb of ram. I tried the linux security dojo VM, and it was so slow it took me several minutes to start it up and then shut it down. I can't imagine it would do better with two VM's running.",,False,,t5_2qhva,True,,,True,t3_jevyd,http://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/jevyd/which_os_to_hack_to_learn_hacking/,

I'm a plucky young science journalist who is currently holding on to ""an idea without a story"". Basically, my beat this semester is consumer tech, and I met [a really cool hacker](http://ids.cs.columbia.edu/users/ang) and was like, woah, I should write a story about *that*. Problem is, two weeks and several hours of research later, I realize that I know even less about the subject than I previously thought, and have no idea what a good starting point might be. 

So really, what's the story you'd like to see written? 

Some background: Yeah, I know nothing about the field, but I've also gone into news stories on particle physics knowing nothing and done a bang up job. I just need some direction.

I'm NYC based and any places I could visit or people I could interview in person (just tell me who/where, and I'll take care of getting them to talk to me) would be beneficial. 

It's a 1,000 word feature, which means indepth but not that indepth. If I had 5,000 words, I could just muck around with everything, but as it stands I need to find a hook. 

Any and all definitions of hacking are fair game. Part of the problem is that I went in with a stupidly small idea of what hacking is. Broaden my mind, rock my world, etc. 

Thanks internet. 

Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions! I'd been looking into hackerspaces in the city before posting, and I think I'm going with a look at what they do and how the word ""hacker"" is changing/misconceived, etc. Any thoughts on that?

I am probably being very paranoid and crazy but hear my out first.

To start of I'll say this. I download my media, sometimes legally but more often, illegally. 

Now if my paranoia has some truth to it would to be considered dumb to ""confess"" to my downloading on this here forum. 

I would however like to think that i have planned ahead and am currently using an encrypted VPN tunnel. 



----------------------------------
The reason for my paranoia:

A couple of months ago I ordered an upgrade from my ISP to get a faster DSL connection. Sweet. 
The thing is nothing happened for a long time so I contacted their customer support and they told me that they had to upgrade some hardware on the local switching station. I could understand that so I waited some more. 
Another month or so passed and, nothing. Not even a new modem was sent to me as they had promised. 
At that moment something else had happened. I play a lot of Xbox live. I know.. I'm sorry. 
However, my ping had increased dramatically. I could not even get a game going sometimes. 

I called my ISP and told them about my problem and they then told me the following. 
That there was a bug in their system and that that was the reason I hadn't got the upgrade yet and that the lousy ping was because of my firewall settings, which I know is the same bullshit they always throw at customers in order to get rid of them. My network has always been working excellent and I have never had a firewall problem that I couldn't solve on my own. 

Now. 

I feel that there could be more to this than I know. There has been a small boom in Sweden with people getting charged and convicted of file sharing and I do not want to be a part of that statistic. 

My question is this. 

Is there any way for my to find out if there has been any ""snooping"" on my network, and if so, could I possibly ""plug"" that hole?

I know that I could just lay low and stop the downloading if I don't want to get caught but that't the kind of advice I could do without. 

Thanks for reading.

My professor, of course, has some experience with such systems (and I'm not unfamiliar with them myself--I run Ubuntu and I'm pretty good with vim). So the guy starts talking.

Apparently he's an amateur computer security enthusiast hoping to go professional, he taught himself C and C++, and he's been getting into penetration testing. As such, he had installed Backtrack Linux on one of his machines, and he suspected that the OS itself was compromised. Not long after installing it, his computer got rooted. Not only rooted, but it took over the BIOS such that he couldn't flash them to get control back--it would re-flash the BIOS. In addition, he said it took over all operating systems on a machine, even those not actively running. He said that commands had been rewritten so that, if he tried to format the drive, it would instead send all of his files to a remote server somewhere. Moreover, if he tried moving the hard drive to another computer, it would take over that machine just as completely. And, he said, if he put in a CD for a pre-98 Windows version (he had tried back to *3.1*, he said), it would flash the BIOS so that it didn't recognize the CD drive; with newer Windows versions, it...did something else to prevent him from regaining control (he was talking a mile a minute, so I can't remember exactly what he said it did). He also said that they had stolen his identity and wiped out his card completely.

Ok, so far, just a garden-variety malware story, if one about an impressive malware, right? But here's where it gets scary (or at least, we thought so): he said whatever it was got into ALL of the machines on his building--Windows, Linux, and Mac. It got through his router, which had not only the hardware firewall but an IP tables firewall behind it, and took over all other machines on the network. Plus, apparently Backtrack has GSM-cracking tools on it, and his girlfriend's phone was, he said, now sending ""weird data packets."" And to top it all off, he said a normal user wouldn't have noticed; he only caught it by noticing an unusually large amount of network traffic going on behind the scenes.

Not knowing who to talk to, he had talked to the PC manufacturers, who merely asked if he had had anti-virus software installed, then to the police, who didn't have anyone that knew anything about unix or linux. In desperation he came to our college's Computer Science department.

My professor told him it was beyond his pay grade (he doesn't know much about hacking either), and that either a nearby state university with a good CS program, top computer security consulting firms, or the FBI were his best bets. So, /r/hacking, what do you guys think?

EDIT: Thank you all for your responses! I must admit, I know basically nothing about this subject; it's something I've always been curious about, but I've never had the time to pursue it.

Based on the responses you've all given here, as well as a few bits of information I seem to have left out, I've concluded that the story is mostly accurate in terms of what it happened to his machines, but a few parts were blown out of proportion, either by his paranoia (which is understandable, considering that he apparently had his identity stolen) or by my own lack of knowledge of the subject. He did mention that ""they got in through SSH,"" suggesting that he was the target of an attack. The claim that the OS itself was compromised seems unlikely, unless he downloaded it from a third party (which didn't seem to be the case), so that's probably his paranoia coming out. He mentioned that he thought one of the tools he downloaded was also infected, so in thinking about it, I'd guess that that tool probably contained a simple keylogging trojan that got his root password (which I'm guessing he used on all of his machines/installations) and allowed a hacker to get into his system(s). Come to think of it, he's exactly the kind of person one would expect to be snared by such a tactic. Sucks for him, though.

Once again, thanks to everyone who offered an opinion.

The one thing I've devoted myself to is making sure this isn't cheesy or boring and that the tools and skills depicted in my story are as realistic as possible. Just to get the feeling I've been writing the whole thing in Linux whenever possible.

That being said I've gotten myself into a weird pickle and was wondering if anyone would be able to help me out. I've got my main character in possession of a .pdf, a dossier of important intel that's been compiled by an unknown party. If there is one, what is the most realistic way for him to be able to track down the creator of the file?

EDIT:
Man, I wasn't expecting such awesome help so quickly!
If anyone is interested I'd like to have someone go through the whole thing when I'm finished with my rewrite at the end of this week and tell me if there's anything embarrassingly wrong or unrealistic in it. If anyone is interested, let me know.

What if we took one of those pictures from every single user on facebook, and make a collage out of it, kinda like [this one](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sj-collage.jpg).  Would be pretty cool, right?  Well, lets do it then.

I started the project yesterday, finished the code to scrape the pictures off today, and in the last hour I managed to download about 100,000 of them.  They average 2.5 kb in case anyone was wondering, 50x50 pixels.  By the time I'm done, I'll have about 1.4 TB worth of these pictures, 600 million of them.  Then after I paste them all together, we're looking at a collage that's about 1.4 tera-pixels, around 1,200,000x1,200,000.  My only concern is that facebook will catch on and start asking for CAPTCHAs.  Lets hope not!

Feel free to ask any questions, or make some suggestions on how I can make this go as smoothly as possible.  Thanks!

In fact if you work in an IT field this is probably well known, but nonetheless:

Anyone at all can hack into the admin account of almost any given Apple computer running OS X. I discovered this in 8th grade when I googled ""How to hack Mac OSX"" because I was curious. If you want to read an article that explains this in detail, here:
http://www.hackmac.org/hacks/how-to-create-a-new-administrator-account/

But, really it boils down to 4 steps:
- Reboot the computer and hold Command-S to get booted into a command line.
- Type EXACTLY ""/sbin/mount -uw /"" and press enter.
- Type EXACTLY ""rm /var/db/.applesetupdone"" and press enter.

Once the computer starts up again, it will ask you to create an admin account. From your new admin account, you can delete the password from the other admin account, and then access it.

I know so little about hacking I probably don't even deserve to be subscribed here, but here I am. I got this phishing email that appears to collect user/pass/domain info before dumping to google. It doesn't look well written (`img src=""file:///C|/Users/Oracle/Desktop/spacer.jpg""`) so I'm sure there's something you guys can do with this to have fun.

I tried the very few SQL injections I know of and couldn't get it to do anything so if you manage to break it I'd love to know how.

Edit: oh, no. I browsed to the root of the domain that took me to a bank. They seem like they're having all sorts of problems.

* VMWare
* Multiple routers, switches, wireless APs
* Almost everything :D

I've been wanting to get the OSCP for a while, so I was thinking about doing this in the downtime I have now. As some of you may see from some of my other posts, I am not incredibly familiar with networking, though after about 8 hours of reading and screwing around with nmap last night, I think I am a lot closer to understanding the OSI model than I was before. 

So anyway - what level of understanding in what subjects would you recommend before starting the OSCP coursework? I have their syllabus, so I can see what subjects will be covered (I have a liveboot of BackTrack 5 right now, and I have been using some of the tools on my host OS, mostly MSF, nmap, netcat and while I got Wireshark to build from source last night, I haven't actually gotten around to using it yet). A little background on me - I have 3 semesters of CS classes behind me, I can program in Java and Python, and I've done software testing before. 

So, from those of you who know about this program, what do you think I should do?

The only thing worth mentioning that I won't fix right now is that the site is on shared hosting.

I'm not quite sure of the mechanism behind how aircrack-ng cracks these encryption, since, in the end, I'm really just following a procedure mechanically. 
  
**My question**: Is there another way that I don't know of? Is there a way I could design a new way?
  
Is it possible to hack a WPA network using a rouge AP, in the sense that you ""impersonate"" the target AP and get the authenticating clients to ""sent"" you the encryption when they try to connect?
  
Another question stems from my background. I do research in the field of estimation and uncertainty, which deals a lot with probability, in this field we have a method called ""simulated annealing"", the premise is similar to Battleship: You guess your first ""move"" or ""choice"" until you get the best ""fit"" for that first choice, then you move on to the second choice and, based on the result of the last choice, you make new choices. In battleship, you first guess until you find a ship, then you circle around that point to sink it. **With regard to WPA**, could you guess part of the pass phrase or the encryption, verify that they are correct, then continue guessing?

I recently developed and published an open-source Static Code Analysis tool, and I want to share it here. I call it ""Watchtower"":

[https://github.com/chrisallenlane/watchtower](https://github.com/chrisallenlane/watchtower)

The upshot is that it's a more feature-complete tool than `grep` for finding potentially dangerous code within an application. It's thus useful for code reviews (spotting SQL injection vulnerabilities via sloppy use of `$_GET`, etc.), and also for incident response, at least within the web context (as in, ""where did that hacker slip an `eval(base64_decode(` into my application?""). It's also language-agnostic, and very extensible.

I bring it to your attention for two reasons:

1. I want to see this thing used
2. I'm looking for contributors whose expertise can make up for some gaps in my own

Any and all feedback is appreciated, as are bug reports, feature requests, etc.

Now i keep saying ""hacked"" because i have NO idea what it really means and have no experience.

          Attack was unsuccessful. Possible reasons:

              * Perhaps MAC address filtering is enabled.
              * Check that the BSSID (-a option) is correct.
              * Try to change the number of packets (-o option).
              * The driver/card doesn't support injection.
              * This attack sometimes fails against some APs.
              * The card is not on the same channel as the AP.
              * You're too far from the AP. Get closer, or lower

Onto my problem:  I have Kali recognizing my wireless USB adapter.  lsusb shows the atheros  AR9271 device.  

When I check dmesg|grep ath9k I get the following :

usb 1-1: ath9k_htc: USB layer deinitialized

basically ends in driver unloaded and usbcore:registered new interface driver ath9k_htc.

Looks as if the driver is bad or needs to be reloaded, but I'm unsure how that is done as I'm sure you have to compile and decompile the driver.

He has long suspected his neighbors of the burglary but nothing was ever proven. His SSID Ida's the same now as it was when he had the Wii and his network is encrypted with the same key. This leads him to think the neighbor has the Wii and lacks the intelligence to change the network settings in it. The question is do you know of anyway to trace back based on the wireless where this Wii is located. I could think of none but I may be wrong. Another idea was to match the MAC address of his Wii to the one on his network but the MAC address couldn't be found listed anywhere in Nintendo's paperwork for the Wii so assuming it is only available via the system settings in the Wii directly.

Fast forward to about 10 minutes ago, and I'm texting a friend from school that I haven't spoken to in ages. Well I'll be damned if messages didn't start coming from my number asking her for pictures. Luckily I caught on in time before whoever is texting from my number started asking for nudes or worse, and I was able to alert her that that WAS NOT ME.

I'm an honours computer science student (graduating next year) that has heavy interest in the it security field. Unfortunately my university only offers one security course, which was a course that touched on many fundamental computer security techniques such as: encryption methods, public key cryptography, hash function and signature schemes, key exchange protocols, authentication and access control models. It also had some stuff on multimedia security, intrusion detection, copyright and password protection, and protection from malicious programs. The problem was the course was very wide and didn't really go into too much depth about anything. I did very well in the course, and it left me wanting more.

As far as I can tell most security/ethical hacking related material is in book form. I browsed this subreddit and found a few books that were recommended but I'm just worried that they may be outdated considering the field of information technology's pace.

I guess I'm wondering how I can get the required knowledge to work in this area. I'll be graduating with an honours in computer science as well as a degree in business administration (2 degrees) next year, and I'm wondering if the next step is something like the CISSP. Should I just be looking for jobs that are it security focused? What sort of work experience should I look at obtaining to increase my value in this industry? I'm interning right now at a reputable company as a software designer and although  I like it I'd really rather do something in security. I've also played around with some of the I/O wargames like smashthestack, but I got to a point where what I've learned in university couldn't really take me any further.

I'll take a look at any recommended books, websites, or advice and thanks in advance for any help. 

Edit: Also, I've been using a lot of C#, java, and vb.net for development. I learned some basic C++ way back in highschool, but it looks as if C++ is the way too go for security and hacking. Should that be something I should try to practice more in?

They say all the Error Reports from the event log are really bad attacks from hackers and they want to help me clean it up.

I want to hack the hacker!!!

I'm decently familiar enough with malware and Windows to where I think I can execute an attack back to the scammers machine -- but I could use some help with ideas.

So the people calling are 'Tech Support'.  They have strong accents and claim they need to help me fix my computer.  I've been recording the entire conversation and will make a post about it when I'm done.

They want to use a remote desktop program (ammyy . com) and have me grant access to them.

I'm building a clean Windows 7 machine that is isolated on my network that I can use to provide them access.  

I'm assuming that they want to pilfer my documents and probably install a backdoor.

I want to hack them back.

I've installed a covert keylogger to the machine which will take screenshots and will keep track of accessed files.  I've also got a snapshot program which will allow me to track changes to the machine.  I'm trying to fill my box with all sorts of junk documents and bogus contact information.  I'll be running ARPSpoof on a Linux machine that should help me collect the network information as it goes across the network.

All that's great, but I want to take it a step further (we can debate the morality and legality of all this later).

I'm thinking that if I can get them to actually execute a file from my machine while on their machine, I can either gain access to their computer via a RAT or gain access to other information via the installation of a keylogger.

I need them to execute a PE file but I'm sure they won't do it if it has a .exe extension.  I need to crypt a .exe as a .doc or .xls or something so that I can put the file in a very obvious place with a name such as 'password_list.xls' so that they will try and open the file.

Alternatively -- I'm sure there is a PDF hack that I could use and accomplish the same goal.


Does anyone want to help me out with this?  I'm sure it'll be great fun!

Maybe I could social engineer them, but I'm not coming up with any ideas on how I could get them to execute a file.",,False,,t5_2qhva,False,,,True,t3_17zefk,http://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/17zefk/hacking_a_hacker_help_me_do_it_reddit/,

more often, or discover nearby stations in a completely different way?

Of course I got monitor mode and all the usual requirements (i.e. aireplay-ng completely works etc).

My ultimate goal would be to find all stations (preferably associated as well as not associated to an AP)
within reach in about 10 seconds or less.

I need some advice on this, what can I do ?

Should I focus in a Language, right ? Then, wich one ? Any ""fun"" projects I can do ?
Maybe I'm worrying too much, I'm only 14, but I've been learning CS since I was like... 10 years old, and my progress is... 0 ! (Well, I actually know how to use Linux properly, and I know a bit of English also).

I've also started learning and understanding linux 1 year ago with a virtual private server that I mainly use for hosting my websites now. I've switched to linux on my laptop as well about 1 or 2 months ago.

What I'd like to know is where I'd need to go from now to learn more about hacking. I know there's a lot of different type of hacking but I'm mainly interrested in:

* Game hacking (Memory addresses&amp;pointers etc)
* Network hacking (started using aircrack-ng for wep&amp;wpa hacking 2 weeks ago and ettercap for arp poisoning and dns spoofing)
* Doxing someone from an ip/username/whatever

In the past, when I've reported security issues that were somebody else's job to fix, they've simply pretended I don't exist. The only way to get the holes fixed around here is to show them how bad it would be if someone abused the security hole.

I recently discovered a way that anybody can upload any files to the web server and make them publicly accessible. So, for example, I can upload bro.html to ourwebsite.com/blahblah/, and then everybody on the internet can visit ourwebsite.com/blahblah/bro.html.

I want to demonstrate the severity of this vulnerability by doing something that will embarrass the people whose problem it is and get them to fix it, but not something so bad that it will get me fired or anything (I could, theoretically, do this anonymously, but that would require breaking extra rules). I figure this should involve uploading html, php, and/or javascript files and getting them to do something interesting. What seems especially promising is getting the server to run .php files.

However, I'm really more of a hardware/general OS maintenance sort of guy, and I don't know a whole lot about web stuff, especially php, so I don't know exactly what to do. Ideas?

NINJA EDIT: Alternatively, since the web server itself isn't subject to the company web filter, how can I get it to work as a VPN or proxy for me to get around the filter?

1327522295.0,10,self.hacking,owhgq,Question on the history of password cracking,Vordreller,11,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/owhgq/question_on_the_history_of_password_cracking/,"Bit of a question on password security here.

Back when I was a kid and Win95 was the OS to get, there was this program you could get off the internet that you would run and it would sit there guessing a password. Tons of people did this with that same program and the first person to send in the correct password would win a cash prize.

My father ran this program cuz he thought it was fun to see how it worked.

And how it worked(wink wink) is what puzzles me a bit, especially in the perspective of today's password policies of 1 at capital letter, 1 number and 1 special symbol.

The program would run for several weeks and then reveal 1 letter. The program said that this letter was certain to be correct. Without a doubt.

I'm sitting here, I don't know how I came to remembering this program, but I'm thinking to myself: ""this isn't right...""

So I was wondering: was there a fundamental change in how they did things back in 1995, or was this just a botnet before botnets were cool?

Far as I can tell, if you want to hack a password you need to know the entire password, you can't just try individual letters.

So basically, a short complex password isn't very secure against a brute force attack. Rather a long, simple would be more secure, [as explained by XKCD](http://xkcd.com/936/)

So, what's up with that program I remembered?",,False,,t5_2qhva,False,,,True,t3_owhgq,http://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/owhgq/question_on_the_history_of_password_cracking/,
