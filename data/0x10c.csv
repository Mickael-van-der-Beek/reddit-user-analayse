Just wanted to thank you Notch. when you announced this game i was drifting from game to game looking for something to excite me. a new world to explore. a new game mechanic to amaze me. just generally bored. My friend pointed me toward this game and i got really excited and decided it would be worth the time spent to learn this dcpu-16 ASM. 

well a month or so later and i've picked up some python, some C and a little java and have started writing my own little code pieces (right now i'm working on a simple asteroids clone as a small bite sized one man educational project in python/pygame).

I wake up excited every day to work on my project. i'm a happy guy. i smile. for YEARS i've been looking for something to stimulate my brain and make it work in new and interesting ways. the process of figuring out HOW to accomplish something (that bit of work between having an idea and actually writing code to make it happen) is MY ZONE!!!! my brain feels alive and engaged now.

As you've probably figured out if you're reading this subreddit, Notch has had a pulsar feed (more info [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/t4255/summary_of_info_on_the_pulsar_feed/)) where he's been sending out data to the connected computers. But, this data is only sent out *if* enough computers are connected. Right now, we're on 69% power, and we need to get to 100% to see a message on the feed you've probably clicked the link and not seen anything, so you closed it. Just saying, *stay connected*! Even if you just leave the tab open in the background, it'll help us!

EDIT: here's the link: http://psrx0392-15.0x10c.com/

EDIT: If you're on a linux box with ncat command, you might want to try this command to connect:

    while :; do ncat -v psrx0392-15.0x10c.com 80; done

On a mac, try this:

    while :; do nc -v psrx0392-15.0x10c.com 80; done

For the past little while, I've been building [0x10c-cloud.com](http://0x10c-cloud.com/).  It's a new site, community and set of services and tools for 0x10c with some cool features and unique twists.

All content is user-submitted and can be voted on (ala Reddit), searched, tagged etc.  I've seeded it with a few bits and pieces from the web to get things started.

Check out the homepage/About section to get the full rundown, but here are some cool bits:

* Program previews, gallery mode: [see here](http://0x10c-cloud.com/Programs)
* Message boards: [see here](http://0x10c-cloud.com/Forums)
* Emulation and rendering is *streamed* and, being powered by DevKit, has a shared codebase
* CodePad for quick prototyping
* ""Loadouts"" concept: XML-based hardware definition

This is honestly the first 'real' public community site I've put together and I'd call it a beta for now - who knows what I might have missed in terms of bugs or gotchas.  There's plenty missing and plenty left to do - more language conversions, Q&amp;A database, etc etc - all on the roadmap.

The DevKit version powering it has been updated with the latest vector specs ([see here for a cool tag-based search](http://0x10c-cloud.com/Programs/AllPrograms/List/Hot/vector/-/5)) and disk drive specs - I just wanted to prioritise getting the *first version* of the site out of the door, and I'll put out a new DevKit with the above and latest C (toolchain) support etc.

Anyway, check it out, sign up, post some comments or content if you like - and enjoy the rest of your weekend.

I'm not too familiar with assembly, but I do know my way around computers and I can program, so I poked around at Notch's setup (like so many other people) and got a feel for the whole thing. While the others are busy making assemblers/deassemblers/compilers (hah I wish)/whatchamacallits, I've decided to write a simple overview of the system, so that even YOU* can try your hand at ""self-sufficiency"". For the purpose of this tutorial, I’ll be looking at [Mappum’s awesome emulator](http://mappum.github.com/DCPU-16/) for any and all examples. To use it, put any assembly code you write in the left box, hit reset, hit compile, and then press step to step through cycles and watch it run. I suggest not pressing run, as things might move too quickly.

*YOU: Someone with little to no programming experience

**Anyway, let's get started:**

Essentially, the entire DCPU-16 is a bunch of RAM. Really, that’s about it (kinda, don’t tell the experienced coders I said this). Each “word” of RAM (of which there are 65,536) is four characters of hex. Hex is a number system that’s base-16 (unlike ours which is base-10) and always starts with “0x” (seen that anywhere else?). I’m not going to explain hex here, so you can Google that if you want (though, Google is really cool, and will translate hex to decimal if you enter “0x#### to decimal” and replace #s with the actual characters). Anyway, four characters of hex is 16 digits of binary, which allows us a number between 0 and 65,535 for each word. Cool, right?

What’s in a word though? Well, it can be tons of things. Usually, the first bunch of words in RAM will contain the code for a project, because that’s just how it is. Still, even though it’s considered “code” it’s really just a number. But, you don’t have to worry about that, since assemblers take care of translating your code into the numbers for you. Instead, just understand that different places in the RAM might contain information that tells the CPU how to run.

Other places could just contain values. Maybe you need to store the number 42 so you always know what the ultimate answer is, for example. Though, outside of RAM are 8 registers that can also be used to store values. These are labeled a, b, c, x, y, z, i, and j. This is nice, because instead of having to remember to call up [0x1A32] for a value each time you need it, you can just have it assigned to one of those registers. That [0x1A32] references a specific spot in RAM, in that case it would call on the 6,706th word. The []s signify that we’re grabbing the value at that location, instead of just talking about the location (if we’re setting it to a value) or a number (if we want to set something else to 0x1A32). But, we’ll kind of touch on that later.

If you’ve played around with Mappum’s emulator, you’ve probably also noticed the “PC” below all of the registers. PC refers to the specific spot in memory that’s being read at that point in time. It starts at 0000 (so reading the first spot in memory) and works its way up indefinitely. This will be very important later on, because it can be modified just like other values (so the CPU will read whatever word you want, instead of just going up and up and up), but it’s important I explain the basic commands first.

Commands (or opcodes, as they’re actually referred to as) are really small values in RAM that serve as shortcuts for telling the computer what to do. Because we’re using Mappum’s emulator, we don’t have to worry about the values that they represent in RAM, because we get to just type the actual command and have everything handled for us. The first, and probably most important, example is this:

    SET a, b

This, quite simply, sets one value to another. “a” is the value you’re modifying, and it can pretty much be anything. It can be a register (like “A” or “X”), a spot in memory (like [0x1000]), the PC, or a couple other things that I’m not going to get into for the purpose of presenting the absolute basics. “b” can really be any of these things as well. For instance, if you want to set register B to 1, you could type “SET B, 0x0001”. Then, if you wanted to set register A to the value of register B, you could type “SET A, B”. Other commands can [be found here](http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt), but I’ll give you two more examples just for show:

    ADD a, b

This one works very similarly to SET, but, instead of setting “a” to “b”, adds “b” to whatever “a” is. The same is for SUB (subtract), MUL (multiple), DIV (divide), and a few others. These will also modify O (overflow) if they, well, overflow, but don’t worry about that too much for now. Finally:

    IFE a, b

There are a couple IF statements built in, but this is the most basic. Basically, it will perform the following line (command) as long as “a” equals “b”. At the end of this overview, I’ll dissect a really simple FOR loop, which uses IFN (runs if “a” doesn’t equal “b”) which should help explain how this works in more detail. Before that, however, there’s one last important basic to show you.

    :a

This is how we label subroutines in this kind of assembly. Essentially, you’ll replace “a” with whatever you want to call your subroutine, and that way you can target it whenever you need to. For example, if I use one line of my program to type “:testsub”, and on the next line I type “SET PC, testsub” it will set PC to the location in RAM that I entered “:testsub” sending the execution of code back to wherever that happened to be. To really wrap together this, and everything else I explained here, I’ll outline a really simple loop:

    SET I, 0x000A
    :loop
        SUB I, 0x0001
        IFN I, 0
            SET PC, loop
        SET A, 0xFFFF

The first line of this sets register I to 0x000A, which is hex for 10. The next line creates the subroutine “loop”. Directly after that, it subtracts 0x0001 (1) from I. Then, using “IFN” it checks I, and if I doesn’t equal 0, it sets PC to loop, causing the execution of code to return to that point. This subtracts another 1 from I, and checks again to see if I is 0. Once I is 0, it will stop setting PC back to loop, and continues to the next line where A is set to 0xFFFF (65,535).

I hope this overview has been helpful to you. I have to go now, so I can’t respond to any questions or comments until tomorrow, but I appreciate anything you guys have to say. Also, if any actual professionals would like to make a correction, just leave me a message (or a comment) and I’ll check it when I get the chance. Thanks!

EDIT: Typed this in Google Docs so I wouldn't lose anything, but that meant losing access to RES ""Insert-A-Link"" functionality. Fixed broken links. Also, I ""need"" to stop using """"s.

**EDIT 2**: As per user request, I ended up writing a little explanation of the stack (SP, POP, PUSH, PEEK). I don't know how correct I am, because I'm not too familiar with the idea (I only know similar concepts), but you can find what I wrote [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/rvs5g/overview_of_the_dcpu16_for_newbies_to_end_the/c495cjw)

By that I do not mean that the development is taking to long, or that I feel that the game is to far out in the future (game play wise).  

What bothers me is pretty simple and easily over looked.  0x10c starts off in the year 281,474,976,712,644 AD.  That's 281.4 ***trillion*** years into the future.  Now lets look at the Unix time stamp (which is a 64-bit integer, btw).  [At 15:30:08 UTC on 4 December 292,277,026,596 AD, the Unix time stamp will exceed the largest value that can be held in a signed 64-bit integer.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future#Technology_and_culture)  Even with a 64-bit integer, there is still an excess of 281,182,699,686,048 years left over.

Now, I know that some people are not grasping what I'm trying to get across.  What I'm saying is that even if we used a 64-bit integer, the system time/clock will roll over a total of *963 times* before the crews even wake up.  This can cause *serious* issues with systems that rely on time.  Such as the cryostasis machines everyone wakes up from.  Actually, *we would never wake up from it even if we used a 64-bit int*.

So that would mean we would have to use a 128-bit integer.  That would remedy the issue of never ending cryostasis and the clocks rolling over hundreds of times.  But there in lies a problem.  In order for that to work, the company would had to of set that up.  But why would they set up a 16-bit system to use a 128-bit time stamp?  Remember, at the time when these systems where all being made no one even had a remote idea that these systems would be in use 231 trillion years in the future.

To reiterate, the problem is that **no one would ever wake up if the system used a 32-bit time stamp.**

It was the beginning of an operating system, but it really didn't resemble a true OS that much.

But I've been developing it thoroughly for the past two days, and the result is something that I hope the more technically inclined will appreciate while non-programmers enjoy what's already built in.

The OS design is as follows:

* A monolithic kernel with an integrated bootloader and some standard functions mostly following the ABI (like memcpy, strlen, print...)

* A simple operating system with a basic prompt and a few built-in commands and an application loader (see the load_cleanf, load_echof, load_openf subroutines in src/0x42c.dasm16). This is very cool, because the applications include a jump table so they can use the functions exposed by the kernel and the OS.
* A collection of ""demo"" applications to showcase how programs should behave and interact with the OS and kernel.

The compile.sh generates a binary kernel.bin that can be loaded in most EMUs. I use DCPU16-Studio and all the functions work there.

Currently, it mashes together all the programs, the OS and the kernel. In the future, when Notch releases IO specs (*please!*), the OS and programs will be theoretically loaded from whatever storage. With the current system architecture, this is very easy to implement.

** Build process **

You'll need noname22's assembler to assemble the whole thing. You can get it from [here](https://github.com/noname22/dtools/). Copy the ""dasm"" binary to the 0x42c folder and run ./compile.sh

** Features **

* Command prompt
* Backspace works!
* Loadable applications
* Very fast, hand-optimized scroll routine.
* Easter egg(s)!

** Screenshots ** 

http://u.jdiez.me/2012-04-09_15-59-43.png

** How to use it **

If you're not a programmer, you can just grab ""kernel.bin"" from the github repo and load it to your emulator of choice.

&gt;The name might be a clue. It indicates a pulsar at 03h 92m RA, -15° dec, but you would never write 92m because that would roll over to 4h 32m. I doubt he'd make that mistake in the name, so I'm inclined to believe the name is a clue. I still support my ""binary pulsar"" theory from earlier though.

I should have this thing producing far higher quality output tonight, and then it's on to making it do more interesting things!



I'm writing a compiler that targets DCPU assembly. I will be releasing the source as soon as I finish some most of the basic features of the language. In the meantime, it can handle basic mathematical expressions, assignments, variables, and branching. You can try it out too. http://jemgine.omnisu.com/projects/DCPUC.zip I haven't written a spec on the language yet but here are the basics -

var a; //declare a variable.
a = 4; //assignment.
a = 5 * 2 + 3; //Math!
if (a == 13) //Branching
{
   a = 4; 
}


Edit - Alright. It has 'pointers' now, but there's no type system. You can dereference anything with the unary * operator. Example
    var a;
    a = 0x8000;
    *a = 72;
will write an 'H' to memory location 0x8000, which happens to be the first character on the screen.

It also has functions. 
    
    function fib(n) 
    {
       if (n == 0) return 0;
       if (n == 1) return 1;
       return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
    }

    var a;
    a = fib(6);

Compile this and paste the output into your emulator of choice (I've been testing with http://mappum.github.com/DCPU-16/ so I recommend that one) and let it run. It needs some optimization (it took 1065 cycles to run) but when it's done you should see '8' at memory address 0xFFFE!

I never played Minecraft. I watched about ten minutes of it and thought it was just not my kind of game. I did make a token attempt at writing a client for it, until I saw what a fubar the network protocol spec is.

I have never been in the Cult of Notch. I watched about four minutes of his Ludum Dare live stream, until I stopped to do my own Ludum Dare project.

I was a child of the 80s. I learned to program on a TI-99/4A. I've been a professional programmer for pushing 20 years now. I have done a little bit of embedded stuff (Parallax chips and Lego NXT, mostly).

This project has the potential for over-the-top awesomeness. I spent time in Corewars, and C-Robots, and Terrarium.net, and I *love* this kind of game. It appeals to me *way* more than mining big blocks. I could actually see myself never actually playing 0x10c at all; just making software for it.

I have been blown away by some of the talent in this (and /r/dcpu16) reddit. There are some pretty good coders in here. I wrote my own assembler, and I'm about done with a higher level (basic-ish) language, but some of the full studio platforms have been impressive. I'm almost hesitant to release anything, given some of the other tools that are out already.

I have been dismayed by some of the fan-boy-ism as well. I guess that goes with the territory. Notch has such *amazing* community capital, that he can release a *hint* of a game, and people are already jumping to create community standards and speculating about things that are utterly vaporware at this point. You can't buy that kind of influence. People are learning *assembly*. That is pretty amazing.

I don't know what to expect in the future. I made some language tools, which have been in my bucket list for a while. The ""game"" part of all of this doesn't really sound that fun. But who knows. Me speculating on the game is just as silly as anyone else speculating on the game.

So the last week has been a mixed bag. I'll wait and see what the next few weeks bring before I render any kind of solid verdict.

Any discrepancy between the clocks of two different units would mean waking up lifetimes after someone else. 

Assuming that there is some tracking device making sure everyone wakes up near enough to each other not to have been red-shifted away, I think this could be an opportunity: Discovery of a long-dead community.

This other community had already grouped together, lived and died by the time our wave of travellers arrives. I think we could find them in a distant reach of the space, orbiting something. The region would be devoid of minerals, but there would be equipment, etc.

And codes.

You see, I think that some of what we all come up with before the game is launched could all be loaded up over there, or perhaps require the player to go there to get a co-processor or somesuch. 

It becomes a quest through a barren land to a fabled place of riches.

And it would be a great place for Notch to hide an awful, awful virus...

If we had a beta version of the game, it could become the derelict community when it finishes...

Basically, you start on a planet with nothing (Sounds like another game Notch has made before) From there you gather materials such as wood and stone to construct factories, farms, housing, and eventually spacecraft factories! Design your own spacecraft and explore the galaxy. Fight pirates or players, the choice is yours!


I'm not sure how similar 0x10c will be to Shores of Hazeron, but I think they may end up looking similar with graphics, but game play should be completely different.

In the article, Notch indicates that he may decide to restart development on 0x10c, at least in part, because as it stands the game just isn't fun. It's not very fun to walk around in the ship, a big part of what makes it cool

&gt;And I might possibly start over, because it feels like… it’s not fun, the stuff you’re actually doing. If it’s not fun to walk around the spaceship then the game isn’t fun. So I need to figure that out and try to, not necessarily gamify, but add more instant gratification. 


If Notch does backtrack to fix some of the game's engine, here are some suggestions I'd have:

 * Instead of placing shapes to design your ship, give us premade elements we can customize, like whole walls we can define the length of, or control panels we can adjust the placement of buttons on.

 * Stop trying too hard to stick to accurate science. Frankly, real life starship travel would be boring as heck. I prefer it if crashing into a planet means having to search for components to repair the ship rather than just dying. 

 * Once you have a basic way of creating the ship and moving around (and of course, once you have the DCPU back up, since that's the coolest goddamned part of this game's design) start working on how we will place things like engines, weapons, shields, etc. At the point where we have functioning engines, shields, and weapons, and then have I/O locations for the DCPU to control those things, we have something of a game to play around with, and you can actually release it to be played. 

Anyway. If Notch does restart development, what would you guys want him to change in the design to try to make it feel more fun?",,False,self,t5_2tu92,False,,,True,t3_zeffz,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/zeffz/notch_may_restart_development_on_0x10c_to_improve/,

So that a mined out asteroid is literally mined out, or a quarry on a planet is literally a chunk of dented earth. Entire moons could be eliminated from huge mining ops.

Since a good chunk of the planets are randomly generated and there aren't any textures in the game the idea of polygon pushing isn't that outlandish. I'm not sure how notch will implement models and how the netcode is going to work but it could be done. However,  physics could be an issue, since a moon losing 1/4 of its mass would change its orbit.

* ***real-life***

NASA's Saturn V could travel at 6,000 miles per hours. This is *0.00000894698959 times the speed of light*.

---

* ***Serenity*** / ***Firefly*** 

It would take Serenity about 2,770 years to travel a lightyear. This would be *0.000360962302 times the speed of light*.

---

* ***Alien***

The Nostomo traveled 37 lightyears (11.35 parsecs) in 10 months giving it a speed of *44.4 times the speed of light*.

---

* ***Star Trek*** (the original series)

Although it was a bit inconsistent, Warp 1 was the speed of light. The Enterprise's cruise speed of Warp 6 was 216 times the speed of light. By taking a great risk of damaging the warp core, Warp 9 could be obtained allowing travel at *729 times the speed of light*.

---

* ***Star Trek: The Next Generation***

The warp scale has been adjusted since the original series. Warp 1 is still the speed of light, but Warp 10 is now the speed of being everywhere at once. The Enterprise D has an average cruise speed of Warp 6 (692.5 times the speed of light) and a max cruise speed of a little over Warp 9 which theoretically should have been 1516.38 times the speed of light, but was usually a little less that *1000 times the speed of light* in both *The Next Generation* and *Voyager*.

---

* ***Star Wars***

Exact speeds aren't discussed much - probably because of the whole Kessler Run thing. But if a star ship can cross the galaxy in around 4 days, we get *9 million times the speed of light*.

---

* ***Futurama***

The Planet Express Ship can travel at 97% the speed of the *new* speed of light. (Scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.) Farnsworth states it can travel between galaxies in hours.

 \- *9,000,000 times the speed of old light speed* (at the bare minimum - calculated nearest galaxy of Canis Major Dwarf taking a day to reach.)

 \- *2,000,000,000 times the speed of old light speed* (would be possible if it could travel to Andromeda II in 8 hours)

---


* ***0x10^c***

How fast should players be able to travel in 0x10c? What is a fun speed? The longest flight path in World of Warcraft takes about 30 minutes.[[1](http://www.chacha.com/question/what-is-the-longest-flight-path-in-world-of-warcraft)] In Minecraft it takes about 40 minutes to travel 10,000 blocks by land under ideal conditions.

Star systems less than 10 ly away from our own:

system|distance
:--|:--
Rigil Kentaurus|4.3 ly
Barnard's Star|6.0 ly
Wolf 359|7.8 ly
Lalande 21185|8.3 ly
Sirius|8.6 ly
Luyten 726-8|8.7 ly
WISE 1541-2250|9.3 ly
V1216 Sagittarii|9.7 ly

If we could travel a lightyear per minute (*526,000 times the speed of light*) that might be a good speed, allowing us to travel to all stars in a 30 ly radius in 30 minutes or less.

In the future, though, there may not be so many stars. It might be better to think in terms of crossing the galaxy. Earth is about 27,000 ly away from the galaactic center of Milky Way. If we ca Milky Way is between 100k and 120k ly in diameter.

If we could travel at 1,000 ly per minute (*526,000,000 times the speed of light*) we could travel between earth and the galactic core in half an hour, or if we travel in the opposite direction, we could reach the fringe in about 30 minutes as well.

This would be within the realm of Futurama-type speeds. 

Here's a possible explanation - Maybe our ships can't travel faster than light, however over the hundreds of trillions of year with the aging and shifting of the universe, the maximum speed of light has increased by a billion times. Meanwhile, our ships only have a speed of around 5 times the speed of light.

This would explain why we would need hypersleep on ships that can travel across the galaxy in hours, because back in the 1980's it would have taken thousands of years.

**Edit:** Increasing the speed of light by a *trillion* times would allow light-based messages and network packets to reach any ship or planet anywhere in the galaxy in less than 4 seconds. This would be very useful for communications. Meanwhile, our space ships could be limited to a more reasonable 0.05% light speed.",,False,self,t5_2tu92,True,,,True,t3_sx1l4,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/sx1l4/how_fast_should_ships_be_able_to_travel/,

Well I was a little bored in the last few days, since it's summer holidays at uni and all. So I decided to write a little something for the DCPU.
So here I present to you my humble attempts to write an interactive commandline or OS if you want to call it that for the DCPU.

**Commands**

* help - prints help
* inc v- increases value and prints the result
* add v1 v2 - adds both values together and prints result
* sub v1 v2 - subtracts v2 from v1 and prints result
* sadd var v1 v2 - adds v1 and v2 and stores result in var
* ssub var v1 v2 - subtracts v2 from v1 and stores result in var

* dev dn A B C - sends an HWI interrupt to the device dn with A B and C * set according to parameters
* devicelist - prints a list of all recognized devices with their device numbers
* rdd sec - attempts to read the sector sec from a Harold Media Drive (Seems to be broken in the emulator)
* memset adr val - sets the memory at address adr to the value val
* newline - prints a new line (only useful for scripts)
* exec addr - starts interpreting a string starting at addr as console commands
* jne rel val1 val2 - jumps rel characters in the string if val1 and val 2 are not equal (unsigned so to jump backwards use 65536-rel as value for rel)
* asm cadr dadr - compiles assembly from cadr into machine code and stores the result at dadr (dadr must be bigger or equal to hb000)
* jsr adr - jumps to adr with a jsr instruction

**Values**

You can prefix values with h to have them interpreted as hex or v to read the value from a variable.
So h0010 would be 16 in dec and v10 would be the value of the variable with index 10



**Assembly**

* Labels can only have numeric values and need to be prefixed with a capital L
* Parameters are separated by spaces not by a comma
* You can only use capital letters for opcodes and registers
* Literal Values work the same as with the console commands (So write hfedc instead of 0xfedc)

[Edit]

Ad you can see in these two screenshots, I can now load modules from HMD at runtime, compile them and register commands for use with the console.

I would upload that to 0x10co.de but unfortunately their HMD implementation appears to be broken, at least for me.

* Perhaps the main note, and biggest cause of concern: Do we really need such a dark theme? For starters, it clashes a *lot* with the standard Reddit, well, ""look"". More importantly, though, I can't read things, because there's nowhere near enough contrast between the background and the text. The idea of a colour scheme is to make text easy to read, not make things ""look cool"" or provide atmosphere. That can be a goal, but it's very secondary to ""present content nicely.""

* A lot of browser additions made for Reddit, designed to work with Reddit's default colourscheme and those close to it, judicially cause things to look even more broken, visually jarring and, well, generally bad. Yes, those who use RES (for example) can just turn off the style, ultimately leaving a out-of-place black logo (itself critique-able, but perhaps another time) against the familiar baby blues of Reddit.

* We know very little about 0x10c currently - Heck, less than a week ago we thought it was an April Fool's gag. We've seen, what, five screenshots, maximum? Hence, very little of the game's artistic, visual direction and design is known. With such little direction, do we really need a huge-wizz-bang custom CSS at the moment?

I can understand the want for a custom theme - Done right it can look darn impressive, such as the one over on r/atheism; but done wrong, I'd argue, perhaps even hurts the community by making the subreddit less visually attractive.

We have very little artistic direction from the game, currently, and while it's an appreciable effort, goal, and idea, I feel it's a quite premature.

It goes without saying, of course, but I mean to offend no-one. But the current style... I feel it should be removed, retooled, perhaps even developed on a subreddit designed for the purpose, re-implemented when we have more thematic data to work with.",,False,self,t5_2tu92,False,,,True,t3_rw80a,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/rw80a/concerns_regarding_the_recent_style_changes/,

So I hope I'm not the only one who hates this idea. It removes a huge amount of possibilities from the game.

I know notch has said he may change anything and he was just brainstorming but we need to let him know what we think about his ideas before he finalises them.

What do you think? If you agree let notch know how you feel!

I was personally hoping for some sort of eve like server structure.

Edit:

A lot of people have made some points about the lack of infrastructure present at Mojang and how that may effect Notch's decision about how to set up the server, my response would be that infrastructure doesn't just pop out of thin air Eve didn't start with a huge server farm so why would Notch?

As long as he writes the server in something other than Java he should be fine the physical hardware can be obtained, I do understand that this may or may not be profitable for notch but it really depends on how well he makes the server, If he makes it like he did the Minecraft server then we will be lucky if we don't lag out with 4 man instances.

Over the years CCP (the creators of eve) have often pointed out that a lot of the lag created in eve has a lot to do with poorly designed software, admittedly they also have some very powerful servers to help elevate the problem as well but this wasn't always the case the game grew slowly so there is no reason notch cant do the same.",,False,self,t5_2tu92,True,,,True,t3_se9vm,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/se9vm/worries_about_the_multiverse/,

Supposedly, in this area, is a heavily-armoured, but unarmed, space station, derelict and unmanned, rife for piracy or theft.

You spot the tower-shaped object on your radar, and it slowly looms into view. The lights inside flicker erratically, perhaps power is failing. All seems too good to be true, until your lights start flickering too. Suddenly, your engine cuts, your screens go dark, and the last sound you hear is that of the airlock door unlocking...

From somewhere in deep space is heard a mayday message from a lost ship, something about a space station completely undefended, named the Bastion.

**The Bastion**

Rather than building an agile ship or a mining ship, I'll build a large space station, packed with DCPUs and armour, and as many generators as viable (assuming more than one is even allowed).

* Main communications DCPU to handle inbound messages from nearby ships and salvage messages from viruses.
* Main radar DCPU to detect nearby ships and pass them to the viral DCPUs.
* Power management DCPU to handle generator wattage to necessary systems.
* Viral DCPUs, many in number, transmit viruses of various kinds to detected ships to disable them. 

**Cyber Warfare**

Lacking outright weaponry, the station's main firepower both offensive and defensive will be in its vast array of viral DCPUs packing a variety of viruses.

* Straightforward known-vulnerability viruses
* Simple irritant viruses, that run long meaningless loops to occupy DCPU cycles
* ""Matilda""-style viruses, that alter values from keyboards and in memory
* ""Smart"" viruses, that change themselves as they assault a system until it is disabled

All viruses have at the end of their operation a victory check, checking whether it can enable and disable the drive core, lights, etc. to discern if the virus has successfully disabled the ship's onboard systems.

Once any virus manages to disable an attacking ship, the comms system of the station receives a salvage message. The message itself will be a pseudo-random string of numbers, recalculated by the comms DCPU and distributed to the viral DCPUs on a regular basis, suspended when new ships are detected (to ensure that the virus always has the latest version).

**Looting**

Whenever the station comms gets that salvage message, an appraisal of the disabled ship is made and it is sent one of two viruses, both of which wipe all other memory on the ship as their first operation (to remove any booby traps as well as the attack viruses themselves).

* If the ship is marked for scrap, the virus programs navigation back into the ship and pilots it into a set of co-ordinates relative to the station to land it in the hangars
* If the ship is marked for drone, the virus programs an evasive swarm pattern of navigation and weapon use, cloaking included, attached to the radar system, and reduces the communications systems to an occasional transmission of the Bastion legend. No communication is accepted once this virus takes hold, drone ships are autistic and do not maintain life support, attacking any ship that they don't recognise as the station itself.

All other messages received by the station comms system are rendered as text to screens, no networking capabilities will be installed for external contact by the station, to reduce if not eliminate attempts at cyber warfare affecting it, in effect a space station focusing on network warfare will itself be an autistic system.

However... having everything DCPU-based seems rather limiting to me. It *is* an intriguing idea in that everyone has to learn a lower-level language and work within the confines of the limited abilities given to you, and that can be fun in its own right.

Imagine this, though: the game has no DCPU at all. Instead, each ship has nothing more than an API. Literally: the game program that is running on your computer would actually be hosting a REST API for you to plug your own applications into. The first-person aspect of it wouldn't exist; the game would only have a camera feed to look at the ship and the local surroundings (also accessible through the API), and a startup/shutdown/options menu. A default, simple but limited interface would also be optionally available to serve as something to get started with, from both a gameplay and development standpoint.

Now, we lose the limits of the DCPU, and with that you lose the limits that force you to be creative with your programming. However, we gain a wild array of options for how to play the game, and those are plenty creative on their own. Here are some possibilities:

1.   One ship would be owned by a player with no programming chops, using a popular open-source desktop application that has become the de-facto standard interface for the game. Using it, that is, until a week later when a zero-day vulnerability is discovered and he finds his shields dropping in combat *Wrath of Khan* style. (That'd only be possible with an in-game communication network, I know, but why shouldn't there be one?)
2.   Another ship could be a guy who built his own command-line interface for his ship in his spare time as a Ruby script - just to see if you could run a ship that way. 
3.   One person has a couple servers driving a fleet of several dozen ships powered by a custom bot that he wrote, presenting a swarm guided by a pilot vessel that he operates. Because each operating ship requires an game license, that option came with a real price - which he regrets as his targets tend to avoid him like the plague.
4.   A group of friends is playing using an [Artemis](http://www.artemis.eochu.com/)-style web application that allows six people to control various systems on the ship, with a captain barking out commands, a weapons officer firing the guns, and a communications officer [insulting everyone's mothers](http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/10/27/all-hands-on-desk-pcg-plays-the-best-star-trek-game-youve-never-heard-of-artemis-spaceship-bridge-simulator/).
5.   Some ships are run from mobile devices - the requests from those apps are forwarded to processes running in the cloud.
6.   Several dozen players are part of an alliance; this alliance has its own proprietary application for fleet coordination that connects with the standard ship interface the alliance has decided upon. This allows the alliance director to command his fleet in large engagements. Or, more likely, keeping everyone the hell away from that guy with the swarm of bot-ships.

It would definitely be an unforgiving environment for the uninitiated - but the DCPU isn't exactly *The Idiot's Guide to Starship Command*, is it?

Why not let the player decide?

The idea came from watching the ""ride of the walkiries"" scene from Apocalypse Now.

Why not let the player choose ""playlists"", select songs and music, accordingly of the situation, like a deep relaxing song when paranoia kicks in, ect...

But what makes me love this idea the most is imagining: if the ship is hit in, for example, the power generator, the music suddenly stopping, leaving suddenly only silence and the sound of the weapons firing around him.

Another idea would be being able to buy old-style gramophones, to keep having a little tune during total forced black-out, like in a nebula.

I can't stop imagining a space traveler, in the pitch black anti-radiation room, slowly spinning the handle of a Victorian style gramophone,

I'm trying to make a suggestion about how to give the programming aspect of the game more robust library of software.  Now that that's out of the way, read on.

Notch has said he was interested in releasing 0x10c with the same billing structure as Minecraft by charging x for alpha, 1.5x for beta, and 2x for final release.  This is probably a good idea because it has worked in the past with Minecraft, but Minecraft had an early release free version called Minecraft Classic.  It's fair to say that Minecraft Classic and the full release bare little resemblance to each other, but as a public free pre-alpha it did help build the very basic physics of player movement and placing blocks, as well as build excitement for the game through screenshots and videos of amazing creations.

My idea would be to release a free version that has nothing but the DCPU powered ship in a arbitrary environment with one planet and star to navigate around.  It doesn't need to be a random or infinite environment. It could be the same small universe repeating as u reach the edge.  It wouldn't even need multiplayer.  The point of it would be to provide an official DCPU emulator in an environment that makes sense.  A place to let people play with the ships controls and create cool software that would be functional in the real game.  The fact that so may DCPU emulators and software are starting to pop up is great, but none of these emulators or programs will be able to interact with the ships controls, sensors, and displays.  Maybe make it posible to spawn multiple ships so we can experiment with inter-ship communications and networking.  Getting a fully featured emulator in the hands of as many people as possible is a good way to insure a large and functional software library when the paid release comes out.  By releasing a free version that is little more than an emulator so the programming gurus can play with it, you would ensure that the paid version is a more fun experience for the non-programmatically inclined. It would even help to build excitement for the game as interesting and exciting creations start to pop up on the internet.",,False,self,t5_2tu92,True,,,True,t3_s50rc,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/s50rc/0x10c_classic_free_prealpha_edition/,

Hello guys!

So, a great development effort has started for bringing our dream vision of 0x10c to life. However, this subreddit makes for a bad place to get organized. This thread hopes to change that for the better by proposing a few ideas on how to get organized and by listing all current threads in this subreddit that are related to this game's development.

There are a few important points to consider:

 · We all come from all around the world. While the majority of people here is probably from the US, we still have very different time zones.

 · Reddit is a good place for news and discussion, but not for project management.

 · We have a lot of people with very different interesting ideas, and we don't want them to get lost in a battle of upvotes.

Here is my proposal:

 1. We decide a codename for our project, then someone can set up a forum (based on phpBB or SMF). We should move there for all project management discussions, such as design choices and team building, but we shouldn't abandon this place as it will always be a good place to get other people involved.

 2. Most of us would like to talk about the game in a more immediate fashion. There's already an IRC channel on freenode for that, but we should keep in mind what I said before in regard to different time zones. No collective decisions should be taken in the IRC channel, but rather in the forums.

 3. After we have a forum set up, we should start building the team. We've already started doing it here, but it's a very confusing task. I suggest bringing the current list over in the forum, and then continue organization there.

 4. Once we start building the team, we need two key roles that are still missing: a lead designer and a team manager. They can be the same person, but not necessarily. If you have experience as a designer and you think you have time and dedication for this, make sure to get noticed! 

On safety precautions:

 · We should get some safety precautions in case something goes wrong, for example: the forum organizer goes mad and the forum blows up. Every member of the team should have all other members' email addresses, so that we can quickly rebuild ourselves. We should always keep backups of everything important.

That's all I have to suggest for now. Be sure to comment if you have any other ideas.
When we get a forum set up, I would like to help with community moderation and design, if possible.

If you haven't tried it, give it a go; it probably won't work on your computer and even if it does it's just a keyboard-input-taking screen and some shapes in a dark room with no physics. I just thought 0x10c itself in the most updated (only) form we have would be better than just posting other space games and links to other subs all day.

You can see this document as a mix of 'would-be-nice-if-we-had'-rambling and gameplay-suggestion. Mojang, if you read this, feel free to steal any ideas!

First of, I'd imagine that every player would only get one ship to run at the same time in the same universe. Maybe with the option to start from scratch, and maybe the possibility of obtaining more at the expense of some obscene amount of effort/in-game-currency (eg. 'bribe the ship-licenser with 100 tons of diamonds')
This limitation would be in place to prevent players from simply switching their ship around according to the situation or to quickly gain advantage trough numbers without actual player cooperation.

--- **Building the ship** ---

So now you have your one, abstract ship and want to actually build it / modify your initial-starting model.
I don't think we can go the Minecraft route, because having a ship build out of voxels would be simultaneously to detailed for ship-physics, and to undetailed for nice spaceship designs. Also, Notch has already started that he has something else based around plain-colored polygons in mind.

So, here's my Idea how ship building could work:
First, your ships basic structure is defined by building it out of several modules that are connected to each other, similar to how for example the ISS is build.


*  Bulkheads: 
The majority of your ships structure would consist of them. They are three-dimensional convex rooms of arbitrary integer size. For example, you could have a long 4x4x20 corridor in the middle of your ship, with four 6x3x10 rooms to the sides. Bulkheads would come in 3 complexities with increasing cost, but also increasing build freedom:

   
  *  'square':    only 90° angles allowed. Combined with the convex-restriction pretty much means 'cuboid'
  *  'octagonal': 45° angles allowed.
  *  'hexadecagonal': 22.5° angles allowed.
  

  The reason for this is, that on the one hand you have a simple system of connected boxes, which makes physics checking easier, while on the other hand still allowing for a reasonable amount of freedom. 16 different angles are enough to build something that looks like a circle, and the visible polygon-i-nes would fit into Notchs targeted style. Also, It's a lot easier to get different parts of your ship to align if you only have to worry about a finite number of possible combinations.
  
  You can freely mix and match different complexities, for example have a star-shaped ship consisting of 8 square bulkheads with an octagonal bulkhead connecting them in the middle. Every bulkhead has its own light/life support/gravity setting, so your ships structure and personal needs would determine how you can regulate your power consumption. Gravity especially, can be oriented in the direction of any wall at build time.
So beginners could have a planar, rectangular ship layout, while advanced players could build an three dimensional gravity-maze of interconnected bulkheads.

*   Bulkhead connectors: 
   Basically everywhere where two different bulkhead walls run parallel and touch each other, you can make a connection. They can also be of arbitrary size and one of the 3 complexities. For example, if two square bulkheads would run next to each other but at a 45° angle, you would need an octagonal connector. They conduct energy and the ships control systems, and can also be sealed/closed.

*   Ship engine(s):
   To set the ships main thrust vector. It's location would basically determine where the front side and backside of your ship is, however you may have more of them and also have them pointed in different directions.

*   Windows: 
The Ability to add windows to bulkheads. Should work like connectors, in that you can put a window in any wall.

*   Docking port: 
 A standardized port to physically connect two ships together. Both sides can sever the connection anytime, and it should also be possible to share energy and ship-peripherals over it.

*  Devices that interact with the outside, like radio or sensors:
  Every device that explicit interacts with the ships outside would be placed on a wall (or floor/ceiling), the external part pointing outwards, while you'd have the control panel/ship-system-connection inside.


Imagine the bulkhead-building like the wall-placing from The Sims, except in 3D, with every room being a separate entity.

The Next step would be to fill your modules with every object that's necessary for your ship.

*   the Computers/DCPUs
*   the Reactor
*   Standalone Devices/Sensors
*   stairs, ladders, lights, decorations etc

Everything that needs energy is tied to the bulkhead it's placed in. Turn off the bulkheads energy, and everything inside goes dark as well.

Again, imagine placing objects like it works in The Sims.

Finally, after you've got the ships internal structure sorted out, you can optionally decorate the ships exterior with a hull, basically give your ship a skin. That could be cheap, decorative plastic panels, or actual armor plating that would increase your ships defenses. The Game would take care to prevent you from blocking windows/engines with hull plates, and things like sensors or antennas could be automatically or manually be moved to be on the hull instead of being covered by it.

Imagine the Spore vehicle/spaceship editor, except that you're building something around your modules.

--- **Building superstructures** ---

Another reason for the fixed-angle-restriction is that you can easily build ships that can reliably connect to other ships at multiple points at once, and also can connect to different ships at the same time. The idea behind is to give players the ability to connect many ships together to, for example, form a big space station, or a big spaceship. Every player would remain in full control over his individual ship, especially in regard to things like its engines/tractor beams/computer etc. Every player could control on a per docking-port basis whether to share energy, their computers, or other devices. Two Examples:

*   3 Players combine their ships into one. 
 
  * One of them assumes the role of the navigator/captain, having full computer-guided control over the three sets of engines.
  * The second one would be in control of weapons, of which the more powerful ones could be used because there would be thrice at much energy at disposal.
  * The third one would be in charge of most computers, and can use them to manage communications, calculate enemy weapon trajectories, monitor space etc.


*  Around 20 players form a space station.
 * They could provide a place for other players to park their ships, and get paid for guarding them.
  * Or they could serve as a bank/warehouse for other players.
  * All station systems would have to be centrally connected. Special care would have to be taken to match up every ships thrust vectors for navigation.
  * The high amount of DCPUS would allow for some fancy calculations.
  * Likewise, 20 times the energy would mean you could cover the station in high-energy defense weapons.
  * The players would have to build with redundancy in mind, so that an attack that takes out critical sections wouldn't doom the whole station.
  * Rouge ships, who for example suddenly start their engines while docked and change the course of the station would have to be identified and either disconnected, or steered against to provide neutral thrust.
  * The station would have enormous offensive/Defensive capabilities, but would also be weak against sabotage due to its complexity.

Most of them would not really have a place in the game, but I really think that welding should be in the game to at least some extent. For last minute repairs or making a repair shop on a space station. It could even be extended with the DCPU to make repair drones or automated repair stations.

Soldering would be quite cool too, so you can make your own hardware, of course with boundaries. Even though I don't think this is a realistic goal to set for a game, I still like the idea. But I suppose wiring will function a bit like soldering.

Painting on metal says it all. Good for navigation in big ships, and you can also customize your own ship's exterior.

Some of these suggestions might have been written before, but I really suck at searching for posts on Reddit. :(

But what do you think, would you cut or extend some of these ideas? Maybe scrap them as a whole?



Edit: Let me build a scenario or two, now I have some more time.

Simply imagine a carrier, with let's say 8 small ships, all needing a single pilot. In the hangar of the carrier, there could be two players functioning as the roles of engineers. These players can tweak, overclock, repair and even upgrade parts of the ships very efficiently and fast compared to other players. These tweaks could go for everything from the engine(s) to the weapons. All these tweaks and upgrades could be done to the larger carrier ship too. Even though all the ships would be the same stock fighter, they have all been customized by their pilots, so they can easily identify eachother. 
*While I do fear that this could easily translate to a ""push button, get bacon"" mechanic without mini-games (I don't want to scrap this idea, but I find it far from ideal), I do also think it could give more player roles in multiplayer.*

Another scenario: You just bought a new ship from a player, but aren't quite satisfied with the armor plating around the vital parts of the ship. Being the skilled engineer you are, you equip your welder and begin to weld armor plating onto the ship. While this adds to the total weight of the ship, it adds to it's durability, a price you are willing to pay.",,False,self,t5_2tu92,1351963463.0,,,True,t3_12kd7n,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/12kd7n/using_skills_that_isnt_programming/,

Just a quick update, new version of DevKit can be downloaded from the site, http://0x10c-devkit.com/ .

The app was updated to use some newer tech for the build process, and creating a setup/installer is what pushed things back by a week or two.  So, change of plan, it's a .zip you 
extract somewhere, and it will automatically offer to associate with solution files on startup ;)  You might want to uninstall the old version first.

Some release notes, what's new and changed:

* Now powers http://0x10c-cloud.com/ - some changes under the hood, including solutions having Loadouts in them.  Should have tighter integration in the future!
* Implements the official vector display tech (existing one was a placeholder created a good few months before the official one)
* Implements the official disk drive tech (as above)
* Extra error output when building with dcputoolchain, though see note about version of DTCC used
* Fixed HWI errors found from fuzz testing
* Fixed some backwards compatibility for pre-1.7.5 project building
* Fixed opengl memory problems
* Fixed cycle timer bug
* Can optionally choose to close startup window automatically
* Switched to better error reporting component

I had meant to spend some time today getting the latest DCPUToolchain/C compiler integrated in there, but the docs for getting going with the ""new"" version - well new since I last 
looked about 6 months ago at least! ;) - are down I think (http://dcputoolcha.in/docs / http://dcputoolcha.in/tutorial/index.html ?).  So that will follow.  When that happens, Code Pad on the cloud site will support C too.  Other than that, any problems, let me know, or pop something on the GitHub issues page.

Obviously things have slowed down a fair bit, for 0x10c stuff in general.  With the ""cloud"" site out there and devkit up-to-date, I like to think there's a potential platform for building some cool features and ideas as/when/if anything happens, and without a flurry of new functionality to play with, I figure that's going to be more beneficial focus for energy for the future..

In fact, in general - has anyone else got something cool in the works?  The Toolchain IDE is on the go still right - that started to come together pretty quick last I looked?  libmalp (IIRC) was the idea for a simulated DCPU-driven robot, also sounds fun.  I had the idea for hosting some DCPU processes, or maybe those MALPs for live coding battles or something but couldn't think of an angle to make it compelling..

It would warrant things like kitchens, (massive, inefficient, bulky and rare) food replicators, water treatment plants, etc. It would make the ship seem more alive and less sterile, make co-operative play more challenging due to increased need for food and create a demand for seeds and similar items in-game.

1350224512.0,31,self.0x10c,11glh4,How could hacking work in 0x10c?,lucaspiller,37,6,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/11glh4/how_could_hacking_work_in_0x10c/,"The post about malicious software the other day got me thinking about whether hacking would actually be possible in 0x10c. Sci-fi would have you believe that in order to take over another space ship all you need to do is obtain their (pretty simple) command codes and boom their ship is in your control. I don't think it will quite be as simple as running the 'hack' command from afar and sending an enemy's ship flying into a sun. This is why I think that.

Modern day hacking typically involves finding some sort of vulnerability in a computer system. This is pretty easy as the base operating systems are pretty much all standard. Instead of a bank writing their own, they'll use something off the shelf like Windows Server or Linux. On top of this they'll use an off the shelf database such as MySQL or Oracle. Then, on top of this their bespoke banking application will run. Pretty much all vulnerabilities are in these standard off the shelf systems rather than the bespoke applications running on top of them. The reason why is because hackers have access to this software too, so they can test vulnerabilities on their own machines, then use what they find against a target. Heck, the manufactures of these even tell people what the vulnerabilities are (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2757760) to try to get them to install patches to fix them!

Viruses are similar, in that they take into account known vulnerabilities and expose them. However, rather than a hacker doing something to install them, typically they are installed by an action performed by the user of a target system. Given modern day general purpose computers, running all sorts software from different vendors, it is pretty common to have various security holes in your computer. Most people who get viruses (e.g. your parents :rolleyes:) aren't really that tech savy and don't know that you shouldn't click links offering you £1,000,000, open files from unknown sources, keep your system up to date, etc.

The DCPU will be different though. It won't be running a standardised operating system (you'll probably end up writing it yourself), and it won't be running a multitude of services which talk to the outside world. Apart from most software not being that standardised, I think the size of the programs will be so small that it'll actually be possible to write software without any security vulnerabilities. Without standardised software, hacking won't be anywhere as easy like it is with computer systems today. Oh and I didn't even talk about the networking (or lack thereof) side of things...

So, how could hacking work? I would really like to see it in the game, but I just can't see how it would work. This is my question for you /r/0x10c as I'm pretty stumped. Here are a few things I've come up with, but I don't really think they are that feasible:

* Notch leaves some sort of backdoor into every spacecraft / radio / DCPU / etc. Given that this would be known about pretty quickly, I think it'll be pretty easy to write software (on the DCPU) to work around this.

* A compiler adds some sort of backdoor into every binary (by stephenkall in the other thread)",,False,self,t5_2tu92,False,,,True,t3_11glh4,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/11glh4/how_could_hacking_work_in_0x10c/,

However, these put out signals to everyone, and there may be a group of hungry space pirates listening in on you and your friend's chat about where to store your stash of enriched Einsteinium.  To get secure information, you need some way to make sure your information can't get into the hands of those you don't want it to, at least not in a state that they can read it.

To accomplish that, we have cryptography.  Cryptography is an awesome math thing that uses one-way equations to create a code that can scramble a message ""Hello world"" into ""16B3CD9A880B4FF703"" or something.  Then you also have a code that can unscramble this message, effectively creating a secret language, if you will, between two parties.  With this, even if a bunch of pirates get your code, it's gibberish without the decryption key.

I predict that cryptography will be a necessary part of all serious communications in 0x10c.  It's too important not to have, and too cool for some computer nerds not to make.  Someone has probably already made a crypto program already, actually.

 It would be cool to have a non-keyboard controller, accessible on screen, with a couple of sliders, dials (maybe and x:y pad or two) and a couple of displays, that we could bind functions/vars/scripts to. 

Maybe in terface where we could write a code, for example, that tells the dcpu to set a certain variable, or memory position, to a certain statem depending on the state of a toggle, or we could use a code to tell the controller to light up a lamp on the virtual dash under certain conditions (e.g. the engines stop responding to commands, or if certain doors open). Some degree of customisation would  be nice, so everyone could have a different dash, and one of the perils of hacking someones ship would be working out how to fly the damn thing.

The last idea, which might sound better in my head than out loud, but would be an (optional) ios/android app, that would functions a a touchscreen version of your dash, or a portion of your dash, so you could set up your iphone or ipad next to your keyboard, and be able to set thrusters to 95% drive (or whatever) with a touch of a finger...

* Can you please, please, pick an ID for the M35FD?
* The screen and keyboard documentation files seem to have been removed from dcpu.com/highnerd/rc_1/. Could we please get them back? Also, if possible, the community would really appreciate a centralised place with the most updated docs.
* You've recently stated that there'd be STATE_READING and STATE_READING states for the M35FD. Can we assume 0x0003 and 0x0004, respectively, or should these numbers be something else?
* Some of the members of the community have interpreted your answer on the invalid opcode behaviour [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/115vmc/dcpu16_questions_for_notch/c6jsp18?context=3) as ""when an invalid opcode is encountered, the DCPU catches fire"". It may be a long shot here, but can you elaborate a bit on this?
* A long time ago you mentioned that radiation would be a game mechanic, and in some areas with high radiation the DCPU memory may become corrupt. Is this still in the plans? If so, could you give us some more information on the behavour to help make our emulators more accurate?
* On SirCmpwn's firmware proposal you said that [it gets loaded to the DCPU](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/117tco/revised_firmware_proposal_targeting_experimental/c6kbpax?context=3). Does this mean that you've implemented his spec?

None of my ideas worked however, unless all the gun related button pressing was on a mouse. Then the idea hit me. Why not allow for many of the rudimentary controls for a weapon be regulated to a small ""on board"" computer? Through programming this computer, I feel one should  be able to relegate weapons related tasks to button presses. It would feel a lot fresher and intimate customizing a weapon through a terminal, rather than a ""weapon menu"" (like how everyone else has abused, most recent being Mass Effect.) Depending on the weapon, one could have ""unique"" variables; an example could be that laser weapons could have power outputs modified through code, so you could change laser wattages to barely damage the enemy but maximize battery life (or completely drain the battery in one shot, but possibly turn whoever's at the end of the barrel into a pile of dust). Broader weapon changes like exchanging scopes (if such modifications will exist) could be done through contextual menus, but the more intimate details (like changing the color of the scope reticle) could be done through code. 

So what say you, /r/0x10c? Does it sound like weapons modification through code would freshen the FPS/RPG aspect up a bit, or do I sound like a nut? Let the exchange begin! 

edited: readability, and I tend to ramble. 

another edit: I could see some of these ideas be applied to other ""platforms"" as well, program a robot to ""sip"" power, and it takes forever to do anything, with the benefit of knowing that as soon as you've input directions, all you have to do is place it somewhere and forget it (for instance, you can leave one to mine an asteroid....will do so slowly, but you won't have to visit back for 8 hours game-time.)

A request!: Notch, if you are lurking around, could you shed some insight on hand held weapons for us? Will they have any hardware capable of manipulating through code? If so, have you hammered out any details you'd like to share?

Tenc is a Java (so cross-platform) compiler that compiles a kinda-c-looking language to assembly that can be assembled and run in an emulator.

For example, 

    int main(){
    	int i = 1;
    	return a(1) + i;
    }
    
    int a(int a) {
    	return a * 4;
    }

compiles to 

    SET PUSH, exit
    SET PUSH, exit
    SET PC, func_main
    :exit SET PC, exit
    :func_main
    SET Z, 1
    SET Y, Z
    SET X, Y
    SET I, SP
    SET [I], X
    SET PUSH, 0
    SET I, SP
    SET Z, 1
    SET Y, Z
    SET Z, Y
    SET PUSH, Z
    SET [I], PC
    ADD [I], 3
    SET PC, func_a
    SET Y, Z
    SET A, Y
    SET I, SP
    ADD I, 0
    SET Z, [I]
    SET Y, Z
    ADD A, Y
    ADD SP, 1
    SET PC, POP
    :func_a
    SET I, SP
    ADD I, 0
    SET Z, [I]
    SET Y, Z
    SET Z, 4
    MUL Y, Z
    SET A, Y
    ADD SP, 1
    SET PC, POP

as you can see, it's currently pretty inefficient and also lacks some basic language features, like control flow (if/while/for/goto) and pointers, both of which are coming soon (loops can already be kind of done with recursion, just watch out for overflowing the tiny stack). It's also open-source, so you can hack on it!

[Source + download here](https://github.com/Rotten194/Tenc). There is a pre-compiled jar which can be used from the command line as-is, if you don't have the JDK. I have only tested this on Linux, but there's no reason it shouldn't work on Windows or Mac.

It's the foundation of an OS, with a few commands (seen on the screenshot). The OS itself is a proof of concept, but the standard functions (strcmp, strcat, printnl, newline, printchar...) may be useful for other projects.

Right now, I've got a GitHub repo set up with the code. Feel free to fork it and submit pull requests!

Anyway, documentation for the standard functions:
 
* printnl: Shortcut for ""jsr print, jsr newline"".
* print: It requires a string pointer in register B. Also, it resets the video pointer (A) if it's overflowing. Though we might need to clean the framebuffer, it gets dirty if you overflow.
* printchar: It prints a character (not a pointer to a character) stored in register Y.
* newline: Sets the video memory pointer to the value needed to start a newline.
* strcat: Adds a character (stored in register J) to the string referenced by register B.
* strcmp: Compares two zero-terminated (!) strings, whose pointers are stored in C and X. If the comparison is successful, register Y is set to 1. 0 otherwise.

;Alright, lets talk about what all this means. I know most folks don't understand much about what all this highly specific crap means, but we are going to try and make this as painless as possible. :)
;Please note that I don't consider this finished- I still need to write up the last part, but I would say that all this should be enough for one day.

DCPU-16 Specification Copyright 2012 Mojang Version 1.1 (Check 0x10c.com for updated versions)

""* 16 bit unsigned words"" A word (two bytes) is the smallest unit of memory that can be accessed in this system and collectively have an assigned memory address. Unsigned means that the bit usually reserved for parity (negative or positive) is used instead to double the total amount of positive integers it can potentially hold. 

""* 0x10000 words of ram"" This is the amount of memory your programs can occupy and use for storage. The floppy drives will be slow, and not lend themselves to switching, presumably, so this will be relatively concrete cap on your programs and their data.

""* 8 registers (A, B, C, X, Y, Z, I, J)"" A register is a special word, used by the opcodes for input and output. They reside at a very specific and never changing place in RAM. EDIT: Most of what I thought before is wrong- it appears that there is no preference between any of the registers, and that any will be sufficient for any opcode. Cudos to ismrtn and mrout for this catch.

""* program counter (PC)"" All of the computer's memory is made up of 16 bit words, and each has an address. Like everything, the program you write will be stored as 1s and 0 somewhere in the memory, and as execution of your program advances, the address of the current instruction will have to be remembered by the computer in order to be able to consistently perform the next line of your program, and advance it after. (This is easier understood than explained, and I won't insult your inteligence.) PC is essential for complex or branching programs, because it can be written directly to and this will make your program 'jump' in its execution to a spot other than it otherwise would have, meaning that you can perform some semblance of boolean logic using the four variants of if which are at the end of the opcode list.

""* stack pointer (SP)"" The concept of a stack was way foreign to me when I first learned. This was because it has a very specific structure, one that almost seems formal to the point of impracticality. In a stack, multiple pieces of data have been lined up in memory, with the stipulation that only the last one added can be accessed. Many people relate this to those plate stacks you might see at buffets (dunno if they have these outside the US) that sink down under the weight of all the plates until only the top one shows, and which, upon removal of the top plate, rise to bare the next plate which was, of course, placed on directly before the first one. It's the same with stacks, and the stack pointer keeps track of which plate is on top. When the PUSH command is given, the register specified (I'm not clear if this is required to be A or not) will be copied to the word after the last word on the stack, and the pointer will advance one address to point to the latest addition. Just to be pefectly clear- the stack is stored sequentially in memory, no breaks or gaps. This means that the space it takes up is taken up, and yes it can get too big and overwrite stuff. This should be avoided. :)

""* overflow (O)"" This is what is called a flag- it is set to 0x0001 within the operation of the called function if and when the result of a calculation passes than 65536. Keep in mind that a subtraction underflow will also trigger this, convieniently because 000000000000 or 0 is only one more than 1111111111111 or 65536 because of the behavior of the incrementation 'hardware', which rolls down ones or rolls up zeros, (depending on whether you are adding or subtracting) sequentially from right to left, and when it gets to the end of the number and has more to 'roll', it triggers the overflow flag(regardless of whether or not it was actually an underflow). It will be possible to write routines for the support of larger numbers, though these are unlikely to be neccesary.

""In this document, anything within [brackets] is shorthand for ""the value of the RAM at the location of the value inside the brackets"". For example, SP means stack pointer, but [SP] means the value of the RAM at the location the stack pointer is pointing at."" What Notch is on about is that there is a big difference between a words address in memory, and the value that that word is storing. If the code says SP, for example, then the address that the stack is currently 'stacked to', for lack of a better word, is going to be referenced. However, if the code says [SP], then the value of the word whose address is stored by SP is referenced.

""Whenever the CPU needs to read a word, it reads [PC], then increases PC by one. Shorthand for this is [PC++]. In some cases, the CPU will modify a value before reading it, in this case the shorthand is [++PC]."" This just means that the address of the current instruction is increased every time an instruction is completed, simple stuff really. Sorry to be using line of code and instruction as interchangeble terms- guess that might be confusing to beginners.

""Instructions are 1-3 words long and are fully defined by the first word. In a basic instruction, the lower four bits of the first word of the instruction are the opcode, and the remaining twelve bits are split into two six bit values, called a and b. a is always handled by the processor before b, and is the lower six bits. In bits (with the least significant being last), a basic instruction has the format: bbbbbbaaaaaaoooo"" Note that what I said about PC being incremented by one is a little flexible, as some (few) instructions are longer than others. That's what this says.

Any clarification on these points is welcome.

1. The [M35FD](http://pastebin.com/7wEKhdBx) shares a hardware ID with the [LEM-1802](http://dcpu.com/highnerd/rc_1/lem1802.txt). I know the M35FD spec is incomplete, but this prevents the partial one from being used. I currently use 0x12345678 as the hardware ID, but I'd like some clarification here.
2. [This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/11092i/any_word_on_an_official_disk_specification/c6igzms) introduces the idea of a 60 Hz ""hardware tick"" (as some members of the community have started calling it). How deep does this go? Specifically with respect to the [clock](http://dcpu.com/highnerd/rc_1/clock.txt), it could easily be done through the hardware tick by firing an interrupt every \&lt;value of B when frequency is set&gt; ticks. This would also cause the speed of the clock to change as the CPU speed changes. Is that the case?
3. What is the behavior of the DCPU when an invalid instruction (such as 0x0000) is executed?
4. Will we see the M35FD implement some mechanism to signal when it finishes an operation? Firing an interrupt, having a pollable state, etc...
5. What is the HCF instruction? Does casually mentioning it make it less undocumented? ;)

Players should be able to stab and shoot each other as we have always been able to do in pretty much most video games. The typical health and armor along with different craftable equipment varying in strength should be included.

Programmable weapons and armor would be incredibly badass. Aim correcting guns, power armor, jetpack, DCPU armband with pong on it, the list goes on. Basically the game is halo if you're running around on the floor fighting people, except that someone might ragequit by crashing their ship into your face. If interpersonal combat works this way there are a couple scenarios that I would love to play through.

Like being a space ninja and sneak onto a giant ship using a cloaked pod and sneak the life and valuables out of everyone on board using a space shank leaving the entire structure a ghost ship drifting through space.

Or be a pirate and do forceful invasions of victim ships and just slaughter everyone on board with lasers and space swords then take their loot.

Or Land on a desert planet and set up a large base or fort like structure and have pew pew laser gun wars over the unobtanium mines (although someone might just shove a battle cruiser up the entire base's ass and render pew pew wars useless in comparison).

Well, here's what I did/am doing:

* I learned DCPU assembly.  This part isn't very hard, just try more.  The specs for the cpu are available, and assembly really isn't hard, it just requires a little bit of discipline and organization skills.
* I wrote some basic routines [putc getc readline print newline cls itoa etc] BY MY SELF (aka without just copying someone else's implementation).  If you don't understand how simple functions like that work and are chained together to form larger programs, you'll have trouble further on.
* I read about basic programming structures like null-terminated vs. fixed-length strings and arrays/lists.
* I wrapped those basic routines up into a rudimentary shell.

Try it.  That alone gives you the basics to make an 'OS' for the DCPU.  Try creating a file system and a directory structure to use with the MFD floppy device.  Or create an object format for the SPED display and a routine to display it, and start creating ships and objects to display.

Nobody really knows what to do.  Someone is porting Unix, someone else rickrolled me the other day with a DCPU program, another person is writing a multi-tasking OS.

What would you want your ship to do for you?

I'm working on real 32-bit math, floating point, and a graphical console for my DCPU (not a command-based shell.)

I heard notch didn't hard limit how many DCPU-16 we will be able to hold, but he said something about 3 per ship being a reasonable number.
But also notch said we would be able to land seamlessly on planets and to play games while holding some large mining operations.

This makes me ask something: Are we *only* able to hold DCPU-16 in our ships or can we have DCPU-16 computers down there on the planets? If this is possible, should we really keep thinking about clusters and multi-processor computers?

If that's so, wouldn't we be able to build stationary starbases and planetary bases with many, many computers to be able to properly communicate and transmit information throughout the multiverse? (just like Starfleet Command, of United Federation of Planets in Star Trek).

Also, regarding the limit, shouldn't it be proportional to the ship size? I mean, if I'm building a small vessel like X-Wing, one reactor and maybe 1 DCPU-16 should be fine. If I'm building Enterprise, capable of holding more than 400 crew members, maybe 3 DCPU-16 wouldn't be enough. If we are able to *actually* build our ships, I think size and capacity should be crucial modifiers on generators and DCPU-16 number limits.

For those who don't know much about Torque it's been around for a few years. If you're familiar with Marble Blast Ultra, Blockland, or Tribes 2 you may know that all of them were created in Torque. It's perfectly capable of making commercial quality games, and more features are added with every release.

For those interested in making 0x10c more like a MMO you'll be happy to know that Torque is big on networking and always has been.

Sorry if I sounded like a salesperson, but I'm really into open source projects and I think that this game would be greatly benefited by an already established engine.

My points

* Less engine work for programmers (compared to writing from scratch)
* Torque3D is completely open source
* Two communities benefit and the open source community as a whole grows

The closest I can get to something that looks feasible is to borrow from the Motorola or the MIPS handbook, and either use a panoply of bus states, along with additional bus lines, or an entirely seperate set of buses for the hardware interface. Either way, bus enumeration and subsequent bus activity will either require a very complex state machine or microcode.

And the attached hardware, like the display unit and the keyboard, will either require their own state machine or microcontroller just to manage the interface. The keyboard state machine should be simple enough. More complex hardware would be expensive and resource intensive to implement because of the need to have extra resources to manage the bus interface.

And I'll be damned if I can figure out the interrupt queueing without a ton of microcode and an external memory space, or expensive dedicated space on the die.

He wore a white short sleeved dress shirt and his hair was combed over to the side.  It had a slight sheen to it, hair product most likely.  He cleared his throat as he shifted uncomfortably in the very hot office.

This was Harvey Aldrich.  And the office wasn't hot at all, you see.  He was just nervous.  He had worked his entire life to get to this moment.  He had spent countless hours of pouring over books and drafting designs, his genius was either about to be recognized by one of the most prestigious space exploration agencies in the world, or he was going to spend the rest of his life designing bridges.

There was 'nothing wrong with designing bridges' his mother constantly reminded him, and for the most part he agreed.  But, out there among the stars.  That's where he belonged.  He knew it with every fiber in his being.  Even if he ended up with a mundane job out there... he was still there.  In outer-space!

A single bead of sweat escaped his hairline and traced its way down his temple.  It settled when it had reached the collar of the shirt he had ironed three times before this interview.

""Let's see,"" The old man broke the uncomfortable silence, ""Do you know a Dr. Powler?""

""Um, yes.  He was a professor at Stanford during my stay there.""

""And you studied under him, correct?""

Harvey knew where this was going.  Dr. Powler, his former professor and mentor, had recently been accused under suspicion of aiding the USSR's space program.  Claims were that he designed the pods that now housed Russian Cosmonauts on the moon's surface.  It was strategically dotted with them.  The moon, unofficially of course, belonged to the Soviets.

""That is correct.""

The man looked back to his paper, ""And you two were close?""

Harvey hesitated.  Were his chances at following his dreams really going to be destroyed by the potential political alignment of a professor he hadn't seen in over half a decade?

""I was his Teaching Assistant for two semesters while studying the design of-""

""That isn't what I asked.,"" The man cut him off, ""Look, if we're going to trust you you're going to need to be upfront with us.""

""We were close,"" Harvey replied curtly, ""But, that was years ago.  I was not aware of, nor did we discuss anything other than our work.""

""So, you're familiar with his theories concerning gravity manipulation?"" The man asked.

""Yes, I worked closely with him on a project concerning gravity manipulation.  It yielded no conclusive results.  He, I mean *we* found no indication that his theories were anything but hopeful conjecture.""

The old man slid the paper back into the folder and scooted his chair back.  As he stood from his desk he extended a hand towards Harvey offering a handshake.

""They were more than that.  That's why we need you.  Welcome aboard, son.""

**Inside The Little White Rectangle**

It was as dark on the inside as it was on the outside.  Darker in fact.  That is until several small lights blipped on.  They blinked silently for a few minutes before the whirring of computer drives started up.  A few clicks, a whining sound, and several high-pitched beeps were followed by florescent lights clicking on one at a time.

The first revealed a chair in front of a large computer console.  Three monitors flipped on.  The green text was hazy at first but slowly got clearer.  A large glass window sat directly in front of the control station.  It was currently covered by a large, retractable radiation shield made of about 3 inches of metal.

The second light clicked on.  The new source of light revealed a door to a lavatory and a compact kitchen area.  The floor was made out of a cushioned, pristine white material.  The walls were a matte steel finish.

The third light flickered a few times before making up its mind.  When the dull light finally illuminated the area all that was to be seen was a space suit next to an airlock door.

The fourth and final light came on.  A relatively bare space presented itself.  A table lay in the center.  It had a stainless steel frame and the top of it was encased in an opaque glass.  A few blue lights on the inside of the case displayed a human form lying on the table.

All in all, the craft was not all that impressive.  It measured 56 feet long and 12 feet wide on the interior.  Hardly an imposing vessel by anyone's standards, but it was a miracle of modern science.  Was.

The computer console ticked and whirred furiously for a moment.  The central monitor was filled with numbers and letters scrolling by at an extremely fast rate before going black again.  Then, one letter at a time a message appeared.

how about this idea, ""logging out"" is in the game world means activating a device that stores all the information of your ship and converts you and it into a special collapsed form of sub-atomic particle.

what this means? your undetectable, untouchable, ect... your not there anymore effectively... the one downside is that this process takes about 2-3 minutes IRL to do... (scanning and storing the information about your ship.

so you might be asking where your ship appears when you log in?

well your a sub atomic particle, so you have to obey quantum physics (or close enough to fit in with the game, you don't want to spawn inside a planet)

when you spawn you have a probability to spawn anywhere within the orbital pattern you became part of, (which is determined by the total energy of your ship when you logged out.)

and as part of the device you decide the shape of the orbital you join, within energy constraints...

also you have to be in orbit around something to log out.

* For Android: [TouchOSC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hexler.touchosc&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm5ldC5oZXhsZXIudG91Y2hvc2MiXQ..)

We live in a world where the economy is kind of taken for granted.  We have banks, money, business, and government.  We are born into it, and it's what we are used to.  But in 0x10c, which is basically a bunch of people waking up in a deserted universe, there is no economy.  No banks, no money, only resources.  So what happens here?

* Maybe people simply barter.  ""Hey, dude I have too much hydrogen, give me some of your food supplies and you can have half"".  Might work, but then you have the problem when you want to barter, but you or the other guy doesn't have the thing you need.  Maybe an item with a constant demand (value) could be used as a type of ""currency"" eg water, oxygen, fuel, etc).

* Maybe people will cling to old ways, and try to recreate the old economy.  How would that work... perhaps people would have their own ""private banks"" running on their DCPU in the same way that banks work today (mostly digital).  That would also leave open the possibility of hacking, and give rise to the importance of digital security...

* Or maybe people will find another way, some new, more advanced economy, not held back by the established ways of the old society.  There are plenty of examples of theoretical future economies, post-scarcity, etc.

I guess the main point of this post is; I don't want there to be an economic model already established by the game.  If the economy is created by the players, we could have a much richer experience with possibilities of multiple economies, created, collapsed or outgrown as the players see fit.

I'm working on a simple server application that can accept client connections and map them on an internal 2D plane/grid, and cause interference between clients data by 'distance' on the grid...pretty much emulating a Signal to Noise ratio that is enforced by the middleman.  Your X,Y coordinates are never exposed, so you're left to your own devices to locate anyone else.  There is only a socket, no protocol.  Anything transmitted by one client will be received by all other clients (perhaps mixed in with other sending clients' data too) based on how close you are to the other players.  There are also measurable delays (read: the dcpu is fast enough to process simple triangulation) when communicating with nearby/far players.

Instead of sharding or realms or channels the proximity system handles privacy and spam and such neatly.

What are everyones thoughts on having an opcode reserved especially for debuggers to recognize as break points in a program.

When executing without a debugger, the instruction is simply skipped, however a debugger will be able to recognize that opcode, and pause execution.

The reason it's important that an opcode for this is reserved in the official DCPU spec is to ensure a couple of things:

* All Debuggers have a standard to follow, instead of a different opcode (or breakpoint method) for each debugger
* Ensuring that the opcode isn't later used in the DCPU spec.

A real world counter-part to this opcode would be INT 3. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_(x86_instruction)#INT_3)

INT 3 has it's own opcode, 0xCC, in x86. My suggestion for the opcode would be one of the 'reserved for future expansion' (in the special opcodes section of the spec). Another option would be to use one of the special opcodes, such that debug information can also be passed from the running program to the debugger through the single argument that special opcodes receive.

Hi everyone, I do regular live streams of DCPU development.

This weekend I'm looking at doing a 'DCPU Assembler From Scratch' live stream, starting out with basic concepts of DCPU programming and moving on from there. I will be following the tutorial hosted on 0x10command (http://0x10command.com/dcpu-assembly-tutorials/), giving viewers a chance to ask questions about any parts they aren't understanding.

(Small note: It appears some of the information in those tutorials is out of date).

Also if anyone knows of another set of tutorials, let me know.

I haven't yet chosen a time to do the live stream, so if you're interested in tuning in, please reply here with a time / day (Saturday or Sunday) that you'd find it convenient to view the livestream at (include your timezone! (or better yet, give it to me in GMT+0) ), and I'll try schedule it around a time that most people can tune in.

In the mean time, you can view my stream at http://www.twitch.tv/madmockers (when it's live, that is).

I was thinking about what 0x10c could do about Carriers. Big ships with automated guns, and small-fighter bays. 

A group of 5 to 20 players could move their power supplies to a mobile gun platform with fighter bays and a large stock of rechargeable batteries. 

One captain could maintain the carrier while the fighters go off and run hit-and-run fire until the burn out a battery, drop into the bay, switch out batteries, and get back into battle. 

This could mean for a pretty good excuse to have boarding battles. On modern naval battles, a boarding party is unheard of. If an aircraft even comes close to a flight deck without a good transceiver, it gets cut to shreds. Space battles like Star Wars: Battlefront 2's boarding parties are absolutely absurd. There is no reason a foreign spacecraft should be able to land safely in an enemy ship.

In 0x10c, however, you could give boarding craft short range teleporters (we can teleport through 4d space, so why not?) Instead of letting people teleport from capital ship to capital (could be problematic for balance), a small strike craft that could leach onto a ship could teleport crew through a single bulkhead (eliminating the need to ""cut"" a bulkhead; and all the code/art to make that work).

So what I'm thinking is why don't we write a very tiny C compiler that compiles a subset of C for the DCPU, and write this compiler ONLY in this subset.

Now what are the advantages of this approach?

The compiler would be small enough to run on the DCPU itself, maybe around 50-100 kb TOPS, leaving in the worst case 155kb working memory. This should be enough for the compiler to compile itself on the DCPU.

So what we could do is use the LLVM project to compile this small compiler that compiles a subset of C for the DCPU, and use this optimized compiler to compile other programs on the DCPU.

You could:

Write C code and compile it in-game.
Port existing interpreters with significant memory optimizations to the DCPU. (Say Lua without an interpreter, VM only to execute bytcode)

Then I had an idea, what if cloaking fields acted as an event-horizon around your ship, making it impossible for anything including light to escape? That provides a neat explanation for how your ship is invisible to other players, and prevents cloaked players from teleporting (or whatever) to your ship without dropping the cloak.


It could also be used to trap other players on your ship, who'd then have to either hack your DCPU or destroy the cloaking generator to escape.

So far, we've seen that the player can fall downwards perpendicularly to the ship's floor.  This leads us to believe that there is a force keeping the player on the ground.  We can assume 1 of 3 things:

1)  The ship accelerating upwards.  While there is a possibility that there are rocket thrusters constantly accelerating the ship upwards in respect to the floor, this seems unlikely, as there has been no visible change in the ship's view of the outside (the planets in the videos Notch has released were not starting to fly out of view downwards).  Thus, this is not very likely.

2)  The ship is actually ring-shaped, is spinning, and is exerting apparent centrifugal force on the outside.  Since we haven't seen this in the architecture of the ships OR the outside view, this is improbable too.  Which leaves us with only one really good explanation:

3) SCIENCE.  Or witchcraft.  Anyways, engineers from the 80's somehow managed to create localized gravity field generator, which is part of the ship.  This somehow bends spacetime to pull you down to the floor of the ship, but not make the ship do weird physics stuff that might come with distorting the fabric of space and time (such as imploding, disintegrating, warping into higher dimensions, etc.)

So basically you never die and neither does your ship. I really dislike this. The respawning of the player is fine, it can be done like EVE's with the whole pod system, but I really dislike that your ship is respawned as is. A huge part of games like these that many people love is the thrilling experience that you can lose your ship and you risk it all the time. It's what makes battles intense and fulfilling.

Edit: Also I'm talking about your physical ship, not the character. You could retain software or something, like in a pod, similar to how EVE retains your skill points and such, but your ship is ultimately destroyed.

What my approach would be since this is a hard scifi approach to the game:

You have a ship that you own, you have software and whatnot that you own and use on the ship, and whatever else belongs to you, lets say skill points for hypothetical sake. These are 'bound' to your character, you don't lose them when your ship is destroyed. Ships should be destroyed, it makes sense with the hard scifi theme and hell, even the looting feature that is planned. You can salvage and loot ships and so on. However, when you die, your character respawns with all your software and whatever else. You'd perhaps have a pod somewhere where you respawn in with your stored consciousness and stored backup of your software, which you will always keep, but your physical ship is destroyed. This fits in with the hard scifi approach to the game, the mere respawning of ships doesn't and quite frankly is very unappealing.

What's your opinion? Perhaps this is something that can be reconsidered, it's one of the planned features of the game I don't like.

I'm thinking about how we want to shape the overall in game culture. I like EVE Online in that players can be mean nasty pirates, but it seems like anything interesting that happens in the game is from players being mean and nasty. Part of the reason I quit was that outside of the ""secure"" industrial gameplay it seemed like everyone was mean and nasty in game.

I think part of this is that the important civilized side of the game is hard coded and not created by the players. They have no vested interested in protecting their gate system or the large market stations because they are hardcoded to never be destroyed. Anything players create only benefit the player or their corp/alliance.  There is no global utility. There are some exceptions (ISS and CVA back in the day), but overall destroying another player's work has no negative effect on the attacker. 

I strongly believe that there is a place for that in 0x10c, but we also have the opportunity to create a space for players willing to build up something together. It would be nice if there was just as much news about massive pirate attacks as there is about creating an elaborate market.

One way we can do that is by creating an in game culture were certain actions results is widespread shock and outrage (this is where the role players help shape the world, even if people like me are not interested in rping). 

Babylon 5 had hyperspace jump gates. Even if a race was at war with another it was an unthinkable atrocity to destroy their hyperspace gates.  It would make everyone turn against them. In 0x10c, assuming we can build space stations with dcpus, I can see us building a galaxy wide internet with space stations housing chat servers, auction servers, and navigation databases with relay stations and satellites bringing the network to all corners of the galaxy. 

Attacking and destroying these could be an unthinkable action.

Notch is now seemingly very tight lipped with his updates here and his interaction kept to a minimum. We used to get lots of comment interaction and also regular live streaming to keep us interested.

If it wasn't for Eldrone I would think this project was abandoned. More so because Notch is renowned in my eyes for loosing interest and getting bored.

Even if it ever does see the light of day I am deeply worried we will one Christmas encounter the evil snow-golum empire.

On a serious note, why has it all gone quiet?

In 0x10c though we have a little more back story than that. We know that the setting is a nearly dead universe and that people and ships have been preserved through it in stasis pods. given the extra time traveling at a breakneck speed through the universe its a wonder we didn't hit something.. anyway.. 

so we know we got here through statis sleep. but are we sitting aboard a fully kitted ship ready to arrive at whatever destination was planned at departure? this implies the computers were installed and programmed to do something BEFORE you left earth which means software already on your computer. or have we been intercepted and woken before the timer ran out? that could leave us waking up with nothing and in the custody of some npc. maybe we wake up during the destruction of our ship as it pulled into some blackhole or plunges into a star and we find ourselves in sort of a tutorial where we make a dash for the escape pod.. leaving us with nothing.. 


My point is Notch hasn't really set down the conditions of our situation during the first couple hours of gameplay which leaves us a lot of room to speculate wildly for our own personal amusement.

Personally, I'm really hoping he doesn't ""cut corners"" to make it an easier/simpler game to play.
I understand the need to keep the playerbase open, but I would be seriously disappointed if Orbital Mechanics weren't considered or applied.
I don't want to be able to point my ship at a planet and arrive there after burning for some time.
I want Hohmann transfers, retro-burns, normal/anti-normal vectors to work.

If you can't tell, I come from KSP. I think they did a wonderful (if not near perfect) job of making a Rocket Science game playable by a non-Rocket Scientist without dumbing it down. Period.

Yes, you have to learn quite a bit to be succesful, but that's what makes it rewarding/satisfying.
I'd prefer this game to have a slight ""elitist"" feel to it. As in you have to actually know what you're doing to succeed.

I'm not saying you aren't allowed to play if you don't know anything about it.
But a game that educates while you play is great. It's something I highly respect Monkey Squad for doing, even if by accident.

Unfortunately, it's not that simple. I'd be very surprised if Notch made transmissions infini-distance, so wireless transmissions would only be able to travel so far. In the real world, this is fine because everything is stationary (or at least within close proximity to a stationary router) and routers are able to maintain tables of who their neighbors are. In this world, that wouldn't happen because nothing stands still in space, so those neighbors will constantly change.

That doesn't, however, mean we can't try to propose a way to extend communications as much as possible. For this, I propose we invent a new type of packet. Basically, this packet is going to have a header containing four things. The first will be a couple bits just to allow other ships to recognize it is a packet, the second and third will be standard destination and source address, and the last will be a random value between 0 and 255 (half of a word, so we can have some kind of identifier in the next 8 bits that let the machine know the data is starting). In the footer, we *might* add a simple checksum because everything is wireless, and I'd say we limit everything in between (the data) to 100 words as to not overload processors.

As far as routing goes, I think the only thing we'd actually be able to implement is a kind of rudimentary system of wireless switches. Basically, in order to use a program that makes use of this packet, you would need a daemon on one of your CPUs that functions as a router (though this could probably be integrated into another program; that's why it's so simple). Any messages received with the starting bits identifying it as a packet will be re-transmitted in all directions, very little thinking involved. If the ship is the receiving end, the daemon won't forward the packet. Afterwards, it'll check for data integrity (if we have some way to check that in the footer), de-capsulate the packet to remove the identifier (saying it's a packet) and the footer, and pass it to any CPUs/programs on board the ship that have signaled they are looking for packets.

The more technologically advanced of you will probably notice the huge flaw in this idea. Taking into consideration everything I explained, the system would be INCREDIBLY prone to routing loops. Packets would also never die. To solve this, we have the routing daemon check everything but the data of the packet, and store the information about each packet into a temporary table along with a timer. These values will decay over a certain amount of time, but while they are in the table, and packet with identical characteristics (including random value) will be thrown out to enable a kind of split horizon system. 

Security, obviously very unsecure in this iteration of the idea, would really be the job of the program receiving individual packets. There are few restrictions on data, so that should be able to be encrypted easily. At the same time, while standards for addressing could probably be very useful (and maybe it'd be nice to implement a kind of MAC address to use as an IP for completely unique identifiers if Notch adds that functionality to the ships) at the moment addressing is very relaxed to allow for manipulation based on what a particular program needs. Maybe it's a chat service, and rather than sending a message to each individual participant, the chat room designates a random broadcast address that's sent out to chatters and kept track of by the clients to ensure only one transmission has to be sent out for each message.

Let's start with propellantless, energy-based engines:

**Alcubierre drive (Warp Drive)** Warp drive is a theoretical concept that would be physically possible. It working contracting space-time in front of it and expanding space-time behind it. The cool thing about this is the rules of special relativity do not apply since the ship would be stationary within a ""warp bubble"" between the warped space-time. Scientists have theorized that it could be accomplished by expanding the 11th dimension in front of the ship and shrinking it behind the ship creating dark energy. http://news.discovery.com/space/warp-drive-spaceship-engine.html This is a fairly decent explanation of how warp drive would work.

**Field Drives** Field drives are another cool type of ""engine"". These are not dissimilar to the warp drive except instead of contracting and expanding space-time it folds space time to create a sort o artificial gravity field. This can be done in a few ways, the diametric drive, for example would have an artificial positive mass in front of the ship and an artificial negative mass behind the ship creating negative gravity - a pushing force - behind it and positive gravity - a pulling force in front of it. There are types of field drives you can read about here: http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/bpp/1997-J_AIAA_SpaceDr.pdf These field drives would of course not be superluminal.

Now let's look at energy sources, Notch said that it would be a fixed amount of energy and we would not need fuel. Now I would say that leaves us with solar power, but that may be tricky in a dying universe:

**Zero-Point Energy** Zero-point energy is a controversial subject that borders on pseudo science but recently there have been promising breakthroughs. Zero-point energy is the idea of harnessing the background energy fluctuation that exists everywhere. if you were to remove everything from the universe there would still be resonant energy known as ""quantum vacuum energy"" that would still exist. The amount of energy that exists in this ""quantum vacuum"" is huge (10^36 to 10^70 J/m^3) and if we can tap into even a fraction of it, we could probably power a warp drive. There is more info at these links: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy
http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050170447_2005172301.pdf (pg 65)

This sort of energy source could be used to explain just about any piece of technology that require much more energy than achievable today.

**TL;DR** Much of the technology that would need scientific explanation can be easily explained through warp drive, field drives, and Zero Point Energy

**Edit:** As [GreyTheory](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/sih6t/scientific_explanations/c4eio7p) pointed out, these scientifically valid hypotheses and not true ""explanations"" for the futuristic technology.

It this possible? Once Notch defines radio specs (and defines range limitations and such), could we have a internet-like system? Maybe using a relay network of some kind? Will the game support space stations running their own DCPU? 

I assume we'd probably end up coming up with our own web-standard (because HTML would be a horrible idea for the screen we have). We'd have to write a browser and a server (but that doesn't seem TOO hard once radio specs are up). Getting a relay system to work might be a challenge, since basically we'd be created a 16bit IP standard from scratch (right?).

So, is this a horrible idea filled with security flaws, or the best way to communicate and distribute software to beyond the stars?

What game features would we need to make this kind of thing more plausible? Space Station Relays? Binary Radios (computer communication, not just voice chat)? Long Range Coms (limited bandwidth)?

My understanding of what 0x10c should look like in the end is limited, so help me understand if this is a dumb idea.

If I'm counting correctly, that's a 128 x 96 pixel screen, allowing 32 x 12 characters. That's way too low, IMHO. You can't do all that much with a screen that small.

For comparison, [here's a Commodore 64 screenshot from 1982](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/C64_startup_animiert.gif/260px-C64_startup_animiert.gif).

Being a huge fan of both space MMOs and low level programming I'm extremely excited at the thought of 0x10^c and the possibility of programming a fleet of ships with a ""swarm"" behavior.  We of course do not know many of the smaller details of the game as it is likely that Notch has not even thought that far ahead, but I believe we know enough to start making plans.  I'm looking for feedback on my rough plan below and I'm mostly looking for flaws that I have overlooked.


Assumptions (Notch has not explicitly stated any of this but based on what he seems to be going for I'm thinking):

* The DCPU will be able to control most/all ship systems
* There will be some form of networking possible between DCPUs on the same ship
* DCPUs will be able to access some sort of comm system, allowing some form of collaboration between ships.
* Comm systems will be inherently insecure, both in that anyone can listen in to your messages and possibly spoof messages.
* There will be DCPU accessible telemetry data (probably just ships/other large objects but if we're lucky we'll be able to get data on projectiles)
* Power will be a very limiting factor on ships, it will not be possible to have weapons firing with shields up (will there be shields?) while running 3+ DCPU and maneuvering etc.

If all these hold true then I believe a swarm strategy is the best way to go.

**Fleet Design**

Drone - Ideally I will come up with a nice balanced ship hardware design that I can mass produce that will be capable of both combat and economic roles to support fleet expansion. If such a ship build is not practical then they will be solely combat ready with a separate subfleet for economic purposes.  They will be capable of basic automation that can be overridden by the command ship which will designate targets.

Command Ship - This is where I will be, it will be as heavily armored/defended as possible and also hold as many DCPUs as I can reasonably fit in one ship without sacrificing defenses.  Early versions will likely have weapon systems when my swarm is small but they can be removed later to accommodate the bank of DCPUs that will be required to control a large swarm of drones.

**Communications**
Secure comms are vital for this to work, some form of rotating/time seeded encryption on comm packets will be essential.  Other options would be implementing some custom form of public key/private key authentication.  Most communication would be from Command -&gt; drone.  Possible exceptions are drones responding to a status request or other specialized ships reporting back with telemetry or other data.  Adding this to the fact that I plan program the system myself I believe it is reasonable to expect my comms to remain secure.

**Upgrades**
My fleet will be constantly evolving, and I doubt that I will be content to simply grow my numbers.  Unfortunately I don't see any way to reasonably expect transmitting firmware updates to each ship over comms to be secure so I expect to have to board each ship with a floppy. This will likely be a very time consuming process so it will not happen often.

**Ship Damage**
This, as surprising as it may sound, is what worries me the most about the viability of my plan.  I think it is unlikely that automated repairs will be possible and I'm not sure of the frequency of repairs or how urgent they will be.  This may be one of the biggest limiting factors on crewless ships.

**Drone Design**

* As I said before drones will be as cheap as possible, while still being cost effective.
* Assuming 3 DCPUs per ship I will have the main computer, which will control weapon firing and other offensive actions.  It will have 2 states automatic and under orders from the command ship.  If under orders (simple, such as fire at the designated coordinates or move to a location) and if orders are not received it will revert to automatic. Under automatic it will automatically aquire what it deems to be enemy targets and fire otherwise just hanging near other friendlies.  This will be useful if comms are disrupted for any reason. (ship damage or some sort of comm jamming/overload).  
* 3d movement and targeting calculations require a lot of heavy math, so that is why the 2nd DCPU will be dedicated entirely to math.  It will primarily be utilizing lookup tables but will also be able to do various custom batch calculations (such as determining nearby hostiles from telemetry data, or) It will free up the requesting machine to do other tasks while it waits for the results back.  
* The 3rd DCPU will be the machine responsible for things outside the ship, primarily comms, telemetry, and raising defenses if an immanent threat is detected.  Additionally, the other 2 DCPUs will be setup to trigger a self destruct if access to the comms DCPU is lost for more than a small preset time.  This is because access to my source would be a major security risk as a big part of my security will be through the uniqueness of it and the source being unavailable.

**Command Ship Design**

* This is where I will reside in my fleet, this is an obvious risk but I will only have such a ship if extremely heavy armor/sheilding is possible.
* The following dcpu/terminals are listed in the order of importance, I do not expect to be able to have all of them and the ones lower in the list will be integrated into others if possible.
* Main computer, this is where all direct control over the ship will happen and where I will be able to manually fly the ship as well as designate orders to my drones.  When I am not actively controlling it, it is capable of giving basic orders to drones to keep the fleet cohesive. Not much will be running here as I need it to be as responsive as possible.
* Comms/telemetry, recieves orders from the main computer to send out to drones as it's primary goal.  Also handles all telemetry and any information flowing in and out of the ship.
* Math DCPU, same as in the drones but might even need 2 this time.  I expect massive amounts of objects to process all of which need to be analyzed in 3dimensional space.
* My workstation, for me to tink with and prepare code to use everywhere else.  Won't be powered on all the time if that would cause any issues but I think a dedicated machine to experiment on while not disrupting important machine's functions is very important.
* ""Cyber Warfare"" station, in it's passive state it will just be collecting comms traffic of other ships. I will be monitoring all community program's and I will try to have methods to compromise the copied software that most ships will be running ready if possible. Might possible make a way for it to cycle through various ""hacks"" automatically if I tell it to?  Hacking a new system in the middle of battle is not realistic but using this machine I plan to have as many premade hacks ready to fly at the touch of a button.
*Database, hopefully we will have largish (MB range) storage possible and this is where I will try to have as much as possible.  This DCPU will get data feeds from all other sources I can get for centralization/display.  Will hopefully have this hooked up to a display so that I can have it passively focus on displaying it in a meaningful way.

My idea works on the basis of a radar system. Everyone's radar can pick up larger objects from greater distance, while small objects can only be detected in a small distance. Makes sense.

Small ships (presumably less powerful) will be able to avoid contact with larger ones because of the radar detection range. Larger ships on the other hand, will have to pick fights with enemies closer to their own size.

Of course, the concept only works if the size of ships roughly equal their power. It would have to be expensive if not impossible to get ship parts that are powerful for the space they take up.

I have some priorities that I think we should establish now so we can function in the multiverse:

* People were saying they didn't want to have a huge alliance for redditors, because games like EVE are more fun without them. But, almost everyone agreed that we should have some sort of guild to protect newbies. Well, when the first explorers begin to wake up from deep sleep, we'll *all* be newbies. I think for the first week or so everyone should work together to establish alliances and an economy (more on that later).

* A chat network. I'm pretty sure Notch won't be putting any ship-to-ship chat in the game, so when the first players log in and wake up, no one will be able to communicate with each other. Baked into the 0x42c OS and any other OS thats released for the DCPU-16, there needs to be ONE kind of chat software, so everyone who's read up on the game can communicate right when they install the OS on their first ship's computer. An evolution of this would be an email client and server.

* An economy. Sure, trading goods is great, but an economy with money can be better. It would be less confusing, and all the materials could have a value in the currency, so conversion can happen. I suggest Trillek for the name of the currency if thats not how it turns out you pronounce 0x10c.

* With a currency, you can set up a banking system, so people can transfer money to each other and borrow money from the bank, and earn intrest on their money. I think that the person who writes the banking software will be very wealthy in-game.

If we start these projects early, then hopefully no one will have a chance to start up a competing standard, and at least for the first week of play or so everyone will be on the same page.",,False,self,t5_2tu92,False,,,True,t3_rxs4s,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/rxs4s/we_need_to_set_up_some_priorities/,

Just wanted to add that I hadn't been clear enough that:

1. Yes, you would be able to turn, using side propulsion designed for rotating and positioning the craft

2. Yes, you would be able to accelerate / decelerate, but it would be very, very gradual, so not a core thing you would use all the time

---

Based on Eld's mockup here: http://i.imgur.com/akByX.jpg I wanted to make the following observation. This is not necessarily crticism (it's too early), just a point to really think about.

**Acceleration:**

The ship out the window has its engines lit, it would not need to do this unless it were accelerating (assuming that it is another player's ship); this would not be very realistic if we consider what kind of space ships these are and for what purpose they were built: let's examine this train of thought:

Any spaceship designed for intersteller travel where by the passengers would be necessitated to go into suspended animation would not be any kind of 'agile' space fighter. Technology wise, it would be cheapest and safest for these kind of long-haul ships to be built in orbit, equiped with a slow-acceleration drive that would use minimal fuel (such as an ion drive). These types of propulsion systems cause the ship to accelerate incredibly slowly, but continuously, such that the ship can eventually reach the incredible speeds needed to cover the distance. Burning a ton of a fuel for a short time simply isn't going to get you fast enough.

Therefore, it makes absolutey zero sense to design these ships *to ever have to stop*. All that time and fuel spent building up speed should never, ever be wasted (that's just bad engineering). Instead the ship would be designed to never slow down (under it's own power), but instead use orbital mechanics to slow down and enter the orbit of the destination, then use the local star as a slingshot to speed up again on the exit. Efficient long-haul flight would therefore not provide the flexibility needed to ""dog fight"" in space. These ships are big, designed for maximum efficiency of travel and have a turning circle measured in AUs.

Therefore, for combat situations, it makes much more sense for these types of ships to have two forms of offence and defence:

1. Long range lasers and a small stash of missles for sea-style battles where the large ships position each other parallel to the other and hope for the best outcome, knowing that both will take direct hits

2. Docked to the ship would be one or more small combat fighter ships that the player could jump into and use to dogfight in space (this could be a DCPU of its own). These ships would be tiny (like a WWII fighter plane), have limited range (powered by batteries, charged from the main ship's generator), but loaded with the best weapons. (this is also how you would land on a planet, or board other ships)

(The spaceship outside the window in Eld's mockup image could of course be construed to be just such a fighter ship, but I just wanted to elaborate on the idea.)

So, note that what I am propsing (for the sake of ""hard"" science), is that the main craft that the player occupies has *no ability to accelerate or deccelerate* other than through orbital mechanics. Fighting is done mostly pirate-style or dogfighting with any combat ships available. It does not make sense to me to have a jack-of-all trades ship that is for long-haul in empty space, but at the same time, can turn on a dime in a combat situation; it lacks the risk and excitement of knowing that your ship is large, travelling incredibly quick and cannot just loop-de-loop and escape at the drop of a hat. Every encounter with an enemy is potential death and there will almost never, ever be a time where you come away unscathed by any combat situation.

It is a game of survival and in any combat, everybody loses to differing degrees. If your main ship is destroyed whilst you are in combat in a fighter ship, then your last ditch hope for survival is to board the enemy and take their ship single-handed, Ace Rimmer style.

 * PK crypto system for communicating over Notch's proposed Hyperverse implimentation of UDP to comm with BBSs.

 * *fast* symmetrical system would be fun.

 * A fast steam cipher

I was thinking DES originally but now that I think about it, a reduced round blowfish would be better. 


What I know of the DCPU-16 is it has 1 Megabit of ram and will be somewhere around 100-200Khz. So if we do this we have to make it *tight*. 

The symmetrical cipher I propose is Blowfish. It is the fastest cipher I know of that is still recommended for use without hardware acceleration. The number of rounds I propose for Blowfish is 5-7 rounds and a 64bit key. A 32bit key is way to easy to be bruteforced by a home computer. I do not know what block mode to use, most likely ECB to keep computation time down.


The stream cipher could be the same as above but using CFB(Cipher Feedback), but my book only covers doing this with DES.


I think doing PK crypto on this will be balls to the walls. We definitely can't use RSA. I would like to keep the keys under 100 bits yet a 100bit RSA key is factorable in hours. In addition whatever PK crypto we choose will also have to do double duty to sign messages. 


In addition to the normal crypto concerns we would have to do significant memory management. I haven't found anything on if there will be external storage emulated or if everything has to fit in 1MB, but we also have to deal with realtime computation concerns. For example if the system causes a halt, someone could crash into an asteroid or be blown up by pirates. If our programs takes to many cycles it could slow down course corrections leading to the same fate, or cause power management to degrade, etc. 


Does anyone want to chime in on their thoughts about the crypto choices I have made? There are still many choices to make but I think it would be very fun to do this! What about additional information on the emulated computer?

I have been interested in this game ever since i heard about if but have been a bit too busy to follow it so forgive me if i'm asking a question that i should already know.

I was interested in how the ships system we are in will link up and how effective they will be.

To my understanding we are using 16 bit computers to program the systems of our ship. But will this just mean creating functions for connecting systems together, or will we be going into more in-dept stuff ?

Let me try and give an example of what I mean.

Case 1 : (The idea that I think we have currently , If its not entirely true feel free to explain it to me  )

We have many systems such as weapons,shields,and power consumption. They have fixed attributes and fixed outputs with dynamics you don't understand or cant find out. You use your computer to create functions and controls so your ship can run effectively . The only real difference you can have in your ships performance is the efficiency of your program and maybe the whole in connectivity.

In the long run the basic idea is to write effective code that has no bugs in and is memory efficient. ( again if that's wrong i would love a more detailed idea )


Case 2: ( The idea which I would think is cool and would make ships so variable In my belief . I also feel it would make it less of a coding exercise and more of a free for all of creativity in design.)

Ships systems can have a default settings so they work effectively to a sense and you can just leave it as a programming challenge to connect them. ( That would be there mainly for the people that don't want to mess around with their ships at the beginning)

But lets say its not entirely efficient ,maybe it works at 70% efficiency on the default package. The dynamics of the systems let say the engine are a result of its parts like the process of an ""energy system "" but also of the sensors and actuators used on it for example.
So you can change the dynamics of the systems by say improving the sensors or maybe a more efficient actuator ( Obviously all these systems have different complexities and difficulties to get )

But not only that you can create algorithms to control the output of your systems . Maybe create feedback loops for your programs or PID controllers to make your systems react quicker .

I think what I'm basically asking is will systems on this ship just work like perfect systems which you will have no control over. Or will they be more ""life like "" and have certain dynamics that can be fiddled with using basic design methods.

As the latter i think would be cool !

Anyway tell me what you think or if you don't understand what I'm trying to ask tell me and ill try and explain it in a more effective way.

repeating prime numbers 2 through 281 (61 primes) with a countdown to june 1 (6/1).

why would he choose such a narrow, specific audience to essentially write himself an extremely complicated birthday card containing a piece of info largely irrelevant to the people solving the problem? and thats not to say that notchs birthday isn't important (happy early birthday dude!) but why not put it someplace were the minecraft masses will notice?

it's a really fun exercise but it seems like a lot of work for such a simple thing being sent to such a small audience. even if we don't find anything more in the stream between now and june 1. it feels like june 1 has to be more than just notchs birthday. It's too clever a setup for that alone to be the punch line. then again as people have pointed out, setting a release date for first alpha seems like a very un-notch thing to do. and so soon?

Maybe watching us scramble around for a couple days trying to decode his birthday card is sort of his birthday present to himself.

We'll just have to keep a close eye on the stream (when we can get enough people to pay attention to it) and see if this theory stays consistent over the next few days. and see what new theories come forward.

It would be a separate type of component that you could hook up to a DCPU.  It would have a perceptron neural net, of varying number of layers/neurons per layer.  The DCPU could be used to train it (with perceptron backpropagation) and then after training to pass calculations through it.

For those less familiar with ANNs, neural nets can be trained to perform mathematical calculations and do pattern-matching.  You give a net a set of inputs, and get one or more outputs.  Depending on their complexity/size, you can train them to do a variety of things.

This is a unique and IMO interesting way to augment the processing power of the DCPU!

Some examples:

* You could train one to do 3d trigonometry

* You could hook all of a missile/probe's sensors into inputs, and the guidance/control systems to the outputs.  You could program/train the net in your ship, then dump the net into your missile (so you don't need to use up a DCPU)

* Guidance/missile tracking systems

Both outputting text and using the keyboard would introduce some sort of delay - that way, people who'd just use the DCPU for interfacing the ship instead of writing the algorithms to run on the DCPU would be penalized, and it might make writing algorithms for the DCPU directly a more viable choice.

It also ties into the ""hard sci-fi level 4"" rating of just a single concept being fictional while allowing the rest of the universe to operate on normal principals and allows for some interesting dynamics as well.

The basic idea is to have a device which can emit a field which alters the cost of inertia relative to a maximum speed.  The basic operation allows ships to have a standard propulsion drive, but make it so that the cost of inertia can be inversely increased or decreased to a correlating decrease and increase of maximum speed.  Effectively creating a pocket of space where the cost of momentum is 1/10th normal and maximum speed is 10c (for instance) or where the cost of momentum is 10*normal and the maximum speed is 1/10th c.

If you allow the field size to vary up to some game tested maximum (say 1/100000th of an AU or approx 150 mile radius) and make it so slow fields overwrite fast fields then you have the following dynamics:

- Ships not proximate to other ships can go faster than light up to their rated field maximum based on their propulsion systems.

- Ships proximate to other ships can be slowed to the proximate ship's rated field minimum based on the propulsion systems.

- Planets/stations can employ ""blockade"" drones surrounding them to prevent FTL missile barrages/dropped rocks.

- Space combat can occur at speeds where human reflexes are relevant if one of the ships dueling wishes to switch to ""combat speed"".

- Proximity sensors can auto-trigger low inertia mode to prevent collisions at high speed.  The bigger the object (like a star) the farther away you can detect and trigger low inertia mode.

Some other thoughts:

- Perhaps have the effects of a gravity well negate the effects of the fields within a certain proximity?

- Have the field power costs tie into a sliding scale based on how slow/fast you go.  If you want to slow down you and your opponent really slow, have it draw all your power, leaving less for movement/shields (also the effect of the slow field would make movement cost more energy anyway)?

There should be no monsters dropping money out of nowhere, there should be no mines giving resources out of nowhere, new users don't get resources from the start.

The world is initially populated with resources, those are picked up by whoever first gets to them, and then as those resources are consumed the server randomly allocates then back to the world, thus creating a cycle of resource consumption.

Someone finds metal that metal is used on a ship, the ship gets damaged, part of the metal is lost, that lost metal is then put back into the world on a distant planet given other players a chance to collect it and gain from its sale or use. In a more advanced version of this model, some resources can actually degrade into simpler components instead. Wood turns to coal, which turns into energy, which after being used can be reintroduced into the world as light to help trees grow, thus creating more wood, and closing the cycle.

This eliminates inflation from the game, which is a problem for ALL long lived MMOs to date, and creates many interesting economic behaviors, very similar to real life, that no other game can currently provide.

TLDR: Nothing is created nor destroyed, everything is transformed.

One fan to another, I am full of excitement on this project and am burgeoning with ideas I'd like to share with you guys and hopefully have an in-depth conversation about the possibility of an OST, and what sort of style the music we'd like to see and the what kind it could be. My opinion on the sort of musical scenarios are broken up into three parts as follows:

I. OST ridden: absolutely no music, e.g. ambient sounds from the ship and planets; the humming of the ship's engine and thrusters; the crunching sound of computers calculating data; trudging pistons; robotic voices giving directives: cold wisps and ice cracking when reaching a cold, desolate planet; heavy hums and bass from whirling clouds on a Venus type planet; I'm sure you get the idea.

II. Ambient drones (space music): The music could be set according to the actions of the game, i.e. heavy ship-to-ship sieges, a more rhythmic tech: www.youtube.com/watch?v=NupnAJIA5dY (great game by the way) . Whereas if it's calm and you're just piloting your ship to another system while operating your terminal, it'd be a Trent Reznor/Jonn Serrie moodpiece: www.youtube.com/watch?v=npFeMDdODi0 ; www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJdzxr4hDe0.

III. Since Notch &amp; Co. are working on this, It'd be safe to assume C418 is going to have something to do with it (or maybe Notch himself). The pseudo-retro pieces that C418 developed were fantastic, and they could even work in 0x10c, but I'd like to see something more along the lines of 'synthwave' - for example: www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeBwHzKStck; http://perturbator.bandcamp.com/

What are some of your guys' ideas?

When I picture space in a video game, I usually imagine an unfathomably large 2d plane.  Even minecraft followed this, you could dig down or build up but you were only limited to 256 or so blocks on that axis.  However, either  of the other axis(es?) could go as high or low as needed.

How do you feel about space being represented in this video game?  I would like to see a similar giant 2d plane with limited depth (*i mean it's SPACE...it can be BIG but limited*) but relatively unlimited size that would allow us to fly space stations and such without colliding with each other (unless you're into that sort of thing.)

* Life support
* GNC - Guidance/Navigation/Control
* Power - (Generator with fixed wattage)
* Propulsion - (FTL travel will be possible)
* Weapons/Shields

Maybe some things can manage themselves without being hooked into the computers (like life support), but for most of the systems you will need a bunch of sensors feeding the computers data, and the computer sending commands back.

I had huge troubles fitting a small subset of the characters I wanted into it. So I had an idea. Different display modes. Basically, without breaking compatibility, it allows many more characters to be displayed. Of course, Notch has said that the monitor is intentionally limited, but this actually plays well with my proposal. The more characters you allow, the more it impacts the other features of the monitor. Here is the specification:

When the DCPU receives an HWI, it checks the A register. If it is equal to 0x0006, then it reads the value of the B register, and switches modes accordingly. Switching modes takes one cycle (except for High-Character Mode) While switching modes, the screen stays on the previous image. 

If it is 0x0000, then it sets the monitor to the current 128-character, blinking, coloured mode (which I call Blink Mode or Mode 0).

If it is 0x0001, then it sets it disables blinking, and allows the blink bit to be used in the encoding of characters. I call this Colour Mode or Mode 1.This allows for a maximum of 256 characters. If a character is blinking when switching to Colour Mode, then it remains blinking in Colour Mode. This allows for blinking text to be displayed by quickly switching to blink mode, cetting a cell, and then switching back to Colour Mode and printing the desired character.

If it is 0x0002, then the LEM switches to High-Character Mode, or HCM, or Mode 2. It takes 10,000 cycles to switch. In HCM, 12 bits of the word are used to encode the character, and 4 bits for foreground colour. This allows for a maximum of 2^12 (4096) characters. This allows characters to be swapped into the font as needed. In HCM, neither blinking nor background colour can be controlled. If one wanted to do this, they would have to switch to Blink Mode, set the colour and the blink bit for the desired cell, switch back to HCM, and write the desired character in the cell. This is possible, but would be very tedious, and the 10,000 cycle switch time makes it nearly impossible to do graphics this way. This is intentional. Notch said that he wanted to present a challenge with the monitor, and that he liked having to work around obstacles, and that's why graphics could only be done with text. So I made it so that you can't just do some switching, and get HCM with colour and blinking, as it takes 1/10 of a second. Not a noticeable delay for the user, but preventing abuse.

If it is 0x0003 or above, then 10,000 cycles will be taken, and then then it will return to Blink Mode.

I believe that having this system in place is important to the future of 0x10c. The current state of the LEM effectively limits it to English speakers. I believe that this system is a fair trade off, and does not make the LEM overpowered, as it forces more restrictions on the user the more characters he/she demands.",,False,self,t5_2tu92,1364660016.0,,,True,t3_1ba164,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/1ba164/lem1802_highcharacter_mode/,

Q: Why does this document exist? Didn't we already have a [booting specification](https://gist.github.com/SirCmpwn/61ad82038843aa0d8767)?

A: While we did have a Firmware Specification, I found the default firmware code to be a little odd. While I have not yet written the firmware code, I want to address the flaws I had with the default.

* Currently, a bootloader does not know where it was loaded from. If there are multiple devices that could have been used, it has to make a guess or assumption. This removes the guesswork involved with booting.
* The boot device does not need to be the first valid boot device in the HWQ listings. I would rather be shown a screen on the DCPU to choose which device to boot (if there are multiple choices), rather than edit some listing as to which disk device must trump the others whenever I want to change boot devices.
* It makes hardware bootable or non-bootable, which can streamline the device selection process. If only one of my devices is marked bootable, the firmware can just start running the code off of that device instead of making me choose every time I turn on my DCPU.

Q: Why does Z hold the device ID?

A: Well, if the bootloader needs to identify what type of device it booted from, HWQ will destroy all of A, B, C, X, and Y's contents. I figured Z would be a perfect register to fit it in without worrying about someone accidentally erasing it (and I and J are so useful with STI and STD!).

Q: What is the purpose of I and J?

A: I figure that rarely, you might need more information than just the device you booted from. What if, say, you're executing an operating system from a remote server? Well, sure, I have the communication device I used, and the boot code for the operating system, but where does the communication device need to call to get more data? What is the data transfer standard for the remote server? Do I need to log in as a user? I and J can hold data, or point to a data structure with that information.

Q: Why is 0x10AD the boot signature?

A: Because it looks like ""LOAD"", and I wanted to be clever. :P

Q: I think that your specification is bad/vague/unclear/a butt.

A: That's not a question, but I'll gladly take any input about making it better. :)",,False,self,t5_2tu92,False,,,True,t3_1aymme,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/1aymme/bootloader_specification_yay/,

Suppose that I came up with a really awesome program.  I really want to keep the source code myself, but I'm willing to sell it to others...

...except I'd developed it in singleplayer.

What I'd like to see is a sort of ""quantum floppy"" - one whose contents are saved on an official Mojang server or something, linked to a username.  For balancing (and RL Cost) reasons, each player only has one such space on the server.)

Storing these ""quantum floppies"" wouldn't be too costly for Mojang - [1 GiB of HDD space could hold up to 728 users' 1440 KiB QF's](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+GiB+%2F+1440+KiB), which means (after [a quick Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=server+hard+drives&amp;tbm=shop) and picking the first item - [a 1TB HDD for $183](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/5491665870220096562)) that it's roughly [0.03 US Cents per user's QF](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1440+KiB+%2F+%281+TB+%2F+%24183%29).

And if you're asking for data out of the QF sector-by-sector, that's roughly 1 KiB of data (1024 8-bit bytes) being sent through the network.  Taking the supposed 2009 Internet speed average for the United States at around [4.8mbps, or 4.8 megabits per second](http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/internet-speeds-and-costs) (no matter how potentially unreliable that source might be), that's roughly [1.71 milliseconds per sector](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1024+bytes+%2F+4.8mbps)... which, according to the [M35FD specs](http://dcpu.com/floppy-drive/), quoting a read/write speed of 30.7 kilowords per second, or 61.4 kilobytes per second, or [0.4912 megabits per second](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=61.4+kilobytes+per+second+in+Mbps), there's plenty of time for this data to come through a halfway-decent Internet connection of 2013.

Calculations (and Wolfram|Alpha) aside, there's one huge use I could see for a Quantum Floppy.  Yes, granted, information could be transferred between saves / servers / dimensions / whatever we're gonna call it, but I can definitely see that there could be a number of servers popping up, with the sole purpose of trading code between players.  There could be a whole economy (and a potentially huge pirating community) based around code trade.  Alternatively, it could be used to allow players to go on various servers with their favorite programs in tow.

Again, yes, this is all subject to whether or not Mojang will allow this, but, hey, you never know.",,False,self,t5_2tu92,False,,,True,t3_172zja,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/172zja/code_transport_between_saves_dimensions/,

There is a lot of talk about software in 0x10^c and not so much about hardware. It might be an interesting topic. So, to make a hardware device you must first know what are you making :) and you need specs for that hardware, but that's not enough. In real world you also need raw materials so it would be nice if we see that in 0x10^c.

I'm thinking about, in addition to specs and firmware for your hardware device, you'd need to have some resources and means to actually make it. 

Imagine hardware designers, engineers (we have that already BTW :)) but also hardware producers, manufacturers, who make actual hardware. And, of course, vendors.

Just wandering what do you think about that. I'm not sure what parameters would define which materials will be used for any particular component and in what quantities, but I think it would be possible to come up with some kind of scheme for it. Don't know is Notch considering something like that.

This is because I have played many MMORPG's in the past, and they all have the same experience, no matter what they actually advertise up front.

1. Quest from guys with some form of punctuation above their heads

2. Experience, gained from killing monsters to get better at killing monsters

3. Gold, to buy more things to get better at killing monsters

4. No story, only that little bit based around 4-5 pre-chosen factors shown at the very beginning cut scene

5. A small area of actually being able to move, and do things, with the rest as fillers

6. Every option based on a drop down menu of either saintly, neutral, or horrifyingly evil

These are things in every MMORPG, ever. I started thinking about this, and realizing in my head what the WORST possible outcome of 0x10c would be the following.

You start out on a random planet, but every planet is the same in essence (discluding size and color) so it doesn’t really matter. You have a log/person telling you what to do, and where to go until you get to your spaceship, at which point you can see that every planet has x forest, x gas, x mineral, and you can mine them from 3-4 key areas shown by  little dots on the planet to show you where exactly to go. You the fly around from planet to planet, leveling skills pre-defined by that one class you chose at the beginning, buying from the ""Intergalactic Shop"" to be able to kill even better, with no way to even connect with your character, who might as well be your ship for all you know, because every planet has only certain areas to explore with certain monsters in that area, and in your ship, the DCPU turned out to be an extra feature used to lure people with no actual use, all the while actions and what you do in the game are based off of three options to every action, deciding if you are a saintly vanguard or a hellish space pirate with hardly an in-between. 

That would be a cookie cutter MMORPG. Raking in millions, then rolling up with DLC, until it become unpopular, and then coming out with a new and improved sequel to the game making an improvement on graphics as a selling point. This, again, is NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECT TO SEE. I would lose all faith in Mojang/humanity. What Mojang and Notch need to do is reinvent the genre. The game isn't even Alpha and it has over 10,000 followers, and I believe notch can do a lot more at this point creatively than many other companies out there only for the money with their cookie cutter design. It doesn’t need better graphics, a unique story, or a thrilling protagonist even to sell me. It needs, I believe, completely open world, no restrictions, paths, or dialogue that binds you to either good or evil. This is advertised all over, many hundreds of games claim to have these aspects, of total control, but really none have done it, and I believe that someone can, so why couldn't it be my favorite indi game company? 

Starting out, you have many random factors, with only what is on you chosen from many different starting professions to guide you, but not bind you to a path. The first planet could either be a home for weeks, or instantly a launch pad into space exploration from the random factors of if your injured, nearness of a ship, if you are in space and need to pilot into an orbit, how close a ship is to you, enemies, and materials available. You construct what you do at this point. Your ship and computer trustworthy and ready to serve at your command, you start your adventure. No features left out, nothing advertised just an extra feature. Everything is as important or used as you want, or as you make it to be. 

I am sorry for the EXTREMELY long post, but I have only seen specific things posted as questions about the game and how it will operate on minute details, so I felt like I just wanted to say what I felt and what I want to see out of this game as a whole, even it starting with the words MMORPG making many people possibly having a bit too much premise, or to little about what the game will actually be like because of this one acronym, and what it will mean for how good or bad the game, in the end turns out to be. I am as excited as the next guy to see this game develop all the way through, and am ready for a as many changes and variation as there needs to be. It would be interesting to see what opinions anyone has, and want to know if what the things that I am thinking about are actual things should be tossed around as ideas for a game at such an early stage of development. 

Tl;dr: I started thinking about what it would entail starting off as under the title of an MMORPG, think that most things from the cookie cutter MMORPG design should be left out, and have a few opinions on what really would make the game 100% times better while sticking to the actual background and premise of the game.

It compiles macro-decorated assembly into either binary files or flat assembly you can use in another assembler. It's a bit feature-bare at the moment (no org, .inc, .incbin, .reserve, or some other handy features), but it has all the instructions + dat, which is enough for a lot of programs.

For example, Tena compiles the below program:

    ; Reading characters from the keyboard
    ; by Markus Persson
    
    #macro push(what) {
        set push, what
    }
    
    #macro pop(what) {
        set pop, what
    }
    
    #macro nextkey(target) {
        push(i)
        set i,[keypointer]
        add i,0x9000
        set target,[i]
        ife target,0
            set pc, end
    
        set [i],0
        add [keypointer], 1
        and [keypointer], 0xf
    :end
        pop(i)
    }
    
    nextkey(a)
    nextkey(b)
    
    :keypointer
    dat 0

into this:

    19a1 7861 001e 7c62 9000 3801 800c 7dc1
    000e 80e1 85e2 001e bde9 001e 1981 19a1
    7861 001e 7c62 9000 3811 801c 7dc1 001d
    80e1 85e2 001e bde9 001e 1981 0020 0000

(note this program will not do much, you'll need an emulator with keyboard buffer support (NOT the DCPU Studio default mode) and register views, and you need to put the reading macros in a loop so the PC doesn't just run off into the dat)

It can also correctly compile the example program in the DCPU specs and will attempt to use short-form literals for non-label values (labels need to be fixed up after code generation so are too complicated to make short-form).

Another would be the classic military carrier, where drones can be ordered to attack enemies, maybe with capabilities to fly in formations or executing specific attack patterns. 

The drones don't need to be autonomous either. Get together with a group of friends and fly epic space battles as a group, with one steering the carrier and issuing orders to the others in the fighter ships.

BEQ is stricly more useful than IFE since it lets you jump to an arbitrary instruction instead of only two ahead. You could accomplish the same thing as a single BEQ instruction, but it takes two instructions under the current spec, IFE and then a SET. (You'd have to get rid of the two shift in the offset, though, since instructions in DCPU-16 aren't word-aligned, as they are in MIPS.)

To take this a step nerdier: There's a pretty high hardware cost in implementing IF_ in a processor architecture relative to B__ due to having to fetch and decode the next instruction (to know how much to increment the PC by) in the middle of the writeback.

This would let me write a program that scans the area around the ship and warns me when something appears. This could be used to automate the ship to not run into an asteroid but also to open fire automatically.
And it would only return the distance, not what it is it found. Maybe a more advanced version of it could also specify what material it found (stone, iron, dark matter, etc) by returning a number one would have to look up.

Floppy disks: I hope they have a condition and this decreases by use. Maybe even down to sector level like on the real life ones. One would need to make sure that the data was actually written and avoid any sectors that is damaged.
I also hope floppy disks are common, but floppies in a good condition could be rare.

Harddrives: Yes please. The standard ship may not come with one but it would be great if one could find these rare objects in destroyed ships and space stations. They might even contain a few utillities and/or source if one is lucky.

Computers: Let us salvage these from ships and stations if we find them. Let us fill entire rooms with them if we want! But they all drain power so one might not want to have them all active at once. 

Lots and lots of gadgets: I would like to find and place small in-ship sensors as well. Motion detectors, speakers one can play 8-bit sid chip music with (would need an entire dedicated dcpu16 but I think it would be worth it), multiverse network adapters, light bulbs (dcpu16 controlled), robots (with dcpu16 chips in them), tools to mount on the robots, and so on. Lots of stuff! Simple stuff. Stuff one can hook into a dcpu16 and make them dance.

Ever since Notch announced the DCPU-16 programming aspect of his new game, I've been very eager to see how that relates to or integrates with gameplay. I simply can't see how in the world this might be pulled off to become a ""fun-feature"" for the average player. **I am *not* saying the idea is bad (I personally love it)**, but can't see how it can be integrated in a way to make it either relavent, useful, or fun.

Notch has made it clear on his website that the programming may not be required or necessary for gameplay: ""... or just to play games on while waiting for a large mining operation to finish ..."" (from the official website). To me, this makes the feature irrelevant for the average player: just alt-tab and browse Reddit! Even *if* programming was required to control ships or do something useful in the game-world, users could quickly copy-paste someone else's code.

I'd like to know how Mojang/Markus feels about this.  Would you be opposed to it as it would circumvent users paying for subscriptions to your MMO service?  Would it add a level of complication that you don't want to work into the game?  

I would like to have a personal server to play with close friends and family, and I would like the ability to install mods that take away things like FTL travel and restrict all players to a single star system.  I want trips between celestial objects to take days, weeks or even months.  I want communication speeds limited to c. I think it would be interesting to wake up in an unknown star system that needs to be explored.  I would like to build new ships and satellites out of the raw materials I find there.  I think it would be fascinating to build an interplanetary communication network and maintain it (hardware/software failures, asteroid collisions, running out of fuel and burning up in orbit around a planet, etc).

Of course, the problem with what I'm saying is it's all just stuff that ""I want"" or what ""I think"" would be cool.  I know it's not my place to tell Mojang what to with their game.

It could be a form of quick travel, if Notch doesn't allow FTL drives.

What if the OS inspects the program code each time before it hands off control to ensure that the program calls back to the OS? Potentially, the OS could even inject a call back to itself into the program before running it.

I don't have any family, so that won't be any problem.

**Sensor interface**- so that ship can do things like automatically avoid collisions, or warn you if a unknown ship comes into sensor range.

**Information warfare systems** - enemy ship hacking, breaking enemy IMF’s, taping into enemy com traffic

I have an extensive background in administering phpBB forums and programming using the webstack. I also have a fair bit of skill working with Java.

As great as reddit is for sharing new links/information, old information gets lost far too easily. It would be preferable to have a forum setup, such as phpBB, for community management and use. I can host/setup/manage a forum for the community.

If you want a forum, I need two things: a name for the game so I can get a relevant domain and a general consensus that a forum is the route we want to take to keep the community organized through the years of development. 

In the interest of openness and data integrity, I can set up a database push with all public posts for community download (nothing from the user table, etc.)... But again, only if the community wants it.

Edit: Some details of project organization below
Forum wise, first step is to get a recruitment forum set up so we can organize the talent, get people set into teams (graphics, engine, UI, sound, PR, etc.), and start setting up the work environment. 0 A.D. uses Trac, however they have been considering a move to pure GitHub. 

To figure out what we have to do, we'll need a ticketing system as well as a group to make design decisions. GitHub has an issues system but something like Trac might work better given the hoped for volume of tickets project movement. 

To organize the code, we'd ideally run a single 'official' branch that exists for official dev team use and pulling code from the community. Depending on the styles of our developers, we might run the official branch as a pull-only branch so that it can be downloaded at any time and compiled so people know our progress.

For discussion, we'd ideally have IRC or some equivalent (google hangouts, anybody?) that can be used for general chat/Q&amp;A then have separate rooms for 'official' debate which are then immortalized in the forum for general reference. One of the major downfalls of many communities is the entrance difficulty because official communications are fragmented and often lost.

(Hopefully a unique one),Alphasite,34,25,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/15m720/my_thoughts_and_yours_on_alternative_to_the/,"I know something along these lines will have been suggested a hundred time before, but honestly, this IS what i would really want from this game. Its something along the lines of a mix of Minecraft, Some Industrial Mods, and Spacebuild. Also, i hope this is what other people had in mind for the game? 

Basically, what i've tried to build into this system is, the flexibility of a good platform (like Minecraft's Redstone + Blocks), empowering the player, and also putting some constraints, making the whole system a little more interesting, injecting in a little challenge, by trying to make sure theres no one route, better than any other. It also adds lots of room for a tech tree as well. [On the off chance you missed this](https://plus.google.com/112678702228711889851/posts/eVeouesvaVX), a good rant, which although very abstract for this situation, does provide some good insight into why its good to give the user the power to do these sort of things.

In the beginning, the game provides you with a starting ship, a nice small ship, with all the basics, power, computer etc, not too big, not too fast, but simple, a good base to work from. Where this diverges from the standard methodology is, the way you design ships, and this is where spacebuild (and tekkit) comes in, Rather than following the standard formula, with very superficial alterations, you manually build the systems form scratch. 

Before i get onto the topic, theres the very obvious problem of, what about those people who don't want that much depth (those same people who just want to build a nice house in minecraft)? Well, theres a multitude of ways of working around this, prebuilt modules, construction companies (player or npc), expanding the first ship, etc, take your pick.

Rather than some bastardisation of QTEs and minigames, you actually design and build the ship, how well it works, is a testament to how well you built it. An example of of why i think this could be REALLY fun: Imagine that you've taken damage to your rear engine, and it goes offline, so you pop out of the ship for a minute, wearing your spacesuit, propel yourself to the back of the ship, and take a look at the engine. What could be the problem? Glance in, and yo notice that a you've had a small explosion on the back of your ship, and its destroyed some covers, some pipes, and damaged the engine strut. So rather than pull out a magical welding torch, you open your backpack, and go start placing down some new support, place down some new wires and add a new cover, and then go a bit overboard on the armour, because if they'd hit a little harder, your engine would have dropped right off.

I should mention, personally, i think minigames suck, at least for this kind of task, so i tried to avoid them as much as physically possible.

Anyway, the more definite influences form Spacebuild would be its resource systems, and its storage systems. You'd pop down a resource container (or make a room for this, you'd need to try it to see which is a better system), and then you start placing down pipes to connect the storage container to a machine, or a dispenser, or even the engines, if you're desperate for some fuel.

The mod influences (especially Redpower,  though paraphrasing Eloraam, ""You're just implementing this straight of wikipedia"", its not copying). come in with the pipes, machines for controlling distribution, as well as frames style creations.

There were some other things i wanted to put down, but honestly they've, slipped my mind. So what do you want? And what do you think?

TL;DR 0x10c ≈ Minecraft + Spacebuild - Redstone + Redpower/Buildcraft (Sort of).

* The Integral part of the algorithm looks at how much error you have accumulated.

I realize the game is in development, not much is known and anything can change at any point. 

So all of my info about the game comes from [0x10c.com/](http://0x10c.com). I havent really scoured the internet for the latest nuggets of info, aside from trolling this subreddit. 

Thats when I read the follow nugget from Notch.

&gt;[Honestly, I'm MORE interested in the personal fighting than the ship fighting. I want the game to be about people on ships, not about the ships.](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/s5svp/interpersonal_out_of_ship_combat/c4brh9j)

The website mentions in the hopeful feature section ""Space battles against the AI or other players. "" Which I guess doesn't necessarily mean ship to ship combat, but thats how I took it. I don't think I was expecting any big space dog fights or star trek like battles, but maybe a little something like Xcom. Where you engage an enemy with your ship, neutralize it, then board it and let the fun begin. 

So I guess, maybe, I'm getting mixed signals. 

So if anyone has more insight or info into what role ships will have? Any word on ship to ship combat? How about upgrading and tweaking teh ships? Can I pimp my ride? 

Again, I realize that some/most/all of my question might be unanswerable. But I just want to know what the latest news/gossip is on ships in general. 

Thanks all!

All you really need to do is sacrifice some realtimeness, which isn't much of a problem given that your ship is already spending the vast majority of its time under AI control. Think folding@home, bitcoin, or bittorrent: when a player boots up their client, it simulates not only their own ship, but also the ships of another hundred or so people. Only one player in a hundred would have to be online at any given time to keep the world running.

This would have a few useful effects. First, private realms with mods would be very easy. Second, it trivializes single-player into a special case of multiplayer. Both of these make the game more robust; we all know about the issues with SSP vs. SMP in Minecraft. Most importantly, no more monthly fee for centralized servers.

Security is not a problem; have clients duplicate parts of the simulation and check each others' work. Upload speed isn't a problem because truly realtime interaction isn't necessary; just distribute game state by peercast.

I would like to first preface this post by saying I am in no means trying to discourage the community or smacktalk the game. I am here trying to promote an open honest discussion on the topic.


So, let's start things off. I have just discovered the existance of 0x10c recently (2-3 weeks ago), and even more recently stumbled upon the (almost) hidden fact that in order to play the game in Multiplayer, it will require a subscription.


Now, I feel as is there is a strong part of the community (the minecraft community, anyways), to whom this will not effect. I think there is a fairly large core of gamers who enjoy the single player experience. I can understand that. However, with Minecraft, my interest has been and always will be in the multiplayer. I get lonely in single player, it's not the type of game I have fun playing alone.


I am not trying to directly relate 0x10c to Minecraft. but I pose the question: do you really feel a subscription fee will be worth it? and furthermore, where is our money going to go? are there going to be dedicated servers provided by Mojang? or are we just going to be paying to have a 'pass' to let us 'use' the multiplayer functions and then have to make our own servers?


is that in any way fair or reasonable? I was an early adopter for Minecraft, as I'm sure some of you were. Especially before Mojang got the coverage it did through avenues such as steam, updates were pretty scarce.


I'm not saying this is going to be the same scenario, but do you feel if the current development cycle is applied to 0x10c that it would be worth your money? Again, it's entirely speculative because we have not been given many details on pricing, or let alone on the game. which is part of my issue with this.


why is Notch so sure on subscriptions? is it because he feels this will allow him to pool more resources and provide smoother updates more frequently? or is it because of the insane amount of revenue that could be generated in a few months alone because he already has his target market?


Don't get me wrong. I am not trying to call Notch out and say he is 'going in it for the money', that is not my belief. I am just a little unsettled at the idea of this game being subscription based, especially in an age where paid subscription methods are becoming less and less predominate (a la free games with microshops included).


So again, I ask you, the community: what's your opinion? how do you feel? did you even know about the subscription requirement? do you feel I am being too unreasonable too early?

Let's face it. Some of the most exciting times I have had playing space sims like Battlecruiser Milennium or the X Series were during the times I was risking losing some or all of my assets or crew. Based upon the length of time you have spent commanding a ship, you kind of grow an attachment to your crew and the big metal bucket that carries all of them around. 

How do you think loss of ship and death should be handled? I don’t feel there’s any excitement if you don’t have a chance of losing at least a portion of what you have worked on.

I would also love to have a reason to send all my crewmembers to escape pods and fighters when the ship’s going critical. If the game ends when your ship ends, why bother evacuating? For this reason, I believe ship death and player death should be separately handled events.

Hardcore mode / permadeath aside, how do you think we should be penalized for dying?

Still though, just because r/0x10 knows lots about stuff like this I figured it might be worth asking: what kinds ways could wireless communication potentially work in 0x10c?

I mean, I've heard tons of ideas going around about using wireless communication as security (if you don't ping back we eat you), using it to transfer programs, using it to plan and organize resources and other things like that, that I guess I'm just wondering, what kinds of technologies practically exist (or more importantly, could theoretically exist) that might make ship to ship communication possible?

So far, the problem with space communication just seems that we'd have trouble communicating with people from such far distances away. If planets and solar systems really are at planet and solar system sizes, communicating with people a few solar systems away would turn into like light years away - meaning that we'd have to wait like years just to get signals to each other - which seems impractical.

On the other hand, some kind of universal communication device (maybe based off [entangled pairs](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149) or something) that everyone had and communicate with each other would be cool and all, but it seems like that would just lead to data clutter to the extreme (1000+ people all sending nice messages through the same medium - not to mention the SPAMBOTS we all know we'd create or use ""just for fun"").

Yet, using this principle, might it be possible to have some sort of ""linkable entangled pair""? I mean, I'm a little sketchy on the science of this, so feel free to correct me if this is impossible or anything, but what about something like this: 

Every player has a ""connection box"" of sorts, and an alternative ""communication box"". This connection box would be the entangled pair thing everyone was connected to, yet, with, say, 1000 receiving pairs (all linked to everyone else's pairs). These pairs would be set up in a way that data is transferred in binary back to each computer through the pairs, with a sort of integrated circuit like system that makes that transfer. Somehow (internally to this device - this is something I'm a little sketchy on but I imagine is possible - feel free to expand here (or anywhere else for that matter)), when you send a code, you will connect to that specific, say 32 bit code of entangled pairs. In other words, your ""connection box"" will modify your ""communication box""'s entangled pair(s) to only be connected to anyone else's entangled pairs that sent the same bit code in their connection box. Then, once these are modified, data could be transferred seamlessly to anyone that was connected to these ports - regardless of distance, which would be nice. If multiple people were connected to the same port, possibly the communication box could have a little bit pattern at the start that specified how many people were connected, then have bits (or even bytes) of entangled pairs after that designated to each person. Something like this would simply allow some interrupt-assembly forms of (connect_to(fish), read_from(bob)), etc., which would be fun for, say, playing pong halfway across the universe and stuff, not to mention seemingly working well with lots of the ideas mentioned above and throughout this sub-reddit, and saving program space as most of the work would be done internally to the chip.

Would some system like this be possible? What would the limits on a system like this be? Is 32 bits of identification too little - or too much? And, of course, would any alternative methods (such as http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149 via faster than the speed of light pigeons) also be possible or better, maybe just in some specific ways?

[r/0x10c](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c), what do you think?

edit: [atnorman](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/1242lg/wireless_communication/c6spoht);s right, this method still wouldn't allow faster than light travel of information, due to the way entangled pairs de-entangle once you measure them and more significantly needing to send the interpreter code.

edit edit: Alternatively, though, I like [Troadle](http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/1242lg/wireless_communication/c742l05)'s idea. The thought of large infrastructure systems developing over time would be fun. Plus, if these sorts of towers allowed for more than just communication: IE: Accurate position info and such near them, it would really encourage the development of communities and just main areas in general (with huge ""towers"" that everyone worked on), while also maintaining the excitement of exploring new areas where you can't necessarily just put your ship on ""autododge and collect"" to get all the resources you need.",,False,self,t5_2tu92,1354827127.0,,,True,t3_1242lg,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/1242lg/wireless_communication/,

The DCPU and the group of people surrounding it is amazing, people see Notch is making a new game, and they jump on it. Suddenly things are decides on by the collective whole for what work for right now.

We have a DCPU specification which is what the majority of it is based around, however the rest is just speculation, frantic speculation at that.

My hopes for change in the coming days in regards to the DCPU are as thus.

**What I hope for**
*Revision of the specification*
I hope to see notch tap into the overwhelming ability of all those long time designers and writers of assembly out there, both to make it easier to write, make the programs more powerful but at the same time lower the complexity of emulation and time required to emulate it.

**Why this may not happen**
*Public outcry*, pure and simple.
We have people that have designed the foundations of Operating Systems already, these people who frantically rushed to build something big in the early days are the keep mitigating factor to a better DCPU. They don't want their work undone. But I wonder whose fault that really is.
*Complexity*, 
Revising the specification requires some complex choices, but hopefully the crowd of experts the games announcement has gathered can assist.
*Lack of resource*,
notch may not know whos advice to follow or trust in. There are so many voices in a crowd. This may be the biggest issue.

**What I hope for**
*Revision in the display system.*
I hope to see the glyph limitation of being 4 by 8 lifted. I would hope to see at least 6 by 12, failing that I could work with 8 by 8. I do think the system should however remain tilebased. A tile system should be at least 8 by 8.
The number of tiles is an interesting issue, I think that there should be no default character set or tiles, except what a bios loads into memory. Defining an 8 by 8 tile requires 64 bits, which is 4 words. However, However that is not really an issue. Each OS can define its own memory location with tiles for graphics useage. Thus allowing the graphics system to just pull the data from a pointer.
But this cuts into the limited memory we are allowed, but hopefully that is resolved. We could load the glyphs and then unload the loading system.

Additionally, most of the time the color of graphics are specified within the graphics card of a device. However being emulated, we could get around this issue and allowing the colors to be defined via a 16 bit color, 5 bit 6 bit 5 bit color codes.

On a final note here, I would hope that we can refresh the display on a line by line basis allowing us to change these mid change and producing very interesting effects.
However this would require interrupts, something notch mentioned he didn't want.

**Why this may not happen**
*Public outcry*, again.
People are set in their ways and resist change. But for a game so early in its development, I wonder why some can believe things are set in stone.

I am not so much the combat type, so i will take the mining approach.
I am going to try to find a good asteroid belt and a nearby space station, and then sell it for other goods/currency.

My idea:

 • Drone 'Fleet'

 
 -These drones will be small, cheap, and cost-effective.
 
-I will have an even amount of them.

 -Since they are small, i can fit lots of them in the hull.

 -They will be cheap, so easy to replace if one breaks.
 
-They will be given a small cargo container and a small engine, along with a remote controll device.

 -There will be a Drop off point on my ship near the cargo-bay.
 
  • Command Ship

  
 -This will house me, with a big mining drill, that will extend out of the hull.
 
(Option 2: If there are mining lasers, I will use those instead.

 -The ship will be at best nog bigger than 800 Meters/1 KM.
 
(Note: My crew will exist of 4; 3 Friends and Me.
 
 It will feature 4 Stations:
 
 -Basic Things: Engines, Oxygen, Power flow, etc.

 -Drone Controll: This will controll the drones, when they are not in automatic mode.
 
-Captain's Station: This console will be offline mostly, and will only be used for Intercoms, and Journals, etc.

 -Electronic Warfare: In the case we are attacked, we can 'hack' the Enemy ship. ( Assuming this is possible )
 
 • Plans


 -Me and my friends gather in our basic ship.

 -We fuse our ships together (Assuming this is possible)

 -We mine untill we have the required resources.

 -We build the ship, and start Drone production while mining.

 -We sell our goods, and possibly the drone blueprints.
 
 • Crew

 
 -As i said, my crew will exist of 4, including Me.
 
 Me; The captain of the ship.

 Miguel; Best friend, XO, and also great at coding. mans the Electronic Warfare / Basics Console (If neccesary)

 Mirko; This guy is your average WoW player, who will command the Basics.

 Mike; This guy is your typical 'engineer', he will be in charge of manufacturing.
  
 I know this is all based on ideas and toughts, but if Notch is giving us this Amazing game, i hope i can do this, along with my friends.

You could add a component to a weapon that allows you to charge your shot, firing a larger, more damaging blast at the cost of increased battery usage. But why stop there? Perhaps there could be a number of charge attack components. For example you could charge your weapon, and when releasing, your gun will fire 3-6 shots in a burst, or maybe have a wide scattering effect, as if fired from a shotgun.

And also that this information retrieved is residing in the users memory on the client program.



The idea is to use the DCPU simply as a proxy for retrieving and returning information, between the game world and your home PC via a memory hack using an outside program.

**INITIATING WAKE UP SEQUENCE**

The green, blocky text displayed on the largest monitor of the three on the console.  The other two monitors scrolled furiously through enormous sections of text at an incomprehensible rate.  A buzzer pierced through the eerie silence of the interior of the vessel.  It buzzed continuously for a few minutes.

When the buzzing stopped the table housing the human began to hum gently.  The dim blue lights on the interior of the glass casing slowly shifted to purple then to red.  They slowly grew in intensity matched by the humming that emanated from the bowels of the machinery underneath the table.  By the time the luminosity of the lights had reached its peak nearly an hour had passed.  Each of the human's limbs twitched rhythmically.  Another hour passed as the frequency and the strength of the twitches increased.

The twitching stopped.  The humming stopped.  The lights on the table turned off.

After ten seconds of complete silence gears within the table began to turn.  A quiet cranking sound echoed off the steel walls of the small, enclosed space.  The table began to slowly tilt the human's feet towards the ground.  The being's head rose towards the ceiling.  It showed no signs of life.

The table stopped at a 67.5 degree angle in relation to the floor.  For several uneventful minutes it stayed motionless.

The main monitor on the console flashed solid green then went black.  A thin, green line started from the far left of the screen and extended across before reaching the other end of the screen.  At first it was motionless.  Then, it quivered ever so slightly.  Then it spiked.  The spike was accompanied by a high-pitched beep.  Another spike and another beep.  Another.  Another.  This continued for several minutes.

After the heart rate stabilized the screen returned to blackness and the glass cover on the table slid open with a hiss.

**In A Lab**

""Here she is,"" the engineer slapped the side of the vessel.  It issued a dull, metallic echo.

The ship was 70 feet long from nose to exhaust and 15 feet wide.  She was held up on metal scaffolding and men in white coats scurried around, under, and inside of her.

""Well, not the exact one you'll be in.  Yours is already in orbit.""

Harvey stood in awe of the miracle of modern science that stood before him.  In less than 24 hours he had gone from sweating nervously at the interview to being prepped for spaceflight.  They said they needed him.  That they could not compete with the Russians without him.  While all of this was indeed flattering, the effects were lessened because he knew their source.  They didn't want *him* per say, but the information he had on his former professor's work.  Information he knew intimately and could recreate.

None of that mattered though, he decided.  He was living his dream life.  He was going to travel through space and time to work on a project unfathomable by the general human populace.  Billions of dollars were being poured into this project.  The greatest minds in the nation were stretching knowable science to its limits and breaking them.  Time was the only luxury this project couldn't afford.  Which is why tomorrow he would be leaving Earth and his entire life behind for good.

Harvey stuck his hand into his pocket and retrieved his wallet.  He opened it and pulled out a small photograph of his wife and three year old son, Benny.  After tomorrow it is likely he would never see his wife again.  The possibility existed of him reuniting with his son at some point in the future, but his son would be older than Harvey himself was now.  Did Harvey want that?  Would Benny want that?

He stuck the photograph back into his wallet and his wallet back into his pocket.  He couldn't afford to think about his family right now.  He would see them tomorrow before leaving.  There were more important things at stake here.  The Soviets could not succeed.  They could not unlock the secrets of gravity manipulation, of infinite energy, before the Americans.

""But, energy is finite!"" anyone with any decent education might argue, ""It cannot be created or destroyed!""

That, of course, was incorrect.  Dr. Powler had suggested it and kept it private as to avoid ridicule.  His experiments yielded no significant results.  To Harvey's knowledge Dr. Powler had written his ideas off as nothing more than a scientist's dream.  Dr. Powler retired and moved abroad.  Living respectably as a former renown professor.

But, his experiments continued.  With new funding and under new, more accommodating hosts.  Dr. Powler was under the employ of the USSR, and had been for many years.  It seems that behind the Iron Curtain the good doctor had his fair share of success.  He had been able to demonstrate, on a small level, that infinite energy was not a myth.  It was very much a reality.

""You ready for a tour of the inside?""  The engineer asked young Harvey Aldrich, interrupting his thoughts, ""You've only got a few hours to acquaint yourself with her before you get sent up.""

""Um.  Uh.  Yes, please."" Harvey stammered.  He followed the engineer up the metal staircase to the entrance of the craft.  His thoughts returned to the task at hand.

The glass cover on the table slid open with a hiss. An unconscious, naked man leaned against it.  His head was shaved, his body immaculately clean, and his skin was covered in tiny droplets of water like moisture on the outside of a bottle on a hot day.

His eyes snapped open and his body tensed.  He looked around frantically but his body did not move.  After a brief moment his mouth slowly opened to nearly its full extent and he sharply inhaled until his lungs were full.  He held his breath for a moment before releasing the air trapped within his lungs slowly and steadily.  His body relaxed.

The naked man pressed his arms against the table behind him and pushed himself forward.  He was struggling.  He managed to lift his upper torso forward enough so that he was completely upright.  He breathed heavily again and looked around.  Save for his breath it was completely silent.  He leaned farther forward and extended his left leg.  He pressed his foot onto the white, cushioned floor.  His leg gave way and he collapsed off of the table, falling unceremoniously to his side.

To anyone interested, with an opinion, or writing a language - will your compiler run from the commandline and have an assembly-output option with labels for global symbols, for instance - or should the community get together to produce a common binary (or even modified-assembly language) object format with support for public symbols and perhaps most importantly, relocatability?

I'd love to work with a designer at some point, when we have more plans, to produce a solid home page with the ability to add to it as we go. I can easily host it on my server, especially if we used a static site generator.

This site would basically be an aggregation of some news feeds, a description and a tonne of links. It could later contain developer lists, concept art and *eventually* downloads.

If it were built using Octopress/Jekyll as a base then it could also have blogging built in which might be nice for consolidated status reports to the world. We could use something like Tumblr instead which could then be themed, I have some experience with that.

Another approach would be to build it on top of WordPress. I've had a lot of experience with theming, optimising and securing WP sites in the past. Google ""Lux Monkey"" for an example of my WP stuff.

This will be based on the classic battle ship game.  It will be played across radio communication.  Each side will need a Client program.


**Design Issues involved:**

*Communications have not been specified yet.
*There is no central trusted server to run the game on.
*Each side will likely have the ability to modify their client to their advantage where possible.



**Game rules:**

Setup-One player will run the battleship client and invite another player to join.  The player doing the inviting gets first move as motivation to offer.  The exact way that the inviting will work will depend on how radio communications are implemented.  Ther other player will run the game client and receive the offer and (presumably) accept.  The players will then be presented with a tile based grid that will likely fill the screen.  Using the arrow keys to move and space bar to turn, each player will place their various length ships on the grid.  No two ships can over lap.  


When finished each client will send a checksum code to the other side to the other client.  This checksum will be used at the end to verify that ship locations were not moved mid battle.  The checksum also verifies that the other side is ready to begin.


Players take turns selecting squares on the grid to shoot.  The client will send the coordinate, and the other client will respond with a hit or miss.  The client will record and display the hits and misses of the opposing side.  During the opposing players turn the screen will show the players their own current situation.  The game ends when all ships have been sunk on one side.  The clients then send their ship layout to the opposing side so that check sums can be calcuated and verified and shot hit or miss locations can be verified as well.


When both clients agree it was a fair game, the winner is announced and the game is ended.",,False,self,t5_2tu92,False,,,True,t3_six94,http://www.reddit.com/r/0x10c/comments/six94/multiplayer_dcpu_battleshipdesign_spec/,

Notice the odd character instead of the blinking cursor it should have.  Also notice (in the command line behind and below the window) that I did not set it to run with radiation emulation this time.

Can anyone offer an explanation? Is there an explanation that can even be given?

As I mentioned before, I like it best when my code can be run on as many platforms as possible.  I have heard that notch may release his own DCPU-16 emulator.  Is this true?

This may be a bit too early to start programming for this idea anyway, as (as far as I know) no details have been released as to how networking between computers would work.

Anyway, my idea (bear with me; I have no clue what I'm talking about).

***

There would be a bank of computers with most of their memory dedicated to storing data; these would have very small programs to interface with the next computer I describe. These wold be data servers, and they'd be numbered or otherwise named.

There would be a computer programmed to receive a call from a user that would follow some sort of format like this:

    data server name:memory address

It would then pass the memory address to be read to the specified data server, which would then return the value of that address to this server, which would pass it on to the user. God I hope that made some sort of sense.

There are literally dozens (if not hundreds) of geniuses working on DCPU stuff.  http://0x10cwiki.com/wiki/Developer_Tools

What I keep thinking is, if he can actually figure out the engineering for keeping all of the computers running on the server and in synch with the computers on the ships and between ships, that will be amazing. 

And then add maybe one other difficult thing: an open modding system that you could use to add new devices to the DCPU or to modify the planet rendering or whatever.  Then you would have a small set of approved mods that have been carefully tested and selected and would be allowed on official Mojang servers.

The way you would control the gameplay for Mojang servers would be by selecting and creating mods.  So that way you can have control and create a polished game while at the same time allowing all of these geniuses to have maximum flexibility.  Also that way, when good mods show up, they are already integrated, rather than being based on some decompiled bytecode and not based on an actual understanding of the game engine.

Mostly separate optional idea: why not add a store where people can pay $.99 or $5 or whatever for a mod if they think it is really good?  That gives Mojang a way to have a constant source of fresh content/features and new revenue opportunities (Mojang takes a percentage of each mod sale) and a way for all of the enthusiastic developers to be rewarded for their efforts.

The store is just an extra idea I am throwing out there.  Maybe it would be better to just have an easy way to list and install free mods, like Garry's Mod has.

You rekindled my enthusiasm for video games at a time when I wasn't playing any at all.

  .

  I'm sad about 0x10c, and I'll tell you why. Grab a cup of cocoa kids, I want to tell you a story. 

  .

  By day, I program things.  All sorts of things.  I program old cash registers, concert lighting systems.  I put out fires at financial institutions as a consultant.  I install/maintain audio distribution systems for drive-in theaters, restaurants and bars.  I use open source technology to teach business owners how to build things like digital signage and small scale inventory systems.  I do 'movies in the park' for local communities.  I've been around a computer once or twice, I guess.

  .

  I stopped playing video games.  During the day, hauling around laptops and always reconfiguring for the environment and dealing with technical issues made me see computers as a source of stress instead of a creative outlet or a source of joy.  For 2 years I owned an XBOX 360 which was only used for Netflix, with absolutely no games ever played.

  .

  So out of nowhere, I find Minecraft.  Wait, digital logic in a game?  No way.  So I see some videos.  I try it out, first the standard mining/farming gameplay then the redstone.  I make a handful of automated chicken farms, some elevators.  My greatest redstone achievement: a small ALU.  You're poking at the inner parts now, expanding my mind on not only WHAT circuit does, but WHY it does it and how it can be a smaller part of a larger process.  So I download Redpower and ComputerCraft and spoiled myself and essentially walked away from the logic.  After all, why not program a general purpose device like ComputerCraft running Lua instead of trying to build all the circuits I need by hand?  Well, it separates you from the actual nuts and bolts of the process you're running.

  .

  ZOMG 0x10c ZOMG announcement, rapid prototyping and development.  DCPU-16 Spec released.  No monitor, no input.  The spec incremented from 1.0 to 1.7 over the course of a few months, moving from statically mapped hardware in memory (Anybody remember 0x8000 and how nobody had really used enough memory yet for that arbitrary address to become a problem? ['64k is enough for anybody!']) to an interrupt mechanism, where every device has full access to RAM and registers.  Different groups release a bunch of compilers, emulators, assemblers, linkers.  /u/xNotch releases a few puzzles to keep us occupied.  That damn pulsar thing drove me nuts, but /r/0x10c cracked it.  DCPU machine code is mildly stable, and people start chatting about C and running Linux.  Someone retargets LCC and someone else rolls their own.  /u/xNotch releases rc-1 and highnerd during all of this.  Rc-1 (highnerd too?) contained a fully operational Java emulator of the DCPU with keyboard and monitor attached.  The Halt and Catch Fire opcode was notably present.

  .

  At this point, everyone and their brother is trying to invent an OS (because that's really all you have to work on for now).  I wrote my own kernel.  It wasn't hard really, just tedious.  Writing routines like getc, putc, print, newline, atoi/itoa really give you a perspective of the scale of an operating system.  Just try to implement a software memory mapper from scratch in assembly...it's a challenge.  So now I've got this kernel that supports everything I can think of and nothing to use it for.  The only officially released gameplay-related device is the Sleep Chamber.  So my userland has a killer spc-control program but not much else besides standard administrivia related to a running workstation.

  Sadly, the community falls apart and the initial wave of enthusiasm is all but forgotten.  All of the pastebins and web-based emulators lay idle.  Eerily, dust seems to settle on your .dasm and .dcpu files.  Your old routines seem stale, not worth your time.  Months ago, you'd stay up late into the night to implement the drivers for your filesystem specification, but you know you couldn't justify wasting any time on it now.

  .

  I'm sad because I'm worried that I won't learn about trajectories, triangulation, link-layer networking, virus engineering and all the other stuff that would come with me being able to connect my DCPU to other peoples' DCPUs.  I guess I could read about all of that stuff but it's just so much more FUN learning it this way.

  .

  It is a great idea.  Hopefully it hasn't burnt out yet.  I miss you, 0x10c hype.

Now those of you who played Mass Effect will know who he is, for those who dont:

The shadow broker is an information broker, his identity is unknown by most, and deals through agents.

My thought was, what if this would be put in 0x10c? Heres an example.

2 factions are at war, Faction #1 would contact the Broker, and tells him he needs information, like security codes, that would allow you to put viruses or self destruct the enemy's ship.

A large sum of money would then be transferred, and the codes were given, which the broker got through his agents.

Now faction #1 has an edge in battle.
