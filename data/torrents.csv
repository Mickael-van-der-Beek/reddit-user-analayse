NOTE: This is a bittorrent oriented guide. Some steps could possibly be used for Direct Download but VPN and Guerrilla tactics is the only thing that comes to mind.

NOTE: There is NO way to prevent yourself from being tracked, but these methods generally should piss off Anti-P2P organizations to screw off as most don't have the legal/technical infrastructure to pursue past things such as VPNs.

1) **VPN**

A VPN, or a Virtual Private Network, in Bittorrent sense, is a way of disguising your IP and encrypting all of your internet traffic so your Internet Service Provider and hackers at coffeeshops sniffing data cannot see what you do online. Many people regard VPNs as a excellent, and easy way of protecting yourself, especially on Public Bittorrent sites such as Demonoid.me, ThePirateBay and isoHunt.

In some cases, they also allow you to bypass ISP throttling for Bittorrent, or may slow your VPN connection speed entirely.


VPNs will likely be outdated in terms of encryption when IPv6 comes out, but right now, it's a awesome solution.

A list of VPN providers who ""claim"" to be P2P friendly. They are not required usually, under their jurisdiction, to claim that they keep logs if they only use it for law enforcement purposes under request or warrant.

http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-providers-really-take-anonymity-seriously-111007/

A Useful guide may be: http://torrentfreak.com/how-to-make-vpns-even-more-secure-120419/

Personally, I prefer to run my own VPN for $10/$15 a year using a cheap 128MB VPS from either BuyVM [the best] or 123Systems [don't respond to support tickets]. You can also use it for other such as running a very small seedbox or web seed, or a bittorrent tracker. The problem with this is that if you use legitimate details, the VPN could be traced back to you, but that's the same with VPNs that use a dedicated IP address who will cut you off, but using a shared IP address could mean a couple of software conflicts.

_Do not use HideMyAss, Expat Shield, Hotspot Shield_ because they datamine/keep logs.

_Do not use ProXPN_, at 300kbp for free, you are going to limit your speeds to around 31KBs/s. Not only that but they do not use a open source client and the level of security is not confirmed to be completely secure.

VPNReactor is unconfirmed to have logs, but you are welcome to use it. They have a 30 minute time limit, then you have to wait another 30 minutes.

*_Do not use TOR or Ultrasurf_*, Although some software take advantage of it, these tools are meant for threatened bloggers, anonymous free speech and whistleblowing, not so you can download the latest Justin Bieber album.

My condolences to Topiary, a international hacker part of Lulzsec, who was caught due to HideMyAss.

*PPTP or OpenVPN?*

Generally PPTP is slightly faster [up to 1.2mbp faster, generally, but not worth it due to the security constraints and often aren't enough to significantly affect any connection], easier to setup and more compatible with mobile devices such as Android [Android v2 has a bug that disables PPTP without notice though] and iPhone, but OpenVPN has much better encryption, can bypass censorship and is better suited for computers and laptops on the go.
There are other protocols but they are less used. L2TPs Use is dwindling, IPSEC is too hard and SSTP is generally only used in networks and countries where PPTP is blocked, as well, it is rarely provided with the exception of StrongVPN, which keeps logs.

EDIT: PPTP IS NOT SECURE. [AVOID PPTP](https://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9229757/Tools_released_at_Defcon_can_crack_widely_used_PPTP_encryption_in_under_a_day). In truth, it is dead. Consider switching to SSTP [or better OpenVPN, or L2TP) though. -ayetoopie


You will likely be caught if you choose a VPN provider that keeps logs and are under constant pressure from Anti-P2P firms.

2) **Seedbox**

Another common suggestion are Seedboxes. Seedboxes are basically machines on high speed connections that can download at speeds of 10mbp, 50mbp, 100mbp, 1Gbit, and up to 10Gbits. These are expensive if you buy dedicated servers, although it is worth knowing that most of these boxes are Kimsufi.ie dedicated servers that are already set up. They don't take much effort to setup though and come with lots of space at a cheap price, also allowing you to setup a OpenVPN if you want at the same price. I recommend going with Kimsufi.ie and setting up your own seedbox if you are up for it, but otherwise, you can cough up the extra 10 dollars and buy from a reputable seedbox provider such as Baconseed.

As a bonus, Seedboxes have the extra space, speed and isolation that you might need. Seedboxes make ratio-keeping much easier on Private Bittorrent sites and allow you to download at lightning fast speeds.

Guide to setting up your own Seedbox: http://filesharefreak.com/2010/02/13/how-to-install-rtorrent-rutorrent-using-socket-ssl-authentication-on-ubuntu-or-debian

Using a Seedbox provider could, at it's discretion and jurisdiction, could release your details if you are traced back them.

3) **Private Bittorrent Sites**

Exclusive websites such as TorrentLeech (I'm so lucky to have a account.) often are faster, better and allow you to find torrents that aren't publicly available like Delta class security clearance items, little-known video games, classified documents or police investigation tools.

You do however, have to keep a good ratio, and if you only leech... Good luck. In order to keep a good ratio, a seedbox or a internet connection that is 10mbp or higher is generally required. 

You also need a invite or you need to signup during open registration. /r/trackers , /r/invites and btracs.com are your friend as well as Google.

Some Private Bittorrent sites sell your information, so use a fake persona whenever possible.

http://torrentfreak.com/filesharing-admin-arrested-for-selling-user-database-120712/

Demonoid (down), BakaBT and other semi-private websites are NOT Private trackers and websites.

However, There is always the chance that a website is fake, or Agents have already infiltrated the website. Still take caution.

4) **Usenet**

If you are willing to pay for a file sharings service on high speed connections that will max out your connection, Usenet is a good choice. I recommend Giganews, which also includes a OpenVPN subscription :) These servers are anonymous and are rarely attacked by Anti-P2P organization, but this is my opinion and people usually don't like Giganews because it's overpriced. Try astraweb or frugalnews if you are more concerned about price.

There are a couple of Free Usenet providers that are very limited, but you should really just purchase a service.
Zombie_rapist recommends http://just4today.net/ if you would just like to try it out.
Others include http://xsusenet.com/ and http://usenetstorm.com/

I cannot vouch for any of them.

5) **I2P**

In short: I2P is a free, open-source, decentralized, anonymous darknet.

VPNs, seedboxes, private Bittorrent sites and the like have one thing in common: they security they provide is mostly based on trust and obscurity. There are anonymization networks that do not rely on trust but rather on their technical architecture to provide anonymity to their users. Tor is one such network, but as has been mentioned already, you should not use Tor for filesharing. However, there is another anonymization network that does allow for filesharing. This is I2P. Your data is sent through multiple other computers running I2P (called I2P routers) before it reaches its final destination. Because the information is encrypted from end to end, no one will be able to see what you are sending, nor will they be able to tell what the source of the data or the destination is (a technical explanation of this is beyond to scope of a quick introduction. visit [i2p2.de](http://i2p2.de/) for more information).

I2P already has a small but active torrent scene. At the moment, you will not find the same amount of content as on the clearnet, but that of course will increase when the I2P torrent scene grows.

It should be noted that I2P is considerably slower than clearnet torrents. If you're all about speed, I2P probably isn't for you. But if you agree that trading off some amount of speed for a highly secure and anonymous way of filesharing is worth doing, then you should definitely give I2P a try!

/r/i2p is a good resource to begin exploring I2P. Feel free to post any questions or thoughts you might have about I2P there.

Note: You cannot use I2P to download torrents from the clearnet, [yet](http://www.reddit.com/r/i2p/comments/121gtf/research_paper_on_i2p_improving_content/).

Credits: This entire section was written by [ayetoopie](http://www.reddit.com/user/ayetoopie). He was nice enough, due to me giving only a passing mention of I2P, to write this out.

6) **Guerrilla tactics**

Downloading using Open Wifi connections, hacked WEP connections and Coffee shops are somewhat, less orthodox ways of downloading without being caught. Though it's somewhat unethical.

Its possible to be caught if it is a honeypot dropper point, but it's extremely unlikely.

7) **Move to another country.**

A list of countries without copyright laws: Eritrea, Turkmenistan, San Marino, US territories [have extradition with the US] Seychelles, Iran, Iraq, Palau, Afghanistan [for a few more months] Somalia, Kiribati, Laos, Sao Tome, Principe, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Nauru. If you decide to leave for Laos or Somalia, bring me back an AK-47.

Some countries where piracy is on a wide scale don't care either. Generally countries such as China, India and United Arab Emirates.

8) **Using a anonymous bittorrent service** 

Services such as OneSwarm, Ares and Anonomos [Didn't spell that right], but I can't provide much details as I've never used them. A reader mentioned I2P, which is a anonymous network, but I have no experience so I cannot vouch.

9) **Software such as Peerblock and PeerGuardian**

 These software privacy oriented firewalls are useless for keeping your IP address from evil people, but they can block further probing such as IP scanning. Anti-P2P organizations can still track you down if you use Peerblock as your only protection, however. The probing can allow tracing of a computer system on a shared connection, e.g. You share a apartment with 3 different people, each with their own computer. Crucial Information such as Operating System, Time of Access, Ping, e.g. can allow this, but usually the owner of the connection or home is sued.

*Note: They don't offer protection, and you are a idiot if you do think it's protection. It does more harm than good, some would say (especially if using private trackers). The most Peerblock is going to do is stop some government and corporate IP scanning.

10) **Stop pirating -_-**

Piracy is bad, mkay? Download legal stuff instead, even though Piracy is nothing more than a excuse.

If you live in a country that allows you to express your opinion/democracy, please contact your representative and ask them to create Net Neutrality, Privacy and Filesharing laws that are more lax or none at all. If your country has one, vote for the Pirate Party, or run as a politician for the Pirate Party :)

Here it is:


1. Avoid hot items, like movies still in the theater or anything that has been released very recently (best to wait at least 1 month after a DVD or video game release).

2. READ ALL THE COMMENTS on the torrent you download. Usually if the copyright holders are watching a torrent, you will find comments on it saying ""I got a letter about downloading this torrent, do not download it!"" But if all the comments say ""great quality, thanks! will seed!"" then it's probably just fine, and there has been no problem.

3. Avoid the most popular torrents. It's tempting to pick the most popular torrent on ThePirateBay because you think it will download faster. But the more popular a torrent is, the more likely it's being watched. It's a numbers game to the studios, because most people actually do ignore the threatening emails. So if they find a torrent with 2000 downloaders and send out 1500 threats, they might get 100 replies, and out of that they might find 2 people willing to cough up money. Their real goal is to scare as many people as possible with the emails, but they still gotta pay the bills (they usually hire crappy little firms to do this ""anti-piracy"" work for them).

4. If you can afford it, use a VPN. This will hide your IP address, making it impossible for them to even find you, and you won't even need to worry about the above 3 guidelines.

5. If you already got a threatening letter/email of any kind, **IGNORE IT**. This is the most important part. The moment you reply to their letter, you confirm that you exist, and essentially admit that you really were the person pirating their content. If you ignore it, virtually 100% of the time they will not bother to follow up in any form.",,False,,t5_2qh0w,False,,,True,t3_16hgqu,http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/16hgqu/guidelines_for_safe_torrenting/,

Recently online, including on Reddit as well as some other websites, I have been reading about how people think torrents are bad, torrents are stealing, etc.

I am sure this is partially people not taking the time to word things properly, but here is the thing, this is not a technicality. Torrents are not necessarily piracy and are not necessarily illegal. This general attitude (and lack of people taking the time to make a distinction between piracy and torrents) gives off the wrong impression.

This is like saying ""Wow, don't YouTube things, that's illegal"" and then it becomes socially unacceptable to YouTube, because it's associated with copyrighted content. Of course this doesn't happen with YouTube but it does with torrents and it's illogical. Torrents are helpful for people who offer free services. People who offer free games, Linux distros or other software online typically offer torrent downloads because it saves bandwidth and saves on server resources. 

It's to the point where some people *literally* believe that torrents and Bittorrent clients are illegal to use (I haven't heard this a *lot*, but it's not unheard of either). **However** it is still against some ISP company's terms of use that you agree to, it's still not against the law.

Torrents are actually pretty helpful. Can I get some support, or am I just being absurd here?",,False,,t5_2qh0w,False,,,True,t3_11vsoi,http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/11vsoi/torrents_are_not_illegal/,

Note: These are open at the time of this post, and may close 5 days after the post, or 5 min.

RuTracker - Ratioless, IMO most like demonoid, entirely in russian (google chrome+translate is suggested)

TorrentShack - gazelle powered, no ratio or seeding rules (*just like demonoid*), scene, p2p

DTN - ratioless, scene, p2p

Libble - gazelle powered, music, share rank system

TheBox - british media, 2012 olympics

TheEmpire - Canadian TV and content

Deviloid - pr0n

Empornium - pr0n

GayTorrents - Gay Porn

ILT - scene, p2p

Speed dot CD - scene, p2p

undergroundgamer - retro gaming

TZT - general

AnimeTorrents - Anime, Manga



**Trackers with Applications and/or Interviews**

What [Interview](http://www.whatinterviewprep.com/) - gazelle powered, Music, hard to seed

HD-Bits - HD Content

TorrentDamage - General

**For Textbooks and elearning**

Please look [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/hrgmv/tracker_with_pdfsebooks_of_college_textbooks/c1xrq44)

**Open Trackers Listings**

IMO, these are fickle and a waste of time, but if you want to follow them, go for it

**Reddit's Consolidated Invite Thread**

Before even thinking about posting in the consolidated invite thread, keep these very important things in mind.

1. Read the original post, then read it again... and then again.  There are trackers who do not want to be shared over public mediums like reddit, and your post will be swiftly removed by a mod if it violates the OP.  If staff from the tracker in question sees your post, he/they may mark your reddit account and watch it closely.  And yes, they are all over this subreddit, /r/trackers, and /r/invites.

2. Make sure your proofs are legitimate.  Everybody has their own subjective opinion of what a ""legit"" proof is, but I can tell you right now that something like a week old speed.cd proof with 3 gigs uploaded and 1 gig downloaded is not going to get you anything.

3. **Demonoid Only Users, please read** - Most people do not consider demonoid proofs to have any legitimacy since it is not private, ratios are calculated inaccurately, and seeding there is very easy.  I made this thread to help users out, not to argue the legitimacy of demonoid, so please do not post arguments regarding demonoid's ""legitimacy.""  Proofs from there mean nothing in the consolidated invite thread

4. Understand that inviters are responsible for invitees, and they are risking their account for you.  They can face negative consequences for your bad actions in the community, some as bad as a ban on the account.  Be Respectful

**closing notes**

Remember to read the rules and faqs of each tracker

Use reddit's search function and sidebar information.  They are great resources.

I read your article about VPNs http://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2013-edition-130302/. I tried out btguard for a month and stopped using it. Tonight I decided to give it another go and I realized I forgot my login name, so I used their forgot my username link and provided the email I had associated with the account. I was disturbed to get my password back in the email as well, not a reset password link or any thing just my password, meaning they store PWs in plain text and don't hash them. I feel like this is a no no for security, especially for a company who is supposed to be providing a secure service. I think this is a particularly poor move on their part and I wont be renewing my service with them. I feel as if this should be something you warn readers about, giving that you have recommended them in two articles about VPN services, the aforementioned one and http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-providers-really-take-anonymity-seriously-111007/.

image of email I got after requesting my forgotten pw after changing it to something more appropriate http://i.imgur.com/vk7MX9G.png. I've changed it again hopefully they don't keep a log of prior passwords.

I deleted my original submission of this post because I had a typo in the title.

edit- response from torrent freak


Hi

Thanks for your email and the information on BTGuard.

The article we wrote doesn't try to assess anything else other than the anonymity offered by any of the providers from a logging standpoint and inclusion on the list is not necessarily an endorsement from us.

That said, we'll seek a comment from BTGuard on the issue but it's probably best if you also take this up directly with them since you're the customer in this instance and the guy handing over money.

Again, thanks for the contact

Cheers!

&gt;There is an element to a torrent that is called the ‘private flag’. It’s a small flag that marks to a client that the torrent is ‘private’ and disables any method of sharing peers (including DHT), except via the tracker. This flag also changes the hash, so peers on a non-flagged torrent could not connect to a flagged torrent in any case. Most private torrent sites check for the flag, and add it if missing when the torrent is initially uploaded to their site. [source](http://torrentfreak.com/common-bittorrent-dht-myths-091024/)

As a private tracker, Demonoid had the private flag enabled so that it could track its users' activity stats. By design, it is impossible to download those torrents without the Demonoid tracker being available. Disabling the private flag from the magnet links would effectively change the torrent, and no peers would be available to download from.",,False,,t5_2qh0w,1346094929.0,,,True,t3_yvntz,http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/yvntz/what_happened_to_the_torrents_previously_hosted/,

I checked, and there were a lot of topics similar to this posted about a year ago. the general trend seemed to be, ""don't pay, they are just using scare tactics. very unlikely they'll actually go through with it to subpeona your information from your ISP and take you to court""

I was wondering if the legal climate is still the same? I couldn't find anything more recent than ""1 year ago"". I read somewhere that the addressed provided is a 200 sq.ft office so probably only 1 or 2 people involved, meaning that it is unlikely that they will go through with taking it to court. I checked and the address remains the same.

Also, i wasn't able to find out if anyone hasn't payed the ""pre-litigation settlement"" and then got sued? Lack of evidence does not provide proof as they say. Can anyone help by mentioning if they heard of anyone getting sued?

The goal is a great client, with all the features you'd expect, but open source and devoid of ads. 

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/PCMRBZn.png) a screenshot if you're into first impressions. The goal of the UI is to be clean, but still informative and useful. EDIT: More screenshots are on [the website](http://sircmpwn.github.com/Patchy/).

Anyway, today is day one of alpha testing. Features include:

* Downloads torrents (from torrent files and magnet links)
* Inline file priority adjustment
* Configurable speed settings
* Encrypted torrenting
* Prioritize torrents for streaming
* Seeding goals
* RSS feed support
* Match feeds with regex and automatically download
* Browse feeds from the application and add torrents directly

I'd appreciate all the help I can get hunting down bugs and getting feedback on the client. If you're up for trying it, you can grab the pre-compiled alpha [here](http://bit.ly/patchy-alpha). You can browse the source code [here](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/Patchy).

Again, this is an **alpha**, and bugs are expected. There are also a few incomplete features. The goal for the alpha is a usable bittorrent client that has most of the features implemented, with few noticeable bugs.

I've only been called out by Comcast once, in more than half a decade of torrenting. At college, I'm fine getting DMCA notices because there, I'm responsible one, but it's harder at home to convince the family that DMCA notices are, for the most part (and not discounting what can actually happen), empty threats.

I really would appreciate a simple run-down of the best things I can do to stay safe while downloading torrents off public trackers.

If you continue to use public trackers you WILL get cease and desist letters from your ISP.

Get on a private tracker. yes, they are difficult to get access to... but, if you're planning to continue pirating material, make the effort to get an invite.

The thing about private trackers is that invites tend to snowball. Once you are in good standing on one site, it's easy to get invites to most of the other sites. (I know, I know, getting onto the first one is the hard part). Most of the larger sites have an IRC channel specifically for invites. With a little bit of torrenting knowledge you can easily earn an invite.

If you need more a reason (other than freedom from ISP letters) to use private trackers, consider the actual content provided. Public trackers do not thoroughly vet the material they host, opening you up to malware, viruses, etc. etc. If a user is found to have knowingly uploaded malware, they can't be ""banned"" since invites are open to anyone.

Whereas private trackers check nearly every torrent, within hours of upload, and CAN ban entire ISP addresses from not just their site, but any other sites they have connections to.

.

Stop using public trackers.",,False,,t5_2qh0w,False,,,True,t3_ju7zf,http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/ju7zf/rtorrents_we_need_to_have_a_little_talk/,

I had the craziest thing happen to me today and I can't find anything online to describe what happened.  

This morning after I work up, I was watching an episode of a vampire show I had downloaded.  I wasn't but 10 to 20 seconds in when all of a sudden my entire screen was taken over by some sort of FBI warning regarding piracy and a small video screen that was using my webcam to take a picture of me.  I immediately freaked out and force closed my computer so it was off.  I also immediately unplugged my router so it didn't have any power.  I didn't have a chance to read the message but it definitely had the words Federal Bureau of Investigation and piracy.  I think the video of me just messed with my head.

I have been looking around the internet to see if anyone had any similar experiences or settle my mind by finding out this is just some virus that I just need to remedy. Until I have this figured out, I look like a total conspiracy nut with a piece of paper taped across my webcam.  I have tried connecting to the internet at public hotspots and duplicate the event so I can get you guys a screenshot of what I saw, but I haven't been able to duplicate it again.

Have any of you heard of this happening or had this happen to you?  I'm kind of an amateur and really freaking out.

EDIT:  I as finally able to get it to do it again.  Here is a screenshot of what it looks like.

If I can do it for under $30/month I'm happy.  

As I understand it now:

1. Get a secure email address (where?  Obviously Gmail is out due to PRISM and all that).

2. Get Bitcoins (how do I pay for these?  Cash for a pre-filled credit card, then buy them?)

3. Sign up for VPN service. (Which one is the best?  Fastest?  Obviously NO LOGGING.)

4. Configure uTorrent to only go through the VPN service (do I need extra software for this?)

Am I missing anything here?

Are there any VPN services that are quick enough that I can do *all* of my internet through them?  (I buy plenty of stuff on Steam, and I stream Netflix all the time, so if I don't need to screw up my internet speeds I'd rather not).

As you can see by the title, I'm having a bit of trouble. I'm running uTorrent 3.3 on Win7 Pro 32bit. Recently, I've encountered a problem. uTorrent will tell me ""Disk Overloaded 100%"" and drop down to about 2.5kbps download speed. I've searched around the net, and apparently this is a recurring problem. I've tried the solution in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/eqn64/for_those_well_versed_in_bit_torrent/) thread. It worked for about a day, and then crapped out on me again.

The torrents I'm getting have a good amount of seeders, so I know that's not the problem. Currently I'm seeding about 76 torrents. Could the problem possibly be that it's too much for uTorrent to handle?

Thanks for any help you can give! If you need more info, feel free to ask.

~~Edit: OP Delivers: the problem (for now) has been solved! I did two things. First, I decreased the total # of seeding/leeching torrents I had (from about 79 to 63). Then, to be on the safe side, I increased my RAM cache from 32 to 512. Things are going smoothly now. Thanks for all the help!~~

Edit2: Okay, so the solution worked. For about 10 minutes. Now I'm back to square one. uTorrent ran just fine for months beforehand, now it seems to be screwing up out of the blue. I hadn't messed with any preferences, so I don't understand where this is coming from.

(Hopefully) Final Edit: After trying a view different remedies, all of which shared the same result as Edit #2 above, I decided to revert to uTorrent v2.2.1. It has worked *great*, and I haven't had a hiccup since. Thanks for everyone's help! I'll be sure to post back if anything changes for any reason, but I'm doubtful that that may occur.",,False,,t5_2qh0w,1369295091.0,,,True,t3_1ds43x,http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1ds43x/utorrent_trouble_disk_overload_100/,

A couple days later I figured out the whole jig on how to torrent and set up the programs/movies. I ended up torrenting probably 97% of all my programs on my computers. Started off with exclusively thepiratebay then my friend gave me an invite to demonoid. I would torrent almost every single day. The first two years I was using Comcast as a service provider, later on switched to Verizon FIOS. 

Years later still never caught. Don't use any proxies or shit but hearing how many people have been caught I might think about looking in to it.

I would very much like to obtain a copy of this torrent.  I understand that you aren't allowed to post links in this subreddit, which I will respect.  Basically, I just want to know how I can circumvent my school's anti-torrenting (getting caught isn't an issue, so don't worry) so that I am able to download torrents.


Also, I can tether from my phone and have an unlimited data plan, but I'm not sure how safe this is.  Anyone who has had experience with this, please let me know.  =)


Any and all advice is appreciated!  Thanks so much everyone!  =D


edit:  I thought I might add that I have a Macbook (will be partitioning to windows 7 after final exams in a week) and that the game I am trying to obtain is The Sims 3.  Also, I have tried utorrent, bitlet, and several other clients, but I cannot get the download process to begin.  Even if there are several seeders, downloading refuses to begin.

edit #2:  Money is a huge limiting factor for me- negative income and no credit card- so buying anything is out of the question.  =(

After my brand new laptop wouldn't start up, I was provided a plethora of options to fix the issue. Most of them didn't work. Something was very wrong with it, and my only option was to wipe it completely and start from scratch. 

I don't want innocent newbies who just want to watch the newest episode of Dexter or reminisce by installing the oldschool version of Roller Coaster Tycoon, or anything in between like getting some music or a shitty cam-recorded movie or god help you some porn, to suffer from their ignorance.

Utorrent was my go to app on my last computer, but it hasn't functioned for over 6 months. (The computer, not utorrent) The tides change quickly. I want to cut away the elitism and mocking and simply help those who are at risk of losing more than what I lost. 

I've been told Deluge is good. Tixati, Qbittorrent have also been recommended. **I'm hoping for an overwhelming, democratic response so future media-seekers have an obvious choice.** You don't have to comment, just vote.

&gt;Read the side bar and quit asking obvious questions.

New people come to this subreddit everyday. I know I didn't come here at all until I installed BitLord and fucked up my shit beyond recognition. I mean it was right on thepiratebay's homepage. (*Why would they [recommend](http://i.imgur.com/pJx9bJT.png) that? I honestly, and naively thought they were the ""good guys"".*) 

&gt;Piracy is illegal and you should feel bad.

Smoking weed is illegal, so is Jaywalking. I just want music that I could easily get for free from YouTube. I want old games that I can't find anywhere else. I am a subscriber to HBOGO and Netflix, but maybe I want the movie on my computer incase I lose internet access. There are plenty of reasons to want to use P2P programs without greedy or lazy motives.

I'm going to ask a lot of questions to anyone who responds. 

&gt;Nice try, NSA.

As long as you aren't planning on bombing anybody you're gonna be okay. (For now, lol)

I know it's a basic question, and most people think the answer is obvious. What's the obvious answer? How can I best protect myself when using P2P programs?

*ANOTHER QUESTION I JUST THOUGHT OF*: What is something that most people don't really think about when they use torrents that they should? 

I know to avoid bundled packages. I know that as programs update, insidious things can sneak into the program that can fuck up your computer in the future. It's pretty obvious that TPB has advertisements set up to trick idiots into downloading malicious software. 

TLDR: Just answer the title question. ",Discussion,False,,t5_2qh0w,False,discussion,,True,t3_1ih51x,http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1ih51x/which_p2p_program_do_you_use_open_discussion/,

Suggestions to fight this?,grumby24,41,15,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/um2ng/help_friend_is_getting_sued_for_a_movie/,"My buddy has received a letter from his ISP which originally came from a court order originated by some law firm looking for his personal information.  They are looking for compensation for someone downloading a movie from his IP address. It is demanding a sum of money to settle.  He has either gotten it down to $3k or believes that is what it will cost to settle.

He doesn't think he actually downloaded the movie in question.  He moved and rented his place out to other people around that time but kept the cable contract in his name so he thinks he is liable either way given that he ""authorized"" the renters to use his internet connection.

The letter went to his old address so he didn't get it until the period to contest (as given in the letter) was over.  

He obviously doesn't want to have to pay for something that he didn't do, but is worried that his options are limited at this stage since he wasn't even aware of the accusation until very recently.  Is there any way he can still fight this?  Would the ISP/law firm have to definitively prove it was him who downloaded the movie and not someone else?  Are there any resources on the web with a step by step method to fight these actions?  What do you suggest he do?

EDIT:
His ISP is Comcast and they contacted him with a subpoena for deposition, he has not contacted them and the date to “quash” it has past so he is assuming the law firm now has his information.

So now he is expecting a settlement letter from the law firm for $1-3k, which he got off from internet articles on the matter. Based on the below he was thinking about just eating the settlement and hopefully negotiating it down to their costs.

Speed test websites report the latency to be between 180 and 210ms (normal for this connection it's 80ms or so), the upload is 1.3mbps (it's a 1mbps line, so I suspect lzo compression may be working some magic) and the download rate was around 6mbps (about what I'd get without the VPN, maybe a teensy bit less).  I was able to completely max my available bandwidth (according to the router) downloading/uploading some videos off private trackers the past 2 days.

So, for those of us without fancy, super-fast interwebs (if you have cable or DSL), it's entirely possible to use an anonymizing VPN 1/3 of the way around the world without any noticeable slow-down torrent-wise.

Bonus: I've tested their service on Windows and Linux, and my Android phone connects without issue as well.  Being able to use it on my phone really made it worth the $6+change it costs per month, as I connect to a lot of open wifi hotspots while I'm out and about.

Workaround: Torrent datapacket spoofing?,aubullion,30,5,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/rr92l/my_isp_throttles_the_crap_out_of_my_connection/,"Disclaimer:  Currently taking 1st year Networking course - knowledge level - noob.

My isp has had some serious SS-style throttling tactics for awhile now and I'm sick of it. I'm fairly certain they are using Sandvine throttling, as launching any torrent during ""peak hours""  causes a complete interruption to all network services. IE: web browsing becomes unreliable - Online gaming is impossible - youtube fails - basically a storm of ""resets"".  Even during ""offpeak"" my download speeds will be burst only, reaching full potential, only to be ""noticed"" and clipped back to under 10kB/s.

However,  I recently noticed something bizarre.  Blizzard torrents are immune.  I've only seen it with World of Warcraft, but my speed was not throttled in the slightest for an 8GB download.  I am on a 75mbit line and was getting 3MB/s consistent and uninterrupted.

It showed tons of peers in the blizz downloader, which may of course be part of it... but it was still using torrent to distribute the data, so why wasn't it getting throttled? 

I think people must have complained about blizzard downloads/gameplay being affected by the throttling and my ISP added it to some sort of exclusion list.

Which brings me to my question:

How are torrent data packets structured... and how do I go about writing a program that masks all torrent data as blizzard data?

**Update:** Thanks for the responses so far.  I just wanted to add that I have been looking into this further and it appears that .edu s are also ""whitelisted"" for both UP and DOWN stream with my ISP.  This is making me believe it could also be IP based exclusions, I know a lot of EDUs host GPL content afaik (Linux, Apache, Etc.).

**Update 2** Just to be clear, I am using encryption with uTorrent.  ALso, I understand the benefits of seedboxes / VPNs, but I am not satisfied with my ISPs idea of service and do not feel I should be forced to pay extra for their convenience and bottomline (lower network loads).

**Update 3** Thanks to another Redditors' shared curiousity, some progress has been made.  Right now it looks like the simplest method to implement and try this is to use the BitComet torrent client.  **By changing the USER_AGENT field to match the Blizzard counterpart, i've seen a 500-1000% increase in bittorrent bandwidth.** Ex.  prior avg = 10kb/s , new avg = 160 kb/s peaking @ 800kb/s.

You might have noticed that in August, [OpenBT and PublicBT were offline](https://torrentfreak.com/largest-bittorrent-trackers-go-offline-in-protest-120716/) because of the lack of development of the protocol.

We have essentially allocated development to a multi-million dollar company, who have created specifications (which are totally open source, yay!) and could sell out bittorrent at any moment.

Why do we still use the old implementation, instead of creating some form of Bittorrentv2 that's open source, ready for development, active in terms of community and isn't controlled by a company?

EDIT: Since when did I say a bittorrent client or tracker? I meant the protocol itself.

And yes, I am fully aware that Bittorrent's specifications are open source, but who gets the say in which to update the protocol, implement new features and ride magic ponies?

1330992553.0,22,self.torrents,qjc8t,Anonymous torrenting (calling network nerds),funk_monk,29,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/qjc8t/anonymous_torrenting_calling_network_nerds/,"Ok, so all this anti piracy stuff has got me thinking. We really need a truly anonymous file sharing service. As of yet I know of none, though tribbler has taken a step in the right direction.

What I propose is something akin to the tor network. Trackers are distributed as with tribbler, however the difference comes from the downloading. Each time you request a data packet, you effectively ask someone else, who then says ""yes, I know where this is and I'll get it for you"". You would then set up an SSL connection with that peer. The peer then asks a seed for the data, and then sets up an SSL connection with the seed using a different key. Packet requests and replies can be delayed a few minutes, obviously increasing latency, but having no impact on overall download rates (I'll explain why this is used later).

The beauty behind this is as follows

* Unless someone is snooping in as a middle node, then it is impossible to tell whether it is genuinely you who is requesting the data, or merely you acting on behalf of someone else. A simple solution I can see is to simply use two middle nodes instead of one, since the chance of both sniffing in is incredibly slim (though this would have the downside of increasing bandwidth use, something of a problem anyway since it's already doubled).
* Deep packet inspection would have no effect since the packets being sent between a seed to a middle node, and the middle node to the consumer would be completely different, due to the different encryption keys used.
* Due to the random delay added, it prevents associations made by linking things together. If a reply was instant and there were few other packets going in and out then it would be reasonable to assume that two immediately consecutive packets were the same thing simply being forwarded on. The delay prevents this since it becomes impossible to make those associations beyond a minute or so due to other connections.
* In doing these things, the nodes are effectively working as individual DNS servers or ISP's, however the difference would be that nothing would be logged. As soon as a connection is terminated then the connection info is permanently removed since it is no longer needed.

The only problem I can see is how to seed anonymously, since you have to broadcast your IP at some point to say that you have the data. If anyone has any suggestions then you're more than welcome. A solution I can see would be that nodes operating on your behalf would become favoured connections. When you start the program, you add your IP to a database of all the people online at any one time (this is constantly updated). Unlike current torrent files, the new proposed files would simply include an identifier. When you initially send out a request for the file, you broadcast this to possibly 1000 different nodes in the network. Each of those nodes could possibly also be a seed for the torrent, or know someone else who is. Once a seed is found, the existing connection with the current nodes is seen as ""preferred"". That way it would be difficult to differentiate a seed from a node since being a persistent connection is no longer identifying as a seed. This way seeds need not actively broadcast what they contain, and could just as easily be mistaken for a node. Over time, a loose database is built up of who knows who, and this can be subdivided to make the chances of finding a seed higher. Here is an example.

* computer A sends out a request to computer B
* computer B says ""yes I have access to this data""
* it is un-knowable whether B is actually a seed, or simply a node that knows a seed
* B could even say ""yes, I have access to this data"", know that it could access that data through C and then so on, with the above rule still applying

If things are to be implemented as above, then there would obviously have to be a fairly quick time out, for example if it results that A knows B who knows C who knows D who knows E ... who has the data in question, then the bandwidth use would be stupidly high. However, the timeout would have to be random, otherwise it may be possible to trace. For example, there is a maximum ""bounce"" depth of 2 (that's the best term I could think of), each time a new node is accessed, the bounce depth is either incremented or decremented, with preference being made on decrementation. If a connection is made that has a resulting bounce depth of 0 then it will go no further. I've probably made a major derp here so please correct me, or provide insight into a better solution if you know one.

However this solution should guarantee anonymity to people merely downloading. The only way to stop it would be to simply ban SSL connections outright since there would be no way of knowing whether the connection was carrying the torrenting protocol or merely an encrypted video feed.

EDIT: I've thought of an additional layer of protection (it was pretty obvious really, now I think about it). Given that persistent connections would be used, it would be possible to use encryption directly between a seed and consumer, the details would just be forwarded by a node. This way a node would have no way of snooping in, meaning that only one node is strictly necessary. Basically we have three computers, A, B and C. B is the middle node. A connection is established from A to C through B. A and C then agree on a key to use. C (the seed) then encrypts all data going out first with the key between it and A and then with the key going to B, thus meaning that B would still be left with an encrypted bunch of data even if he tried to snoop in since B is not aware of the key between A and C.",,False,,t5_2qh0w,True,,,True,t3_qjc8t,http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/qjc8t/anonymous_torrenting_calling_network_nerds/,

I make math education videos and once I have a whole bunch I release them as torrents. I already have 4 torrents out there and have enough to create set number 5. My issue is this:

For this set I bought an HD camera and have been uploading the vids to youtube at **1280 x 720**. The files are **wmv**. Now if i try to create a torrent with the files as they are then the torrent will be huge - **26 videos, approximately 5 hours.**

So my question is this: What video format should I convert these to to reduce the size of the files, but still keep the quality? Is there a program I can download or use to do this as a batch? Or should I just zip them and hope for the best? 

Also I'm **using a PC** *(Microsoft)*. 

Any advice greatly appreciated. 

Thanks. 

**Edit1:** The files vary between **200,000 kb to almost 1 gig**. The videos are between **5 to 30 minutes each**.

**Edit2:** So I downloaded Handbrake as per the recommendations. Awesome software, thank you. I did a test run and converted the 1 gig wmv file (approximately 30 minutes) to an mp4 *(as per recommendations)* file which is now around 400,000 kb. The frame width and height are the same as the original so i know i can reduce the file sizes a lot more by reducing the frame size. **So it looks like this should do the job. Thank you for your recommendations. Peace.**

**Edit3:** I converted the 1 gig file to MKV as well and it's also around 400,000 kb so i think that's the final format i will be using, just resizing it so that it will be a smaller torrent. Thank you everyone.

And even when I had the VPN running it was showing my actual IP and location in the U.S. I e-mailed them a few times and fiddled with some settings at their orders and last I checked it was showing me in Switzerland, woo-hoo. 

I am concerned though: had I not gone to check the VPN's website I would have trusted that the VPN was completely working based on the fact that Google and some other sites were recognizing my Swiss IP and I would have gone on a piracy-parade, unaware that I was half-naked to the digital eyes of anyone and everyone who would like to catch me in the act. So, my question is, what else can I do to test my VPN? How can I be completely sure that it is actually hiding me?",,False,,t5_2qh0w,False,,,True,t3_ydhwg,http://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/ydhwg/how_can_i_be_sure_my_vpn_is_working/,

Is the only real danger of being 'caught' when seeding too much, or is actually leeching torrents dangerous? 

Also, do VPN's work? What's the best one, hopefully free, that has a decent amount of download speed?

I simply use uTorrent, is there something better with some better options?

The timestamps on the email indicated it had originally been sent at 9 pm and then forwarded to me at about 10.30 pm.

I only recently got an internet plan that would allow me the bandwidth to download tv shows, and this is certainly the only file I have downloaded from the Starz stable. Although now that I think about it my girlfriend had also downloaded a few episodes through my home network.

After the email was received I looked in my utorrent and noticed that I had left the file on there and was now sharing it, so I removed the torrent.

What's the story here? How many warnings am I likely to get, and would they have been more upset that I was sharing it rather than downloading it? I've been told you can limit your uploaded data through utorrent, so maybe I was sharing too much. I don't do much downloading at all and so am a bit of a noob, and am just surprised they got on to this so quickly.

Nothing  

So, obviously they have finally gotten smart or I don't know what else.  This comes at a bad time because House and Dexter are about to start and I can't afford the on campus cable.  

So any ideas?  Is there anyway to bypass this by enabling other ports?  Is there a free web browser html client I can use instead of utorrent?

Everything is working smooth now.
