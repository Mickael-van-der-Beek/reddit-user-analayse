hey bushcrafters, merry holidays! i'm new here. here are some arrows i've been working on. 2 of the shafts are wild rose, 1 is birch and one is butterfly bush. the points are made out of local flint and jasper i've found. i have nicer obsidian points i have made, but i'm trying to be as accurate as possible in terms of material when it comes down to what the natives would have used in my area. the fletching are turkey tail and wing, along with one or 2 red tailed hawk feathers. pounded deer sinew and pine/charcoal pitch for securing the head. i still need to wrap the feathers and knock, i cheated a little bit and used super glue to tack them in place. in making these i've already learned alot, mainly that i will be more consitant in material when making the next set. i went out last week and cut 25 red osier dogwood shafts and 25 wild rose shafts. i realized i did not cut second year growth on a lot of the wild rose so most of those are out the window. i also picked up a dead turkey vulture on the road and got some really sweet feathers. i am also going to scrape the next batch to the same diameter. thanks for looking!",,False,self,t5_2qnfs,False,,,True,t3_15e6pu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bushcraft/comments/15e6pu/new_to_reddit_i_love_browsing_rbushcraft_so_here/,

We thought about getting everyone a proper bushcraft axe, either a Wetterlings or a Gränsfors Bruks.  But then we realized we would have to spend the majority of our own holiday season listening to the arguments over who got the better deal. That idea was out.

We then turned towards a Mora, but then we found out that shipping a blade to some of you might not be legal, and we didn't want to spend our holidays in the lockup.

Then this fellow we all like decided he was going to show us up, and announce a truly amazing gift.  So instead of sending you each something, we figured it would be easier to just scribble our names on his gift when he wasn't looking. That should do, right?

So [Thanks Ray](http://www.raymears.com/blog/wild-britain-with-ray-mears-series-3/) for making the life of a moderator a little easier this holiday season.

1336588014.0,19,self.Bushcraft,tf2bc,"I've been practicing the hand drill for over six months, and I finally got a coal!",allaboutwe,22,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bushcraft/comments/tf2bc/ive_been_practicing_the_hand_drill_for_over_six/,"Now I'm busting them out right and left. It took me a while to get here, though. I'm happy to share what I've learned along the way, for any aspiring hand-drillers!

EDIT: Glad to see people are interested, I'll just post what I've learned here.

1) Practicing a little, frequently, is much more effective than practicing a lot, sporadically. For example, I keep the kit on my desk at work (I use nice-smelling woods, so it doesn't bother people). I will take 10-20 minute-long breaks throughout the day, make a little bit of smoke each time, then go back to what I am doing.

2) My hands! Practicing for more than a few minutes will form blisters very quickly. This is another reason for frequent spurts of activity, it keeps me from ruining my hands. After a while I began to find my ""edge"", where I knew that if I kept practicing, I would damage my hands. Each day I try to bring my hands just up to that edge, then I back off and let them heal overnight. Figuring out this balance made a world of difference in my progress.

3) Process over product. If I ""try to get a coal"", I am much less likely to have success than if I try to maintain the best technique I can. As soon as I start wanting a coal, it becomes much harder to produce. It's kind of like talking to girls, it doesn't work if you want it too badly.

4) An expert hand-driller, to the naked eye, looks exactly like a beginner. Both are just spinning a stick in their hands. The really difference is on a subtle level that only the driller can feel. 

5) Being able to bust a coal does not mean I am able to start a fire. I am discovering that the tinder bundle is a skill in itself, and it will take considerable practice to become proficient with.

6) People are very impressed by seeing someone make smoke, coal and fire with their hands. Especially children. I was demonstrating to a class of kids, and when I started to make smoke, one girl exclaimed ""THAT'S MAGIC!""

7) The more I learn about anything, the more I learn about everything. I've picked up concepts from this learning process that have helped me in martial arts, yoga, music, and believe it or not, relationships.

8) The amounts of speed and pressure that I need vary thoughout the process. When I am making dust to fill the notch, pressure is more important. When I am attempting to ""light"" the dust to turn it into a coal, speed is more important.

EDIT II:

9) Learning to enjoy the process was critical. At first, I was frustrated that it was so hard to produce a coal. Once I found enjoyment in improving my technique little-by-little, I started to have ""mini-victories"" that fed my spirit to continue to press forward.

UPDATE: Just busted my first coal with a cattail reed. Haven't identified the wood, it's a bit harder and lighter-colored than the red cedar I've been working with. Doesn't smell as good, either.

An FYI for those interested. This bottle is a stainless copy of a widemouth Nalgene 32-oz bottle that found it's way into the kit of many bushcrafters.  Manufactured by Guyot Designs and now distributed by and marked Nalgene.     The absence of this bottle has been noticed, and complained about on other forums for some time, (and I saw them going for well over $40.00 in some places.) A similar model (the backpacker) Has been more or less available this whole time, but never quite reached the popularity of the standard due to size and tapered bottom.  Good bottle, meh pot, and nesting/wobbly issues. I sent an email to Nalgene about 1.5 yrs ago asking about availability, and they claimed Guyot had failed to have them produced due to their own problems.  I would receive and email when (and if available again).  Didn't get the email, but checked and they are back in stock.      

They have been hard to find for a while, and subsequently fetching a fairly high price.  $27.00 is not *too* ridiculous, and if they are the same quality as the original Guyot it seems fair for a buy once cry once bottle/pot. I have an older one, and It is part of my BOB gear in a cook kit.  Single wall SST and was originally touted as being appropriate for cooking in. I ordered a new one, and will report if the quality is less/more than it was, or if it has changed.  My old one is the same dimensions as the plastic Nalgene wide mouth 32-0z.  Human Gear Cap Cap fits dandy, and nests great inside GSI 18-oz camp cup.  Both of which fit inside a 5.11 or Condor water bottle holder.  I prefer the Condor, it is insulated well, has a pocket, and is good quality for imported goods.  There are plenty of reviews and pics out there for them already.

1. What water stone should I get?

2. Should I get a water stone?
A: It's seeming like the best option for me right now.

3. What grits should I get?
A: I would guess since my knife doesn't have to be extremely super duper sharp that 220, 1000, and 3000-5000 would be good. 

Thank you in advance, cheers.

EDIT 1: After further research: I am not sure I need anything below a 1000 grit stone. In Ray Mears' video he only uses 800, 1200, and 6000, I'm sure his knives take heavier use than mine are. I'm thinking a 1000/4000-1000/6000 will be just fine, but I'm not completely sure.

3. **What tools are absolutely critical? So far I've gotten knife, handsaw, hatchet/axe, however what about things like flint and steel, kindling, fishing line, other things like that?**

4. **How many clothes do you bring? two sets and just wash them, one set? Is there a rough guideline for how many clothes to bring?**

From /u/PapaShane about Jeans and hiking/backpacking

Jeans are bad because they don't dry quickly, they absorb water readily, and they provide very little insulation when they are wet...the adage goes, when in the wilderness, cotton kills. Having said that, I've backpacked in jeans plenty of times and I'm still around to tell of it. In the summer when it's hot though, it's nice to have lightweight poly blend or something along those lines, something quick-drying and breathable and light but still tough enough to withstand brush. I'm also not a fan of convertible (zip-off) pants, the zippers annoy me...I like my shorts to be shorts and my pants to be pants. In the winter months, it's good to have some sort of synthetic soft shell pants or something along those lines...I would avoid jeans in the winter because that's when the cotton has the best chance to kill you. Of course, hiking-specific pants tend to be pricey. Check out military surplus stuff, you should be able to find some cotton-poly blend or whatever at army-navy stores. If you have the cash, prAna, Mountain Hardwear, Columbia, North Face, etc etc all make nice hiking pants and shorts, and they really are better than jeans I promise.


5. **Boots, do I just bring one set? Bring boots and other shoes, etc (anything footwear related)**

6. **Any little trinkets that youve brought that youve found essential (I'm looking for miscelaneous items you should bring that would help you whether its books or other things)**.

From /u/vlehto Just wanted to add to your trinkets list:

Water bottle (simplest you can find is probably good enough)

Cup

Spoon

Toilet paper

Dish washing brush and some hand washing-up liquid

Toothbrush and some paste

A towel

Bandages and roll of that thing you wrap around bigger wounds

Nice to have:

Nail scissors

Safety pins

Plastic bags

Cotton bags for your clothes(this way you don't need a backpack with million pockets)

Good book

Little duct tape

Fishing line and few hooks

The new wiki makes it incredibly easy for everyone to help add sections, fix errors, etc.  It is also built-in to reddit, following the form and function of reddit.com.  We even have the ability to auto-generate a ""discussion"" thread for a particular page, and further features are being planned and added.

I would like to invite everyone to take a look at our wiki, and participate by helping us make it a great resource.  It should be incredibly simple now, and if you run into any problems, just message the mods and we will work to resolve your problem.

Friends, we thank you for your support, your time, and your interest. This petition reached over 10,000 signatures just before we arrived at the NC Building Codes Council meeting in December. Eustace made a very compelling plea before the entire council and though the time was short, we were well received. In the coming months we are hoping to hear back about how the council will begin to address the lack of applicable codes to primitive camps in this state. We plan to hold our summer camps beginning in June and hope that you will stay closely in touch as the events unfold.

It is our primary intent to stay true to the integrity of our methods. We will not compromise our mission in an attempt to modernize or meet completely inapplicable codes. Turtle Island is a non-electrical, non plumbed, alternative living space for humans and nature to coexist as one. Please continue to keep in touch and we thank you for your support.

Our Spring ""Turtle Tracks Newsletter"" will be out in about 1 week. Please send a brief email to: mail@turtleislandpreserve.com - if you would like to receive a digital copy.

Long time lurker, first time poster. 

I've been an outdoors kind of guy since I was a kid. I regularly spend days at a time in the woods near me and am ready to take it to the next level. 

I'm looking for a new location to spend some significant time, as I have no family or job responsibilities to deal with (I own a small business that allows me near complete freedom to do as I please, as long as I check in every few weeks)

Anyway, I've recently hired some people to take over my responsibilities so I can take an extended leave and just be alone for a couple months in the wilderness. 

However, I've yet to choose the location. That's where you come in. 

Where would you choose to spend 3-4 months alone in the wilderness?

I'll be planning at least 3 trips to my chosen location in preparation to make sure I can handle the location and all it's flora and fauna.

Average Temperature: 35 C
Property: Camp has a large forest on property which consists mostly of grasses, ponderosa pine, a few random leafed trees and bushes. We are also situated right on a lake. 
Special Notes: The area has a total fire ban on right now due to our areas risk of forest fires. So instruction on how to light fires is out.

I had split the wood previously with a big blunt maul, and had success with some of the logs (but others it just dented the wood and didn't go through).  That was earlier in the fall/winter, and I don't think they were frozen then.

It could be that the axe arrived pretty dull and needs sharpening, but I've read that frozen wood can be harder to cut with a chainsaw.  I've also seen someone say it's actually easier to split with an axe, though.  Anyone have any idea?

I've figured out the basic mechanics of both the overhand and underhand throwing techniques, but my aim isn't quite there yet. I either release too early or too late. When i throw underhand the stones usually go flying on a long arc, which I understand is kind of the point of that technique, but it still seems like I could dial it in a bit more. Overhand, I get a more precise trajectory and can even hit the same area on the ground downrange, but i'm not actually aiming at that point. It just seems like I can't find that sweet spot for release.

I'm deadly with a throwing knife, and I can stick a tomahawk pretty consistently as well so I know if I can execute that optimal sling technique a few times I will be able to repeat it. 

By far the sling has the toughest learning curve of any primitive weapons that I've used in the past. I put it second on the list, harder to use than an atlatl, but not as difficult as a boomerang.

I've looked at youtube videos, but I would like to read some step-by-step directions to help me further break down the process. Any tips, tweaks, favored techniques, or links to the above information would be greatly appreciated!

I don't mean to start any debates or controversy.  I am just curious: What are your political/philosophical views and how do they relate to your interest in bushcraft (if at all)?

The knife I currently use (buck 119) has sort of two tapers on the blade (I don't know if there is any sort of terminology for that).  By that I mean, it tapers from the middle of the blade, and then there's another taper to the edge.

I've been looking at some bushcraft blades, though, and it seems like there is only one taper from the middle of the blade to the edge.

Here's an example: http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8291/7806122906_7f2251ab6d_b.jpg

My questions are: 1) do they actually have blades like the latter? or am I just seeing it wrong?
2) is one type of blade better than the other?  Is the blade with only one taper easier to sharpen or anything?  (I've sharpened my buck knife, but have never gotten it razor sharp)
3) What is the purpose of either type of blade?

A lot of Dave Canterbury's video's (and other people's too) on you tube mention Bank Line as an alternative to Paracord. 

I'd like to buy some to test it out for myself but I'm struggling to find a supplier (I'm in the UK).

I'm guessing it's primary use is to do with fishing but a couple of trawls (no pun intended) through a few fishing tackle suppliers hasn't turned anything up.

Is ""Bank Line"" a trade mark, is there another name for it I should be searching for? Does anyone know a (cheap) supplier in the UK?

I was trying to use a piece of dry cat tail and some [weeping] willow wood for a hand drill, as I had heard those work well.  When I got down to it, though, the willow wood seemed to be getting polished.  It was a bit punky though, so maybe it was too rotten and soft?  I have heard that a good idea is to put in some salt or sand to add friction so that the wood doesn't smooth out.

My questions are: 1) Are there any other good ways to prevent polishing?  and 2) What are other wood combinations that are good for making a hand drill? (I live in the midwest.  I've heard maybe maple/ash as the drill and sycamore as the board)

First off - thanks to everyone for subscribing.  We have gone from barely 60 subscribers a few months ago to over 2,300!  I personally have loved watching this subreddit grow as people post there stories and questions.  Thanks again for making this happen.

Now back to the business at hand.  If you will take notice in our sidebar, we now have some upcoming events listed.  The events are things to do outside of /r/bushcraft - such as a wilderness expo, free park admission day, or a public demonstration.  This is something new we are going to try.  The purpose is just to give everyone another excuse to get outside more, and to keep our community updated on what is happening around us.

We would like to maintain a ""master list"" of these events in our [FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/bushcraft) - keep in mind that anyone should be able to make changes here.  Based on the master list, we will keep the sidebar updated on what is happening.  So if you know of any events, please add them to the [FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/bushcraft).  If you can't for some reason, just let us know and we will add them for you.

One person can't keep up with all of the events that are happening around the world, so we are relying on you to keep us informed.  It doesn't have to be something coming up this week/month/year- and it doesn't have to be something you are going to attend personally.  If you know about it, let us know about it. If you are planning something, let us know about it so we can possibly add it.

Again, this is something new, and it will evolve over time depending on our community's needs.  So keep posting content, let us know about your events, and be sure to head out to one of the events listed when the times comes.

I wanted to try using it alone with the paracord I have wrapped on the sheath to improvise a spear. The drop point tip of the LS makes it well suited to the task as it forms a stronger point. To start out I chopped a sapling [with nice easy strokes.](http://imgur.com/a/fhQYl#4) I was surprised at how easy the LS chops for it's size. After that, I split the smaller diameter end via baton chopping with a piece of dead fall. After notching some divots to hold the paracord I [slid the blade in.](http://imgur.com/a/fhQYl#2) (without the grips) Here's where I would do something different next time. I should have split another slice leaving a gap rather than simply splitting the end. This would give a snugger and more even fit for the tang. I secured by wrapping in a method similar to what I've seen Les Stroud do on Survivorman. Again, something I would do different is shaving the sides of the end to give myself a more snug fit for the coradge and allow it to wrap more evenly. [For all intents right now though, it held fast.](http://imgur.com/a/fhQYl#0) End result, I have a [decent 7 foot lance.](http://imgur.com/a/fhQYl#3) It stabs deadfall really well, and withdraws without dislodging the blade from the stick. As a thrown weapon it would work, but the stick I chose is too heavy to allow it to stay in without falling back out. Of course it would do a fair amount of damage if thrown, but accuracy would be better served by a lighter setup. Here it is stuck [in a log.](http://imgur.com/a/fhQYl#1) Best uses for this set up would be defending against or hunting snakes, or defending against a predatory animal.

What other knives do you know of that are similar and fit the price point that would be worthy of a look?

In truth this is almost more of a market research question, but I've been a lurker here for a couple of months and thought this would be the best place to look for some advice!

Basically, I first got into Bushcraft when i was about 15 thanks to a healthy supply of army freebies (stoves, pots, water bottles, etc.) from various family members serving in the armed forces. I really enjoyed the physical aspects of the craft, particularly shelter making and fire lighting, and used to practice both in this nearby abandoned quarry (long since overgrown) pretty regularly (don't worry, I never created any infernos; I just really enjoyed the satisfaction of turning a tiny spark into a decent flame). Anyway, I also enjoyed the planning aspect, such as designing the perfect kit bag, or convenient cooking system, etc. The result of which was the creation of my very simple tinderbox (or rather tindertin) which I put together within my first couple months.

Basically, it was composed of a semi-waterproof shoe polish tin ([here!](http://www.surplusandadventure.com/images/product/main/g_kiwi_shoe_polish.jpg)), filled with charcloth, and containing a small (yet effective) flint and steel i trimmed to fit within the tin itself.

Anyway, I've recently had a bit of time free and out of curiosity was looking over some fire lighting methods around the web and realized i couldn't find any basic tinderboxes like mine anywhere, and hence have considered making a few to try and plug to a few local outdoor stores in the area.

Main product details are:

- Waterproof tin (rubber sealant)

- Compact (diameter of around 8cm (maybe less))

- Reliable (Nothing like charcloth for catching sparks)

- Cheap (around 5 GBP, or 7/8 USD).

Note: I've already looked quite extensively into production costs (packaging, unit cost. etc) and could afford to keep the RRP pretty low whilst still maintaining enough profit to make the venture worthwhile (I'm not exactly going to be able to quite the day job, but a little extra cashflow is always appreciated)).

So r/bushcraft... any interest?
- Not that I even know if I'm going to try yet, but honestly if you saw one on the shelf, would you be tempted to buy?

**TL;DR: Would you ever consider buying a 8cm, waterproof, ""TinderTin"" containing a flint and steel as well as a healthy amount of charcloth? (for around 8 US Dollars)**

Something like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bushcraft/wiki/pages)

I thought too, that /user/survivalcraft had agreed and was going to make it so.

It seems one or both of us did not make ourselves clear.

As it is, when you click on the wiki you go to a page that in my opinion should sub pages.

eg..

* What is bushcraft

* Events or Calendar

as well as having links to any new pages, for instance the **Locations** page, which at the moment no one can find unless they saw the thread regarding it.

More like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bushcraft/wiki/pages)
minus these of course, 

* config

* description

* sidebar

* stylesheet

With minimal text. What I'm saying is the index should be an index.

If there are no objections, I'll go ahead and make it so. It should be
clear what I'm getting at once you see it, if it isn't yet. It will be easy
enough to change it back if you don't like it, but I'm pretty sure that won't be the case once you see what I mean.

I won't do anything until this thread gets some response.",,False,self,t5_2qnfs,False,,,True,t3_15zd86,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bushcraft/comments/15zd86/concerning_the_wiki/,

The length of the blade is 9.5 inches and is .15 inches thick.  It feels much lighter than it looks.  This blade has been useful but is a bit overpriced for what it does.  A good solid machete will do most of the tasks that this knife is good for.

Lets look at what this blade is good at, it makes a very good chopper, the size lends itself to any task you would use a small machete for, clearing brush, chopping small trees and saplings and cutting high grass in areas around your camp.  Last year at a bushcraft meetup I needed to clear out an area of hight grass to keep out the snakes and such and in a couple of minutes i was able to cut the grass in a very large area.  The blade is light and swings well and you forget its on your belt very quickly.  The pouch on the sheath is large enough to hold a full size multitool and when i am in the bush my Leatherman Wave usually rides in there.  The sheath is tough and works well, it has a snap that holds the blade in place and the belt loop is very large, you can fit a USGI pistol belt in it with room to spare.  The handle is very grippy and work well even when wet.

The steel is fairly soft and after a year of medium use it has a small warp in the edge of the blade, it holds and ok edge but sharpens easily.  The saw on the back of the blade is better than nothing but is not something I enjoy using for any length of time.  It is only a pull cut saw so it only works on the backstroke.  The blade is full tang with a hammer on the base but it is a very thin hammer and is only so so for driving spikes and such.

The knife has done its job but for 40 dollars I would recommend getting a good machete or one of the versions of the knife that does not have the saw on the back of the blade as it destroys a baton fairly quickly and the saw is not very good.  You can pick up a good folding saw, a machete and a small mora for about the same money as this knife and they would probably server you better.   If you are limited to one tool this will do all the jobs, but like many jack of all trades it does none very well.  for pics go to www.roundrockoutdoors.com",,False,self,t5_2qnfs,False,,,True,t3_1c5iy6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bushcraft/comments/1c5iy6/sog_jungle_primitive_review/,
