The TL;DR copied from the above link is:

I wrote almost all of the builds on GosuBuilds. Fed up with the owner of the site only wanting money and not contributing at all, I offered to buy the website. Couldn't afford (and was unreasonable to give) the ridiculous $1000 he asked for, so I left the website. My new website is [IMBAbuilds](http://imbabuilds.com), a build order site I will constantly update made exclusively for the community.

Thanks /r/AllThingsProtoss for all the support and feedback you've given me in recent times.  I've taken a lot of it into consideration and I've truly tried to make this site the best I can based on you guys' comments.  Sorry for those who have checked GosuBuilds recently and not seen any updates: I don't have access anymore to the site so couldn't alert you.  And sorry for not getting this up and running faster - I was moving home from college in the past week and things have been rather hectic.  

I'll answer any questions you might have either here, in the /r/starcraft post, or by email.

I have been collaborating with the fellas over at ATT and we want to run a tournament, but include every division!! 

NA ONLY.

Yes that means you bronze silver and gold you are in the lower division. Plat and diamond are in the next and masters and GM are in the top division of the tournament.  It will be a bracket play and not an all kill play.  There will be 6 players for each division, for example two bronze, two silver, and two gold and goes the same for the other two.  I will take a pool of the names that are put in the COMMENTS of this post and divide them up and pick them out of a hat so that there is no one sided choices for the lower two divisions.  For the masters and GM part I and our mods will hand pick them to represent us.  

When will this all happen? We plan on it being next week.  Dates are subject to change, but from the guys at ATT it sounds like next week is good for them. The times will be more than likely during the day/afternoon and it will be a Saturday/Sunday event.  

Who will cast? We are still figuring that out. We would like to get multiple casters for the lower league games and then one big one for the masters/GM games.  This will allow people to see the entire range of our communities as far as skill goes and giving people a fun opportunity to be casted! 

Bracket system? That will be determined soon enough, I figure it will be a best of 3 or a best of 5 for the lower divisions per players, more than likely Bo3 and in the finals of the bracket, it will be a Bo5.  For the masters/GM it will more than likely follow the same format, but again things are subject to change! 

What do I win? PRIDE AND HONOR FOR AIUR. In all seriousness though the winner of the bracket for each division will be getting reddit gold funded by the mods from our subs and then the overall winner of the tournament, which sub has the most wins total, gets to pick the banner for the losing sub and they have to have it up for a week!  Also tons of bragging rights.  I mean  its not like we are 1-0 as far as tournaments go....just saying....Also I will more than likely throw in some steam games as the days go on for the winners or if I feel like it.  I have half life games and maybe portal and 6 dota2 keys to give to people! So there are your incentives!!

How do I get my name in the drawing pot? COMMENT ON THE POST. As I stated above comments will get your names put in the pool and drawn! As far as the masters/GM people go, they can PM me if they would like to remain hidden or not seen for their various reasons, that is OK because I am hand picking them.  

When will I find out? This week! I will leave this thread up for a few days and then look at it and put everything in for the drawings and announce it via a post and a PM! Masters/GM maaaay take a bit longer, but that's because they are going to be hand picked. 

So there ya have it! Sorry for the wall of text but it was needed! Comment, spread the word, tell your friends ATP is looking to kick ATT's ASS!!!

**Core build**  
9 Pylon  
13 Gate  
14 Assimilator  
16 Pylon  
18 Cybernetics Core  
19 Zealot (Naniwa cancels this zealot before it finishes so he can get his Nexus up slightly faster)  
*Cut probes at 23 supply  
*Cancel Zealot  
*Start warpgate  
21 Nexus @ 3:45  

**Variation 1** (Fake Zealot pressure into Phoenix)  
21 MSC  
*Resume probe production  
23 Zealot  
25 Pylon @Natural to wall  
27 Sentry  
30 3 Gateways + Pylon @ 5:00  
*Push out with MSC and zealot and keep the sentry at the natural  
@150 Gas Stargate @ 5:55  
*Naniwa did not spot a 3rd base a faked early aggression in this game against Jaedong so he did not warp in 4 zealots and instead recalled.  
@6:20 3 assimilators  
Phoenix(4-5) when Stargate finishes *Chronoboost  
Robo Facility and Forge after first phoenix

**Variation 2** (Zealot pressure into Phoenix or Void Ray)  
21 MSC  
*Resume probe production  
23 Zealot  
25 Pylon @Natural to wall  
27 Sentry  
30 3 Gateways  
*Push out with MSC and zealot and keep the sentry at the natural  
@150 Gas Stargate @ 5:55  
*Naniwa spotted a third base from Sortof and delayed his gasses in favor of warping in zealots  
Warp in 4 Zealots @6:30  
@6:40 Assimilator  
*If zealot aggression is working feel free to warp in another round of zealots and use time warp with the MSC, if not, recall is a safe option  
Assimilators at the natural when you have the minerals  
Phoenix(4-5) or  Void Ray(1) when Stargate finishes *Chronoboost  
Robo Facility and Forge after first phoenix  

**Variation 3** (Fast Phoenix)  
21 2nd Assimilator  
*Resume probe production  
22 MSC  
24 Pylon @Natural to wall  
26 Stargate  
27 Zealot   
30 2 Gateways to wall  
32 Sentry  
*Fake Pressure with you zealot and MSC  
36 Phoenix(4-5) when Stargate finishes *Chronoboost  
@6:30 2 assimilators  
@7:30 Add Robo Facility and Forge   

**Variation 4** (Oracle into Immortal Sentry Oracle All in)  
21 2nd Assimilator  
*Resume probe production  
22 MSC  
24 Pylon @Natural to wall  
26 Stargate  
27 Zealot *Naniwa cancels this zealot right before it finishes as well so the sentry and oracle will be started at 34 and 36 supply respectively if you didn't skip this zealot  
30 Forge and Gateway to wall  
32 Sentry  
34 Oracles(3) *Chronoboost  
@6:20 2 Assimilators  
Pressure the zerg with the oracles and MSC using time warp to pick off queens  
@7:15 Robo Facility  
@7:30 +1 Attack  
*Stop Probe production @~46  
*When Robo Finishes Chronoboost 2 immortals and a warp prism  
@9:00 Add 5 gateways  
@10:00 Move out w/ ~8 sentries and 2 immortals, warp in stalkers  

**End Game Goals**
Besides Variation 4, which is an all in build, you should be looking for a certain end game composition depending on what you scout.  Constant scouting using hallucinated sentries is a must.  After the Robo Facility finishes you should be looking to add a Robo Bay for colossus to counter hydras that the air opening may have forced.  If you scout a spire with your hallucination instead of hydras, add another 2 Stargates and begin phoenix production.  From the forge, research +1 Attack and +1 Armor, adding a twilight council which will be used to research Charge, +2 Attack and to build a templar archives.  Look to take a third base around 10:30-11:00.  Against roach hydra viper composition, use templars to attempt to feedback the vipers.  Against an ultralisk composition you want 3-4 colossus and immortals with lots of zealots and archons.  Against a muta switch, phoenix and high templars are ideal.

**Note**  
*Put your first pylon next to your nexus in case of early pools  
*This build does not scout so the first zealot is made in case of an early pool and is cancelled if there are no lings  
*Time warp is great for picking off queens off creep during your early aggression

Yes, that's right, you can see 1 unit further than a scanner sweep. This is *phenomenally* good if you're clever and careful. You can scout the edge of bases without the enemy ever seeing you. You can have full vision up a ramp and the enemy won't even know you're there. You can see farther than a siege tank can shoot. Seriously, load up a custom game or something, play around with it, and then watch the replay from your opponent's view.

One thing I've been playing around with is using the MSC to spot for Tempests. Tempests have 15 range but only 12 sight. The MSC's sight means that you can see to max attack range by only being a single unit in front of your Tempests. This keeps everything nice and safe while still allowing your Tempests to be obnoxious as hell.

I'm sure you guys can use this knowledge better than I. Seriously though, abuse the hell out of the sight range, it's so good.

Edit: Something else I just thought of. If you're opening Oracles vs T (or really anyone), poke around for turrets with your MSC before your oracles get there. It won't save you vs hidden widowmines, but you can save precious seconds by not flying in to the wrong side of the base *and* Terran won't know you're scouting out Oracle entrance paths.",,False,self,t5_2tkqb,1363788098.0,,diamond,True,t3_1an8fd,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/1an8fd/abuse_the_mothership_cores_14_sight_range/,

It's very very powerful!! At one point MC killed off something like 15-20 marines and 14 scvs with 4 oracles :O

MC's 4Gate Oracle build in PvT
_____________________________

9 Pylon

13 Gateway

2x Gas on ~15

16 Pylon

18 Cybernetics Core

Hide the next pylon in a corner of your base

Warpgate/Stalker (chronoboosted)

Mothership Core

Stalker

Stargate at hidden pylon &gt;:D

Sentry

Start chronoboosting oracles out of the stargate. After the starting the first one build a Nexus at your natural

Keep building oracles and throw down 3 more gateways as you can afford them. MC has been going up to 4 Oracles.

Now from here the idea is to have 4 Oracles and a Mothership Core harassing the main while having gateway units consisting of mostly Stalkers hit the front. Split up Terrans units. If this build is unscouted or they don't have enough turrets and Vikings you will just shit on him. If you want you can also have the gateway and stargate units together and just attack the front using Timewarp to slow the units and let the Oracles melt everything. A lot of Terrans have been opening with widow mines, so be careful of those as they will 1 shot an oracle! Just remember to use the Oracles Detection ability to kill of any widow mines at ramps or in mineral lines so your attack goes smoothly. Also pretty much the whole time you want to be spending your chrono on probes!

__________________________________________________
MC's Gateway Pressure with MS Core
_____________________________________________

This build is pretty much a variant of the gateway pressure openings with a lot of sentries in WoL but now with a Mothership Core!

9 Pylon

13 Gateway

15 Gas

18 Cybernetics Core

18 Zealot

Warpgate Research

Chrono a stalker

Nexus

Mothership Core adding on a 2nd gas after

Sentry

Add 4 Gateways and make sure you start saturating the natural base

Start warping in sentries as soon as the Gateways are up. Also get a proxy pylon up somewhere by his base.

Attack the front with around 5 sentries, stalkers, zealots, and the Mothership Core. It really helps if you try to focus the bunkers down (if he has any) while casting Timewarp on the scvs coming to repair. I apologize if I got any of this wrong, feel free to comment on anything I missed on this one, I think I got it right though. 

One more thing, I actually saw a lot of Blink Stalker play this weekend from guys like MC and Feast and one thing I've noticed is that using a Mothership Core for obtaining high ground vision instead of robo is very interesting and allows you to use time warp offensively as well as not have to spend resources getting a robo! Just make sure you don't lose your MS Core!!!

Hopefully these help, I apologize if there are any mistakes, I'm pretty tired and I don't main Protoss so I might have not caught a few things, but I'm pretty sure these are accurate :D

This thread is mainly for having people chime in on the optimal times of things that are consistent among higher level players so that everyone can learn from it.

For example. 

a 6 pool will optimally go down at around 0:41. it takes the spawning pool a minute and depending on the map, it'll take anywhere from roughly 30 seconds to 45 to get to your base. This means if you scout a 6 pool and you are fast expanding, you have until roughly 2:45 to get a complete wall off, seeing as lings take 30 seconds as well. 

_

(*Edit: timing*) A normal stalker will pop out around 4:15 meaning your scouting probe should leave around 4:10 if you want to keep it alive.

_


In a normal 12 rax the first marine will pop out at 3:05.

If you scout with stalker/zealot pressure in PvT and when you get there he has 3 marines he's doing it off 1 rax meaning it shouldn't be an all in in the immediate future. 

_

If the zerg goes a 2:05 pool (standard) into a standard expansion he will plant down the natural expansion at around 2:40. If he is going to take a gasless third it will plant down as soon as 4:15 and possibly as late as 4:45. 

_

The standard timing on a 3 base roach warren is roughly 6:30 meaning you can poke until 7:30 against only lings and queens on 3 base. 

_

The fastest a widow mine drop can hit you is roughly 7:00 (might need to check the timings on that. It's not crisp but it's around there.) With an expansion this will hit around 7:30.

_

(*Edit: timing*) The fastest an in base reaper (not proxied) can hit you is roughly 4:15 minutes if it's a standard reaper.

_

An 8-8-8 Reaper will hit your base at roughly 3:20 depending on the map.

_


Stim will finish on a standard terran at about 9:00 so be ready for a timing attack at about 9:30-10 if he's planning one.

_

The standard time for a safe oracle build to hit your mineral line is 6:45. 

_

The standard time for DT's to hit your ramp is roughly 7:05.

I can't really think of anymore crucial timings that your opponent will do. Feel free to correct any of my time if they are vastly off. Please add more timings if I missed any. 

If someone could enlighten me on the time a 1rax CC would go down and when it'd hit the natural if it was build in base. Also when a standard lair timing is, i feel like its about 7:30 but i could be wrong. Also the marine count differences for a barracks with reactor compared to a 2rax and a 1 rax. And I can't think of anymore besides a mutalisk timing off 2 base which i believe is 12 minutes.

*Edit x2:* A standard 1 rax FE will have a CC down at 3:05. 3:20 if they get their 2nd depot before it. Meaning it will be done around 4:45 or 5 and if it's made in base will be down at the natural at 5:00 or 5:15.

What would you guys think of a semi-recurring thread where we all share what builds we are using or builds we think are really cool?  I know it sort've organically happens a bit already but I think it'd be cool to have build orders and discussion for up-to-date builds all in one place.

I feel like it'd be a good way to keep on top of the metagame, especially for those who don't have time to watch all of the relevant games being played.  Or if you're struggling with a certain matchup maybe you can come here and find a build that better suits your style.  Or if you just have a really badass timing you want to share, we can all see it.


I'll post the builds I'm using in the comments, so let me know if you think this is a good idea because I think it'd be a cool addition to the subreddit.

EDIT:  It looks like you guys think this is a good idea.  How often would you guys want to do this?  I was thinking either once a week or twice a week.  Once a week is of course more prompt when there's a new cool build to use, but I feel twice a week may spread things out enough that there's always something to talk about in the thread.

So, due to everyone freaking out about all this ""OMG TOO MANY BUILD REQUESTS"" threads, let's get together and ~~feel alright~~ harvest the information that Dreamhack gives at our feet. 

As a general format, follow below:  
**PvT: Huk's Warp Prism Rush**  
VOD: http://www.twitch.tv/nasltv/b/395830855?t=12h19m8s  

Intro: This game is from group stage 3, played on whirlwind, and uses some fun warp prism trickery to drop these dirty terrans before they can drop us.  

**Build Order**  
9 Pylon  
13 Gateway  
15 Assim x2  
16 Pylon  
18 Cyber Core  
23 Pylon  
100% Cyber core- WG research and Stalker - Happens at 23 supply  
27 Nexus - Goes down ~ 4:30  
27 MSC  
27 Robo (Probe production stopped here for a second)  
32 Pylon, 2 more Gateways  
37 Warp Prism  
40 - Proxy pylon outside of NME base - Goes down at 6:40   
49 - 2 More gateways (5 total)  

At this point, you're ready to go. A few stalkers poke up the ramp, which Polt reinforces. Meanwhile, your warp prism goes into the main, unloads 4 sentries and warps in zealots. All you need are a few good FF on the ramp to the natural, and the poor Polt has nothing to defend his main.  Keep the warp prism there and warp in as your gateways come off cooldown.  

The key is the prism placement. Needs to be far enough away from the ramp that marines can't kill it, but close enough so that the sentries can FF.  Huk hits at about 8:10, just as stim finishes, oddly enough, but before a medivac can be completed.  Should hopefully catch a terran working to drop play off guard.  

So this is my effort. Recommend edits if you'd like. And, more importantly, take some time to watch a game you thought was good and write the build down for ~~auir~~ everyone.",,False,self,t5_2tkqb,1367021976.0,,gold,True,t3_1d6rcs,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/1d6rcs/dreamhack_build_analysis_thread/,
1369812189.0,55,self.allthingsprotoss,1f98o5,my PvT build with a 80 - 90% win rate against GM's and Masters! Stolen from parting,iMp_Naerok,59,4,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/1f98o5/my_pvt_build_with_a_80_90_win_rate_against_gms/,"For anyone that has issues with PvT i have a solution.

Before hand ill give you things its weak against and things its strong against!

***Weak against:*** 

* CC first into a really early 7 barracks bio 
* Not specifically mech openers, but the early expand hide in your base mech style is really strong against it.
* Mass sky terran
* Any really early upgrade play (4:30 engie bay)
   
 ***If its scouted!!!*** : 

            * 4+ bunkers and depot wall
            * A really small ramp to nat with a depot wall

***Strong against:***

* Any gas openers into hellion, widow mine, hellbat (Which is the most common on ladder
* Proxy factory, starport
* Banshees
* Any really early marine drop play
* 1rax gasless expand into 3 rax bio
* 1rax reaper expand into bio
* 3cc
* 5-7 rax before starport
* Any other werid bio plays or openers. 

So as you can see this build is very strong, it defeats the most common builds you see in GM and Masters, However we see mech is becoming a bit more common so it can be weak against mech which is where most of your loses will come from.


Either way here is the build, and after that ill link you a replay that Parting used the build against flash as well as a bunch of mine.

&gt;9 pylon                       

&gt;13 gateway               

&gt;15 gas (Rally probe to gas patch to be as efficient as possible)

&gt;16 pylon (Make sure to place this in a area that gives you vision against reapers so you can react)

&gt;18 cybernetics core

&gt;21 pylon

&gt;21 mothership core OR stalker (preference and depends on map) (chrono)

&gt;23 - 24 Expand

&gt;2nd gas

&gt;@50 gas get warpgate

&gt;@50 gas get stalker if you did not already get one, if you did get a msc

&gt;@100 gas get sentry

&gt; 2 forges when sentry is started (try to hide this in a area not vulnerable by drops)

&gt; Get +1/+1

&gt; pylon in the back of your main mineral mine

&gt; pylon in front of your expo but close enough to cover the minerals

&gt; a cannon at each base by your mineral lines using these pylons

&gt; Get two more gateways

&gt; Get your naturals gas

&gt; Twilight council

&gt;@100% twilight council, Get charge and +2/+2

&gt;Add on 3 -4 more gateways

&gt;Add on templar archive

&gt;Add on 2-3 more gateways to have a total of 9

&gt;Send probe out unless you already have one and hide it to make a pylon

&gt;Make a proxy pylon

&gt;Move out at roughly 11 minutes once you have stalkers in main to cover for drops

&gt; With 3 archons and a bunch of zealots + 3 sentrys hit right when 2/2 finishes, use slow and forcefeilds to trap the bio

&gt; keep reinforcing with a heavy emphasize on archons whenever you get 300 gas. Sentrys can be good as well.

And there you have it, a very safe build that goes into a very powerful all-in


**Here are some side notes to keep in mind :**
&gt; Make sure you continue to produce sentrys after your +1/+1 starts until you have 3!

&gt; When one sentry has 100 energy create a hallucination phoenix to help scout out your opponent. if you see mech make a robo and take a early 3rd.

&gt; Your msc is there to save your butt, with the photon overcharge. You should have 3 gateways completed by the time the photon overcharge goes away if the terran does pressure. (This is normal, and its very easy to defend with 3 sentrys and zealots  + msc)

&gt; if widow mines are out of a cannons range just make more cannons, It will delay your push a bit but not by much, and they will benefit in helping from drops or base trades in the future.

&gt; Don't move out without at least 4 stalkers in your main to defend against drops.

&gt; Make sure he does not try to base trade you.

&gt; Do not engage up the main ramp until your confident you can and you have checked the third for a expo as well as killed the naturals expo

&gt; Your scouting probe only needs to see gas and then try to hide him where terran will not scout. This helps for proxy in the future.

&gt; If there is a depot wall and 2 or more bunkers, add a robo and go into archon stalker sentry. Keep pressuring and don't let your archons be killed.

Knowing and understanding these lists in combination with a bit of (hopefully now more informed) scouting will let you know exactly what timing you most have to worry about when in a game.

Note: I believe that I have written up all of the important ones, but it is completely possible that I have missed a few.  Please let me know if there are any big ones that you were expecting to find, but weren't there.  I'm trying to make this a more-or-less fully comprehensive list of all the major timings, but I can't do it without your help!

massive colossus army with stalkers and high templars backing it up, should be up againts either corrupters

they can't be dragged. 

Creator is very turtley, instead of defending, get 1-2 or 3 warp prisms to target down outlying bases, can use
Void rays with recall to snipe base and/or tech, especially against slow hydras.

Here is the [VOD](http://www.twitch.tv/jwu0169/b/358345505)

[Game 1](http://drop.sc/296515): 3:18:10: I'm only allowed to make one gateway unit (like 1 high templar, or 1 dark templar, no massing units) and the rest air units for the whole entire game.

[Game 2](http://drop.sc/296521): 3:26:35: CONGO LINE! I'm only allowed to build buildings as long as they touch another building. This means I cannot drop a nexus unless there is a building touching it.

[Game 3](http://drop.sc/296514): 3:38:30: I'm only allowed to make one type of gateway unit and one type of Robo unit.

[Game 4](http://drop.sc/296516): 3:48:40: I'm only allowed to make immortals and sentries, but cannot attack unless i use warp prisms to drop in his base. LOL at 3:58:55 and at 4:02:30.

[Game 5](http://drop.sc/296517): 4:05:10: I'm only allowed to build gateway units and a mothership, and can only attack by recalling in the opponents main base. RemarK made this challenge too hard and wouldn't let me make observers which ended up costing me the game. LOL at 4:19:00.

[Game 6](http://drop.sc/296519): 4:31:30: I didn't scout my base and got proxy 2gated :(

[Game 7](http://drop.sc/296520): 4:41:30: I must have a carrier before I'm allowed to make any robo/stargate/high tech units. But I'm still allowed to make zealot/sentry/stalker.

[Game 8](http://drop.sc/296522): 4:50:00: I'm only allowed to have a maximum of 3 of one type of unit.

[Game 9](http://drop.sc/296512): 5:06:00: I must name a United States president or sing a verse from a pop song sung by a female for each warpin of units. 

[Game 10](http://drop.sc/296513): 5:23:00: Everytime I research an upgrade, I must sacrifice two probes and type a sentence of my biography LOLOLOLOL.

EDIT: [Game 11](http://drop.sc/296510): 2:50:30: I'm only allowed to make zealots. Somehow I managed to hold a 1-1-1 with pure zealot/cannon.

1364643315.0,46,self.allthingsprotoss,1baqkm,Skytoss PvZ replay pack. Just hit master HoTS with 85% PvZ winrate,daren_james,57,11,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/1baqkm/skytoss_pvz_replay_pack_just_hit_master_hots_with/,"I've been debating for a while whether i should post some replays of my PvZ build. Some people in another thread were asking for pvz skytoss builds so here's mine. I've been doing it since WoL (where I was also master league) and haven't changed anything for HoTS.

In a nutshell, my build is: FFE into 2stargate void ray harass while taking a third and making cannons, then maxing on 3/3/3 carriers and expanding aggressively and making a LOT of cannons to defend. This build is effective up to mid-masters where the zergs start responding correctly (killing you early, repeatedly denying your third, and picking you apart with multi-pronged harass). It takes low mechanical skill to execute but requires some good decision making. It's not a good build if you want to be a good player (i'm definitely not a good player, my pvp and pvt are atrocious) but it's fun, it works, and people have asked me to share so i'm sharing.

So, here are links to replays of *every* HoTS pvz i've played since launch (minus a few where i tried some stupid twilight council build and lost horribly), along with descriptions/comments. I placed into gold after placements (i know i'm not the only masters player who that happened to lol) so i've put the replays in order; the level of play of the opponents goes up pretty consistently till the end. also it should be noted that some (most?) of the diamonds i played were master WoL (i checked accounts after games and saw this a few times). after that i'm going to talk about some of the concepts/thought processes behind the build.

EDIT: games against masters players (all wins) are marked

http://drop.sc/315861 bel shir vestige(2): standard win. killed 3rd with void pressure pressure. tried to pressure main, but hydras showed up so retreated (this is important, cant lose any of the first 4 voids!)

http://drop.sc/315863 neo planet s le: standard win. alllmost kill the third, maybe i should have finished it? but losing early voids is BAD.

http://drop.sc/315856 akilon wastes(4): strange sub-optimal zerg opener into poorly executed but somewhat dangerous 3-base hydra/queen pressure. i hold and max out for the win.

http://drop.sc/315864 newkirk precinct (4): killed lair with voidray pressure. zerg goes muta ling and gets multiple waves of lings into my base, but i am resilient. max out (slower than normal due to ling pressure) for the win.

http://drop.sc/315865 whirlwind le(2): first loss. this is a good game to study; its one of the main ways i lose with this build. i do MASSIVE damage with void ray pressure, but needed to go home earlier: opponent went heavy muta, catches my 4 voids, then more or less a-moves to my base for the win. i tend not to scout with this build (again, i'm not a very good player), but i should really put more effort into knowing if mutas are coming. all i needed to do was send the voids home after killing the hatch and i would have been able to defend the mutalisks.

MASTERS http://drop.sc/315866 whirlwind le(3): first game/win against master leaguer. runs first lings into my base but i defend relatively well. forces me to cancel my third with lings, and delays void rays moving out...but i hit with 6 instead of the usual 4 and kill a ton of overlords. from there its max out for the win. he applies some ineffective pressure throughout the max-out process. my unit positioning was important for denying pressure: equidistant from the cannon lines in natural and third. he does good damage in the first carrier v corruptor battle, so i wait to replenish lost carriers. being at max carriers is important. i microd kinda bad in one of the later carrier v corruptor engagements. i think i was trying out a new style (launch interceptors and run all carriers back). i think it works better to just a-move and select the ones in front and move them back. lastly: i kept pressure on in his base with the remnant of my carrier army while remaxing at home. if less carriers had survived i'd have sent them home instead.

http://drop.sc/315857 akilon wastes(12): second loss. i kill his 3rd with voids while he gets lings in my main. i do well enough against the lings but then he goes muta ling and i don't defend well enough. probably a bad decision to push out when i did...even if you're bleeding pretty bad its usually better to keep turtling until 3/3/3 200/200. i probably had a small chance to win if i had done that.

http://drop.sc/315858 akilon wastes(13): sloppy build execution...i push later with 5 voids due to supply block. i get aggressive (and do well) with void ray micro against hydras. opponent tries hydra pressure and leaves early when it's clear its not working and i'm way ahead.

http://drop.sc/315867 whirlwind le(4): sloppy defense vs 10 pool. opponent follows up with swarm hosts...bad idea(/luck?), he prob woulda won with fast hydras. i send voids to his base and get a good trade v mutas. he leaves early when it's clear he's behind.

MASTERS http://drop.sc/315859 akilon wastes(15): win vs master leaguer. standard opening. zerg tries to deny third with lings but i defend with voids. i kill his third (twice! he restarts it, and i kill it before he cancels). zerg then does hydra/ling pressure; i defend and he leaves early.

http://drop.sc/315860 akilon wastes(16): ahgl game vs weak (silver-ish?) zerg player. standard win. boring game.

http://drop.sc/315868 whirlwind le(7): standard win. no damage with void ray pressure. zerg forces cancel on fourth but i got it up eventually so its fine. zerg goes mutas; around 5-6 carriers i was confident i had the army advantage so i pushed out early to keep his mutas/attention on my push instead of killing probes in my base. it worked, but it was situational and dangerous. this build is about coinflips like this! from there its mostly just make carriers and win.

MASTERS http://drop.sc/315862 neo planet s le(6): my account hit masters with this win. the opponent is also master level; he got his promotion in the next game or two (i checked lol). pretty standard opening/voidray pressure/macroing up. one unusual thing: i counterattacked after one of his pushes. it worked out well for me. i tend not to counter attack because i like to wait for 3/3/3 200/200 to attack usually but in this game it seemed prudent to counterattack.

So, overall, a record of 11-2 (a win rate of 84.6%), and currently 3/0 against solid masters players (maybe a little different depending on if you count diamonds who were master WoL and haven't hit master HoTS yet). pretty good, especially for a player as shitty as me. hehe.

Now some important concepts:

--Taking a third: double stargate forces zerg to react or lose. this gives you time to take a third; its harder for zerg to deny it because they need to get spores/queens/hydras out. i typically take my third when my second pair of void rays is building. you're not totally safe but as you can see from my replays you can almost always get it up. Additionally: use your first two void rays to clear out lings/overlords for taking a third. you don't need to hide your void rays because the whole build revolves around your opponent seeing 'oh hes going stargate' and focusing on anti-air while you get a third up.

taking bases after the third: the build is gas intensive and you have a lot of minerals to spare. so it's actually worth it to just expand aggressively and unsafely (ie you know you're going to cancel if they pressure it). if you get stuck on 3 base you're in coin flip land--you won't be able to macro up another force of carriers after the initial engagement. getting a 4th (and 5th!) up does wonders for being able to remax. so be aggressive about getting it down!

max upgrades, max army: i can't explain why, but after doing this build hundreds of times i've definitely found that i lose far more often when i push out before 3/3/3 200/200. even when it makes sense to push out early, there's just something special about 3/3/3 200/200 carriers. so a lot of my games i end up sitting around on 200/200 doing basically nothing (maybe taking another expo or making more cannons) crono'ing my last upgrades.

idk what else to say. if i think of anything i'll put it in the comments. i'd love to hear feedback.",,False,self,t5_2tkqb,1364644050.0,,,True,t3_1baqkm,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/1baqkm/skytoss_pvz_replay_pack_just_hit_master_hots_with/,

It was way too long to put into this and I know it's a lot of information, but you can just search through it for stuff that you are having trouble with. I think it is pretty comprehensive so take a look!

Any feedback is appreciated (although I would prefer constructive criticism) and any additional questions you have just put in the comments section and I will add them to the guide.

I will add a more detailed build order (probably to about 45 to 50 food) and replays with different builds from the Terran and general analysis when I get to my desktop. I apologize I'm on my laptop right now so I don't have access to them and I wanted to get the guide up asap.

EDIT: Now with a little bit longer build order and replays!

If the guide is received well and you guys want me to do a different PvT build or PvZ guide I could probably do that as well! I have no idea what I do PvP so I don't really want to do that but I might be able to give tips or something...

This will be my first ""guide"" so to speak on HOTS :D I put guide in quotations because it won't really be a guide, but more my thoughts based on some examples I have about a strategy. This is mostly because a guide should be on something that is known to work a large percentage of the time in the same fashion with set guide lines and a build order. This is not that. This is me expressing my ideas and my experiences with those ideas so far.

I might find myself doing a few more of these throughout the early stages of HOTS and once solid meta's start to form.

So for this first ""Thoughts On"" post it's going to be about SkyToss in PvZ!

As of right now SkyToss in PvZ is my go to strategy and I have been doing extremely well with it. My PvZ winrate in HOTS is currently at 70% this season (found in the statistics tab in the new UI) and I have been using some form of SkyToss for about 90% of the games I'd say.

For me SkyToss consists of:

Core Units

* Phoenix
* Void Ray

Support Units

* Tempest/Carrier

Tanking Units

* Zealot
* Archon

I've been basing my SkyToss strategy around a Phoenix/Void Ray/Zealot mix. While playing SkyToss you end up with a lot of excess minerals so that's where all the zealot dumps come in. The zealots are really good tanking units since they're cheap and relatively beefy and take shots away from the important air units. Then the Tempests or Carriers come in depending on what I see the zerg is making late game as support. Tempests for dealing with very turtle like zergs going brood lords and carriers for the other things really. I will also add archons in if I see that my spending is a little out of whack and I have a large bank of gas at some point. They're mostly situational and I don't make them every game.

So onto the analysis.

[Game 1](http://drop.sc/304021)

You see that the title of this post is ""AKA Why Phoenix's are awesome"" and I'll be emphasizing that point with these first two replays. The second two aren't as heavily focused on the Phoenix's.

So this game is a very basic overview and introductory like game show casing my style of SkyToss. I open with some light pressure that simply sets up a 3rd base and then I go into 2-3 stargate production with 3 bases.

**THE OPENING BUILD IS NOT IMPORTANT**

You can open whatever you'd like really. That part doesn't matter. As long as you get to this nice convergence point safely then you're good to go. 

So I get void rays out of my stargates first because they pack a big punch and do not require energy to do their damage. You need to get a good base of voids up first before you can go crazy with phoenix and other things so that way you don't simply die to a large roach or roach/hydra push to the front before you can really get going.

Now after I have a good void count up then I can start with the Phoenix. This is my answer to the inevitable ""But what about Hydras?"" question.

Just watch the replay and be amazed. Let me give you a few statistics before I go a little more into this. 

Phoenix's do 5 damage and 10 vs Light. They attack twice. Meaning they do 10 damage and 20 vs Light. Hydra's, if you were unaware, are light units. Hydra's have 80 health. A little bit of 4th grade math and we have the outcome of a Hydra dying to 5 Phoenix shots (with 1 HP regen). 5 shots. That is not a lot of shots, especially since Phoenix are easily massed and shoot quite quickly.

As we see in this game Phoenix's are quite key in taking out the very deadly, but weak, Hydra's so that our heavy void rays (And eventual Tempests/Carriers) can clean up the rest.

It's even more evident in the second push.

[Game 2](http://drop.sc/304020) (I know the title says 3, just go with it.)

So this is where we see what happens when we DON'T have Phoenix's in our army. This game after a successful Oracle harass opening I still get to the same convergence point of 2-3 stargates getting void rays out and a 3rd base. Except this game, I don't go for a large amount of Phoenix. Why? Because I simply wanted to see what would happen.

So before I make my point I want to note at how bad units that cannot shoot up are at dealing with air units.

As we watch the first push into the zergs base my army gets shit on quite easily. He's still maxed while I dip down to 160. There are still a lot of Hydras left on the ground. This is because I didn't have a phoenix army to support the void rays and tempests by taking down the Hydra threat like what happened in game 1.

Now fast forward a bit and I realize this no Phoenix thing isn't going to work very well. I get a good mix back with a good amount of phoenix's and the next major battle all of a sudden looks much more like the one in the first game.

[Game 3](http://drop.sc/304019) (Again, wrong title, sorry.)

So this game opens basically the same as game 2. A successful (very successful) Oracle opening leads to the convergence point of 2-3 stargates and void rays coming out with a 3rd base. 

This game mostly just solidifies the main point again and shows how good void rays are at killing corruptors and how you shouldn't attacking into a full anti-air army that has a bunch of spores underneath it.

[Game 4](http://drop.sc/304022)

This final game is an added utility of the Phoenix. Some other ideas that have come out to deal with this SkyToss style is to get Vipers and use their grappling hook ability (I can't recall the name of it right now TT) to pull the important units in to be sniped. Phoenix are quite good at dispatching of Vipers before or after a battle takes place. Even though they are armored and won't take the extra damage from the Phoenix they still fall to Phoenix's nicely.

You can mostly chase them down after a fight very easily or poke forward with them before a fight to try and snipe them beforehand.

This game also just solidifies the idea of SkyToss = good and Carriers being super sexy as well.


Well that's it for this first post of my thoughts on how HOTS is going at the moment! I hope this sparks some good discussion and maybe inspires some of you to play more SkyToss in PvZ! I'll do another one of these on one of the other match ups as soon as I can get a style that is seemingly at least stable. PvP is a cluster fuck at the moment and PvT is basically the same as before and there's also some weird shit with the Hellbats so we'll wait to see what happens with them soon. I'll most likely be doing a PvT Oracle opening one of these as the next one though.

Thanks for reading!

We would like to compile a list for the sidebar of relevant [Day9 Dailies](http://day9.tv/d/b/day9tv-dailies/ ""Be a Better Zealot."").

Please list here, in no particular order, which dailies you think are the most helpful, the most insightful, and the most relevant for getting better at playing Protoss.  

Please list at least 3 or 4, but no more than 12, and try to stay relatively recent.  I am going to say nothing before episode 400, unless you can justify its relevance.

Generally, we will try to keep the list current to the top Protoss dailies from most recent hundred episodes or so.

No explanations are necessary - you can just list the episode numbers.  If you'd like to provide a **BRIEF** reason why you think that particular episode is awesome, feel free.

Please upvote for exposure.  List will be added to the sidebar once we feel there has been sufficient input, and the mods pare the list down to the top uhhh ... we don't know how many yet.  Let's say 10?  10 is nice.  Yay 10!

For each of these tests I focus fired each side and assume no upgrades.  Questions are at the top, answer is at the bottom, some are easy, so try to guess the outcome, for example how many of the winning side survive and what %hull/shield is left:

1.  What wins? 3 stakers or 1 immortal?
2. 1 Void vs 2 stalkers
3. 1 pre-charged void vs 3 stalkers
4. 1 stalker vs 1 muta
5. 5 stalker vs 6 muta
6. 2 stalker vs 1 broodlord
7. 2 stalker, 1 colossus vs 1 broodlord
8.  How many attacks from a colossus does it take to kill a broodling
9. 7 stalker, 1 colossus vs 4 broodlords (blink used once at the beginning so the broodling wall didn't trap stalkers.)
10. 1 stalker vs 2 marines
11. 1 stalker vs 3 marines
12. DT vs zelot,obs
13. 2 DT vs 3 zelot, obs
14. 2 DT vs 3 stalker, obs
15. 1 phoenix vs 2 mutas
16. 4 phoenix vs 8 mutas

*1.  Immortal barely wins with a little hull left

*2.  Stalkers barely win with 1 left with little hull left

*3. Stalkers win handily, only losing 1

*4. Stalker wins with light damage to hull

*5. ~~Stalkers barely win with one left~~ Too close to call, could go either way depending on who gets the first shot off, how much overshots the stalkers waste, whether the mutas focus fire stalkers weakened by glaive bounces.

*6. Brood Lord just barely wins

*7. Stalkers win only losing 1

*8. A little bit of a trick question. Colossos does 2x15 damage each attack and broodlings are 30 hp, however sometimes it takes 2 attacks because of that 1 hp regenerating in between the 2x attack.

*9.  Pretty much a tie here (the colossos survives, but its only there to cut down on the damage of the broodlings)

*10.  Stalker wins with 1/2 hull gone

*11. Marines wreck losing only 1 marines, 1/2 health on another

*12. DT wins with only shield gone

*13. zelots win 1 survives w/ full health a second has very little hull left

*14. DT wins with 1 left w/ most it's hull

*15. Phoenix wins with 1/3 it's hull left

*16. Mutas stomp with 3 left over

Edit:  Too many due to formatting :(

Edit 2: Turns out questions 5 is too close to call and has a number of small factors that can change the outcome, I'm changing the answer to really close.

You can track all of our progress with this convenient link: www.gosubuilds.com/new-hots-builds/, or just go to [the website itself](http://www.gosubuilds.com/) and click around to see what's what.

So far, in terms of Protoss builds, we've completed a new PvP build and PvZ opener (seriously, who DOESN'T love the mothership core??).  One by SaSe, one by Grubby.  Again, much more is on the way (the goal is to get at least 2 builds for each matchup by the end of the week - but 18 builds is a lot so we'll see o_0).

If you notice anything incorrect, please let me know either on the site in the comments or right here.  Feedback is the best thing you guys have to offer (huehuehue), so please let me know about this stuff!  Lastly, if any of you see a particularly SICK build with HotS units come out of any pro, and it doesn't look like we've written anything related to it up on the site, link me to the VOD/replay.  **And if you can come up with at least two VODs/replays of a pro doing the same build, I will literally drop everything and get you a fully written up build in like less than one day.  That's a guarantee!**

Here's where I could theoretically link you to our Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, etc, but instead here's a helpful micro nugget that maybe not all of you know of:

In PvZ, when you move out and then your zerg opponent ends up running around you, attempting to base trade, DO IT.

So now I find myself rushing for as fast as a prism as I can, my extra gates might not even be done lol.

The warp prism gives me just as much scouting as voidrays and phoenix do, but it requires no gas. When I first started using it, I had no intention of dropping, it was just a good scout, but when zergs see it, it's like they shit their pants. Then I found out I can pin queens to hatcheries with a two or three zealots.

Starting to use sentries instead of zealots now, and it's a bit tougher to do, but I'm pretty sure the high master and grandmaster players will begin moving their queens away from the hatch so the zealots won't do as much. 

The prism also allows me to take my 3rd early and safely because I can have 11 zealots in their base if they decide to move out.

Here are 2 replays that went as planned:

[Newkirk](http://drop.sc/316783)

[Whirlwind](http://drop.sc/316782)

In the above 2 the Terran expands early and I stay on 1 base, going for a quick Stargate, 2 Oracles, MSC and a total of 4 gates. I try to harass their mineral lines with the Oracles at the same time that I pressure the front with my MSC and ground army. 

[Korhal City](http://drop.sc/316785)

In the above replay the Terran also stays on 1 base early and comes at me with an early Marine/Marauder attack and does a decent amount of damage. I'm able to stabilize, drop my natural expand and push out with a MSC, gateway army and 4-5 Oracles. 

Overall I've got a [75%](http://imgur.com/evGI85D) win rate vs Terran. Mostly using this build. If you're struggling with PvT in platinum or lower, give this a try. (Also seems to work well in PvP. And you can proxy the Stargate for even quicker Oracle harass.)

Basic build order is:

9 Pylon, scout

13 Gateway

14 Assimilator

16 Pylon

17 Cyber Core

18 Assimilator

20 Pylon

23 Stargate

After that, MSC, add on 3 more gates, 2 Oracles, mix of Stalkers, Zealots, etc, proxy pylon, harass with Oracles as best you can and push up the front with your main army. It's a fairly simple build that works best if your opponent has taken an early expand.

At the moment, there are three hotkey layouts that are considered ""good"" beyond the default Standard and Grid, and these are: TheCore, FleetKeys, and DarkGrid.

I have been a champion of DarkGrid since I first started using it quite a long time ago. **It has a lot going for it:**

* Extremely ergonomic.
* Easy access to all ten control groups - you'll be wishing you had more.
* Easy access to all eight camera hotkeys.
* Abilities are generally uniform among units (eg - F is Forcefield, F is Blink, F is Photon Overcharge).

While I have looked at both TheCore and FleetKeys, I have issues with both of them. TheCore requires the user to remove keys from the keyboard and FleetKeys does not seem to be as ergonomic as DarkGrid.

I have updated DarkGrid to HotS, since its original creator left it to help JaKaTaK work on TheCore. I have also developed DarkGrid Trainer++.

[**Screenshot**](http://i.imgur.com/4UxrQJT.png)

Here are some features of this trainer:

* No need to memorize a graphic of the hotkeys. The application teaches you all of them.
* Interactive images for several of the training levels to help memory retention.
* Learning and Training Modes, which can be selected depending on your experience level. Work on learning one of the five hotkey lessons, or burn through a session of 50 questions in training mode.

What I'm looking for here is ***constructive*** feedback and feature requests before I post this thing onto r/starcraft. *This is an alpha build*, it's ***not*** done. Here are few more things that will be in the final version:

* Personal profile that keeps track of which questions you miss the most. A training level that revolves around asking you only these most-missed questions.
* More images beyond level 2 and level 3 content.
* Support for more hotkey layouts via .sc2hotkeys files.
* Support for all three races.

This will also be open-source when the final build comes out.  Thanks for your help.

1358609483.0,25,self.allthingsprotoss,16vm8g,Shield upgrade discussion,op_is_sea_gm_fyi,32,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/16vm8g/shield_upgrade_discussion/,"So basically, after the Daisy vs Nerchio game. I begain to think of how much I feel P players in general do not properly use shield upgrades just because they don't consider it and just get it once they are 3-3 on armour. I think this is a mistake in some situations for a number of reasons:

__vs Terran bio__:

Versus Terran bio I almost always go __1-1-0 -&gt; 2-2-0 -&gt; 2-3-1 -&gt; 3-3-2 -&gt; 3-3-3__ When running double forge. It seems really arbitrary but there is actually some thought behind it.

- The first reason is simple, 2-3-1 gateway units perform better against T bio than 3-3-0 gateway units. I haven't actually tested this with colossi in play since I don't play this style but if you go for the chargelot/sentry/stalker/templar army where a very large portion of your dps comes from storm as well as this style forcing more marines and less marauders, investing into an extra layer of armour is simply better than letting zealots and stalkers do more dps. I tested this in unit tester and it's really a lot better.

- Secondly, level 1 shield upgrades are cheaper than level 3 attack upgrades.

- Thirdly and less transparent, level 1 shield _finishes_ more quickly than level 3 attack, this is really important, the sooner you actually get benefit from your investment the better of course. There is about 90 seconds time where you don't have your attack yet where you could have extra shields.

- Fourthly and most opaguely, it maximises forge parallelism. You have two forges, if you first maximize attack and armour and only then run shields you are for the duration of the shield upgrading only running one forge instead of two at the same time. Meaning that for half of the time you spend on getting to 3-3-3 you only run one forge. If you use the upgrade scheme I outlined above you spend a longer time running both forges in parallel, meaning that you arrive at 3-3-3 a whole 220 seconds sooner.

- Fifthly, it does protect buildings, ever had a nexus just barely die to a drop? Well, that nexus would have lived with 50 hp left if it had +1 shields.

- This is personal for me, but I tend to go quite heavy on phoenix play in PvT sometimes and if you got 12 of them, they do benefit from shields.

- I know that emp negates shield upgrades entirely, but if you get your entire army emp'd you've lost anyway as a rule and most Terrans aim to emp the templar, not the army, for good reason.

:__vs Terarn mech__:

I essentially feel that any form of armour is completely useless versus mech and not worth the cost, you often see Zergs upgrade ranged + carapace vs mech, never got why. Just do only ranged or range+melee (what I do). Armour means almost nothing against mech, it's really only important versus marines, zealots, mutas and Zerglings or other rapid fire units with a low damage attack. Vs mech I like to get 1 forge and 1 core and go air attack and ground attack because air units definitely have a place against mech and the mech player against protoss does want armour because zealots, voids and carriers are some of the biggest enemies of mech, you don't want to fight + 3 armour thors with unupgraded carriers. Armour is also very important versus void rays.

While it would be intuitive to get shields against mech because you tend to get some air units with it, armour-like bonusses just don't really help a lot versus mech.

__vs Mutas__:

I tend to go just flat out double forge shield/armour against mutas. I don't think there is ever a reason to get attack instead of shield against muta play:

- You may think you want to harm mutas with stalkers but let's be honest, Zergs don't stand around to fight your stalkers; if they do shields are better anyway. Stalkers are a deterrent until you get storm out which is actually a damage dealer versus mutas, storm doesn't benefit from upgrades.

- Muta play typically involves mutas and zerglings, both of which are very sensitive against high armour values.

- Shields benefit buildings, mutas do find themselves hunting down tech and pylons quite a lot, having shield upgrades on them greatly reduces the effectiveness of mutas to do this, it does matter.

- If you go phoenix against mutas, they of course benefit from shield values as well versus the muta glaive.

__vs Protoss__:

I really don't see a good reason to get shields or even armour against protoss, while I do tend to run double forge in PvP I'm not sure if it's worth it at all. The highest rapid fire unit protoss has is the zealot which still isn't nearly as extreme as the Zergling or the marine and zealots in general in PvP don't find themselves dealing that much damage due to forcefields but mostly baiting out colossus fire.",,False,self,t5_2tkqb,1358670458.0,,master,True,t3_16vm8g,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/16vm8g/shield_upgrade_discussion/,

I work 20-25 a week to pay for rent/food/bills but otherwise primarily focus on SC2. For the past couple months I've also hired a guy to come over 4-5 days a week and help me out with analyzing all of my sc2gears game data.

The friends I currently rent an apartment with are not very big into SC2. This doesn't negatively effect my practice but I think it would be very helpful if I had roommates who were as dedicated and interested in SC2 as I am.  I would like to set up a pseudo team house/apartment  somewhere in the US with people that have a living situation similar to mine.

It wouldn't really cost anything aside from moving expenses.  Everyone would continue working low level wage jobs to pay the bills. It would be a normal ""renting an apartment with friends"" situation. In this case though everyone would happen to be an aspiring SC2 professional.

Any thoughts or interest in the idea?

I've always been a fan of void rays in PvZ, but they just didn't really work in the lategame. The reasons? Too little DPS without a pre-chargeup, too few hitpoints, too slow, massacred by chain fungals and infested terrans.

This new change seems to be a huge step forward. Honestly, just looking at the numbers, the unit should be much stronger from now on. Not just because it's initial DPS got buffed, but also because of fungal &amp; infested terran nerfs.
  
Here are the numbers:  
VR DPS against non-armored before the patch: 10(13.3 when charged)  
VR DPS against non-armored after the patch: 12(12 when using ability)  
VR DPS against armored before the patch: 16.7(26.6 when charged)  
VR DPS against armored after patch: 20(32 when using ability)  
  
At first glance it might seem like a minor buff to it's DPS. However, the buff is actually huge if you consider when the damage is dealt. Before the patch, VRs started out with their measly low-dmg non-charged state. This was always a problem, because fights have the tendency to snowball out of control. Whichever side takes a lead in the fight during the initial 1-2 seconds of it usually crushes the other side in the battle. This is what's best about letting people manually activate the charge - you can start the battle with almost double the DPS to armored targets compared to the old Void Ray.

It will mean that Void Rays are going to be very cost-efficient against corruptors and basically everything armored(maybe with the exception of the thor).

Void Rays lost their bonus to massive, but honestly, they are probably still gonna do more damage to them thanks to the DPS buff. And anyway - the problem never was about VRs not being able to kill BLords - it was them not being able to go up against infestor-corruptor which were protecting the brood lords.

I for one am very excited to try out stargate strats including mass void-ray with appropriate support. At my level(diamond), voids worked even in WoL, so yeah...seems like exciting times are ahead(totally gonna try out VRay Colossus like in WoL beta)

It'll be high quality and indepth analysis covering a lot of different points, I'll pause, rewind.

Couple of terms: Bronze-gold, replays have to be under 15 minutes. Plat-master 20 minutes. I'm not willing to go much longer because I can talk a while and if you have a problem early game, I don't see the point in covering the late game among other reasons.


Try to send replays that you feel were good games or there was something about them. I'll be able to give feedback on what I see so if its a 4gate, I'm gonna talk about 4gates etc. When you send a replay, say what league you are and what you what help with. Like if you do 3gate pressure PvT and you want help with doing the pressure bit while expanding. Just stuff like that.

I hope I did this correctly, I wanted it to be a self.post without karma.

Anyway, I've caught the HotS tournament fever, and I really want to personally sponsor an online event for Platinum/Diamond players to have a piece of the action too. 

* Entry is free.

* Placement is first-come, first-served. 

* Comment or PM me ASAP with any interest to ensure your place in the competition. Please include your tag, rank, ladder data (W/L record, total points) and preferred race.

* Minimum = 16 players, Max = 32.

* Minimum = Platinum rank, Max = Diamond.

* There will be group play similar to GSL formatting- 4 groups for 16 players, 8 groups for 32 players.

* Seeding will be determined by rank and ladder points.

* Scheduling will be determined on a group-by-group basis, thus the magnitude needs to be smaller. Matches will most-likely take place on weekends or weeknights, depending on the time zones of players.

* 1st place will take home 50$, and 2nd place will take home 20$ (via PayPal).


I am assuming full responsibility for correspondence and scheduling, so please leave a comment or PM me if you are interested. 

Please keep in mind that I work full-time, and am organizing/sponsoring this out of pocket.


I will x-post to /r/AllThingsTerran and /r/allthingszerg.

Thanks everyone. Hoping for a big turnout from all 3 subreddits

It's now been 1 month since Heart of the Swarm was released, and I hope you all agree with me when I say: ""Wow - what a great month it's been.""  So I decided to just do a month re-cap of everything that's happened at GosuBuilds.

We uploaded a grand-total of 21 builds in just over 30 days.  All of them can be viewed [here](http://www.gosubuilds.com/new-hots-builds/).  We had a guest submitter, Slur, write up [Polt's 2rax Reaper FE](http://www.gosubuilds.com/hots-terran/hots-tvt/tvt-2rax-reaper-fe/), and another guest submitter, Modest, write up [MKP's 1/1/1 all-in](http://www.gosubuilds.com/hots-terran/hots-tvt/tvt-mkps-111-all-in/).  Unfortunately, no Protoss or Zerg guest submitters have stepped up to the plate, but I've definitely talked to some guys out there (you all know who you are) and I couldn't have done some of the builds without you.  Thanks for that :D

Now let's look at what we're looking to do going forward.  

* More builds!
* More builds!
* Get some pro replays of more builds!

The problem I'm having, simply put, is that I can't find any new HotS builds out there that seem standard enough to post about.  This is why I'm looking for your guys' help on this matter.  **If any of you get your hands on some pro (basically Code A or Code S) replays/VODs of standard builds that are or are not already uploaded to GosuBuilds, please let me know - I'd be super appreciative of it.**  

Here are some builds that I know exist, but haven't seen a pro execute repetitively, so have been unable to write-up a good build for:

* gasless 1rax FE vs Protoss that's actually safe vs oracles
* normal 1gate FE vs Terran that isn't ridiculously weak to either reaper opener or widow mine drop
* any standard ZvT build at all
* voidray all-in in PvT
* FFE into stargate in PvZ
* phoenix build in PvP
* gasless 1rax FE into 2 base hellbat drop vs Zerg

If there are others here that I failed to mention, let me know in the comments.  Again, thanks so much for everything this month has brought us!

Example charts, from [a 4v4 I played in](http://ggtracker.com/matches/2703400): http://i.imgur.com/Abv11aR.png

The x-axis is game time.  Each row is a Nexus.  The circles are chronoboosts.  The filled-in rectangles are times where your Nexus was at max energy, which of course is bad.

The chart will help you see exactly when you forgot to macro your Nexuses (and you can click-and-drag on the chart to see the exact time).  Should be helpful for finding the ""leaks"" in your game, to use Day[9]'s term.

Also, you get a ""Race Macro"" score for each game, based on your energy maxouts.  If your Nexuses were on max energy half the time, that's 50%.  If you have no energy maxouts at all that's 100%.  On your Player Profile page you can see the score for each game, so you can see your overall performance at a glance.

Hello guys and gals,

I've been quite busy with building up this site in the past 4 days and I'm quite happy with the amount of content I have on it to start promoting it.  My site is generally for Protoss players as I am a Protoss player myself.  I have replay packs, videos, builds, etc that will most likely help you improve your gameplay.  If you don't know, I've been making Youtube videos for Protoss players since WoL.  I'm trying to contribute to the community as much as I can.  For now I've started 2 amazing series; one is The HotS Seat and the other is Starting From Scratch.

**[The HotS Seat](http://flatlinesc2.com/category/video/the-hots-seat/)**

This series is where I breakdown a set of replays of a Protoss Pro and figure out his/her builds, decision making, and tendencies.  I've already done 3 episodes (EGiNcontroL, State, and Squirtle).  This series is for all leagues.

[**Starting From Scratch**](http://flatlinesc2.com/category/video/starting-from-scratch/)

This series is where I make my journey from Bronze to Master on the American Server.  I try to commentate majority of the time but I am human so please excuse some moments where I'm quiet.  But in this series, I'm really happy on what I'm giving because a lot of the lower leagues have the wrong mindset.  In this series, I give my thoughts and opinions on what your mindset should be in each league.  I've done 4 days/episodes for this series so far and I'm currently in Diamond only facing Master league players.  This series is coming to an end soon so please stay tune in and watch the finale.

I have a lot of ideas that I am aiming to add to my site.  For example, I am going to be making Discussion posts like I did where I show the Pros and Cons when it comes to [Forge FE vs. Gateway FE in PvZ](http://flatlinesc2.com/2013/07/blog/discussion-forge-fe-vs-gateway-fe-in-pvz/).  Remember that's just one of the ideas I have; there are many more to come :).

Please take some time out of your day and check out my site.  I do greatly appreciate feedback on what I can improve upon.

so my question to you, what is your favorite all-in? cheese is an acceptable answer. i'd prefer if you can make it race-specific, preferrably if you can include a build for each of the 3 matchups. 

if it's a little obscure, feel free to add in details of how to do it. build orders, basic micro strategies, when to cut workers, what to scout for when deciding to do this all-in, what to look out for, when to abandon the strategy, possible transitions afterwards, etc.

So I saw a wonderful post about PvZ, which I found extremely useful and thought that I can probably contribute a little bit as well. Now my PvZ is nowhere near as good, however I found that my PvP is pretty darn awesome.  At least at Diamond level.

Right now I am 1st place in my diamond division and hopefully I will progress to masters at some point. So if you are diamond and up, this build will probably be only mildly interesting, but for everyone else this could be a nice way to end PvP struggles. 

So first of all [this is my percentage](http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/7630/winei.jpg) in PvP. Right now it’s a 71% and most of the losses were from cheese, which I don’t really deal very well with. Also I lost due to unscouted pylons in my base and couple of times I lost to DTs, which this build is surprisingly good at. I was just being stupid. 

1. Overall build is to go 3 stalker rush to be safe against 4 gate and other plays like that into fast stargate into phoenix. Between first and second phoenix build a robo to produce immortals. Harass with phoenix to force stalkers and then finish him off with mostly zealot + 1-2 immortal army.

2. Important to save your stalkers, since they are the only stalkers you’ll be able to afford. Your gas will be spent on phoenixes and immortals. Minerals are for zealots, which will be dealing most of the damage. 
3. Once you encounter your final engagement, don’t try to kill anything with phoenixes. Phoenixes are there to lift units and disable them. So if you have 4-5 units, that’s 5 units which are not in his army anymore.
4. If you can – kill sentries while harassing. They are what can get you killed. If your zealots are trapped n FFs – you will absolutely lose. Therefore #1 priority for lifting = sentries. Funny enough, you don’t care about immortals. You have next to no stalkers and zealots are good vs immortals, so #2 priority for lifting are zealots.

5. Replays: 
http://drop.sc/316574 So here is the most common way the game progresses. I go 3 stalker rush for scouting, lost a stalker to see what’s going on in his main and then went back.  By the time you go back, you should be able to warp in 4 zealots just in case he wants to push and phoenixes are already done to harass. I made some scouting with phoenix, force him to overreact with stalkers and finish him off with an all-in build. The one thing that could have gone better is I could have gone some more immortals. Usually having two is somewhat desirable. 

http://drop.sc/316578 This build absolutely destroyed robo-openings for obvious reasons. Just make sure you don’t get trapped in force fields. Therefore you first targets should be sentries and then zealots. Once your zealots are free to do damage, there is nothing to stop you.

http://drop.sc/316587 Here is an interesting game. The guy went for oracle and got shut down completely. However he proceeded to go with void rays and defended really well. But I went wave after wave after wave of units and eventually overpowered him. Important to note, that once his nexus is established, there is nothing for you to do but to do an all-in. You are way far behind to start your own. This build does not need to be an all-in, but once you start producing units at full cycles – it becomes an all-in. You either win or die trying. 

http://drop.sc/316571 Here the guy went for fast oracle, but didn’t make any units to defend his main. So my stalkers did a lot of damage and then I later finished him off with my full army. Again, this build is awesome against oracles, since phoenix are so much faster.

http://drop.sc/316576 Here the build had to be adjusted because he went for voidrays + stalkers. So I had to have some more anti-air, not just phoenix. He went for early zealot/mothership_core/stalker harass, but my 3 stalkers killed his army and did some good damage at the other end.  Immortal wasn’t even needed at the end. 

http://drop.sc/316568 So here is the how I lose: A very strong delayed 4 gate pushed. Could have been defended, if I scouted it and choronoboosted an immortal. Or at least had my mothership core ready defend. Unfortunately, I thought I was safe and lost the game 

6. You would think that this build is bad against blink. This build completely annihilates blink play. You just need to wait for immortals to come out . Once they are out, and it should be in time for offensive blink play, you just defend until you can kill the observer. Once it’s dead proceed to kill him with zealots and immortals. Lift as many stalkers as you can to avoid his blinking. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any blink plays, but I assure you this build is potent against it. 
7. The absolute anti-build against is archon play. The only thing to do is to block your ramp with building and build cannons. Also pray he is stupid enough to attack you. If he chooses to expand, it is pretty much a GG.

On top of that I'm usually a base ahead of the terran, but low and behold they get one drop off after like five completely failed drops (losing the ships and tons of units in the process) at a sweet spot in my main on a map like daybreak and run forth and either kill a ton of the buildings in my main or kill a large portion of my forces left behind at my fourth only to climb back into the game because of that one drop even though they've been failing miserably the entire game beforehand. Maybe this is just me venting, but I feel like speed on dropships is a terrible terrible idea given that it only takes one to completely screw toss over in PvT and drops are already hard enough to defend.

Edit: Also I pose another question as part of my venting.  What in the hell is going on with the ladder? Nobody seems to be in the right league.

Introducing myself, I'm Dune(#784), a platinum protoss on EU.
I've been working alone during two days to find a damn safe way to expand in PvP. I've retried countless of times, went outside running to think about it again, and again, trying to mix in a few other builds (this [2gate expand build from Sase (TL)](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=339898) really inspired me), to get to something really stacked, bulletproof against the various 1base allins.

I've come to the point where more understanding of the game or the matchup (remember, I'm plat) would be the only way I could improve the build further.

So I'm here to both share with you guys and to look forward your feedback, to what looks aberrant to you (I've already had some feedbacks from players I've played against that helped me a lot), to what kind of allin it would be freelose against in your opinion. Thanks!


**The replay**
This is the replay of the final build perfectly executed on ohana, with no opponents (theres a very easy AI for poking):
[Demo replay](http://www.mediafire.com/?xayn9rkqnk763q3)

I'm not giving more replays yet, I doubt winning a plat ladder game with that would be much relevant to proof this is safe vs X allin, plus my execution is never perfect.


**The build order**
*Note: I'm using Ĉ to abbreviate chronoboost, by default on nexus*

    9 - Pylon
    Ĉ x 2
    13 - Gateway
    scout proxy positions on main and natural then send to scout
    14 - Gas
    15 - Pylon
    Ĉ
    send two probes to gas
    18 - Cyber
    19 - Gate (2)
    20 - Gas (2)
    two probes on this one too
    21 - WG (Ĉ I)
           Stalker
    Minicut probes for pylon
    23 ASAP - Pylon

    Ĉ WG (II) 
    Stalker (2)
    Stalker (3)
    Ĉ stalker from first gate (so it catches up)

    30 - Cut probes and send probe to natural
           Nexus
           Pylon
    Add a probe to each gas for a total of 3
    Resume probes*
     Sentry x2 - one will be slightly supply blocked
    Ĉ the late sentry
    
    6'10 - Two sentries pop, WG finishes;
             Morph gateways, add a Robo and a Gate (3)
             Warp zealot+sentry
             Very short 42/42 supply block before nexus finishes


**Commentaries**

The critical parts of the builds are:

* Scouting inbase and natural proxy positions, or be very confident in holding a 2gate proxy with a worst case scenario.
* Get the second gate asap and as close as possible to the choke - move a probe immediatly after you queued the 19th probe.
* The 23 Pylon can VERY easily supply blocks you and screw up everything, anticipate it.
* Only add missing probes to the gas after you've built the Nexus-Pylon, you need these asap.
* Finally, it is important to get the Robo as soon as you can, for an observer (immortal if you've identified what's coming with your stalkers).


As soon as your 2d and 3d stalker pop (at the same time), move out with the 3 stalkers to attack the base of the ennemy. Bait a forcefield at their ramp in case they have a sentry with zealots, then move up. These stalkers can sometimes do a surprising amount of damage, but do not overextend, do not sacrifice them for a few probes. 3 stalkers do NOT one shot probes (you need 4), and you want to cost efficiently trade army or to back.

The important thing with these 3 stalkers is to 1) optionally panic your opponent 2) get a good idea of what he's doing. Either you can walk up ramp and directly look at the buildings (best case scenario), either I suppose you'll have to interpret how much gas he's spending in his army and compare it with the amount of gas you've scouted with your first probe. I'm still bad at reading this though.


**Safety vs allins**

*Feel free to correct me for anything I say in here. I may be wrong at any moment.*


**4gate:** The two 6'10 sentries (plus the two units of your choice immediatly after, since you're morphing to warpgate) should be enough to hold every standard 4gate, giving up the expansion and adding more gates. You've already saturated your main at this point, and you can easily wait for an additional two sentry warpin to deny the access to your main.

*Edit*: it may be necessary to chrono sentries against 10gate 4gates, but that shouldn't be too much of a problem since you should have map control at that point.

**3gate robo** You'll soon have a 3gate robo of your own with much more eco, and should be able to defend the natural with good forcefields and chronoboosts on the robotics. I've found this to be the easiest to hold.

**DT rush** I've recently experienced that, I did a lot of damage with my initial stalkers. Try forcefielding the ramp to gain time, chronoboost the obs, your robo should be in time unless you messed up.

**Blink allin** This is the reason why I still hesitate to do this on cloud kingdom (antiga is banned from the map pool here, and the build is obviously not viable on taldarim). I've held some blink allins and lost to some others. I think this build doesn't set you behind on most of the maps, the robo should finish at 7'10. (Or am I wrong?)

**1base colossus** According to bmanCO, this kind of allin may be held by chronoboosting immortals, forcefielding the army out and focusing the colossus when it comes close. Will have to try!

**Zealot archon bust** This kind of composition is very obvious and easy to scout with your first obs. You'll need to wallin with gateways at your natural. Get a normal army composition, colossi asap after your robo finishes, and you'll be more than fine.

Builds I'm still trying to figure out:

* Various phenixes build (if scouted early I guess a 5gate blink followup is best, like stated in [the TL Sase's build](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=339898)).
* (Edit) Some warp prisms plays? Is it a counterbuild? (Credits to LannisterStarcraft)

Being a bit of a build-hoarder I have responded to a number of request threads since joining this subreddit, with good responses.

Here are 2 PvZ builds which I like to use, and you may want to try. All of them begin with a standard FFE with 2 gas and variations occur after ~28 supply.

**1) MC's 4-Gate pressure with DT follow-up**

*This build is great fun to use because it is straightforward, powerful, and a bit sneaky. The main tipping point involves securing forward pylons until the dark shrine finishes.*

FFE&gt; Zealot, +1 attack, Warpgate (Chrono both 3-4 times)

30 pylon

|| Stalker

40 3x Gate, Twilight council (brief probe cut)

42 Pylon, Stalker

48 2x gas (push out to place pylons)

|| Dark shrine, +2 attack

|| Warp in 4 zealots and pressure the third base

|| Warp in 4 more zealots

~65 Robo 

|| DS finishes, make 4 DTs and kill the natural, then split them up

~70 3x Gate

|| Blink, +3 attack, observer

~100 3rd Base

If you kill the third you are in good shape. If you kill the third and natural you are in amazing shape. If you kill all his bases (this has happened to me in Masters) you will probably be laughing uncontrollably.

**2) Genius' Stargate into Twilight**

*This is my default build against 2 base play because it is ridiculously safe. IMO Stargate is the best way to play against fast lair as it will scout the tech quickly and gives harass options.*

FFE&gt;Zealot (no Warpgate, no +1)

30 Gas

31 Pylon

34 Stargate, followed by WG research

34 Sentry

38 Gas

40 Pylon

|| Sentry

~46 Void Ray

50 Pylon

|| Phoenix

56 3x Gate, +1 attack

|| Continue phoenix production to 4 or 5. Stay sentry heavy (~8-10)

~85 Twilight Council, 3x Gate

~100 3rd Base

You may swap the TC for a Robo if burrow is suspected.

2. What is the standard protoss metagame vs all three races? I expect that with the new units and with a 7 month gap, the metagame will be pretty different.

3. How is the SC2 community? Some of my friends that play LoL have been saying that SC2 is dead because everyone switched over to LoL. Is this true? :(

Now this is no doubt mostly due to my opponents not knowing how to deal it, but I think it is at least semi stable (it is stable unless blindly countered) up to low masters. I have beaten high master league players with it, players whose macro and micro is far better than mine so to me that means it's at least not complete garbage.

I didn't post it after I had written it because I couldn't be bothered to look through all my replays to find my PvZs and the ones where I had used it, so I am simply posting it as is, apologizing for the low number of replays and encouraging you to simply try it out for yourself and I will gladly post your replays at the end of the guide. 

So without further ado (sp?), [The No-GG PvZ Skytoss build](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1cWh9_wXEdbnTNWNPHZnwkQRP3HJIFEeAnDwvHPGhFAY) (named because I think I have gotten 1 or 2 ggs out of 30 or so wins vs Zergs). 

I post it here not only to give you some sweet sweet ladder points to but to encourage discussion, what are the weaknesses of this build, what are good simcities to make it work better, how to optimize it. But  before you say ""this gets countered by [X]"" please read the guide and actually post a game of this happening. 

... I am not quite sure how to end this, so I'll just write entaru adun fellow Protosses, bring death from above as Tassadar did! 

EDIT: If you've tried it out, please post results and replays here! First because I want to see if there are things you are doing wrong/badly, or things you are doing well, that I should add to the guide (if it's not in there) and because currently people just have to trust me alone that it works and more is always better.

1343135863.0,21,self.allthingsprotoss,x2knx,Question about macro'ing as a toss and understanding matchups,smj32091,23,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/x2knx/question_about_macroing_as_a_toss_and/,"It seems that toss is a mix between zerg and terran macro.  We have gateways for producing units rapidly like zerg and we also have production facilities make units over time in a queue like terran.    
    
    
IIRC For zerg their macro mechanics come in phases, they spend their money and larvae on a phase of drones or a phase of units, and usually only make units when they want to push or defend. For Terran it's the opposite they make workers and queue their units so its a more continuous flow of units instead of an intermittent surge of units like zerg.  All races including toss to my understanding usually sacrifice units when they progress on the tech tree.    
    
    

Now toss is a bit of both races. Warpgate units can be instantly warped in given that the warpgates aren't on cooldown and other tech path units from the robotics bay or stargate are produced in a queue.  Since this is a bit of both I'm guessing we have some of the advantages of both macro styles.  Like a zerg we can replenish our armies very quickly, and rally a large amount of forces in a small amount of time for a timing attack or defense.  Like a terran we are able to have a continuous stream of units from our nexus and higher tiered tech facilities, making our income much more predictable and consistent when compared to a zerg while also not forcing us to choose between drones or units.     
    
     

Now here's my question. Because we have a bit of both macro mechanics, how I should approach macro'ing?    
     
    
Versus terran, I am told that our lategame tech is very formiddable. Midgame and Earlygame we are very fragile.  This forces me to believe that I should tech and also build an economy for lategame, therefore I should play more like a zerg and my priorities for spending money in this order would be 1. economy 2. tech 3. units. This means after each cycle of income, I would warp in or produce units with the money I have remaining and not worry how many production facilities I'm not using.     
     
   
Versus Zerg it's the exact opposite. Their lategame is very dangerous due to the amount of units they can produce.  Midgame and earlygame we must do damage in order to stay equal or ahead with their economy.  This means we should play more like an aggressive terran  and prioritize our money in this fashion. 1. economy 2. units 3. tech.  This means I would use try to use all the production facilities available and use the remaining money for tech.  With my large amount of units I would attempt to do damage to a zerg such as denying or killing their third after a FFE.

It started out as a normal game. I got up to 3 bases with a strong army composition vs his (ling ultra). I had a lot of immortals, zealots, some colossus and stalkers, and I think an archon or two. I ended up destroying his army while he only tried to counter attack with lings. He then made 25 muta's while I had a low stalker count (due to trying to counter his army comp) and just sent them to my base. He made only muta's after that really and I couldn't warp in enough stalkers to deal with it.

I am not crying imbalance but I have no clue how to deal with a zerg who loses an army comp that requires an extreme response (zealot, archon, immortal) and then completely tech switches to a super fast air unit that can get to the opponents base before they can warp in enough stalkers to defend it?",,False,self,t5_2tkqb,False,,m,True,t3_1dwwly,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/1dwwly/how_do_you_deal_with_zergs_who_sacrifice_their/,

Ok, to review the carrier's general mechanics: It has a launch range of 8. That means it must be within 8 range to deploy its interceptors. Once they are out, they can continue to attack target out to the leash range of 14. Interceptors will return once one of the following conditions happens:

* The carrier is issued a stop command
* The current target dies and no other target is available within launch range.
* The current target dies and the carrier is now on move command
* The target leaves the leash zone, aka the distance between target and carrier exceeds 14 (regardless of how that happened, carrier moved away, target moved away, recall, etc)

The important takeaway here is that giving a carrier a move command won't by itself force a return, the interceptors will keep attacking the target until either the carrier/target moves beyond 14 range or the target dies. Also, a return between targets isn't necessary, it just sometimes looks like it is because there is no marker between launch and leash radius. The new target has to be within launch radius (8) for the interceptors to come straight across to it.

Now, we know the carrier cannot launch on the move, and when on a-move, will simply park while the interceptors take down a target. It will then continue towards the a-move target point. So it moves in this sort of pattern: Stop at max launch range, launch, kill, return, scoot forward, stop, launch, etc. There's a great deal of time spent docking and relaunching interceptors and moving forward, and since in WoL there is no heal-on-dock like in BW, there is no real benefit to all this.

But hey wait a minute. Remember what I said above? The the carrier CAN move while attacking, it just won't by default? And that interceptors can re-enage without returning provided the next target is already within range 8? So. While your squadron blasts away one target, you can move command the carriers forward, getting within launch distance of the original target, and the interceptors will come straight to it. Changing the pattern to: Stop at max launch range, launch, kill, sweep across, kill, sweep across, kill, etc. To do it, simply target fire on something (interceptors largely do not overkill, so you should pretty much always target fire carriers unless you are up against units with less than 100 or so HP), then move forward a little, a-move or target fire again, move forward...is this pattern sounding familiar?

Yes, that's right. You can stutter-step carriers, causing the interceptors to chain-kill targets without ever docking. It's just a very slow (and slightly weird) stutter-stepping. Once you get the tempo down on this one, it's pretty shocking how fast carriers can wipe out a base compared to just a-moving through it. You can also use this to chase down fleeing brood lord packs. Have fun!


Notes:

* Be careful not to target fire on a new target before the current one is dead, the interceptors will break off the current target to chase it. If you screw this up, you can get left with a bunch of buildings/thors/brood lords all with 30 HP. It usually works best to move forward, then shift-queue the target-fire command on the next target. That way the interceptors will come straight over once the first target drops.
* Have graviton catapult for this, it makes it about 70% more forgiving when you botch the distance or timing and accidentally cause all your interceptors to fly home
* Leash mechanic applies to the current target of course, so you can get up to 14 squares away from it to get in position for the next salvo. If you are directly between targets A and B, that's a max of 22 squares that between chained-targets.
* Not only do your interceptors not have to return, since they can fly across in a pack, they attack all at once rather than in a line.

tl:dr; you can make carriers attack BW-style (kinda) by stutter-stepping them.",,False,self,t5_2tkqb,False,,platinum,True,t3_13hyrz,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/13hyrz/litte_carrier_micro_trick_i_dont_see_mentioned/,

(old x/post from r/Starcraft_Strategy),DUCKVILLELOL,22,4,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/10v9j7/because_watching_colossus_vs_colossus_battles_is/,"Carriers.

I'm not joking - though I have no illusions that this is some ""METAGAME CHANGING"" build or something, but it can be done, however you need to be crisp and very aware of scouting, and aware of ""army values"".

Opening up Stargate seems to work nicely on NA (I'm Diamond on there, was previously plat on KR) as not too many people around my level know how to deal with it properly. But you get a few Phoenix(nix) out, and as per [this game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs8NecsaFsA) between our local [/r/starcraft_strategy](/r/starcraft_strategy) member Xujhan - use them to scout out the lay of the land, and get a few kills.

However I decided to (and this originate on KR not NA) go a little further with it, and say ""what if I pretend I'm a zerg..."" and go for upwards of 10 nix to really try and harass my opponent and keep them in their base while I expand. Now I know this is actually the whole purpose of doing a nix opening, however most of the time people will get 3-5 or so, then stop and focus on ""normal"" units like robo tech and so forth. This goes for far more of them at the cost of ground units, which may seem strange however as you'll see in some of my replays here, with a large contingent of nix you can still defend things - providing you have **good scouting and army value awareness.**

After the nix opening, depending on what your opponent is doing and how they react to your nix, you'll want to expand quickly to get the third/fourth gasses up which of course are vital. You'll want to also chuck down 2, maybe 3 cannons depending on how safe you feel based on the scouting from the Phoenix. A robo can be handy to make sure you have 1 obs to remove enemy obs and lookout for DT's, however I've found that with very careful and studious cannon placements from an early forge; you can negate both of those things - however that's a personal choice, I've been on a cannon binge lately; getting them in large numbers in all matchups for fun.

There is a certain point where you'll probably need to defend the ""big push"" from your opponent who'll be annoyed at the way the play goes down - this is where nix control and keeping them alive the whole game is very important. You'll be down on ground units obviously because you've spent more on the nix, and hopefully you'll have the adequate cannon amount for what you scouted coming. Just lift ALL THE THINGS and do the damage you can, a couple of the replays below have nice examples of dealing with that first push. The great thing is - once you defend against it - you're in a great position. Because depending on how they play, the next push will come when a couple of the carriers are out and you'll be fine then, and then fine after that... and so on. :)

Anyway, at a certain point you'll want to get a second stargate - if your opponent commits to heavily defending the nix early in the game by building cannons (2 or more) in their mineral lines at the main/nat and/or going for high stalker count with blink - you'll need to be more careful with your nix because they need to **stay alive the whole damn game** because the harassment and graviton beam are crucial to your defense and ""time buying"" part of this playstyle - as I said, pretend you're a zerg droning up behind muta harass. :)

Depending on what you see, you can start Carrier production off the 2 bases - and as everyone knows, once you get to around 6-7 they are actually very hard to stop. You'll need to keep a constant vigil on what your opponent is up to of course; if you see him moving out, you'll need to prepare to graviton beam like a boss, put more cannons down, that sort of thing. Safe to say; if you see your opponent getting a third, you get one too. Once 2-3 carriers are out and your opponent hasn't taken one, you can feel safe in moving out to take yours because you should be fine to defend it.

Upgrades are kinda required, however obviously you'll need to be careful as to when you get them. If your opponent also opens Stargate/nix you might need to get +1 for armour/weapons quick, or one of those, just so you can make sure you have air superiority and also nice ups for your carriers once they are on the field.

I've had various responses to seeing some nix -&gt; carriers - ranging from quite odd - people getting templar and archons only (which is cute, you can feedback the nix obviously, but after that it's pointless) - to the far far more common mass blink stalker. Some people do an archon/stalker combo - in the end I think if you are at the stage where you need to defend against this you need to do one of two things: push out very early WITHOUT regard for probes back home, almost like an all in - however if you have a couple of cannons you should keep some alive - or get 3/3/3 and blink on stalkers ASAP. I'm not talking ""cool bro I have 3/3/3 at the 34 minute mark"" I mean super fast. Triple robo if you have to. Because the only thing that has really beaten me down with this is that one play, because obviously stalkers are nice and mobile, and with huge ups they will smash carriers even when carriers get close to the tipping point.

Another big weakness as noted in the seperate thread is that a blink stalker timing early on can really wreck your shit if it's done right. I personally don't feel that phoenix openings are ""way more vulnerable"" than any other style - it's a matter of how your opponent utilises their stalkers and their blink. But, I'll admit you can have trouble on maps where the main is open to blink-ins such as Korhal, Shakuras (just cannon rush that map imo) and similar maps. I'm yet to think of a ""simple"" way to deal with it, given that you can have trouble getting a decent ground army up because you're focusing on nix, but still. 

Extra side-notes to think about which you may want to think about for me because I'm lazy:

* Getting the nix onion-crystal upgrade can (no joke) be worth it sometimes. I've gotten it on a couple of occasions - it can really help if your opponent is being stubborn and still continues to get colossi with blink stalkers - keeping the nix out of range of the stalkers as much as possible is a huge thing. But again - the trouble I've been having with the build is dealing with blink stalkers, not with colossi.

* I have no idea what is the most cost efficient and useful for the air upgrades - I would assume that given the interceptors shoot twice you'd want to get weapons as a priority over armour - however if you're facing off against mass stalkers (which as pointed out many times is the **most common** defense) - you may want armour, given that it'll negate both parts of a single stalker volley. This needs some more theorycrafting 

* Chargelots are something that work quite nicely with the carriers as both a meatshield and also as damage dealers against stalkers. If you position them right they can be quite useful in blocking out the stalkers - or if you hold them under the carriers when stalkers blink under them to attack you'll shread them easily.

* Having a mothership can be very very nice of course, however personally I wouldn't recommend it. Interceptors will fall into vortexes, and depending on positioning and the gravity (no pun intended) of what you're dealing with, you can lose a battle from your *own* vortex. I'm not saying don't do it - just make sure you think very hard before you place a vortex down if you get to that stage. Mass recall however would be my use of choice for a mothership if you get to it, rush up to an opponent's expo, kill it, recall back. Similar to very very late stage PvT in Brood War. 

**Again with my little disclaimer: I'm in no way a pro at playing Protoss, I just like taking fun styles into my matches. I'm also not claiming that this will change the matchup at all, so if you bitch at me about ""RARRRR THIS WON'T WORK AT HIGH LEVEL"" expect me to not reply because I KNOW THAT. I do however think there's more potential than people give it, and if a scrub like me can do ok with it at a diamond level perhaps some of you masters guys might be able to work with it. Also worth noting that I don't have a particular build down - I play to what I see and also whether I'm drunk or not.**

Remember this last little piece of advice: This is a **fun** build, not a ""GET ME TO MASTERS BRO"" build. The aim is to try and have some fun practicing your phoenix micro, and also trying to stick one up Dustin Browder for threatening to remove the carrier. Also: **BE THE ZERG. HARASS WITH THOSE MUTAS(PHOENIX) AND KEEP YOUR OPPONENT IN HIS BASE!** If you keep your opponent in there and force him to screw around making many stalkers and cannons and such while you're spending the 8284 minutes it takes to build a carrier, you're in a good spot. Measure your opponent's army and calculate the cannons you need to defend if he pushes, and remember to LIFT ALL THE THINGS! if he attacks.

Terran opens 2 rax, makes 5 or so marines, then pulls all SCVs and attacks. This hits while toss has maybe 2 units available. It's also very hard to scout effectively.

I even switched to terran myself to try this out and it's sickeningly easy to do. I'm 4-0 with this all-in. 

Cleverest response I've seen so far is to wall the top of ramp with pylons while the units are approaching -- but this still didn't stop me from beating the guy.

What's the best response? I think I'll start going with a 3-stalker rush opening in PvT, because it's the only thing I can think of that stands a chance...

Edit: some very good answers. To summarize what I've learned:

- target marines not SCVs.

- scout early and kite with stalkers 

- get a super-early mothership core. Probably most fail-safe answer.

- alternately, early sentry to FF ramp.",,False,self,t5_2tkqb,1367290183.0,,,True,t3_1dd0l6,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/1dd0l6/beating_the_terran_scv_pull_allin/,

* PvZ: Hit F for Forcefield only to accidentally hit Photon Overcharge. Threw away two games that were otherwise in the bag thanks to this. (Made a separate thread about it too.) This includes a successfully held-off 6-pool, which is doubly shitty.
* PvZ: Didn't react to a tech switch to Mutas. At all.
* PvT: Didn't scout a hidden expansion on Bel'shir Vestige.
* Meta: Played too much Unranked. Won 4 in a row in Unranked only to lose 4 in a row in Ranked. Now I'm 8 games down.

What I learned from last week:

* Never got supply blocked in the early game.
* Most of my losses were strategy related rather than mechanics related, unlike last week.

Whenever a bronze-gold leaguer asks tips on a timing attack, build order, or how to play against a specific race they get the same shitty answers every time.


- Constantly Build probes
-Dont get supply blocked
-Spend money + Expand

I understand that these are basically the 3 key components of macro and i think even bronze-gold leaguers understand this concept relatively easily, its not really a helpful tip considering anyone who's played starcraft more than ten times knows this. I think when lower level players ask for tips on timings, all-ins and complicated strategies like that we should fill them in so they can experiment and find out why it cant work within the skill set while getting familiar with builds they will need down the road. 

Im not complaining or saying this isn't a helpful subreddit because it is I'm just saying i see higher level players constantly demoralizing lesser skilled players convincing them not to experiment with complicated play styles lol I'm sure all master league players on this subreddit experimented with all-ins, phoenix openings, and other strategies way before they were supposed to.. i understand why everyone tells lesser skilled players these things but there are more aspects to winning a game of starcraft then building probes, not getting supply blocked and spending money. All your really doing is deterring lower level players from trying challenging builds and really acquiring there own play style through trial and error.


**TO ALL LOWER LEAGUE PLAYERS** You must experiment with different builds to understand micro and unit composition or you'll find yourself completely lost during high level exchanges even if you have great macro. Never forget the 4 main points at the beginning of the post, but also dont be afraid to be whacky and experimentative.

This is a series called TerranUp2Base and I found it amazing, it got my Terran almost on par with my Protoss in about a week of seriously trying to improve my offrace.  I find that style of content really helpful, you have a detailed game plan, you get to see what happens in a variety of situations, etc.

I was thinking of doing something similar for my PvT, for starters.  1 gate FE into double forge as early as possible (CreatorPrime style), 2 observers then 2 immortals, blink before charge, 3gates up to 6gates, colossus while expanding, 3 colossus then switch to archon, push out at ~18 minutes at 3-3, 200/200, 3 colossus with range, chargelot/archon etc.

There's tons of stuff to cover there!  The basic macro of it all, where to allocate chronoboost, observer positioning, what to be wary of, then looking at individual problems; dealing with 2rax, what to do when you see a 1-1-1, stalker and observer positioning to deal with drops, etc.

I, like I'm sure many of you, was watching the Proleague series between STX_SOUL and SKT1.  In game 6, Trap executed a beautiful PvP all-in against Bisu to set up Innovation for the win in the ace match.

This all-in opened with a Gateway on 10 supply in order to rush out the fastest warpgate timing possible (WARPGATE FINISHES AT 5:15 O_o).  Hell, the SECOND warp-in happens before 6 minutes.  

So this build got me thinking... 4gate is dead in HotS because the MSC always has enough energy to stay safe for a whole 60 seconds - in which time you can get the units, tech, or economy you need to hold it off.  But this build hits LONG before the MSC has enough energy at all!  **It hits your opponent with 5 Stalkers and a Zealot at 5:30.**

Thoughts: The 16 pylon at the natural is a great way to get a fast wall in against annoying speedling allins. 7 phoenix is an interesting number, and he gets them out so quickly. I feel that five phoenix may be good too. Z simply aren't used to stargate units coming out this fast, so you should be able to do a looot of damage. Also, sOs does some cute stuff not noted in the build. He builds a proxy pylon in sight of Effort's zerlings just so his MSC can get some free kills before he cancels it. He also uses the MSC to attack the building third to damage it. He doesn't do anything from that damage, but he may in some games warp in some zealots to go kill it. 

On another note, Trap did a realllly similar build. This seems to be fresh in the Korean metagame right now. Try it out!

1.) What is the best way to learn to organize and control your army. I never feel like i get the maximum damage I could be getting because I don't control my army properly.

2.) How do I protect against reapers? even when i have three or for zealots and two stalkers I cant fight them off.

3.) How can I prevent oracles from doing damage early? I always seem to lose 9-12 probes to them early, how can I prevent it?

4.) What are some tips on better managing my time. I often get in an attack and forget to be rebuilding my army, or expanding.

5.) are there any specific videos you would recommend I watch? If so please link them.

6.) I am terrible at scouting, I never remember to do it. Just please give some tips.

7.)What are some key protoss build orders I that every protoss player should learn.

Edit: Make that 10. http://drop.sc/330737. I'm going to go ahead and say that this is as perfect an execution of this build as can be expected from a player my level. very proud of how I played this game.

These are my last 9 games, which is my current win streak vs terran. (17-7 in the last two weeks)

After going back and looking I only had one game vs the true marine/SCV allin, which is how this originally came up. The other game was against an improvised allin after I damaged him on the push, and he didn't pull all his SCVs, just most of them.

Enjoy, and if you have any questions, ask:

http://drop.sc/330690 – Executed the early game very poorly, but the late game very well. I was late on my gas, delaying my push. I built my zealot before cyber for some reason, and I built my stalker before the MSC. All mistakes. Terran opens cc first on the low ground with bunker. I run past and kill some SCVs, and force a lift on the expand. Send the MSC to mineral line to harass, while my zealot/stalker prevent him from leaving the bunker. I total killing 5 SCVs and 5 marines, but lose all of my units. Behind this I’ve put up an expand, and built a stargate. He counters with widow mine/marine drop, while I oracle harass him. I fend off the drop with my second oracle and stalker, losing a total of seven probes. (41 probes to 28 SCVs at this point) Fun thing I did with my harassing oracle: You can scare him into running his line sometimes even if you don’t activate your beam. Oracles keep him at home, while I macro up to colossi/immortal/stalker/chargelot/sentry/void ray/carrier/archon. (I am not exaggerating.) Very little is going to beat that composition, especially when I’ve been up 10-20 workers the entire game. Indeed it doesn’t.

http://drop.sc/330691 – If you want an exact “build order” I executed this one really well. I got a second gas early, though, which is optional. Second gas early generally means I’m going to follow it up with stargate before expand instead of after. Guy was random, but was nice enough to tell me his race. He went for fast concussive shells, which stopped my push. I run the stalker/zealot and kill the few marines with my MSC. He hits with the marauders, but accomplishes nothing, with zealots on the ramp. I build a void ray first to defend because of the aggression, then I go into oracles. I push with a 5 gate, 2 szealots, stalker, and a void ray, while I harass the main with an oracle, killing 10 workers. (35 to 16 at this point). I macro into sentry/voidray/immortal/chargelot and go end it.

http://drop.sc/330692 – Guy sends two scv scouts, so I know something’s up. It’s proxy concussive marauders! Kill the scouts with zealot/MSC, he brings three marines, I micro and kill all his units without losing anything, expanding behind it. I attack with my three units, and kill the 5 marines at home, but lose my zealot. His proxy sends a marauder at my expansion. I recall home, at which point he ggs.

http://drop.sc/330693 – Marine/SCV allin. I scout it with my zealot/MSC, and run home. Zealot dies on the way. By the time he gets here, I have energy for photon overcharge, which traps him in a corner of my base. I get out stalkers, and utilize the art of micro to kill him. I did really badly and got supply blocked a bunch but I still held it off pretty easily, since I had teched up to oracles at this point.

http://drop.sc/330694 – Reaper harass – I fend it off with my second stalker and expand behind my push. Kill a supply depot to get in, and micro war with him for a bit. End up killing a few SCVs and making him pull his line, but I lose my stalker and MSC. The real damage is done with dual oracle harass. I get up to three bases, and he does a push, but I’m just barely able to hold it off with archon/zealot/void ray + warpins. (I was going storm because I’m bad at using storm, so I didn’t have my hts turned into archons, so they weren’t very helpful.) At this point it’s 45 workjers to 33, and I’m a base up. He tries another push, but I hold it off with (preformed) archon/zealot/void/sentry. Warpin to kill the drop he did on my natural and push with my main army, which took almost no damage, for the win.

http://drop.sc/330695 – He opens reapers. It doesn’t work, as usual. I hit as his bunker finishes, but only two marines are able to get in. I run past and force him to pull his line to defend. I kite the heck out of his SCVs (With the help of timewarp) and kill three (and a bunch of marines) before getting stalker/msc out. I send my MSC back in later to harass the mineral line, and recall it home when it gets trapped. Send in the first oracle and kill what few marines he has left, and start on the mineral line, at which point he leaves.

http://drop.sc/330696 – This was a fun one. Proxy two rax + bunker. I didn’t scout it at all. No scout? No problem. I kill the SCV making the second bunker with my zealot before he can finish it, and then pull probes to finish off the second SCV. The MSC helps. Stalker gets out and forces a cancel of the second bunker. At this point it’s the standard kiting micro that normally happens, it’s just going on in my base instead of his. Stalker vs marine micro ensues. Stalkers win. I fight him off, but he’s expanded. I sit my stalkers outside his bunkers in front and send my oracle to his line to harass. He can’t send to fight the oracle or he will lose the front to the stalkers (this is kind of the whole crux of this strategy) Between the oracle in his natural and the one in his main, I killj 20 SCVs, making it 9 to 38. He does a push, but five marines and two marauders does not commonly beat 6 stalkers, an immortal, and two oracles. I get some more units and go kill him.

http://drop.sc/330697 – He opens CC on the highground behind wall. He has three marines to defend my push. Micro ensues. I kill 7 workers, 2 supply depots, and 6 marines before he pushes me back. I lose my MSC and zealot. I reinforce with a second stalker and bait his army out of his base, while my oracle hits his line. It racks up another 8 worker kills and 4 marine kills before being forced away. He counters with a 13 marine push before I warp in and push it away. He does some damage (7 probes) but it’s not too bad. Utilizing the art of micro, the oracle gets another two workers. I bait out his army again, and kill it outright this time, while sending a second oracle in to kill his natural. After getting down to 5 SCVs (vs 40 probes), he leaves.

http://drop.sc/330698 – This was a really funny game. He proxied a factory and lifted it into my main, and built a widow mine. What I *should* have done was pulled probes and attacked the mine, so he couldn’t get to my line or had to burrow away from it. I didn’t think of that. Instead, the mine got 12 of my probes before I could get an obs out. But that wasn’t really so bad; I was only behind by a worker (Thanks, chronoboost!) He does a marine/mine push but the mine shoots at my zealot, which has caught up to his marines, meaning it detonated right on top of all his marines. I had a good laugh. At this point it transitions into a pretty regular macro game, except he’s going Mech. I scout the mech with my oracle. (well, really I scout that he’s rung his *entire base* in turrets, which means he’s turtling, which means mech.) Fortunately for me, mech will never be viable in TvP no matter how hard they try. I poke with some voids, kill a tank, but his ravens bomb me to death. (Protip: If you have an air unit targeted by seeker missle, run it over the opposing army, the splash will damage them.) There’s an engagement: A primarily thor/tank army fares about as well as you’d expect vs 8 immortals. I counter and win. He BMs me and leaves.

I just wanted to get a sense from everybody what their hotkeys are.  I'm curious about:

1) what you use each control group for
2) if you've remapped your control groups
3) what you use camera hotkeys for
4) if you've remapped your camera hotkeys
5) anything else you'd like to share that's interesting

In addition to this, I'm looking to see if people have suggestions for mouse buttons or macro keys on a keyboard (I don't think the macro keys are allowed for tournaments, not sure about the mouse, but still curious).  I use a Death Adder mouse and a Black Widow keyboard, both from Razer.  Has anyone remapped some hotkeys onto the mouse or macro keys?

I built a new [Advanced Search](http://ggtracker.com/matches/search) system for replays.

Let's say you want to find Platinum-level replays where Protoss beats Zerg, just to get inspired.  Or you specifically want to see Plat-level Protoss beating Zerg with mutas.

With a few clicks now you can see replays like that.  Check out [Plat Protoss beating Zerg with mutas](http://ggtracker.com/matches/search#?race=protoss&amp;vs_race=zerg&amp;one_wins&amp;unit_two=mutalisk&amp;page=1&amp;average_league=3).

Is this sort of thing useful?  I can add more bells and whistles, more ways to search, but before I do I'd like to hear from the community about what would be useful.

Also is it obvious how to use it?  You click on race icons to pick which races, you can click on WINNER if you only want to see games where a certain race wins, and you can pick specific units and times if you want.

I'm NOT going to post this in allthingsterran or allthingszerg because I play Protoss and we Protoss should stick together right??  :)

I was playing around with it a bit and I think I've improved it to a pretty solid level of refinement. The build is as follows: 

9 pylon

13 gate (scout for proxies in main and natural, then go back to mining)

15 gas

16 pylon

18 core (scout)

19 gas (put 2 on this gas when it finishes)

20 gate

21 wg (chrono), stalker (chrono)

24 pylon (cut probes)

24 twilight

24 stalker x 2 (put 3 on second gas when both queued)

28 probe x 2 (cut probes again after these ones)

30 blink (spend rest of chrono on blink)

30 gate x 2

30 pylon (proxied)

42/42 hit after 4 stalker warp in (2nd warp in) and blink finished and build an aggressive proxy pylon 

You should be spending three chronos on probes, 1 on warpgate, 1 on your first stalker and the rest on blink. Warp gate finishing and the second two gateways time out really nicely so that you get a warp in of two stalkers when wg finishes, and four right as blink finishes, which lets you hit with 9 blink stalkers at around 7:00. If you see anything wrong with the build or you know of a more optimized version feel free to let me know. I'm not claiming to have invented this or anything, I just thought I'd share my findings.

Note: This is not a standard playstyle. It is very all-in, and only works if you do tremendous damage with your initial attack. It is also fairly hard countered by robo openers and can be reasonably held by safer phoenix openers as well. Use at your own risk.

Today I cranked out around 15 games with one of my Z practice partners and I won 2 of them. I'm just so frustrated against them and can't really seem to get good against them.

I'm a high master protoss player who is currently living in a gaming house in Warsaw called ministryofwin (some of you have probably seen the TL topic). The house hosts have given us our xsplit licenses and so on, so I (and others) can start streaming our play. :)

In 8 hours I will start to stream ladder games, if there are enough people to start a conversation, I will respond and will happily answer questions [about the games I played]. As you can see from my profile, I have a lot of games played, play consistently vs GMs and I pride myself on my strong pvt and pvz lategame.  ;)

I'm certain the majority of the masters players here could learn something from me. :P

Liquid`HerO has always been one of my favorite Protoss players to watch and try to emulate.  Especially because of how well he plays (in case you didn't know this, he won 3rd place at the MLG Spring Championship 2013).  One of the best parts of his play style is his ability to hitting opponent’s with seemingly unending harassment, without ever fully committing his army for a head-on push.  

HerO recently showcased a PvZ build that fits with this signature play style both on ladder and at MLG in the past two weeks.  I've been on the look-out for a macro PvZ build that opens with a Stargate for quite some time now, and this build not only qualifies, but is also just really strong.

This week's build orders are going to be:

* PvP - [Hwangsin's Stargate Expand](http://imbabuilds.com/hots-protoss/hots-pvp/pvp-hwangsins-stargate-expand/)

I've been hard pressed to find another PvP build with the same safety yet aggressive capabilities as this build. I've found 1 Base Stargate all-ins to be very strong against this build but I haven't faced enough to consider them a complete counter.

* PvZ - [Phoenix into Macro](http://jaypowersc2.com/page/story/4/)

My weakest PvZ moments are certainly against Mutalisks and when getting a third. Opening with a Stargate should solve both problems. I still need to get used to timings for getting the third as well as macroing while controlling the Phoenixes. Still, I believe this to be a step in the right direction in approaching a Macro PvZ game on even footing.

I'm looking forward to analysing Stardust's PvZ builds from Dreamhack. I was a bit disappointed considering that the build does not deal with the Mutalisk problem but it's always good to have another all-in in my arsenal.

* PvT - [Rain's 1 Gate FE](http://imbabuilds.com/hots-protoss/hots-pvt/)

I haven't had the opportunity to fully flesh out the build's potential as most games ended up against proxy Widow Mines for some reason. From the few games that I did manage to enter into a macro game against a Terran I ended up trapped in my base without a third. At the end of the week I started getting used to how I should move around while taking a third and saw a glimpse of what Late game could be like. I almost felt like a Zerg.

Everygame my intention is to go my standard PvT opening which can be found here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_FlwEcjwYs ! Ofcourse through scouting and adapting my build changes often (eg 18 nexus in response to CC first)

Here I have 6 games from my livestream where I went 6-0  in PvT, all the videos are separate gamess and here I'll give a brief description of each game so people will know what they wanna watch. Replays are in youtube description :)


PS. I'm currently in the process of creating a standard/follow up tutorial but still playing with ideas. Hit me up if you have any thoughts about this :)



So here goes! Game #1 on Whirlwind (13:28)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEHdrrR0BMs


My opponent goes CC first, I scout this early and react with 18 nexus and follow it up with a 1gate/1 robo high templers and 9:40 third into midgame tech switch to double robo collos which end the game when I push with around 5/6.


Game #2 Starstation (15:11)

Super standard from both players, collos into third base into HT while defending from drops, I take small loses and move out to catch my opponents army offguard, with storm + collo I push him back to his base where I use my proxy pylons to reinforce immediately and do strong damage which in the long run wins me the game


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfivZFRXOZI


Game #3 Klontas Mire (12:22)

My opponent goes 2 rax reaper without be seeing second rax. I get annoyed after so many reapers and move out with my early units to pressure back. We each lose a few units and workers and end around even going into a macro game. I go collos and scout a third inbase CC and so I prepare to all in as he takes it. His units get caught off guard on my side of the map and I take a very easy win.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfve-5z75qs


Game #4 Belshire (15:34)

My opponent opens with a gas/nno reaper so I take a second gas instead and play safe. He goes bio tank. we have a few fights, he cancels my expo' forces me to all in, I do damage, we continue playing macro game and end up with the win. Was a bit of a whacky/non standard game.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbLh6zpkmQE


Game #5 Zerus Prime (14:44)
1 base reaper into 111 widow mine pressure with expansion. i dont lose much because of a great scout. he sees my robo bay while dropping, i go 1 collo fake into HT's and play a macro game where i beat him.


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udWGr2d2Y1o


Game #6 Belshire (16:55)

Super standard game from both of us, 1 rax gasless expansion into bio. lots of harassment by both players and i end up winning a very long base trade with 1 probe mining at a fresh nexus. super close game :)

We the mods have been discussing how to deal with stream posts as many of you may know. Well, we are not fully done with how we are approaching it, but we feel this will be the most elegant solution for now.

If you do not delete your stream posts you will be:

1. Given a warning from one of the mods

If this continues and you get multiple warning in a small spawn of time we will:

2. Ban you for a certain period of time from ATP.

And eventually should if continue in an extremely obtrusive manner, we may ban you outright, which honestly we don't want to do.

We just experienced our first ban, that of a full 24 hour period. Overall we hope this will self-moderate many of the stream posts, but until we can find a more elegant solution without disrupting community activities too much, this will be put in place. 

Thank you,

First the stats

**Hellbat**

* 2 supply
* 100m
* 135hp
* 9 dps /w splash
* 15 dps /w splash (light)

**Stalker**

* 2 supply
* 125m/50g
* 80hp/80s
* 6.9 dps
* 9.7 dps (armored)

I feel like Hellbats hard counter zealots and sentries, while stalkers can be exchanged for cost with medivac support. It seems like bats should be classed armored and not bio (no healing, stalker has higher dps). 


Some of the situations I have been struggling with

If my opponent is going Mech I will mix in Immortals and their anti-mech attacks go very well against Hellbats. But when combined with Bio or Bio/Tank I am running into difficulty. TeleVacs seem to ignore static defense and drop Hellbats into mineral lines and Stalkers take forever to destroy the bats while they are healed by vacs, then at the end of the fight, splash damage has thoroughly destroyed any probes. (Running probes seems even worse as the medivacs are faster and just drop onto the line)

If my opponent has pushed lategame and has gone Sky Terran (Raven/BC) with a Hellbat mineral dump. I have no idea. Voids get seeker missiled where I lose everything unless I run, but if I run Voids I lose everything else. If I try to standup fight with even supply carriers seeker/Yamato will destroy everything while their SCVs repair their army.

So, is there a preferred army composition for

1. Hellbats drops

2. Hellbat supported Bio/tank

3. Lategame Sky Terran with Hellbats as a mineral sink.",,False,self,t5_2tkqb,False,,,True,t3_184c40,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/184c40/can_we_talk_about_hellbats/,

TangSC here from Team All-Inspiration, and I'm excited to announce the launch of our team's pay-what-you-can coaching platform!  For the past three years, I've coached and been coached in StarCraft II, witnessing from both sides the immense impact that coaching can have on a player's skill and motivation.  

I believe without reservation that everyone benefits from the attention and guidance of the right people, but not everyone has the funds to hire an experienced coach.  Most coaches charge over 20$USD an hour, which for some students is impossible.  Over the years, I've had quite a few people who couldn't afford coaching contact me and ask for help. I always answer their questions and push them towards a learning resource that I think would help them, but in terms of 1-on-1 coaching, I just didn't have the time to do it myself.  

A few months ago, I first had the idea of a community coaching project that does not set an hourly rate but instead relies on donations from students and viewers to compensate the coaches and spur project growth.  I contacted several coaches to gauge their interest, and found many were hesitant to get involved in a project that does not guarantee a set hourly rate.  This may sound selfish on the part of the coach, but it's understandable - coaching is a business and I was asking them to take a risk.  

Despite this minor set-back, we're going to fight tooth-and-nail to get this project under way, because we genuinely believe that we will provide a helpful service by promoting an effective and entertaining learning platform.  I'm so thrilled to have the support of Team All-Inspiration, and several team members have already expressed their enthusiasm about the project and offered their time and resources to help get started.  

I'd like to ask for your trust and support, ATP, because without the support of the community we cannot reach the height of our potential.    

- TangSC

My question is quite simple and basic: I use to hit a 2 colossus timing in PvT at 12'00, and I'm doing pretty good with it, except for the times I get dropped.
It seems like this is the time when terrans usually want to (double) drop, and I can't count the amount of games I've lost to drops while hitting this timing and unsuccessfully basetrading.

So my question is: how do you handle drops like this on the back of a midgame timing? I can't just get 4 stalkers on both my natural and my main, and I really can't solely rely on warping.

How do you guys deal with these midgame drops? A shitton of observers? Canons? You go to the church on Sundays and pray not to get dropped?

I'm a chobo gold Protoss who's getting back into SC2 since HotS's release (was plat Protoss in WoL).  Does anyone have any suggestions on a build order (BO from here on out) (no 4gate all-ins) that at least expands to a 2nd base and is applicable for all 3 match-ups?  I realize that this one build won't be the ""best"" build for each match-up, but I want one consistent build that I can practice and work on my macro/micro/mechanics for the longer term (aka I don't want to just 4gate/cheese to diamond/masters and then realize I have no idea what I'm doing).  

The PvP and PvT BOs seem a lot more similar compared to the PvZ (this is based on gosubuilds.com BOs), but I'm fine with going with a slightly sub-optimal BO for all match-up if it means long term improvements instead of short-term ladder points.  And yes, I realize one needs to adjust their BO eventually to try to counter what their opponent is doing, so I'm looking for something as general purpose as possible.  It seems that twilight council might be the more general purpose BO atm (buff either stalkers/zealots or go high/dark templars or archons), but I might be under-estimating skytoss.

I've never quite understood when to use each one and the difference between them in terms of battle strategy because they both are strong vs light biological units and deal splash damage.

I only go templar into archon when I see my opponent making a lot of air to air units like vikings. The only thing I don't like about the colossus is that it can get sniped by ships so easily. Otherwise it seems like its better in every other way. It has a longer range and a nice sweeping attack. In a big ground battle protoss really needs that support from the back of the army and it works very well with forcefields. Against, say, a terran opponent who is making bio and vikings, i'll get templar instead of colossus to deal that area-damage that I need because they won't be countered by the vikings, and then I just morph them into archons when their energy is gone. In every other situation I make colossus.

 Is this a legit strategy? Are there other advantages each has over the other that I didn't mention? When do you guys like to use each unit? I feel like there's another advantage to archons that I'm not realizing. I don't actually know how the pros use them.

I mean how do you actually stop negative thinking and force positive thinking in relation to losses?

I've been getting fairly angry at losses recently. I think I've GGed on ladder maybe once in the past few weeks. I just don't feel like anything that has to do with me losing warrants a GG. I either feel like they played gimmicky and terrible, or I messed up somewhere.

I then get frustrated after I lose multiple games that way and eventually I just rage out and close starcraft and play something else. 

I know taking a break stops a rage fest after it has already started by my question to you is this:

How do you stop it from happening in the first place?

EDIT: I feel like I get frustrated much easier when I delve deeper into things. I used to love each and ever game I played of SC2 during the beta when I was shit and I knew I was shit. I find all FPS games unbelievably fun and relaxing because I'm not trying to be good at them. Once I try to be good at something or am good at something I think it angers me much more. I've noticed that with Starcraft, so far with biology in school (a class I loved last year when I was taking the normal class, but I'm not too sure how much I'm enjoying it now in my AP Class this year) does that say anything about my personality? Do other people experience the same thing etc.?

EDIT2: You guys are awesome. I got a lot of interesting ideas to help turn my losses into productivity and how to think a little more optimistically about the game. &lt;3 everyone and I'll continue providing constant content for you guys :]",,False,self,t5_2tkqb,1349889280.0,,herotest,True,t3_117s4y,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/117s4y/how_do_you_guys_manage_anger/,
1349202547.0,13,self.allthingsprotoss,10tuj6,Suggestion for phoenix: Make graviton beam work with flying units,hugolp,18,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/10tuj6/suggestion_for_phoenix_make_graviton_beam_work/,"I dont know if this idea can be implemented in WoL or it has to wait for HotS but if someone finds it useful I would appreciate if it can go into the US battlenet forums and suggest it.

__The problem__: For a long time it has fustrated me that the phoenix, which is supposed to counter mutas, can not be used against mutas unless they are already out in some numbers when the mutas hit. In general pros will tech up to archons and storm (and blink if they dont have it already) when they see mutas, instead of going phoenix. The problem is that in small numbers phoenix get eaten alive by mutas and they become useless, while its near impossible to outproduce the zerg. Phoenix can never achieve a meaningful number to counter mutas, unless they are already out.

__The solution__: So the idea is for graviton beam to work also in flying (non-masive) units. It would just hold the unit in place and unable their attack while the spell lasted. The point is now stalkers and phoenix can work together reinforcing each other. When the stalkers get to the mutas, the phoenix can use the graviton beam to hold some and kill them with the stalkers. Now it would make sense to go phoenix, even if they are in low numbers, in front of mutas because of this synergy between stalkers and phoenix. Its also quite micro intensive which is a plus.

How it does affect the rest of the units?

__Zerg__

* Overlords/Overseers: Not an issue. The only point might be that it can deny scouting a bit more efficiently, but phoenix already kill them quite quick.
* Corruptors: Corruptors decimate phoenix, I dont really see how holding a corruptor in place changes the mach up too much.
* Broodlords are massive and I dont have the beta so dont know about vipers.

__Protoss__

* Phoenix: Its already impossible to scape a phoenix vs phoenix battle so it makes no sense to use the graviton beam. The only issue is that one phoenix could hold an attacking phoenix for the stalkers to kill it, but it would not change it too much and could be interesting.

* Void Ray: Again, not many situations where holding a void ray matters. The void ray can not scape phoenix or stalkers already.

* Observer: If the observer is detected it dies extremely quick so, again, it would not change much.

* Warp prism: Phoenix are quicker than warp prism. While it can make it a bit more difficult for the warp prism because it can be hold in place, it would not change much.

* Dont have the beta so I can not give opinion on oracle or mothership core. The rest (mothership, carrier and tempest) are massive.

__Terran__

Here is where there is more change, but possitive IMO.

* Viking: I dont see how graviton beam used on vikings would change the match up a lot.

* Raven: Same.

* Medivac: It would help deal with medivacs since now drops can be freezed before they drop. This was not the reason why the idea came to me, but I think its a possitive change since its hard for the Protoss to open stargate in PvT (except for some specific counters). Blizzard dev's have said they would like to see more stargate play, and that even with the addition of the Oracle, Stargate opening is weak in PvT and they are looking in ways of solving it. This change could help making an stargate opening viable in PvT since it can help defend drops and allows for all (or most of) the units to be in the front, unlike now. It also increases micro needed (phoenix almost always requires more micro to be honest).

* Banshee: It would help deal with banshees since they could be hold in place and avoid them scaping. Since they are slower, Banshee's already can not scape Phoenix's anyway unless they cloack and there is no detection. Basically same idea as with medivacs, it makes stargate openings more viable in PvT

* Battlecruiser is massive.



Initially I though it would be a great change for WoL, where I think Protoss is too weak vs mutas, but when I realized it has potential to change PvT so much, it might open a new tech tree for the Protoss, I am not sure the devs will be willing to change it in WoL even if they like the idea.

Ideas? Criticisms? If anyone feels its worth it I would appreciate if it can be copied in the USA battlenet forums so Blizzard devs can see it.",,False,self,t5_2tkqb,1349206282.0,,platinum,True,t3_10tuj6,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/10tuj6/suggestion_for_phoenix_make_graviton_beam_work/,

1365982836.0,9,self.allthingsprotoss,1ccsfp,Has anyone used/seen the mothership (full version) in HotS?,blindsc2,12,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/1ccsfp/has_anyone_usedseen_the_mothership_full_version/,"I don't know about anyone else, but I've never seen it used in HotS, nor see much reason to get it  at all. It's not that vortex shouldn't have been removed, but you get the feeling that something should have replaced it, other than time warp and the modified recall which the core has anyway, as well as photon overcharge. 

Some comparisons gathered from Liquipedia:

* DPS favours MS by about 66% at 0 upgrades on all sides, but by the time you would get MS, armour upgrades of the opponent should make it about equal without your own air attack upgrades. Range favours MS by 2, 7 to 5

* Speed favours MSC by ~0.47, and although I don't have the figures, I believe MSC has faster acceleration too 

* HP favours MS greatly with 350/350 compared to 130/60, and MS has an extra base armour point. MS also gains the massive unit trait 

* In terms of abilities, MS gains the cloaking field, but loses photon overcharge. MS can also attack air, while MSC cannot. 

* MS, assuming the core is already built and tech is available, costs 300/300, takes 100 seconds, and energy gathered by the core is lost, and must be started from 50 again. MS costs 8 total supply, MSC costs 2

&gt;So, for 300/300 and **6** extra supply in the late game, you essentially get cloaking field, greater durability,  and lose photon overcharge, and all else is broadly unimportant/minor given its purpose


While I don't claim for a second to have knowledge or experience in these situations, as far as I can work out this is the broad understanding/theory I have on the MS in various matchups:

**PvT**: I see absolutely no place for it here, almost never seen in WoL either, especially not in high level play. 

**PvP**: Potentially more uses now that void ray mid games are relatively common, thus the tech is often already there. But if so I imagine it's main use would basically be in the endgame as a 'hope his observers die mid battle' type thing, which shouldn't really happen. Considering it's massive trait, it would get one-shot by 9 tempests. In WoL it was sometimes used in endgames for vortex to gain positioning advantages in colossus wars, but vortex is gone and colossus wars are less common. 

**PvZ**: Here I think is the most likely place to see it (still, like in WoL). While this is totally unconfirmed theory-crafting, I think the cloaking field might have some use in the latest style of swarmhost/viper/staticdefence vs airtoss/templar split-map that we are seeing. Mostly against the locusts, it theoretically means that, until an actual engagement, the free locusts can be killed for free too. The mothership would stay WAYYY back so it doesn't get pulled. Tempests can be used to shoo away overseers and thus the cloaked templars can stay out front ready to feedback, unpestered by the locusts. Again, though, the supply cost is worth considering. As an aside, I was begging Artosis to get a Mothership to sit on his cannons in that 80 minute tempest/templar/cannon game he streamed


While I don't think ANY units should be changed for a long time, is the mothership a candidate for eventual change? IF it's true they aren't seen much, even into the distant future, is it a problem anyway? It took over a year for the archon toilet to be found and used semi-reliably, maybe other tactics will be found with it too. 

From a game design point of view, I think it's a good excuse to consider (again) a shield-battery type ability. I.E all units in an area centered on the mothership gain X shield life over the course of Y seconds. This would further it's position as the ultimate Protoss *support* unit. But, one can dream of Legacy of the Void, and something like this should be left for that really

I present to you a macro practice we used to do with friends long ago. 

**How it works:**

 * needed at least 3, ideally 4 people
 * 1v1 game, 2 observers
 * each observer follows 1 player and counts points
 * you get a point every time you break a rule
 * first to 10 points loses, regardless of how the game goes

**Rules:**

 1. can't bank more than 500minerals and 250gas per base 
 2. can't have idle worker longer than 15s 
      * 1 point per each worker and per each 15s
      * workers who are blocking in a wall or expansion, hidden somewhere/scouting or at tower don't count
 3. can't supply block yourself
 4. Expand before 5mins (zergs 3mins)
 5. have to attack, or at least harass before 10mins 
      * basically you just can't both sit back and only macro
 6. stored maximally 2 casts worth of energy for chrono/mule/larvae (per main building/queen)

**All the values and rules are from memory, so they might need adjustment to whats up today, or to your level of play

I personally think I made my biggest strides as a player when I started playing the obs map of the day maps. not only because it let me play people who were ""out of my league"" but because I was able to have meaningful discussion on HOW to think about something in observer mode.

Group replay watchign and our in-game group allows us to do exactly that, only tailored to a specific skill. For example a number of our members have been attempting to emulate PartinG and his won/won/won for so long that they never took in how to play Air pvz and feel especially crippled now that we're playing hots, losing to compositions people who've played air for a while... don't.

For Me: Assuming the ladder is evening out and I'm actually playing High-plat, low diamond again, I'm being crippled by my appalling PVP, and would love to get into a group discussion WHILE watching a high-level PvP replay that isn't overtly one sided... Like ALL the MLG Dallas PvP's were. Yes I think Seed COULD have beaten Rain game 1. Rain's stability and eventual access to more air made it pretty cut and dry for me. 

That being said I understand that a replay viewing discussion group would probably benefit more people faster if we started with basically a How to: Air, and depending on response continue from there.

First is the fact that mutas have faster movement speed and health regen. Question, why are they being buffed like this when it is already so hard for toss to deal with it? Mass phoenix doesn't seem like a good response considering how easy it is for them to be fungaled. Other things include making siege mode free. That makes terran attacks even more dangerous than they already are. What do you guys think? 

My main issue is that, overall, I feel as if Protoss got shafted in comparison to the other races. Mainly because  of things like the fact that the tempest is quite easy to kill if you mass anti-air (vikings or corruptors). Or that they keep eliminating useful abilities from the oracle and giving it to the mothership core, which is also easily sniped. From watching all these games, I feel as if Blizzard ignored some of the  fundamental issues regarding protoss - mainly a lack of flexibility in comparison to other races. PvZ seems to still be about either the late game or the 10 minute all in, PvT is about not dying in the early and mid game and then winning in the late game, PvP is this new wonky air-to-air stuff mixed with 1 base play and late game where each player has 5489057 colossi and motherships. Yea we have this new harrassment unit in the oracle, but you can't really use it in a straight up fight.

And this morning, while I was watching the games, I saw a unique playstyle from Parting which I have immediately tried and found incredibly successful to combat my recent woes of fighting infester-gglords.

Early mothership. Early mothership off two bases. Trying it out today it seems incredibly easy and practical. Start off with a stargate opening. Reveal the void ray. This immediately forces the zerg to cut drones, and build queens and spores to defend.

Over time, they begin to get more suspicious. Sending in overseers and changelings to try to understand why the only air unit they have seen is the one void ray. Meanwhile, you get your mothership out and take a third base.

I found in Plat the immediate reaction is hydralisk, and I have to assume more corruptors are used as you get higher up, but I don't see how a zerg stops this, even with incredibly good micro. You have two vortexes BEFORE brood lords can come out. And the zerg is so paranoid by the fact you haven't poked with anything but a void ray that they will be at their wits end when you reveal the mothership. Couple that with the fact that detection from zerg is beautifully easy to snipe with blink, and you have this phenomenally innovative strat I will now be using from now on.

If anyone has any flaws or anything they think can be improved upon, let me know.

Otherwise, check out Parting's games from this morning, they were beautiful! :D

I have questions :),Noddy1989,12,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/zhjdq/terran_here_looking_at_a_race_switch_i_have/,"Hey guys,  I'm your standard silver league Terran here looking at switching over to Protoss.

There's a few reasons behind wanting to do this switch, the primary one is my 3 favourite players all play Protoss (MC, Hero and Grubby) the second reason being I feel like Protoss have so much more to offer in terms of builds and variety over Terran such as fast teching and already in the few games I've played the satisfaction of getting nice FF's off,  a good storm, or microing the collosus back just that little bit to keep it alive feels so good.  

However whilst I believe I can follow a build order quite nicely I'm not 100% sure on how to transition further from that tech path.  The tutorials on how to play Protoss, whilst good, seem to be more reliant on using gateway units and immortals primarily to roll over the opponent pretty quickly.  This leaves the transition into higher tech a little unanswered in my opinion, and as we all know, even if you follow a BO perfectly you're not guaranteed a win there and then.  

So basically I have a lot of questions here about to come your way, and if anyone would be willing to answer that'd be much appreciated :)

1.  Should I be looking at taking my 3rd before teching to collosus?
2. What's the easiest way to FF?  I seem to F click, F click, F click.  I'm not sure if there's an easier way or not?  Same with Storms.
3. Should I be trying to use HT Energy up before morphing into an Archon? 
4.  When should I be looking at getting a Mothership out?  I've still yet to use one but I've never got to late game PvZ and I've never needed it in PvT yet.
5. Does anyone have any tips on blink micro?  I've been boxing the front few and blinking them back when they're low and constantly doing that.  Is there an easier way to do it?
6. What's the better upgrade.  Shields or Armor?  If I've got double forge I want to be doing Attack/Armor or Shield.  I'm slightly unsure which to chose to be honest.
7.  What's your go to BO in each matchup currently?  I don't want anything cheesy, and I'd prefer not to 4 gate but I don't quite understand what Protoss are doing on ladder currently versus Zerg and versus Protoss.  The professional Meta game is different to ladder imo, always will be.  


I'm sure I'll think of more questions soon.  I apologize if these questions seem pointless/nooby but they're questions I've thought of when playing and I think they're important enough.

I am a gold league terran with a friend who is just getting into starcraft. I feel like I have put him in the right mindset with the whole ""macro is key"" discussion, but he is really having trouble with how he should be spending his resources in the very early game. I know people keep saying that your build doesn't really matter in bronze league, but its still important to set up a basic groundwork in the first 8-10 minutes of the game.

So what I am looking for is a basic early expantion build that lets him get set up with all of the usual goodies at the right time. ie: a few warpgates and a robo facility or twighlight council.

Then, recall was taken away from the nexus and given to the mothership core. Im guessing they found nexus recall too powerful.

But I liked the idea of having to balance the nexus energy between chronoboost and something else, just like T has to balance between scan, mules and saving them from supply block. Z queens also have to decide to inject or place a tumor (although this is probably less dramtic than T choices). Maybe recall as a nexus hability was overpowered (specially with the core hability to re-engergize) but wouldnt it be great if the nexus still got some other energy hability so we had to balance where we spent our nexus energy? Because I feel at the end of the game the only thing I can do with the nexus energy is chronoboost gates, sometimes even if I dont really need it just because there is nothing else to do with the nexus energy.

My Terran friends have been working on their macro, macro, macro by straight-up massing marines, and it seems to be working very well for them.  Since there's no one unit for Protoss that is nearly as effective, I thought I'd spin off that idea by choosing one and only one opening for each matchup and working on my macro.

The goal here is to build up my mechanics, learn when to take a 3rd+ base (I almost always put it off or try to win off 2 bases because I have no idea when that should be) and 1-A to victory as far as my army goes.  No harassment, no bullshit, just straight-up macro wins until I'm at least plat.

Which openings/build orders should I learn?  I'm not opposed to 4gate for PvP, but I'd like as macro-oriented of a build as possible for the other two.

I've mostly been doing +2 Blink Stalker timings but it seems that a hefty spine wall can pretty much stop it all together while they turtle on 3 bases into Brood Lords. Even if I constantly deny 4/5th while I get my third up, once Brood/Infestor is out I can't do anything with Fungals on my Stalkers and Broodlords eating away at my army.

Transitioning to Colossi just leads to Corrupters who end up as more Broods later. Fungal out ranges Feedback and Archons can't even get through Broods. Stalkers get fungaled and eaten alive. SG gets pooped on by Corrupters. And if a Zerg dies to DTs they're just bad. I'm so lost. 

People say LOL GO MOTHERSHIP but between Neural and mass Corrupters, I'm really not sure what the point is. The Mothership seems unreliable and requires the Zerg to make a mistake to even get a good Vortex anyway.

Some basic analisys.. My worst matchup at the moment is my PvT since I just don't a build that fits me. I usually do the PartinG 2+ 2+ but get delayed against Terran quite some often. I feel like I kinda lose too often against widow mines with this build which delays me often since I get too scared and get too many canons out.. After on lose too pressure to MMM since I dont really have the army because I spend gas and minerals to get too my push, which I kind of think now is the wrong thing because I get really behind soo I kinda need to get out something safer
i.e colossus rather than trying to get archons since the splash on coloss is A LOT easier and I feel I can get out a 
3rd muccchh faster.. 


PvZ is atm my best matchup even though my stats dont say the same. I usually go mothership core open&gt; some
agression with 3 sentries and 2 zealots which is very safe and can makes me REALLY ahead.. Switch to dt's and make some damage when I later push out around 150 supply and kill the zerg with my 2+ 2+ (often delayed xD)
which often wins me the games since there are not really a lot they can do.


PvP I feel is ok. I think I need changes but it is not as bad as my PvT imo. Most the games I lose is to canon rushes and 2 gates, after all of this I tend to scout on 9 so I have a more clear view if I need to play safe or not.
I  usually open oracle and transition to a huge voidray production which often wins me games escpesially in the 
later stages of the game since I just split them and upgrade them (often). I feel very comfterable in the late game mixing archons zealots and voidrays since, Zealots tank and Archons splash. Main damage output is the voids which only get's countred if A: storms hit B: critical number of archons C: Get's an air advantage over me.

I'm a mid-masters Protoss on NA and I have a confession:  my PvT is abysmal.  Seriously, it's bad.  Recently, I started opening [Chargelot/Archon](http://imbabuilds.com/hots-protoss/hots-pvt/pvt-partings-2-2-chargelot-archon-timing/) with decent success (except vs really early Widow Mines) but it bothers me that I've always struggled with standard, Colossus-based openers.  I want to get back into a heavy Obs count style of play with both Blink and a higher Gateway-unit count than I think double-Forge allows.

I'm comfortable late-game (3-4 bases with both forms of splash - not super late like Tempests/Cruiser as I don't think many games at my level really go that late) but my deaths between 8:30-14:00 are pretty numerous.  My control isn't great in mid-game skirmishes so I'm more concerned with having enough stuff to be safe and less concerned with squeezing in +1 Attack.  I do know I should get the second Forge and the TC at 50% +1 Armor.

For the sake of discussion, let's assume Gateway unit production (which I'm almost positive is my problem when going for double-Forge/Colossus openers) isn't the problem.  If anyone could answer the following, it would be much appreciated.

1.  **When do you take the Forge?**  I want to 1-Gate expand with the general setup afterwards being three Gates, a Robo, and a Forge but I'm not sure what you can get away with in HotS.  For instance, is Gate &gt; Nexus &gt; Robo &gt; Forge &gt; 2x Gate too greedy?  Do I take the Forge before, at the same time as, at 50% Robo, etc.?

2.  **What does this do to your natural gas timings?**  Do you still require both in the late 6:00, early 7:00 range?  Can you take one earlier and delay the second?  If so, when?

3.  **How does this style work in HotS?**  Does the early-game safety of the MSC and generally later 3rd for Protoss make teching/upgrading more aggressively than this necessary?  I'm aware of the [Blink/Colossus](http://www.gamefront.com/state-on-starcraft-blink-stalkercolossus-pvt/) style but I think I would prefer the safety of earlier +1 Armor.

4.  **Are there any guides/streamers I can reference?**  Sorry, it's hard to get search results anywhere for anything other than double-Forge.  I'm pretty sure Artosis still plays like this but I'll have to double-check.

5.  **What the f@#% should my Gateway production be like through the midgame?**  This is sort of unrelated, but seriously, for years I've read contradictory information:  constantly make Gateway units, delay Gateway units for as long as possible, etc.  What should I do - favor constant production or tech in normal, 2-base vs 2-base situations?

I played a PvT earlier on Star Station and was wondering if anyone could help pick out things I should improve upon. I won the game, but I feel like I could have definitely played better.
I was going for kind of a rough DT expand, since I don't really have an exact build order for it. 
Here are a few things that I jotted down while I was reviewing the replay:

* I need to scout more
* I need to spend chronoboost more / chrono more probes
* My probe production is spotty consistency-wise
* I floated large amounts of minerals, that could have been spent on production facilities, other tech, or units.
* I need to pick better engagements and reinforce during battles
* My 16 pylon was a tad later than I wanted
* My Twilight Council could have gone down a tiny bit sooner
* I blindly expanded without scouting the Terran
* I need be more proactive with units, especially observers
* I could have taken my 4th earlier (and not in a stupid location)
* I need smarter forcefield placement (in addition to this, I don't think    I should have used many forcefields with a chargelot archon build)
* I could have teched to HTs earlier and used them with my army. 
* I need to improve my macro behind my harassment. 
* I could have used more proxy/forward pylons
* I could have used photon overcharge during an engagement at my third (I also could have been more active with my mothership core)

I'm sure I've overlooked some things. If anyone could check it out that would be great! Thanks in advance.

**TL;DR:** I won, but think I made blatant mistakes and could have played better overall.

I'm currently in Platinum. Yesterday, I was teetering between Plat/Diamond players and doing very well going like 15-5 (except maybe against Z), and I just finished today going 4-12, topping it off with a loss to a cannon-rushing gold player. 

I know that this sort of thing has been posted before, but I'm just not sure how to stay consistent. I'm getting to the point where I play 5-6 hours every day (because it's summer, and I don't have to take summer classes until June :p) and I can't make it into Diamond because of these slumps I keep having. I feel like my decision-making/mechanics stay the same. I've strayed away from only doing the imm-sentry all-in every time I play against Zerg, and I can't win that matchup to save my life anymore, though I'm starting to feel like I get the hang of it the more I play.

I'm trying to not just stick with these specific builds, because it'll hurt me worse when they simply stop working.

Can anyone tell me what they did to make the jump from Plat to Diamond? Bronze to silver was fairly easy once I started playing. Silver to Gold took about 3 weeks of playing an hour or two a day. Then HoTS came out, and I was pretty much instantly Plat and doing well.

I think part of the problem is I'm frustrated with the thought of feeling like I'm not making any progress. My goal is masters league, and it's just a little discouraging when I get into massive slumps.

If anyone has any tips, whether it be builds for every match-up, tips for my mentality, or tips in general, I'd greatly appreciate it. 

You guys are awesome. Thanks in advance!

There are two main issues that I have with this matchup:

1. I have a problem teching quickly because I'm always worried that I won't have enough units to hold off early aggression. I don't ever have this problem in PvP or PvZ, I just go for it and all is fine. But I'm always afraid for stimmed Terran units running up my ramp and obliterating everything before I can rally enough forces to hold. My scouting is fine, I make 2-3 obs, so I have plenty of time to react to drops and pushes. I just can't get out of the mindset that if I don't have massive amounts of units I'll lose to a timing push. 

Late game I'm fine. The tech is finished and I have charge, storm, colossus, etc. I just can't decide when to tech and when to make units. 

2. My second problem is related to the first one, which is how to engage and when to engage. Even after my tech is done, and I have AOE damage units, I always screw up my engagements. This, again, is because of the stimmed forces. I can't ever evaluate my army against theirs because despite the visual size of the armies, Terran can instantaneously increase his units' values and run over my army. 

So... I have problems with stim is what it comes down to. It makes me afraid to tech and either afraid to engage or I engage in a battle that I lose because of bad evaluation. Does anyone have any tips to overcome this fear?

It just seems that any time I see a protoss open with numerous colossi with range the terran has the option to plop down a second starport, make a few vikings, pull a ton of scvs, stim, amove and auto-win.

This has been somewhat evident in my own play as well. A lot of time I can defend that viking timing, because a lot of terrans at my level don't execute that well, but any time I play a good terran who executes that timing crisply and hits before I can have storm out I have a very hard time holding, and lose most games. This has led me to start going with 1 colossus without range straight into storm so I have a chance in hell of holding that timing. Though this is all just conjecture on my part.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE: Only choose three maps at most.  If you only veto two, that's cool, just choose two.  Any responses with four or more selections will be dismissed with extreme prejudice (I watched a lot of SVU last night.)  Please only take the poll once, I forgot to select the option to prevent you from doing it twice.  I will dismiss results after the first set from an IP address so please don't give me more work to do.

I am not super thrilled with this site and will probably pick a different one later (The data I get back is almost as bad as picking through search replies, and in the help docs it *says* I can restrict the number of selections, but that option is completely missing in practice).

*(edit: figured out how to generate reports, making the data a lot more manageable!)*

I am just going to leave the link here, since the season is almost over.  Next season I will post and put it over in the sidebar as well.  In this way, we'll be able to provide moderately accurate information without people having to create new threads every few weeks (just one thread per season instead!)

And I do not play enough or as much as I want.

Before I get on the excuse train, I already know my problem is cerebral. I can analyze my replays and pick one or two things that I couldve done that would've either won me the game or made it so I wasn't dead at 13 minutes, so I know I can simplify my problems. I watch about 100x more than I play, and I wish I played more. Every time I get the urge to log on, which is usually after a major tournament day and/or watching some excellent Protoss play like at WCS EU. But when it comes to logging on and hitting ""Find Match"" I hit a mental wall, sit there for about 5 minutes thinking of all the ways I could be cheesed, focusing on my past consistent mistakes and generally avoiding playing making excuses for myself, and I end up playing something else. I watch a lot of high level play, and a lot of high level analysis, and I've seen probably all of the helpful videos for P. Apollo's Protoss revamped series helped a lot, not because of build orders, but because of how calm he stayed the entire time. In game I don't have that calm confidence or the ""oh, shouldve scouted. Next game though.."" feeling when I lose. In game, I panic from about the 6-12 minute mark and regardless of what has happened, I feel behind even if I'm a mile ahead.

I really feel like because I understand so much of how to play Protoss on a high level, I get disappointed that I can't do it. Instead of focusing on the major problems that are keeping me at the silver/gold level, I'm trying and failing at playing at the diamond/masters level. What's even worse to me, is I have a slightly winning record in HotS at 52%, and it could be a lot higher if I was even a little better at PvZ my worst match up.

Anyway: to me it feels kind of like rock paper scissors, so I'm looking for tips.

In my experience the most common openers are stargate-oracle, stargate-phoenix and dt rush.

Phoenix beat oracle, oracle beats dts (if you spot it early enough and get your oracle back in time to detect) and dt beats phoenix. (hence rock paper scissors)

I think my biggest problem is that I have a hard time discerning the different builds based on scouting; gas timings seem all over the place and the first stalker shuts down most chances of getting a probe in to spot the twilight council or stargate.

I generally favour marco play, so I usually try to go gate cyber stargate 1 or 2 more gates and expand. But then I die either to mass phoenix (if I decide to go oracle, or just because I invested in expands and not in phoenix) or to dts (dangit, I always miss that crucial forcefield on the ramp!).

Sometimes timings feel kind of random to me, too. I once went oracle first and just wanted to expand. I waited a while, untill I thought: 'well, the dt timing has come and gone now, if he was going dt's he'd be here now' so I expanded and tried a bit of poking with my oracle. When it was across the map, 3 dts showed up and I totally lost.

So there has been a slight change in the ways that the coaches are determined, If you wish to coach, please edit the tile on the spreadsheet that corresponds with the player that you wish to coach.

We will start coaching after the tournament this weekend, which doesn't have anyone to cast/organize as I will be doing Ludum Dare and be out of town (for the jam) but if you want to do it message me... So it will be a replay tourney unfortunately...

After the tourney we want coaches to pick and message their players so they can start on coaching immediately.

The tournament bracket will be released on Friday and will take place on Saturday, I will try to moderate as best as possible.

Questions or Concerns? Message me here on reddit or on Skype under blazingkin.

I looked up a couple of build-orders for specific match up's and set about learning them (1 each) but even if I follow it perfectly I seem to get to the around the 10 minute mark in every game where I have two full saturated bases but only a zealot or two out in the field. 

It's around this time that the enemy comes around and just steam-rolls over me.

So basically, it seems like for 300/300 and sacrifice of photon overcharge and detection you get a slower, beefier, cloaking ship that does an extra stalker worth of damage to ground and 16.3(+2.7) to air. Vortex is now unbelievably useless, except to BM vortex a ling or something right before you gg. I'm curious whether anyone is justifying ever actually getting one, and why?

I'm a brand new player. I bought SC2 on a whim like two weeks ago and have been having a blast so far, learning the ropes and playing 2v2s with my buddy. Since a new season started, I decided to get out of my comfort zone and try some 1v1.

And then I realised I'm bloody terrible. There's this one opening I kind of half-assedly copy every game, and if shit hits the fan, then I just try to wing it, and that rarely works out in my favour. 

So here I am, with a plea for help. I submit for your consideration my last four games. If anyone could be bothered to watch them and maybe point out what could I have done better, or what should I work on, I'd be really, really grateful. 

[Game 1 - PvP CANNON RUSH NOO (loss)](http://drop.sc/290629)

This game made my blood boil for a while. I failed to scout a cannon rush in my natural, and by the time I noticed an early forge in his main it was too late to do anything (I guess?). Had no idea how to break contain early, so I tech'd all the way to colossus, broke out, pushed into his base... And then suddenly void rays. Apart from scouting better, what could I have done to win this?

[Game 2 - PvT Marine + Marauder party in my base](http://drop.sc/290631)

Now this guy took me completely by surprise. I just had no idea what to do, and he wiped me out in 8 bloody minutes. How do I counter a rush like this? 

[Game 3 - PvP win](http://drop.sc/290632)

[Game 4 - PvT win](http://drop.sc/290630)

In these two games I feel like I did OK, but I kind of feel like I could've won much earlier. Dunno how, though.

Again, any help would be greatly appreciated.

I was on my laptop all weekend and realized this is where I played my very first ladder games of SC2.

It was a cold day, and the nerd Ferrite was nervous to hit the 1v1 button for the first time ever.  He had practiced the 3-gate sentry expand with his buddy about 20 times now and it was time to test it out.

In his way was a Terran named Julker.

I wanted to link this as motivation hopefully.  I started with 20 apm and no idea what a RTS was.  With a little help from my friends at the time, and some determination of my own I was able to get from never playing an RTS to Platnium in one season.  From there it took me 2 seasons to get to Masters… 

Anything is possible. Go for it.

I've been offracing a lot since last year, but have only done so casually and out of appreciation for SC2 as a whole.  I was hoping that more experienced diamond/master league Protoss players on ATP would be willing to provide some insightful generic timings they've discovered through their play.

My girlfriend decided to learn how to play Starcraft 2 and chose toss and all of a sudden my Protoss experimentation took on new significance.  Aside from being preferable to playing those dirty Terran, I am now motivated to become better at my toss play so I can help her more.  She's finally at the point where I don't have much to teach her about Toss anymore without being more knowledgeable about the race than I am at the moment.

SO, here's some timings I already know, to provide examples for the sort of knowledge I'm hoping you guys have to offer:

Zealot/Core timing - If you start a zealot less than 10 seconds after beginning your cyber core, the Zealot will pop in time to begin a stalker immediately.

Gateway / Warpgate timing - For a gateway to finish constructing in time for Warpgate Research to finish, you must begin it at ~50% Warpgate or before (No chrono)

Gateway / Unit / Warpgate timing - For a gateway to finish constructing in time to build 1 unit out of it before Warpgate finishes, you must begin construction at ~30% warpgate or earlier depending on stalker/zealot/sentry

Fast mothership core timing - To afford warpgate and momma core as soon as your cybercore pops, pylon on 16 and double gas when your gateway is about 75% complete - and only begin 3rd chrono on Nexus AFTER starting the cyber core.

Does anyone else have some good general timings to share?  Not looking for a full-blown build - I'm trying to acquire more of the building blocks/puzzle pieces for efficient play.

Some things I'm interested in - Stargate timings, gas timings, upgrade timings, fast pressure timings (not all-in), and any good timings that might involve the first 10 minutes of play!   I'm also interested in unique expand timings anywhere from nexus first to MC's gate expand with 2 stalkers, 1 zealot, and a nexus at 30 supply.  I have been trying to teach her gateway heavy/high unit count playstyles, with a bigger focus on macro and +ups over the smaller army/tech-heavy play that is very standard for most toss these days.  We also both hate the colossus, either using them or fighting them.

Please read this message in the entirety, ask questions if you are confused, and enjoy! We love running these tournaments, but to do them successfully we need you to comply with the rules, show up to the tournament on time, and we need you to pay attention. It's looking like we'll have over 60 players in 5 divisions going roughly around the same time. Confusion is likely. To help with this, in the next few days private groups will be setup for each division. And information will be posted on www.heartlandstarcraft.com Please stay tuned!

**Also add Sick.747 in SC2 (NA Server) if you haven't already. This will allow me to invite you to groups and chat with you if necessary.**

Hello everyone, if you're getting this message you are one of two people:

1) Participating in the Heartland Hitmen's May Flowers Open Tournament.
2) Helping out with the tournament in some way.

Or I guess both. The sign-ups are nearly complete. We're rather close to the cut-off in several divisions (16), and from this point on, if someone signs up in those particular divisions, they will be placed on a waiting list or something similar. 

Rules:

1) You might not get placed in the division you requested. We will be producing and making brackets on Thursday May 9th. We will base your seeding and brackets based on your current ladder and career 1v1 ladder status as of that day. Ex. If you've been in Plat before and now currently Gold, and you requested Gold division, you may get placed into Platinum.

2) Each round is a best of three. The opening round will be opened on Bel'Shir Vestige LE, the second round Klontas Mire TE, and third round Zerus Prime TE. After the first game the previous game's loser gets map choice for the following game. After the third round, the higher seed (or for the loser's bracket, the player who advanced further in the winners bracket) gets first choice.

3) Map pool: You may only choose these maps. 
Akilon Wastes (2)
Bel’Shir Vestige LE (2)
Klontas Mire TE (2)
Neo Planet S LE (2)
Derelict Watcher TE (2)
Zerus Prime TE (4)
Star Station (4)
Whirlwind LE (4)

4) Replays: You must submit your replays after your games are finished to one of two locations. Directly to a submission thread on our forums which will be distributed before the tournament begins, or email them directly to heartlandhitmen@gmail.com

5) If you're late to your match in any round, after 15 minutes you forfeit your first game, and after 30 minutes you forfeit the round.

6) Failure to comply with these rules, will result consequences related to future events. oHHo organizers are allowed to use their best judgement. 

7) Please share news of this event with your friends, family and otherwise. We put a lot of work into organizing this, we truly appreciate the exposure you can help bring us! &lt;3

Schedule:  To help organizers get things started, we're staggering the bracket start times. This is to help keep things going. Each round can be assumed to start 1 hour after the previous round. But can be started sooner if necessary. Thus you can assume, that the tournament will last 7 to 8 hours after the tournament begins. Be aware of this!

Division Schedule:
12pm (CDT) - Bronze/Silver &amp; Masters
1pm (CDT) - Diamond
2pm (CDT) - Platinum
3pm (CDT) - Gold

This message is your check-in message. To HOLD your spot in the tournament you will need to reply to this message with your solemn promise to show up on time. Your response should look like this.

Please respond: 

Yes I will show up 15 minutes before my scheduled game time. I know the tournament is being run on Central Daylight Time. I know what CDT is compared to my time, and I know where to go (in SC2 in the clan chat). I understand the rules of the tournament, I know that it is a double elimination tournament, I will be ready and able for all of my matches on Saturday win, lose or get out.

Pretty easy.

Some alternate responses could include, I will be late, I will not be available let someone take my spot, I'm not playing, but I'll be there to help out, etc.

advantages?

Opened up in a PvZ planning on doing a FFE on a 2-player map, but scouted a 2nd hatch with no pool (14-15-ish I guess. I don't know Z BO's at all). Decided to cannon harass as the hatch was finishing. Z didn't have time to cancel, I ended up putting 4 cannons and 2 pylons at the natural choke point, close enough to have the hatch in range. Busted out with a bunch of lings and then he tried to go roach/ling after a failed ling run by.  
  
1) Is this best reaction to punish this greedy play? Other than being called ""a homo"" by the Z player, felt good and it put me ahead quite a bit.  
2) I expanded, and then I attacked around 15:00-ish while trying to saturate the expansion.

http://drop.sc/322544

Here is a replay of a masters game in which is one of the optimal ways of defending. 

In a PvP 2 player map cheese is extremely likely. Keep your gateway relatively close to your nexus and scout on 13. Scouting on 9 is overkill because it gives him time to react if only his pylon is down and he can transition out of it (maybe), and 2, you lose needed minerals if hes still going for it.

My method for scouting is Scout on 13 outside your base with your gateway probe (like i did), and scout inside your base when you put down your 2nd pylon. Your game really wont change that much to the point where you need to scout IN your base with your gateway probe. 

You'll notice that when i scout the 2 gate I don't do anything drastic like throw down a forge, or throw down another gate to try and combat with it. Throwing down a 2nd gate is one of the worst things you can do. It brings you closer to his tech and gives him a chance to come back. Just chrono out a zealot and get ready to pull your probes when he comes in. The mistake I made was putting my 2nd pylon too far out. It's not really a big deal especially because it's only a bad thing when he's cheesing you with 2 gate, but as you saw he almost picked it off. 

The 2nd pylon there can also be good because it forces him to make a decision. Do i finish the pylon and take a lot of damage or do i run back? But as you soon saw when i got the surround even though i lost a bunch of workers, i knew i was still ahead on both workers and tech so I was fine. If you can, try to micro a little bit but if you can't don't sweat it you'll be fine. 


**Bottom Line**
The most important thing to remember about defending a 2 gate is to not panic, keep working towards a cyber core and stalkers to kite him, and when the time comes when he attacks before your stalker is out (which it will), pull atleast 10 probes and attack with your zealot(s) and probes. 

This guy knew it was over when i stopped it but if your opponent doesn't leave after the ordeal, simply work towards a 4 gate and kill his  2 proxies and play the game from there.",,False,self,t5_2tkqb,False,,,True,t3_1c7shj,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/1c7shj/how_to_properly_defend_a_2_gate_proxy_pvp/,

I've played a few games now where the Zerg will go for a purely Hydra/Swarm Host composition accompanied by a ton of Overseers to snipe observers.

I've tried a few different things to combat this and I've not really found anything to be too effective. They just keep sending wave after wave of stuff to dwindle your army down.

I've tried going mass Colossus and stutter-stepping back (with Thermal Lance) to pick off the locusts before they can fire, but by the time you kill them off, the next wave spawns.

I've tired HT with storm, which seems to be pretty effective as well, but once you get up to the hydras you kind of have nothing to tank other than some chargelots (which don't fare too well)

I've tried Voids and chargelots but then there's no good way of dealing with the locusts so the chargelots melt and the hydras have free reign over the Voids.

I'm kind of at a loss here. Most of the games where this happens it's when I'm trying to take a third, and they just pressure it with wave after wave of locusts until I have to sacrifice it. Then they'll usually take another base while I'm stuck on 2, just biding time to get something out.

It was something like that in HotS beta and has always been like that in WoL.

I don't want to believe that zerg just generally dominates protoss at that level, so let's rule balance out. I also don't think this is because of my strategies, as my PvT is purely reactionary. Also, I've tried almost any style out there in PvZ - from one base all-ins to fast 3 base, from double stargate into mass cannons carriers templar(which actually worked decently) to sentry immortal all-ins.

No matter my strats, I just play bad vs zerg. And I'm pretty sure it's a mindset thing. On the other hand, against terran(even in hots) everything seems easy - i just make units, scout, react, defend their multipronged agression until i'm either forced to all in(terran snipes too much of my econ) or when i'm maxed. Easy. I wish my PvZ would be like this one day. Right now I'm not sure how this could be achieved.

SPOILERS

...and watching MC's sick PvZ games. I was super impressed by his 2nd game against Curious (vod if you have GSL http://www.gomtv.net/2013gsls1/vod/71474). I think going skytoss in the very late game vs. zerg is pretty standard, but the way that MC did it looked so much stronger than any other protoss I have seen. I was watching Minigun's stream last night and he was having tons of trouble breaking spore/spine lines with skytoss against Scarlett. I know that MC is on a different level than Minigun, but that same problem I have seen in a lot of pro games, and my in own play.

Anyway here somethings that MC did that I think made him so effective:

* Traded his ground army well. He split it into two groups, one of pure blink stalker and another one with  a few stalkers and immortals. He was able to snipe the spire and greater spire, as well as a base of the zerg. This is pretty nice damage but also bought him time because if you get caught in the middle of sky transition it can be GG. I think the timing when he decided to trade was pretty perfect, and he did it all at once to maximize damage instead of slowly doing it with small groups that do no damage

* He also went voidray before carrier while getting his air upgrades, and tried to keep them hidden. He stopped at like 12 voidrays before starting carriers. I think this helps with the vulnerability issues because carriers take so long to build. If the zerg attacks and doesnt know about the voidrays you can end of killing all the broodlords. The higher voidray count is a stronger fighting force than more carriers if you can keep them from getting fungaled. He used the carriers more as tanks and zoning than dps. When I see protosses go more carrier heavy they struggle to break spore lines and loss a lot of money intercepters especially when they get fungaled.

* Focus on high templar over archons and colossus. He got a crazy amount of high templar which allowed him to feedback infestors, zone with storms and blanket storms on top of everything in a fight. Archons are only helpful if they can get into a vortex, and when attacking into the zerg with spines and infestors in position they usually get stuck and can't make it in. Colossus are nice for zoning infestors but are also countered by corrupters and provide no help in anti-air.

* Don't move out until double vortex, this allowed his mothership to stay super safe against any corruptor dives and made the zerg more cautious when engaging

This is just what I got from watching the VOD, would love to get my hands on a replay.

The usual options I consider are blink obs, 6 gate or 2 base colossus, but none of them seem that strong and/or have glaring weaknesses. Blink obs is pretty strong if the terran is under-prepared, but it seems like every terran I run into just assumes that's what I'll be doing when they see the fast second gas, and is already prepared with a bunker in the main and a bunch of marauders on the way. 6 gate has seemed the strongest to me over all, but against a good terran it seems to get shut down cold if they make 3 bunkers and/or have good enough map awareness to sniff it out before I hit. 2 base colossus is pretty strong on paper, but if the terran simply drops 1-2 medivacs behind your mineral line right after you move out it seems completely unwinnable.

I'm playing in HotS due to being in the AHGL as Mozilla's captain. I'm finding that if I don't harass (generally with oracle or prism play) I get left behind when playing against the higher leagues (I'm WoL Silver, HotS Bronze) my problem with doing harass though is that my macro slips.

I can see 2 primary reasons for this, first I am a terribly slow player, generally have lower APM than most other players, even ones I beat. Second, while I can keep up my probe and upgrade production I have a hard time context switching enough to hit my warp gate key, camera key back to my base, warp things, then jump back to my harassment without pretty much always losing my harassing units.

Likely any tips for doing this will be 'just keep doing it until you are good at it' but I was wondering if anyone who worked out being able to do this had any insights that might help.

Another thing, is generally using casters. I can get used to using a single type of caster in a fight (sentry or HT or oracle) but never multiple. I forget to setup the hotkeys and even when I do remember, I have a hard time actually using the right spells at the right time. Any insight are welcome or perhaps suggestions of some good training maps for HotS for this.

Background: I've been a Protoss player for a long time now and when I was finally making good progress in WoL I was forced to switch to HotS if I wanted to play in this league which has been more jarring than I'd like. Much more harass play (that I have to do and react to) as well as learning how to counter the new units as I can't just watch some streams and see how it all works.

PS: If anyone knows any coaches that have been playing HotS and are reasonably priced for my skill level ($20-40 USD/h) I'd be interested in talking to them.

tl;dr: Casters are hard and so is multitasking.",,False,self,t5_2tkqb,False,,silver,True,t3_14xq8r,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/14xq8r/harassment_and_casters/,

I can't ever seem to win any more unless the other player is just really bad.  I've tried going ht first which is what i prefer but that just goes really bad so I've been trying to go colossus first which has worked out better but I still can't win.

Here's a replay of a recent game.  It just feels like terran are constantly trying to base race me, as soon as I move out they attack my production.  I know in this game there were a couple of times where i let me colossus get out of position and they got sniped (still getting used to colossus play again since I haven't really used them as a staple of my army in a long time).  Even with those losses though I feel I still should have won the game, but instead the terran just waited for me to move out far enough and attacked my base, then in the end my ht were too far behind my army which killed me.  Just not sure though what the hell i'm doing wrong in general against terran.

Team OpTiK is recruiting (if you didn't notice in /r/starcraft[1] ) and we desperately need Terran and Protoss players. Right now our roster is being swarmed with Zerg and is a causing an imbalance in our roster.

What I did was change my control groups to:
`, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, tab key and q. And instead of tabbing through units, I use the mouse buttons

But I still found myself moving my whole army into the fight with one hotkey, but at least moving the spell casters away from this so that I could get off some decent storms or force fields etc, and wouldn't have to tab through my army.

Back mouse button) all nexus' (0)

Forward mouse button) robo(8) or stargate

filtersc uses an entirely macro centric play for both races. He uses 2 base mass barracks and marines for Terran, and he uses 2 base mass roaches for Zerg.

In all the series for Bronze level, he has several rules to simplify lessons for newbies (no scouting, no tech, no third, no micro) and some macro benchmarks (like x workers at x:xx. Expansion at y:yy, etc.).

Since he doesn't have one for Protoss. I decided to just adopt the idea over the Protoss: i.e. pick either a Tier 1 unit (Zealot) or Tier 1.5 unit (Stalkers) and mass those while taking 2 base with constant focus on supply awareness and probe production.

Here are some replays of my attempts in zip files via [mediafire.](http://www.mediafire.com/?16vzlcmnumeephh) I don't know if these will not necessary to view or helpful at all. But thought it was kind of a given that when asking for help that I provide replays.

When playing Terran and Zerg doing macro play, it works great. I've been winning more than losing (17-5). 

But with Protoss, it's not working, and I would like some help.

I'm suspecting several things:

* Higher cost per unit of Protoss is making it difficult for me to just literally adopt Terran or Zerg macro benchmarks.
* Maybe this macro play is not possible to begin with, when using zealots only.
* My sense of macro is horrible, so without rigid structure and hand holding, I cannot perform a play successfully.
* Protoss as a race is hard to try and pull off a strictly macro play.
* Macro play for either zealots only or stalkers only or both would've worked if I stayed on top of macro more.",,False,self,t5_2tkqb,False,,,True,t3_yon9o,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/comments/yon9o/filtersc_style_macro_play_attempt_with_protoss/,
