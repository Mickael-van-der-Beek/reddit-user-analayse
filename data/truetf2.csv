In honor of you guys getting this topic here, I emailed the TF2 team with the thread's URL, and a quick overview of everything and the suggestions.  If I hear back from the cast, I'll post it here.

A little food for thought truetf2ers, would you play a prearranged game mode like 6v6/9v9 through the tf2 client?

Things to consider:

* Team and solo queueing
* Potential ranked/ratings for players
* Spontaneous tournaments by valve
* Potential spectating comp games easily
* Get such a beautiful comp scene some more spotlight
* Lowers the barrier to entry into comp, and can be more moderated than the less-than-kind tf2lobby

Suggestions:


mrsnakers: **GAMBLING**

* Spectate matches/tournaments
* Bet scrap metal on a team/player/etc
* Watch through a valve-implemented spectator system

klingon13524: **Requirements to enter**

* Completed training for class
* 25 Hours/1 milestone achievement for the class
* At time of implementation, all players in a league would achieve 'captain' status + a captain hat that tracks wins in queue.  Both teams require a captain as they are randomly assembled
* New captains to be voted in by peers/wins/experience

ringl-bells: **Mics only**

* Checkbox to filter for mic-only games.


ObscuredBy: **Queue Systems**

* Options:
* 1: Pick class, any friends to play with, map type -&gt; server pairs with remaining players/classes and starts game.
* 2: System similar to tf2Lobby, find a map to play on, enter lobby + pick class to play of remaining classes.


BolKaka: **Bans/formats**

* Template of items/classes
* Individuals can fill out templates and submit
* Public(or some sort of higher authority) vote on lists formats
* Voted in formats become options for players/random queues to use

**Why the hell is this even a comparison?**


When people think of comp TF2 and the scout, the Soda Popper is usually the last thing on peoples'. In fact, had it not been for my poor frag video at times featuring the wonderful [Jump4r](http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLF6C27935F8EF6BA7&amp;v=ulIXg3utY7g&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=223s), most people wouldn't have even assumed anyone actually uses it. In fact, after that video was released, I had more people asking me about why our scout seemingly always ran the Soda Popper  when ""the vanilla scattergun is the best"" than I did about anything else. So why does he use it? Well, Jump4r is odd. If he's not using the SP, he's using the FaN, and I'd imagine he'd use the Shortstop before the regular Scattergun because we think he's slightly retarded. All that aside, I crunched some numbers for you guys because I'm sick and tired of people thinking it's a shit weapon when people use it in lobbies or pug.nahl. Get ready for some math.

**The Graph**
***
Because not everyone likes seeing the raw numbers, I made a quick excel graph showing the Scattergun's damage over time compared to the Soda Popper with and without mini-crits (shown for two full clips of the SG, or 12 shots).

[Behold](http://i.imgur.com/KSVeA.png?1)

**Assumptions**
***
If you're still reading this, you're probably like ""what's this mean?"" Well, I'm learn you somethin real quick like. There are several important things to look at and remember when looking at this graph; along with two important assumptions for the purpose of an accurate comparison. The first is assuming that both weapons are hitting for their maximum damage (105 and 142 respectively) and not missing. The chances of you hitting everyone of your shots at ramp-up range is slim to none. You're going to miss shots, you're going to be dodging around, and you won't be right up in that Solly's grill for more than 3 seconds (unless you're both doing something wrong). This actually brings up another advantage of the SP that we'll discuss later in that *mini-crits don't take fall off damage*. You'll be able to pop the medic for ""mini-crit meat shots (around 120)"" from a distance where the SG would only be able to do about 60-70. But again, we'll talk about how broken that is later.

The second assumption I'll be making is that you have mini-crits. If you want to talk about the SG vs the non MC SP that's fine, but I'm not interested in that. Anyone who's used the SP for more than 30 seconds is fully aware how fucking ridiculously easy it is to seemingly *always* have mini-crits. Even if you *don't* store them (and just run around using the SP) you'll have mini-crits roughly 40% of the time. It takes you a wee bit under 13 seconds to charge up your hype and you get that hype for a full 8 seconds (so yes, the last shot on the graph for the MC SP is technically incorrect). Balanced, right? 

**Analysis**
***
Now for the fun part. What you'll notice right off the bat is that the Soda Popper can 2 shot *every class in under a 3 third of a second* except for a fully buffed soldier or heavy/buffed heavy. That's a HUGE advantage over the stock scattergun. However, the Scattergun actually beats the SP in the ""race to 300"" (an important number, as that is non-buffed heavy and a fully buffed Solly). So when taking on those two classes the scattergun theoretically is a better weapon. But what if the Heavy is buffed? If he's sitting at 450, or anything above 426, the stock Scout is in trouble. The SG not only shoots that critical kill shot at a slower rate than the SP, *it has to fire an entire extra round*. The SG will take down a fully buffed heavy in 2.5 seconds in 5 shots. The SP will take down the Heavy in *1.86 seconds* (nearly a second quicker) *with only 4 shots*. Anyone who's danced around a heavy knows that a second can make the difference between life and death. So the Soda Popper has an advantage in terms of firing speed for the second and fourth shot, and disadvantage on the third, fifth, and sixth shot (and obviously anything after that it's a complete blowout that's not even worth discussing). But when you look at possible damage output, it's not even close. By the fourth shot the SP is so far ahead of the SG it's ridiculous. The SG puts out 420 damage while the SP puts out nearly 570 *in less time*.

**Applicability/Conclusion**
***
This is all assuming perfection of course. Perfection is, obviously, borderline unattainable. So what happens when you think about the SG and the SP with the human element added in? Depends on how you want to look at it. One of the most underrated benefits of the SP's mini-crits is the lack of fall off damage. With no random spread on, it's very possible to one shot scouts at a distance where they can only do 70-80 to you. This also means you can still 2 shot the medic as the pyro airblasts you away into a rocket that sends you flying. Play around with it. *You'll be disgusted with the range the SP can still do 75 at*. The pistol also gets mini-crit boosted, and being able to shoot out ~20 damage a pop from any range is an unbelievably beneficial effect. Hit the med for 120 as you fly around from spam? Fuck waiting to reload. Hit q, switch to your pistol, and spray fire from wherever the hell you are. That's the reason *I* love the SP. I'm not the greatest scout. My aim isn't perfect, and my movement is far from ideal. And jumping into the combo in HL as a scout means you're going to get screwed up. The moment you jump in the pyro, heavy, demo, solly, and god knows what else that came back for heals is going to be aiming at your frail, 125 hp body. With the SP all you really need to do is line up *one shot* and hold M1 (because .315 seconds is pretty damn quick). Bam. Med down. 2 points. Go team. Respawn, get dem cap points, and you're already top fragging. Any by the 9th shot, the SP has already put out more damage than 2 entire clips of the SG would have. You'll also always have mini-crits ready for mid (except koth_waste...I believe that's the only one where you won't have fully hype). Even at freaking Gullywash. Their demo better hope he picked up the big health pack because you're about to two shot him at a range that will get you a guaranteed ""wow, that weapons shit"" in your chat.

That being said, there are dowsides. Specifically, the ""inbetween"" time of 4th shot and the 7 shot when fighting another scout. Assuming all things equal, the SP is better for scout on scout fights. But things aren't always equal. The SP gives you the advantage of being able to 1 shot an opposing scout at any given time. But if you haven't killed that scout by your 4th shot you're actually at a disadvantage until his clip runs out. Also, that 3rd shot disadvantage *kills* with mini-sentries. They usually take 3 shots to kill, and sweet mother of god does that reload seem like it takes forever when it's just picking you apart.

So what do you guys think? Anyone else find these numbers as interesting as I do? Or is change too scary? What other benefits/weaknesses (I know there are some of those) have I missed? 

**FaN?**
***
For those of you who are interested in the FaN and it's actual application in HL and more-6's, I'm so unqualified to discuss it it's not even funny. But if you are, the FaN-god known as [Thief](http://www.youtube.com/user/DaBridgeTroll) has two incredible FaN videos (shown [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFCorzv1dUE&amp;feature=plcp) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ELtvuffvY&amp;feature=plcp))The FaN should be left to trained professionals only.

My buddy and I are developing a new tf2 matchmaking site, similar to the well known tf2lobby. 

After playing a decent amount of lobbies, we grew tired of the buggy and slow site, and decided to make our own.

The new site will be called tf2center, and will focus on the same as tf2lobby, but also feature tournaments, and a decent ranking system, so you can play with people with around your exact skill level.

Prizes will also be featured, for winning a tournament. You can get a random matchmaked team tournament, or an already set-up team tournament. We could charge an entree fee of 1 Reclaimed metal per team, and the winners would win a few refined!

We will also have a bunch of stock gameservers, so anyone can create a lobby without needing to have a server of their own. A better reporting system will also be applied.

My question is, if this idea seems interesting to you, or if the regular tf2lobby.com is good enough, paired with the normal tf2 tournaments?

It took only about 48 hours, which was certainly a feat for 5 Gs. I love our community! Here's a little comment from team member Aporia,

&gt;After only a little more than 48 hours we've hit our goal. The overwhelming amount of support from you guys and the global community is truly staggering. On behalf of everyone I'd like to extend a very humble thank you to everyone that has donated so far, shown their support on the forums, or even wished us all the best in this endeavour.

&gt;With 38 days to go we have a lot more time than we were expecting to push for our stretch goals - so keep your eyes peeled for some exciting developments in the near future!

&gt;Your support means the world to us - and at this rate I'm a bit worried that I'll have to find at least one positive aspect of snakewater to talk about!

I for one am really excited to see what they can pull off at lan against the best of the best from the other scenes. Like I said before, it's a bit of a tossup whether they will be able place well in the tournament. They could either smash their way to the finals, or find themselves lagging way behind the rest because of the isolated community here.

1347530041.0,130,self.truetf2,ztd2i,Obscure pyro (and other class) tips and tricks.,Kodix,155,25,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/ztd2i/obscure_pyro_and_other_class_tips_and_tricks/,"So, I've been playing for years, consuming countless hours of TF content, and generally being immersed almost as much as I can, but I find that there's such a small amount of info on some things out there that I still managed to miss them entirely for a time. This is a thread with that in mind - what tactics, tricks and tips do you think are rarely mentioned and rarely seen? 

To begin with, here's a few I learned relatively recently or rarely see mentioned.

- [Megadanxzero](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/znb88/what_item_do_you_think_is_severely_underrated/c664uq6) recently brought to my attention that you can maximize your DPS when axtinguishing heavies by going axtinguish -&gt; secondary -&gt; axtinguish, with none or nearly no loss of time in-between axtinguishes. I have *never* seen this used before in any pyro PoV or stream or demo. If executed well, this'll kill an overhealed heavy in two axtinguishes.

- Airblasting while clipping or touching teammates leads to weird projectile/rocket behavior, where the rocket will either fly off in a random direction or just straight into you. Avoid if at all possible - whether you're a pyro or another class, keep this in mind.

- You can remove both weapon graphics *and* your own flamethrower flames by using viewmodel_fov 0 instead of r_drawviewmodel 0. Immensely, immensely useful when going up against soldiers and such.

- ""Groundstalling"" exists. When you airblast someone from a higher elevation than them, you lock down their movement for a moment. I've seen this used in interesting ways, such as puff -&gt; groundstall -&gt; sting. 

- More importantly, being groundstalled also makes you count as ""in air"" for the purposes of reserve shooter minicrits until you jump yourself. This is a bug that should really be fixed by now, but when you know about it, you can avoid it fairly easily.

- If you want to learn arrow reflect timing and animations by heart, you can do it with bots using the itemtest command. Unlike most weapons replaced using that command, huntsman is not just cosmetic.

- The default viewmodel fov flames are very misleading. tf_debug_flamethrower 1 (which requires sv_cheats 1) will show you how the hitboxes for the flamethrower actually look, and allow you to get a good feel for aiming it. Alternatively, the flamethrower flames in viewmodel_fov 80 (which doesn't require sv_cheats) are nearly perfectly aligned with the hitboxes, and you can use those for getting a feel for the aim as well. 

- As a spy, if you backstab an airborne (say, jumping or falling) ubered person, they will be launched into the air. That's right, you can sometimes deny - or slow - ubers as a spy.

- When training offline, use net_fakelag and net_fakejitter commands to simulate online environments. It's not perfect, but it can be very helpful in getting an *actual* idea of your capabilities in a match - I thought I could reflect much closer rockets than I really could until I tried this.

Obviously, a good portion of you will consider these obvious and trivial, but I think that they are mentioned rarely enough to deserve a place here.

I'd also add ones for other classes.. if I had any interesting ones.

I feel like Dr. Seuss :3c I just want to shed some light on how Soldier vs. Pyro actually goes down. I've seen questions about rocket reflecting on this subreddit and around other TF2 communities, and I though if anyone would appreciate this insight it would be truetf2!

On to business: The short version of this message is that even though on paper The Pyro can reflect at the same rate as a Soldier fires rockets, it doesn't mean that Pyros can reflect every single rocket. 

Before I continue, I want to stress that we're talking about two players who aren't trying to predict each other. If you make a mistake predicting when your opponent is going to block or fire, then you're going to take damage no matter what. 

After clearing that up, let's get on to the fun part of the theory: 'Why can't you reflect every rocket? Tasko you're full of shit, I've reflected every rocket before!' And if you're a decent pyro, hopefully that's true. However, **when a Soldier and Pyro move towards each other, the doppler effect influences a soldiers rockets, causing the second and third rockets to hit the Pyro sooner than if they were standing still.** This affects the reflection timing that a pyro has to do, and may even cause the rockets to arrive while the airblast ability is still on cooldown. This would make the rocket effectively unreflectable. 

This paragraph is about why this works. A soldier firing rockets is a periodic function- that is, each rocket has a period where it is fired, and a period where it is on cooldown. To be precise, the cooldown is .8s, which makes the frequency of rocket fire 1.25Hz. The Doppler Effect acts upon a frequency source in motion relative to the observer. In our case, the frequency source is the Soldier, and the observer is the Pyro who is trying not to take rockets to the face. Now, if the Pyro can reflect at a rate of 1.25Hz (the same as a Soldier can fire, remember?), and the observed frequency of the rockets is greater than 1.25Hz, what happens when you try to make the second reflect? Depending on your relative velocities and the period during which the airblast will connect to a rocket and reflect it, you may or may not make the second reflect. For example, if you reflect the first rocket at the last possible moment the airblast will connect to the rocket, the second rocket will come before the airblast cooldown has ended, and you will take a rocket to the face. This isn't as bad if you time your first reflect really early, as you'll have more time to hit the second one, but each consecutive rocket will become more difficult to reflect. 

**[Edit]:**Let's do the math! We can determine the magnitude of the effect using the equation:

 f' = ((v^sound +/- v^observer )/(v^sound -/+ V^source ))*f

which translates into TF2 as:

Apparent Rocket Frequency = ((v^rocket +/- v^pyro )/(v^rocket -/+ v^soldier ) * Rocket Firing Frequency

We want to add the velocity of the pyro and subtract the velocity of the soldier because they're moving towards each other. Then we can pull the data on all of these values from the TF2 wiki. We now get this:

f^apparent = ((1100hu/s + 300hu/s)/(1100hu/s - 240hu/s)) * 1.25Hz

Since this is full of numbers we can solve for f^apparent:

f^apparent = (1400hu/s)/(860hu/s) * 1.25Hz
f^apparent = 1.6279 * 1.25
f^apparent = 2.0349Hz

Cool! Now we have an actual value that we can use to compare stuff! 2.0349Hz equates to a period of *drum roll* 0.4914s! Woah holy shit, that's actually a lot faster. I'd love to see someone go in game and measure this just to be sure. 

This paragraph is about what you should do during gameplay as each class. For Soldiers, the advantage you have is clear: Running towards a pyro firing rockets is more difficult to reflect and does more damage per second than trying to randomly stagger your rockets. Of course, you shouldn't forget about great strategies like using splash damage. So, run towards a Pyro and aim the first rocket outside of their airblast range. Then, you can try to plant the next few right in his face as his airblasts swing and miss. As a Pyro, you don't want to run at a Soldier if they know you're coming- though this is a bad idea regardless of whether you can time your reflects or not. It's just generally a bad idea to advance towards an opponent who's spotted you and has an advantage as strong as a rocket launcher. Remember pyromaniac habadashers: rockets do a lot of damage, so try to stay away from them. And like pregnancy, the only guaranteed method of prevention is abstinence or removing testicles (*and since you can't do anything about the testicles...*). As far as Pyros are concerned, this doesn't really change your optimal gameplay strategy much. It does help explain a few rockets that you swore you should be able to reflect.

I've got 2.75k hours in TF2, and a good portion of an engineering degree, but I haven't played TF2 since some time in June.

1358963576.0,121,self.truetf2,174svi,Viability of the Loose Cannon while Demoknighting,Veloxum,144,23,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/174svi/viability_of_the_loose_cannon_while_demoknighting/,"A [recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/174iy8/capping_last_with_loose_cannon) inspired me to write about something I've been doing for a while now.

One of biggest problems with Demoknighting is the shield. While you gain short-range mobility, you lose the ability to sticky jump. Grenade jumps will allow you to travel a little bit farther than nothing but they are unreliable if you are on an incline and the direction they bounce in is unpredictable. The Loose Cannon allows for more controlled grenade jumps simply by detonating the explosive inside of the gun.

I've been playing around with this loadout: Loose Cannon + Chargin' Targe + Claidheamh Mòr, we'll call it the Loose Chargin' Mòr. I'd like to point out that I am not at all sacrificing mobility, as I'm able to get from BLU's spawn gates to first point in less than two seconds. This is accomplished by doing a LC jump and charging near the peak of my jump, or about 2/3 of the way finished with the jump. 

Whenever I play with the stock loadout it's very difficult to deal with close-range threats, like scouts in my face. In actual combat with the Loose Chargin' Mòr, I find that I am that close-range threat. I can always be in someone's face. When I've had enough and I'm low on health, I can just knock them back with the LC to minimize their threat. This loadout tries to get sneaky picks by either isolating the enemy for a 1v1 or sneaking up behind them and charging for a crit sword. An interesting technique I've been able to pull off pretty consistently involves shooting someone with the LC and knocking them far away, [then using the nearby cannonball](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUKKoiZlibE&amp;t=0m41s) to jump toward the person I knocked back [and charge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_3uGSVvZ6I). It's been especially good at getting medic picks. Still, it spares nothing when the enemy retaliates, as the shield's resistances make the Demoknight one tough cookie to crack.

This is viable in Highlander because other classes can take up the Demoman's role of area denial, and the Soldier can fill the Demoman's role with the combo like in 6s.

Let me know what you think!

EDIT: [I have uploaded a video demonstrating the mobility of this loadout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWk6VjkMp4o).

EDIT 2: Yeah, it [works pretty well](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jnT8INvU1E) in competitive TF2.

##Scripts and Setup


There are many scripts out there for different purposes. As you continue to play scout you may find some of them very useful and some not very useful at all. Don't hesitate to ditch some of the less useful ones and substitute them with your own! Scripting is quite simple but if you don't feel like going through the effort of learning it (something I strongly encourage) I have compiled my personal scripts down below.


---

##A. Null-cancelling script

This script is so useful, you wouldn't believe it. Your movement becomes much more fluid, you can suddenly do tap dodging (more of that down below) and you will never ever become an easy target again because you stopped in mid air. It basically enables the new movement key to ""override"" the old one preventing the previous conflict where neither key was pressed.

&gt;bind w +mfwd
&gt;
&gt;bind s +mback
&gt;
&gt;bind a +mleft
&gt;
&gt;bind d +mright
&gt;
&gt;alias +mfwd ""-back;+forward;alias checkfwd +forward""
&gt;
&gt;alias +mback ""-forward;+back;alias checkback +back""
&gt;
&gt;alias +mleft ""-moveright;+moveleft;alias checkleft +moveleft""
&gt;
&gt;alias +mright ""-moveleft;+moveright;alias checkright +moveright""
&gt;
&gt;alias -mfwd ""-forward;checkback;alias checkfwd none""
&gt;
&gt;alias -mback ""-back;checkfwd;alias checkback none""
&gt;
&gt;alias -mleft ""-moveleft;checkright;alias checkleft none""
&gt;
&gt;alias -mright ""-moveright;checkleft;alias checkright none""
&gt;
&gt;alias checkfwd none
&gt;
&gt;alias checkback none
&gt;
&gt;alias checkleft none
&gt;
&gt;alias checkright none
&gt;
&gt;alias none """"


---


##B. Crouch Jump script

This script is quite simply in both, it's execution and it's purpose. As long as you hold down space you will crouch during your jump. This is useful for reaching otherwise hard to access places without crouch jump (ex. the small fence on the right side when coming from big door on gullywash).

&gt;bind space +crouchjump
&gt;
&gt;alias +crouchjump ""+jump;+duck""
&gt;
&gt;alias -crouchjump ""-jump;-duck""


---

##C. Mousebutton binds

This one isn't necessary at all but something I found to improve my gameplay a lot. Since the Scout doesn't have a secondary ability (apart from the double jump) you are free to use the mouse2 button.
This script binds the Scattergun to mouse1 and you will attack when pressing mouse1. It binds the pistol to mouse2 and it's attack to pressing mouse2. The bat is bound to 3 on the keyboard and it's attack is 3 aswell. However this script right here is customized to my likings. What that means? It has my personal crosshairs, viewmodels and sensitivity. Don't be afraid to change those. If you are unsure how just ask down below.

&gt;// scattergun
&gt;
&gt;alias ""+scatter"" ""slot1;+attack;cl_crosshair_file default;cl_crosshair_scale 20;cl_crosshair_red 0;cl_crosshair_green 128;cl_crosshair_blue 192;r_drawviewmodel 0;viewmodel_fov 0""
&gt;
&gt;alias ""-scatter"" ""-attack""
&gt;
&gt;// pistol
&gt;
&gt;alias ""+pistol"" ""slot2;+attack;cl_crosshair_file crosshair5;cl_crosshair_scale 32;cl_crosshair_red 0;cl_crosshair_green 255;cl_crosshair_blue 255;r_drawviewmodel 0;viewmodel_fov 0""
&gt;
&gt;alias ""-pistol"" ""-attack""
&gt;
&gt;// bat
&gt;
&gt;alias ""+bat"" ""slot3;+attack;cl_crosshair_file crosshair4;cl_crosshair_scale 32;cl_crosshair_red 255;cl_crosshair_green 255;cl_crosshair_blue 0;r_drawviewmodel 1;viewmodel_fov 54""

##E. Crosshair flash

This is a simple script that flashes your crosshair color everytime you press wasd. Useful for keeping track of your crosshair in the middle of the fight. Intended for use with the spy's ambassador but also works quite well with scouts.
Once again the colors that will flash can be edited by editing the cl_crosshair_color values.  
Warning: If you use this together with the null-canceling script put this into your config and erase all bind wasd lines.

##F. Aarons crosshair switcher

This is not an actual script but more a program that I urge you to use. What it does is, it creates a custom crosshair for every weapon. Create a crosshair, copy the color values, insert into the above scripts and you now customized the crosshair for the weapons (like mentioned in the mousebutton binds).


---

##G. viewmodels

Ah, viewmodels. Some people can't play without them. However turning them off is highly recommended. They will distract you and obscure your view. If you have auto-reload enabled they may even take up a large portion of your screen. If you want specific weapons to have them enabled just copy ""r_drawviewmodel 1;viewmodel_fov 54"" into the bind to equip that weapon. If you want them disabled type ""r_drawviewmodel 0;viewmodel_fov 0""
I advise turning them off for secondary and primary but keeping them on for your melee. You will know which weapon you are using by using custom crosshairs for every weapon.


---

##H. Tracers

Similiar to viewmodels they only obstruct your view. They are mostly inaccurate and don't really give you any feedback on if you actually hit someone. Just turn on hitsound and damage display as text.


---

##I. Auto reload

Why should you turn on auto reload? Why. the. hell. not? With disabled viewmodels there is literally no downside. There is no increase in time it takes to fire whilst reloading. Your current clip won't be ""discarded"". You can now bind useful stuff to r (like ""Need a dispenser here!"" or ""Spy!""). Do it. As simple as that.


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////



##Movement

I'll cover some of the most basic movement tips I got.


---

##A. How to move

You want to be unpredictable when dodging and preferably unseen when moving around the map. Think of playing scout like playing spy. Meatshot are your backstabs. With the exchange of mobility for cloaking. Also you can defend yourself a little better in 1v1 situations.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

##Vs. Soldier


Never ever ever ever engage a soldier head on. If he's at full health it's very difficult. If he's buffed then you may aswell just suicide and jump off a cliff. There are times when you have to 1v1 a soldier. Like when you are backcapping and their roaming soldier falls back to get you. Wait until he jumps. He'll waste a good portion of health on the jump and that's a pretty good advantage. Don't double jump. No seriously don't. If you double jump then you basically wasted your only steering tool in midair. And the next thing you know is that there will be a rocket where you are jumping waiting for you. Only engage soldiers if they are not buffed AND you can get a good meatshot off. Generally you want to get 1-2 meatshots off before retreating and poking with your pistol/chipshots. Most soldiers have the annoying habit to immeadietly shoot at their feet when they're being attacked from behind. Use this to your advantage. After the initial meatshot jump above their head and disorient them. If it's not necessary that you take him down there is no shame in retreating.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

##Vs. Demoman


Ah Demoman. They are to be honest a fairly easy target. Are they pipe spamming? Good job, you can move in with your scattergun as long as you remember to crouch and dodge inbetween. If he's piping you can safely double jump. Is he sticky spamming? Watch out for them and use your pistol to poke before you go in for the kill. You can also use your pistol to destroy stickies. You may double jump aswell. Watch out for soldiers coming to help him though.  

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

##Vs. Scouts


Don't jump. Mirror his movements if you are landing your shots. He strafes right (his perspective)? You strafe left. As simple as that. You won't have to adjust your aim as much if you can keep good track of him with your movement keys. Generally speaking scout vs. scout fights are often undesired and unneccesary. Concentrate on other picks. If you are _not_ landing your shots then by all means BAIL OUT! Act unpredictable. Jump inbetween. Change directions. Move away from him! If he lands a meatshot first you lost the encounter.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

##Vs. Medic


Do I really need to tell you how to pick a medic? Watch out for his pocket. Go in. Point and shoot.


---

##B. Patterns

Most patterns are extremely bad. The human mind is astonishingly good at predicting and recognizing patterns. And once your enemy figured them out you will die and die and die. However you can have pre-determined semi-random patterns. One of my favorites is: Move in one direction. Stop. Continue moving. Most people expect a change of direction after a pause. Going in the same confuses them. Don't do it twice in a row or you'll get shot down. Play MGE and find your own patterns. Experiment and have fun.


---

##C. Pattern interrupt

Break up your patterns. If you feel like you are doing something too much change it and mix it up. Combining different elements of different patterns is also nice.



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


##Aiming

---

##A. How to properly aim

Aim with your movement keys. You want to follow your opponent with your strafing. Then jerk/twitch in their direction and shot. Rinse and repeat.


---

##B. How to train your aim

Play either MGE or go on DM servers. I prefer DM servers because they allow for a more realistic setting where people are distracted and you can actually shoot them in the back. MGE is fine too.


---

##C. Muscle memory

Muscle memory is pretty important. I suggest you read a book/wikipedia article about it and then download one of the countless muscle memory maps there are.


---

##                                                          D. Sensitivity

Honestly play with whatever you are comfortable with. If you feel like you are overshooting your targets then lower it. If you feel like you are lagging behind up it a bit. Important is that you KEEP it once you found a good setting. Only then can you seriously train your muscle memory.



//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

No, really. Hear me out.

The new changes makes a lot of weapons newly viable for competitive TF2, give them new uses, open the way for some new ways of doing things. However the base meta for TF2 is pretty much unchanged.We might get a couple of new strategies from this latest update, but all-in-all, I don't think this is the absolute ground-breaking change that TF2 needs to bring in entirely new strategies and completely shake up the game. 

It seems that a large reason for this is because so much of the pace of TF2 revolves around an über. The invulnerability it grants your medic is incredibly powerful for any push, an advantage that no other medi-gun grants, providing support throughout the über, making it the defacto wait-for moment. Rounds are oft won and lost due to a single über.

And this is why I think the medi-gun should be banned.

^^^.  
[Surely you can't be serious.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A5t5_O8hdA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=11s)
---
---

Up until this point, the medi-gun's only real rival has been the kritzkrieg. The quickfix's lack of overheal made it almost completely unusable in competitive games. The Vaccinator, whilst a nice idea, really didn't provide enough benefits to a team to make it a truly viable alternative. The only reason the kritzkrieg was viable is because the catch-up when at an über disadvantage combined well with the devestation it could wreck upon a team to turn the tides.

Unfortunately, this is still true. Whilst the stock medi-gun is in play, the complete invulnerability that the medi-gun provides the medic trumps the insanely fast healing of the quick-fix and the bursts of healing that a vaccinator can pump out.

If we ban the medi-gun  we achieve an odd balance and harmony.

*The quickfix allows for supreme mobility, the medic can move with the roll-out to provide  completely new form of mid-fight. When the mid-fight is won, however, it makes sense for the losing team to switch…*

*To a kritzkrieg. The kritz will build fast and will be devastating, allowing for a strong push back. But now the Kritz can be mitigated…*

*By a vaccinator. With a couple of burst-übers building in seconds it will be ready almost as soon as it is in play to counter the incoming kritz. But unfortunately for the vaccinator…*

*The quickfix allows for back-caps like never before. Speed and mobility once again make for some serious flanking and superior positioning, a pocket soldier can take their medic with them out of a fight they're going to lose.*

All 3 medi-guns now provide completely different utilities that have different advantages over each other, yet all of them leave the medic vulnerable, as well as the players they're healing. No all powerful invulnerability that has been a part of the game since Day 0.

I think that by removing the stock medi-gun from play, we would end up seeing a very fresh game with a very different pace, where a lot of completely new tactics would suddenly become viable.

^^^.

I mainly want to spark discussion. Obviously theory is all very nice, but until you actually play several games with the non-stock medi-guns against other non-stock medi-guns would you really become acquainted with what the game would actually flow like. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe we'd end up with the same tactics, just with different medi-guns. Maybe someone's already tried this and can come back to me, telling me it's all hogwash.

After recently hitting 1300 hours of playtime I decided to try dipping my toes into competitive. So I tried lobbies for a bit, and since I feel most comfortable as heavy in highlander, I got picked up for a highlander team after only a few games, and now I'm playing my first season in UGC.

Now what I noticed was that both in lobbies and later on in the actual UGC matches is that people start playing before the game begins.
That is, as soon as people start joining the match server, people start noting things about the other team, like which classes the spy prefers disguising as, how good the pyro is at reflecting, how fast the heavy tracks, etc.

So what I started doing was, as soon as we joined the servers for the UGC matches, I changed my loadout, from MG-sandwich-GRU to MG-shotty-GRU, and strip to only a Mann Co. hat.

Then I play subtly bad. GRU until i see a enemy, so he gets a few mini-crit-shots on me. Lose scouts that get close. Ignore obvious spies. Run out of ammo because I don't let go of M1 for very long times. I usually end up being dominated fairly quickly, because people start exploiting the bad heavy, and figure that I'm pretty much a free kill.

So when the actual match starts the other team often ignores me, or puts me on low priority. So far, we've won most of the 1st rounds(KothH, CP) / 1st points(A/D, PL) in our matches because I'll get ignored and then do my job.

Last match, I got my entire team on board. All 9 of us played atrociously during pre-game. When the match started, we had half the other team shooting into our spawn. Heavy, demo, soldier and pyro, all stood up to our spawndoors and got wiped.

But after the match, some of my teammates voiced the concern that maybe this wasn't exactly the highest degree of sportsmanship, so we agreed to not do it anymore.

**My question:** Is deceiving the other team in pre-game justifiable? Is it wrong of me to do this, or is it just their fault for letting down their guard in a competitive match?

For some boneheaded reason, literally every crosshair I've found is either as wide as it is tall (square, circle, etc.) or *wider* than it is tall.

Hitboxes are *taller than they are wide*.

Dot crosshairs are hard to keep track of. If you rotate a ""konr-wings"" style crosshair 90 degrees, it is effectively a miniaturized version of your opponent's hitbox.

Just trying to help out a friend's (he goes by Monochromatic Bunny on Steam) cause, he's a colorblind TF2 player trying to get Valve to improve currently insufficient gameplay options for colorblind players

 &gt;   This petition was compiled as an appeal to make changes to Valve's current TF2 ""colorblind mode"" which, in its current state, is not sufficient. By signing the petition, you are expressing support of the proposed changes; such as reskins (black/white skins); or modified skins (saturated skins); or other alternatives that help alleviate excessive burden for the colorblind. The final result of colorblind mode should allow persons affected by true colorblindness (such as monochromacy) to be able to play the game at a comparable efficiency as those with normal vision.

The format would basically explain the history of a weapon, context of its release, and analysis into why Valve thought it would be a good idea, along with some wishful balance changes.

To give you an idea, I wrote up a quick little analysis of the Liberty Launcher last year.  The finished video will be similar in format to this, accompanied with interesting visuals, comparison to other weapons, and just general filmed gameplay analysis of the synergy with the class's arsenal.

Beware, the writing in this is incomplete and I'm sure there are a lot of typos. I didn't spend a lot of time clarifying certain aspects, but these will be covered in the subsequent video version with more detail.  This is merely to give you a rough idea of the content:

This is a prime example of a terrible post. Not because of the message hidden in the vulgarities and controversy, but because of the way that it was put across.

I try to take a hands-off approach to this subreddit. However, it's my opinion that the conduct of the post is intolerable. This subreddit exists as a platform for level headed discussion, not for emotionally charged bashing of people who likely aren't even going to have the opportunity to defend themselves. No proof of the wrongdoings was provided. We, as of this moment, don't have much to go on beyond the word of WafflesSandwhiches.

Let me make this clear: The removal happened because of *how* the post was presented. WaffleSandwhiches is free to resubmit a new thread on tf2centre if he so chooses. The development of tf2centre itself is one that is relevant to the community, and is worth a proper discussion. However, I don't think such behavior is desirable in this subreddit.

I'm leaving the original text here for the sake of accountability. I'd like to remind everyone not to jump for your pitchforks. 

Original Post:

&gt; I was debating for the longest time whether to release this information but now that I've been drinking, I'm saying fuck it. Fuck tf2cetner. Fuck the team. Fuck everyone involved they've fucked me really hard.

&gt; I was the 2nd developer on tf2center. I was the one who pushed really hard for matchmaking, because I know it's the one main aspect that competitive tf2 is really missing to fill in the competitive website puzzle. The lead developer kicked me off the team today for ""being to hard to reach"". I'm in US east, and he's in the netherlands, so we have a hard time getting times that work for both of us. But today he kicked me off the team. I have been devoting my efforts for almost 4 months sololy to bring together a comprehensive site to bring the gap between random pubs and tf2 competitive players. I contributed a lot to the site, fronted the money for server costs, and now I've been kicked to the curb right before release. THAT'S BULLSHIT.

&gt; We were actually supposed to have release on friday, but we've been delayed 2 weeks because of 'backend issues"". HINT: The main developer couldn't get his shit together.

&gt; No one on that site understands what a competitive site really needs. The main developer never plays tf2, and he's taking queues from a fucking 14 year old who can't keep his mouth shut and makes promises he can't deliver. They're all amateurs who don't understand what it takes to build a decent webpage, and none of them take any advice because they have a ""grand design"". It's an awful design and amazing, even though they only have 4 people on the team, everyone of them is a giant ass hat to work with. Fuck tf2center. Fuck that whole site.

DJC's prediction on the game:

bud &gt; xen 5-2 by dearjohncarter

This match will be the debut cast for ESEA TV's TF2 division, so make sure you guys tune in and check it out!! Self-promotion is much more important than actual predictions. Despite my many words about LASER BEAMS looking a bit shakier than they should so far, this should once again be a victory for them. I will make the magical prediction that TicTac winds up getting more from his uber pushes than Lange does, and mausy will show off the talent that earned him an Invite spot against the (thus far) struggling PYYYOUR, but Justin still has the ability to tear teams to shreds on sniper and he should not be challenged too much on scout. I will be interested to see how Seagull performs against a half-decent team, to see if he uses that gigantic TF2 brain to the best of its capabilities in match two of the season.

As you may remember from another reddit post (http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/v9wff/get_na_team_to_i46_xpost_from_tf2/) eXtelevision is partnering with the entire TF2 community to send a team of American players to the UK Insomnia 46 LAN late august 2012. While donations have been trickling in, we need another funding source: enter the Great North American EXtelevision Item, Hat, Key, Bud, Metal and all other TF2 Item Drive of Epic and Unprecedented Proportions (Name is a work in Progress). The goal of GNAEXIHKBMTIDE (as we at eXtv HQ so affectionately call it) is simple, gather the digital goodies of the TF2 legion, smelt down those that are only worth their scrap, hoard all the rest, and sell/auction/raffle off everything we have at the end of the drive. Sounds really super simple because it is. You can do one of three things.

1. DONATE ITEMS!!!!!! - we are in desperate need for items and this will be how we collect everything we need for steps two and three. We are taking anything (please smelt metal down beforehand) but in particular we want:
REFINED METAL &amp; KEYS 
Although we do accept individual weapons and other forms of metal, refined metal is the most convenient to sell on and therefore profit from. We'd love lots of this.
HATS &amp; OTHER ACCESSORIES 
These items will be used in large quantities for the lottery and auctioning bundles, as well as parts of other packs and prizes we will give away for profit towards the cause
STRANGE WEAPONS 
Strange weapons are really useful to us (especially the variants of normally used competitive weapons) and will be used in auctioning packs and other projects
PAINTS, TAGS &amp; DUEL TOKENS 
These will be used to personalise the aforementioned accessories, and while less useful then the other items in this list, they are still very much appreciated
If you have anything to donate at all, please add http://www.steamcommunity.com/id/extvauction on steam and trade away everything you can stand to part with. Every item will either be sold for money directly (and put right into the fund) or combined into auction or raffle prizes (the proceeds of which go right into the fund!) I know that some people just cannot afford to lose their triple whip vanilla chai latte with skim milk, three swirls from a stick of cinnamon grown in the valley of Bo and chocolate sprinkles in a large cup please keep the change, so if you fall into that category (or just cannot afford a donation) this is a great way to contribute. If you have already made a monetary donation, feel free to give here!

2. Donate Money (and get raffle tickets)!!!!!!!
For every five dollars that someone donates, that person gets one entry into our raffle. Though we are still collecting materials for the raffle, we already have quite a large hoard of hats, strange weapons, buds, bills hats and even one very special Unusual Hat! As we get closer to the end of the drive, we will announce what it is that will be in the raffle, but I assure you that thousands of dollars of TF2 items (as well as some super secret real life swag) will be up for grabs. If you donate more than 5 dollars, you get more than 1 ticket. With over 4 thousand dollars donated at the time of the post, there are 802 tickets all in the pot. Add yours today by donating at extv.chipin.com

3. Participate in the Auction!!!!!
At the end of the item drive, we will take our nicest items and put them up on the auction stage for everyone to bid on. Prepare your wallets though because this is where the best stuff is going to go. Things like unusual hats, earbuds, hat bundles are all up for grabbings! For this event, we are unveiling a super secret project of ours. There will be a limited number of complete strange item sets, each weapon carefully nametagged and giftwrapped by a famous invite player of that class. While we don't have any juicy details for now, lets just say you will look awesome hitting a triple airshot with your very own “TLR’s Own Strange Airshot Machine”. The raffle and the auction are two separate entities, the raffle is for everyone who donates 5 dollars or more, the auction is a public event where people (even those who didn't donate) bid on a separate stash of goodies.

The drive ends August 3rd, so get your donations in soon for your chance to win big. Remember it is all for a good cause, sending an American team to LAN will strengthen International TF2 ties, attract sponsors and help eXtv make a super special, super secret documentary about the first International TF2 LAN!

I have posted several already, and there are more to come (reddit doesn't like me posting lots of links in one go). Would be great if other teams could post their povs or their friends povs too and really get this knowledge database up and running.

The format of each post should be Team - Map - Gametype - ClassPOV - Division

Spread the word and pitch in!

However, no one really uses it because people find its buggy and takes too long. 

In reference to a comment made by Shadowtroop121 in another thread, think of how beneficial it would be if there was a matchmaking UI where you could choose to play  no crit/ no spread highlander. It would greatly expand the comp community as tons of new players would be introduced to a competitive style play. Since the skill level would be so low it would be like the ultimate newbie mix all the time, and valve could treat it like a new game mode, maybe even adding a tutorial. 

With all the attention drawn to competitive play, there would be a ton of new people joining ugc and more people playing lobby instead of valve 2fort. 

I'm not too good with programming, so I dont know how hard it would be to implement this, or if valve would even dedicate any servers but it would solve the problem that I keep hearing. ""TF2 comp scene is dying.""

##Introduction

Welcome to the jungle.  My name is Frank, and I'll be your tour guide.  I've played my share of pugs and lobbies, and have a total of 3 seasons under my belt from highlander and 6v6.  My goal here is to shed some light on a subject that is fairy under appreciated in the long list of guides to get your feet wet.
*****
##What is positioning?

If you think positioning is simply where you are standing, then prepare for me to tell you just how right you are.  Now that you are prepared, you are **wrong**.  What you've got is a simple definition of yourself, but remember, there is no I in team fortress 2, unless you are using roman numerals.  But you know what?  The Romans had bad positioning, and that's why we use the American 2, invented by our forefathers in an attempt to find the proper definition of positioning.

Positioning is a topic that involves all players on the field.  Remember that where you are standing has no bearing on the outcome of the game unless you are standing in the proper place in relation to both the enemy, and your own team.
*****
##Why should I be concerned about positioning?

Have you ever played a competitive style match?  Did you ever realize that you are now surrounded by 4 people, all prepared to turn you into a beautiful floor mat?  Well congratulations, you just made your way into a sweet frag video.  The problem is that you are officially on the wrong side of that video, and that needs to change.  Preferably by burning down the video owner's house with a combustible lemon, but that will wait for another guide on another day.

Proper positioning can lead you to favorable advantages that make the fight ahead miles easier.  A well positioned player can both shut down opposition, and look to make plays himself.
*****
##Transitioning from pub to competitive play

I will start with a story from my original set of TF2lobby games:

There I was, starry eyed, and ready to splash down on this competitive scene.  My position? Roaming soldier.  The glory hero. The champion to end every medic life there was.  After a fairly standard rollout on cp_granary, we all arrive at middle as usual.  As soon as exit the choke, I rocket jump directly onto their medic, and die gloriously before I even had a chance to give the enemy medic a single rocket to chew on.

What I did wrong was what I like to call **Terrible positioning**.  Ideally, you never want to be standing in a crowd of enemy players, especially when you telegraph your attack via flying towards them.  My biggest point for the reader to carry away with this short story is to know that when playing in a competitive setting, you will probably fail if you attempt to take on 4+ enemies at the same time, unless you know you have a very strong incentive to push in(all really low hp, ubercharge, enemy contracted cancer, etc).
*****
##Determining proper positioning

Determining proper positioning will requires something that is usually avoided: Thinking.  If you are standing by yourself, within a rocket's throw from the enemy TEAM, you need to reevaluate your decisions in life.  To determine if you should be falling back, ask yourself these questions:

* Does the enemy have more players alive?
* Are we at an uber disadvantage?
* Does the terrain favor the attacker?
* Are your flanks properly covered?
* If 2 enemies rounded a nearby corner, would you be ready to deal with them?

If any of these equate to yes, you should be in a falling back position, prepared to give up ground if the enemy makes a strong enough push in.  And likewise, the opposite is true as well.  If you can evaluate these questions for yourself as the attacker, it's time to take advantage of the situation.
*****
##Abusing poor enemy positioning

So did you follow the checklist above?  Are you up 2 men and have a 25% uber advantage?  Well it's time to bring the pain.  Also, it's time for another list.

* Enemy flank classes extended?

-- Deal with them as a team if they are far forward.

* Enemy flank classes dead/wounded?

-- Push your flank side forward hard, if you can secure the ground, you now can move both the flank and main combo in to pinch the enemy team

* Enemy combo extended?

-- Use the whole team's firepower to deal with forward enemies.

* Enemy combo dead/wounded?

-- Push the combo forward, and then crush their flank in the pinch maneuver.  If their roamers attempt to support their weak combo, have your flank push into the now vacant space on their flank side, and engage in the pinching. 

*****
##Practicing good positioning

The easy way to practice positioning is to think about it.  There I said it, you have to think.  A solid way to do this is to take your respawn times to evaluate how your previous life went(besides being totally badass).  Think about how you died, and if you should have played it out differently.  If you died near 4 enemies and without friendly support, you probably were overextending unless you are the roaming soldier attempting a pick.  If your flank was all dead, and your combo gets pinched really hard, it was time to back out.

Thinking about what happened every life is a very straightforward way of looking and evaluating.  Remember that positioning is also a team-based activity, and you need to be communicating with the players alongside you.  When all 6 players work together, the team can create a wall of pain.

Recently the Admins of #tf2.pug.na realized that the level of play in pug na is too high for most competitive tf2 players, and they wanted to introduce something that is open to lower level players.  #tf2.pug is that channel.

#tf2.pug is a 6v6 PUG organizational tool, much like tf2lobby, but made to simulate more what it's like to be on a real 6v6 team.  There is no fat-kidding like in pug na, anyone can join, and it's easy to operate.  

I like (http://matchmod.net/find-a-scrim/) for people that don't know how IRC works. 

The commands you'll need are ""!add [class]"" and maybe ""!players"" or ""!man"" to get a better idea of how the IRC channel works.  Just ask anyone on the pug.na or tf2.pug channels how to join tf2.pug.   

Things you'll need to know how to do:

1) Mumble (type in !mumble for the mumble server you need to connect to).

2) Connect to a server through console (go to options, enable developer's console, then press ""`"" or ""~"" button and paste in the connect line that the IRC channel gives you when you get picked).

3) Rollout, make basic calls, and general 6v6 and map knowledge.  If you don't have these things, please watch videos and read articles on how to play 6v6, that's the fastest way to learn if you don't know what 6v6 is!  I'm posting resources I like under this post and there are LOTS more in the sidebar.  [We are also starting newbie mixes soon.

I apologize in advance for the length of this post.

___

**Rollouts**

By far, the most common rollout I've seen is the right-side rollout, in which the team will take the right ramp into the [hallway](http://i.imgur.com/ge6XD.png), through the right side of yard, then out through [right garage](http://i.imgur.com/9ZuMY.jpg) to [the platform at mid](http://i.imgur.com/Kca2y.jpg).  From here, Soldiers can jump onto the roof covering mid and teams can then go about their basic strats.

Demomen can benefit from rolling out through [left garage](http://i.imgur.com/rUyai.jpg), because the open area allows for more speed than trying to stickyjump through the right garage.  There's also a large health pack inside the garage, but whether or not your Demoman decides to use it is up to him and your team's strategy.

___

**Middle analysis and Sniper lines**

The first thing I noticed about Foundry mid is that it's *VERY* Sniper-friendly.  For example, a fairly aggressive Sniper that takes the right side of the platform by the ammo pack can see [everything here within the blue lines](http://i.imgur.com/MC3w8.jpg).  Remember that he can slightly see into the right garage as well from his position, so there are few places that a Medic can safely build (green areas) until the other team's Sniper is taken out.

Engineers benefit most from using the Gunslinger/Wrangler on this map, as map is big and the enemy team can easily hide from a normal sentry's range.  Combined with the high number of ammo packs on this map, the Engineer has relatively free reign to hold down a point with his sentry or drop a mini and assist the offensive push with his Shotgun.

Soldiers can jump up on the roof of the middle point, and spam across to the enemy platform or spam down through holes in the roof.  Note that a Soldier can roll out to mid faster than most 5CP maps, due to Foundry's large number of props to jump off of.  A Soldier that gets to mid in over 20 seconds needs to work on their jumps.

Flanking classes [can get into left garage](http://i.imgur.com/oUJl2.jpg) through the underside by the right shack or through the small entrance by the train.  The medic combo ought to do their best to not got sniped - possibly by holding an aggressive lower position behind the right shack.  Remember that the most aggressive team on Foundry mid often wins it.

___

**Holding Garage**

If you've lost middle and you're stuck holding garage, [HOLD FROM UP HERE](http://i.imgur.com/jxXVy.jpg).  Not only do you get the height advantage, but it's difficult for anything other than a Soldier to jump up and surprise you there.

The left garage is easily flankable from many directions, and if you let the enemy Soldier or Demoman into the upper area on the right, he can spam through the roof joyces onto you.

___

**Attacking Garage**

Obviously, the opposite holds true for attacking garage.  See if you can't get a surprise Soldier or Demoman to jump up to the [upper platform](http://i.imgur.com/XX8LT.jpg)  and flush them out from behind.  Once they're on the ground, don't be afraid to take the upper areas of garage and spam them back to 2nd.  A Kritz rush works here pretty well, as enemy teams will often be clustered together to try to stop your advancement.

___

**Holding 2nd Point**

Holding 2nd, if you've lost garage, is difficult.  There's little to hold behind, and few places that an Engineer can safely put up a sentry.

If a Sniper gets on the upper platform, your team's pretty much done.  [He has some crazy view lines](http://i.imgur.com/lgcRN.jpg) that he can use against your team.  In addition, if the enemy Engineer gets up to that platform and puts down a wrangled Sentry, you better get him out of there fast.

A Soldier has a decent chance of spamming out anyone holding left garage from the train, but he'll be within the Sniper's easiest view lines.  Your Spy will be instrumental in disrupting a push from the rear, and should go for the Medic combo before the Sniper/Engineer up top.  Otherwise, defending 2nd comes down to who has the better DM.

___

**Attacking 2nd Point**

Congratulations, if you've made it this far, it's a downhill battle for you.    Get your Sniper and Engineer up to the upper platform.  The Soldier is also another great class to have up top, as he can defend those two from jumping classes and rain his own hell down on the point.  A push from right garage always works well, especially if you can wrap around the enemy team and strike them from behind.

___

**Holding Last Point**

If you're stuck here, you're probably going to end up losing the match.  Playing in this area is very offensively-stacked, so your team will have to rely on superior DM and strats.

DO NOT LET THEM TAKE THE [UPPER CATWALK](http://i.imgur.com/KFHVu.jpg).  Once they get into the room (red) or take over the catwalk, they'll rain endless hell onto your team, and you might as well stand in spawn until they decide to capture the point.  Hold your combo up top (and try to keep [the hill](http://i.imgur.com/MTt7p.jpg) if you can).  Keep a person or three on the point so you can't get backcapped.

___

**Attacking Last Point**

Obviously, you want the upper area to hold in your favor so you have some free reign.  Take the hill, and have your Engineer place a teleporter up there to keep pressure up.  His minisentry will be mostly worthless in an attacking position, so use it to cover your ass.

A heckling class push from the left door is a great distraction to pull some of the enemy out into the open, at which time you drop down with your Uber and demolish the other team.  All of the odds are in your favor here, so use them to your advantage.  Don't get out-fought and be smart about not letting anyone take the flank and killing a few of your teammates from behind.

___

Feel free to comment away, if you think anything should be added or if I've got anything wrong.  Obviously, this is about as basic as strats can get, so take everything with a grain of salt and make sure you practice your ass off for this map.

Ready Steady Pan is a competitive format, considered semi-serious, that ran last year some time in Europe. The idea was a 6v6 tournament that had players utilizing the Frying Pan melee item and various secondary and jumper weapons, with no medics.

This was the subreddit, last touched a month ago, of the tourney: http://www.reddit.com/r/readysteadypan/

I've contacted the admin over steam about a possibility for a second season, and he has given me the all-clear. The only problem is publicity and getting enough players in. If this kind of tournament would again run (which it has no reason not to), who would be inclined to join and form teams?

Here are the rules from the last season: https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1CdLGV5Gt7lFUIECg0_WtWTYB0wQvWrieS8fXpTWJ9fs

Here's the official steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/readysteadypan/

**Read:** The first thing I want to be sure about is involvement. If we get only 10 teams in this, it's not going to as great as it possibly could be.

According to the post, this update will alter the stats of DOZENS of weapons, making this easily the biggest weapon update in a long time.

The two changes brought up in this post affect the Dead Ringer and Battalion's Backup. 

Dead Ringer: Any damage taken after feigning death will reduce the remaining cloak time. 

Battalion's Backup: Charge is now gained by *dealing* damage, instead of receiving it, and the soldier gets additional damage resistance while it is activated.

ESEA is the premier Team Fortress 2 league in North America. Anyways, ESEA season 13 is about to get started but there is still time to register. There are only 8 days left in registration. ESEA has state of the art servers, great service and a huge prize pool and the end of the 3 month season.

To enter ESEA, you need to create a tf2 team and enter it into Open. ESEA is a pay to play league, there’s a onetime league fee along with a 6.95$/month premium charge which allows you to use our servers for practice, pugging and matches as well as various contests.

Each season consists of 2 matches per week for 8 week followed by a double elimination playoff to wrap it all up. Last season was our biggest yet and we’re hoping to have even more teams for this season. There is a huge skill range of teams in Open so you’re bound to find a bunch of great opponents who will give you a run for your money.

I came up with this in light of the fact that Spy is a support class.  I'm not trying to make him into a primary damage class.

**What about a Camera that marks a selected target for Death?**

- Camera would occupy Slot 1.
- Deal only 10% of the damage that the Revolver does.  So, only 2-4 points per hit.
- Emit a bright flash to maybe give away the Spy's location.  Think DSLR or ""Paparazzi"" flash camera.
- EDIT: Flash would be tinted Red/Blu depending on Spy's team color (kinda like how flames or decloak have a hint of the character's team color).
- Camera has telephoto lens enabling it to zoom.
- Target is marked for 15 seconds.  
- Only one or two targets at a time.  (not sure which is more useful or OP)
- All damage is Mini-Crits *or* Full Crits but camera flash needs to ""cool off"" before being ready again. (not sure which is more useful or OP)
- EDIT: [DaveFromMarketing has a better idea for a model](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/16wcdc/a_humble_idea_for_a_new_type_of_spy_weapon/c7zz3tp)
- EDIT: MexicanMouthwash suggested an even better camera in the Steam Workshop made by [Wowza](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=111771378)!

So, along with the normal (usually) point-blank Spy duties (take down teleporters, sentries, key picks), the spy can coordinate with the team and mark targets when team is pushing.

The telephoto camera also keeps with the Spy espionage theme.  There's always a scene in the Spy movie where the good guys look at photos of the bad guy that needs to be ""taken care of"".

The camera keeps with the idea that the Spy is a support class.

It's a situational weapon, not for use 100% of the time.

I can see this not helping the Lone Wolf pub Spy.  But, maybe with coordinated pub teams and possibly highlander…or even 9v9 or 6v6 based on the situation.

Again, this isn't fully thought-out.  Just a random idea that won't leave my head.

Thoughts?

EDIT 3:

Some great suggestions by [CuriositySphere](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/16wcdc/a_humble_idea_for_a_new_type_of_spy_weapon/c8056jx):

- Mini-Crits against the target
- No Damage at all by the camera
- Limited range of use (similar to a Sentry)

Thanks for all of the positive feedback!

There seems to be this attitude that trying to play well in pubs is stupid, trying in lobbies is stupid, trying in highlander (although this is going away now), trying in an open league, etc... In general, it appears that the only place where it is 'appropriate' to actually try to play well is if you're one of the 10 top 6's teams in the US.

On the other hand, the people in tf2.pug.na are extremely picky and condescending. You rarely see people trying to mentor new players or make suggestions to each other in a constructive way.

They're taking the right steps towards improving their skills - many are playing MGE or participating in a league of some sort.

This is all wonderful, but it's not enough.  If you want to get better, you have to vary your training.

I believe it's an old Bruce Lee quote that went along the lines of ""bring me a man who hasn't changed his training in a while and I'll show you a man whose physique hasn't changed in a while"".  The same goes for practicing your skills as a player.  This short guide will be aimed at getting you past your plateau in your gameplay.

___

**1. Solo Training Mods/Maps:** Jump maps, tr_walkway, tr_aim... Anything you can do by yourself to build your technical skills.  These are among the most basic of training mods.  Any player invested in getting better will begin with these training mods to build a strong base and continue to use them throughout their career to work on holes in their game.  What you take from these mods should be increased comfort in the most basic class skills - jumping, aiming, and movement.

Do a quick search in the subreddit search bar for sensitivity and you'll see we discuss it into the ground here - people are genuinely curious about how to make their aim better through sensitivity.  My advice is that you should be comfortable with whatever you pick, high or low.  I generally try to advise a player to lower their sensitivity as much as they can so that their mouse movements are less jittery while still being able to flick at least 180°.

**2. 1v1 Training Mods/Maps:** MGEMod, duels_midair, sniper_brawl... Any mods that put you against one other player in very focused and fast-paced deathmatch situations.  Without a strong base in the previous section, you'll fail at any of these mods.  

Now I have a note about MGE.  People come to me saying they play MGE often but they're not getting any better.  I tell them that if you want to get better at MGE, you play MGE.  Basically, what you learn in MGE isn't always going to carry over to other modes of play.  I praise MGE for its ability to build a number of technical skills quickly, but many people don't take away two of the most important lessons from the mod - positioning and awareness.

I explain in every video that I produce that high ground gives you an advantage.  This is true in MGE as well - how hard is it to overtake Spire?  However, players don't take this knowledge back over to their other modes of play.  Similarly, I prompt players to *listen* for the respawn sounds in MGE to work on their ability to identify players and their location by the positions of their sound.  If you're weak in being able to listen for enemy positioning, play some Quake - the entire game is about positional audio.  This is important in the next parts.

**3. Multiplayer Training Mods:** [TF2Lobby](http://www.tf2lobby.com) and SOAP DM.  I add Lobby here because it's poor for working on communication and teamwork.  Lobby can help build basic communication, such as basic enemy position calls.  Map knowledge is important for lobbies, especially rollouts and location names.  However, you can make up for this by using the skills you've already built - positioning, DM, jumps, and aim.  See how these all build on top of each other?

SOAP DM is a great change from MGE, and it's becoming much more popular.  If you haven't already tried it, the mod pits the competitive classes against each other (Scout, Soldier, Demo, Sniper) on the middle areas of the common 6's maps.  Positioning and awareness are more important than in MGE as you're now against up to 5 other people, so this mod works on your ability to keep track of several people at once.

**4. Teamwork:** With enough experience in your class you can join a team.  Any player who has properly built up their skills from the beginning will do well as a part of a team, but there are still always things to work on.

 - Communication.  If you're a Scout, one of your main class roles is to communicate whatever you see back to your combo and to listen for damage the rest of your team is putting out.  As a Soldier, since you have the advantage of being able to easily get up on the high ground, you'll be able to call out enemy positioning as you see it.  Demomen have to be able to relay who they damage to their Scouts so the Scouts can rush in and finish them off.  A Medic's main communication role is to make sure everyone on their team knows where he/she is.

 - Situational awareness.  As a team you'll have to learn how to hold a position, push through to the next point, or fall back depending on where your team is positioned and what enemies still live.  This is a skill only built through team experience.  Watch some videos of high-level play and you'll see teams who can push back from defending last because of one simple mistake the attacking team made.

Since my last post here, I've been focused on the UI and in turn user experience. As such, I have added a bunch of non-functioning menu items to try and get a feel for how I want it to look. I have also further optimized the methods which draw components on the screen, but they still aren't completely accurate, nor do I claim them to be. Still to-do: text, images. *Ideas for UI design welcome.*

To get them to be accurate, I have to load vtf files from the game itself. To load the vtf files, I have to load them from the gcf files... Would it be unreasonable to include those files in the editor, at least until I can implement loading of the local gcf and vtf files? The file size would jump at least 20mb higher from the current &lt;64kb, and I **really** don't like the thought of that for multiple reasons: updates changing or adding things, more to download/upload when something is updated.

Also included is an auto-update feature. Note that this feature can be buggy sometimes and overwrite the editor with a bogus copy - you will have to re-download it manually. *I will try to push a minor update out at least every 48 hours with at least one visible feature.*

I have started writing the code to deal with saving your modifications, but I think I will have to re-design a few things internally to make it function correctly.

Planned interface additions:

* Making the properties table content-sensitive. i.e, if the value is a colour, show a colour chooser.
* Drag and drop palette (labels, images, coloured rectangles)
* Making everything work :P

&gt; Upon playing around with different loadouts for a bit and studying various platinum play styles, I've come to the conclusion that the backburner is the best primary for pyro.

&gt; Since I'm typing this from a tablet, I'll keep it short. Backburner + shotgun gives you great overall coverage. You gain the high DPS in large fights with the backburner and good single target and support with a shotgun heavy style. Play a pudding cup esque passive play style with shotgun primary and break out the flamethrower when you go for a hard engage or when you feel you'll have to fight multiple people possibly. Keep in mind that the backburner does about the same DPS as the shotgun single target, though it can actually do way more thanks to back crits.

&gt; The real plus to the style is that you're especially deadly up close, so the enemy has to focus you or they die. This means you can create openings for teammates to do damage or take pressure off an ally. You basically have the same survivability as gas jockey.

&gt; The only real downside is you have to preserve air blasts vs ubers normally. Though realistically you'll generally need 3 or less air blasts vs ubers.

&gt; Try the style some time, it's pretty effective.

This will always be the case, since TF2 is an old game and this subreddit is a year old.

However, I've been thinking about it, and I realized that with a little bit of creativity, one can use each class's alternative primary weapons to increase their ability with the class's vanilla primary weapon.  Let's take the Soldier, for example:

___

 - **The Liberty Launcher:** With one less rocket in each clip and 40% increased rocket speed, the LL teaches smart and aggressive area denial, as well as being lenient on teaching a Soldier to lead technical shots.  For example, the LL can be used successfully to spam out a choke point, gain the edge on quick-thinking and quick-moving Scouts, put a rocket in between a weak enemy and his exit path before he has time to react, and pocket the Medic by denying jumpers an easy kill (as it is arguably easier to airshot with the LL due to increased rocket speed).  Lack of one rocket means that the Soldier needs to be smart about where he clicks M1, and has to realize that he cannot do as much upfront damage as a Soldier with 4 rockets.

*Lessons: Area denial, lining up technical shots, rocket conservation*

 - **The Cow Mangler 5000:**  Without the ability to receive Kritz from a Medic, the CM5K is limited to a very passive, area-denial style of gameplay.  The extra shot that the Soldier gets before recharge means he is more apt to take chipshots at groups of enemies.  Lack of need for ammunition means that this style of Soldier can focus more on taking control of a choke point or providing extra cover fire than looking for ammo packs.  A well-coordinated and well-timed charged shot can either be devastating to a group of enemies or can keep a Sentry down long enough for another player to focus it down.

*Lessons: Medic/Combo support, coordination*

 - **The Black Box:**  Encourages roamer-style play by being lenient with the amount of health the Soldier has to seek.  A Black Box user gains the most benefit by taking distance chipshots on enemies or groups of enemies, and acting as a distraction without necessarily sacrificing his life to do so.  Lack of one rocket means that this style of gameplay forces the Soldier to be smart about approaching other Soldiers, heavies, or groups of enemies.

*Lessons: Picking targets, distraction/getaway, basic roaming, rocket conservation*

 - **Direct Hit:**  Encourages high risk, high reward style of play with increased damage output and easily lined-up technical shots.  Lack of a blast radius requires a DH user to have high accuracy and leading ability, but reduces the Soldier's ability to hold true area denial.  Increased damage on technical shots, such as juggling or airshots, encourages a DH user to be aggressive and decisive about taking said shots.

*Lessons: Accuracy, technical shots*

___

Each one of these is translatable to the vanilla Rocket Launcher.  A Soldier, without accuracy, is just as good to his team sitting in his spawn room.  Several of his weapons encourage choke-busting and relying on fewer rockets per clip, teaching him how to be choosy with his rocket placement.

Examples can be picked out of any of the nine classes (Spy knives, Sniper rifles, etc.).  Don't be afraid to experiment with different primaries and figure out how those can equate to your skill with your preferred primary.

ITT, feel free to discuss primaries and ask how to use one to improve your skill with another.

Foreword

So after deliberation I’ve decided to write a succinct guide for playing Spy in Highlander. Generally speaking, this guide is aimed at spies rather new to the competitive scene, to make them aware of the various jobs the spy must do to fulfil his class’s potential. The guide is supposed to be written as objectively as possible, but naturally some personal opinions are going to eke their way in. I'm bound to have forgotten a bunch of stuff, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated, and if there’re any responses which I feel are particularly useful, I’ll incorporate them here with full credit.
So without further ado…

Afterword

Your Role:

Ok so of course I am aware of the significant contribution to the Spy class made by Watsyurdeal? (a.k.a. TheSentryisaSpy). His videos sum a vast encyclopaedia detailing the ins-and-outs of the role of the Spy, so for those of you that haven’t seen them (which, let’s face it, is probably no-one) I’d highly recommend them. Here, however, I thought I’d describe a more Highlander-oriented Spy role.
In a nutshell, the aim of the Highlander Spy is to cause as much disruption and inefficiency among the enemy ranks as possible, while simultaneously safeguarding your team against major threats. This safeguarding splits into two distinct categories: Communication and Priorities.

i)Communication:

The Spy has a completely unique view of the battlefield; the majority of your time will be spent behind the enemy lines. From this vantage point you can view the intricate details of your opponents’ set-up. This insight must be taken advantage of: It is vital that the positions of the Combo are called, and when you glimpse the Medic the percentage of his Über is relayed to your team. A lot of Spies also forget to regularly check whether the opponent Medic is running Kritz or Über. If your team dies to a surprise Kritz, it’s the Spy’s fault. The positions of the Sentry and Sniper are also highly important. A lot of the Spy’s work is communicating with his/her team, so use that mic!

ii)Priorities:

Stating the obvious: you have a knife which insta-kills. This means if played correctly you have the ability to topple your opponents’ most powerful asset. Generally, the entire game revolves around the Übercharge. If you can drop the Medic, then it’s going to be at least 40 seconds before they have an Über again, without factoring in respawn and slower-charge times. It’s pretty clear here that the Medic is usually your top priority. Of course, it is naïve to assume that you’re going to be able to drop the Medic ad infinitum, so aiming for the heavy classes (I’m just thinking of the Heavy and Demo here) will also squash their potential to wreak havoc with an Über.
A lot of teams let their Snipers duke it out in 1v1 and tell their Spy to focus on the combo. However, if you can pick off their Sniper often enough, your own Sniper is going to have free reign over a lot of space to shut down a lot of your enemy’s options. This advantage is often under-estimated.

When attacking the final point of a map, the opponent’s Sentry can offer a formidable defence (just think of Upwards’s last point). It’s a common misconception that it’s always a Spy’s job to take down Sentries. In this situation, however, a Sentry destruction would allow your team to focus on the enemy combo with dramatically reduced external pressure. A useful tactic is to try and synchronise the sapping of a sentry with your team’s Combo push to quickly destroy the Sentry.
A key factor in a team’s efficiency is its mobility. A simple teleport destruction can severely hinder your opponent’s movement, making them lose a lot of time on the clock. Remember, on Payload, it’s ALL about the clock.

iii)Illusions:

Keeping the team unsure of your location and your plan is important. Simple tricks such as using friendly disguises (especially with the Dead Ringer), or quick double-feigns (where possible) can sometimes make the opposing team relay false information. It’s also beneficial if you rotate disguises instead of sticking to one continuous disguise. 
Sidenote: The scout disguise, despite what people may say, is completely viable in highlander, as you make yourself as small as possible.

iv)Application/Dealing with Pyros:

So that’s all very well and good: you’re now a walking, talking Spy who knows who to stab, but naturally putting this into practice is far from simple: You’re not going to be able to take down the top priorities all of the time. A mistake so many Spies make is their impatience: they aim for the Medic with great aplomb, only to be burned and rejected by the enemy Pyro. Learning nothing, this process is repeated ad nauseam until all that’s happened is a lot of wasted time. This “suicide spy” mantra is grossly inefficient; you need to maximise your potential.
Hence, knowing the status of the opposing Pyro is of great importance. It is generally a good idea to aim for the key threats to your team that their Pyro isn’t guarding, and when you want a juicy combo-pick observe when the Pyro is engrossed in something else and strike. But as my friend Arctic pointed out, you don't have to wait for the God's of Chance to distract the Pyro: telling your team to spam projectiles at the Medic or Sentry is a great way to induce the Pyro into projectile-reflecting. As soon as you hear that their Pyro is down you want to manoeuvre yourself into a position that will give you a great chance of getting a lovely Medic stab. Once when speaking with Hurri, he said that he seemed to find teams became sloppy at spy checking when they were organising a push. That window of just a few seconds should be all you need to punish their unawareness.
Now the above segment was rather passively written; a lot of the time you can still attack whilst the Pyro is spychecking. I spoke to Fearboy on the matter and he made the excellent point: Walls are your friends. Some spies hide behind walls and use this more than their cloak to ascertain the position of the enemy Pyro. By listening to the sound of his/her flames it is possible to locate exactly where he/she is. As soon as the Pyro steps a little too far in the wrong direction, you have your chance. Sometimes full-on aggression is the only solution; there will be times when you know their Medic has full/almost full Übercharge and needs to be neutralised. Although you will be forced to enter into a risky scenario, the potential of the Über is worth more than your life.

v)Quick Summary:

To summarise: you are a support class, run to cause disharmony amongst the enemy. In getting key picks, you’re probably going to die quite often, but your K/D ratio is to not at all be regarded: so long as you’re disrupting their team and neutralising threats you’re doing your job correctly. Of course, TF2 is very situational. You yourself will have to figure out the required compromises between aggression and pacifism: You don't want to be too passive in that you're inactive, but you don't want to be too aggressive in that you're constantly dead. Each situation will require a differing amount of aggression, and it will change every match. Naturally, if your team is stomping the other, then you can afford to be aggressive without much thought. If however you're finding yourselves losing, your approach will require many considerations. It's these considerations, knowing how to attack in any situation, that make the godliest Spies.

Map-type specifics

Payload

Attack:

Pushing the cart is a task that is normally left to the scout +1 (most often the engineer). There are however situations whereby a Spy will be able to sneakily push the cart a small but crucial distance when the opponents are otherwise occupied, so always keep an eye on the enemy’s movements. One of the opponent’s main assets will be their Level 3 Sentry, so it’s crucial to coordinate a sapping with the push of your team. Once their Engineer goes down at the first point, a valid tactic is to try and keep him completely shut down for the rest of the game, destroying everything he tries to build. Other than that, it’s pretty standard requirements: try and get key picks that will limit their defensive resources.

Defence:

At the beginning of the round, you should not concern yourself with the cart. If you manage to pick the scout, but die, you’ve effectively achieved nothing as their respawn times will be shorter, and they’ll have others to push on the cart. After the set-up time has elapsed, you’re required to stop that Über push. Communicate exactly which door they’re pushing from and try your very best to nab one of the Combo. I’ll add that the set-up time does allow you to get into a nice position with the Cloak and Dagger. Payload maps really are a wonderful place for the Spy to get to work, as there are so many spots which are safe to decloak, and so much metal that you have many different options available in deciding how to taking their team down. Make sure you destroy the Teleporters, forcing them to walk all the way to the cart and gaining valuable time. Medic picks, of course, will gain your team an incredible amount of time (assuming your Medic doesn’t die).

5CP:

These maps tend to arrive at many a stalemate (consider Granary and Foundry) with equally-matched teams. The stand-off situations which arise mean that the opponents will have more watchful eyes on their key assets. Hence, you and your speed of approach will generally be slowed. You’re going to run into difficulties here if you can only use the Dead Ringer; once equilibrium has been established, it will be very tricky to infiltrate undetected. The generally slow-pace of the matches means that the Cloak and Dagger can be very effective, if only for observational purposes: if you see an opponent (e.g. Sniper) trying to peak, you must tell your team immediately which choke-point to spam to punish over-extension. Plenty of consideration will have to go into your plan of action, as getting a key pick will allow your team to push through to the next point. A very passive but sometimes effective style of play is to camp a blind spot with the Cloak and Dagger, and wait for the opposing team to push closer to you. This will not be to everyone’s taste, however.

A nice feature of 5CP maps is the excellent chance you will have to spawn camp specific players, a perfectly valid tactic to keep one of their assets shut down. Always note the exact positioning of their team, as an over-extended team can fall flat to a sneaky Spy cap in the right circumstances.

KOTH:

In order to play king of the hill, you must learn the particular spots in which it’s safe to decloak. On KOTH these decloak spots are very rarely occupied, unlike the ever-changing positions of teams on 5CP. Particular spots that come to mind are the house on Viaduct, or between the pillars on Lakeside. I don’t think the Cloak and Dagger really makes an appearance on these maps; it seems more suited for 5CP style play, but feel free to correct me here.
Snipers have excellent sightlines on these maps, so a crucial aim is the neutralisation of the opposing Sniper. Not only will this give your team more room to breathe, but your own team’s Sniper can then acquire excellent vantage points worry-free.

It can be tricky to secure a stab on the Combo before they start a push, so stalking the high ground is a very useful way to survey the battlefield and drop down when the time is right. I personally believe that the Diamondback can really come into its own here; take down a minisentry or two and you can severely intimidate the enemy Medic.
It's necessary to keep an eye on the cloak, you may occasionally be called to solo cap a point, (but lurking behind enemy lines is your primary goal).

Loadouts:

Now I’m going to focus on the tools in your arsenal which will bring about this disruption. There are countless threads detailing to death the specifications of every Spy weapon, and I’m not going to make you read another Spy’s opinion on the Revolver/Ambassador “Debate” for the umpteenth time. This section will just briefly and objectively state the relative merits of the weapons in a Highlander scenario.

i)Guns:

There are plenty of different gun options available to the Spy. It’s mostly just a matter of taste.

i)i)Revolver:

A powerhouse of a gun, it packs a lot of damage at close range and can easily pick off many weak targets rapidly. Basically useless at firing long distances

i)ii)Ambassador:

If you can consistently get headshots, then this weapon is for you. If you can’t aim very well, stick to the Revolver. The nice thing about the Amby is its ability to fire long distances.

i)iii)Diamondback:

Certainly viable in Highlander. I’d like someone to write a larger review for this- an appraisal would be appreciated- but I believe that this weapon can be beautifully used on Koth maps, or others where the Engineer spams out minisentries.

i)iv)L’Entranger:

Pointless. BECAUSE: this does not increase the chances of your survivability. A good spy knows how to handle his cloak. Therefore anything which gives you extra cloak in return for less damage becomes useless.

i)v)Enforcer:

Banned.

ii)Sappers:

ii)i)Red-Tape Recorder:

Banned.

ii)ii)Standard Sapper:

Your only option!

iii)Knives:

iii)i)Stock Knife:

The most flexible knife in Highlander. Does what it says on the tin.

iii)ii)Kunai:

The reward of kunai comes after the stab and the point of spy is getting a good stab, not surviving after it.

iii)iii)Your Eternal Reward:

Could possibly be used for 1 life in an attempt to get a sneaky chainstab with the reduced sound but overall you're better off picking another knife.

iii)iv)Spycicle:

The only other knife you’ll use besides the Stock. Let’s you get away from Pyros rather easily. A Spy known as Evan (on youtube “stingcandy”) has made some interesting videos on why he believes the metagame of the spy is evolving to Revolver+Spycicle+Dead Ringer. Well worth watching.

iii)v)Big Earner:

Pointless. See L'etranger

iv)Watches:

The nice thing about the Spy is that every watch is viable in Highlander, and your choice of watch will highly depend upon the situation your team is in.

iv)i)Invisibility Watch:

A very useful and flexible watch, you can get to where you want to be undetected.

iv)ii)Cloak and Dagger:

In stark contrast to Pubs, this watch is incredibly useful in Highlander. Just by sitting in useful spots you can relay vital information to your team and slowly shift into a good position.

iv)iii)Dead Ringer:

Often over-used, but incredibly powerful. I’ve personally found this watch to be much more viable on Payload than 5cp.

Afterword:

That pretty much sums up everything I have to say. Hopefully I haven’t forgotten anything vital. Like I said at the beginning, feedback would be awesome; let me know whether the “Loadouts” section should be expanded/removed completely. Feel free to add me on Steam to discuss anything.

This is why you guys gotta hype this like mad!

(Hildreth wrote this)

You guys are super special and the single most keen Highlander loving community in TF2. So I have chosen this website to begin promoting what I hope will be a highly anticipated showmatch between The Syndicate (the top dogs in UGC Platinum NA at the moment) and the self-crowned world's best Highlander team - SNSD (undefeated in EU officials for the last two years). With all of the EU v NA hype going down recently, it feels like it is the right time to bring it to HL. 

The match will be on Sunday 14th October at 9.15pm Central European Time - That is 3.15pm East Coast time, 12.15pm West coast time. Tune in at VanillaTV where the casters will possibly be either Sal/Extine, myself and maybe Admirable. The game will be played on a New York server provided by eXtv / eoreality so big shoutout to them. Both teams have already tested the server, with The Syndicate being majority West Coast, we'll see both teams rack up an average of 90-120 ping per player with the exception of TMP and his amazing internet (no pressure). 

The maps will be Badwater, Granary and Lakeside after both teams agreed on a variety of gamemodes and specific map choices. 

The purpose of the match is to bring the two Highlander scenes more together, making Europeans more aware of the great teams forming in NA since the invite limit was removed and also promote the start of ETF2L Season 3, which will have a prize fund and will start signups on Monday 15th October. 

Please make as many people aware of this game as possible, I am hoping this game will bring in many unique players to watching HL so it is a chance for -ts- to show the world their talent as they face a team that has never lost a Highlander official in their 2 year history. You will see a lot more hype and promotion come up all over TF2 websites in the next few days so keep an eye out and tell your friends.

Thanks.

**Predictions**

DT &gt; BP 5-4 by dearjohncarter

There is no doubt this is the match of the week, and it might go down as the best match of the season for all the storylines involved. The Tyrone/b4nny split and the way the LG roster got divided up, combined with the amazing LAN matches between Spacewhales and LG – this one's going to come down to nipple hairs. Shrugger was one of the best scouts at Process in his season with Mihaly's Flow and should use a constant 185 health to guard Shade and pick off stragglers on the flank on the middle. B4nny will have his usual massive impact and output more damage than anyone by several thousand, but I think it comes down to uber exchanges: can Tyrone do as much damage as Lansky, and can he do it for the duration of the match instead of his on-and-off uber pushes from season's past?

___

**OFFENSE**

1. *Be aggressive.*  A lot of Medics wait to push until they have an Uber advantage, and that doesn't work.  Giving the defense any sort of time to get re-situated on a point quickly reverses the advantage back in their favor.  If you have the opportunity, especially on a Payload map, to go forward to the next defensive spot and control it, grab that opportunity and use it.

2. *Be decisive.*  This one's going to be especially important this week on cp_steel.  Once you make a call, go through with it.  The time you spend hesitating on the field deciding what to do next is the easiest time for the enemy team to kill you.  If you need to fall back, make the call and fall back; otherwise stick with your hold or be poised to call the push forward.  If you go through with your call, then question it halfway through a push and turn around, you'll most likely die.

___

**DEFENSE**

1. *Be aggressive.*  What?  Yeah.  Being aggressive on defense also has some huge advantages.  If you can consistently keep the offense hurt, down in numbers, or forcing pops early, you're going to have a field day with your holds.  Being passive has its moments, but the rewards for being aggressive are often far greater than sitting around.

2. *Play with numbers.*  Hopefully everyone is familiar with counting Uber - the idea that it takes roughly 40 seconds for a Medic to build up a charge.  As a Medic, you'll have to learn how to do this subconsciously.  I almost always have my scoreboard up if I'm not in a fight, and if I see the Medic respawn I know that my team is safe from Uber for another 40 seconds.  You can use this time any way you like - pushing in with your own Uber advantages, stalling the cap, or getting better situated on a point.

3. *Is it Spy time?*  My team and I play a mindgame during matches called ""Spy Time"".  Basically, it means that several of us are keeping track of the Spy's respawn, and 20 or 30 seconds later we'll call out ""It's Spy time!"", because that's about how long it'll take for a Spy to get into position to go for a pick.  This is when my team re-doubles their Spy-checking efforts.  I find that this game is often more important on Defense than it is on Offense, but it's good practice to keep Spy Time in mind the entire game.

___

**GENERAL**


1. *Be assertive.*  This is my favorite part of being a Medic.  YOU HAVE FULL CONTROL.  USE IT.  You can tell your team where to be, when to go, and have them come to you so that you can give them overheals.  You have the power to even tell your team to suicide to force the enemy so that your push is easier.

2. *Be confident.*  Even if you aren't 100% invested in your call, your teammates are looking to you for judgement and information, and will often mirror your state of confidence.  If you're obviously frustrated or confused, it won't help your team any.  

3. *Heal everyone.*  Obviously it's important to keep your Heavy classes even heavier by giving them constant overheals, but what about the rest of your team?  Snipers can benefit from being over 150 health because they won't get quickscoped by an enemy Sniper.  Scouts with 185 health are the god damned scariest thing in TF2.  Make sure that everyone's getting buffs, and don't be afraid to tell someone to go get a health pack if it makes giving heals out easier for you.  I personally feel that my Heavy's okay sitting at less than 150% health and I'd rather spread heals to 3 or 4 other classes in the time that it takes to fully heal my Heavy up.

4. *It's okay to die and drop sometimes.*  I don't mean to make an example of anyone, but next time you watch a Platinum Highlander cast make a note of which Medic is more aggressive and which team is winning because of it.  Generally, the more aggressive Medic will die more, but it's okay because he'll be in the fight the entire time he's up and spreading the heals necessary for his team to win the fight.  A Medic that runs away from a push often isn't healing and even though he may die less because he got away from the fight, his team will suffer.  Even if pushing in means you die, it can be for the benefit of the team.

5. *It's okay to pop too.*  If it means saving your life and getting outta there, use your Uber.  If you can grab someone else and help them escape too, great.

6. *Learn Sniper sightlines.* Don't stand in them.  Easiest advice I can give.  (This applies to all classes)

7. *Eyes in the back of your head.*  Keep your head on a swivel; that is to say, constantly check behind you for something that might look fishy.  My rule is 3 seconds looking forward, 1 second looking back.  If you're holding and you feel relatively safe, put some more attention on looking around corners for Spies.",,False,,t5_2stfn,1362029506.0,,flair-medic,True,t3_19co0b,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/19co0b/hl_tips_for_medics/,

FAQ
----

### I am having issues, it crashes. How can I fix this?

&gt; Try the following things:
&gt;
&gt; * Make sure you unzip your program before running it, otherwise it won't be able to find any of the files it needs
&gt; * Upgrade java to its latest version, earlier java version don't work very well with this program
&gt; * Try to generate the scripts locally, and copying them manually the the tf/cfg directory in the team fortress installation directory
&gt; * Post an explanation + screenshot (if applicable) with the crash/issue on my github page: github.com/logophobia/YetAnotherTF2ConfigGenerator or add me at steamcommunity.com/id/logophobia

### What is viewmodel switch mode?

&gt; It indicates when the viewmodel is turned off if that is set for the weapon slot:
&gt;
&gt; * Immediately after switching weapons
&gt; * After firing a weapon
&gt; * After switching strafe directions
&gt; * After either firing or strafing

### I have a feature request, where can I post it?

&gt; Post any suggestions on the github page or in the thread where you found the program

### What does medic radar do precisely?

&gt; It toggles medic autocall to 150%, so each of your teammates has a medic symbol above their heads, which you can see through walls. As soon as you let go of the button, it will go back to its original autocall level

### How can I customize this even more?

&gt; You could try editing the original templates, in the template directory. First, delete the cache directory. Then edit the templates, the language used is ssp: http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html. After that, the program will use your editted version of the templates. 

### What other ways to customize tf2 are there?

&gt; You can install custom huds, skins, hitsounds or customize/make your own scripts

### My ambassador crosshair disappeared, how can I fix this?

&gt; For some reason, the crosshair after shooting is about half the default size. Increasing the size of the spy primary crosshair should fix this.

### Changing settings inside tf2 doesn't work, it just gets changed back. How can I change my settings?

&gt; The scripts that were installed now regulate most of your settings inside tf2. Change stuff through the program, and then reinstall the scripts, or uninstall the scripts and be free to change things inside tf2 again.

### Can I use my settings from a version of your program before 1.0

&gt; Yes. Drag the settings.xml file from your old program into the profile folder of the new program. Now you should be able to load your settings from the profile menu.",,False,,t5_2stfn,1356265977.0,,,True,t3_15abr0,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/15abr0/tf2configgenerator_version_10_release_candidate/,

I can almost guarantee that for almost all beginners their big problem is over-extending. Being too aggressive. Its something that I still deal with, and something that even the top levels deal with. Cut down your deaths by not getting yourself in unwinable situations.

MGE is great for practice, but dont hang your hat on it. You can place in the top 3 in all the pubs you play? Thats great, but we are talking competitive TF2 here. The best thing to do to get better is to play comp TF2. Find a team. Talk to your team about class roles. Watch strategy videos and try to think of strategies yourself. Your game-sense will improve and so will your value on your team. Bring friends into the game, if you like to play with certain people, get them to form a team with you.

I've always been kind of disenfranchised with the Spy community at large, and so I wanted to give me back in my own way, this is just a bunch of stuff I've been working on over the past few months and I hope you guys enjoy it or find it helpful.

**FRAG VIDEO:**

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wn096jQhyM&amp;hd=1

This is my first TF2 montage that I've ever made, so I understand it's not exactly the best ever and there's quite a few things I wish I had more time to improve/fix (like the somewhat abrupt ending), but I need to kind of wrap this project up and just get it out there.

This is kind of a ""concept"" video. I didn't exactly get all the kinds of clips I wanted, but I restricted myself to matches only as I didn't want to record a demo of every single scrim nor record VOIP/get STV for potentially every single scrim. This was much easier, limited me in clip selection though.

Basically, I am kind of disenfranchised from most Spy frag videos as they focus too much on ~trickstabs~ or throw away frags, and usually get repetitive. I wanted to make a Spy video that wasn't about any of that, and solely focuses on ~BIG PLAYS~. Even if I had a rather limited selection of clips from only 1 season worth of matches, I hope I did a good job at this. I was strapped for time so many of these clips aren't exactly as obvious of important plays as I would like them to be, but generally every pick in this video either lead to a point captured/being successfully defended or completing the objective/winning the round or was, in general, just a big dick play. I left the HUD on on many of the clips so that you can see the round timers/point captures/etc to kind of infer the importance of some of them since I couldn't do it in a more obvious manner.

Again, this is my first vid, so take it a bit easy on me, but I hope it isn't too terrible and you guys enjoy it.

I'd just like to take a moment to thank all the team leaders (and also those in a scheduling position) for their work. It can't be easy trying to coordinate a group of 6 or 9 players with another group of players. Everyone always has different schedules and I imagine it can be frustrating trying to find subs when a player unexpectedly can't make it to a match or scrim. God forbid you have the make the call to cut somebody and look for a replacement. 

Depending on your team, you may also have to deal with an unreasonable amount of bitching or complaining. Especially if your team is going through a rough patch. Keeping the morale up isn't easy and somebody is gonna have to pick up the slack or everyone can suffer as a result. Depending on your division, it can also mean so much more. In lower divisions where teammates may not know the maps so well, SOMEBODY has to come up with a strat or two. A lot of times that responsibility can fall down to one or two people, and the whole team looks to them for guidance.

## Introduction

Welcome to the academy.  My name is Frank.  People around these parts know me as bflFrank and lfbFrank, but you can call me Frank.  If that offends you, call me by my steam name, bfl` Frank, or for short, Frank.

My personal resume from Team Fortress consists of about 1400 hours total played, 2 seasons of highlander, and 1 season of 6v6(roaming).  My goal here is to shed some light on the daily life of playing as a competitive soldier, and what you should expect when you decide it is time to play ~~Soldier~~ the best class.
*****
## Why Soldier?

Soldier is an incredibly well rounded class.  With near-perfect play, you can become a jack of all trades, and master of all trades.  You are counted on to make big plays, stop bigger plays, and get sweet frag video clips in the process.  As a soldier, you have the distinct advantage as being a mobile powerhouse, with very strong short to mid-range firepower.  The downsides to the soldier are fairly direct: slow speeds without expending ammo/health and a fairly lengthy reload when completely depleted on ammunition.

If you want to play as a solid foundation to the team, with an emphasis on doing everything, 6v6 as a pocket soldier is the way to go.  

If huge bombastic plays where you throw yourself into proverbial pit of lava called the entire enemy team, then it's time to bring out the roaming plays on both 6v6 and highlander.
*****
## Playstyles

This section is going to be divided for the different roles:

##Pocket 6v6

You are the champion of the team.  Without you, your team is a giant blob of sissies waiting to be killed.  Pocket soldiers are required to be the defensive champion, and assistant-artillery cannon with your demoman.  The goal here is quite simple, keep your medic and demoman safe, while being a front line combatant when enemies are nearby.  Only go for huge bombs onto the enemy team when you have a **clear** advantage.  Simple questions to determine that would be: Is the enemy team weak(low hp)?  Do we have uber, and they don't?  Essentially, save the big plays for when you know you can make the big plays.

##Roaming 6v6 + HL

You are the trash of the team.  Without you, your team is exactly in the same position as they were.  Roaming as a soldier requires a lot of analysis of the situation.  If you rocket jump first, and ask questions later, you probably find yourself as a pile of giblets far too often.  Before you decide you want to bomb an enemy team, consider the questions:  Can I kill a high value target?  Can I force an ubercharge?  Will I be dead before I hit the ground?
*****
## Matchups

##Scout

The spastic twit.  Know that at a longer range, you are relatively safe from the scout, even if he is spamming at you all day.  If this is the case, laugh at the feeble attempt to do ~30 damage to you, and wait for your move.  At extremely close ranges, know that the scout is at a severe disadvantage to your rockets.  If the scout can jump off of tall objects, predict which tall object he will land on **next** and aim for it, don't try anything high risk like random airshots.

##Soldier

Where's all that MGE training gone to?  If you are at mid-range, trade rockets with the enemy.  If you feel like you have gained a solid advantage, move for the kill.  If things aren't going hot, get a buddy to cover and fall back.  You shouldn't commit directly to a fight that will have a 50/50 outcome.

##Pyro

Only shoot rockets after you have been airblasted.  Shotguns are fine too.  The first rocket will be a mindgame with the pyro, and know that he has trained to wait just long enough, so don't think it's time to shoot until he HAS PUSHED YOU BACK or has switched to the axe for the chop.

##Demoman

Terrain determines everything.  If you are relatively close, or have a clear jump path onto the demoman, go for it.  If the demo is using stickies, remember that he is trying to lead you with shots.  All you have to do is learn how to become un-leadable.  Try to be very unpredictable, so he cannot land shots easily.  If you decided you want to run away, running directly away is usually a terrible idea, as he will start to shoot ahead of you, so this would be a good time to juke to different directions.

##Heavy

Never engage head-on unless you have a clear advantage: he's almost dead, out of ammo, sandviching, disconnected.  Elsewise, coordinate with teammates to bring him down via focus fire.  If you try and 1v1, or bomb a heavy, you will die, and it will suck.

##Engineer

In most situations, the sentry will be dealt with by an ubercharged demoman, who can do a much better job at dispatching of the threat.  However if you must, then apply rockets to sentry until sentry is deconstructed.

##Medic

Go crazy.  Easy stuff, but know that if he is running ubersaw, you do not want to give him free swipes.

##Sniper

Sight lines will suck.  Don't give him sight lines to shoot at you.  Preemptive planning will get you around every potentially disasterous encounter.  Short range needs no explanation.

##Spy

Spy is all preemptive planning as well.  If you give a spy no chances to backstab you, you will have no problems.
*****
##Loadouts

For 6v6, stick to the Rocket Launcher, shotgun or gunboats, and Escape plan.

For HL, the disciplinary action(whip) is a valuable tool if you can coordinate with it.  I strongly advise running it for rollouts, and after the initial fight, you can consider the escape plan as an alternative.  If you run the whip, when you are dead, look at teammates respawn times.  Ask anyone coming up with you to stay with you to whip, or else they will outrun you after a few slaps.

Additional HL toys to consider are the black box, for playing as a far roaming soldier, allowing the other roamers access to health packs and the cow mangler 5k, which brings most of the firepower of the RL, and does give you some unique ranged sapping power.
*****
## Practice and Refinement

Playing a soldier is very straightforward.  We shoot rockets and blow people up.  My recommendations for soldier DM-practice would be:

* MGE
* Pubs
* Pugs
* Shotgun heavy

I recommend shotgun heavy for one main fact.  The slower your class is, the more you rely on wrist-movement to aim.  If you practice aim with a 100% speed class like the engineer, you aren't getting the same flavor of aim as you would with our big tubby friend.

Also note that airshots are not a massive part to soldier play.  Sure, when you land them, you deal free damage to flying enemies, but in the end, having an incredibly soldier ground-based DM is much more important, as it is the standard method of combat you will see.
*****
##Improving gamesense

The quickest way to knowing what you did wrong is examining it.  Most people will tell you to record a demo, and then watch it while you have your pen and paper out, and get to analyzing what you did wrong.  The problem I find with this is **I'd rather be blowing up more people than watching my glorious past self do it.**

With this note, I recommend the following:

* Play as you normally do
* Die as you rarely do
* While dead, consider why you are dead
* Did you do something wrong that lead to this?
* Could you have done something different?

Reflecting on the past life is much easier, and much less time consuming than watching a full game twice.  Also, understanding what happened right then leaves the actions fresh in your brain, and makes use of the boring respawn timers anyways.
*****
## Rocket Jumping

Rocket jumping is a part of the soldier culture.  The first three things a soldier learns are how to shoot a rocket, how to fight a grizzly bear with his bear hands, and how to rocket jump.

However, the actual importance of rocket jumping is not as steep as one might first think.  If you can jump to the spire in badlands, or the crates in granary, or C point of gravelpit, then you win.  No more jumping is required.  Everything else is flashy and rarely required.

Double however, learning how to rocket jump makes you a complete and total badass, and I recommend trying out some jump maps whenever you get tired of blowing up baby men.

*****
## Rollouts

Obviously only a big deal on 6v6 maps, but:

* Learn the quick route from the pros
* Practice these routes
* If you aren't comfortable with a jump, don't try it during a live match",,False,,t5_2stfn,1343855977.0,,flair-soldier,True,t3_xiwd9,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/xiwd9/an_indepth_competitive_soldier_guideread_rambling/,

Just please don't use it.  It's very possible a Demoman could be crouching on those barrels and shooting a sticky, and the next thing he knows he's invincible.  Naturally you're limited because you can't access ammunition anyways.  

The UGC mods ARE aware of this glitch and have ruled it **""definitely illegal, it's much worse than the Steel Pyro bug"".**

The Swiftwater map will get a fix after this week's game.

You're the one who've kept the quality of discussion to such a high standard. And for that, I'd like to thank all of you. 

But we all know about the problems with a growing community, so let's work together to keep the standard of posts and submissions at a high quality. This shouldn't put you off introducing new people to TrueTF2 - we need new faces to develop and grow - but it is something to keep in mind when you're about to hit that submit button.

We are playing CP_Steel this week (as most should know) and there is a glitch involving the A to E connector door ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMoB-dql-hE)).


This was used against us, causing us to lose a sentry nest, ***TWO*** ubers, and essentially losing us A in record time. (This is what I was told)

In our game:

The enemy team had full knowledge of this (engineer had a teleporter for the pyro for this purpose), so we call in the a UGC admin (Sylon) and after further discussion, he said this exploit was allowed.

At this point, my team flips their shit, and start arguing with each other.

As per UGC rules:

9.2 Map &amp; Game Engine Exploits The intentional use of exploits of map flaws and game engine bugs is not allowed. 9.2a. Texture flaws. Players are not allowed to use any map texture flaw to their advantage, including but not limited to; player clipping off map, placing SG's or other constructs off map, placing explosives of any kind in texture flaws, **shooting thru a flawed prop or door** (What's with the spelling?...). If you have any questions about a particular in-game action or tactic, ask Admins before using it in a match.

Will upload our STV demo later after I get it.

[STV Demo](http://tf2demos.com/demo/1331007179/slk-vs-ff) :: Relevant tick is 400,000 (actual exploit roughly 10k ticks after, but it's better to start at 400k because it's near the end of the demo; we paused right after and it cut the demo off)

[Video of the point](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64sa38ZOuQU&amp;feature=youtu.be)

So, my question to truetf2 is:

How is this, in any way, allowed, and in good sportmanship.

Also, I was not directly affected, so I'm just a messenger; don't shoot me.

Today, I come to you about the topic of where items were, where they are now, and what to expect of them in the future.

We start our text based journey long ago, back when we had nothing but nine classes, no items, and dare I say, no hats.  April 29th, 2008 rolls around, and the first unlocks are released for the medic.  Shortly after comes the pyro update, and then a heavy update.

Between these 3 updates we are issued a total of 9 new toys to play with, most being released to counter a specific flaw in the gameplay of their respective classes.  The medic's ubercharge was too easy to run away from.  To solve this problem comes kritzkrieg, now you can easily mow down anyone, but at the price of being very vulnerable.  The pyro's short range hampered his(its?) power to deal with enemies at a distance, so here comes the flare gun to create long range openings, but reduce his mid-range capabilities.  The heavy's stupidly huge health bar could be a detriment between fights, meaning he could not hold the fort on his own.  Here comes the sandvich, healing 120 HP per snack break, unthrowable, and re-eatable.  Now the heavy can have short meals to help is big-man health bar, and can take the munching time to be ready between fights.  The sniper is a class that is hard to properly deal with, because often there wasn't much you could do to combat him, or play the matchup right, especially if he has a long distance advantage on you.  Later came the huntsman and jarate for the sniper, designed to bring the sniper closer to the fights, and give you a better chance at direct dealing with him.



All of these weapons were designed specifically for making the game flow better, patching holes in some of the mechanics, while offering different downsides to balance them out.  Today, we have weapons that have a designed model first, followed by random stat assignment to make them have a different feel from primary weapons, usually being a +x% stat, and -y% stat to compensate, which often will get plugged into a ""will this help me out more in most situations"" question, and then the future of the weapon is determined, either an always on, or always off item.

Bearing in mind that some items CAN break this formula, I'd love to hear the opinions of everyone here on this topic.",,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,flair-soldier,True,t3_vzc26,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/vzc26/tf2_items_then_and_now/,

##Introduction

Hello thar!  My name is Frank, and I'll be your tour guide on our adventure to proper communication in a competitive environment.  Before we even begin this section, know that I expect you to have some sort of VoiP(Voice over IP) program to properly talk to your team, whether this be mumble, skype, or even the in-game voice chat.
*****
##What is communication?

On a most basic level, communication is what I am doing to you right now.  Yes that's right, I'm doing it all over you, and there's nothing you can do about it.  Even now, you are compelled to continue to let me do it.

Communication is a means to convey information to and from your team.  This should primarily be done via a VoiP system as mentioned in the introduction, but spans further with things like in-game binds, and even pushing the Medic! button.
*****
##Why is communication important?

Communication is required so that we can distinguish ourselves from cavemen.  Without a form of communication, you might as well don a Flintstone-esque visage and show the prettiest stone-age woman a form of affection, by clubbing her and dragging her back to your cave.

Have you ever tried to go for a sweet frag video clip on top of 4 enemy players, and wound up doing boatloads of damage to every single one, but without a single kill?  Well, this is the time to start communicating.  Actually, ten seconds ago was when you should have started, but I'm not asking you to time travel here.  Communication can help your team play as a team, considering your team is playing a team-based game that is called Team Teamtress Team.
*****
##Transitioning from pub to competitive

The easiest way to make a transition from pub to competitive in the communications department is simple.  Find a friend or two, or coerce some people via large wads of cash, to play a typical pub game of TF2 with you.  While you play, play as a pack:  Let everyone know almost everything that is happening(note: the almost is for things that probably are not appropriate to tell them, like what color underwear you are wearing, and if your grandma is on fire).  Simple communication practice like this will bring you a large step closer to the behemoth that is competitive communications.
*****
##Good communication habits

The best habit to communicate is to make it a habit to communicate.  Start swirling down that rabithole for a moment darling, I will give you some time.

Ok time is up.  Time for some actual tips on communicating information.  Also understand that this is a generalist role, and will not always apply for every class.

* Current uber%, estimation of enemy% or who has advantage
* BEFORE you make an attempt to suicide pick on a high value target
* When you have dealt massive damage to a single target
* When you see a push coming in
* When you see the enemy falling back
* Oddities(ex offclassing in 6s, enemies running unexpected weapons like direct hit or kritzkrieg)
* Any class killed

* **How does it work?**

All C-Script is is a variation of the ""record"" command with a few extra bells and whistles for convenience. It will generate three demos in any given situation; one for the first half of your match, and then, if needed, one for the second half, and, a final one for extra time.

* **Why is this better than P-REC?**

**It's not**. It's merely intended as a replacement that does not require plugins or file customisation. The good news is that C-Script will never break unless Valve makes significant changes to the demo system.

* **How do I use it?**

Match starting? Press F1. First half finished? Press F1! Second half? Guess what, press F1! When that's finished, press F1! Extra time? Press F1!

Then, close TF2. I could have included a recurring bind such that you press F1 again to start a new recording, but I figured it's far simpler to have people close TF2. In addition, this stops you spamming the button and overwriting your recordings by mistake.

Move the files ""match_firsthalf"", ""match_secondhalf"", and ""match_bonusround"" out of your TF folder. C-Script will overwrite these if you start a new session without doing so!

It can light enemies on fire, put out your friends, reflect rockets and bombs, and most importantly, it can actually kill things. Even the Degreaser can actually kill things.

Most Pyros I've encountered seem to use the degreaser for one purpose. Igniting, then puffing. Then they swap to Shotty or Axtinguisher and use it to finish off their opponent. But, the Degreaser or any flamethrower can kill opponents, you just have to hold down the fire button for a moment!
Back when TF2 was made, that was the standard method of killing an opponent with pyro, there wasn't airblast or the axtinguisher.
Just the Flamethrower, Shotgun, and Fire Axe.


So, my fellow Pyros: Try holding the mouse button down for a second or two when using the flamethrower! You'll roast your enemies right back into respawn, and might even get more kills. Remember, without the Flamethrower, you're a fat scout.

TL;DR: Hold down M1 for more than a fraction of a second when using the flamethrower, and watch as enemies actually burn to death. But remember, after you're done holding M1 for a second, shoot them with your Secondary.
Or axtinguish them if they're in range. This helps a lot in dealing with scouts and other cowardly classes that run away.",,False,,t5_2stfn,True,,,True,t3_qgywn,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/qgywn/on_the_proper_use_of_flamethrowers_a_guide/,

1362330470.0,58,self.truetf2,19kzns,On mentoring **bad** players. Snowflake story inside.,FrutBaskins663,74,16,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/19kzns/on_mentoring_bad_players_snowflake_story_inside/,"Hello all,

I wanted to share an issue I had a few months ago, and get some input from my fellow players out there. Especially from those who have experience mentoring a player. This happened some time around November of 2012. I wrote the story below, but never got around to posting it here in reddit.

A little bit about me: Playing 4 years now, I play in UGC highlander mostly as a sniper in an upper-level division, but I also play other classes such as engineer and pyro. I'd like to remain anonymous so I am posting this under a throwaway account.

I took on a role as a mentor to a player who's never played competitive but interested in highlander, so I taught him a few things and made him into a better player. Much to my dismay, he's created a lot of problems for me that is just making playing it painful for me to play the game.

----------------------------

**The story:** 

Two weeks ago, I was in an svs *(Sniper vs Sniper)* server, pretty much just playing with friends. It's a headshot-only server, so the ones who are up to no good like cabering demos or engies who place level 3 sentry at spawn have no reason to go there. There's a higher skill standard, basically. But that day, a newbie sniper, let's call him **Newb**, joined the server. Obviously at the end of a 15-minute round he bottom-fragged, earning less than a dozen kills while some of us were pretty close to 200.

As some snipers who frequent these servers know, it s easy to distinguish between the regulars and the newbies by observing their style of play. Newb was the one who would sit around the corner, crouched down, and get an occasional headshot every couple minutes, which is pretty much a fraction of what a normal player gets in that timespan. It was obvious he did not have much experience playing in the servers.

Throughout the match he asked for tips. No one really answered. Occasionally someone would give a tip or two but the surprisingly good thing about it all was that no one was being mean to him. After the match, he added me as a friend and we talked. I knew he was going to ask for tips, so I happily shared some. I was in his shoes before, and had the luxury of learning from a great sniper when all I had to do was ask. So I figured there was no problem trying to do the same (not implying I'm great or anything).

Fast forward a week later, he's no longer the newbie who cornersnipes in svs. He went from 40 hours as a sniper to around 55, but those 15 hours of training I'd say made him exponentially better than he previously was. However, there are some problems I've been repeatedly pointing out to him. These are the two most prominent ones:


1. **He's been challenging people left and right, and when he loses, he tries to get me to come to the server and beat the guy for him.**

I find this to be juvenile, and as he's only 16 years old I figured it's unwarranted behavior.  I tried to make him realize that MGE should primarily be used to practice and to try out new things, but all he seems to care about is playing to win, padding his rating/stats and showing those who kicked his ass in the past who's the boss. 

I've emphasized the pointlessness of the whole thing, and to instead just practice. 2 hours spent practicing is better than 2 hours spent going around challenging people, but I also know well enough that this is his prerogative and that I should not have to keep reminding him. He's been trapped in the svs-mindset, similar to how some people learn bad habits in MGE.

I've tried to tell him these things but he doesn't seem to listen :(.

2. **He tries to drag me into a problem of his, sniper clan drama-related.**

Those who've seen it know it can get pretty serious :(. Apparently, when he's just started playing the game he thought he was a beast sniper and tried to challenge players in a sniper group whose name I would rather not mention. Obviously he got his ass kicked. I found it funny how he stumbled upon a clan of skilled snipers, and thought he must have provoked them in some way because they would normally have no reason to entertain him in the first place. 

I understand there's hundreds of invite-only groups out there, but this one is a 3-letter tag that begins with an N. I didn't know about this problem of his prior to helping him become a better sniper, but now every time he's around an N-player, he'd ask, *""Do you know ***[**insert my name here**]***? Can you beat him in 1v1?""*.

Some of these guys are my friends and know the situation, but others think I'm trying to start some drama, which I'm really, honest to god not. I've repeatedly asked him not to do this, but I feel uneasy every time he sends me an invite to an mge server with a bunch of N-guys in it.

To make matters worse, he's beaten some of the less-skilled snipers in the group. And it's making him (and to a certain level, me) look bad. I tried to tell Newb that just because he won in a duel/MGE doesn't mean he's automatically better than the person who lost to him. Some of these snipers who lost to him play competitive so I told him there's more to sniping than svs. His response: *""I only care about svs, join a top clan and be the best""*.

As ridiculous as it sounds, his response makes me very sad because I thought he was trying to get better so he can do well in HL. I feel I went about this whole mentoring thing all wrong. Having helped a few people in the past the same way without any problems, I can only say that maybe I haven't helped him enough, or I helped him too much.

------------------------------

In retrospect I regret lending a hand to this guy. I'm proud of the fact that I changed him in a week from a crouch-walking, cornersniping Newb to someone who now has a general idea on how to get better as a player. When I asked a friend for advice, all he said was, ""This is what happens when you help someone who doesn't need to be helped"". I think I now understand what that means.

I also knew it would be a thankless job, helping a stranger get better, but I did not know it would have this sort of negative, distressing effect on me.

I think the best course of action for me right now is to start creating distance. I've given him lots of resources for getting better and he should be able to use those resources as he sees fit. I also managed to get him into a backup slot for an Iron team so if things go well, he'll be playing next season. I think it's all I can really do for him without any more problems going my way.

----------------------------

Fast forward to present time, I've had very little contact with him. He's now a member of the clan whose members he hated so much. His Iron team, which was supposed to start this season, could not get enough members and will not be playing this season, unfortunately.

//Fake Reloader

bind ""MOUSE3"" +fakeswitch

alias +fakeswitch ""slot1;+reload""

alias -fakeswitch ""-reload;slot3""


HOW TO USE:

1. Start off by having a revolver that actually needs to be reloaded. The best way to find one of these is to trade with another spy who has already fired their gun that round.

2. Disguise yourself.

3. Hold MOUSE3 (or whatever key you bind) to switch to revolver and begin reloading. Hold it until you hear the first click of the revolver's reload. Don't hold too long or you'll complete the animation (which will obviously fill your revolver clip). 

4. Releasing MOUSE3 switches to your knife, cancelling the reload. Rinse and repeat to help your illusions of retreating soldiers, scouts, engies, &lt;anyone who has to reload one projectile at a time&gt;. 


NOTES: I doubt it looks incredibly smooth, and I doubt it would be useful at all in higher-level play; but I bet it will fool at least ONE person if you pub all night. They will probably say something like, ""haha nice reloading soljer u put all the rockits in ur gun!"" And when you see that, I hope you nod in satisfaction as you harmlessly butterknife him in the face and get blown to bits. 


The extent of my testing was going onto a trade server and getting someone on the other team to tell me if it looked legit or not, so if it doesn't work at all, don't be too shocked.

---

Now, most of us don't touch SPUF, but there's been some interesting [discussion on the pyro in 6s](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2788263) there.

&gt; Hello, this is bloodsire, I would like to say that I think pyro is fine for 6's and can do reasonably well in the hands of the right person, just like sniper, and to a lesser extent spy.

&gt; The main reason you don't see pyros is because 6v6 is not a game of class vs class like highlander is (which is great for highlander). 6v6 is more engine based than class based. By that I mean in 6v6 you see which 6 players can best another 6 based on their skill within the game using all the tools available to them under the given rule-set. The short point there is that pyro is a tool, useful and handy in the right hands, but likely not the best tool to be used in most moments.

&gt; Nevertheless, the other main reason pyro is not seen is because teams and players are afraid (though not so dramatic as that sounds) of venturing into the possibilities of what a pyro can do.

&gt; Personally I think the pyro is perfectly equipped to function in 6v6 now more than ever. This is why when I need to backup for LG I try to use the class as much as I can before they yell at me to stop ""goofing off."" When I made ""meet the proro2"" there was no flare crit and no degreaser—and thus no faster reflect. Also (and this is the main advantage of the weapon imo) there was no fast weapon switch.

&gt; You need to micro-manage all 3 weapons very efficiently on pyro and the degreaser makes this possible. This is important because you do not need to puff, airblast, and then axe kill anymore—which sometimes led to you pushing the target away from melee range. Now you can just puff and switch almost in the same keystroke and land the axekill.

&gt; This all leads up to the biggest advantage pyro now has, and that is the full flare crit on burning players, adding in a whole new series of combos for pyros to use. You can literally snipe with pyro, pull off excellent airshots, and DM players who might be hurt. You can choose to light them on fire, then push them in the air and crit flare them, or push them into a corner and axe them, or flare them once from far away and then flare them again to crit kill them (all while having enough time to switch back to the degreaser and protect yourself with the airblast). This has major influences on how a team can move around the map if their players are being flared, pushed, and spammed with their own spam (see LG gpit match vs spacewhales).



&gt; Point is, pyro is fine. Players just need to learn more about all the variables, and teams need to learn more about how often a capable pyro can help. It will take someone to come master flare accuracy like demos master pipe accuracy, for pyro to truly be useful (just look at how effective I can occasionally make it just by spamming flare in the enemies direction and hoping they get hit). 

And some somewhat similar thoughts echoed by tyrone:

&gt; I skimmed through this thread and wanted to put in my input. If you pull it off successfully, why not, there is nothing stated that you cannot run pyro full time, heck, I know some incredible players that can play pyro at ridiculous levels, easily making it a viable class in pick up games and such. At the top levels it doesn't seem to work because no team has truly committed to that approach. If a pyro is used, I think the class make up structure would change a bit, you would maybe have him pocket with a scout, and have the soldier demo roam. (I'm purely theorycrafting at this point) I don't think pyro is being used to its fullest abilities, I think they have incredible potential, its just not being unlocked in 6's due to the 'utility' stigma and players being more comfortable on the cookie cutter classes.

Bored of the default waves? Make your own. Want to play against a million spies? Go for it. Sadly as far as I know there's no way to randomize  or loop anything so you can't do infinite-wave random-mob mode (but you can copy-paste stuff and have a trillion waves, so close enough).

First off download [GCFScape](http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=26), open 'team fortress 2 content.gcf' in your steamapps folder and extract tf/scripts/population to your regular TF2 folder. It should retain the same folder structure. So steamapps/username/team fortress 2/tf/scripts/population. Make a backup of all these files as well. 

So open mvm_mannworks.pop in your favorite text editor. Scroll down to wave 1, and inside you'll see there a bunch of mini-waves that start with WaveSpawn. First off it'll throw 12 soldiers at you total (**TotalCount**),  in groups of 6 (**SpawnCount**) and if there are 10 out already it won't spawn any more (**MaxActive**). If you just wanted to fight a million soldiers change all those variables to 982345 or something and have fun. If you want to change them all to heavies go into **TFBot {...** and change the **Class** variable from Soldier to Heavy.

_______________________

Now we gon' get fancy. Let's say you hate yourself and want to fight 5 Giant Rapid Fire Soldiers at the same time. Let's also say you also think they don't fire quite fast enough. However, you don't want later waves to use the insane-rapid fire soldiers, just this wave. Open robot_giant.pop and find his bot definitions. In this case he's called **T_TFBot_Giant_Soldier_Spammer**. Copy+paste the whole chunk of code, and rename it **T_TFBot_Minigun_Rockets**, because he's practically gonna be shooting rockets as fast as a minigun. Change the **Name** field to whatever you want to show up in-game. Head down to **fire rate bonus** and see that it's 0.5. That means he's firing at twice his normal rate, or the gap between shots is 0.5 as long as normal. Let's change that to 0.1. Now we have our very own robot that fires super fast and is an entirely different entity than the original Soldier Spammer.

Head back over to the Mannworks pop file. Erase everything inside the **TFBot** brackets (Class, Skill, WeaponRestrictions). In their place type **Template T_TFBot_Minigun_Rockets** and change **TotalCount**, **SpawnActive**, and **MaxActive** to 5. Bam!

Now you play a bit and decide that wasn't hard enough. You think what they really need is a bunch of uber medics, two medics per soldier. Right after the first **TFBot** section add two identical ones, but this time type **Template T_TFBot_Medic_QuickUber** in each. Now enclose all three TFBot sections in a **Squad {...}** tag so it looks like this:

    Squad
    {
      TFBot
      {
        Template T_TFBot_Minigun_Rockets
      }
      TFBot
      {
        Template T_TFBot_Medic_QuickUber
      }
      TFBot
      {
        Template T_TFBot_Medic_QuickUber
      }
    }

Awesome, now we have two ubering medics who will stay attached to your giant soldier. Now I want to send them out one at a time every 7 seconds. We just have to do some quick fixes to earlier variables and we're all good. **TotalCount** to 15, because we want five soldiers and ten medics, **SpawnCount** to 3 because we want three bots at a time, **MaxActive** to 15 because we want to send them out regardless of if the player has killed previous ones, and **WaitBetweenSpawns** to 7 because they are getting spawned every 7sec. Also, because we're so nice and this was a tough round, we'll give the players some more cash by changing **TotalCurrency** to 500 under WaveSpawn

_______________________

SO GOOD. Now instead of the default first wave being twelve soldiers, we are sending out 5 squads in 7 second intervals, each squad consisting of our very own Way-too-rapid Fire Soldier with 2 pocket medics.

I'm a devote fan of [Risus](http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/risus.htm), which gave me the general philosophy of this post. If you like pen-and-paper RPGs, give it a try)*

---

I'm a bit romantic when it comes to weapons in TF2. Whenever someone in /r/NewToTF2 asks, the answer is pretty much the same: *almost all weapons are sidegrades, a few are considered direct upgrades, some are no-no*

However, I like to think that all weapons are useful in their own right. Yes, I hate the average phlog pyro as much as you do, but I think the weapons themselves are not the problem. I like to think that all weapons are merely *refined* tools for a more particular playstyle, which is why all of them have some sort of upgrade and downgrade: to encourage certain actions and discourage others.

I think the problem for weapons like the Backburner, Phlog and many others that have a bad rap is mainly:

1. Their **intended** playstyle requires a certain level of skill, which *should* be acquired by playing with the stock weapon and somehow figuring out the particular strategy for the weapon (which involves more than just the weapon per se, e. g. trickstabs, puff-and-sting, etc.)
2. The rest of the community. This game, being specifically a team game means you're playing with and against other people and the way *they* play influences how *you* play. In a single round, it might be useful to switch between loadouts to respond to the particular situations that arise mid-gamer. Move this to a larger scale and (I think) patterns emerge in the whole TF2 community, which means the way the community plays effects how the community responds.

I don't think that the weapons are bad weapons *per se* but because of these two big reasons. Number 1 is why ""crutch"" weapons exist: you can use them before you have the skills and mental set for their *intended* use and then the playstyle defines the player, when it should be the other way around. When this happens, the player loses versatility (that is, enough skill to switch between playstyles according to the needs of the team with minimal ""losses"") We've all seen it: many pro players using the vanilla loadouts with one or two unlocks and switching depending on what the team needs.

Number 2 is hard(er) to prove, it's based on my intuition. I think that for many reasons, the ""undesirable"" weapons are psychologically linked to having lower skills (which in many cases in the Real TF2 community, it's true) and that has an effect on how others and you play.

There is a problem with overpowered weapons and I won't deny that, but that can be solved (and has been solved in some instances). I think that the real reason some weapons are regarded as ""crutch weapons"" and ""direct downgrades"" are mostly because of these two arguments.

Does this situation have a solution? Not that I can see, hence why I write this as a **tragedy**. I'd love to see all weapons treated and used equally all across the TF2 community, but it seems impossible right now (but, at least, that means we're having a relatively short supply of Caber Jumpers. Damn scots, they ruined Scotland!)

Not all special weapons are upgrades! Think about what weapon is best for your situation and maximize its effectiveness.

Basically saying, don't exclusively use unlocks as they can nerf you, but that's not to say they are useless.

    Tired of Lobbies?
    Want to try playing Highlander in a more organised setting where you can communicate with your teammates?
    Want to play with/against experienced players to improve your skills or just have some fun?

Well look no further than joining Europe's first ever HL pickup channel free for all to play. North America has two channels on Gamesurge (#tf2.pug.nahl AND #tf2.mix.nahl) but for Europe this is the first PUG channel we have had for 9v9.

To join in all you need to do is have an IRC client installed and join the Quakenet network, then join the channel - #tf2.pug.hl and !add &lt;class&gt;. You will also need mumble installed and to join the TF2pickup mumble (you can find it's address by typing !mumble in the IRC channel).

No idea what I am talking about? I have more information on ETF2L in this thread - http://etf2l.org/forum/community/topic-23803/page-1/

Also link to [IRC channel via Webchat](http://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=tf2.pug.hl)

Link to [downloading mumble](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/)

[Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/tf2pughl)

Rules are simple: Don't cheat, don't flame/troll, don't spam, don't rage and ruin other people's fun and use your mic. Joining mumble goes without saying, also try to join within 5 minutes of the game starting otherwise you may get restricted from playing for a period of time. if you can’t play remove yourself from the pickup and if the pickup starts and you can’t play, you need to find a sub for yourself as soon as possible, otherwise you will get a warning.

Thanks for reading, remember you're all welcome and the point is to have some fun.

1374609395.0,54,self.truetf2,1iwmp3,Pyro needs a new primary,Doomed,77,23,133,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1iwmp3/pyro_needs_a_new_primary/,"The degreaser is the [most heavily used](http://tf2stats.net/weapons/) pyro primary weapon. Why shouldn't it be? It's great in almost all situations. Ignite an enemy, airblast if you want, switch to flare gun, shotgun, or axtinguisher, then kill the enemy.

I don't have a clue how to go about creating a nerf for the degreaser, or if it even needs one. But I do think there should be another viable pyro primary weapon. Here are the play styles we can have now:

* Backburner - ambush from behind
* Degreaser - ignite then swap, airblast bad stuff
* Flame thrower - ignite?, airblast bad stuff
* Phlognosticator - ignite, heal, kill stuff

Of the four weapons, two reduce the ability to airblast and one reduces afterburn damage. Zero increase the ability to airblast and zero increase afterburn damage. I don't think the two should be combined in one weapon, but both would present interesting gameplay options.

An airblaster could have 250 or 300 ammo, but poor damage and afterburn damage. This pyro would be airblasting projectiles as well as igniting enemies, then switching to another weapon to finish them off. Similar gameplay to the degreaser, perhaps. Also this might be too overpowered.

An afterburner could do very little up-front damage, but burn for a long time and ramp up in how much afterburn damage it does on a single enemy. If playing against a competent medic, engineer (+ dispenser), or other pyro, then the afterburner's effectiveness is limited. But without those helpers, people would be scrambling for medkits because of how bad the damage becomes. (How long the fire burns, how much damage it does, etc.) edit: The afterburn flames should be extinguished upon the pyro's death, to prevent w+m1 suicide pyros.

Let's turn this around, how would you like to see what data used in what parts of the website? We can scrape team data from the etf2l and ugc websites, and can gather data from nearly every match played. How would you like to see what kind of data used?**

I'll clarify: in a similar vein to how tf2lobby does it, tf2center can scrape game events via the server logging system, being able to take fairly detailed data for every player (ie X kills Y, Z extinguishes A, spy B backstabbed medic C, dropping their uber. etc). 

If you had to pick certain class-wise metrics that could be used in the ranking system, how would you do it? What weightings would you give it?

Most of this will be based on the [elo rating system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) to actually give scores, so each player will be ranked relative to the performance of the corresponding class on the other team. pocket/roamer will be chosen before the beginning of the round (in terms of 6v6) so some leeway there may also be given in this sense. 

With this ranking, a number of things would be possible, including mouseover ratings for each player on the website, rank-locked games, a global rankings system and more.

So, what would you base it on? Some examples:

* For nealy all classes: medics dropped &gt; any other classes dropped

* Pyros, for instance, would have a bonus to killing enemy spies (and snipers dropped may be ignored altogether, since arguably a pyro shouldn't be roaming in typical PUGs)

* Medics would be given a bonus based on their ratio of ubers popped vs dropped, kills would be less emphasised upon, kill assists more emphasised.

So, any suggestions? 

Any suggestions as to whether we should even be using the elo system at all, and whether we should be using the [TrueSkill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueSkill) or [Glicko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system) rating systems (or any others) is also open to the floor.

How exactly is this newfangled league any different from your normal competitive leagues? Well, here's what exactly we're doing uniquely out of the gate:

* *Flexible Match Scheduling* - no week-by-week set schedule; just pick who, when, which maps, and go
* *Rating System* - be measured by how you're performing against other teams, not by what your win/loss record is
* *League-Provisioned Servers* - when it's time for a match, the league automatically sets up a server just for you with everything needed
* *Fresh New Postseason Take* - play against the teams that are really similar to you, not just similar in rank, for your shot at the championship

And that won't be all, we have much more we dream of and plan on doing!

We'm hoping to launch very, very soon (read: within a week or so), and we need you to discuss and figure out what you want this league to become.

*****
## What is a midfight?

Did you answer this question with ""Who doesn't know what a midfight is?""  Well guess what, you don't.  But first, let me explain how you are wrong before I then explain how I am right, and where you should direct your praise for me informing you.^1

The first thing to be concerned on the topic of a midfight is straightforward.  Any 5cp map and any KOTH map will always start up with a midfight.  Something that you probably did not think about, however, is pushing/holding last point of any 5cp map.  Sure, you probably think that because this point isn't the middle, that it shouldn't count, but here is something to consider:  A midfight is a situation where both teams will be battling over a single point, and both teams will(generally) be fighting with all of their men, in one large fight.  After this definition, you can see that a midfight, and a last fight can be incredibly similar, and now you can reflect on how your team that fails at midfights is also failing on last fights.

^1 ^Redirect ^all ^praise ^to ^comments ^below.
*****
## Why should I be concerned about a midfight?

I honestly can't even think of a joke for this topic.  You should damn-well know how important midfights are.  Especially if your team is having a rough time fighting for mid, and double especially for holding/pushing last, you understand that your team needs to make some changes that can have a massive impact on your match outcomes.
*****
## How can I prepare for a midfight?

Preparing for a midfight as a team requires communication.  If you have all of your plans laid out, this just means saying something simple like ""Let's go out xx""  or ""I'm going to go in from yy"".  Practice your rollouts as the explosive classes, and feel smug if you are the +forwarding classes.  Understand that playing as a team is incredibly vital on midfights, because if your team is split 50/50, and one half reaches a bulk of the entire enemy team, that half will be crushed quickly, and the other half will be forced to either fight at a loss, or give up and retreat.
*****
## What should I do during the midfight?

Let's break it down by class/arrival time:

##Demoman:

Arriving early?  Get out stickies and keep to your side.  Work to contain the enemies as they arrive.  Arriving late?  Ask your scouts to back you up.  Use your long range spam to deal damage, and call out any weak targets.

##Scouts:

Upon arrival: Is your demoman safe?  Push up and contain the enemy players.  Containing the enemy team is a key method to shutting them down at mid.  Is your demoman not safe?  Make him safe, abuse pistol range to try and injure enemy team and use your scattergun to defend against bombs/scouts.

##Soldier:

Welcome to the midfight, fatty.  Is your team doing exceptionally well in terms of damage output?  Bring the followup pain.  If not, keep your mid range rockets rolling and dish out constant damage as best as possible.  For the roaming soldier:  bombing shouldn't always be the first thing you do.  Throwing yourself into a situation where you probably won't get the medic, but will leave your team down a player, is a very risky situation.  Wait until you have a clear advantage before you go to dive for something crazy.

##Medic:

I think the healing/ubering part is pretty much understood already, and I won't delve into that topic.  Hit up your demoman on arrival, and if your roamer wants to dive, make sure you top him off.  Understand that standing incredibly near a choke-point gives you a false sense of security.  Sure, you can fall out very quickly, but it creates a situation where you HAVE to fall out as soon as you are attacked.  Support your team, and they will support you.
*****
##What are some outcomes to the midfight?

If your early players (demo, scouts) had a phenomenal fight, they have already won middle.  If they can secure kills/heavy damage, they can for their mirrors back into a choke situation, and effectively contain them outside of middle.  Alternatively, if your team loses players or gets hit hard early, you might want to consider backing out, as your team will be seriously disadvantaged, and trying to push back out of a choke that people are watching is suicide/ubercide.

If the midfight pans out slowly, both teams will act as massive blobs of spam throwers.  As spam is exchanged over a mid point, try to keep track of weakened players.  Sometimes, they will also show their injuries indirectly, like Escape Plan running, or bee lining towards a health pack.  Make calls when these events happen, and give your roaming soldier and scouts the go ahead to try and force the enemy team out or uber earlier than planned.  If your team is taking too much damage to sustain, consider leaving and hanging on to your uber/surviving players, as committing to a losing fight can mean losing not only mid, but also second.
*****
##How do last fights differ?

Well, there's a round on the line, idiot.  The big thing to note is that there is a last point, and it can be incredibly volatile.

Often, I see the attacking team blast their way towards the last point without regards to anything, and promptly getting wiped for maybe 1 kill.  This is(obviously) bad, and needs to change, so let's break down what needs to happen on a last-point offense:

What do we want to do?  Capture last.  How can we achieve this?  Getting men on the point.  How can this be done safely?  Kill people.  What's the easiest way to kill people?  When they are clumped up.

So, by diving your whole team onto last point, you are doing exactly what the enemy wants you to do.  Getting them to commit the same foul is often a great way to achieve victory.  This can be done by picking one or two players to be the designated ""bomb onto last"" people, thus drawing enemies towards the point.  Also note the spawn time for a defensive player on last.  If it is 15 seconds, that means you have exactly 15 seconds of time from the moment you kill your first enemy at last before you should seriously consider backing out and attempting the push again.

Defending last?  Read above, but backwards.  Let me know how that turns out for you too.

I had a player yelling ""Why are you pushing now?!"" with the same tone I would ask ""Why are there 5 spies on the team?!"" on a pub server.

There was a fair amount of backlash to this, which is why I'm seeking community feedback.

Now, it's clear that we need to discuss what is and isn't acceptable, because a number of different types of threads have been reported. I don't want to preemptively remove them, as I did in the past, as this was seen as a controversial move.

Here's a list of things that have been reported:

http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1h13p4/making_a_frag_movie_need_off_classing_demos/

http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1h0ip4/hales_own_servers_is_giving_away_2_20_slot_servers/

http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1gwak2/penguin_marches_badwater/

I'd like to know what the views of the community are on matters like this. Fragmovies and top 10 clips have been consistently reported, for example, but also receive plenty of upvotes.

Similarly, the Penguin Marches thread was reported, despite it being similar to the Moose Tracks series of videos which were well received by the community.

I'm also curious to know what an acceptable level of advertizing is. Wezlyyy and Hale's Own server providers have recently promoted their servers here. Competitive leagues also do a fair bit of posting in this subreddit. While not strictly to do with discussion, it's arguable that they do benefit the community at large, making their presence acceptable. 

Additionally, although they haven't been reported, I have removed mentor and scrim requests. Should they stay?

**Reminder**: Guys, don't just assume I know why things are being reported. If you're going to click the button, drop me a modmessage. It'll probably be removed faster that way as well. This goes for comments as well.

Today's lesson is on the metagame, or the meta of the metagame.  I promised I would try to avoid too many inception jokes, but it is what it is.

*****

##What is a metagame?

A metagame is, by straight defition, the game within the game.  By a definition that is actually understandable, it is how we use what we know about the game to better shape how we play the game.  Essentially it is us using our vast knowledge to shape and mold the most optimized level of play.  The best example is the extremely cookie cutter standard of 6v6 that we all know and love(and offclassers hate).

*****

##Things to understand about the metagame

I am going out on a limb here by saying the following:  The metagame has never once changed because someone came to /r/truetf2 and said ""I dislike this stale metagame.  How about we do X/Y/Z?

This is an important concept to understand.  Metagaming never changes because people want to ""shake up"" the meta.  It changes exclusively when a better answer is tried, tested, and proven to give a better outcome than the current solution.  

Sure, this means that to create and solidify a new metagame standard, you must play and test new ideas to see if they can stand up, but the key factor is that the people that do this are bringing in tons of time of trying, testing, and proving, of a new idea to the table, and then framing the meta around it.  The typical thought process from an outsider is backwards:  I want to think up a new meta, then prove how it is better, then try and test my claims.

*****

##Learning from other games

Metagame evolves most rapidly from games where having an optimal strategy are required.  Minecraft, for instance, is not a game where you have tons of options at your disposal that requires a strict adherence to a metagame to build the best house on the horizon(mine is the best, don't try and dispute).

On the other hand, MOBAs fit the meta mold perfectly because of their intense focus on winning vs other players directly.  For this example, we'll go with the only MOBA I know(and if anyone decides to mention any MOBA being better than any other in this thread, I will murder your family), which is League of Legends.  In LoL, there is a fairly strict metagame that has evolved.  It puts archetypical roles in the different positions based on how they can best use that position to their advantage.  In by no means is this metagame perfect, we see the pro players diverging from the system all the time go gain ground in specific situations.  It is important to note that by trying to switch around which champions go where, the emergence of a new metagame arises.

*****

##Rules and metagaming

Let me get this straight, the metagame and the rules of a league are entirely different.  In 6v6, the metagame is not only 2 of each class, 1 of X/Y/Z.  Those specifically are rules imposed by the league itself to spice up the gameplay.

A parallel can be drawn to something like basketball, where there was not originally a shot clock(your team must take a shot within 24 seconds of obtaining the ball.  This was done because once a team took the lead, they could just hug the ball in a corner and wait out the duration of a game, which isn't fun for anybody.

*****

##Highlander

Heyo my highlander homies.  Note number 1: Highlander has no **class** metagame.  It is by definition impossible to have a metagame where all 9 pieces are glued to the board, and you can't swap a pawn out for another queen.  This does not mean that highlander has no metagame, in fact, it just shifts the focus in another direction.

The entire metagame of highlander focuses on the positioning of the players, and the loadouts they use.  Positioning involves both where players get put(eg: keep medic out of sniper lines), to where the players get put in relation to each other(eg: heavy and medic work well together).  Positioning metagame is pretty solid and stagnant right now, but that isn't a problem.

Item metagame is the most evolving of the HL metagame.  With an increase in player size, variety of classes, and less strict weapon restrictions(this isn't a wrangler thread, don't make it one), different weapons show themselves as having possible uses.  The best example would have to put down on the black box.  It came to light with tons of scrims and games of testing and proving that this terrible-in-6s rocket launcher alternative could be so damned useful in highlander.

*****

##The Point

I didn't really have a point for this one, just a centralized place for discussion about the idea meta, not about the meta itself.  I guess this would also be a great link to send people to if you see them asking how the meta could get changed if we did (insert random idea that is probably bad here).",,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,flair-soldier,True,t3_1c2bmh,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1c2bmh/about_the_metagame_an_analysis_and_explanation/,

You're probably thinking to yourself ""Golly gee this will be so easy, I'll get that UGC medal in no time, right?""

**WRONG.**

Heavy is the second most important class in highlander (medic being the most important). Now before you close this page just read on to see why.

Heavy has one job, and that's protecting their medic.

Now that's a massive responsibility. Heavies need to ensure that their medic is well oiled and lubricated and have to ensure the safest route for your helpless little friend.

To do so you need to know your tools. The first two should be the only ones used and should never ever be changed as they provide the maximum amount of flexibility and support to your team.

**The Minigun:** Reliable, well rounded and perfect for every heavy.

**The Sandvich:** The one thing that makes medics love you more than anything. They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. This is entirely true. Now toss those things at your partner in crime. On another note, you can use these to quickly get other players back into the fight to alleviate the task of having your medic heal other players.

**Gloves of Running Urgently/Fists of Steel:** VARITATION, FINALLY! It boils down to personal preference. GRUs are a great tool for getting into battles sooner, and fists of steel can ensure that you come away from a fight with lots of health. Try them both out and see what you like more. Also discuss with your medic to see which one suits your combined play style more.

Before I go on further, let's talk about how the heavy protects the medic against the enemy classes.

**Spy:** Now you have your minigun revved and are currently unloading twelve tonnes of metal into the enemy's faces when suddenly you feel cold steel and a sharp pain in your back.
Heavies need to spycheck and know if the spy is behind them. Dying to spies shouldn't happen unless you've made a choice to die to one (for example: you know he is behind you but you want to get that last bit of damage off on the enemy heavy to ensure a easy clean up to for your team). If you're dying a lot to spies the solution is quite simply check your back more and have your medic do the same (as he is more free to look around).

**Snipers:** As a heavy you only have one way of dealing with these annoying Australians which is simply avoid them. Take a flanking route or call them out to ensure that your medic knows where he is to avoid him and so that your sniper (or other equivalent pick class) can take them out. If this is not an option, sometimes popping über is good way to ensure safe passage.
Medics: Really?

**Engineers:** Even if you are overhealed you can only really effectively take down sentries at close range, but you sacrifice tons of health by doing so. Demomen are much more suited for this role. (We will be discussing what to do when you aren't the pocket later in the guide.)

**Heavy:** This section boils down to simply who spun down first and who has the most support from their team. Once you have your minigun revved down you've committed to killing the heavy and unspinning your gun at that point is useless and stupid. If you think you're going to lose the gunfight, yell at your medic to run away before they can focus your med down too. I wrote that with the assumption that you couldn't hit their medic instead but if you have the choice to take on a heavy or his medic, focusing the medic is almost always the better choice.

**Demomen:** These sons of bitches are pains in the ass to deal with. Unless you have a straight shot at him you usually will be able to kill him before you do. However you will mostly have trouble dealing with demomen when they are around corners. Now, corners are a heavy's best friend, but if you're taking too much spam, the best way to deal with a demo is by retreating. If you think you're not taking too much fire and/or have über, then plough right through and go for gold.

**Pyro:** Heavy is a hard counter to pyro, but that doesn't mean these mutant freaks aren't a threat. They can easily hit your medic with their flames even if they aren't trying to. They also have to ability to airblast you into corners and then flare/shotgun/axetinguish you at will. It's very hard to hit them when you're  panicking and have no control over your already slow movement so I suggest getting a friend to get into an empty server and practice killing them as they airblast you into a corner so you can more fluidly deal with them in such a situation.

**Soldiers:** Because the soldier almost always takes the role of a roaming soldier in highlander, they will usually not be a threat. If they jump at you then simply shoot them out of the sky. I personally haven't had a problem with a jumping soldier kill my medic EVER. The only times that soldiers become a large threat are around corners. In that case deal with them the same way you would deal with a demoman in this case.

**Scout:** The mighty scattergun. Three shots and you're dead. Good scouts are a massive problem for the heavy as they can easily slip past you and two shot your medic. On top of this, they can avoid your bullets really easily and have their way with you. The best way to deal with this is to practice your aim. I managed to do this by playing scout in mge or deathmatch servers which helped my aim out a lot, and it helped me pick up a second class. Usually I wouldn't suggest playing one class to get better at another but this is one of those cases in which it actually worked (for me at least).

Now that you know how to deal with each class you get in game and... Oh no... Your medic wants to run kritz and pocket the demoman. Now what?

Simple. Your role hasn't changed a bit. You still stick with your medic and you ensure that they are not harmed. This is because demomen are really bad at protecting things, and are better off dealing damage. Also if your demoman dies, you're the second best target to kritz.

Finally, communication is the key to being an unstoppable force. Not talking is deadly in any situation, but talking too much can make other people miss out on what calls are being made or can impede them on hearing if a spy uncloaks or other audio cues.

Since you're constantly protecting and moving with the Medic, communication on when to push, dole out sandviches and when to retreat are more important than a lot of other aspects of communication with the team. It really helps your team to have a good bond between the Heavy and Medic, since you two are two of the most important players on your team.

Now you're ready to take on the world with all their dangers but remember that if your medic dies you're the only person to blame, and you should only blame yourself.

A while back (near enough to truetf2's birth), I was watching some top player POVs and I wanted to know what keys they were pressing when dodging and such.

I came up with this - http://www.reddit.com/r/teamfortress/comments/m0i9z/retrieve_button_presses_from_a_demo_file_with_tick/

However, that in itself wasn't all that useful because it required post-production and the output was in a text file or somesuch.

I just figured out another way that you can achieve something similar within tf2.

**You need these four console commands:**

* `developer 1`

 this spits out the console output in the top-left corner of your screen while playing / spectating (may vary depending on HUD of choice)

* `demo_debug 1`

 as explained in the linked post, this outputs everything that happens in the demo, include commands by the player

* `con_filter_enable 1`

 we want to be able to remove all the other junk from the console output about player deaths and unbounded objects and things

* `con_filter_text ""dem_consolecmd""`

 this will only show lines with player commands

As a result, you get **[something like this](http://i.imgur.com/K1fNC.png)**

The output format is [tick] dem_consolecmd [action][key]

I don't exactly know what numbering system the keys are using... they're not ASCII, at least, but they appear consistent. If anyone recognizes it, comment below.

Now if you're watching a particularly dexterous player, such as [Epsilon schocky](http://vanillatf2.org/demos/343), it's quite hard to follow along at 100% speed, so if you get to an especially interesting section, it's probably best to slow things down using demoui or whatever.

Frankly this is extremely nerdy and probably of little benefit, but more info to learn from can't hurt, eh?

you know that feeling, when you go to a game that you have so many hours on, and for some unknown reason you simply cannot aim like you used to just yesterday.
I sure do, but something that seems to fix it is muscle memory training maps.

I don't really understand what muscle memory is, but basically(I might be wrong), muscle memory training makes you repeat your mouse movement and the way our muscles get better are by grinding and repeating something.

download the map tr_aim_training_b13 http://tf2.gamebanana.com/maps/104304

there is a room there for muscle memory training, do the exercise at 0:30 in this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGtZhhyd85w

you do the training on all 3 distances[there are dots on the ground that mark them], you could listen to music in the background because it's boring.

that fixes any problems I have with aiming, and enhances my twitch aim!

I don't know anywhere near enough about the american scene to comment but I thought I should post it here.

**Update 1:**

We have something from the other side of the story, from Seanbud on [this thread.](http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/2409)


&gt;Slin... the amount of promotion I would or would not give my own channel during the weekend is unaffected by which channel we end up casting on. It's not like ESEA is going to sponsor me or something.

&gt;Please don't shit on me just because eXtine felt he had to. The extent of him ""talking to me"" was ""hey want to cast the LAN? djc/cbear and hopefully Lange are casting"" and I said ""sure."" That was about 2 weeks ago. I had very little knowledge of what went on behind the decision to cast the LAN on extv's channel rather than ESEA-Orange and I assumed it was because ESEA wasn't going to let them. When I found out that the opportunity to cast on the Orange stream was still there I was pretty pumped and I really didn't think it would cause any sort of drama or whatever. I'm kind of along for the ride so please stop the conspiracy theories about what I did to betray extine because this is the entirety of what went down:

&gt;djc: hey I think we're casting on the ESEA stream
seanbud: ok

&gt;So yeah. Lay off :&gt;

[original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tf2Scripts/comments/1cinu3/cfg_a_syntax_highlighter_for_tf2_scripting/)

Current Version: 1.1

---

**What it does:**

Using a syntax highlighter will change how certain text is displayed. 

cfg# changes commonly used commands to improve readability. 

Instead of [this](http://i.imgur.com/wYN5149.png), it will look like 
[this](http://i.imgur.com/mqtV3ar.png).

This is a big help when dealing with complicated scripts, as it becomes hard to distinguish between different multiple aliases, comments, etc.

[Another example of it in use](http://imgur.com/a/CATx4)

---

**Installation:** 

This works best with Notepad++. If you don't have it already, get it from [here](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.3.2.html).
 
First extract the cfg#.zip to an easily accessible place.

Next, open up a file with notepad++ and then click on ""*Define your language...*"" under the ""*Language*"" tab. Click ""*Import...*"" and then navigate to the cfg#.xml file in folder extracted from cfg#.zip. You should get a message saying ""*Import Successful.*"" Finally, restart Notepad++

**Using cfg#:**

1358435002.0,50,self.truetf2,16r5be,When should I use the Crusader's Crossbow for burst healing?,MisterChippy,54,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/16r5be/when_should_i_use_the_crusaders_crossbow_for/,"So I've been using the crossbow for a while now and I've realized that I can switch to my crossbow, shoot whoever I'm healing, then start healing them again and they'll have regained a bit more health than if I'd just kept the medigun trained on them, and I haven't lost all that much uber. In fact, from a purely mathematical standpoint, the Crossbow seems to heal more health overall than the QF, although it can only heal in bursts.

Now, I have a few questions about this:

#1: To actually get an advantage out of this, I have to forgo reloading the Crossbow and switch back to my Medigun as soon as I've fired. However, the Medic shouldn't really be fighting by himself anyways, so how much does this really matter?

#2: I have pretty good reflexes and aim with this weapon, so when a badly wounded Demo, Solly, or Heavy comes up to me in urgent need of healing I can normally whip out the Crossbow, shoot them, and get them back to the front lines much faster. However I'm not going to pretend I don't miss every now and then, and when I do I've wasted valuable time and haven't actually done anything. Even though I get the heals more often then not, is it worth the risk I might miss?

#3: During some rollouts (most notably Granary) I feel like I can help roamers get to the frontlines faster by shooting them after they've used up their buff without neglecting any other teammates. I don't miss when I do this since I know exactly where the roamer is going to be (although sometimes a Scout runs into the arrow) and I don't feel like I'm missing out on much uber. Is this a viable rollout strategy, or am I missing something here and just being stupid? 

#4: One of my favorite parts of the Crossbow is my ability to heal Soldiers using the Escape Plan. Now, I'm not dumb enough to do this to someone Equalizing to mid, but if I see a Solly anywhere else running along with the EP I'll shoot 'em. Are there any situations I should be aware of where this wouldn't be what the Solly wants? (I know the best answer is ""Ask him yourself."" but I'm not currently on a team so I can't always do that, so I just wanna know if there are any situations I should look out for.)

#5: Finally, going back to what I opened with, should I actually use that strategy when I'm pocketing somebody? I've saved at least one person who would have died from stickies with the normal healing rate using this, and I feel like I've used it to my advantage when I'm glued to a Heavy, but frankly I don't know for sure. I feel like it's a good idea, and the math makes sense, but I'm worried I'm missing something.

If anyone could get back to me on any of these points I'd be really grateful. ",,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,flair-medic,True,t3_16r5be,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/16r5be/when_should_i_use_the_crusaders_crossbow_for/,

Teams are randomly allocated into groups of four where they play in a round, the winner of the group stages progresses to a knock out round. 

Season Three was an awesome display of ragdolls and giblets with the EU division lovingly covered by [VanillaTF2](http://redd.it/qijym). Having an EU and an NA division meant there were two winners, but, in Highlander *there can only be one*, so when we held a [Final Showdown](http://i.imgur.com/OD54W.jpg), [eXtv](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRoundRobin/comments/rpd8v/in_case_you_missed_it_rrr3_final_showdown_match/) helped bring the pew pew to the masses and it was *glorious*.

Season Four with its 19 NA teams and 31 EU teams promises more blood, more ubers, more headshots, more pew pew, more giblets and more utter carnage. We've got some more experienced teams like Looking Handsome, Garage Gaming Fest and last season's NA winners Free Frag Network *offclassing* as their worst classes so if anything that should be *hilarious* to watch. 

As we have an NA team without a server [Kritzkast](http://www.kritzkast.com/) have been total bros and lent us a sever for play on Sunday! They're an awesome weekly TF2 podcast that you should be listening to. They're involved in some awesome stuff for the community like [TF2Mix-Up](http://tf2mixup.com/page/Donate) that pits celebrity against celebrity with a few community members in a for fun Highlander game. This year community members were picked through a donation raffle with all the money going to Child's Play.

We're in talks with casters at the moment, so fingers crossed for streams from eXtv &amp; VanillaTF2. Failing that each game should have a STV that will be made available before each game.

My first thought was that this might improve rollouts. One thing I've noticed is that when practising rollouts offline, I don't get the same feel as online as I am sometimes bumped away slightly from my stickies. A friend also noticed that some trick jumps might be made easier, such as the jump from gully upper second point to gully attic. He mentioned if he is with his pocket there, the pocket can bump him off.

Is it useful? Should it be added to competitive configs? Discuss.

Upon discovered that caster Salamancer(fatmop) and friend Yumi were both within a very short driving distance, we decided to go hang out in the name of justice.  After a lengthy conversation, we came up with a handful of ideas on how to improve the TF2 environment to create a more competitive e-sport based system.  The single idea I will be willing to share today was cleverly hidden within the title of this topic.

**Would glowing silhouettes around players, similar to the L4D series, make for a more visually appealing experience for casters and viewers alike?**

Things to note:

* Spectators/sourcetv only, so no actual gameplay is changed
* Toggleable so that visual clutter is not always in the way
* Silhouettes can change color as players are injured
* Would allow for flanks to be much easier noticed during a stalemate
* Fills in for a similar idea of a minimap to notice player positioning

First of all, thank you for being one of the friendliest TF2 communities I've ever encountered.  You're all eager and willing to learn about TF2 and help your fellow mercenaries.  Because of this, truetf2 is slowly becoming more and more recognized as a true forum for intelligent TF2 discussion.

Now, let's put all the jokes aside about how the new players have ruined the community and have a talk.  There are problems on both the upper and lower levels of TF2 and figuring out how to transition between them.  Lots of people are interested in getting better and playing competitive, but don't have access to the resources to do so.

We've had a few successes.  Notable is the [MGE Archive](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD098F81F2CA74F00&amp;feature=plcp) for players to understand the meta-game of each 6's class.  Experiment gave a [live tutoring session](http://www.twitch.tv/extvesports/b/307266653).  Reddit's gotten some love from high IM and Invite-level players.  Groups like eXtv and VanillaTF2, as well as other casting sites, are reaching deeper and deeper into the playerbase to get the word out.

Sadly, a lot of players feel like it isn't enough.  There's a large number of high-level players that are not very active with the community.  But are they obliged to be?

Long story short, what could be done to bring everyone closer together?

1375371505.0,48,self.truetf2,1jhzoi,Evaluating a pick and acting on it,LfbFrank,61,13,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1jhzoi/evaluating_a_pick_and_acting_on_it/,"Welp, work slowed down again and I've beat the ever-loving crap out of FTL so it's time to dig into my backlog of thoughts and get to typing.  Today, I'll elaborate on the point in a game where picks are important, and by picks I'm meaning the killing of targets, not about picking people for a team.
*****
Let's start with a thought experiment.  You and your highlander team are holding just outside of the enemy's final capture point on cp_Process.  Both medics are 100% on uber, both teams have all players alive and in good health.  Your engineer has a minisentry, L1 dispenser, and is currently working on a teleporter.  As the offender holding the enemy with their backs to the wall, you know you have the luxury of being able to take your time and wait for the opportune moment to strike, but when is that?

Today, we're going to take some time to examine this setup and see if we can draw some conclusions that lead to better choices and shot calling.
*****
First, imagine process last([or click here](http://forums.tf2maps.net/geek/gars/images/2/2/0/8/cp_process_b2_3.jpg)) and what classes you want to be utilizing in this situation.  It's gosh darned huge, so chances are your picks are coming from either your spy or sniper.  Since this is the case, you want to make sure your medic is keeping your sniper well healed so that he has less of a chance of dying, however it's not a huge problem because you have at least a level 1 teleporter, so if he dies he can get back fast enough.
*****
So your sniper gets a pick, what happens now?  Well, that depends entirely on who he can kill.  In general, the following classes don't warrant much of anything changing:

* Scout
* Soldier
* Spy
* Engineer

The reasoning is that most of them would not play a pivotal role in defense, and so the enemy team is not strongly hindered by this kill.  The upsides you can draw, however, are that:

* Scout: Backcap pressure relieved
* Soldier: Uber force pressure relieved
* Spy: Watching your back pressure relieved
* Engineer: If he had a level 3, it's on the house to kill, can possibly warrant a push but not necessarily by itself
*****
Obviously this leaves some classes who are worth it to kill, but what is important is interpreting what changes when specific classes get killed:

* Pyro: Your ubercharge won't get nullified at a choke.  You can also feel safe bringing in a solo ubercharge(ex: demo) meaning you can force a multi uber and win the war while easily escaping/bring in reinforcements when the ubers fade.
* Demo: Enemies' long range and AOE damage is severely limited, a head to head brawl is much easier now.  Additionally, no traps anywhere means all chokes are open to walk through(besides sniper fire).
* Heavy: The combo's close range damage is severely limited, after an uber exchange you can bring a close fight and hurt them bad or force them into spawn.
* Medic: Obviously a large blow, but there's more to it than an uncontested uber.  You also now have a team with overheals that aren't fading without a way to get them back up.  Additionally, a drawn out battle will either force enemies into spawn or be a victory for your team.  Importantly, this means you shouldn't get killed in this occasion, because your largest advantage is being able to heal after damage while the other team cannot.
* Sniper: While this won't signal an instant battle, it does allow a lot of things to happen.  You can now have your sniper stand in a doorway and take potshots at anything he wants, given he has backup(in this case I'd probably put one of: scout/soldier/engie to defend him), which can lead to another important pick and therefore a strong push chance.

It is important to note that gaining picks on multiple classes allow for an even wider array of choice.  Say for example you've picked their heavy and pyro.  Now you have the most dominant uber fight ever, but what is important to know is that chances are the opponent will now have a single target uber for the full 8 seconds, but afterwards you have an extreme advantage at close range.
*****
So what can we learn from all this?  It is important to realize that not all picks are created equal, and combinations of picks can lead to increasingly advantageous situations.  Always try to determine what classes make the largest impact on the situation, and act accordingly when you see their name appear in the upper right-hand corner of your screen.",,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,flair-soldier,True,t3_1jhzoi,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1jhzoi/evaluating_a_pick_and_acting_on_it/,

Okay, no problem, I airblast him into a corner so I can wait for his DR to expire and finish him off. Except then my teammates come along and all start shooting at him.

##Things to learn from this guide

In the end, the true goal from this guide is to better your positioning, game sense, and critical decisions.  Every pointer and tip will lead back to these pillars of competitive TF2, and will (hopefully) up your battlefield presence.  Do note that this guide cannot teach you how to aim, and every hour put into actually playing the class will translate into a better death match.
*****
##Mathyness!

This topic will cover a lot of mathstuffs, you have been warned.

* Maximum rocket launcher reload time: .92 + .8(3x) = 3.32s

* Maximum shotgun reload time: 1.0 + .5(5x) = 3.5s

* Maximum total reload: 6.82s

* Time it takes for a scout to kill you from full: .625(2x) = 1.25s

* How dead you will be if you empty both weapons: Very, very, very.

Things to note from this math example:

* Loaded weapons are important

* The scout *can* 2-shot you

* Never empty both weapons, unless desparate

* The best way to get more ammo is to blast a weapon on the ground towards yourself

*****
##Analyzing goals

What is a goal?  Well, longest story short, your goal is to win.

How do we win?  Capturing something, probably.

What can make this goal easier?  Killing enemies.

I will be one of few to say that killing people for the sake of killing people is *probably* a good thing.  Sure, your time might be better invested, but if you kill 4 enemies, I don't care what they were, you've helped your team progress, and there's not much anyone can say about that.

Please note, if your goal is to capture a point that is behind lots of scary enemies, rocket jumping over them is probably not the right choice.  Killing anything in your way will make your life a lot easier, and make your goal safer to achieve.

Always explode out your goal like the above.  Never just say ""well we need to capture their last point, let's fly into it gloriously"", that is how you die very quickly.  Consider how you can make the goal easier, and work on the plans at hand.
*****
##Commitment

I do.  Ok, not that kind of commitment.  Commitment is what happens when you have officially gone into a ""do or die"" mode.  This means that there is almost none to absolutely no chance of backing out of the fight.  Commitment is a very important topic at hand, as the soldier has a very easy method of engagement(rocket jumping), and not the greatest forms of disengagement(Rocket jumping again, escape plan, walking).

Consider whether committing to a fight will end well, or if your chances of achieving your goals will rise/fall based on your actions.  Alternatively, if you know the enemy team is weakened, out of ammo, or diagnosed with baby-syndrome, you should feel secure in committing, along with bringing the rest of your team into the fray.

Committing to a fight is something that should be considered hand in hand with your goals, and therefore you should reread the above topic, and make sure you have a thorough understanding of how one leads into the other.
*****
##Airshots?  Airshots.

Let's take a look at what an airshot is, what it means, and how it impacts your gameplay:

Positives:

* Looks awesome
* Shuts down a jumper, both by cancelling momentum, and with damage

Negatives:

* High miss chance
* Missing shots will reduce loaded ammo, and don't forget there is a big burly man flying at your face

So tallied up, when should airshots be performed?  Simple answer, ~~on tr_walkway~~ when you are fully loaded.  Whiffing an airshot when you have 4/4 rockets and 6/6 shotgun loaded is perfectly fine, you have buttloads of ammo ready to deal with when the jumper has landed.

What you really should not do is fire more than 1 air-attempt if you have missed, or are low on ammunition.  If the jumper lands in front of you, and you are now at 1/4 and 3/6, you are going to have a very bad time.

Debuffer/Buffer: These are those who use their abilities to help you take down giant robots. Defensive buffs are usually redundant, as you won't have difficulty taking damage from the Giants, but taking them down in time. Typically they'll use some form of minicrits which will make focus firing on a giant that much more effective.

Typical Debuffer/Buffers are:

* Scout, with a choice between Fan of War and Sandman for minicrits and Mad Milk as a slow/heal for the team

* Soldier, while running the Buff Banner (and you should avoid the other banners)

* Medic, while typically running the kritzkrieg, alternatively running the Medigun and sharing kritz canteens.

* Sniper, with Jarate and/or the Sydney Sleeper.

* Spy, disabling giants for your team.

Offensive force: These are your bread and butter of damage, you'll be using them for everything, killing giants, killing bots, killing everything. They are just good at what they do.

Typical Classses to fill this role are:

* Scout

* Soldier

* Pyro

* Demoman

* Heavy

* Engineer

Crowd Control: These are those that excel at making sure nothing gets past them, provided it's not a giant. They usually are offensive forces that have/avoid reload times without needing an upgrade.

Typical classes to fill this role are:

* Scout, while not necessarily being great at killing everybody until getting a penetration upgrade, is great at chasing down a surviving straggler, before they do something bad.

* Pyro, with health on kill and critical hits, you can wipe out a wave of weaker robots.

* Heavy, penetration will let you kill twice as many guys as you did before, stand in a choke point next to a dispenser, fire at will.

* Engineer, sentries always hit and can will take out most bots.

Utility: Also defined as useful and other. These classes will help you in the game a lot with specific abilities that other classes don't really have.

* Pyro: Airblast the bomb carrier into a pit to reset the bomb's distance. Airblast the bomb carrier into the trench and watch them walk the long way back. Airblast the bomb carrier to interrupt the dropping bomb animation, a Scout with the FaN can try to fill the same roll, but with no knockback upgrades for the FaN, best you can do is interrupt the dropping bomb animation. Heavy can also do some knockback with rage infused bullets, but the rage can be difficult to pull off in the heat of the moment.

* Engineer: Teleporters and Dispensers, a Dispenser with your heavy is a wall of bullets, teleporters will decrease the need to use buybacks as they can get to the frontlines quickly already.

With classes that can fit in multiple jobs, typically you will specialize in one. Debuffer scouts will focus on getting slow and recharge rate, rather than penetrating bullets. ",,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,flair-medic,True,t3_yixzw,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/yixzw/the_five_jobs_in_mvm/,

Alright, so it still isn't exactly an editor yet - but I've got the foundations for that done now. Yes, that's right, it can load and extract GCF files now (though the interface does not yet permit it) on *any* OS.

Also in the current version is the ability to modify caption files in the DAT format - once again, it works on every OS. Technically it supports adding and removing captions, though once again the interface does not allow for it. It can't tell you the key of *every* caption due to the way they are stored, but it can determine most of them.

And all of this in less than 2MB! (just under half of which is because of the background image, 250K for the svg and a png, 400K of windows filechooser natives, 200K of OSX UI improvements)

---

###Still to do (in roughly this order):

* VMT files. So many HUD elements use these, which in turn use VTF files. The canvas supports VTF loading already, but there just aren't many elements that use raw VTF files.
* Localization. I'm already loading most text from a file, so support for other languages is trivial.
* Proper multi-threading: you may notice the UI freeze at times when loading some HUD elements for the first time, don't worry, a fix is planned.
* The views menu - intended to load up pre-determined RES files and view them all at once in separate tabs. Includes custom views.
* Make use of the preferences panel.
* HUD installation for any HUD. Don't expect any fancy features though - it is meant to be an editor after all, and there are no standards for alternate file replacements.

---

###Known issues:

* The .desktop file on linux will most likely (unless you're me) point to nowhere on your system - the code also overwrites it. I need a dedicated install directory :(
* Report here if you find anything else significant or otherwise annoying.

---

###Updates

Future updates should automatically apply themselves.

* Fixed an issue windows users were having
* Increased logging verbosity
* Small interface changes for better compatibility

The goal of reverse tactics, or ticTacs as I have invented and am currently patenting so Apple can't sue me, is the idea that the best way to learn is from the perspective of the enemy.  We all know what our classes can do, and how to properly face off against other classes, but rarely do we look from the outside in, so here is our chance to do just that.

**Rules**

* Mention the class you play as
* Give a brief description of what you think a soldier can do vs your class
* Mention if this applies specifically to a roaming/pocket soldier
* Don't take my ideas without credit

Since I personally play soldier, I cannot give any examples, but here is the last thread that was ticTac'd: [The Scout](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/158bfp/reverse_tactics_scout/)",,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,flair-soldier,True,t3_15guz7,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/15guz7/reverse_tactics_soldier/,

Just going by the numbers, the stock grenade launcher is clearly a more reliable source of damage, both with direct hits and rollers. 

But the advantage in terms of damage isn't actually that high, even if we completely ignore the explosive damage of the cannon. Direct hits will do 100 damage at long range, about as much as the standard pipe. At point blank, it's only about half the amount, but it practically eliminates the risk of self-damage as well, and even if a roller hits yourself, it'll hit the ground first and do greatly reduced damage.

Long story short, Demo's finally got another close-range option besides melee. And the reverse ramp up, combined with the higher chance to get an the airburst damage at long range, turns it into a deadly precision tool.

The main feature, however, is still trading some raw force for additional knockback. Kind of similar to the force-a-nature, which beats the damage output of this weapon only at close range. And while it's not quite as good as the FaN at point blank, it's still better for dogfights than any alternatives.

Tl;dr:

The loose cannon can be considered the jack of all trades in terms of grenade launchers. If you're relying on your secondary to deal most of the damage, the cannon complements it well. It's not an airblast, but then again, you're not a pyro either, and the knockback alone is a very valuable asset.

I really don't like removing threads, nor do I enjoy telling people what can or cannot be posted.

That said, one of my duties as a mod is to enforce the rules of this subreddit to maintain its quality. In general, this means that threads should contribute some form of meaningful content - be it linking to an interesting external discussion, asking a question or providing guidance to the community. 

This brings me to the point of this thread: Server advertisements. We've had two in the space of about 24 hours, one of which I've removed until some kind of consensus can be formed on the topic.

Server ads do not, in their current presentation, provide any meaningful discussion. I expressed my views on this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/116n12/smatchmo_new_north_american_tf2_no_crits/), but some people responded by saying that *that* particular server ad was fine because it catered to the competitive-minded community that we have.

That seemed pretty reasonable. I thought about it and let it stay.

The problem I have with this attitude is that it sets a precedence for other server ads. The one I just removed was a *Halloween themed server*. And while I have no problem with someone trying to drum up a little attention for their server, I feel that a line should be drawn.

My current stance on the matter is that *all* server ads should be disallowed, as they run contrary to the overall goal of the subreddit - to foster discussion. While I'm not opposed to allowing some server ads, I feel that the line between what should and should not be allowed can often be blurry and might be a contentious point for server owners.

I'd like to know what you guys think.

**Just Do It.**  You will not regret this advice at all.  We're in the perfect time for you to get yourself on the market, find a team, and get the ride started.  **Approximately one month until UGC Season 10 kicks off.**

Playing TF2 with a competitive team makes **ALL** the difference.  Not only does it heighten the competition to amazing levels, but it gives you the great feeling of coordinating, playing, and learning with 5-8 other chums all in it for the same purposes.

I cannot begin to stress the camaraderie that is formed through such play.  Not only is your team going to become a strong friendship for you, but also the people that you meet and play against.  There's even a strong circle for a large portion of UGC platinum soldiers, because too often do you kill each other and have 15 seconds to talk about how awesome we are.

So in closing my truetf2ers, it is time.  It is time for you to get your butt in gear.  There are no excuses for not joining the war, and there is a team for everyone.  So what are you waiting for?  Go find a team, and begin the exciting life of competitive TF2.

I think I'll formulate another post on a lesser-discussed topic that's more thought out and not written in an hour or two.**

Greetings. I'm [Rusty Bodega](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/f/fb/Sniper_cheers07.wav), and aside from the fact that I should be studying for midterms, I thought I'd take a break and give a little insight about Snipers in Highlander. *[Remember folks, this is an open discussion. Feel free to put your own opinions in here, as I enjoy conversing about game theory.]* I'll also be editing this from time to time if good ideas arise in the thread, or I need to edit for grammar/science.

**First and foremost: ""Who the f### is Rusty Bodega?""**

* I'm a Sniper for the UGC Highlander team, [The Infamous Keyboard Surfers](http://www.ugcleague.com/team_page.cfm?clan_id=3562). Some of you may see me in Highlander lobbies, or possibly 6v6 lobbies when I play [Medic](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/f/f2/Medic_niceshot02.wav). I act like a dick sometimes. My hobbies include cooking and gardening. I also major in Exercise and Sport Science. 

**Secondly: ""Why would I want to listen to you?""**

1. Because you're part (or want to be part) of the circle-jerk that is Competitive TF2. 
* Because it's 2 A.M. and you've lost control of your life.
* Because you're a sadist and find that the pain becomes pleasure over time...


So what options do we have for secondary weapons? Let's take a look:

* **Submachine Gun** - *10 shots per second at a base damage of 8. (12 ramp up, 4 fall off.)*
* **Jarate** - *Applies mini-crit debuff, extinguishes flames on allies and self, and nullifies spy cloak. 20 second recharge. (Can be reflected.)*
* **Razorback** - *Nullifies a single backstab. Only recharged from a resupply locker.*
* **Darwin's Danger Shield** - *Increases max health by 25.*

Now for the discussion:

* **Submachine Gun**: Vanilla weapon. Decent for solo play (lone gunner), bad for teamwork. I use this in 6v6 since it's less chaotic, and mainly because Jarate is banned in most leagues.

* **Jarate**: What we're discussing, see below.

* **Razorback**: You'll get secretly mocked for using this in a Highlander game. Any Spy that has SOME experience in competitive can kill you with their gun no problem. At max health it takes 4 shots from a Revolver, and 2 with Ambassador if they land a headshot. It's not really worth it unless you roll in a group with your team, and at that point you'll be spammed with the constant splash damage so most of the time you can't aim anyway. Waste of a weapon slot in my opinion.

* **Darwin's Danger Shield**: Not really worth the extra health. A non-charge headshot still instantly kills you, and for the loss of the Submachine Gun/Jarate you're gaining 25 health to survive an extra millisecond.

**And for the moment you've all been waiting to flame me for...** 

Jarate is the 'Holy Grail' of Highlander play. Why do you want to equip this bad-larry and nothing else? Mini-crits, mini-crits EVERYWHERE. Insanely useful for pushing a point with your team, great for extinguishing fires, works wonders for decloaking spies, and all around the best secondary weapon for Highlander as a Sniper in terms of team utility (other than your ability to point and click people and make [da headshots](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/6/60/Sniper_specialcompleted37.wav).)

Oh yeah, let me bring up the fact that using the Bushwacka with Jarate is so broken I don't use it myself (and for another reason I'll bring up later.) Let me explain why:

* **Crits where it would normally mini-crit.**

Now take a look at the following equation:

* *Jarate + Bushwacka = 195 critical damage.*

This kills every class but the Soldier and Heavy in 1 hit (and if the Soldier took at least 5 damage, which is usually the case at any point in Highlander, they die.) The downfall of this weapon is 20% more fire vulnerability. Let's take a quick look at some numbers again:

    - Fire damage Without Bushwacka
       - Flare Gun = 30 Damage // 90 Damage if target on fire
       - Detonator = 30 Damage // ~41 Damage if target on fire
       - Afterburn = 6 Damage per second
    - Fire damage With Bushwacka
       - Flare Gun = 36 Damage // 108 Damage if target on fire
       - Detonator = 36 Damage // ~53 Damage if target on fire
       - Afterburn = ~7.2 Damage per second

As you can see, I didn't include the extra Flamethrower damage you take which can ultimately lead to your downfall much faster without the Pyro having to use a secondary or Axetinguisher. In a situation where I'm not very close to a health pack, I want to leave as soon as I can if I'm on fire (unless I have Jarate up.) **If you feel safe from Pyros, I'd say *use it*. Otherwise, Kukri works pretty well.** I generally try not to find myself in situations where I need to Jarate and melee a target that has more than 150 health.

Remember, **Highlander is not the same as 6v6**. You are relying heavily off teamwork, and Jarate is the best way as a Sniper to do so. Having an off-night? Jarate your face off. It's better to apply a constant debuff to the enemy team than to keep missing your shot.

That about ends it for this nightmare. I'll probably also edit this from time to time for the addition of more numbers and math. If I get enough positive feedback I'll do some more of these and make sure I don't half-ass it. If enough people hate it then you're saving me from wasting my free time (the power of adderall and caffeine...)^Don't^do^drugs.

1323883730.0,48,self.truetf2,nckru,On Afterburn,bamfusername,58,10,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/nckru/on_afterburn/,"We all know that the original intent of fire in TF2 was to create chaos. It was meant to be visible, visually noisy and obstructive, something to cause panic among players.

Naturally, this desired effect isn't as prominent today as it was about three years ago. People are more experienced and it's easier than ever to counter afterburn. It's easy for an experienced player to say 'Fire? Ha! I laugh in the face of pyros! I haven't died to afterburn in months!'

Simply put, afterburn isn't much of a killing tool anymore. Heck, we all probably know quite a few people who happily proclaim that afterburn is useless.

I beg to differ.

--------

A player who is actively taking damage is a player who wants to retreat. This is hardly the rule, especially with the equalizer and ullapool cabar, both of which promote suicide attacks. That said, in general, someone who is taking damage wants the damage to stop. The player will try and retreat to his own lines to heal up.

But why not just hit the player with a 60 (or 45) damage rocket? Isn't a rocket more reliable? Afterburn can be put out at any time, potentially reducing your damage over time. A rocket hit is a rocket hit.

The difference is that afterburn seems to have a greater impact than direct damage on *everyone*. Pub players and experienced comp players alike.

We all know that a player who is taking damage is more inclined to retreat. But whether they retreat isn't just affected by how much damage is dealt. It's also about how that damage is dealt.

People seem to dislike DoT more than spike damage. 

Spike damage has a single, obvious result: you take damage, your health drops by a certain number and you become weaker. However, you can still judge your survivability. You still maintain a certain amount of control over your situation.

A Scout with 125 HP would be reduced to 65 HP if he takes a 60 damage rocket, but *he is better able to react to the situation*. He can accurately assess the risk and say 'Hey. You know what? I think I can still take this soldier. I'm at medium range and I can still get in good damage. There's no need to retreat.' Alternatively, he can say 'Screw this, I'm bailing.'

Either way, regardless of the decision made, the scout has a very clear idea of the odds.

A Scout with 125 HP who gets lit on fire loses this control. Afterburn, in effect, is placing a time limit on the battle. Over the course of 10 seconds, anything could happen. He could, for example, walk over a roller or take a few long range scattergun chip shots and then die from the DoT because he was suddenly dropped into the HP ""danger zone"". He could W+M1 a demo and scrape by with just enough HP to live, but then die anyway. 

In addition to this, we also have to consider how the pyro tends to deal damage. Half of the pyros weapon combos involve fire as a setup for swift application of spike damage (Crit flares and axetinguishes). You're inclined to feel more vulnerable, because the pyro can deal a massive amount of damage once he lights you on fire. And then there's the visually noisy aspect of fire: it's very presence is harder to shrug off.

This results in a strong compulsion to finish the fight *now*. And this isn't just because of the potential for close range spike damage. Retreating from a flare pyro isn't *safe* in the way that retreating from a soldier or demo is. A flare doesn't suffer from damage falloff and a pyro can still reach out and kill you well outside his regular effective range. 

In my experience, this results in worse performance. Playing scout vs pyro MGE repeatedly illustrates my point. 

For those who don't play MGE mod, scouts tend to play very aggressively. 

A scout who takes, say, a 50 damage rocket or shotgun hit isn't likely to play conservatively. You certainly aren't going to see them buckling under pressure to connect good shots **right now!**

But I've noticed that scouts play differently once they're on fire. They tend to miss more. They tend to play either very aggressively or very conservatively.

One point I'd like to make here is that afterburn doesn't just affect combat classes. It messes up the heal order for medics. You're forced to prioritize scouts over heavier classes who need more heals. A medic on fire tends to play just as conservatively as a medic who has just taken 50 damage *despite the fact that his natural regen greatly reduces the damage he's taking*

----------

In addition to the direct effects of afterburn, I'm also going to cover some metagame-y uses of afterburn. This concept originates from quake.

Weakening someone is almost as good, if occasionally as good, as outright killing them.

The logic went that if someone is weak, they're going to be very predictable. You know that they'll be playing defensively, you know that they'll be trying to retreat towards health. This lets you map out their rough location and adjust your team to adapt to that.

Naturally, this isn't always the case. Some players will try for suicide attacks, while others will be unpredictable. But the idea is pretty clear - knowing that someone is almost incapable of fighting back and where they're likely going to be is an enormous advantage and it's one that can be exploited. He's not just out of the fight - he's an opening that you can exploit.

---------

Thanks for reading this disorganized late night rant of a guy who has too much time. Keep in mind that I haven't recently been involved in the comp scene proper, so I haven't had the chance to test it against a really organized and skilled team. That said, these concepts tend to hold true in my experience.

VALVe needs to support competitive more, in any way shape or form. This would be a GREAT way to get more people into comp. Make it so that way, when a player reaches 100 hours into TF2 they get introduced to the basic competitive format via a tutorial. Showing them the basic 6 classes and their roles in the game mode. They will also be able to, once they reach those 100 hours, be able to join a ""lobby"" so to speak, from the main menu. It would be like matchmaking, only for 6 people vs. 6 people, you also have to choose a class, just like in Tf2lobby. Having 9v9 ""lobbies"" would also be great. It would also be great if they could choose the difficulties Easy-Hard, and people choose themselves. Eventually, the good players WILL be playing in hard, and new players who choose hard will learn the hard way anyways. I would be satisfied with just this being integrated into TF2, however I would also love instant scrims being able to be played against other teams. One team joins in with 6 players through matchmaking, and hits ""Look for a scrim"", and they will look for other players also looking for scrims. Teams will also be able to choose their difficulty level.

So, TL;DR
Have something similar to TF2Lobby integrated into TF2
Introduce this mode along with a tutorial of basic competitive TF2 when the player hits 100 hours
Be able to schedule scrims easily by getting a team of 6 and through matchmaking look for similarly leveled teams

COPY PASTE FROM MY REDDIT POST

Give special crate drops to players who play the new lobby gamemode. They drop on a timer, say 1 for every 2 hours of this new gametypes gameplay. And only 2 drops a week. Keep stats and total kills etc. recorded.

Done, done, and done. You've increased incentive to buy keys, you bring more people into comp tf2 for the long run thereby giving the tf2 comp community the boost it needed.

All valve really has to do is offer a special one of a kind virtual item for winning, say, a tournament, and give it to the winners twice so they can trade it away for money or keys or whatever. Litteraly a nearly NO COST system for having tournaments, and introducing WAY more players to stay in playing TF2 for the long run. 

EDIT: Forgot to mention that every week it would drop ONE or TWO items in the crate that are strange, and every week it would be different, giving people incentive to buy keys and unbox EVERY WEEK.

Also, rank advancement could be based on damage done, healing done, average on a per class basis, like scout average 5-6k, soldier average 8k+, demo average 9k ish, and medic average 12k healing etc.

If you meet the average threshold for the game then you advance a rank for an ELO like system.

1335461888.0,49,self.truetf2,stutd,TF2 and Interpolation,CanadaRox,54,5,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/stutd/tf2_and_interpolation/,"First off, can we please stop linking to [this](http://www.freefrag.com/team-fortress-2/11424-cl_interp-you.html)?  It is completely inaccurate and just confuses the numerous issues people already have with understanding what interpolation is.  Interpolation has absolutely nothing to do with your ping.

What it does have to do with is the time between two consecutive packets.  The only things that affect what you want your interpolation time to be is your cl_updaterate, the server tickrate and packet loss.

Interpolation is designed to smooth out movement in case the client doesn't receive all the information it should.  If the client knows at `t1` an entity is at `(x1, y1, z1)`, misses the packet for `t2` but then gets the packet for `t3` with the client at `(x3, y3, z3)` they are able to interpolate that data to make an accurate guess as to where `(x2, y2, z2)` are.

What your lerp/`cl_interp` does is decide how long the gap is between the packets you have received and the information you see is.  A longer gap allows more packets to be missed while still being able to make a smooth guess as to what the missing packets contained.  A shorter gap doesn't allow you to miss as many packets.  A shorter gap does allows things that aren't lag compensated to appear more accurate to you.  Hit detection between clients and projectiles (and their explosions) are not lag compensated but both are interpolated for you.  A lower interpolation time will make them appear closer to where they will be for the actual knock back and damage calculations.

So now that you understand what interpolation is, and the advantages to higher and lower values, how do know what to set it to?  I have always told players to start with the lowest value they can use which for TF2 is ~15ms (due to variances in sever settings you might be able to get 14.9ms `(1 / 67)` or 15.2ms `(1 / 66)`).  To get this number, set your `cl_updaterate` and `cl_cmdrate` to 67 (the game runs at 66.6666666.... tickrate so we just round this up), your `cl_interp_ratio` to 1 and your `cl_interp` to 0.  You may be asking ""why would I set my `cl_interp` to 0?  You just told me I want 15ms lerp time"".  The answer comes from how your lerp is calculated.  The game uses the following formula to get your lerp time: `min( max( cl_interp, cl_interp_ratio / cl_updaterate ), 0.5f )`.  This means we can set your lerp time with either the `cl_interp` convar (console variable) OR the ratio `cl_interp_ratio / cl_updaterate`.  Does it matter which one you use?  Absolutely not.  Thanks to ProdigySim reverse engineering the lag compensation and interpolation code for L4D2 we know that it makes no difference at all.  I recommend doing it this way because the value of `cl_interp_ratio` can work as a guide for ""how many consecutive packets can I lose without stuff jumping around **PLUS ONE**"".  For example `cl_interp_ratio 1` would mean ""I can lose 0 consecutive packet without any issues"" and `cl_interp_ratio 10` would mean ""I can lose 9 consecutive packets without any issues"".

Okay, we have a lerp of 15ms (feel free to check by setting `net_graph 1`).  There are two possible scenarios here.

1. Everything is smooth and there is no major stuttering.  If this is where you are right now, great!  Everything is done.  You can play and you shouldn't notice any major changes to hitscan aim but will likely notice projectiles are a bit easier to land (you may need to get used to the change a bit though).

2. Everything is choppy!!  This is the bad one.  If this is where you are you will want to increase `cl_interp_ratio` until things look smooth.  Once you get there, go to step 1.

Some people will recommend using a slightly higher interp for hitscan (I've seen lots of people use ~30ms).  There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing this.  Hitscan weapons are barely affected by interpolation and will remain accurate whether your lerp time is 15ms or 500ms.  A higher value can increase the distance your melee range appears to other players as well as other players melee range to you (any competitive L4D1/2 players will know that competitive configs had to add an upper bound to lerp to prevent tanks having incredibly long arms by abusing high interpolation).  It can increase the ""I got shot around a corner!!"" feeling for both you and the person you shoot.  A jump from 15ms to 30ms isn't going to be a major change for either of these things.  The main reason people would recommend this would likely be it allows you to miss a packet without hurting your aim.  Feel free to use a slightly higher interp for your hitscan classes (scout, heavy, engineer, sniper [without the huntsman], spy).

Anyone who has read this far and understands what has been said is now an expert on interpolation and the Source engine!  You will hopefully have also known that throughout my entire explanation I didn't mention your ping anywhere.  To reiterate, this is because your lerp time/cl_interp/etc has nothing to do with your ping.

tldr: Your desired lerp is unrelated to your ping.  Use: `cl_interp 0`, `cl_updaterate 67`, `cl_cmdrate 67`, `cl_interp_ratio 1` and then slowly increase `cl_interp_ratio` until everything is smooth (as necessary).",,False,,t5_2stfn,1355964343.0,,flair-demoman,True,t3_stutd,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/stutd/tf2_and_interpolation/,

For those that don't know me, I am numlocked, demoman for Epsilon Esports, winners of ETF2L Season 14. We are a competitive 6v6 team.

You can find out more about Epsilon at both our website (http://epsilon-esports.org/) and our facebook (http://www.facebook.com/epsilonesports?fref=ts)

I decided to do a review of both my own and Epsilon’s play as a whole on the first map of the recent final. I’d really appreciate both feedback and to even just have people watch it. I’m planning to do more of the other 2 maps, I just don’t know when yet.

As we all have experienced, in all multiplayer games (TF2 included), there is a learning curve and there are experienced players. Many a newbie's experience of a game has been ruined by these experienced players yelling at them on how to play the game, ""Learn 2 Reflect"", ""You can't even aim, Scout!"", ""Spy, you suck ass, sap!"". Now, as many of us know (though not all of us here), these skills cannot be acquired instantly or even in a short amount of time. Most players don't even get into competetive or higher-level play until after 1000 hours!

We all really need to learn how to talk to new players and be helpful, rather than bashful of their inexperience. They won't aim as well as a veteran of the game, they won't be able to pull of Degreaser combos, and they might not even know the map!

It is a 3CP Gravelpit-style A/D map that aims to be the map that GPit could be with some tweaking.

The point layout is somewhat similar to GPit, taking a few ideas here and there, but generally scraps the open and wide layout of GPit for a more close-quartered and connected layout that favours defending both A and B rather than just B.

**Predictions**

xen &gt; AG 4-3 by highwayunicorn

Xensity are going to have a new-look roster for the new year, with TicTac having to go inactive due to work and that necessitating a soldier pickup. Relic is more than willing to play pocket or roamer, so it depends on who they get to fill in the other hole. Wonderwall was seen trying out recently, and I heard that Xensity asked Lange if he would play for them, so they are aiming their sights high, as expected. The loss of TicTac is going to hurt, as he has been the team's best player for three or four seasons running; anyone jumping in on short notice will probably take some time to get up to par, especially if it's someone who has been inactive for so long. Apocalypse Gaming should be able to find a good amount of kills and opportunities off of the scout play from Kapowww and squid, but something in my stomach tells me that Relic on pocket will not be much different from TicTac and mausy's play has been of solid quality so far.

So, what are some things that annoy you about the current scoring system? Anything you would balance in a different way?

Here are some ideas:

*  Would you increase/decrease the current point value of certain actions?
* Would you assign a point value to some actions that are not currently being tallied?
* Would you value the same action differently depending on some condition, like time left on the clock, cart/CP status, etc?
* Would you add more class-specific actions that are rewarded?
* Would you change the point value of certain actions depending on the class? There is already one examples of this, picking a medic as a scout.
* Would you consider having a 3rd person get assist points?

Remember this is still software, so it will be hard to detect accomplishments like ""I killed the pyro that had been airblasting our ubers so our team was able to take down the sentry nest and move forward"" or ""I was cloaked and saw a low-health burning soldier going for a health pack near me, so I grabbed it and he died"". There are a million of these subtle things that *could* have a big impact in a particular round, but they are hard to detect and most of the time they are not that worthy.

EDIT: [Here](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Score#Points) is the current list of points assigned for which actions.

I'm starting to think that most people haven't even considered the question of why certain actions were assigned a certain point value by Valve years ago and why it has barely changed (if at all). Other than a half-joke reply about points for airshots and a very solid reply about points for damage there is nothing even close to the 6 ideas I thought of in 10 minutes, which may be solid or not, I just want to get a discussion going.

People get told all the time that their place on the scoreboard or MVP list is not a true reflection of how they are doing or did on a particular round. A better scoring system would take care of some of the mismatch AND would also help the auto-balance plugins that run of lots of pub servers.

EDIT: Getting points for damage dealt has come up a few times in the thread and would be very easy to implement, I think I've seen it done in a random pub server or two.

It's an FPS where you eliminate opponents to help complete objectives so of course the scoreboard is a bit biased towards fragging classes and captures, but I think tracking some class-specific actions and valuing other actions more/less would provide a better guide to ""is this guy being as useful as engineer (or whatever else) as this other guy is being as soldier (or some other class)?""

It makes us look stupid as hell to anyone looking in. Why should anyone on the outside take us seriously when all we do is talk mad shit and pull each other down? 

There's a lot of talk about money too. Which is great. I mean, we need money to do the things we want to do, to eat, to go places, to buy other video games etc etc, but we didn't start playing because we thought we'd cash in on the TF2 money tree. The reason we boot up this game every day, play, trade, talk, write articles, stream, organise events and do all this isn't because we're looking for a get rich scheme, we do this because we're passionate about this game and about the community. When we start focusing how we can pay people to play this game we give off the impression that it sucks so much ass that we have to pay you to do this. Money is good, let's not make it the focus of why we do this.

Right now comp TF2 is so insular, all we do is share amongst ourselves, which isn't helping us any. And I know, I know that the top teams are where all the sick plays are but the only time I've ever managed to get any of my friends outside TF2 to care about what I'm doing is when I've somehow managed to link it to myself. My parents who know nothing about video games beyond Mario and Tetris watched Sal cast my scrubby game because I was in it. Same with my friends, because it was me they watched and some of them booted up the game for the first time in forever. 

The showmatches and the top level play might interest older members of the community because they know the players and the history of the teams, but to outsiders they have no idea what's happening. So I'm appealing to all the casters to cast more lower level games. I think we massively need to invest in the lower skilled/newer in the community, that's the lifeblood. Yeah okay we want to get more people in, more teams involved, but what do we do to keep them interested? Yes, TF2 needs celebrities and stars, but we can't just have the same 100 top players watching these people stream, and how would the newer players know who the fuck to root for or watch if we don't engage them?

So yes, that is what I think.

Yet sometimes I'll find myself fighting a scout that likes to back away and kite me with his pistol at a range where he can easily dodge pipes. So I pull out my stickylauncher and kill him. Or perhaps I'll be dueling some soldier who will jump on spire and stay there, so naturally I pull out my stickylauncher and kill him too. What should a soldier expect to happen if he tries to cap spire while a demo is holding in trash? Why would a scout try to fight a demo at midrange?

Needless to say, people get inordinately angry about this. I understand that MGE is about honing one's deathmatching skills, not about winning. And I realize I'm not learning much by spamming stickies at a soldier staying on spire, but why is it considered poor form to do so?

Another challenge for you guys to have fun with. This time, we will be using a very special weapon. ""Why is this weapon special?"" you may ask. Well, it's special because it's the first weapon unlock that EVER graced the wild lands of TF2, all the way back in the 24th February 2008. **The Gold Rush Update**!  
Now, this update did actually come with three weapons. All for the Medic. Two of them became the most widely used unlocks in the competitive scene of TF2, a second standard loadout for the Medic, while the last one was left in the dust.  
  
Now, I think it's time I stop dancing around the question and show you the weapon:  
  
Ladies, I present:  
##THE BLUTSAUGER!  
  
Yes people! It's the gun that started the whole Battle Medic! Lets get down to business and see what the gun actually does:  
* On Hit: + 3 health  
* -2 health drained per second on wearer  
Don't be afraid of the negative. You still have +1 regenerative health left while wearing this weapon, so you won't be loosing health.  
  
This is indeed the first unlock that graced the old veteran players hands. But sadly, after a couple of nerfs, this gun quickly fell out of favor for the stock Syringe Gun and in this day and age, people would much rather use the Crusaders Crossbow. People simply don't like the less health regen.  
Anyways. Today is the day we dust of the old blood sucker and turn the nearest Scout/Spy/Heavy into porcupines while you skip away with not a scratch taken!

**Rules** Nearly unchanged from last time, but anyway  
* You have to play Medic for at least 1 hour    
* Can't change class in the middle of the challenge  
* You have to use this weapon  
* You need to play real Medic!(no SpyMedic with Ubersaw, no MedicUberMedic combo ect ect)

IAmA regular Xbox player, AMA.",,82,34,153,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/z81n0/lets_settle_any_misconceptions_about_tf2_on/,"I frequently play TF2 on console, and I have noticed since  subscribing that there are a large amount of misconceptions when it comes to playing on console. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. My schedule is a little hectic, but I will do my best to answer any and all questions. Questions do not have to be limited to misconceptions, any curiosity you have about console is appreciated.Edit:Some basic points so you dont have to go through the comments.

1. Pyro is stubbed, and has the least potential out of any class without the airblast. In the comments you will see me making arguments defending the Pyro, but as I have learned from talking with you guys, he is the least favorable class to play and only has uses in niche scenarios.

2.The community is live and well, there is almost always games to join.(dependent on location)

3.Highly skilled players can be found, and matches are generally well balanced. There are lobbies where somebody is abusing class limitations, which can be a problem if it is the only match at that time.

4.While the controller can be limiting, Soldiers can still rocket jump and perform advanced rocket jumping maneuvers, though without scripts or a mouse, this becomes much more difficult, though is still attainable. Don't expect to obtain a rocket jumping level anywhere near PC, but the basics can be done.

5.The game is very well balanced as a whole, there are no real viable exploits or cheap strategies. Skyboxing can still be done on a couple levels, though players can simply slip past the sentry and go for the objective. It is easiest to do on Dustbowl, but it rarely ever happens. A spy can just cloack past the skybox sentrt and cap the point.

6.There are only 6 maps:2Fort, Dustbowl, Well, Granary, Gravel Pit, and Hydro.

7.No hats.

8.The Demoman has a normal grenade launcher that performs exactly the same as PC stock. 4 grenades. All classes have stock weapons.

9.Medics regen rate is 1HP/second if he took damage recently, the longer he stays out of combat the more it raises until 3HP/second.",,False,,t5_2stfn,1346603989.0,,,True,t3_z81n0,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/z81n0/lets_settle_any_misconceptions_about_tf2_on/,

The following is my opinion, open to be commented on, criticized, etc. 
---------------------------------------------------------------

**Original thread title:** Reddit, know any good pub servers?

**My Response:**

I have been on the same search for a while now, and I have come across a bunch of great servers as a result. A short preface: It all depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for a more 'competitive' pub experience, don't play anything above 24 players, reasons for this should be obvious.

Also, big Servers like Skial, Lotus, etc are full of donators who get ridiculous benefits and I also find that a lot of skill-less and clueless new players (NOT ALL NEW PLAYERS, SOME ARE WICKED BEANS!) frequent these servers because they are big and popular and usually have bots on off-peak hours.

The Unofficial Reddit, Pony Fortress, Trashed Gamers, Furry (Fury?) Pound and [NO HEROES] servers are MUCH better than the aforementioned ones above, but I still find a lot of anti-teamwork sentiment and little concern for team balancing (because every team needs that 4th sniper or spy am i right?) on these servers. Sometimes they have competent players but not often enough for me (I play A LOT), but ARE worth looking at on your journey.

SO! Amongst the 'best' east coast pubs, I have found are the following (I am almost hesitant to promote them b/c they all have an excellent player base and I don't wanna bring the kind of crap players I have been trying to get away from): Critsandvich.com, Star's East Coast, [!?]Teaminterrobang and Pokemon Town fun-center servers.

At the end of the day, you are pubbin', people be crazy.

**EDIT2** - OK, had a busy day at work today, and answering the comments took up most of my free time.  Ill post it up whenever I can (yeah real life is rough) and probably will post a new thread so its not buried. Thanks for all the supportive criticisms, it only makes the guide better!

So after playing a bit of MvM, and reading the countless posts of MvM class related strategy here, I've taken it upon myself to compile an MvM Medic Guide. I've played Boot Camp with Valve-server-quality players, and have also played on private servers. *Yes, I've done this on advanced2*

Please enjoy the read, and I will enjoy the (de)constructive criticism that is bound to follow.

**Intro** 

The Universal Golden Rule of any shooting game is ***Dont Die.*** Ran like a pansy? Doesnt matter, LIVED, and now you're going back with a vengeance to teach that robot a lesson.

As a Medic, you are responsible not only for your own life, but for the lives of your team.  This means knowing when to NOT plunge into the valley of the shadow of death with your teammates, and acting as a field commander of sorts, telling your patient to GTFO when you do.

**As a Medic in MvM you have three choices.**  

* Firmly abide by that Golden rule.  *You run the Stock Medigun.*  You should have zero deaths by mission end (Quite possible), and your teammates should have less than five deaths total. *Part 1 of Guide*

* Slightly Bend that rule. *You run Kritz.*  You should have as few deaths as possible, but focus mostly on deploying Kritz as much as possible. Your teammates are expendable, and should know when they need to disregard survival and lay down the DPS. *[Part 2 of Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/zb8d2/mvm_medic_guide_pt2_kritz/)*

* Ignore the rule. *You run Quick Fix.* No guide. Choose another Medigun.

This program generates configuration files for Team Fortress 2

Features:
--------

* Ability to specify for each class/weapon-slot to specify the:
  - Crosshair (color, type, scale)
  - Sensitivity
  - Showing/Hiding the weapon model
  - Dingaling (volume, max/min pitch)
  - Interp-ratio
  - Tweakable viewmodel hiding behaviour. After switching weapons, hide the viewmodel after strafing/shooting or immediately
* Null-movement canceling: if you press two opposite strafe keys, you will no longer stand still
* Can include chris' network/graphics config
* Option to hide the tracers, flames or the medic healbeam
* Option to show a netgraph with the scoreboard to identify network issues
* Option to turn gibs/ragdolls/sprays on/off
* Most of the useful advanced options you can already find in the tf2 menu (autoreload, fastswitch, damagenumbers, etc)
* Crouchjump bind, with the option to exclude it for certain classes (default excluded for demoman/soldier)
* Team-only voice bind
* Bind for quick-switching weapon loadouts
* Bind for toggling to a forward spawn (if you want to retain uber or types of charge, switch weapons with the quickswitch bind instead)
* Binds for switching primary/secondary, switching current/melee, previous weapon, next inventory and previous inventory weapon
* Bind for suicide, reloading the hud and fixing graphical glitches
* Binds for all the voice commands
* Medic: Medic radar bind, fake uber bind, option to communicate ubers automatically through chat
* Spy: A disguise cycle bind (separate friendly and enemy disguise cycle) which cycles through a list of predefined disguises. Quickdisguise binds (enemy and friendly). Temporarily shows viewmodel when using cloak/dr
* Engineer: Quickbuild binds
* Sniper: option to disable the crosshair when zooming in, option to change the zoomed in sensitivity, option to sound a bell when the sniper rifle is charged
* Zoom in bind (changes fov+sensitivity to zoom in)
* P-Rec settings

Installation:
-------------

* Download the program [here](https://github.com/downloads/logophobia/YetAnotherTF2ConfigGenerator/YATF2ConfigGenerator-0.10.zip)
* Make sure you have a new version of the java runtime (1.6 or higher would probably work) installed, [this is a version without toolbar crap](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1637588.html)
* Unzip the program and double click on the jar file to start
* Set everything up the way you want to, make sure you copy most of your essential settings in tf2, like your mouse sensitivity (very annoying when that gets changed)
* Select your steam directory and username and save the configuration files to tf2
* Save the settings for further editing if you might want to change some small things later
* Use the backup button to make a backup if you have any scripts you might like to preserve

Uninstallation:
---------------

* Delete all the .cfg files inside the tf/cfg directory
* Run tf2 once with the -autoconfig flag (inside the launch options) to reset tf2 to default
* Place any backed-up cfg files back

FAQ:
----

### I am having issues, it crashes. How can I fix this?

&gt; Try the following things:
&gt;
&gt; * Make sure you unzip your program before running it, otherwise it won't be able to find any of the files it needs
&gt; * Upgrade java to its latest version (from the link provided in the installation instructions), earlier java version don't work very well with this program
&gt; * Try to generate the scripts locally, and copying them manually the the tf/cfg directory in the team fortress installation directory1
&gt; * Post an explanation + screenshot (if applicable) with the crash/issue on my github page: github.com/logophobia/YetAnotherTF2ConfigGenerator or add me at steamcommunity.com/id/logophobia

### What is viewmodel switch mode?

&gt; It indicates when the viewmodel is turned off if that is set for the weapon slot:
&gt;
&gt; * Immediately after switching weapons
&gt; * After firing a weapon
&gt; * After switching strafe directions
&gt; * After either firing or strafing

### I have a feature request, where can I post it?

&gt; Post any suggestions on the github page

### What does medic radar do precisely?

&gt; It toggles medic autocall to 150%, so each of your teammates has a medic symbol above their heads, which you can see through walls. As soon as you let go of the button, it will go back to its original autocall level

### How can I customize this even more?

&gt; You could try editing the original templates, in the template directory. First, delete the cache directory. Then edit the templates, the language used is ssp: http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html. After that, the program will use your editted version of the templates. 

### What other ways to customize tf2 are there?

&gt; You can install custom huds, skins, hitsounds or customize/make your own scripts

### My ambassador crosshair disappeared, how can I fix this?

&gt; For some reason, the crosshair after shooting is about half the default size. Increasing the size of the spy primary crosshair should fix this.

### Changing settings inside tf2 doesn't work, it just gets changed back. How can I change my settings?

&gt; The scripts that were installed now regulate most of your settings inside tf2. Change stuff through the program, and then reinstall the scripts, or uninstall the scripts and be free to change things inside tf2 again.

Todo:
-----

* Check bind conflicts
* Live update class specific stuff in the weapons tab
* Make the GUI a bit prettier (javafx instead of swing maybe)
* Rewrite code to be a bit (a lot) prettier
* Other requests?

Known Bugs:
-----------

* When building as an engineer, if you start building, then switch weapons before putting the building down, the crosshairs will get out of sync, switch weapons once to fix

**KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES**

1. The blue sniper deck with the small health pack has a weird black texture

2. Some places are still dark. The tunnels on the right side of spawn. The large health pack room. Under sniper deck. Torches could be added to brighten things up.

4. The black lake texture looks really ugly. It should be replaced by a blue lake texture.

6. The pit is glitched so that your death cam/screen and spectating of your team takes a long time to appear. Your body also falls weirdly and lags through the bottom of the death pit.

[**The Round Robin**](http://theroundrob.in/) is a **one day Highlander tournament** run by the Jolly *'default win to the top'* Ranchers an EU team that's been around for about a year. It's been pretty successful tournament so far. We have a North American division and a European division, where teams duke it out first in a round robin style in groups, and then into an elimination round where we crown our champions. EU and NA winners can then duke it out at a later date for the all-round champion, as we all know there can only be one. 

Each team that plays should have three games, with the first and second place teams playing five games on the day. It is a long Sunday afternoon, but be honest, what were you going to anyway besides play TF2. Don't say study, that's a lie. Liar! And if you say other games then you're a liar too because there are no other games. The tournament (the Team Tournament) is on the 9th of December. 

Team signups are accessible through [**here**](http://theroundrob.in/rrr6teamsignup). 

If you're not in a team or you're in a 'transition period' and you're in Europe we run a separate tournament (The Mentoring Tournament) where we place you in a team and assign you a mentor team. At the moment our sexy mentors are, Kritzkast Distinguished Ducks, Sexy Internet Redheads, It's All About the Gibus, Team Awesome and some members of Colony. Bear in mind this separate tournament is more for the newer players, so if you have any friends who are looking to try Highlander as a format send them this way. 

This tournament is on the 2nd of December and you can register for it [**here**](http://theroundrob.in/rrr6mentorsignup).

As a side note, there are two subreddits r/girlgamers &amp; r/teamfortresstwox who are trying to get a bunch of girls who are interested in playing HL competitively ... er playing. If you know of any girls who are too shy to sign up,  there are two (mostly) all female teams one NA and one EU that are looking for players. Sign ups for that are open [**here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/teamfortresstwoX/comments/11mfiz/sign_up_here_for_the_rtf2x_rgirlgamers_all_star/).

Personally, I think it helps it. If a team of invite players get together and learns the highlander game, their DM ability from 6s will be extremely hard for the top highlander teams to beat. I think this will fast forward the meta-game of HL and force others to start thinking and taking highlander more seriously.

I've been screwing around with commands and, thanks to [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dw7_xBxfxA), discovered cl_leveloverview.  It looks good in this video and you can see how teams push using this tool, but for a while it was very glitchy, replacing large parts of maps with a green overlay.  Took a bit of digging to fix it, but it can be done with one command.

So here's how to get a clean orthographic view of a map like the one above.

1. Open a new private server or STV demo.
2. Enable cheats (sv_cheats 1)
3. Turn off your HUD (cl_drawhud 0)
4. Enter the level overview command (cl_leveloverview x, wherein x is a zoom value)
5. Enter the command r_novis 1.  This fixes the green patches.

I plan on using this tool later on in my Moose Tracks videos.  Enjoy using them to analyze your own matches!

I play mostly sniper ^(and soldier, but that's irrelevant), and I had a few questions about melee weapons. I read the sidebar and FAQ, and I searched the subreddit but didn't find any recent sniper melee discussion. I came up with this comparison earlier today (originally posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1f46yy/my_dad_and_i_made_a_tribalmans_shiv_for_my/ca6u751)):

***Stock Kukri/Frying Pan/Ham Shank/Saxxy/Conscientous Objector/Freedom Staff/Memory Maker/Bat Outta Hell:***

* a solid **65** dmg per hit
* **195** dmg from a random crit


***Bushwacka:***

* **65** dmg per hit
* can random crit for **195** dmg
* **20%** fire damage vulnerability isn't good, but if a pyro's in your face you're probably dead anyway; if you've been hit by a flare from afar, you can just douse yourself with Jarate
* guarantees crits instead of minicrits (great with Jarate or with Fan-of-War or against GRU)
* if you're using the Bushwacka, you kind of have to use Jarate, those guaranteed crits are great for one-shotting light classes


***Tribalman's Shiv:***

* **32.5** dmg per hit
* **97.5** dmg from a random crit
* **8** bleed dmg per second (**4** per tick) for **6** seconds = **48** total bleed dmg
* **80.5** total dmg per hit (or **145.5** from a random crit)
* damage is not really its focus, you still need to swing twice to kill even a light class
* the Shiv is only really useful for using the bleed effect to track cloaked spies, a purpose which Jarate serves better (since it lasts **10** seconds instead of the Shiv's **6**)


***Shahanshah:***

* HP ≥ 50%: **49** dmg per hit, **146** from a random crit
* HP &lt; 50%: **81** dmg per hit, **244** from a random crit
* if you're at high hp, you'll need at least 3 hits to kill any enemy, you'll die too quickly to do anything
* if you're at low hp, you'll still need at least 2 hits to kill any enemy, and you'll probably be meatshotted instantly anyway
* the stock kukri can deal almost as much damage in those same 2 hits and doesn't require you to be at low health
* basically, *this weapon requires far too many swings to be of any use*, and sniper doesn't have enough hp to be jumping around, swinging constantly

The Bushwacka seems fine, even a little too strong sometimes, but the other two seem absolutely useless. I've never really seen them used effectively. So:

* Does the Bushwacka need a nerf?
* Does the Tribalman's Shiv need a buff?
* Does the Shahanshah need a buff?

Personally, my answers are no, yes, yes.

I think the only reason that everyone uses the Bushwacka is not because it's overpowered, but because the other two are underpowered.

If you answered no to either of the last two questions, convince me why I should use either of them over the Bushwacka or stock.

a lot of calls you can make as main caller is from the feedback you get from your players, too much ive been hammering on how its important it is that everyone calls out their respective essential calls
-damage numbers
-focus fire
-when they are making a flank
-when they are down
- who is picking up the medic at spawn

Too many times I witnessed that a roamer goes in for a bomb without saying, or if you are roamer and your pocket soldier is dead, and he didnt say so, so i didn’t notice and we have slower charge or even worse our medic unprotected.

The most important thing though, i think is be calm and concize in your calls, and be able to admit you made mistakes, listen to the feedback of your teammates and figure out why. if poeple are shouting or swearing, it’s actually good, poeple need to vent a bit of frustration, Id rather have that, then someone who just goes silent and gives up. But its your task as captain to cheer poeple up, cuase in the end, you are playing a videogame to have fun right. It’s all about poeple management and placing empathy, but I digress.

also if something happens and you need to improvise a strat in your head quickly, just keep in mind that if you communicate very clear and put emphasis on the objectives your team needs to accomplish

what i mean is like, imagine you got mid on gully, and it’s stalematey, and you think there is an opening through flank, you can communicate your core needs to push there AND keep like for example a roamer and scout in choke, so they just can’t cap mid while you are fighting on second with two scouts. I learned this myself cuz i used to say: PUSH FLANK NOW HURRY, and then like two scouts ran through choke and started capping. Then again, what you can also do, is have certain strats prepared already in advance, and then you can use simple terms like “aggro rollout” or something, and everyone should be on the same page, it clears up a lot of the coms. cause it is great if everyone coms but, 4 poeple talking through each other is a mess. But w/e i guess thats how i see it as a div6 shitter


====================


Main calling takes a lot of time to become even vaguely proficient at imo, the only way to do it is jump in, make mistakes, realise that every call you make WONT be perfect, even more so starting out, and work with your team.

As medic I call my percentage often so the flanks will have a decent idea when we’re pushing anyway, then a little countdown as we approach the doorway or choke, “pushing in 3….2…..1…..we’re in”, I’ve found it much easier to spend a bit of time with your team going over pushes, walking around the map, so in-game comms and calls can be short and sharp, “go aggro right” for instance is a much easier call than “Boomeh up on crates, Kaidus go balcony, Bybben and Wltrs charge med pack….” or w/e.

You cant micro manage, give them the ‘when’, let them sort out the ‘how’.

I started main calling about a year and a bit ago and I’m still terrible. I was much worse. Just go for it, ask your teamates to follow you whatever you call, work it out from there. Analyse mistakes after the round or match. Count uber. Count player numbers. If you have a 2 man advantage, demo or medic up to theirs down, or full uber to them with none…FUCKING PUSH!!!!

Good luck.


===================


It seems like the main idea is the degree of autority you want to employ. I prefer a more “flat” command structure where whoever can make a call as soon as they’re certain enough of it’s viability. Since a well functioning team is expected to rarely make any bad decision a silent consensus is preferable to minimize chatter, and otherwise a plain no will do. Make sure that you don’t push your teammates to actions on the brink of stupidity just for the sake of obedience. Sometimes, the most aggression you can manage from your side under a agressive push call is hanging back and staying alive, and that’s perfectly fine. When everyone is equally well informed the main caller handles things, the other players should override, when an opertunity arised or the situation is getting out of hand. The individual player is like a feedback system. You try something, evaluate if the action put you in a more advanageous position, check how your teammates responded to your move, evaluate the possibilities, rinse and repeat. Opertunities can fade quickly in this loop and a clear direction from whoever rather than channeling the decision through the main caller can buy you the time to cease it as team. Encourage the creativeness of your teamamtes. Take extra care to call disctinct transitions in offense and defence when e.g. scouts don’t have visual feedback of what you’re doing. To many times have I rushed in to late/early because of bad main callers or been left to die as they suddenly pulled out without notice. This is by far the greatest calling related nuisance from my perspective as a scout. Having one or two people going in from another angle in pushes can be really effective, but it relies heavily on that the rest of the team let these people know what they are up to to that they can time their approach properly (skeej is pretty thorough about this. hi skeej :D). I have never been able to trust any of my own teams on this, and usually have to resort to visual feedback. A feather in your hat if you can pull that off. Also make sure to check with people maining as different classes to see what part is particularily important for them to be able to fulfil their roles, common pitfalls if you like.

oh, here we go again, wall of text…bet I killed this tread just like all the others :/



**Momentum in TF2 - A Push Guide**

Wednesday, 14 April 2010 19:27 Sigma

One of the main problems experienced by ""low"" - ""mid"" teams is a failure to understand when an opportunity presents itself. Often when spectating or ringing, I see a team crawl through yard 6v3 and give up a 15s charge advantage, or push mid 6v6 even uber, or leave a demo and soldier on last against 2 freshly-spawned scouts. The words ""should we push?"" echo through the mumble as the 5s window to take a position closes and the round slips away. So, with the CEVO season underway and ESEA just around the corner, I figured I would write a bit about how to recognize and take advantage of opportunities. If you feel that you have to leave someone on the last point before you can move up, or if you don't know why you can roll a round in 2 minutes then spend 20 failing pushes to last, read on.

 
The Caller

The easiest way to keep your team coordinated is to, for the most part, follow the plan of one player without question. Your comms should revolve around feeding information to the caller and reacting to what the caller says. Of course, anyone can make a call when they see a good opportunity, but the caller has the power to cancel anything and have their plan followed. In my opinion it's best to have the medic call, as he can easily track uber and the health of your team, but in practice anyone can do it.

Unfortunately, with your entire team following 1 person's calls you will inevitably get a bad call at some point and wipe. This is not a reason to question calls. This is a necessary sacrifice to have your team stay coordinated. It's much better to all follow a bad call than half follow a good call. As your caller gets more experienced this will happen less and less.

So, how does the caller know what calls to make? This is where we really get into it. For the most part I will avoid ""how to push"" and stick to ""why/when to push"".

 
The Basics - Picks, Uber, and Spawn Advantage

Whenever I play, I keep a number in my mind to determine if we should be pushing or they should be pushing. I calculate this number by counting the number of players alive (treating the demo and med as 2 each), adding 1 for uber advantage, 1 for spawn advantage, and 1 for a sticky trap. Other factors aside, being even indicates that neither team should push, +1 indicates that you can push but success is 50-50 (push but don't overextend), and +2 or more indicates that you can roll through.

For example, the map is badlands. Both teams have uber, 6 up, and your team is holding mid. You have the spawn advantage (+1), but if you don't know where the trap is (-1), you can't really push. So, say you have your roamer sit in house while one of their scouts decides to be dumb and run in there. You've now got a pick (+1) -- if you can figure out where the trap is or make the demo pop his stickies, you'll have +2 total and a solid push on spire.

Let's flip the situation around. Still badlands, you're defending yard. Your scouts push up, get lucky, and kill a scout. You have a pick (+1), but they have spawn advantage (-1) and if you don't know where the trap is (-1), you definitely can't push (-1 total). The fact that this represents is that it's pointless to be make aggressive, risky plays when you won't be able to capitalize.

Another example: you're defending badlands last 6v6 with even ubers. Their demo runs in like a fool and dies. That's +2 for the demo pick, -1 for spawn advantage. You know there's no trap so it's +1 total -- you can make a push on spire if you want. Of course, if you attempt that push on spire while leaving your demo to watch last, you're really pushing at -1, so you'll fail miserably. Point: pushing 6v5 out of last is viable as long as you man up and cover exits.

Now for a few considerations. While checking the scoreboard to see who's up is a good idea, remember to consider the position of those players as well. If they just got spawns, particularly soldiers/the demoman, you have a window of time where those players are still useless (and in the case of the demoman, a longer window where there will be no trap). Additionally, having an advantage does not mean you can always use the same push. Imagine you have 6 up, spawn advantage, no uber, they have only a soldier and medic with uber. You have +5 on this push, but if you just blindly charge forward you'll get popped on and lose. Being in a situation like that still indicates that you should attack, but the focus of your attack should be on forcing the enemy charge and not dying rather than just taking territory. It is for reasons like this that tracking the enemy charge is important beyond just calculating whether or not to attack. A 3s charge advantage can be used to pick the enemy medic at 95% if you know you have it and they're not careful.

This way of calculating advantage applies to most maps and most points, but not all. Freight last is an extreme counterexample; I would put -1 to any push on to freight last and -2 (-3 considering spawn) to any push off of it (I also consider a trap to be -2 on this push -- it's almost impossible to cap 2 back against a demoman). Pushing from gran mid to gran yard is also an interesting case. You can't really push it if it's 6 up on both sides with no ubers to speak of, and you have to be very careful with how you uber in. You have to be aggressive enough to not let the enemy hold charge, but careful enough to get your medic back out. This is why you often see teams spend a long time poking around for an opening before pushing to gran yard. But wait, people rarely ever gets picks from spamming those doors. So why do they do it?


Momentum - Position, Health, and Ammo

I'm sure everyone has experienced those awesome rounds where you chain pushes together all the way from 2 to 5, crushing their team in every fight without giving up a frag. Why does this happen? It is often a matter of constantly fighting 6v3 as their spawns overextend and die, but the same thing happens in 6v6 situations. Fast pushes against a retreating enemy constantly hammer on their health and ammo, never giving them a chance to recover. A soldier who retreats with 50hp takes 10s to re-buff if you keep chipping shots at him to block crit heals. 10s! That's 25% of an uber, where the medic is healing nobody but that one lit soldier.

The position, health, and ammo of the enemy is much more fleeting than the big constants behind a push, but these are much stronger motivations for fast attacks and retreats. If you're 3v6 but all of them have 10hp, go in and you will win. If you're 2 down and falling back, but their demo overextends into your combo with his combo 3s behind him, you stop and frag that demo. If you're 1 down and don't really want to push, but the enemy demo pops a trap he just set, it's a great time to rush in (he can't fire stickies). Mistakes in position and low health/ammo are reasons to discard everything I wrote in the previous section and go for damage/kills.

Since temporary health or positional advantages are harder to read and much more situational than things like picks, I can't offer a formula that tells you when to take advantage of them. Essentially, you should exploit the enemy's position as much as possible to put on as much damage as you can while not taking too much damage, and you should exploit the enemy's health as much as possible to get as many frags as you can while giving up too many frags. If you're fighting with 1 soldier against the entire set of enemy heavies, it's worth staying in long enough to put a few spam rockets on (damage them while not being damaged) then retreat. If there are scouts around to threaten a frag on that soldier or you're in a position where their superior numbers will let them hurt you more than your spam can hurt them, it's time to get out. The more experience you have paying attention to these situations, the more you'll be able to recognize and take advantage of them.

Now, to answer the question posed in the previous section. Why do people sit at chokes (like granary mid-&gt;yard) and spam? The reason is to pressure and watch for any mistakes from the opponent. If the attacking side gets the worse side of the spam (which they usually do), they can pull back and heal up, sitting comfortably on top of their spawn advantage. If, however, they gain an advantage of any form -- health, ammo, position, a pick, etc. -- they can immediately capitalize on it. This is the concept of taking actions before committing to a push to make that push easier (why push at +1 when you could push at +2?). This idea is where suicide plays, overloading one side of the map, and basically anything that avoids fighting combo vs combo comes from.

I feel that a lot of teams don't really understand this. It's as if players watched an invite match where there was a mid-yard stalemate on granary, and figured, ""Oh, when EG caps mid, they sit on it and spam the yard for 4 minutes before pushing. Next time we cap mid, we should sit on it and spam for 4 minutes."" All too often I watch a team let their advantage slip away, because they get caught in the routine of cap -&gt; move to choke -&gt; spam -&gt; move up without paying attention to the status of the other team. Or, they'll get a soldier knocked down to 100hp and wait to heal up, even if the enemy had 2 soldiers at 50. Gauging the damage the other team takes in comparison to yours and acting appropriately is extremely important.


I hope you've learned something by reading this, or at least found it interesting. Feel free to drop a comment asking a question, or saying how wrong I am, or complaining about my writing.

Cheers,
Sigma


**Plus a little something from Taimou**

In my eyes a medic should maincall if they know the team and players well enough, since he/she should automatically know where his/her teammates are without even asking, just calling own position.
A lot comes down to the medics own experience and gamesense too, you must atleast know where the enemies are even without teammates calling their position. If you can’t do this, you can maincall but you must have a soldier/demo help maincalling pushes since you just can’t see through corners.

I myself use sound and knowledge of past games against certain players and teams to locate my enemies so I can call everyone to push without anyone notifying where the hell are the enemy. :p

Then there’s few things/tricks that make you a better medic(Though some of these won’t help/shouldn’t be practiced, before you can actually play medic to a decent level):

Sounds, if you have played games alot, footsteps should be heard in tf2 even though it is much harder with people calling and rockets+stickies raining down. I can hear a scout or two flanking from house when my team pushes choke in badlands, it’s just so easy, valley is another thing then.

Little jumps that can help you survive/make you go faster to mid/surprise the enemy: In granary/gravelpit/badlands.

Hey there /r/truetf2,

I don't know why I didn't think about this earlier - With such a big community here, we ought to submit an application to get ourselves represented in CvP4.  Myself and bamfusername will be considering applications and nominations and putting the most qualified players to vote for positions in the CvP4 application.  You don't have to be a pro to apply, you just have to know your class well and be willing to work with some of the biggest names in TF2!  The application will work in this way -

**PLEASE READ THOROUGHLY!** 

In order to apply for a position, you must message **[this account](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=TrueTF2Reply)** with this information:

1. Title the submission with the player name or Reddit username.
2. Clarify whether the submission is for an application or a nomination.
3. Re-state the player's name or Reddit username.
4. Add a Steam Profile link if you're applying for yourself or the player's personal Reddit user page if you're nominating them.
5. If you're applying for yourself, add your favorite class.  If you're nominating for someone else I will message them for their preferred class.
6. Describe why you are nominating a player or applying for yourself.  Don't be shy - talk about your competitive experience, how many hours you have in your favorite class, what you do for the community, or how much you help out around the subreddit.  The more qualified you are, the more likely it is that you'll be pushed through to voting.

___

Therefore, a full application would look something like:

    Title: Davidmoose
    1. Application
    2. Davidmoose
    3. Reddit Profile / Steam Profile
    4. Soldier
    5. I have 2 seasons' experience playing Soldier in a Highlander 
    environment.  I also have experience against 6's teams, a total
    of 950 hours in Soldier alone.  In addition, I spend many hours 
    a week helping Highlander teams through a mentoring program and
    through my ""Moose Tracks"" video series.  I am active in the
    subreddit and would appreciate the consideration for the CvP4 
    vote.

Again, do not message me with your application, write a message to **[this account](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=TrueTF2Reply)**.

*Be sure that if you nominate someone else to tell us why you nominated them!  We'd love to see what you think about the others in the community.*
____

This stage of application will last one week, or until 11:59 PM EST on Saturday, April 28.  At that time applications will close and we will tally up the most qualified submissions for a vote the next week.

The one unfortunate caveat I have is that the CvP tournament is North American, so it's doubtful that Europeans will be able to play successfully in the event (although I hear there are some considerations for a World Cup over in ETF2L that might be worth checking into for our neighbors across the pond).  CvP will also not allow players who have played in a competitive 6's league, even for one game [PROOF](http://www.extelevision.com/cvp/).  Sorry guys :/

This event could be a great thing for our community, so be sure that you apply if you feel qualified to do so.  I honestly want to see lots of applications and nominations, so feel free to apply!

I know this will devolve into ""crits vs. nocrits"", but try to minimize that.

SO

Why are crits in the game at all? I see it as being 3 reasons.

1. Aggressive players rack up lots of damage to increase their crit chance.

2. As a sort of balance for weapons that don't crit, always crit, and cause mini crits.

3. So that new players manage to kill a god-tier soldier every once in a while, lest they give up and play the hatless call of duty instead.

Enforcing nocrits really does make the game feel better, but at the same time removes something that DOES add balance. Nocrits means weapons like the enforcer come dangerously close to straight upgrade - and nobody wants that.

But what if crits were just minicrits? A random crocket wouldn't be certain death, but would still do its job in terms of balance.

Hey truetf2ers, title couldn't be possible longer, but gets the majority of the point across.  Say you are watching a livestream by eXtv, thinmop, or whomever else may be casting.

Before the match starts, you pay metal in to the caster, and wager it down on a team to win.  Simple philosophy from here, and you get to (hopefully) see your payout at the end. 

eXtv can turn a small profit from this by having the payouts be slightly house favored, so they make some profit out of it as well in metal, which can in turn be sold in the whole i46 preparation dealio.  

Simple list:

* Pay metal to start
* Watch game for outcome
* (Potentially) Win metal
* % of all metal goes towards i46 donation drive

* Would you participate in the gambling of said activities?

I just wanted to congratulate and thank all the amazing mentors and players that put this together. Here's how it went down:

I came in late, they put me into overflow but fortunately enough extra people joined for them to add me into a fourth mix. Yes, there were 4 mixes going simultaneously, with multiple mentors on each team. That's 4 separate servers, 48 players and at least 8 mentors all being managed and sorted out by a few people.

I was lucky enough to land a spot as Medic, my favorite class, but I've never played in comp style before; I've only watched shout casts. I can't believe how different it is from pubs... I was so used to pubs I even taunted once after a round win out of habit oblivious to the fact the next round would be starting right away! Everyone on my team was forgiving and helpful even with my big mistakes and unsuccessful uber flashes. We ended up winning the game and our mentor gave everyone very well thought out critiques to every team member afterwards. I then got some great advice from other experienced Medics in the Medic Mumble chat room.

If you haven't tried competitive 6v6 yet and you have a basic understanding of how it all works, there's no reason why you shouldn't try it out. They're doing another one tomorrow and based on the success of tonight, expect a huge turnout!

For those who haven't been keeping track, here is a short outline of what has transpired.

A drama post concerning the conduct of the developers of TF2Center, a work-in-progress alternative to TF2Lobby was recently posted. It was subsequently removed for two reasons. 

Firstly, the conduct of the poster was terrible. I believe that this is a subreddit meant for meaningful, rational discussion, and the content of that post is the antithesis of what I try to foster as a moderator. Second, it was a drama post.  Drama appears to be inevitable online, but there are good ways and bad ways to deal with it. That was the bad way. [A more comprehensive discussion of the first post can the found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1edw1d/on_the_tf2center_post/)

This leads me to the reason for the removal of the second post.

Firstly, the real name of the initial thread starter was used, and it is evident that consent was not sought. It may not seem like a significant issue, but it is important that the privacy concerns of all users be respected. I was messaged earlier by WafflesSandwhiches about this, and feel that this alone is grounds for removal.

Secondly, although I did request an official statement to close the matter, I don't believe that this was conducted very well either. While I understand the desire to rebut and refuse any allegations made in the original thread, the manner in which this was done was, in my opinion, inappropriate. We did not need additional personal details regarding the matter. There is rarely a need to disclose the reasons for the release of an employee. Nor did we need to know the financial involvement said employee had in the project. 

Unlike the previous modpost, I will not be posting the details of the removed thread. Accountability be damned - I intend for private matters to stay private. The contents of this post should have been kept private, and it is regrettable that many users appear to already have seen it. I don't think I need to remind the community not to grab your pitchforks and get invested in this conflict and repeat any of the information disclosed today.

I'd like to end with two comments.

Firstly, this does not forbid further discussion of TF2Center.

And secondly, to close the matter, I'd like to leave this quote from Lydiaxa, which, in my opinion, resolves the matter, even if it is not from the mouth of the developers. Hopefully, they'll take this suggested approach:

&gt; It's very fair that they should respond to the post, but I disagree that this was professional. Line-by-line responses and grammar problems are certainly not the apex of public relations. The kind of ""statement"" I'd expect would be along the lines of:

&gt; TF2Center removed a member from its development team this week. We are resolving this conflict internally and do not feel that it would be appropriate to discuss this private situation in a public setting. We are continuing our hard work on this project and appreciate your concern.
 

I hope this concludes the matter.",,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,flair-pyro,True,t3_1ehzvg,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1ehzvg/on_the_other_tf2center_post/,moderator

I will be discussing the merits of each of the weapons for these packs, and asking questions and your opinions.

**Soldier**

*Dr. Grordbort's Victory Pack*

&gt; Cow Mangler 5000

I think this weapon's unique abilities make it very situational. It's nice to shut off buildings like a sentry for an un-ubered Demoman push, but it also has a lot of downsides. It can't be crit-boosted, which already makes for a strike against it. A good soldier and a Kritzkrieg Medic can do a lot of work. It also deals only 20% damage to buildings which, added to its 10% base damage penalty, means that it only does 18% of the stock's damage to buildings. This is perhaps one of the soldier's most important jobs in most settings. One good thing is that it doesn't use ammo, but I hardly ever find myself out of rockets with the soldier, since any metal picked up turns into ammo. All in all, this weapon is useful for its novelty, but it is highly situational, and the Direct Hit can destroy a nest a whole lot easier. *Please discuss*

&gt; Righteous Bison

I personally really like the Bison. It doesn't use ammo, meaning you always have a short range weapon that won't damage you in close quarters. It penetrates targets, which is good in corridors or for spamming the cart in payload maps. The projectiles cannot be deflected, so you have a counter for a good Pyro when you don't want to get close enough to melee (see *Suicide*) and he's reflecting your rockets. It can also hit players multiple times, so it's like having pellets from a shotgun blast. It can also light Huntsman arrows on fire, which is just plain cool. The only downside is that it only does 20% damage to buildings, but if you're a soldier, there are easier things with which to destroy buildings than your shotgun. I personally use this weapon on my primary loadout, and I'd like to hear your thoughts. *Please discuss*

**Pyro**

*Dr. Grordbort's Moonman Pack*

&gt; Phlogistonator

We all know that the Phlogistonator can't airblast, which means that a Pyro can't protect himself, other players, or buildings. It also has a 10% damage penalty compared to stock, and there are no critical hits. Its only real bonus is its Mmmph meter which, when full, can be activated to restore you to full health and give you crits for a short time. This weapon can be good in pubs, where you'll probably have another Pyro who can airblast. However, whenever I use this weapon, I find it hard to stay alive long enough to use the Mmmph charge. This weapon is unique, but it is quite possibly the worst flamethrower. *Please discuss, but remember that we already know that it can't airblast*

&gt; Manmelter 

This weapon is unique and, in the hands of a good Pyro, can help the team out a lot. It has a 50% faster projectile speed compared to the Flare Gun, which means that you don't have to compensate as much for target movement when using it. There's no ammo, which means that you can spam with it indefinitely, if you want. Unlike the other flare guns, the projectile can't be deflected, meaning you have a counter for a good Pyro. Its Alt+Fire extinguishes players, and each extinguished player gives you 1 guaranteed crit, making this a good credit-to-team weapon (think Jarate fire pistol). It doesn't randomly crit, but this isn't a real drawback. I haven't gotten the chance to use this weapon, but when I see it used, I think it's a decent Pyro secondary. *Please Discuss*

&gt; Third Degree

This weapon has only one different stat, and that is that it will damage any players connected my Medigun beams. This makes for a good melee, especially since you as a Pyro usually have to get close to the enemy to do damage. I don't really know what to make of this weapon, but I see it as being good for rare Medic picks. Other than that, I'm not really sure what sets it apart from any other melee. *Please Discuss*

**Engineer**

*Dr. Grordbort's Braniac Pack*

&gt; Pomson 6000

Pew pew pew. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk Pomson. I love this weapon, and I usually favor it over the Justice for one reason: Spychecking. This weapon, when it hits a Spy, drains 20% of his cloak. You saw a flicker of movement? Shoot there, you may discover a Spy! If not, no worries. It doesn't need ammo, like many of the Grordbort weapons. It can also drain 10% of a Medic's Ubercharge, which is useful if you see a Medic and Demoman coming towards you. It also can't be deflected. However, it only does 20% damage to buildings, and it only holds 4 shots per clip, as opposed to 6. I use this weapon in my primary Engineer loadout. It isn't as offensive as the Frontier Justice or the Widowmaker, but it's nice to be able to deter your most potent threat. *Please discuss*

&gt; Eureka Effect

This is a wrench for the Engineer that only has 2 different stats. on right click, you can teleport to spawn to refill metal or get yourself out of a situation. This is very useful, but comes with a drawback. You can't carry buildings. Gotta move that gear up? Well, you'd better take out your demolition PDA, because you'll have to erect a dispenser somewhere else. This is good for defense, when you're not trying to push your position, but on offense, you're better off with the Jag. *Please discuss*

------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for taking the time to read this summary. Again, I know you all probably know most of this already, but I wanted to consolidate it into one place for a discussion forum about all of these weapons. I'd like to know, do you use any of these weapons? If so, what else do you use in your loadout to complement it?

Like the title said, I've found critfail to be a happy medium between the glorified pubs TF2 lobby has devolved into and the more complicated and serious pugs you find on #TF2NA and the other TF2 IRC channels. Critfail has its own web interface to pick teams and get people into the mumble and game servers, and announces pugs through the steam group 2-3 times a day. 

The downside of being in the middle is that critfail has a rather limited user base. There are only 217 members in the group, and it isn't uncommon for the events to end without games being started because of lack of activity. I strongly encourage anyone interested in some decent pick up games to sign up for the group and try out a game.

* You can't change class in the middle of the challenge  
* You have to use the Natascha  
* You have to play REAL Heavy!(no mittens Heavy, no Buffalo Steak Sandvich suicide rush ect ect)

The reason we're in plat first is because we just want to get our feet wet with these strategies before REALLY taking them on in open. I like to use the Market Gardener a lot and thought I might give a few instances where it's useful.

So we know its stats, does 195 damage on a successful hit, killing any class that took practically any damage that isn't overhealed, and insta-kills scouts that are overhealed, I'm just gonna give a list of what it's great at doing. I believe it is the perfect roamer weapon to run because with escape plan, you're likely to die anyways.

* Drops ubers because it instantly kills, the medic has no time to react.
* It is great for what I call, combo gardening or suicide gardening, fire a rocket at your enemy as you're flying towards them, and pull out your market gardener and slash them for 65/70+195 which instantly kills an overhealed demo even if he had taken NO damage previously.

* It is perfect for killing distracted pockets or medics.

* Great for denying jumps if you know a soldier will do a chain jump so he can't react to an airshot.

* With the combo gardening tactic, you can fool them into thinking you're just going to shoot all your rockets and then pull it out, which by then they hopefully wouldn't be able to react quick enough to airshot you because they thought you'd be somewhere else.

 
Now obviously, if they know you are coming it's not very smart to use the market gardener because they can dodge(even though you can counter their dodge, it isn't reliable enough, and lets you easily get airshot). My personal favorite is for destroying distracted demos because you land one gardener and one rocket, and even on a COMPLETELY overhealed demo it WILL kill him. It is the best weapon for just destroying pockets.

DISADVANTAGES: ITS NOT A FUCKING ESCAPE PLAN.

And thought I might say as well, if the player you are gardening jumped at all, not a sticky or rocket, just jumped, or is in midair when you garden him, he will eat the 195 damage plus about 25-40 fall damage.

So that's my mini summary of the advantages of this weapon, post your thoughts please :)

Personally, mine is that it seems a bit broken in that it gives the heavy anti-spy capabilities, which isn't really his thing. Heavy at a sentry nest staying spun up and getting ammo from dispenser could make a nest difficult if not impossible to clear as a spy. And 2-3 heavies with this thing on a payload cart (especially plr_pipeline stage 2) could just be terrifying. Not fun at all for enemy team.

My proposed nerf is this: No ammo recieved from dispensers (or payload cart).

What do you all think?

Edit: not to mention this completely screws over a Saharan spy looking to stab a heavy for his first disguise. You're on fire, totally obvious AND the slowest class in the game. Sucks to be me.

Edit 2: They also might have to spin down and up again a lot more, as staying revved up with no enemies immediately in sight costs serious ammo.

Edit 3: So if a heavy stays spun up on a level 3 dispenser, and puts out rings of fire around the entire nest, how does a spy ever get close? Plus the combined knockback from both a sentry and minigun could hinder if not neutralize an uber.

I'll try to keep this post fairly short, I just wanted to let you all know that I'm finally releasing version 3.5 of my HUD. At the bottom of this post, I'll quote my post on Teamfortress.tv; but essentially with this update comes an entirely redesigned main menu, in addition to throwing in a few more customization options and features. Also, to any of you who watched me stream my edits on this every single day for the past two weeks, I really appreciate it. It means a lot to me, and I'm glad that I was able to use all of your input to mold the HUD into what it is today.

Here's the tf.tv post:

http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/981-rayshud/12#post-355

&gt;**rayshud v3.5 is out!**

&gt;It includes the following changes:

&gt;-An alternate font that gives the 6s and 9s more pronounced curves. (They don't cut off half way). ***[NOT YET IN INSTALLER]***

&gt;-An indicator to show who's currently captured the central control point in a KOTH map.

&gt;-Fixed the winpanel dropshadow for the red team's score not being transparent to match its blue counterpart.

&gt;-A completely redesigned main menu.

&gt;-A completely redesigned backpack/loadout screen.

&gt;-A completely redesigned Mann Co. store.

&gt;-A completely redesigned lobby screen.

&gt;-A completely redesigned replay screen.

&gt;-A custom console/option/server browser window that matches the rest of the menu's color scheme.

&gt;-Convenient demoui/console buttons on the main menu.

&gt;-The ability to navigate through the majority of the in-game menus with the A/D keys.

&gt;-Updated the HUD to work with closed captions. (**closecaption 1** must be set in console to enable)

&gt;-Added in an alternate health cross in which the health number overlays itself onto the cross. ***[NORMAL HUD ONLY, NOT YET IN THE INSTALLER]***


&gt;You can download the update here: 

&gt;https://github.com/raysfire/rayshud/archive/0dbbcf4f455ab148efea70628d6d8f5de88ce693.zip

&gt;Or via the installer by Tree ***[CURRENTLY VERY BUGGY]***:

&gt;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18079550/rayshud%20installer%20v2%20steampipe.zip

&gt;___________

&gt;**ABOUT THIS UPDATE:**

&gt;*Album of new changes:* http://imgur.com/a/Fk7Ho

&gt;So, I finally decided that I needed to jump back into the world of HUD developing. I needed a summer project anyways; so this was more than enough. With this update comes a full menu redesign; and I just really want to thank everyone that supported me by watching me edit this live during my many, multiple-hour dull HUD editing sessions. It means a lot to me that you all watched, even though I was doing nothing but this for literally two weeks of my life when I streamed. 

&gt;As far as the installer and everything is concerned: While its technically working on the installer, its very buggy at the current time and prone to crash, depending on which setting you select or don't select. If the installer works for you, great, but if not, it'd really be helpful to both Tree and myself if you could grab the attached log.txt file that's generated in the same folder of the installer, throw its contents in a pastebin, and paste it in this thread so we can determine where things are breaking.

&gt;As far as the options to choose which version of the HUD font you use, or if you want to use the new health cross as your primary health display, these options will be added into the installer soon. Tree recently got back to a location where he can put in work on the installer again, so we can potentially see those coming out in later installer versions.

&gt;___________

&gt;**TO INSTALL THE NEW HEALTH CROSS:**

&gt;[Health cross image](http://puu.sh/43rYM.jpg)

&gt;In order to install the new heatlh cross, it's just a simple file replace. First, navigate to your HUD's install directory, (so in many cases it's ""tf/custom/mystuff"", or ""tf/custom/rayshud"")

&gt;Once there, go into first the resource folder, then the UI folder. Navigate to the ""HudPlayerHealth.res"" section. There should be three files.

&gt;Once you've found them, first, delete the ""HudPlayerHealth.res"" file completely. Once its gone, right-click the file labeled ""HudPlayerHealth-broeselcross.res"", and rename it previous file's name, simply ""HudPlayerHealth.res"". If you're in game, you should then type ""hud_reloadscheme"" into console. If not, then start up the game and you're good to go.

&gt;___________

&gt;**TO INSTALL THE ALTERNATE FONT:**

&gt;[Alternate font image](http://puu.sh/43rJy)

&gt;Same as the health cross, simply navigate to your HUD files again. This time all you need to do is open up your resource folder.

&gt;Once there, using the method explained above, replace the files ""Cerbetica_edited"" and ""Cerbetica_bold"" with ""Cerbetica_edited-alt"" and ""Cerbetica_bold-alt"". 

&gt;*Be aware that this can't be done while TF2 is currently running.*

&gt;___________

&gt;**KNOWN HUD BUGS:**

&gt;-The notification that appears on the main menu to signify that you have a new item is cut off.

At the start of each round, the equivalent of $1 USD is deduced from the wallet. At the end of each round, members of the winning team receive $2 USD (possibly minus administrative/server fees of around $0.05 USD). Players can withdraw the balance of their server wallet (in Bitcoins) at any time.

I'd like to also add features so that more can be wagered if a majority of the players in a round agree, and perhaps a feature wherein the payout is proportional to the number of kills/score of each player on the winning team.

The long-reigning champions of European TF2 must finally cut their break short, as the grand finals date now approaches. Epsilon eSports should be fresh off of a three week period of relaxation, while they watched the other playoff times scratching and clawing at each other. Their opponents, Broder, have made it here with some rather close victories: 5-3 and 6-4 over BFF, and then 6-3 and 5-4 over Crack Clan. While those three teams often challenge each other, has the experience Broder gained from these playoffs been enough? In the regular season, Epsilon took down Broder in most convincing fashion, winning 6-1 on Badlands and 5-0 on Snakewater. That will no doubt cause some mental hurdles for Zebbosai's squad as they roll into the final official of ETF2L's S14 Powered by Twitch.tv.

For those of you who don't know, Tightrope is a community run beta that was created because people were getting fed up with Valve's lack of testing new items. Here is a list of all the item changes they are testing at the moment, and all previous changes they've tested:

http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Tightrope

Now, I think Tightrope is a great idea. The TF2 beta has never really been used to it's fullest potential and this seems like it could be a viable alternative. However, I have a very hard time taking Tightrope itself seriously. Many of their changes seem poorly thought out, and I'm dubious of the qualifications of their testers. Namely that they're just anyone who plays on their servers and goes on their forums. Now while a community run beta is a good idea, I'd have to say that the community running the beta should be one that knows about the game. Remember that SPUF is a part of the TF2 community too, and a very large part at that. I just can't kick the feeling that Tightrope is essentially just where motivated SPUF users go to try getting their crazy ideas implemented.

Now, I know I'm not being fair here. The Tightrope team is dedicated, and they work hard on what they do. However, I still can't bring myself to take Tightrope seriously. I was wondering if you all felt the same way I do, or if I should just get over myself. Also, no matter if you take Tightrope seriously or not I'd still like to hear your reason for feeling the way you do.

1357945589.0,37,self.truetf2,16en7h,UGC Season Starting Soon :: A guide for new teams,UbiquitousMan,44,7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/16en7h/ugc_season_starting_soon_a_guide_for_new_teams/,"The next season of the UGC is approaching fast! Here is a guide for new and returning teams to help them get off on the right foot.


First a word to those teams returning for next season: make sure your team leader has set your team status as READY so that you will be scheduled here in the coming weeks and allow us to sort and organize the divisions with a clear understanding of all the teams who are returning. To see if your team's status is set to ready, search for your team here: [HIGHLANDER](http://www.ugcleague.com/rankings_tf2h_all.cfm) and [SIXES](http://www.ugcleague.com/rankings_tf26.cfm) look for the GREEN status box to the right of your team. Thanks!


As always, if anyone has any questions that I don't answer below, you can always email the UGC admins at tf2@ugcleague.com
I would also recommend every team leader watches [Moose's Walkthrough Video for Team Leaders](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ou0oYhBoy-E)



**IMPORTANT DATES**
Highlander season starts **JAN. 21st**
6s season starts **JAN 23rd**



Thinking of adding a team still? There is still time!!
Dont have a full roster? There are TONS of people looking to join a team [HERE](http://www.ugcleague.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=6)




**Divisions**


* Platinum: This is the highest division for both 6s and Highlander. Almost all the players have multiple seasons under their belt. The cream of the crop.
* Gold: NEW This is a new division for highlander. It is comprised of all the returning Platinum teams from last season with a record under .500 and all the returning Silver teams from last season with a record over .500 plus a few tip top Steel, and a few newly created teams of players who fit the Gold skill division. Players here might have experience in platinum, can play at some of the highest levels of competitive play. This is going to be an extremely competitive division this season!
* Silver: Highlander division. Will be made up all the Silver teams from last season without winning records + all the Steel teams with winning records who were not moved up to gold + the top Iron teams of last division. Players in Silver mostly have at least 1 or two seasons of experience. They understand the concepts within competitive TF2.
* Steel: Steel division has always been one of the largest and diverse divisions in the UGC. There is a steel division for 6s and well as Highlander. Steel teams are made up of a wide range of skill levels from a few Plat players hanging out with their friends and ESEA pros, to brand new players to the competitive scene. Teams in steel usually have at least 1 season or have teams made up of players who know the basics of competitive play.
* Iron: Highlander division. New teams start here. This is a division for new players and teams to the competitive scene. Its where you learn about comp tf2, get your feet wet in actual structured competition. The best thing you can do here is just show up. Play. Gain experience. There is a lot of talent hiding in the Iron division waiting to be tapped. 


*A Note About Divisions*  A lot of teams were moved or have requested division changes. We are waiting to see the total number of teams coming back and what the rosters are going to look like on each team. The divisions are not what they were last season either. If you were a high steel team last season, chances are you will be a top silver team this season. Admins will be going over the rosters this weekend, looking through all the division change requests, and moving teams as well if we believe they are placed in the wrong divisions currently. We will start by looking at your previous record in your past division followed by your roster and their individual past experience. We can not take into consideration anyone saying they are offclassing or just riding the bench. If your on their roster you will be counted towards that teams strength. 



**What do I need if I want to make a team?**

* New team sign up forms can be completed here: http://www.ugcleague.com/join.cfm
* Teams are asked to have their own private server with 13 or 19 slots for sixes and highlander respectively. The additional slot is for the Match STV recorder which records .demos of all your games. The UGC does have servers availible for teams who can not provide their own but they fill up quick so be sure to email your admins to reserve ASAP.
* Get the UGC files on your servers. Visit the [Highlander Files](http://www.ugcleague.com/files_tf2h.cfm) or the [Sixes Files](http://www.ugcleague.com/files_tf26.cfm). You will need the right config file for each game type. The rcon command to exec the files in game is: rcon exec (CONFIG_NAME.cfg)  for example: rcon exec ugc_HL_koth.cfg  PLEASE NOTE: You need to restart the map after you exec the config to make sure its running properly!
* You can also download all the maps needed for this season on the Files page. The maps being played are: For [6s](http://www.ugcleague.com/maplist_tf26.cfm), for [HL](http://www.ugcleague.com/maplist_tf2h.cfm)
* Log into your leader login on the site, fill out your roster, and wait to be scheduled. Once you are scheduled you can talk to the other team leader in match comms to make any changes, requests, pass server information. All that information is in Moose's video linked above.
* After your match **REPORT THE MATCH SCORE**!! If you do not report the match score right after your match it could cause the match to go unreported and errors could occur. It happens every season. The winning team logs into their leader login, marks the match as ""played"" and fills out the score for each round. 




If you have questions on anything, you can add and instant message your division admin, or we recommend joining our IRC channel on the Gamesurge network   #ugc-tf2



Another resource players and teams have is the UGC Mentoring system. Check out the [mentoring forums](http://www.ugcleague.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=15) to find help!

It's Monday again(at least for me) and that means another challenge. This time, we are going to use a Scout weapon! No it's not the Force-a-Nature. No, it's not the Baby Face Blaster. It's in fact, Mann Co.'s latest in high altitude break-action personal defense line of products!  
  
Yes people! It is the:  
  
##SHORTSTOP  
Let me tell you, this little gun packs one hell of a punch.  
Lets go over what this gun actually does.  
  
* Has 42% firing speed  
* Deals 100% more damage per pellet  
* Has clip-based reload(meaning, if you still have ammo in your clip when you're reloading, you will lose that ammo)  
* Has 60% fewer pellets
* Has 33% smaller clip size
* Draws ammo from the same ammo pool as the secondary pistols  
  
This gun offers a different playstyle than what the Scout usually does. Instead of running in and landing those powerful meatshots, you can now stay at a middle distance from the enemy and deal powerful damage. It have overall less damage than the Scattergun and is harder to hit things with it due to the smaller pellet size, but the faster firing speed and damage makes up for it. Overall, I consider this to be a valid sidegrade to the Scattergun, but I rarely see it being used in the game. Therefor, I challenge you guys to use it.  
  
**RULES**  
There's a change in the rules today, so you better read these.  
  
* You have to play Scoutfor at least 1 hour  
* Can't change class in the middle of the challenge  
* You have to use this weapon  
* You can use whatever loadout you want EXCEPT for The Special Delivery set! I want your opinion on this gun, not the whole set. You are, however, allowed to use the Holy Mackerel and the Mad Milk WITHOUT the Milkman hat.  
  
That's all the information I deem you need. Now, go out there and pester some Heavies With this powerful little toy!

This includes stats, achievements, keybinds, and much more. The Steamcloud allows you to save your settings to their servers so that information you save can be quickly retrieved if you reinstall or change computers. The issue is that a lot of saved changes, especially custom configs, can leave traces of their old commands lingering in your Steamcloud meaning that regardless of whether you've deleted it from your autoexec or your class' .cfg files they may still be around. If you follow these steps you can completely remove most of these commands and perform a factory reset.

**Warning** it will clear all of your replays, even saved ones, and revert TF2 back to it's original install state. You will lose your .cfgs. All maps/sounds/mods will be removed. To back them up be sure to copy and save your /cfg and /maps folders and if you have any custom skins or HUD save your /resources / scripts folders somewhere besides your steam/team fortress/ folder. You will not lose any items, achievements, friends, but you will have to deal with the new player tips coming back and your favorites possibly being wiped (mine weren't). Doing this completely saved my TF2 performance because I had old commands that were fighting with new ones after I've changed my configs and upgraded machines over the last few years. 

* Right click steam icon in tray, click settings, go to tab ""Download+Cloud"" and ENABLE the option ""Enable Steam Cloud Synchronisation for games which support it""
open steam, go to library, right click TF2, properties, tab updates, UNTICK the option ""Enable Steam Cloud Synchronisation for Team Fortress 2"". Then go to the first tab, and click ""set launch options"" and clear ANY thats there.


* Right click steam icon in tray, click settings, go to tab ""Download+Cloud"" and DISABLE the option ""Enable Steam Cloud Synchronisation for games which support it""
Start TF2, Options, Multiplayer, UNTICK the option ""synchronize with the steam cloud"" near end. Close TF2.
Close Steam (as in, click in the tray and choose EXIT)


* press winkey + R (winkey = between CTRL and ALT lower left of keyboard) and type in: ""regedt32"" without the """" and press OK. Browse to: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Source\Tf\ and delete the ""settings"" subfolder.

* Go to ..\steam\steamapps*your account name here*\Team fortress 2\"" delete ALL but the ""tf"" folder.

* Go to ..\steam\steamapps*your account name here*\Team fortress 2\tf\"" delete ALL but the ""maps"" folder.

* Go to ..\steam\steamapps*your account name here*\Team fortress 2\tf\maps"" delete ALL subfolders but not the files within the ""maps"" folder.



Steamcloud needs to be turned OFF, and kept that way because there is NO way to fully delete what is up there, you get it downloaded everytime you start TF2, if you want it or not, if you changed it or not etc. the only thing they do is up the config of your when you close the game. And of that, I'm not even sure.  I've seen things come back that I had set in a autoexec.cfg differently EVERYTIME I launched the game. No idea why it is default on. Sure would not want that.
the only settings it is NOT resetting is the ""rate"" value in the game, that one is for some strange reason located in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve\Steam\ key ""rate"" value... depends on what you had set it. Default is 10.000.
""steamcloud"" is saving locally the settings in: ..\steam\userdata\""xxxxxxxx""... (with a \440\ subfolder in it)

You can still sign up your team after January 9. Teams signing up later than January 9 will be placed on the waiting list and have a very high chance of replacing dead or dropping teams during the first three play weeks.

----------------------------

Map Pool

Turbine has proven to be the least popular map of Season 13′s map pool, and thus it has been removed. In Season 14, we will put an emphasis on mastering a smaller pool of maps, all of which are well-known and popular throughout all levels of play.

* Week 1: cp_badlands/cp_gullywash_final1
* Week 2: cp_badlands/cp_snakewater
* Week 3: cp_snakewater/cp_gullywash_final1
* Week 4: cp_gullywash_final1/cp_process_rc2
* Week 5: cp_process_rc2/cp_snakewater
* Week 6: cp_process_rc2/cp_granary
* Week 7: cp_granary/cp_badlands

The Unlocks

Based on the feedback from the 6th Cup, we have decided to break the status quo and introduce the Cup’s unlocks into our regular 6v6 League. We believe that these carefully chosen unlocks will add more variety and tactical depth to 6v6 across all skill levels.

The complete list of unlocks allowed in Season 14 is as follows:

* The Kritzkrieg
* The Übersaw
* Crusader’s Crossbow
* The Blutsauger
* The Overdose
* The Gunboats
* The Boston Basher
* The Pain Train
* The Escape Plan

**Additional S9 Notes:** It appears the whitelist will remain exactly the same with the exception of cosmetic items.  Also infinite said that ""there will be double elimination playoffs for some teams"", which to me implies that the league intends to add a gold division between plat and silver.  It's worth mentioning that this will be the first UGC HL season without pl_upward.

When one player isn't pulling their weight they might hear a word or two, but for the most part it doesn't become an issue. When a team suffers balance issues someone might rudely proclaim ""*my team is shit*"" but seldom does one player get singled out and blamed; this is an important thing to note.

A 6 player team in MvM will likely be much more sensitive to deadweight, when someone doesn't pull their weight the rest of the players will actually feel the pressure. Take Left4Dead co-op for example, all survivors depend on another intimately and when one is making mistakes, wandering off, or slow at clearing common infected the other players suffer. So players are quick to single out the weak player and blame them. This can be an unfriendly atmosphere to say the least, rage feeding on itself as players look to point out mistakes of others who criticized them earlier in an increasingly negative circle of resentment. If the amount of rage in MvM is anything approaching 6's lobbies, Left4Dead, or god forbid DOTA-likes then we may have some unpleasant experiences on the horizon.

Most worrying of all, players in TF2 may have radically different strategies. Certainly on a pub you have some players that view TF2 as a game of tug-of-war measured in frags, they want everyone to keep attacking, keep putting 'pressure' on the enemy until they are driven back. Then you have players with a very different strategy: hold position and stay alive until they have an uber, then push in all at once with the rest of their team. 

My question is how do you think the TF2 playerbase will fair in these regards? Could two such players ever work together using a strategy one might not agree with?

I had to actually sit around and think about how I respond to certain situations to even consider how it's actually shaped. After a bit of thought, I'm pretty sure the airblast exists as a giant cube, similar to the way projectiles treat our models. I have deduced this based on, not only my experience playing, but that it would make it more intuitive and it would better match your monitor's rectangular shape. Is this true and if so, is it distributed evenly on your screen and centered on your crosshair? Does that mean it's protruding closer to your head than your feet? Does changing your viewmodel from right to left handed make any difference in airblasting or is it literally where you are looking + a square hitbox in front of you?

**Predictions**

bp &gt; 12 5-3 by highwayunicorn

bp took one look at their slow start to scrims and said ""this isn't good enough."" They are now undefeated through four games, losing a total of three rounds to their LAN competitors. Shrugger looks more dominant than anyone had expected, cyzer's damage is on par with some pocket soldiers, Lansky is cementing himself as a top pocket, and b4nny is still b4nny; there are not many bad things to say about bp at this point. Torqued are on a bit of a hot streak themselves, meanwhile, after switching up their roster with Seagull doing tons of damage and Seanbud/Justin being a surprisingly good pair as the cleanup crew. Really, the thing that has turned their play around the most is PYYYOUR finding his groove and looking like one of the best demoman in the game. Now he gets the truest test of a demoman's capabilities - b4nny. Expect bp to continue their dominance, but Seagull and PYYYOUR will put out enough damage to keep Torqued in it to the bitter end.

With it, depending on the sensitivity, I can do a instant 360 turn on a dime. I can easily turn around corners to surprise enemies, I can spin around on one spot to get a critical hit without moving from that spot and together with a explosive jump(with a grenade or something) or a Trimp, I can fly the distance to each spawn on plr_hightower by Charge Strafing.  
  
It have been a lot of fun doing it, but now I want to ask you guys here on TrueTF2:  
  
Would it be good to give the Demoman the ability to turn on a dime naturally without the use of controllers to bridge the gap between Stock Demoman and DemoKnight?  
I will not deny the fact that Stock Demo is the best Demo. There's no other loadout is as powerful. However, by giving the DemoKnight this ability, he will now be able to get kills around corners, which the Stock Demo can do with stickies. He can now charge against a opponent without getting himself killed because he can almost instantly dodge the attack by turning, making him infinity more effective since the only kills he can get at the moment on mediocre players with charging is by surprise flank attacks.

It's looking like the North American version is happening real soon, thanks to two server providers that have contacted me. Starting with at least 2 Chicago-based servers. 
More providers and locations are still very welcome, so [contact me!](http://steamcommunity.com/id/ariekanarie)


**original post**

Hi truetf2!

I'm Arie from FakkelBrigade and I've made a [reservation system](http://server.fakkelbrigade.eu) for TF2 gameservers. Thanks to [a bunch of community heroes](http://server.fakkelbrigade.eu/pages/server_providers) there are now [16 gameservers](http://server.fakkelbrigade.eu/pages/servers) in 6 different European data centers to choose from. Every day about [100 reservations are made](http://server.fakkelbrigade.eu/pages/recent_reservations) and [the total](http://server.fakkelbrigade.eu/pages/statistics) reservations is getting close to 5000.

So why should you care about this system?

* Many different server locations, so you can find a server with a good ping for most players
* Automatically loads the config and whitelist for your reservation
* Instant zip with the logs/demos of a match when you end your reservation
* Automatic uploads to logs.tf when you enter your API key
* Manual upload to logs.tf, for those without a logs.tf account
* It's the best way to deal with TF2 match servers imo ;)

As you can see on the [servers page](http://server.fakkelbrigade.eu/pages/servers), it's currently a purely European system, but I'm trying to set up a NA version.

For that, I need your help: Maybe you are or know a NA community member that runs a dedicated server and would be willing to provide a gameserver. Or perhaps you'd be willing to host the NA version of this system (it's Rails and a cronjob, for you techies).

So yeah, let me know here, or [add me on steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/ariekanarie) also if you have any suggestions or feedback, I'd really appreciate it.",,False,,t5_2stfn,1367855117.0,,flair-scout,True,t3_1dqctw,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1dqctw/free_server_reservation_system/,

I didn't really research this decision and just went with a UGC sponsor.  

After 2 months with them, I know I won't be renewing.  The problems:

1. lag, all the time.   Some of our team is affected worse than others.  I moved the server from Chicago to Dallas, same deal.  
2. disk failure wiped out the server, they keep no backups.  They claim it's because ""petabytes"" of data, but this is a cop-out: most of those petabytes are game data and maps. Backing up the text configs would take very little space.
3. when #2 happened, they didn't notice on their own.  I had to waste time trying to start a dead server and then log a ticket to get it fixed.
4. day-long outage while they moved datacenters across town (for comparison, Dreamhost moved my website across the country and it was down for only a few minutes).
5. server stopped auto-updating, for some reason, about a month ago.  Now I have to log a support ticket every time tf2 updates.
6. fastDL not included, they want extra for that.
7. no mumble/teamspeak etc included either.  

nfoservers/tragicservers include voice+fastdl and charge a lower price.  ~~I'll be trying them next.~~ (EDIT: multiple reports of sub-par routing, owing to NFO's use of InterNAP.  And tragic spams tf2lobby chat.  The search continues).

I've been seeing a lot of ""how do I?"" threads on forums and throughout Reddit's TF2 community. Often someone will say ""I want to learn how to do X, Y, and Z. I've played a couple lobbies but still need help.""

Listen. Friends. Announcers. Casters. CBear. Lobbies do not count as competitive play. They are more like organized and formatted pubs where [mostly] competitive players meet because they don't have enough members of two teams to schedule a PUG (and often times people are going to goof off).

Here are some essential elements that will most likely be missing from a lobby, but are required in a PUG, scrim, or tournament match to actually *learn* something.

* Communication (Voice comms. Lobbyists often don't use the mic). 
* Strategy (""Which way are we rolling out?"" *\*silence*\*
* Consistent skill composition (Often people are playing classes they do not main and thus the overall skill level of the team has been lowered)

Now I'm not saying that ""playing lobbies is bad, m'kay"",  *what I am saying* is that, while getting lobby experience can be good, **lobbies are not a good way to gauge your skill set**. Lobbies are a good tool to become familiar with the flow of a map - *that's about it*. You might be spending more time and energy waiting for other people to join the game, than you do getting in actual play time or having peers to share advice with.

That's why I recommend you get your butts on over to [UGC](http://www.ugcleague.com) and try to find yourself a team. Don't be shy either! If you consider yourself a lower level player, find an Iron division team to play with. If you already know about UGC or ETF2L, that's great, but the main point is what to understand when you are looking for in advice.

Current champions  SNSD quite literally define the movie on which this gamemode took it’s name from, Immortality – unbeaten in 30 Highlander matches in nearly 2 years and 5 seperate competitions. Tonight they will face the current top seeded team in North America’s UGC Platinum division,  The Syndicate who feature some big names in both 6v6 and 9v9 such as  Ruwin and spy sensation  Stabby stabby as we welcome some of America’s finest in terms of both casters and players. Tonight on VanillaTV we have  Salamancer from eXtelevision here to join Europe’s best (as voted for by you, the brainwashed viewers) caster  Admirable and myself just to keep those bad boys in check, just in case anyone tries to abuse their fame in some way. Last but not least, just to make sure we have a quality setup all across the board,  Comedian will take control of the stream and handle the technical side of the production so we have a smooth game all night.

1342271184.0,38,self.truetf2,wjqe9,Comp TF2 seems to be dying without Valve's support. Is there anything we can do to save it?,postgoingup,65,27,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/wjqe9/comp_tf2_seems_to_be_dying_without_valves_support/,"*I posted this in r/tf2, as well [ http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/wjq1o/comp_tf2_seems_to_be_dying_without_valves_support/ ] , but this might be a more fitting forum for discussion.*

I've been involved in Team Fortress 2's competitive scene for a long time. Even though it's an incredibly dynamic, challenging, and ever-entertaining side of TF2 with so much potential to flourish, I've seen **no significant growth** in the comp scene within this time.

What I *have* seen is much more disheartening. Almost as if it were a trend, a number of great players with incredible skill and innovative playstyles have been quitting TF2 to instead focus on games that would be more financially rewarding to play competitively: Starcraft 2, Quake, League of Legends, and so on.

What is it that causes these games to be rewarding for their players to get involved in seriously, whereas playing Team Fortress 2 competitively seems to be regarded as a hobby with an inevitable dead end? As Team Fortress 2 holds truly remarkable and captivating competitive gameplay, I believe the difference lies in the game companies' treatment of the comp scenes.

A healthy mix of engaging gameplay and consistent promotion from the company in order to inform users of the comp scenes, and to therefore expand the competitive user base, is what makes LANs like [this](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5329/6924529142_20f1faf9e7_z.jpg) and [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUXHY6CnIR0) possible.

Valve, unfortunately, seems to almost ignore its competitive scene. With TF2's userbase being large and dedicated enough to bring in over 5 million views in less than 3 weeks on a short *made for mostly entertainment purposes!* (Meet the Pyro), there's no reason why a TF2 LAN should not bring in as much attention, or even a *comparable* amount of attention, as the one shown above. Such, however, is not the case, and you're lucky if a comp LAN is even coming up.

I have met a large number of TF2 players in my life. Only a fraction of those have even been aware of comp TF2's existence. Not only have the competitive players essentially **designed comp TF2 on their own**, along with incredible competitive tools and resources like MyGamingEdge, TF2Lobby, numerous eSports streams and casts, and more... but it's as if the comp players are having to build the hype up on their own, too. And as long as comp players feel as if they're having to struggle to keep comp TF2 alive and keep the playerbase interested despite there being minimum rewards in investing true dedication in being a great comp player... then comp TF2 will continue to be at the risk of dying.

If Valve would so much as put a button on their page or in the game itself which had at least *some* reference to comp TF2 -- something to tell TF2's huge playerbase, ""Hey! We're here! You have an option to play this way!"" -- I would be happy. But the way it is now, with feeling like the comp TF2 world is some sort of parallel, forgotten ghost world to TF2's pubs... I don't see *myself* as holding the passion to play any longer.

What do you all think should be done, if anything at all? What do you all think *can* be done?

Edit: ringl-bells brought up the point of Valve blog posts which have mentioned tournaments. I am aware of these and am incredibly happy when they do this. My problem is that these blog posts are irregular and I'm not sure what percentage of TF2 players would be exposed to current or previous blog posts at any given time. I think Valve should be providing a means of exposure for comp TF2 that is much more consistent.

Yes, long-rang bomb defusal for the Pyro! This can come in handy for sticky traps.

2. It has splash damage!
That's right. When it hits a world item, the flare explodes (albeit with a smaller splash range than with manual detonation). The splash damage ignites too, so you can miss that sniper and still set him on fire. Think of it as a fast-flying incendiary Direct Hit rocket.

3. The explosion can ignite multiple people
You can fire your flare straight into a crowd of 10 Snipers, explode it (preferably manually) and ignite them all. Bliss.

Also, if you want to flarejump and can't consistently do it, here's a good script;
alias +flarejump ""+duck;+jump;+attack;wait 5;+attack2;""
alias -flarejump ""-duck;-jump;-attack;wait 5;-attack2;""

I've put ~23 hours of my ~3 days playing it into soldier, and I can generally hold my own on pub servers. My biggest issue is when a medic foolishly wastes their uber on me. When it happens, I lock up. I just have no idea what to do. Do I run out towards the opponent and fire rockets until I have to reload? Do I take out my shotgun and try to hit as many people as possible? When the uber runs out and I'm in the middle of the open, how do I not die?

My other problem is that I can't think while I'm being ubered. I get too nervous to make the right decision. To give you an idea of how my brain shuts down, I once took out my Equalizer (god i'm an idiot) and tried to take out a sentry that was singlehandedly stopping my team from capping the final point... while the engie was right there, hitting it with a wrench and being healed by a nearby dispenser. Something about knowing that the medic trusted me to use the fleeting seconds of invincibility wisely prevents me from doing just that.

&gt;Hey guys, the second edition of the rayshud installer is out for testing. At the current time, only one crosshair can be added and not all crosshairs/resolutions are supported just yet (only 1920x1080 right now, sorry guys!), but the rest of the features should work just fine.

&gt;Included in this new version are the following features:
 
&gt;* The ability to backup previous versions of your hud (stored in the folder rayshud_backups in your tf folder)
* The ability to change your own health colors
* The option to enable a health cross/team colored border
* The ability to change your own ammo colors
* The ability to choose between effects/customize low ammo colors
* The ability to change damage number size, color, and outline
* The ability to change the last damage done location and color
* The ability to change the color of the Ubercharge bar
* The ability to change the effect/customize colors for an uber
* The ability to change the chatbox location
* The ability to toggle between the oldschool, middle team/class select screens and the new left team/class select screens
* The ability to enable spy disguise images
 
&gt;&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;To install, all you have to do is simply extract the zip anywhere on your computer, and in the folder, run the exe. If your version of rayshud is up to date, the bar at the top should be green. If it's not installed, the bar should be grey. If your version is out of date, the bar should be red.

&gt;Future updates will include:

&gt;* Heal Number Color Changing
&gt;* A more user friendly crosshair tab
* Multiple Crosshairs
* Saving setting selections between sessions (mostly works, but crosshairs continue to cause issues)
* Add the rest of the crosshair shapes (fighter pilot, konr wings,  ect)
* Working Previews
* A ton of other stuff

**Predictions**

AG &lt; check 2-5 by dearjohncarter

Chess Club are to the point where they cannot take bad losses. Losing to the playoff eliminated Apocalypse Gaming would definitely qualify. CC looked surprisingly adequate up against the new Mixup lineup last week, in spite of the 5-1 score, but have had it easy with two forfeit wins against Don't Trip. AG ran into a double 5-1 against two of the top three teams, and just look a little outclassed and out of gas. I expect a pretty comfortable Chess Club win, with some pro tier gaming coming from boomer and tri.

**Predictions**

Menace to Society  &gt; The Syndicate  2-1 Courtesy of Pudding Cup

Obviously match of the week right here, and I couldn't have even chosen a better map for these two teams to butt heads on. Well maybe upward could have been better to recreate last season's platinum finals, but badwater will do just fine to set the stage with bitterness and rivalry. Syndicate will be fielding shrugger on scout and mangachu on demo this week for the first time so we will have to wait and see just how much of an impact these players can make. I personally went out for drinks with stabby a couple days ago where he told me he had a lot of confidence in mangachu as a demo, but they're going to need more than confidence to stack up against the crew from mTs. Not many people will argue that xalox isn't the best demo in highlander right now and ukm has been consistently putting up very impressive frag numbers week after week. The real threat of mTs, though, lies with their silent carry--harbleu on medic. He's rarely caught out of position, he builds ubers like no one else, and he knows just how to prioritize his heals on top of calling most of the plays. The key for Syndicate to beat mTs is to keep killing harbleu and maintaining precious uber advantage. Without vhalin and ruwin to get the med picks this is going to be a very tough match for our season 8 champions. Stabby, jake, and shrugger will have to make a lot of magic happen this week--no pressure.

**Version 2.92**

It contains:

* -Arena mode support.
*  -Fighter pilot crosshairs for all three aspect ratios. (4x3, 16x9, and 16x10)
* -Removed background on notification messages. (Intel dropped/picked up, etc.)
* -Various MvM fixes.
* -A fix that prevents kills/deaths getting cut off when you're at 200+ kills.
* -Added in metal gained/lost animation.
* -Added in support for intro videos.

Here's a link to the tf.tv post, in case you guys would like to check it out further (and download it): [rayshud](http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/981-rayshud/1)

Any questions, concerns, or comments are appreciated. I haven't been getting a lot of feedback on it, so I dunno if I'm doing anything wrong or not. :P 

**I felt super bad about posting my updates on reddit, so I made a steam group. Please join it to know whenever I put out an update. Thank you. :3**

http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rayshud

**What's new in Version 2.9:**

* -Custom build/destroy menus (including Pipboy!).
* -Changing of the respawn timer color in the tournament spectator hud, to make it stand out more.
* -A few padding errors on the tournament spectator hud.
* -Fixed team names getting cut off in the winpanel. 

**Version 2.91 hotfix:**

* -A fix for the concise disguise menu.


**Download Link** - [rayshud version 2.91](https://github.com/downloads/raysfire/rayshud/rayshudv291.zip)

Anyways, this should end my reign of updates every two days. At this point, everything should be added into the game for it to be functioning properly. If you have any issues or need help, you're welcome to continue posting here. I'll probably be updating it periodically as I find more small errors, but for the most part, it's completely finished.

I may make a minmode version in a few weeks as people have asked for that, and it seems like it'd be a fun project, and of course, I'll make sure to keep this thing updated after every update. 

Anyways, a big thanks to all of you for supporting me, and helping me work out the bugs. 

&lt;3 you all.

Specifically their behavior when low on health. 

I thought I would write down some of my observations, then ask you to do the same. Hopefully we all learn something about recognizing an opportunity and exploiting it properly! 

**Please Note: These observations have been made during comp *and pub* gameplay, obviously better players will compensate, and not all examples will apply to all scenarios and formats. YMMV**

* Heavy

Someone who is playing heavy, is playing heavy because they want to get kills. The only direction a heavy will move is toward the fight, unless they are critically low on health or ammo. Be watching for early spin downs and running in straight lines. 

A good heavy knows to hug walls and corners in order to minimize his hitbox. If he is running in the open in a straight line, he is making a beeline for health or ammo, dont let him get it.

* Soldier

Soldiers strive to maximize their mobility in all situations. Obviously, every time you see one with an Escape Plan out that should be a free kill, but even just staying grounded indicates a soldier either too weak to RJ, or one who is unable to RJ. In the latter case, you know his exact capabilities, and should be able to position yourself for a win. 

* Demo

Watch for his primary. Most demos will have the stickies out to do maximum spam damage when they are healthy and attacking. A demo showing pills is usually either feeling defensive, or has a trap up somewhere in his line of sight.

* Pyro

When critically low on health, one of the pyros' only options is to charge with the flames and hope you die first, since she lacks the mobility and ranged weapons to cover a retreat. Obviously this is not always the case in comp, as the pyro is either an expendable uber blocker, or near enough to the combo/nest to get heals. Still, in these comp situations, a defensive pyro will suicide before they retreat. 

* Scout

This one is tricky for me. Because they dodge so well, and put out so much damage up close, a good scouts movement wont really change with lower health, unless they see an overwhelming force approaching.

* Spy

Skilled spies will resort to trickstabs when caught out or injured. Watch for stair and cornerstabs. If the spy has a good chunk of HP left they will usually resort to the revolver; when dangerously low, on the other hand, they will usually bum rush with the knife and hope you go for the melee kill and the matador. 

* Medic

A good medic will always behave as if he is injured. He will hide behind his pocket, abuse corners, and run when he sees the fight is a loosing one. Watch for primary and melee weapon switching, and switching main heal targets. If he abandons his heavy for a demo farther back, its probably because the heavy is taking more DPS than his HPS can account for-get ready to jump.     

* Sniper

Not much to say about this one. I'm not often close enough to lit snipers to see how they handle it. I would assume a sniper going for no-scopes would be a panicked sniper. 

* Engineer 

Another relatively simple one. 
L3 Engineers come in two flavors: Full health, and Spawning. If their nest went down, they probably took a fair bit of damage in the process, and will be +w'ing back to the cabinet. 

A gunslinger engi will turn tail, and attempt to lead you back to his ~~fun killer~~ minisentry. Know the standard gun placements, and watch for panicked doging and +w'ing toward them. 


* Those are my observations on movement under fire. Did I miss anything? Am I totally off base? Is my formatting so bad that its unreadable? Was everything here totally obvious and not need to be said aloud?

**CEVO Announces Team Fortress 2: Highlander Revival Tournament**


A lot of things are undead. Zombies are undead, vampires are undead when they're not sparkly, Five Iron Frenzy is undead, that one twinkie I had on Halloween when I was in middle school was undead. Now, back from the halls of Valhalla with a newly sharpened thirst for blood that needs immediate quenching (and is also undead) is, my friends, the Highlander Revival Tournament


**Team Registration**

Registration for this event will open IMMEDIATELY and will close on Thursday, June 14th at Midnight EST. Teams will consist of no fewer than 9 players in order to be considered ""ready"".


**Tournament Format**

The tournament will have a double-elimination format, where the loser of a match will be bumped down to the lower bracket where they will have to win consecutive matches to stay in the tournament.

Teams need a minimum of 7 players to participate in a match and may not have more than 9 players on the field at any one time.


**Gameplay Format**

As the name suggests, this tournament will be running a highlander format with one of each class.

The banlist is as follows:
Sandman, Atomizer, Cow Mangler, Righteous Bison, Phlogistinator, Manmelter, Splended Screen, Ullapool Caber, Holiday Punch, Pomson, Wrangler, Vita-Saw, Machina, Spy-Cicle, Reserve Shooter, Bombinomicon are all BANNED. Any items released during the tournament are also banned, regardless of whether or not the whitelist allows them.

Matches will be played to 30 minutes and the team with the most captures at the end of the match or the team with a cumulative win-difference of 5 will be declared the winner or the team that captures faster in the case of maps such as goldrush, gravelpit, or steel.


**Division Structure and Prize Information**

This tournament will consist of one National division. If there is enough interest in the tournament we will expand into an Advanced division for higher-skilled teams.

Teams are competing for glory, cool frags for awesome movies, and of course, all the bragging rights you can handle.


**Maplist**

The map rotation will be put to vote in a public forum, though CEVO reserves the rights to remove maps that would be considered ""trolly"", such as orange.",,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,flair-soldier,True,t3_twpaa,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/twpaa/cevo_announces_team_fortress_2_highlander_revival/,

1373659285.0,34,self.truetf2,1i6bfn,List of features a TF2 broadcast and shout-caster's tool should have,WaffleSandwhiches,39,5,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1i6bfn/list_of_features_a_tf2_broadcast_and_shoutcasters/,"So if TF2 is going to make a push to become a Class-A esport (and this is certainly looking like Valve wants to start doing with TF2), it's missing a few requirements. One of them is a robust tool-set for watching, or casting replays and live games. Dota 2 has an excellent spectator program, as does CS:GO. Starcraft 2, LoL all have fairly intuitive, and most importantly moddable spectator huds. We have a lot of good spectator options out there already, but we're missing a few key components before shout casting becomes common place. Of course, there's always STV and the demo system, but that's not good enough anymore. It's too clunky and too prone to breaking your HUD. Plus, there are a lot of neat features only Valve has the opportunity to add.

NOTE: I'm going to assume that a spectator's mode gets released with a matchmaking system.

**Access**
The public needs to have super easy access to any game they want. Right now it's really difficult for an average person to get a demo they can use. Most the time they don't know the teams, sometimes the demo is out of date with the client, and sometimes they're mislabeled. Dota 2 does this really well. Every player has a history log on their profile that's easy to access and download the replay.

*Allow servers to host a plugin allowing them to send match data to a Valve hosted Video Repository

*Start tracking the tournament_mode games people are playing on

*Allow this repository of video logs to be searchable. Looking for players, game mode, maps, weapons used, everything.

**Transparency**
Probably the biggest barrier to TF2 as a spectator sport is that positioning the camera is a very difficult task, especially for a mode as busy as highlander. This is a huge issue, if you have a vanilla tf2 installation, you can't even see everyone's health

*Create a simple spectator hud for everyone to use. We already kinda know what we want here. We want somewhere to show the status of everyone at once. Right now, we just show the class + an uber charge, but there could be so much more information.

*Create in game transparency. [Blue's spectator plugin](http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/7848-advspec) should become an in game standard to help see players that are far away from the camera, or behind cover. Toggle health bars above players will also help focus the spectator's attention into the action, keeping people from having to check the hud elements all the time.

*Have interactive features, just like in Dota 2, let spectators take control of the camera if they don't want to follow the shout-caster's perspective. Let people set camera way points to quickly jump to specific points of the action. Create a Picture-In-Picture feature to let people watch things like back caps without missing the main action. Let the status boxes showing player health be clickable, and send you right to their perspective.

That's all I can think of at the moment. Let me know about any other things",,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,,True,t3_1i6bfn,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1i6bfn/list_of_features_a_tf2_broadcast_and_shoutcasters/,

What it comes down to is this.  As long as Chess Club beat Vector Gaming (1-12) next week, they're going to LAN for sure. So this leaves the last spot up to FT or Xen.
 
 FT have 3 matches remaining against Xensity, Chess Club, and Classic Mix^.  If FT win any of those matches, they make LAN.  In order for Xensity to make LAN this season, They must beat FT tonight and hope CC can beat FT tonight as well.  Then Mix^ has to beat FT next week on Granary.  This puts FT at 8-8.  If Xen can beat Vector (1-12) they would also be 8-8 in this scenario with Xensity with the tiebreaker being most Rounds Won. Currently Xensity has 32 RF and FT has 35 RF.
 
TL:DR: There are a few more scenarios that can complicate things but it comes down to this: If Fully Torqued  win 1 match tonight, they go to LAN. If they lose both tonight, things get interesting.

1360756082.0,32,self.truetf2,18fv6z,MVM Expert: The Formula and General thoughts,lurkeroutthere,45,13,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/18fv6z/mvm_expert_the_formula_and_general_thoughts/,"Alright I apologize if this is the wrong reddit for this. Normally this subreddit seems pretty hardcore strategy and I realize MVM is kind of it's own special child. But for variosu reasons (mostly the odd hours i'm active due to my night shift schedule) I find myself playing a lot of MVM. 

Here are my observations at 36 tours in on MVM expert (plus mischelanious putzing around on maps I don't need).

Beating MVM Expert is all about sustained damage without dying. Clases that deal large amounts of damage continuosly like heavies are prefered where as classes that deal situational damage such as pyro or soldier are somewhat less then ideal. Classes that don't deal damage such as medic and spies in my opinion should not be played. As such i believe the basic MVM formula is as follows along with what they bring to the team. Engie (Line Reinforcement/Holding), Scout (Money Collection, Milk and Mark) Demo (Medic Destruction/Crowd Control), 2xHeavies(Raw Damage over time). The sixth person can be a wild card. Now you can of course deviate from this formula but the more you deviate from it the harder life is going to be. The more your deviate the better your invidiual team members need to be and the better you need to be at working together as a team. Below I'll go into the classes you should be picking for your wild card, generally in my order of prefrence.

The desired:
Heavy - As I've already said the heavy is the backbone of the MVM force. More of a good thing in this case can often become a great thing. So much so if I have a team of 6 guys i know and work well together and we just want to blast through a map to help someone finish out a tour we'll generally go three heavies. It's like easy mode for MVM most of the time.

Soldier - Soldiers with buff banner are great for serving minicrits up to the team. The bane of soldiers is the fact that most MVM maps have lots and lots of pyros (coaltown is if i recall correctly the only exception) and usually deflector heavies too. Robo pyros are really really good at reflecting rockets back into the faces of your team mates. That's why people hate on soldiers a lot.

Second Demo - Two demos can work out especially if they communicate well. Downside is demos need to do a fair amount of preping the battlefield and don't really do anything for their team mates.

The sub-optimal:

Sniper - Sniper gets a lot of hate because a lot of the people who think they can play sniper just arn't very good, just like in regular TF2. That means just like in regular TF2 most snipers are dead weight. That's not to say a properly equiped sniper or a really skilled sniper can't be a positive force, just most fo the time they are not. If you do want to be a contributing sniper there are two ways to go about it 1) Be amazing and get exploding headshot and other benefits 2) Jarate + bushwhacker, fully upgrade Jarate and max out your resistances also increase your melee attack speed. Piss on everything you can whore up every opportunity to minicrit from your team mates you can.

Pyro - There are a lot of people who really seem to like pyro in MVM. They get really really focused on the fact that a pyro can reset the bomb and get the team out of a tight spot. What they overlook entirely is if you are following the formula by and large you don't need to reset the bomb because everything is dead. In addition pyros when they do reset the bomb cause the robots to path funny, this is most apparent on mannworks. The follow on to that is robots who are pathing around because they've been reset with the bomb have time to charge up and could potentially be granting defensive buffs to all the robots around them. If a gaggle of defensevely buffed deflector heavies come around the corner your defenses likely won't stand up to it. Lastly burning robots dying in funny places is like the #1 cause of lost money. That in turn leads to the team not getting the bonus which over time can really start to stack up. 

The Non Starters/Vote Kickers: 
Medic - Poor poor medics, so valuable in regular TF2, so worthless in MVM. None of the things the medic get is all the great in MVM to make up for the fact that you've got one guy on your team who's not dealing any damage really.

Second Scout - Scout would be a unpalayable class for MVM if it wern't for their ability to get health from money and the need to have someone taht can range the field and pick up money. The mad milk slow and the fan of war mark take them from a necissary evil into a territory where they can be a real asset to a team. Plus giant robots hate getting marked and then milked more then they hate bieng damaged. A good scout with good resistances can use this to their advantage to draw fire and protect their team mates while keeping their own health filled up. All of this means that a scout can be an asset to the team without firing a single shot. Now having said that while one scout is essential two is bad. They just don't have the staying power without money to refill/overheal them and if there are two of them there is less money to go around.

Spy - I have never had a successful run with a spy that I can recall. They are all the situational problems of scouts and engies without any of the real team buffs.

Second Engie - Two engies = 2 x sentry busters the hassle involved with completely negates any positives from the class.

So thanks for reading my guide if it's useful i'll put some other MVM related stuff up.

TLDR: MVM Expert is all about damage 2 Heavies, 1 engie, 1 scout, 1 demo,1 wildcard is the path to success. Some classes are better then others.

Edit Addendum: I see a lot of people misunderstand my general aim here. I'm not saying other configurations arn't invalid, just the above formula gives you the greatest chance for success in my opinion if all other variables are taken for granted. If you are throwing yourself into the MVM que and get a pickup group these  are the roles that should get filled before you worry about mucking around with things if you want to succeed, and succeed in a timely fashion. Also i get the feeling that a few of the people think i'm talking about all MVM. On lower difficulties you can pretty much make do with whatever party you want and probably come away fine. Expert is generally a lot less forgiving.",,False,,t5_2stfn,1360852494.0,,,True,t3_18fv6z,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/18fv6z/mvm_expert_the_formula_and_general_thoughts/,

1. TALK to your team. Find out how they want to play and always consider that before making any choices.


2. Get to mids with 300. ALWAYS. 

A. Whip to middle. Players that should be whipped: Heavy, sniper, spy. Many demos do not want whips as it can mess up their jumping. Discuss with your demo. No need to whip medic or pyro. They shouldn't be doing anything on middle that requires they get there faster. The medic can keep close enough pace with the heavy without whips anyway. Heavy with GRU + whips is amazingly fast. Keep rocketjumping to keep up with him, but be sure that you wait for 300 hp from your medic before engaging on middle.

B. Don't escape plan to middle, even if you arent running whips (run the escape plan, just dont try to damage yourself dramatically to get to mid quickly). Try to have as few jumps as possible in your rollout so you can get to 300 quickly once you make it to middle.


3. You are pacman. Eat those health kits like fucking power pills. Don't take kits from your own team, but if you can get in their space and just start eating metal kits and health packs like a motherfucker, their team will be much weaker for it.


4. Watch the flank. You are not a committed pick class like sniper or spy. You are a DM powerhouse that happens to be very quick when needed. Medic picks are largely unimportant if your team has an advantage of 20% or more. Stay alive and frag power classes. The medics will follow.
* Do however take medic picks if they have advantage/both have uber. Even dying to force a useless uber is very worth it as your team can run away then re-engage with a large advantage.

5. Annoy. Get behind them, break teleporters, and spawncamp classes that cant defend themselves against you. Abuse hiding spots to get valuable picks. Spam rockets from far away to deny crit heals. Run away with the escape plan whenever you get hurt. Take imbalanced 1v1s and abuse health kits whenever possible.

6. On maps with setup time, whip your engy until he reaches his setup spot. This will give him a good 4-5 second time advantage to build up a little more.

7. Use the beggars bazooka when you need a pick. Seriously that shit is crazy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7fM07a3MGY

1359724674.0,33,self.truetf2,17oxnu,"Competitive Medic - ""Let's make MUSIC!""",Rusty_Bodega,44,11,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/17oxnu/competitive_medic_lets_make_music/,"My name is [Rusty_Bodega](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/a/ad/Scout_dominationmed03.wav), the same guy that brought you [Highlander Sniping - ""Who pissed in my Jarate?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/qlma6/highlander_sniping_who_pissed_in_my_jarate/). I'm also semi-retired (not *retarded*) from competitive gaming all together, but I enjoy playing pugs in extreme downtime every so often. 

**I've never heard of you before, are you some kind of F2P pubstar?**

I'll try to keep this introduction short. I used to (and still kind of) main Medic during my competitive days of TF2 (with an off-class of  Sniper.) I was also co-leader of the infamous, short-lasting UGC Platinum team [Schutzstaffel](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/1/16/Spy_positivevocalization05.wav). As of now the only competitive  activity I engage in is Highlander pugs on #tf2.pug.nahl, and the occasional ESEA 6's. My hobbies still include cooking and gardening, but recently I  picked up circuitry (it's pretty interesting stuff, but hard as fuck to learn in your spare time.) On top of this I've also started  reading a lot more, most currently selections from Vonnegut and Huxley. 

**Okay then, why should I listen to a retired, no-name Medic?**

Because I most likely view the role of Medic much differently than you do. It's interesting to see how others approach certain aspects of gameplay, and it might help some of you to understand your class a bit more. I have set this up similar to translated copies of ""The Art of War"" by Sun Tzu, because it makes it easier to read in short sections rather than large clumps of paragraphs. I have also chosen to compare my analogy to 6v6, primarily because I found it easier to explain (I still view the approach similar to Highlander mechanics.) 

**WITHOUT FURTHER ADO...**

Do you appreciate Symphonies?

^^**1.)** Playing Medic is like conducting a Symphony.

^^**2.)** You may be conducting 4th graders in their first recital, or possibly a bunch of professionals who have been performing for years.

* In either case, the application remains the same.

^^**3.)** Your heals represent how well you're conducting the rhythm/tempo. Your players' classes represent the types of instruments being played.

* The ***Demoman*** represents the Cello. A loud and merciless low-tone instrument, the Cello is the backbone of your Orchestra.

* The ***Pocket Soldier*** is like the Violin. This instrument has a sharp sound and hits the important high notes. It's also the instrument closest to the conductor, typically to their immediate right and left.

* The ***Roaming Soldier*** is like the Viola. This instrument can hit tones between that of a Violin and Cello. It's typically in front of the conductor, but isn't always necessary to hear due to the range it's playing at.

* The ***Scouts*** are the instruments that make your Orchestra unique. They represent your Woodwinds, Brass, and Percussions. These need to be conducted the most intensely, because their involvement with Strings is a difficult task.

^^**4.)** A fully over-healed team is when your Orchestra is at its peak performance. However, for a conductor (you and I), this typically occurs only before and after the music builds up. The bulk of your musical piece is when the battle begins.

^^**5.)** When parts of your Orchestra begin to lose rhythm, it's on you to decide who needs conducting the most. This is something that cannot be hand-fed, because every situation is different. For example:

&gt;""The entirety of my Orchestra is slightly off-tempo, but my unique instruments close by (woodwinds, brass, etc.) are playing the loudest, so they affect my audience the most. In this case, I will focus on straightening them out first while signaling my Strings to play softer. *Then* I will focus on my Strings.""

^^**6.)** The previous analogy might appear to lose its context a bit when you're dealing with physical distances between you and the classes that need healing. I'm here to tell you this is not true.

^^**7.)** If your Orchestra is not paying attention to your signaling, they cannot easily correct their rhythm/tempo [they can grab med kits, but not receive an over-heal if they are not close.] This works vice-versa if *you're* not paying attention, but they are.

**This Rusty Bodega guy is crazy...**

Might be, but there you have it. It's always fun when you learn a new perspective from someone playing your class. It sometimes becomes difficult to explain meta things within a class that need to be taught by constant playing. I skipped some analogies because this is the general train-of-thought; calling strategies and things like that would be off topic and used for its own section if I really cared about doing another one. 

**tl;dr** - Healing priorities, although known, are not quite understood. It's sometimes difficult during a fight to decide who needs healing over another class (but sometimes the choice is obvious.) Instead of looking at healing priorities in the normal sense, I share with you another perspective that is different from the norm: my own. I believe that seeing things from a completely different viewpoint can help better understand the process at hand. I'm offering you 3rd person perspective in your 1st person world.

**Note: This is also open for discussion due to my assumptions that people won't fully understand the analogies as they first read along. That, and I'm not the best Medic in the world (because who cares about doing that... I HAVE REAL WORLD GOALS, PEOPLE!)**

However, this  highlander season saw some other primary choices become popular, especially the Black Box for roamers since there are more classes to steal heals from.  So I got this idea to start experimenting with different primaries and I most recently picked up the Liberty Launcher.

Now a lot of people might scoff at the idea of using a liberty launcher in competitive play, but I think the weapon has some positive benefits that could be explored:

1. Faster rocket speed makes killing a lot of classes easier.  Scouts are very weak to this weapon, as are Pyros that rarely encounter the LL's projectile speed.
2. Bombing or at least getting rockets on a retreating Medic is arguably easier, again due to projectile speed.
3. It allows for more effective spam in the hands of a smart Soldier, since he can put rockets on a choke point to react to a pushing enemy just that much more quickly. (no enemy sticks around in a choke point for 4 rockets anyways)
4. 3 rockets is enough to kill all but 3 classes pretty much instantly in Highlander anyways.

Now I understand that using the LL means sacrificing your 4th rocket and it definitely means a big change in playstyle.  For one, it can be more difficult to get to the top of mid on a 5cp map and out-duel the other Soldier, especially if he has that 4th rocket.  However I can see the weapon being moderately effective on a small KOTH map or on a Payload defense where you're not jumping around much anyways.

As you guys probably already know, we play highlander pugs in #tf2.pug.nahl. Currently we probably have pugs running at least 12 hours everyday, but sometimes we have more than 18 people added up and then 1-10 people don't get to play. However, you can remedy this problem by joining up and playing! 

What I'm getting at here is that we already have a lot of players in #tf2.pug.nahl. There's never really been a problem with filling up pugs at night. WE JUST WANT MORE PLAYERS.

**We won't exclude people who aren't super strong at tf2, but we do require you to have a working mic, mumble installed, and a basic sense of how to play highlander.**


Join up today! We have a steam group http://steamcommunity.com/groups/tf2pugnahl, and I won't mind if you just join the group for kicks. We do post announcements on the group if we ever need players to join up, but even if you idle in the channel I still appreciate it! 


Currently, we are testing the map rotation. We have some cool custom maps like mach4 that we play from time to time. We also have rtv enabled so you can always change the map! It's awesome.


And finally, if you don't want to be confused by all that IRC jazz, use this link to connect to the webchat:
https://webchat.gamesurge.net/?channels=tf2.pug.nahl
Commands can be learnt by typing !man or visiting this link:
http://ugcleague.com/forums/showpost.php?p=95886&amp;postcount=74

But it's pretty simple. !add class1 class2 to add to the queue, !remove to remove yourself, !status to see the score of current pugs, and tada. Once 18 players are added up you're good to go. 

You can even come to #pug.nahl to spectate our pugs! It's not a bad way to get a feeling for how decent highlander games are played.

I expect some fresh new faces coming in tonight!

.

Hello truetf2!  Today's topic is simply: Do we need a better spectator system?

Currently, the best the native client gives us is the advanced option to show every health bar, class, and respawn time.  Personally, I feel like this could be revamped, along with the system for spectating entirely.

On the topic of spectator HUDs, regardless of what custom hud you load, we only get a very small amount of information as a viewer.  Things that would be interesting to see would be:

* Medic's medigun
* Classes lining up/in order
* Better warnings for combat
* System to spectate behind specific players faster, instead of cycling between all live players
* Which players are in combat actively, which aren't
* When a player switches to an offclass(6's)

These are just some ideas on what could be done to spice up the in-game hud system, but there are many more areas that could use improving.  Take for instance, the fact that our only means of watching a match are either direct spectating(usually banned to prevent ghosting), and sourceTV.  Don't get me wrong, sourceTV is an excellent system that helps a lot, but wouldn't it be great if we had a native form of STV?  Imagine the front page of TF2 showing a couple of invite-level scrims/matches that we could just join in on and spectate live, with a delay of course, and see the action straight through our own cameras?

That's it for now truetf2.  If anyone suggests anything radically different, and deserving of attention, I'll add it in this post for some spotlight.

1335913912.0,36,self.truetf2,t2ayu,[PSA] An alternative to the Replay system: automatic Demo recording in Pubs (r/tf2 crosspost),Cocktorpedo,42,6,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/t2ayu/psa_an_alternative_to_the_replay_system_automatic/,"This post is tailored towards people who mostly play on public servers.

With how buggy the replay system currently is, there's always room for alternatives. Competitive players will already be familiar with the PREC plugin, which automatically records match demos (which are often required to be recorded by league rules).

Without further ado:  
[Download PREC here, and save the files in /Steam/steamapps/accountname/team fortress 2/tf](http://orangad.com.ua/)  
To adapt the PREC plugin for pub usage:

* Set prec_mode 3, prec_delete_useless_demo 1, and prec_min_streak to number of your choice, we'll use 7 as an example. All this can be done from console.
* Bind prec_mark to a key you'll remember (I have it bound to both ] and 0 on the keypad). 
* Type prec_dir 'demos'. Now all demos recorded will save in /Steam/steamapps/accountname/team fortress 2/tf/demos

A quick rundown;

* Prec_mode 3 tells the plugin to record every game you play.
* Prec_delete_useless_demo 1 deletes every demo you record without a killstreak or a bookmark.
* Prec_min_streak 7 sets the minimum killstreak needed to save the demo to 7
* Bind prec_mark ""([Your key here](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/List_of_default_keys))""

The demo will contain the entire round (Or maybe the entire game, I honestly don't remember), and the killstreaks.txt file generated by the plugin will tell you the time and 'tick' at which you can locate when you pressed mark. You can choose to record the output via fraps, or you can choose to export it as an .avi file.

If you don't get any killstreaks in a life of 7, or if you don't press your mark key, it'll automatically delete the demo after the session. Marking the demo will save it from deletion, and give you a time in killstreaks.txt at which you marked. You can mark as many times as you like in a demo, for when you get multiple awesome moments or killstreaks. 

Advantage of this system:

* Killfeed can be enabled/disabled
* HUD can be enabled/disabled
* Minimal chance of corruption of file
* Greater editing capabilities
* Automatically saves good killstreaks
* Works on servers without replays enabled

Disadvantages:

* Can require some basic knowledge of console commands. [Recommended reading](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Demos)
* Somewhat user unfriendly UI

With these settings, you should have no problem with corrupted replays and the like, or being on non replay servers. And you can even have the HUD and killfeed enabled if you so choose!

In doing so, I noticed a very surprising trend. In maps that don't generally lend to one over the other (KOTH, etc) and favor the pyros play style, pyros that tended to pocket more used shotgun; while ""roamers"" often utilized the flare gun. Watch videos of good shotgun pyros and good flare pyros and you'll probably notice this trend as well. While obviously the Pyros did a little bit of both, the ones that liked to roam *a lot* **universally** used the flare gun. The ones that preferred to constantly spy check or be part of the pocket utilized the shotgun 78% of the time*. 

I myself love the Flare Gun. That being said, as I developed my Flare and transitioned away from shotgun I found myself roaming **a lot** more. I was wondering if other Pyros feel this way as well? When I pocket hard, I actually use shotty. I feel like if someone's bombing my medic it's much more reliable. But when roaming, I want that drop down, one hit kill the medic ability.

So rather than get into a huge pissing fight about which secondary is better, what do you guys think about this concept (especially you Pyros out there)? The two are side grades whether you admit it or not (name one other set of weapons other than kritz/medigun that are juggled back and forth so often), so perhaps play style better reflects what you're more likely to be proficient with. Thoughts?


*Really arbitrary system used to determine ""roaming"" vs ""pocket"" pyros to help me make a decision as to what qualified a pyro as either.

**Predictions**

mix &gt; iT 5-2 by highwayunicorn

ESEA TV's weekly match should be a good one, with Don't Trip basically praying for another chance to prove themselves against a top team and Classic Mixup on the hunt for vengeance after their first loss of the season. Though enigma said that the team might swap TLR and Platinum back to demo and soldier respectively, the loss to bp and the increased level of Invite competition might keep them on their Viaduct lineup. Don't Trip have had talk of flipping everything around, and have been playing with Hero on roamer and blaze on scout in an effort to shake things up. There is even some talk that Mad Chad could end up pocketing with Tyrone on roamer, though that seems a distant possibility at the moment. The role swap should be good for the team, as both players have struggled out of the gate. Ruwin and his pocket always get such good ubers that I think it will take a great performance out of Alfa and Tyrone to turn this into a DT win, and so far, they do not seem capable of that.

I've been in a situation like this a few times, and I feel like most of those times it doesn't go well for me.

He can just splash me with a few rockets from above at his leisure and since I'm not running the shotgun I'm pretty helpless.

I've been hosting North American 6v6 Newbie Mixes for the past couple weeks, and wanted to get some more people to come join us.

The purpose of the newbie mix is to introduce new players to the 6v6 competitive format.  This is a gamemode in TF2 which is the standard competitive format.  

If you wish to play, all you have to do is download mumble ([guide to mumble](http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/993-setting-up-mumble-and-connecting-to-a-server-guide)).  Join our mumble server at chi2.tragicservers.com: 64738.

We ask that you know your rollouts (medics, soldiers and demos) and granary and badlands.  That is pretty much it.  If you do not know these, please speak up in mumble (don't be shy, we're all pretty nice) and let us know, we're more than happy to teach people how to rollout.  

If you have any questions I'll try to be on this thread as much as possible and answer anything you might ask.  I'll update this post as people ask questions.

While the skill level in these were (and continue to be) extremely low, the large selection of servers offered a wide variety of maps to choose from all with low ping and lots of people playing in them. Being able to choose almost any map with 20-24 people playing and have a ping of 30 was great. 

Fast forward to the MvM update where most of the servers seem to be updated for hosting MvM.

While I understand valve needed to switch many of the servers to account for the high demand of MvM. The neglect of there official servers is showing. Now you can choose from 24/7 badwater, 24/7 dustbowl, and a couple other over played maps. The maps don't change leading to people getting +200 points, which also doesn't promote people to at least stay to finish the map.

And good luck finding anything but basic payload or A/D. While I understand these levels tend to be easier for new players there should be other maps in rotation as well.

What I would like to see is valve change up there static 24/7 servers and maybe sprinkle in some underplayed maps like steel and sawmill between the badwaters and goldrushes.

So what do you all think? Should I just ignore valve servers and play on my community favorites or could something be done to improve them? Does there even need to be valve servers?",,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,,True,t3_zw2vk,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/zw2vk/an_issue_with_valve_servers_and_map_variety/,

A sniper"". I get the impression that, while the sniper has uses, it pales in comparison to every other class and just isn't worth using. 

The sniper has no crowd control (in terms of killing power) beyond the Machina and, well...that's not saying much. I'd rather have a heavy tearing through bots or a demo pipespamming them.

Jarate is the only thing I see mentioned in the sniper's defense, but is it really worth crippling the team? Slowdown and minicrits are great, but the spy, heavy and scout all have their own ways to slow down bots. The minicrits seem to be what makes it worthwhile, but if we have a heavy or a solider in that sniper's place it seems like their DPS is going to more than make up for the lost minicrits.

&gt;The Short Version: 
&gt;Please wait a few more days, and we are pushing season start back one week to Sept 17th/Sept 19th.
&gt;
&gt;The Long Version:
&gt;UGC League has been facing a hosting company downtime lasting 7 days. Our hosting company, nexpoint.net has had a catastrophic outage, resulting in their entire operation dropping offline. The only fix they could manage was to physically move their entire server base to a new datacenter. Every dedicated server, every co-hosted server they manage is being moved to a new datacenter. The reasons for this can only be imagined, but it is perhaps the worst situation I have ever seen related to web hosting. 
&gt;
&gt;We have found a new web host, and moved all of our files and operations. But as a data driven website, we are hoping we can reclaim our current team and user data from nexpoint prior to repointing the domain to our new host location. If we are able to do that, we can return to full operation with as little consequence to players as possible. We will wait a few more days to see if that can be managed, because it is worth waiting for.
&gt;
&gt;But in the end the recovery of current data may not be possible, in that case we will be forced to use data from the end of July. A 3 week gap will result, so teams who made changes in that period may have to redo those changes. IF we do use July 2012 data, all the new teams who joined will have to be inserted, we can do that manually, though we wil have to reset those leaders passwords and they will have to rebuild their team rosters. 
&gt;
&gt;So two possible outcomes by this weekend:
&gt;1.	We return to operation with current data
&gt;2.	OR we return to operations with 3 week old data.
&gt;We should know by this weekend.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Thank you all for your patience and understanding. -Fornaught

Their sniper is really good, and if we step out to spire from middle, we can guarantee someone dying. If we circle from house, they have their demo watching it, and the ""valley"" going to the spire (under the bridge) is also watched. 

I guess pushing with uber is the only way, but then they hide indoors and wait it out, then come back out, and our stickies can only shut down one or two areas. 

We don't have a good sniper.

We generally win everytime we scrim with them, but it's still frustrating to get constantly killed and denied by a sniper.

No matter the hardware you use!,v11che,39,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/tmd23/a_guide_to_converting_your_tf2_demos_to_mp4/,"This is a guide that I found on tfwiki.net It isn't actually on the main wiki.tf page. So I thought'd i'd involve everyone. If you want feedback on a demo, doing this would be amazing because nine times out of ten, it's much easier to comment on a youtube video than run a tf2 demo.
&gt;Here's how you can create a video using max graphics settings with constant framerates even if your hardware sucks:

&gt;If you haven't already done so, you need to record a demo of the gameplay that you want to create a video from. Do this by typing ""record [demoname]"" in the console while you are playing and ""stop"" when you are done. Once you have your demo file, follow these steps:

&gt; * Load up TF2 using the settings that you want to show in the video. This includes screen resolution. If you are planning to upload to a low-quality Streaming site, I advise using 640x480 so that it will take less time to render and upload. If you're uploading an HD video to Youtube, use 1280x720.
&gt; * Open up the console and enter the following commands: ""sv_cheats 1"" and ""host_framerate 30"" (You can record at a higher framerate if you want a 60 FPS video for editing purposes, but most streaming sites like Youtube use 30 FPS.)
&gt; * Start playing the demo either via the console command ""playdemo [demoname]"" or the demo ui accessed via the command demoui or keyboard shortcut shift+f2
&gt; * When you get to the part of the demo that you want to record, type ""startmovie [videofilename] avi""
&gt; * You should get a pop-up window with a list of codecs to choose from. I recommend using the XviD codecs. If the list doesn't include the codecs you need, you may want to grab CCCP or K-Lite (pick one, you can try the other if it's not working).
&gt; * After you've begun recording the movie, allow the game to play out. The playback will be choppy and look buggy and the sound may loop or be completely muted. Don't worry, this is normal and the finished video will not look like this. Just allow the demo to play until it's gotten as far as you want to record. If you have a lower-end system or you're recording a rather lengthy video segment, this could take awhile, so you might want to find something else to do while the video renders.
&gt; * Type ""endmovie"" in the console when you are done recording.
&gt; * The resulting AVI file will not be located in your TF folder. It will be put in your ""team fortress 2"" folder with the name you required, e.g. C:/Program Files/Steam/SteamApps/bobsmith/team fortress 2/mymovie.avi
&gt; * Now you can import the AVI into Windows Movie Maker or whatever program you use if you need to do any further editing.

The file might end up being a bit large, but there ia a lot of free video software will make the file smaller.

About a week or two ago, I came to the realization that my jumps were the bottleneck of my game, so I started practicing them and doing jump maps.  Fast forward 10-15 hours of jump practice later and I'm much, much better at jumps.  I can hardly pogo or sync or skip (yet), but from what I've seen, those methods are rarely useful in game (except for crazy gunboats rollouts).  I can jump reasonably accurately, at distance and land where I want to.

So, in the context of a 6v6 roamer or a roaming HL soldier, how do I know *when* and *where* to jump?  Given that I can position myself into a place where I can make a jump on a medic, how do I decide when to make the jump?  How do I know if I should make the jump then or wait for a better position?  What should I be considering when I decide to make a bombing run on their medic?  I've been mostly waiting until the medic is distracted, so I can hopefully land my first rocket for 80+ damage, but I find that most of the time, their team is able to position themselves in between me and the medic, so that I can get 100+ damage on the medic, but not finish the fucker off.

This is just my opinion, and I mean no disrespect to 6s as a gamemode. I'd just like someone to convince me to love it.

So, I've spent a fair while (just over a year) watching comp tf2, and seen more HL than 6s. I've watched 6s games recently, and honestly, I don't really see much to interest me in them.
Maybe it's that most of 6s seems to be in execution rather than planning, compared to HL, but honestly, to me, it just seems kinda stale.

I see the same loadouts, the same rollouts, the same maps, and the same strategies used by every team every time. I know I must be missing something, so what is it?
Maybe 6s is, like, a precious gamemode or something, but what's so great about it being limited, even just in terms of weapons, to such a small array?

There's one factor I've seen from 6s that I really enjoy, and that's the close-knit, detailed teamwork that I can sometimes see come through; the kind of stuff where there is a really smart kind of plan that's really new to me, that's been carried out really well. Really.

Progress is slow, but I have not abandoned this.

**What's changed:**

* Mac users will (hopefully) now see their native file chooser.
* Rendering is faster
* Loading is faster
* Support has improved marginally for certain HUD elements (for example, the huntsman charge bar now appears correctly in the lower right of the screen).
* **Many** internal changes (that don't affect you guys :/)

**Known issues:**

* Ctrl+A does not work.
* Things get weird when elements are parented and you select both.
* Things get hairy with many elements on the screen - I recently switched over to using the layer of the element to determine selection priorities - the ones on top are picked first (was previously based on size and distance). However, elements can share the same layer..
* I have code for the native windows file chooser, but it does not display correctly quite yet, so it is disabled.
* The properties panel does not update when moving elements on the screen.

**TODO:**

* Font support
* Colour support
* Resolution changing
* Saving
* diff
* undo/redo

1368487443.0,33,self.truetf2,1ea0m8,2 cfgs I made to help with spectating STV demos,djnap,34,1,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1ea0m8/2_cfgs_i_made_to_help_with_spectating_stv_demos/,"I've been looking into casting, and realized that I couldn't find any good binds/cfg files to help avoid the problem of clicking through every player. I also realized that a lot of people want to be able to click on who they want, when they want.

As a result I wrote 2 cfg files, one for 6s and one for HL, that casters and other people can use to switch to the players they want.

Step 1, download Miek/Mike's spectator plugin. You can download that [here](http://flomp.net/spec_helper/) from Mike officially ~~[here](http://puu.sh/22PNQ) (thanks to /u/DavidTheWin for uploading his version 2 months ago, otherwise I could never find it)~~. This plugin DOES require -insecure in your launch options, but seeing as casters will be most likely using /u/sblue's plugin, this should be the case anyway.

What does this plugin do? It essentially replicates pressing 1,2,3 while spectating in the actual game server but on STVs. It inserts a new command spec_player_ex, that can be used to spectate exact players easily, without needing their name.

Step 2, check out/download the following 6s or HL specific CFG files.

[6s](http://pastebin.com/vnxBccAX)

This file, by default, makes Mouse3 a toggle between player switching buttons, and 3rd person free roam buttons. If the player switching buttons are active, Q and A switch to blu and red medic, W and S Demo, E 2 blu soldiers, D 2 red soldiers, R 2 blu scouts, and F 2 red scouts. For the ones that are bound to two players, press it a second time to get the other player. (I personally found it easier while casting, to have the same class bound to the same button, so I didn't have to figure out which scout/solly. It does, however, make it more difficult when people are off-classing.)

[HL](http://pastebin.com/kLyGgtbR)

This file, by default has the free roam buttons as WASD, up and down Q and E and all the class buttons to their class number on the numPad, 1-9 (scout 1, medic 7, sniper 8, spy 9....). Pressing those 1-9 on the numPad will switch to the blu team class. Holding shift and pressing 1-9 on the numPad will switch to the red team class. Simple, yet effective.

Step 3, the actual work (but really easy, and takes ~1 minute)

After loading either your STV demo or connecting to the STV server, wait for all 12 or 18 players to connect. Open your cfg file, and edit the number for each class. This ""number"" is the second number of spec_player_ex (the first being the team). The number corresponds to how many people from the bottom they are. The very bottom is 0, and the very top is 5 (for 6s) or 8 (for HL).

Save your CFG file.

Step 4, open console, type exec spectate6s or exec spectateHL (assuming that's what you called them) and your keys will work. Awesome!

I'm not sure what types of CFGs big time casters use, but if it's easier/more efficient I would love to hear it.",,False,,t5_2stfn,1368549236.0,,,True,t3_1ea0m8,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1ea0m8/2_cfgs_i_made_to_help_with_spectating_stv_demos/,

(mac compatible!),RaysFire,36,4,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1d8g2w/rayshud_v33_is_out_mac_compatible/,"Instead of spamming reddit with another unorganized post filled with millions of links about my HUD, I figured I'd only post what was necessary. So, as a result, if you don't use my HUD, you can either disregard this post, or check it out here: 

* http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/981-rayshud

But for those of you who do, this update is specifically important to mac users. It's come to my attention that macs render the font I used in my HUD different, so in order to alleviate that, I've created alternate font files that should work better. However, since I don't have a mac, I'm going to have to rely on you all to make sure that everything looks okay. So, if you can either drop a post in this thread or on my Steam group (which can be found [here](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rayshud)), I'd really appreciate it. 

Thank you all so much for using my HUD, I hope you guys continue to enjoy it!

Below is my post on TeamFortress.TV, with links to download the latest version and the new installer Tree made for my HUD. (Which, if you haven't checked out yet, you really should. It's super nifty, and works great.)

&gt;**Version 3.3 is out!**

&gt;It includes the following fixes:

&gt;* -Added in a heavy rage meter for MvM.
&gt;* **-Added in mac-compatible fonts.**
&gt;* -Fixed a few misaligned things.

&gt;You can get it here:

&gt;https://github.com/raysfire/rayshud/archive/b2cf416872042b8f5cde38a882356b3023941120.zip

&gt;Or via the installer by Tree:

&gt;and here's the installer if you're using Steampipe:

&gt;_____

&gt;If you're using a Mac and would like to use this hud, then upon installing, navigate to your resource folder. From there, delete both the ""Cerbetica"" and ""Cerbetica_edited"" fonts. Then, rename the ""Cerbetica-mac"" and ""Cerbetica_edited"" fonts to the names of those you just deleted, replacing them.

&gt;Plese note that I don't have a mac though, so these fonts may not be perfectly centered. If they aren't, if you could please provide a screenshot, I'll do my best to update the fonts to font as they should. Thank you.

Star names like Cookye, Ryb, and Bybben will be rolling in to town for Broder's side, while Crack Clan will feature superstar sniper TviQ as the centerpiece of a more teamwork oriented squad. Their match earlier this season ended in a one map a piece split, with Broder taking it due to the way Golden Cap rules work.

It contains:

* -Fixed a few errors being output to console upon game launch.
* -Updated default ctf hud to be less blocky.
* -Fixed potentially broken health cross for some users.
* -Removed ""On the bright side.."" message that would appear upon death.
* -Fixed crate numbers getting cut off in backpack display.
* -Updated winpanel so that it doesn't touch the bottom of the screen.
* -Fixed health sliding off the top of the TargetID at resolutions other than 1920x1080.
* -Added in an optional HL scoreboard.
* -Added in animation upon health pickup.

**HOW TO INSTALL MINMODE**

To do this, just copy all of the folders inside of the ""minmode"" folder, and paste them into your tf folder. It's essentially the same as installing the hud normally, the only extra step is making sure that the files you copy over are the ones in the ""minmode"" folder and not the root directory. 

Remember that if you're a 4x3 user to copy those files in the ""4_by_3_ratio"" folder and paste them into your tf/resource/ui folder!

It may be easier to do both of these things via the installer below.

**rayshud installer**

[rayshud installer v1.0](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/18079550/Rayshud%20Installer.zip)

The installer is still in beta, but at the current time it features the option to enable/disable the health cross, 4x3 resolution support, and auto-installation of hud crosshairs. Just know that if you don't have a 1920x1080 resolution it may not line up the crosshair perfectly, but we're working to fix this.

**HOW TO INSTALL MINMODE**

~~Until Tree updates his installer (which hopefully shouldn't be too long), the only way to install the minmode version of the hud is manually.~~

To do this, just copy all of the folders inside of the ""minmode"" folder, and paste them into your tf folder. It's essentially the same as installing the hud normally, the only extra step is making sure that the files you copy over are the ones in the ""minmode"" folder and not the root directory. 

Remember that if you're a 4x3 user to copy those files in the ""4_by_3_ratio"" folder and paste them into your tf/resource/ui folder!

**EDIT: The installer now works. You're still welcome to install it manually, but the installer may be faster.**

**rayshud installer**

[rayshud installer v1.0](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/18079550/Rayshud%20Installer.zip)

The installer is still in beta, but at the current time it features the option to enable/disable the health cross, 4x3 resolution support, and auto-installation of hud crosshairs. Just know that if you don't have a 1920x1080 resolution it may not line up the crosshair perfectly, but we're working to fix this.

But sometimes I find myself playing pocket and I'm kind of at a loss of what to do.  It's kind of a how to find that line between protecting medic but still being aggressive enough to be a force on the field.  
 

For example, in gran mid I usually go in left side and I want to be aggressive, go out mid (not on point, but more under walkway) or jump on the boxes and try and deal some damage, but at same time having to protect med I take that as priority and feel like I'm playing way too passive as pocket.  Same with badlands, if I'm pocket and get to mid through house, I usually get spammed (and die) or end up retreating into house and just kind of holding there instead of going out and dealing some boss powerhouse damage.  
 

So I guess what I'm really asking is how do I approach mid as pocket??  I understand a lot of it is very situational, but what do you look for and what's goin through you're head when you get there?

There are strong opinions on what needs to be done over on this thread from teamfortress.tv:

http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/1014-rip-tf2-invite

This forum's a bit less reactionary, so I was aiming to discuss community driven efforts for attempting to get more support from Valve and the TF team for our competitive scene. I'm not even directly talking funding at the moment, though if our scene grows larger it would be nice for Valve to assist in getting TF2 in larger LAN events (Dreamhack mainly, though some more organization at Quakecon would be awesome as well). 

My first suggestion would be a Valve sponsored tournament with different divisions (similar to open -&gt; intermediate -&gt; invite, only ideally with more divisions to allow for a more even distribution of skill) and prizes that reflect the division (not necessarily cash, for now). Starting off with it being internet only may help to eliminate some problems associated with hosting a LAN event, but with enough participation a LAN event may be a possibility. Honestly, I'd love to see Valve create a service similar to ESEA for competitive tournaments. I wouldn't mind paying a 30 dollar league-entry fee for a Valve sanctioned tournament. 

So I'm curious as to the thoughts of others. Is support from Valve something we even need to consider? Should we focus on grassroots community growth, and create leagues from there? The current ESEA model is a hindrance to growth in a lot of ways, and while UGC is a great alternative, it lacks the fiscal support that ESEA has.

Two weeks ago I was commentating one of Epsilon eSports’ games against  Team Infused. While I was thinking what to say next, I suddenly realised a problem that Epsilon seemed to have for a while: they always seem to be better in the second half of the game than in the first half. In this particular game, Infused was leading 5-1 (with a back cap as Epsilon’s round win) when  F2‘s men decided to play properly. They came back to 5-5, but ended up losing nonetheless. “If only they managed to play a good first 15 minutes”, I heard myself thinking. Straight after, I asked the Danish medic if he could give me the demos of Epsilon’s officials since the ETF2L Season 11 finals about three months ago. Today, I present you my results from analysing all 29 maps that they have played since then. Let’s find out what’s so typical about Europe’s #1 Team! (at least until the S12 finals)

**L'Etranger:**

- Wow.  As a spy that does more stabbing than shooting, this is awesome.
- L'Etranger + C&amp;amp;D = if IW and C&amp;amp;D had a baby.
- L'Etranger itself isn't that bad.  I can point-blank kill razorback snipers with 3 shots.
- L'Etranger will be my primary weapon (even though I started the thread inquiring about the Enforcer.  Again, I'm more of a stabber than shooter)
- I haven't really noticed the added cloak on-hit, but I guess I passively benefit from it.
- L'Etranger + IW + Knife is my primary loadout
- L'Etranger + IW + Spycicle is situational, when I'm on PL offense and have to go take out tele first.
- L'Etranger + DR + Knife is my primary pub loadout

**Short Circuit:**

- The faster function time and lower metal cost (if you connect) make this *much* better.
- Your Demo hates me.
- Short Circuit + Gunslinger = Cart Pushing Machine.
- In a competitive pub, Gold Rush stage 2, on RED: I had a nest with L3 Dispenser and Sentry on the ledge near the cart.  I had been pestered by  a solo demo's stickies. I zapped them all.  They came back with **TWO ubered demos** throwing stickies at the same time.  I zapped them all until both ubers faded and the sentry killed all 4 of them.  No video of it :( 
- This is a great Kritz-Demo neutralizer.  The key is to keep 200 metal and focus hard on not wasting your zaps.  If I concentrate I can zap most of his 8 kritz sticky bombs.  I haven't lived through one of these, but if I zap 5 of them, he only has 3 left to try to kill my team...all while he and his medic are taking damage.
- Kritz Soldiers are much easier to handle.  The rockets are easy to time.
- I have held the last point on Gold Rush Stage 2 with a mini and a L3 dispenser.  There is generally plenty of time to zap rockets and stickies.  
- I'm more vulnerable to snipers as I expose myself to zap.
- Great for escaping from Soldiers who catch me without help (think 5cp traveling to a pt) who would normally juggle me then kill me.  When they see the Short Circuit, the switch to Shotgun, which gives me an advantage because I have the same weapon but I'm more mobile.
- I'm sold on it.

**Dead Ringer:**

- I haven't noticed *that* much of a loss due to the nerf.
- I cannot survive a pyro focus flaming on me.  But before, a tenacious pyro would simply follow and wait it out anyway.
- I cannot body block a doorway when a heavy + medic combo pushing in.
- I cannot survive stickies + rocket while cloaked.  
- But those are rare.
- I'm OK with the nerf.

**Mini Sentry**

- The wrangled inaccuracy isn't bad.  I can still take down a heavy.
- I think it's fair that people can destroy it while it's building.  It doesn't happen often, but it happens.
- I'm OK with it.


I haven't tried all of the new weapons.  What are you thoughts?


EDIT

**Quick Fix**

- How could I forget this!!  It's AMAZING.  GREAT for getting to mid-fights.  Tag along with a Scout and try to win mid.  
- If you win mid, you'll have uber soon after.  PUSH ON!!
- Uber in to last and spread the love and still be able to cap!!

first of all excuse me just in case a similar thread already exists.

So, I think you all know the problem: Around 95% of servers you find through TF2's search function sucks. Bad mods, premium shit, forced Motds, and so on. Also I hate joining a team consisting of 50% Spies and/or Snipers and there's NEVER a Medic. I really enjoy playing Medic and I do it a lot but I also need some variety

I feel like I need something more advanced than these servers but I don't think I'm skilled/experienced enough for playing lobbies or pugs. 

I already have a few servers in my favorites list but they are always empty or full. 

Do you have any suggestions? Is there a website showing servers for advanced players, or something like this? 

I fear I'm slowly getting sick of the game if things go on like this. :(

**Predictions**

Ginyu Force &gt; Quality Control 5-2 Courtesy of Pudding Cup

Given the map is croissant I wouldn’t be surprised to see a long excruciating match with many failed pushes especially into last, but eventually Ginyu Force should take this with a convincing score. QC has a pretty strong flank in the form of mang on soldier, stevec on scout, and even TMP on pyro that will be a major deciding factor in how well they perform. If these people can make magic happen on the flank I can see QC getting a round or two or at least help staving off their own demise. The amount of experience QC has from pugging 24/7 could also give them an edge on this map. Either way it should provide for some heated back and forth. Watch out for Max to get his dome on and Dill to get his hiding heavy on. This match will also be pitting famed pyro mains Huey Lewis and TMP against each other for the title of “Best at a Class No One Cares About”.

I've not been on this reddit for a while, but I haven't seen any thread that answered my question.

I've been playing TF2 for roughly a year, and these days I'm starting to like demo very much.

However, I can't even sticky...
I have acquired a somewhat not-that-bad aim with pipe, but I'm probably the worst stickier of all Scotland.
Actually, I do more damage with pipe than stickies, and that's not what I intend to do...

So I wondered if anyone had a good tutorial on sticky only,
( Or eventually on the class, with a long part about stickies, but I should have already seen it )

Or any advice.


I hope you will be able to help me.


Even if I have read the rules, I hope I'm not breaking any.


Anyway, have a nice day !

**About:**
I made this HUD in its first form about a year ago, and released it 2 months later in february of this year. I made it to update KNHUD, which was defunct at the time. A few months after release, someone now known as Quartz came by and volunteered about 2 months of his free time to help me make the HUD close to what it is now. The name comes from the fact that the first version was KNHUD with a few weapon meters from BroeselHUD, which is where the ""b"" is from. I am keeping this HUD alive even after Chippy's release of the rebuilt KNHUD.

**Thanks:**
Thanks go to Chippy for letting me use his old KNHUD as a base for this HUD. Thanks also go to Quartz for volunteering all of that time to make the HUD what it is now. Thanks to Sinders (creator of eveHUD) and Broesel for letting me use and modify parts of their respective HUDs to make this one.",,False,,t5_2stfn,1369846278.0,,flair-sniper,True,t3_14drsn,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/14drsn/kbnhud_the_remake_of_old_knhud/,

http://live.ugcleague.com/

What's UGC Live? It's a community casting portal designed to aggregate and popularize match casting of UGC games. We believe TF2 spectating has great and largely unrealized potential, and together with the community we're hoping that the central portal UGC Live provides will help bring folks together to enjoy and talk about matches.

Each week we'll be requesting SourceTV demos on our forums for community casters to cast. For everyone on the approved community casters list, whether you're youtube or twitch, all you have to do is cast. The site will automatically populate with content. If you're a twitch live caster, the site will automatically change when you go live to show your casting at the top of the page.*

What can you, as a community member, do?

* Submit STV demos! We'll have a spot on the UGC forums for you to upload your team's match demos for others to pick up and cast.
* Cast! We're hoping that UGC Live will spur folks who want to cast and never have into doing so for the first time. We'll be putting out a public call for casters who want to partner with UGC Live.
* Comment! UGC Live is now.. um.. live.. in beta form. We're hoping the site will change and adjust as we receive community feedback. That's why I'm posting this here. We want to promote an intelligent, constructive conversation about how UGC Live develops. I'll be monitoring this thread, or you can comment about it on the UGC forums here: http://ugcleague.com/forum/showthread.php?t=514 Redrum and I have been working on this the past few months, delayed by the host change, and we'd both love to get your input.

Thanks guys.

-Aubron

*This doesn't mean you can't cast non-UGC content. Both youtube and twitch will be checked for ""UGC"" in the title before hitting the site.

EDIT: Just to give you an idea of what the site looks like in ""Live Mode"", here's a photo. Note this is from the comp, not the actual site (note the placeholders and DotA stream), but this should give you a good idea. http://i.imgur.com/VAM5M.jpg

Scouts won't have a problem to get into a range where the lack of a hitscan weapon doesn't matter, or outrun attackers while shooting them - without the annoying bullet spread and less range fall-off.

 * If everyone uses an item that brings you back to life at 20% uber, then essentially that becomes the new uber floor.

 * Because of meta-shift, everyone has this weapon equipped and the bonus that comes with it, the playing field is level again and nobody is at an advantage.

 * If you wanted to use the entertaining and exciting weapon you would be at a disadvantage, due to the Vitasaw being the norm.

&gt;~~*Pshhh* disregard objective; acquire headshots~~ BAD SNIPER MENTALITY. *BAD*

Well here's a list of things anyone should do to help your team out, help you get more points, and make your team win. Some are obvious, some are overlooked things. Like half are engie tips.


---------------------------------------------------------------
**Early Game**

* Instead of teabagging your teammates, switch to engie. Most engies put their teleporters on the ground before leaving the spawn. Whack their teleporter up to level 2, switch classes, and THEN continue ~~teabagging~~ playing
* Do NOT set up your sentry at your spawn unless you're sure another engie will be getting their teleporter up.
* For offense, switch to medic and try and overheal everyone on your team. Once you're done, switch back to your main class. You'll have an extra two points, and a stronger push.
* Offensive engies should focus on getting a teleporter up. Its the best way an offensive engie can help his or her team. Sentries and dispensers have equal priority. If your team is pushing, dispensers may be useful, when the team retreats again.

---------------------------------------------------------------
**Mid Game**

* If your engies are having trouble, fall back and help them keep their nests up. Demomen, pyros, scouts, soldiers, and heavies all have some ability to help an engie defend. 
* Stop molesting your dispenser and help a fellow engie out! Splash damage can quickly ruin a nest, and engies may not be able to repair as fast as the enemies damage output. Whack their buildings, but don't leave an engie without any metal. You can build your sentry again. You can't re-build your teammates sentry for them.
* Help defend the medic at **all costs**. Take out spies, scouts, and snipers; the classes who focus on taking out medics. 
* Pyro's should airblast enemies away from medics and extinguish them. Friendly explosions around medics can force enemies to stay at certain distances from them.
* Other classes should do anything to keep the medic safe. If a heavy med combo is pushing, either extinguish the medic with Jarate, Mad Milk, or Airblast, or throw jarate, mad milk or light however they're attacking on fire. Mad Milking an enemy can help reduce pressure on medics.
* Take out your quick-fix if you have one and quickly heal teammates coming back for health. Sometimes, friendly players really want to get a full bar of health before going back into the fight. Heal your retreating team quickly, switch back to your previous class, and continue to push. 
* Killing enemy medics can help change the tide of the game. Do what you can to take them out without taking too much damage.
* Don't play as a spy unless absolutely necessary. Don't do it. If you're a very good spy player, you shouldn't have much trouble racking up 20 back stabs in under 2 minutes. Or even taking out a sentry nest for your team in under 10 seconds. If you can't do that, don't be spy.
* Rocket/Grenade spam is FTW. It can hold back enemies and may even land you a kill. Don't overdo it or enemies will obliterate you while you reload.
* Mid-game focuses a lot on taking out sentries and breaking up pushes. Do everything you can to make the game end quicker. You won't have much of a chance later on.
* Make sure you focus on the objective, not just killing the enemy.
* Know when to retreat and when to push. Retreating will keep your team alive and making a coordinated push can be a game changer. Same applies to ubers. If an enemy is about to cap, uber and stand on the point. It will buy your team a good 8 seconds.
* Dispensers are key to maintaining a living, healthy team.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
**Near End Game**

* Do whatever you can to accomplish the objective. If there's about a minute left, that gives you the opportunity to build up an uber and make one final push. You also can go demo, take out enemy defenses and push yourself. 
* If your team is absolutely screwed, tell your team to let themselves be pushed back. This can give you the opportunity to spy-cap with or without the help of your team spies.
* When on the verge of winning, spawn kill as much as possible. Its easy, and will let your team take out the pro players without distractions.
* At the point where your entire team is spawn killing and you're on defense, rush back to the objective. More often than not, there may be a back capper or spy cap waiting to happen.
* Engies should not move their sentries all the way up on defense. When your team pushes forward, move up your sentries to different areas that your team can use as a ""check point"" to continue pushing. Try not to have your sentry blown up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
**End Game**

* Teabag the noobs. 
* Honor the fallen.

**Predictions**

check &lt; mix 3-5 by dearjohncarter

This might be the hardest match of the week to predict. Mixup will be rolling out a brand spankin' new lineup: Ruwin on scout, Harbleu moving to medic, and Enigma taking over roamer. That is a scary lineup to face just because of the sheer pressure you will be under - Harbleu calls such an aggressive game, and he will have two of the best aggro scouts in TF2 history backing up his calls. A team that was already pushing out more pressure than most teams is now going to effectively double it. Chess Club do have the pieces in place to counter it, including a solid pocket who can defend his medic pretty well from the hordes in tri, and a demoman who can push enough damage through chokes to keep Mixup back in alfa. It still should go Mixup's way, but with the shakiness of the roster switch and the good play of CC lately, expect it to be a good one.

Generally this role is reserved for ~~Shrugger~~ Boston Basher Scouts, but I think there are a few advantages to giving this role to the pyro.

Pros:

1. **Allows the scout to roam.** The scout has greater survivability as a roaming class and can do greater burst damage than a pyro. He can suicide for key picks and get back to the front lines quicker than the pyro.

2. **Keeps the pyro with the combo.** With a few exceptions, this is generally where you want the pyro anyway. It helps deny bombers and spycheck. Generally a pyro is better at protecting the combo than a scout.

Cons:

1. **Distracts the pyro.** When a pyro is building, he isn't spychecking, and it will take a moment to get in position to do something useful defensively.

2. **Forces the pyro to use the detonator.** Generally the flare gun is considered to be better due the full crits rather than the mini-crits.

*****
##Introduction

Welcome back children.  We all know me, I all know you.  Please understand that this guide is written to give a quick explanation on items in the TF2 compy scene and why we see them so often.  I'm not saying that other things aren't viable, but that there is a solid reason that we see what we see so often.  Also to note, people like THIEF that use very unusual weapons like the FAN and Scottish Resistance can exist in this universe, but I can honestly say time spent learning weaponry should best be kept to using what we know work best for each class already.
*****
##Analyzing A Weapon

Compared to stock, many weapons follow a very specific trend, where they pick one of the following two options below:

**+**General Usability and **-**Situational Usability

OR

**-**General Usability and **+**Situational Usability

Following the above 2-option chart, anything that fits the first category will more often than not be loved in a competitive scene.  Adding general usability to a weapon makes your class more versatile, and offers for more advantages in a wider array of situations.  Conversely, giving up your general usability for situational features(usually gimmicks), can lead to a lower presence in many situations.  Do note, most weapons that follow the second pattern offer a specific niche, and allow you to try and overcome the General Usability disadvantage that it offers, but more often than not it is incredibly difficult to balance out the **-** it offers.  
*****
##Examples of Analysis

Time to pick some random weapons, via randoming on the wiki page until I get weapons, so without any sort of actual picking, here are the first 3 weapons randomized in:

##Force-A-Nature

**-**General combat effectiveness, via reduced clip size and **+**Situational positioning with FaN Jumping, also repositioning of enemies via close-range blasts.

Removing the general combat effectiveness of a scout by reducing his clip size so drastically really shows, and this weapon is truly a hard niche to use.  I'm really angry that the first weapon I randomed into was the FaN, because I know a lot of people like THIEF and what he does with this weapon.  However, I stand sternly in saying that a scout of equal skill using the scattergun will almost always come out on top over a FaN scout, and will generally be more useful for a competitive game.

##Direct Hit

**-**General combat power, via splash reduction and **+**Single target damage along with higher jumper denial via minicrits, also reduces rockets required to down L3 sentries from 3-&gt;2.

Hitting the soldier right in the explosions hurts.  Having such a ridiculous explosion reduction makes a soldier's rockets a liability in many scenarios, where a potential victim can actual jump over a ground-exploding rocket, and completely nullify all damage.  Sure, this downside can be mostly overcome with a large amount of practice, but in the end, it is hard to justify losing such a massive amount of combat presence for the situational offerings it brings to the table.

##Neon Annihilator

This one brings a better challenge to analysis, so it shall be done from two perspectives: engie buddy pyro, and combat pyro.

Combat Pyro:

**-**General Combat strength, via giving up a more formidable choice, a la axtinguisher and **+**Situational crits on wet targets both underwater and milked/jarated.

Engie Buddy Pyro:

**+**General engie defense, sappers are no match for your awesome sign and **-**Situational burst damage, again via axtinguisher.

Here we have a stark contrast based on playstyle.  When in the thick of combat as a pyro, nothing can match the axtinguisher, and everything else loses out in a massive general use award, until the pyro gets a sniper rifle melee option.  When defending an engineer's nest, the Neon Annihilator brings the beautiful ability to defend that nest much harder, even if your engie dies and his buildings are sapped.  Also, when defending a nest, you are not as required to deal massive heaps of damage, so much as provide airblasts for ubers, spies, and spam, and can leave the damaging part to both the sentry gun, and other players in the area.
*****
##Requests

If anyone would like a weapon of their choice to be analyzed from my own perspective, feel free to request so in the comments, and I'll see if I can't do a short writeup on it.

**edit:** All additional requests will be done in replies, this post is getting out of control.

I know a lot of you guys are excited about the UGC Highlander season, but I want to set a few ground rules as far as UGC posts go.  Remember that this subreddit is supposed to be for discussion of gameplay, not somewhere to post gossip or make accusatory statements against other players/teams.

These types of posts will be instantly deleted from the subreddit:

 - **""Gossip"" or otherwise useless talk about UGC teams or players** (*that's what the General Discussion section of the UGC forums is for*)
 - **Threads accusing other individuals/teams of using enhancements or hacks, or just generally trying to put another UGC team down** (*we take these very seriously, so please have your team leader bring these accusations and any evidence to a league admin.  Accusations should never be public*)
 - **Questions about how the rules work or how to set up a server for match nights** (*I'd rather you personally bothered me in Steam than get the wrong information here*)
 - **Looking for scrims posts** (*We have a subforum just for setting up scrims*)
 - **Discussion of UGC weapon bans** (*These generally turn into derailed flame wars, and we've heard pretty much every argument for and against every weapon we ban.  Bring your concerns to the UGC forums instead of here*)

That being said, I don't want you guys to shy away from UGC discussion at all - in fact, I more than encourage it.  Pretty much any other discussion topic pertaining to UGC is allowed, including:

 - **Promotion of casted UGC Highlander matches and other HL material**
 - **Questions about map or class strategies**

Pretty much, use your common sense and if you think a post would be more appropriate for the UGC crowd than a more generalized crowd then post it over in the UGC forums.

How does the community feel about the Cow Mangler 5000?  Personally I find the miniscule damage reduction + reload times to be very close with giving a fifth rocket, along with having much harder to see projectiles.  Bear in mind the charge shot is no where near worth using, unless vs a sentry encampment to help the team out.

Relevant Stats:Base|CM5k

* Base Damage:90|81
* Max Damage: 112|101
* Reload(First): .92|1.3 (around 50% increase)
* Reload(Consecutive): .8|.85

I wouldn't even regard the charge shot in stats comparison because of the niche purposes to it.  Only other point worth noting is unable to krit boost, which isn't too big of a deal in HL where it is allowed.  The other(much more massive and annoying) is the bug that all reflect shots will krit, thus proving that it can be krit boosted, and is buggy :(.

I have also seen when two snipers are in a sniper battle, a sniper will jump AND sometimes switch to their kukri before scoping and shooting again.


I was just curious about why they do this...it may be a simple answer, or a complex one, but it'd be fun to know.

The mere change of shoot being on release rather than on click takes some getting used to. You have no reserve ammo in your rocket launcher ""clip"", instead you hold down fire and put in a rocket at a time. Loading rockets doesn't slow you down thankfully. With this weapon you turn into a spike damage machine (if everything goes at least somewhat right) but you'll have even more difficulty with scouts, or really anything that catches you unaware as you will first have to load a rocket.

The rockets shoot out one after another in rapid succession, the spread is not barely noticable at medium to close range, but prepare to be useless at extremely long ranges and if you move your mouse to quick your second/third rocket may go even more off course. You also can't ""triple rocket jump"" unfortunately.

When I used to it I was often charging up several rockets before I saw even the hint of enemies. It's better to be safe than sorry when using this weapon. However you'll always want to fire when you reach 3 rockets or else you will die from the back fire which does around 190 damage.

Ammo consumption is pretty big if you are shooting 3 rockets in order to stop yourself from exploding so always keep picking up ammo from dead enemies and such.

So far in my extremely limited time playing, I've found it be a pleasant change of pace rocket launcher.

However, has the strategy of the format matured. I can't find the comment, but one of the members of UGC's winning teams said they won mostly by out DM'ing their opponents. As it is, most of HM meta-game has been mimicked from 6v6 (Uber-advantage, getting picks before pushes, terrain advantage.

I don't play much highlander, but I do know there is some unique strategy to it. The medic pockets the Heavy, mostly because of the great protection he can offer in addition to the fact that hes now a 450 hp wall of DPS. The pyro becomes a medic buddy, because he has the ability to counter spies almost completely and keep threats at bay with air blast. On PL maps the scout and engi keep on the cart for the 3x push cap. Still, what are other classes doing? I can't imagine a demo operating as effectively without consistent healing and support. What is the engineer doing? Are teleporters reserved for the less mobile classes? Should they use mini-sentries to apply pressure on the front lines or try to use standard sentries to ""hold down the fort"" so to speak. Are the classes that besides the combo that normally stick together? Also the issue of pushes come to mind.

I was going to organise a league, but I quite like this idea, because it is less strict.


The basic format is:

* We start with 1 team, or a few in a random order.
* To move up a rank you have to challenge and beat the team directly above you.
* You must defend from the teams below you, and have a week from when they request a match, to organise it. Failure to play in that time will result in you being dropped to the bottom of the ladder.

Additional:

* You are allowed 1 change in your team roster, after registration.
* A new team can register at anytime.


We have no sponsors, so it is more just to spur competition and games, I was wondering, cuz I love and know there is a a lot of knowledge in this subreddit, what you guys think of this format?

We will use ETF2L class restrictions.


I have played a lot of TF2, but I am almost single-handedly trying to rebuild our community, which was once flourishing, and this is my first competition/league that I am organising. We have competitive servers, and I have lots of experience regarding them, but is there anything else I need to know regarding organising a tournament/league ?

**It's like a more extreme version of the Kritzkreig:**

*  Even FASTER Uber Build
*  Even Higher Risk
*  Much Higher Reward for Medic Healing (passive dmg-type healing and resistance)

But, as pointed out many times here, it requires an aggressive team, and very nice enemy prediction. One mistake and you end up giving fire resistance to a Soldier that needed bullet resistance.


**So where will it go from here?**

I don't know enough about UGC 6v6/9v9 weapon bans. Will it be allowed next season if it has no gamebreaking bugs?

After a while, this medi-gun will end up sitting in a corner, unused for it's lack of reliability and high skill floor. Sound familiar, Spy mains?

The Vaccinator is the Medic's version of the Kunai. Not necessarily bad, but not reliable enough.

People will argue it's UP. But it's never going to get a buff because people will argue that it is balanced. The community is evenly split.

Eventually people stop caring as newer medi-guns are released.

I've come back from several weeks away from tf2 to find that my life is being ruined by spies with DR and RTR.

My typical response to a spy sapping my stuff has always been to take out the spy first and repair only once he's dead (or has at least run away). The RTR seems to completely screw with this tactic, as you must essentially decide whether to deal with the spy or try to save your buddings from being downgraded, because if left alone it takes literally seconds to downgrade your buildings (the wiki says 1.7 per level). Even if you ignore the spy entirely it seems as though you're pretty much guaranteed to lose a level on one or two of your buildings.

It's really frustrating as it seems to require so little effort on the spy's part. In addition, it encourages a kamikaze play-style: even if the spy dies relatively quickly he can cost you 400-800 metal at a time.

But why I found it interesting is pretty simple.

The -10% damage isn't noticeable that much, you still kill most classes in about 3 hits, so it doesn't matter. The no random critical hits you wouldn't even notice if you play on Competitive normally. The only thing you can notice is the slow reload speed. The other main thing you notice is the 20% damage to buildings, but most of the time those are taken care of by a demo, I'm not saying soldiers don't, but the demo takes care of it faster and more smoothly than the soldier.

The upsides are nice, 5 rockets instead of 4, most of the rocket launchers because they only have 3 rockets, and why not add another? The charge shot I don't normally use, but I find it being able to take down a building that a demo can't take down by simply disabling it, and letting your team take care of it. One final thing I notice, pyros seem to be able less able to reflect the beams that come out of them, as they are a bit less visible, and the sound it makes is less, well, loud, than the stock launcher. People also don't typically expect the splash damage it takes, so they typically stay within distance for it.

**What is it**

We get 12 people in a mumble server, divide them into teams, choose a map and play a 6v6 game. The normal maps that we play are:

Badlands

Granary

Gullywash

Snakewater

You will need to join the [Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/6v6newmix) so that you know when mixes will happpen.

**Who can play**

This is primarily open for people who are new to competitive TF2, however, div 5 and 6 people are allowed as long as anyone who is div 5 or higher offclasses.

It doesn't matter if you do not know how the roll-out goes, or the finer points of the map although it would be preferable if you had a look before you entered a mix.

**What do you need to know/need**

* Preferably the roll-out (necessary for the demo)
* An idea of what to do as your class
* The basic holds on each map
* A mic and mumble downloaded

**The rules**

* Need a microphone
* Connect to the correct mumble channel
* Need to be a conversationally fluent English speaker
* Mumble name MUST match your in-game steam name (prevent confusion)
* ETF2L season 13 config, whitelist and rules only (server-side)
* Matches last maximum 30 minutes
* Team classes limited to the following: Medic (1), Demoman (1), Soldier (2), Scout (2)

**How it works**

An admin will post up an event on the group for when a mix is going to start (15 mins notice at the least) and what slots are available for people to play. People should use comments to determine which class they wish to play. if you comment early you are likely to get a spot as your desired class however if you are late arriving for the mix your place may get taken. We apologise in advance for this. Just turn up 5 minutes beforehand! the teams will be sorted and game information handed out and you're good to go!

I'm having some problems with the Spy weapons and sets. I use the Genuine Sharp Dresser, the Revolver, and the Dead Ringer. I could use some general pointers, but I can't get over the mechanics of the Spy's dagger.

I know that I'm not supposed to wait for the Knife to go up, so that I can stab faster than waiting for it to go up, but I find that sometimes the stabs don't work, and I end up getting mowed down by alerted Heavies. 

As with the Revolver, I find that I'm only using it to pick off enemies with low health, if they have a significant amount of health, I would just go and try to backstab them, trying to get lucky.

Also, I immediately cloak as a Pyro(most of the time) as soon as I spawn, and head towards the enemy, then wait for some damage before pulling out my Dead Ringer. I tend to be somewhat successful with this method, but I'm wondering if I could do better.

Finally, my play-style is that of a support Spy/suicidal Spy. I would rush into the enemies base(like in 2Fort, but I rarely play there anymore), and attempt to sap their sentries and backstab their Heavies even if people are around. In a 1 on 1 situation, I can, if the Engie is about average, take down a sentry nest, but if there are more people, I would probably die. I'm looking to try and help my team out a lot, but not die so much.

Oh, and maybe ideas on better ways to use my equipment and stuff would be nice. I'm not willing to part with my Sharp Dresser, however, because I have the Genuine Dashin' Hashashin and the Genuine Sharp Dresser set.

1336000497.0,25,self.truetf2,t44os,Thoughts about Bazaar Bargain and other Sniper unlocks,Xovaan,35,10,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/t44os/thoughts_about_bazaar_bargain_and_other_sniper/,"I feel that the Bazaar Bargain isn't very good.

http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/File:Bazaar_Bargin_Time_Chart.png

Back when I was playing over the summer, over 5000 kills on HLtracker, my average accuracy as sniper was 80% and my average headshot accuracy was 80%. This means that 4 out of 5 shots would yield a hit and 4 of those 5 would be headshots. This means that I have a 64% chance to bring the Bargain to approximately stock sniper rifle charge speed a 41% chance to utilize a charged followup shot. This is with extreme accuracy, as in, rarely missing. When you figure 50% of an average sniper's shots hit and probably 30% of those are headshots, it gets worse. With simple math, average players have a 15% chance to bring it to stock level of charge and just barely 2% of a chance to have any perceivable benefit from this rifle. This is all just rough math, but you get the idea.

The Bargain is a very clear downgrade to any other rifle. We all know that. I understand that Valve was attempting to create a rifle that rewarded good playing with something that wouldn't replace the stock sniper rifle, but honestly I feel that it's severely lacking in this regard. And considering we already have three sniper rifles (Machina, Sleeper, and stock rifle) that reward charged bodyshots with really no downsides, I feel something needs to be addressed that reflects the sniper's linear skill progression and also rewards good playing and still not be a complete upgrade or downgrade to the stock sniper rifle.



So my solution? Make a rifle that rewards skill and isn't completely terrible for your average sniper.

The Bazaar Bargain had a great start with this: headshots, something requiring a level of skill, was rewarded with more damage on followup shots, but it unfortunately was clear statistical downgrade over any other unlock the sniper has (with the exception of the Huntsman, being that the Bargain still is hitscan and does 150 damage on a headshot, etc). 


I'd really like to see a weapon that hasn't been done before: everything has a positive charge bar. Why not make something that starts fully charged and drains to zero?

--Starts fully charged for 165 damage headshots but slowly goes to 0% for a small base damage.
--Does very low damage/no damage on body shots while scoped and cannot shoot unzoomed
--Zooms / cycles shots faster, like the speed of the weapon switch on the Degreaser

The play style would reward snipers who like faster, non-charged shots, but still keep it about as balanced as any of the other sniper rifles.

My theory:

1. You still kill light classes in one shot, mid-classes in two shots, and heavies in two or three shots
2. It rewards skill in the same way the stock sniper rifle does: linearly, and rewards accuracy with a tradeoff in line with what every other rifle currently has (powerful charged shots)
3. You trade off the ability to deal large damage with a power shot for the ability to deal more frequent smaller amounts of damage
4. We already have three sniper rifles that reward body shots (stock / machina / sleeper) and a bow that, while a great alternative play style, is still based on luck

Thoughts? This is all just a very rough idea. At its core, I like the idea of having an item that has a reverse charge bar because it hasn't been done before.

If you don't have your own Medic config yet, might I suggest getting one; they can be very handy. ""Where do I get one"", you ask? Well, look no further! As an avid Medic myself, I have compiled and tested a script I think you'll enjoy. Paste this into your ""medic.cfg"" file located in your tf/cfg folder:
    
    exec clear
    
    slot2
    heal1
    
    bind MOUSE1 ""+attack""
    bind MOUSE2 ""+popuber""

    alias medigun ""slot2;heal1""
    alias syringe ""slot1;heal2""
    alias melee ""slot3;heal2""
    
    //The bound keys here may be changed to suit your setup
    bind 2 ""medigun""
    bind 1 ""syringe""
    bind 3 ""melee""

    //autopop (added dropitem based on WatDaFok's suggestion)
    alias +popuber ""slot2;+attack2;heal1;dropitem""
    alias -popuber ""-attack2""

    //autoheal
    alias ""heal1"" ""+attack; bind MOUSE1 +switch""
    alias ""heal2"" ""-attack; bind MOUSE1 +attack""

    alias +switch ""-attack""
    alias -switch ""+attack""

**How to use:** When the Medi Gun is selected, the attack function is inverted, meaning it will constantly attack when MOUSE1 is neutral and stop attacking when MOUSE1 is pressed down. This means you can switch heal targets simply by hovering your cross-hair over them and clicking once. This function is disabled when you switch to the primary or melee slots. As for the auto-popping, MOUSE2 not only pops uber, but automatically switches to your Medi Gun if you happen to have a different weapon out. Great for tight situations.

**Why should I use this over the built-in autoheal advanced option?**
Because it's crawling with bugs. This gives you a reliable result every time and you don't have to click as much.

**---IMPORTANT NOTE:---** This script does not work well with the ""last weapon"" key, so if you use that often you may encounter some bugs.

**---ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE:---** The reason for the ""exec clear"" on the top is to reset all your binds when you switch classes so you don't run into problems. What you need to do is make a file named ""clear.cfg"" (in notepad or any other text editor) and stick it with all your other configs. This is important if you want to have class specific configs like this, but requires you to place ""exec clear"" on the top of every class config. For starters, you can enter into clear.cfg something as simple as this:

    bind MOUSE1 +attack
    bind MOUSE2 +attack2
    bind 1 slot1
    bind 2 slot2
    bind 3 slot3
    -attack

You may need to add more depending on what other configs you have installed, but this should work for the majority. Let me know if you're having any problems and I'll try to fix them for you.

mix &lt; bp 1-2 by dearjohncarter

Oh deary lord oh me oh my I can feel myself gettin' the vapors and ooh my chest is all tight and such. bp have been unquestionably the best team so far and Mixup are duking it out with Torqued for second place. Mixup should have Ruwin back, and it will be a big help for them to finally have their full six together. I am interesting to see what kind of strats b4nny comes up with for this map, as in LG form, the team never seemed to have too much cohesion on Gravelpit and it boiled down to ""can clockwork and b4nny do everything for us?""

Short introduction today. I'm a little late with this challenge.  
Anyways, good evening ladies and gentleman! Today, we have a Soldier item for you to use. I barely see this weapon in game even tho by my opinion it's viable secondary. I seriously don't understand why it's never used more often. It also have one of the best designs I know.  
  
Ladies and Gentlemen. I present to you the:  
  
##RIGHTEOUS BISON  
(somewhat clever joke about the weapon)  
Lets dive in and see what this little baby can do!  
  
* Does not require ammo  
* Projectiles penetrate enemy targets, able to hit the target more than twice when going through it  
* Projectiles can not be reflected  
* Deals only 20% damage against buildings  
  
This weapon is a pretty handy secondary weapon for spamming. At longer ranges or tight corridors, you can efficiently save your rocket launcher ammo and still do good amount of damage. Just don't try to rely on this weapon in close ranges like you do with the Shotgun. The projectiles are slow and you only have 4 shots before you have to reload. But, if you use this weapon correctly, you'll pretty much always have ammo in your primary. Remember tho, it doesn't penetrate buildings! As and extra, you can also light Huntsman arrows on fire.  
  
**Rules**  
  
* You have to play Soldier for at least 1 hour  
* You can't change class in the middle of the challenge  
* You have to use this weapon  
* You have to play REAL Soldier!  
  
That's all I have to say. It ain't much, but it will have to do. As a extra motivator, this gun even VAPORIZES targets when they die. If that's not cool, I don't know what it is.

Today, as you might can guess just by the first sentence, the challenge is from one of the Spy's wide arsenal of weapons.  
Now, before I reveal the weapon, lets talk a little about the Spy.  
  
Being one of the two classes in game that can instantly kill any non-invulnerable target (or have massive damage reduced) makes the Spy a feared enemy. Unlike the Sniper however, who is the other instant kill class, the Spy rather take care of targets up-close and personal. With the use of a knife you can backstab people to instantly kill them and together with your different kinds of invisibility watches and disguise kit, you can sneak past the enemy line and pretend to be one of them. You also have two kinds of Sappers that can disable and hurt a building in their own different ways. Together with all that, you have a big selection of revolvers, all very different and have their uses.  
Today, we are actually going to talk about the latest revolver the Spy received. A bit different with a interesting mechanic.  
  
Ladies and douchebags, I present to you:  
  
##DIAMONDBACK  
To be honest, there's not a single diamond on it's back, so you kinda got shafted on that part.  
It doesn't shoot diamonds either, it isn't listed in the following stats:  
  
* Grants a guaranteed Critical Hit when destroying a building with your Sapper. You can store up to 35 Crits and you don't need to get the credit for destroying the building, the Sapper only needs to be attached to it when it's destroyed. Lose stored Critical Hits on death.  
* -15% Damage  
* No random Critical Hits  
   
So basically, this gun rewards you for doing what a Spy should do. Making the life of a Engineer hell. Sap his buildings, get crits and blast them away on anyone who dares even looking at you. Unlike the Ambassador, this gun doesn't need to wait for cool-down and doesn't have reduced fire-rate, so you can really lay down huge damage quickly with this when you have a couple of crits stored. But, well, unlike the Ambassador, you need to destroy buildings to get those crits while Ambassador only needs to do a headshot. So, while in theory you can quickly do more damage in bursts than the Ambassador, getting those crits is usually harder and requires a lot of work.  
Now, while theory is never the same in practice, I still want you guys to take this challenge. As a bonus, tell me what the maximum amount of crits you where able to store.

**Rules**  
  
* You have to play Spy for at least 1 hour  
* You can't change class in the middle of the challenge  
* You have to use this weapon  
* I'm not restricting you guys this time in what other weapons you are allowed to use. I would recommend using the normal Sapper, but you are free to choose whatever Watch, Knife and Sapper you want.
  
I want you to make Engineers regret every building their buildings when you are around. Now get going Ladies and Gentlemen. Buildings don't sap them self.

I also push forward with the Medic as well, to keep spy checking around him/her, putting him/her out if they're on fire, and taking care of other pyros with my trusty shotgun since the Flare is hard to use on Pyros unless you're extremely close (To get a crit flare), but the thing is when I get back to the Engineer list, they're most times than not sapped and dead, yet it's dreadfully boring when I'm there defending it while no one attacks it until I leave the nest. Should I stay with the Engineer the entire game? Should I just stick with the Medic most of the time, or the Engie? I'm pretty decent at reflecting spam. For instance, my proudest achievement, was completely shutting down a kritzed demoman by reflecting all of his stuff while we retreated. I can reflect stickies mid air if I can predict he's about to do it, same for pipes (Although they're significantly more difficult), rockets are the easiest, but sometimes I'm a bit early when I'm backing away from a rocket, I end up missing for some reason. Also, I find myself getting killed by sentries because I try to go for the reflect on their missle. 9/10 times I reflect it, but 9/10 of those 9/10 times it hits nothing, thus wasting my health. And when it does hit it doesn't do enough to make a huge difference. One proud moment I had was when I blindly reflected it into the Engineer who was trying to repair it. Also, when it comes to Liberty Launcher and Direct Hit, I mostly get hit in the face trying to reflect it. If I can predict it I can hit it, but not unless I reflect as soon as he fires. 


So, basically...

Sentry Rockets -&gt; 9/10 reflecting it, 9/10 chance of missing that reflect

Rocket Launcher/Original -&gt; 9/10 reflecting it, 7/10 hitting something with it

Liberty Launcher -&gt; 5/10 reflecting, 7/10 hitting something with it

Direct Hit -&gt; 3/10 reflecting, 3/10 hitting something with it

Grenade Launcher -&gt; 5/10 reflecting, 3/10 hitting something with it directly, 7/10 getting rollers

Stickies -&gt; 5/10 reflecting


Should I work on my reflecting a bit?


Also, advice on secondary. With flare I'm too inconsistent, and I find it not as good against Pyros unless you're really good. Detonater is good for increased mobility, but I'm trying to be more defensive. Although I've seen TMP use it on cp_steel pretty efficiently.

There's been **HUGE** interest in this subreddit about competitive play recently, which I absolutely love.  I like that you all are getting interested and excited about playing in a quickly-growing style of competitive TF2.  I enjoy both helping you all out and seeing you on the battlefield, and I recognize many of your names from games I've played with you.

So with the UGC HL season fast-approaching, I'm sure you have questions about your class or the maps you're playing on.  Do you find yourself in situations that you struggle in?  Need some ideas for map strats?  Are you a team leader that doesn't know where to start when it comes to practicing?  Anything Highlander-related is valid here, whether it's vague or specific.

If your question raises a good point, I'll probably go over it in [a series of videos I'm working on](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/o1syz/i_want_to_put_together_a_comprehensive_youtube/) (this will be primarily Soldier stuff until the season is over and I have enough demos to go over Highlander *team* stuff).

**Predictions**
 
Ginyu Force &gt; Baby Punching Marathon 2-1
 
The time has finally has come for my most anticipated match of the season: Ginyu vs BPM. Last season two of the best and closest games were fought between two teams, Ginyu of course formed of mostly Tangerine players, so I whole-heartedly expect to see a thrilling nail-biter of a match this Monday. In fact I do believe BPM might be looking for a little recompense after Tangerine knocked them out of last season’s playoffs in a narrow 3-2 victory on gullywash. But regardless of history and the outcome of this match BPM and Ginyu are and will remain good friends. Unfortunately I also happen to love hanging out with all those guys which makes this probably one of the harder matches I’ve had to predict, but after a long deliberation I’m going with Ginyu Force to clench the victory here, which will also more than likely set them up for an undefeated regular season. It’s going to be far from easy though as BPM, after 4 episodes, has finally powered up to their final and most potent form. Pulse is back from outer space and he’s ready to stomp on nerds, as is Kapoww who finally gives BPM the solid and consistent starting demo that they needed. Boink and Bronze, of course, are always ready to go buck and top frag any match they play in, and if this week were a different map (a 5cp or KOTH) I might have gone with BPM to win. I’m afraid though that BPM’s aggression will land them into trouble more often than not as they’ll feed picks and advantages to the patient and calculated beast that is Ginyu Force. Sitting at the heart of that beast on pl_barnblitz will be Cusideabelicoln, Duwatna, and Huey Lewis. My former teammate Abe will once again prove why he’s the best engineer with keen spychecking and creative gun placements. As good as Kapoww is, I don’t feel he’s taken this map as seriously as Duwatna who’s turned spamming stickies on this map into a science. BPM will have a tough time not popping early against Duwatna, and once they do they’ll Huey Lewis immediately standing in their way pushing them like a 9 lb newborn. BPM offensive capabilities are nothing to underestimate however, so if Pulse can go huge and they can secure 4 or 5 minute times I suspect Ginyu will have a tough time replicating that. Either way this’ll be one for the history books.

All our players have pretty solid DM and we're not being massively outfragged or outdamaged, but we still are losing most of our scrims. One of our main issues seem to be our pushes.

As a general example - we lost mid and are holding second, both teams have uber up. Our roamer gets a scout pick on the flank and we decide to push on it. I buff everyone up quickly and then uber in the pocket with the demo following close behind, our scouts and roamer pushing through the flank. The other team pops uber, we take a bunch of damage, I try to keep people healthy, and then, seconds later, we have like three up and are getting destroyed trying to get out.

What is the key to a successful push? What are the broad team goals and individual class goals? Has this problem been encountered and solved on anyone's beginning comp team? What kind of calls should I make during a push?

Quality Control, after a strong showing in silver, is in platinum for the first time and ready to rumble with the greats.

1355437770.0,27,self.truetf2,14t5c3,HL2/Source networking cvars explained and detailed,GreenPlasticJim,31,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/14t5c3/hl2source_networking_cvars_explained_and_detailed/,"**Source multiplayer networking basics**

Clients communicate with the server by sending and receiving 20-30(default) data packets per second.  Every TF2 server takes snapshots of the game world and entity states 66 times per second.  When a player executes and action, +foreward for example, the client sends that information in a packet to the server.  The next time the server takes a snapshot (which happens every 15 ms), the player's updated location/position/action will be sent to all clients according to each clients specific update rate.  This basic networking system creates discrepancies between player action and hit registry/visual feedback. 
 
Lag compensation, prediction and interpolation work together to smooth out these problems and generally make them a non-issue.  However these compensations do create their own problems such as face-stabs and out-of-sight head-shots, but they're well worth it. 

**Client-side networking cvars**

Ok, so now we got that out of the way.  Here's a detailed list of the network client cvars, what they do and how/why they should be modified. **Discaimer** - Don't just randomly changes these things if you have no clue what they are, you could really screw up your connection. 

*  **rate** {bytes per second, default=9999} - This cvar should be set to accurately reflect your download speed in bytes/second.  ""This is the most important network variable for clients and it has to be set correctly for an optimal gameplay experience."" - valve

*  **cl_updaterate** {snapshots per second, default is 20, max is 66} - This cvar allows the client to specify exactly how many snapshots the client receives from the server.  This number may already be limited by the server admin and is also limited by your ""rate"" cvar.
  
*  **cl_cmdrate** {packets per second, usually set around 30} - This is the amount of packets that the client sends to the server per second.  Commands you execute will be grouped into packets and sent according to this rate.  Setting it higher increases responsiveness of the game but requires more upload bandwidth. 

*  **cl_interp** {number in seconds, default is 0.1} - Interpolation is a way of smoothing events between received packets, it compensates for a low update rate or packet loss.  The default interpolation period or ""lerp"" is 100 ms, this basically means that your computer is rendering video 100 ms behind the current time.  By doing this your computer can average or interpolate events between two packets.  If you were always rendering at the current time, your computer wouldn't have both a past and a future snapshot to interpolate between.  For watching STV, where you receive fewer packets and the current time is irrelevant you can set this value high (cl_interp 1 is good).  However with the introduction of the next cvar, cl_interp_ratio, you can simply set cl_interp to it's optimal value of 0 safely.

*  **cl_interp_ratio** {default is 2} - This value is used to calculate your interp or lerp value by dividing it by your cl_updaterate value (only if this interp value is greater than your cl_interp value, this is why setting cl_interp 0 is good). If you set your updaterate to the maximum of 66 you will get an cl_interp value of 0.0151 or 15 ms. You can check your final lerp with net_graph 1.

*  **cl_lagcompensation** {boolean 1 or 0, on/off} - This value allows clients to tell the server that they don't want their own commands lag compensated.  Lag compensation effects registry for hitscan weapons.  Basically the server saves player past locations for a short time and when a player executes a hitscan command the server rewinds all other players to their location at the time the player executed that command on his computer.  You should never set this to 0 unless you want to have to lead shots. 
*  **cl_predict** {boolean, default=1} - Turns on client input prediction.  Prediction makes the game feel more natural and responsive by automatically rendering client inputs without waiting(whatever you ping may be) for the server to confirm the outcome.  Without prediction you execute a command and send it to the server.  When the server sends you back the next updated packet your action will be rendered on your computer.  
* **cl_smooth** {Boolean} - When you computer uses prediction to render your actions sometimes they conflict with the servers information.  The discrepancy between this conflict is resolved by smoothing between the client and servers information.  This cvar turns this smoothing on or off. 
* **cl_smoothtime** {seconds} - This is the amount of time the smoothing will take to smooth over and solve a prediction error.
* **cl_pred_optimize** {numbered setting} - The only thing I could find on this was- ""If it is set to 2 or above, the default for cl_pred_optimize, it will revert all predictibles back to the last predicted frame if no errors were found.""  


**Good/Bad connection configs from chris's maxfames**

Just to sort of put these cvars and their values in perspective here are the values the common video optimization cfg uses:

    //Good connection
    cl_cmdrate 66
    cl_interp 0
    cl_interp_ratio 1
    cl_lagcompensation 1
    cl_pred_optimize 2
    cl_smooth 0
    cl_smoothtime 0.01
    cl_updaterate 66
    rate 60000

    // Bad connection

I'll probably reformat when I'm home, I'm on my phone right now.

·Demo:

If I'm alone with our medic and a scout/solly is on us, should I use pipes or stickies?

When defending last, given enough time, should I sticky point or doors first?

Should I keep stickies reloaded first?

When battling mid, should I use pipes when I'm out of stickies or reload?

When should i take damage for sollies? (when they are low or getting buffed so they can jump?)

If I have a trap up, should I try to kill the most and not get the med, or try just for the med and risk not downing anyone else?

·Medic:

If I'm alone with my heavy/solly/demo, and a spy is behind us, should I go for the spy, or let my patient go for him? What if the patient is already fighting?

Similarly, if I'm heavy and am fighting, and a spy is called behind, should I abandon the enemies in front and go for the spy?

Is it more important to keep the heavy fully buffed or try to get the whole team overhealed a little?

Should I ever take damage for someone?

1375840580.0,22,self.truetf2,1jurwz,Public Servers and You,TTR0,37,15,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1jurwz/public_servers_and_you/,"So, after seeing [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1jtlyw/sometines_i_really_get_confused_at_some_peoples/) thread in /r/tf2, it made me think about how/why I play in pubs. **Look to the bottom for the TL;DR**

*Public games are what got me in love with tf2.* Seeing people that were much better than me (I was fucking terrible), and wanting to get better is what made m come back for more. I would try super hard, playing Medic often, trying to coordinate my team via voicechat. It was a great feeling winning a close round because of my well-timed uber.

The fun of winning, as well as the ridiculousness of the game is what made it so uniquely amazing for me. Being in a state of shocked, uncontrollable laughter at how quickly I died to the shiny, drunken black man wearing a pumpkin head and swinging a huge fuckin' battle ax, or barely controlled, fist-clenching rage at the Spy had just stabbed me for the 6th time, but learning with each hour played, I slowly improved.

As I improved, I realized that many people I was healing were, in fact, worse than me. I started playing different classes, and started looking for more skilled peers to play with. Hence began my interest in competitive TF2.

Fast forward to today, and I have over 3k hours played, and 3 seasons of competitive behind me.  I still play public games, but also pick up games and scrims with my team. I find my pub mindset has changed, simply because of my experience (gametime played, skill level change, and exposure to competitive). 

In an organized setting, winning is what makes the game fun for me. Things like getting a sick clutch defense, nice flank multi kill, Kritz stickysnipe make it fun: these things are what initially got me into TF2 at the pub level. 

I dont find these things fun in pubs because its too easy; the enemy is too uncoordinated, the skill level is too unbalanced. I know if I used my main class (demo), and use stickybombs, I will undoubtedly be topscorer of my team, and one of two things will have happened.

* 1. Our team will absolutely be crushing the other. I will effortlessly have 5+ doms, and I will be bored.
* 2. Our team will be losing extremely badly, despite my carry. I will still have 5+ doms, with the next highest player on my team having about half my points. I will quit out of a combination of boredom and frustration.

Pubs can be extremely frustrating for me, and other experienced players, for several reasons.

* 1. They are too easy/skill level is too disparate.
* 2. Class balance is fucked.
* 3. Teams are completely unbalanced.

Point being, I don't have fun if I play pubs seriously, but I still can have fun with them.

**Pubs are a change of pace and a change of mindset from competitive.  I derive a different type of fun from them than I do from a scrim or PUG.** 

Pubs are still fun for me for several reasons.

* 1. It doesnt matter. Class choice, weapon choice. *Team has 4 spies? Yep, I'm playing Spy.*
* 2. Can make my own little mini-games. *Hmmm... lets see if I can cause a stalemate if I build a level 3 here... Yep, I can.*
* 3. Its undoubtedly a lot more random than competitive. *The crits, spread, the players! Why, why, WHY would you chase me at 2HP when I had 3 teammates around, and kill me cuz you got a random crit* This randomness practically guarantees me scenarios I have never seen in every game.
* 4. Maps. *You just will never see dustbowl, frontier, or hightower in comp.* Yeah, they're broke, doesn't mean they're not fun.



*TL;DR* **Why do you play pubs? What makes them fun for you?**

1374332908.0,27,self.truetf2,1ip3p9,Viable pl_upward 3rd Point Hold,python1234,36,9,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1ip3p9/viable_pl_upward_3rd_point_hold/,"So the other day I (quintosh) was just playing around in pcws with my team and I've come to this viable hold on pl_upward.
(For the lazy people that don't want to read as much and like video introductions, read below)
 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDEH4LCzsA4 (BIG CREDIT TO PYTHON, for making this and helping out)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ2grcYMNpg 

This is a hold that should be executed very quickly or after a failpush from the opposing team where you push into the house with the second forward spawn for the attacking team (or the defending team's first spawn)
 
For the location calls, see:
Catwalk, Bridge, Flank route (leftish under bridge), Sewers, Shack (rightish) http://puu.sh/3H0XQ.jpg
House http://puu.sh/3H11D.jpg
 
Full hold: http://puu.sh/3xLmT.png (ignore the sticks, and thank my handwriting skills later)
 
The most important thing is to do it quickly; you sacrifice a midly-strong 2nd point hold for an incredibly strong 3rd point hold, but everyone needs to know what they need to do and when they do it.
Basically, right now the meta for the second point is to hold the hut above the usual sentry hold. Once you get pushed out of there, you fall back to 3rd. The combo runs up the stairs and the engineer should move his sentry away (should be facing like this: http://puu.sh/3H2gI.jpg). Things you can do to do that much faster is to build a tele next to the stairs and the exit somewhere near the 3rd point and then just carry your sentry into the teleport.
 
http://puu.sh/3H11D.jpg
After backing out to the spawn, the Demo sticks this door. At this point the enemy combo should try to peek in but notice it would be a failpush and push bridge. This is where the Sniper/Scout/Soldier can pick people off, and the Heavy can also spam from Catwalk. Right now it seems the only way to push the combo out of the shack is to do an uber push from the flank route, where they will be forced early, or they push the house right into the sentry sightline and main.
 
The only thing that hasn't happened until then is that your team still has uber and somehow needs to be forced. The Lv3 is also up and has a bunch of area denial. A spy should not be able to pick you off in the shack as there's one way to get you and that is to uncloak early (because the combo should hear a close spy discloak when they're like backs-to-backs with the spy) which makes the Engi able to call when he jumps up into the shack from the panel. Or you can just turn around sometimes.
So, the only way is to go face-to-face. And now the funny thing happens.
 
http://puu.sh/3H0XQ.jpg
After the push comes in, the Demo falls back to Catwalk and sets his sticks up right where I marked them. What happens if someone comes through? The Demo detonates and everyone in the blast radius drops right into the crater, and the Pyro airblasts the rest off the Catwalk, which renders it pretty much a fail push.
 
But, House, Main, Catwalk, Bridge, where should the enemy team push from?
A way for them to get anywhere is to push the whole flank route, and that's where the Pyro comes in again. If your flank dies, the Pyro should rotate to the flank routes, because the push is pretty much expectable. It should take about 20 seconds to push the whole way to the sentry nest while getting heavily damaged by the Heavy from Catwalk, and the defending Pyro has a whole idea of what's going on and can just blast people off again.
 
But how do you defeat such a strong forward hold? I don't know. I've had one opportunity to try this with my Platinum team, but we were up against one of the top 3 teams at that point and didn't really stand a chance, especially because I wrote the strategy for the team like a day before and we had a bunch of subs for the match. Pushing through this probably requires a few fake pushes through the flank or a far forward teleport and a few suicides. Maybe Bonk could come to use too.
 
Now, to sum this up with a Pros-Cons list:
 
Pros:
- Renders enemy Spy pretty much useless as the only opportunity to pick people off is to go to the flank or pick the sniper and neither will be a good pick
- Only one sightline for the enemy Sniper to get picks and that is also just the flank classes and the defending Sniper (thing is, the defending one can be anywhere on 3rd point whereas the enemy one is probably near the bridge and will be called earlier)
- Soldier pretty much useless, Heavy and Sentry have easy denial (one left, one right) on the jumping Soldier trying to force something and the only sightline for the Soldier to spam the Sentry is the place the Demo sticked off early (or the Soldier takes a lot of damage from the Sentry and I don't think a DH Soldier could take down a wrangled Lv3 by himself.
- requires the enemy team to have perfect distracting coordination and flank control (I don't think any hold on another map is harder to beat)
 
Cons:
- You need to be QUICK on giving up 2nd point. If one of the combo dies, it's crucial and you will need to hold behind the panel until a failpush comes in
- Demo dies: gg (just do the old hold then)",,False,,t5_2stfn,1374341032.0,,,True,t3_1ip3p9,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1ip3p9/viable_pl_upward_3rd_point_hold/,

I'm not certain how useful it is in pubs due to the random nature of them.

The passive regen sounds nice, and you don't have to worry about flinching if you have to charge a shot to kill a heavy class. Of course, you can hardly take any spam with it but you probably shouldn't be in a position where you're being spammed like that, right?

**Match Preview by Ally and Mystery Gamers**

My thoughts: Anddddd finally, Epsi vs who? After playing broder last week and still looking unbeatable, the champions of Europe seemed to be phased by nothing less than their champion counterparts in America. Epsilon have once again proved that stepping up in officials is still their thing and we’d have to see both a horrific performance by Epsilon and Revoluzion playing out of their skins to see the overall result here be anything but an Epsilon victory. As said countless times by countless people before, the RLM roster has the raw ability to play a top level but currently it’s too soon into their lifetime as a team to pose any real threat.

 Mystery Gamer #1 (Prediction: 5-0 Granary 5-0 Process):

“Epsilon stomping pretty much every team in officials and having overall decent results in pcws makes them the clear favourite for this match. RLM are a fairly new team and still struggle to get some team chemistry going so I highly doubt that they will be a threat for epsilon.”

Couple of points: 

 * # Logs only show quantitative features, not qualitative (big plays etc)

 * # Total amount of kills or dmg is pretty meaningless because players have different playtimes or missing logs, also many matches lasts longer than others. So stats like damage per minute or KA/D will be more useful.

 * # The spreadsheet is a work in progress and should be more aesthetically pleasing and user friendly in the future. What’s important now is that the data is all accurate as far as the original data goes.

I personally would go with shotgun. You need a strong primary that you can protect yourself with. 3 shots from the FJ and low damage drom the RR are not the same.

I could see the new weapon used on something like pl_badwater second, uber pushes through and you save your sentry.

I couldn't access reddit for some reason and only now able to view it. sorry for the delay)  
  
I was actually contemplating whether if I should use this weapon or not. On one hand, this weapon have, in my opinion, a highly negative view upon it for the wrong reasons and because of this the mere mention of it have cause the biggest rage rants I've ever seen in a game. So I want people to at least try it before they form a opinion. On the other hand, I don't want to be spammed with rage messages, but I find that unlikely because you guys have shown to at least think before you type. I think some of you have a vague idea of what weapon I'm talking about.  
  
Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you the:  
  
##BACKBURNER  
  
You know, this is one of the few weapons where its name actually explains what the weapon does.  
Lets look at what this weapon does:  
  
* 100% Critical hits from behind. The angle where you get critical hits from is 90 degrees unlike the backstab that has 180 degree angle.  
* 150% Airblast cost. Meaning, airblasts cost 50 ammo.  
  
OK, before some of you start complaining, let me explain why I took this weapon. It's true that this weapon is not underused. This weapon is not really under powered either, having a plus side that caters to a different playstyle at the cost of continued usage of one of the unique abilities the Pyro possess. So why did I choose this weapon? Because I believe many hate this weapon unfairly. Many say that this weapon caters to w+m1, which is kinda weird when you think about it. None of this weapons stats supports just running straight forward and flaming. Actually, the Stock and Degreaser supports this more since they have a reliable amount of airblast to get away to safety easier. With the BB, you basically get no benefit from charging straight on since the only time you get those criticals is when you flank your opponent, doing the opposite of a suicide w+m1.  
  
**RULES**  
  
* You have to play Pyro for at least 1 hour  
* You can't change class in the middle of the challenge  
* You have to use this weapon  
* You have to play REAL Pyro!  
  
So, that's basically why I choose this weapon for this challenge. Besides, it could be a nice change from your usual Pyro routine, so there's no harm in trying. Have fun people!

That probably sounds really obvious, but so many people don't do it.  I usually fire in 1-3 shot bursts, and most of those shots actually hit.  So instead of spraying 12 shots and landing a few, I space out my bursts and get a good hit percentage.

Now comes the winger.  If you burst-fire, there's usually enough time for the pistol's quick reload to finish.  So if you fire in bursts of less than five shots, the only difference in gameplay you see is a higher damage output.  I have only had time to try this in a pub for an hour or two, but I will give it a shot in a mix this weekend.

So what are your opinions on this thing?

I'm playing as an Engineer for KAOS this Monday and I have a little bit of a problem.

I recently realized the brilliance of the Eureka Effect. I always considered it useless until I was taught its true use. I was just in a lobby for Gravelpit and I got to work setting up a defense. 
However, it was quickly destroyed as my nest had hardly been set up. The reason? No, not because I'm a bad engie (not entirely the reason anyways)

So yeah, I right click to teleport to spawn and all I do is a little dance. That's ok, right? No. My engie does it about 2-3 times before he decides to teleport. In that time I could have upgraded my sentry and a bit more, even.

On Monday I fear that this will happen again and it'll be a huge dent on the team.

2)Make a broken RTR drop more metal, this will help the engineer rebuild faster.

3)Give the RTR a 12 sec cooldown, and make it so instead of destroying the building, it just disables it for four seconds. Make the RTR unaffected by the wrench. This will give your team a small ""window"" to knock out the enemy sentry every 12 secs.

Canteen Advantages:

+ Cheaper at first, enabling other upgrades to be bought sooner.
+ As long as you hold at least 1 charge you can guarantee you won't run out of ammo at a key moment.
+    Cheaper overall on smaller missions, assuming decent ammo preservation.
+    Can operate on the front lines for longer without an ammo pack.
+ Fills your clip instantly for free.

Upgrade advantages:

+    Frees up your canteen slot for other types.
+    You don't have to get in the habit of using canteen when at low ammo.
+    No auto weapon switch at a bad moment because you were slow on the canteen.

**General stuff:**

If you're ever running around not healing someone, this is bad. You
should have at least a general idea of what path each player will take
on a push for each point, so that you don't end up wandering around
alone. Things like this are the difference between the enemy medic
saying ""What? They had uber already?"" and you dying at 97%. On a
related note, it's usually a bad idea to use needles to defend yourself
if you could be healing a teammate. In addition to the lost uber
and health, it's almost always better to pay attention to using your
teammate to body block than to focus on aiming needles (unless you
get caught in a bad position where they're between you and your ally -
- which basically just sucks and leave you few options).

You should always be looking for opportunities to give crit heals
(and your team should be trying to play to get crit heals as much
as possible). Unless you're retreating and trying to keep people
alive, ""saving"" people is a waste of time. When you think about it,
mid fights usually get resolved 5-10s after the combo arrives. Are
you going to spend that entire 10s healing the demo from 20hp at a
pathetic 24hp/s, or are you going to spend 2s to get 2 185hp scouts
that can run in and tear things up?

Don't jump unless you're going to ride an explosion or get up on
something. This locks you into a predictable path for both hitscan and
projectile weapons. If you were playing blindfolded, you'd live longer
by mashing wasd than mashing wasd and space.

Stay focused and make decisions based on the moment you're in, not
what happened 2s ago. If a soldier jumps at you and you're at 97%,
don't pop right when you hit 100 if you managed to get a surf and he
doesn't have a shot. Don't duck past splash around a corner if the guy
who was going to splash you died as you went there. If their combo
was close on the corner 5s ago, don't pop around the corner unless
you know they're still there.

**Uber stuff:**

If you get shot for 50 damage and you don't know what hit you,
pop uber. You got flanked by a scout or soldier and will die on the next
hit.

Milking your uber is good until you do it too much. It's way
better to pop 1s early 10 times than to let your pocket die once
because you think you can clutch it at 10hp. Rule of thumb: assume
that every fragging class nearby will be able to do 100 damage to
your target right away (because they can), and pop accordingly to not
drop anyone. Also, it's almost always better to pop on a 200hp soldier
than to pop on a 50hp soldier and have a 1s longer uber... if you get
juggled apart or need to flash it around and can't get that soldier back
to 200+ by the end of the charge, you're going to get messed up.
Basically, you don't want to be ""saving"" people with uber, you want to
be blocking big spikes of damage.

When the other team ubers while you have uber, and you have
multiple players in the area, the correct response is to push your
pocket+medic forward, not to have everyone back up together. The
situation you want to create is to have non-uber players far back,
and your single soldier up in their face to force a split and chase
them down, perhaps just giving 1 flash to save your demo from an
aggressive pocket. If you let them push you back, they'll be able to
force you to split and kite away from your uber, but if you charge
them, their medic must run or he dies.

You can use an uber without using it (zen). If the other team
does not have their charge, they will likely be playing far back with
their combo so they don't take a 70% death or something like that.
As a result, you can often take a point without popping, because
the threat of you popping keeps them away. The only reason to pop
around a corner is if you know you're going to take a damage spike
there and you need to get in to do damage fast, or if their combo is
holding right there and you're going for an uber exchange.

Despite what frag videos may lead you to believe, it's very hard
to get the enemy medic to drop uber by using a kritz. What you should
be looking for when kritzing is to force a pop with your combos far
apart, and get big damage in by landing some splash. If you try to
ram a kritz into a combo that has uber, you will get ubered on and die,
since the very visible yellow flecks in your beam are broadcasting your
intentions. Also, the comments about milking uber apply doubly so to
kritz: the main damage from a kritz comes in the first shot. If you pop
too late and miss that first shot, you are certainly not going to make
up for it with the 1s longer kritz you have (generally time you spend
waving your mouse around looking for enemies that have long since
scattered).

**Team stuff:**

If you hit mid without both soldiers at 300, something is wrong.
Gully is the only example I can think of where you arrive with less
(because it's so short and you can't equalize). On every other map you
should always have 1 soldier equalize, the other soldier jumps to the
cabinet (if there is one -- if not he waits for crit heals) then keep pace
with the medic. The ideal healing pattern is demo, tag soldier before
first jump (if he has crit heals -- if he jumped to a cabinet, can skip),
back to demo, tag scouts before out of range, stick on soldier, crit
heal other soldier at mid. There's no reason not to spend 5 minutes
straightening this out with your soldiers, not doing this is like letting
them have a free direct rocket every mid.

There are 2 things you can do to win in TF2. You can attack,
or you can defend. If you're not doing either of these, you're losing.
This is especially true when you have some kind of disadvantage -
- less charge, med just died, less players up, etc. If you play super
aggressive on their med*, you might get a pop/kill and even things out
on the next spawn wave. If you give up ground to buy time for your
uber, or spawns, or whatever, you can even things out. If you push up
to standard positions you'd hold if it was 6v6 even uber, and try to win
DM vs people with more health and numbers, you bleed players out
and lose points/take longer to recover than you should. Don't do this.

*By the way, a good technique for doing suicidal plays is to
show your combo, then bust out the jumps from your other players.
If they never see your combo, they can say ""oh, it's a suicide, we
can just back up and frag these guys then push in"". Just showing the
combo and throwing spam puts way more pressure on -- even if they
clairvoyently recognize that you're really trying to suicide, you can just
slam your combo into them if they try to run the med, so you force
them to take it.

You will lose the round if you sit on your last point. You should
always consider being on last as a ""well, we're screwed"" situation and
be trying to get out of there, not sitting and hoping for a wipe. Push
out with everyone and rely on covering doors to block backcaps. Sure,
you'll get messed up by spies from time to time if you're too slow
capping 2, scouts will slip by and get it, whatever. Keeping your demo
or combo locked on the last point and hoping you can deny endless
pushes is a more likely path to defeat than risking a backcap is.

**Part 2**

**Know your advantages**

* Check Scoreboard very often.
* To know when you have an advantage, look for:
* Man Advantage (Whoever has more players up)
* Uber Advantage (whoever has uber or not)
* When healing hurt players it takes about 40 seconds to charge a uber. When you have it and they
don't...push right into them. If they have it and you do not, stay more passive and play defensively.
 
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGXfcN7dfUU

    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL7Tzq168Bs&amp;feature=related

    I found these videos to be very helpful, you should have these numbers memorized as a medic,

  I even suggest showing them to your team, so they know. So with this knowledge expect an uber approximately 40 seconds after a medic spawns or pops. (A sticky note on the edge of my monitor helped me memorize during scrims)

* Health Advantage - If a players tells your team that he did a lot of damage on the enemy (demoman most likely says this), then go right into them if your team has the players and health.
* Spawn Advantage - This means if a team doesn't get foward respawn after they cap middle for example, but you pushback and capture. Then the second point should be safe to walk in and start capping.
* Your heal order at the beginning of a round is VERY important. You and your team must work together to
be fully buffed and ready for the middle fight.
    Your heal order should be:
    At beginning of round, BUFF demo
    Demo takes his jump to door
    Continue buffing him.
    While this is going on, your roaming soldier should take two jumps to the door and get around 40-60health. Then equalize to mid.
    After the freeze time is over, (the time when no one can move in spawn before the round starts). Buff your pocket soldier, he will have crit heals, which means just tapping him with the heal beam will benefit him a lot. It will make his first several jumps a lot more effective and easier on you so you wont have to heal him from low hp. Your pocket soldier SHOULD NOT JUMP in spawn. He should wait for your heal at the beginning before making a jump.
    While you are walking out of the door of spawn then you can grab your scouts as they are running. It's really helpful for a scout to get the buff, though maybe an amount of it will wear off before the fight, it will allow them to take some shots before they dive into the enemy to get kills. Always grab both scouts.
    Your pocket should be jumping with you the entire way to middle,(he should not be too far ahead or behind) right before you reach the middle point, your roamer should then be taking off the equalizer and buffed to 300 to do damage.

    so, Demo&gt;Pocket Soldier&gt;Scouts&gt;Roamer

**At Middle:**

I do not like how you and your team fell behind your train on Badlands middle. If you do the rollout I
explained, you should be able to have a buffed team. I recommend getting your team on the point and
you can position yourself either on the point, or on top of the train, but always with your team keeping
them healthy.

Being behind that train is just asking the enemy team to spam you out because that area is very small.
Spread more heals to everyone on the team. Your scouts should be coming by and getting buffs often.
Your pocket does not have to be at 300 at all times, but he should always have an eye on your back and
your safety, no matter what he does. Keep the demo healed most of the team, a healthy demo with 8
stickies reloaded is deadly.

Medic is all about decision making. I was impressed by your instinct to go in for needles or ubersaws. And
how you avoided confrontation and got out of some situations. So great job and keep that up. When a
scout is on you and you have your pocket, I saw you went inside his player model to dodge a shot, That's
a great decision, not many people know that. Hopefully that was intentional.
I really didn't get to see much of your pushes, since you were on the defense a lot, but we can talk about
that later.

On last, when the enemy comes in with uber and takes out your pocket that was charging your uber for
you. Just try to fall back in spawn and rotate around to the left side. Don't stand there and hope they will
forget about you.

The text of the guide -
__________________________
Thanks to Tomeron for giving me this tip.

This method is basically all about **[muscle memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory)**. You want to train your muscles and reactions to know exactly how much to move your arm/wrist to place the crosshair in a precise place, without having to judge the distance or think too much about it.

All you need for this is a simple exercise. To set it up, download the map ""[tr_aim_training](http://www.gamebanana.com/maps/104304)"" to your *Steam\steamapps\userID\team fortress 2\tf\maps* folder and create a local server in TF2 using the + button on the main screen. Join the server as BLU. The class doesn't particularly matter but it would be best to disable weapon models with `r_drawviewmodel 0` in console. It has several rooms, with moving targets for practising airshots and tracking and things. But the one we are interested is directly to your left when you spawn. A long room with a raised platform and a coloured star-shaped target pattern on the far wall.

It isn't critical which position (blue circle) you stand in but it is probably easiest to use the one nearest the target. At this point you have probably noticed the annoying sound of the resupply closet constantly opening and closing to replenish your health and ammo. I'd suggest at this juncture that you turn off the game volume either in your OS's sound mixer or in console using `volume 0`. Stick on some music or whatever, because this takes some time.

What you want to do is put your cursor on the centre dot. Then, rather like those shuttle-runs you probably did in PE,  you want to move from the starting position to the first dot above, then back to the middle, then out to the next, and so on. [Here is a demonstration video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dU9-fN1Az0). Do this for the entire pattern. There's no need to do it in this particular order: if you want you can go to the first dot on each, then the second, working outwards in a spiral. The main point is that you return to the centre each time. Go as slowly as it takes for you to be precise. At the beginning you should be moving much slower than in the linked video. This is not meant to emulate real-game conditions, but to get your motions smooth and accurate. You can click on the dot to get a notification of whether or not you hit or not, but shooting is not required for this exercise to work.

Do this routine for ten or fifteen minutes and you should notice an immediate improvement. As well as repeating it to improve speed, this exercise may also come in handy when adapting to new a new mouse, sensitivity, or screen.

This was of particular benefit to me as a Spy, as the Revolver is an underutilized weapon which is capable of dealing some impressive ranged damage.

The training should also help you with Sniper quickscopes. Move your crosshair to the target first *and then* scope. Even with differing sensitivity in scoped mode (which can be disabled with `zoom_sensitivity_ratio`), you should be able to land shots with much greater consistency.",,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,,True,t3_oyecg,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/oyecg/i_made_a_muscle_memory_training_demo_video_to_go/,

What makes a team ""good"", and what can a team go about doing to improve these things?",diplodicus_,25,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1j543m/a_bit_of_meta_what_makes_a_team_good_and_what_can/,"So today our demo scheduled a scrim for our team, and right before we started, he said ""Oh and by the way, this is a platinum team."" We're in steel, albeit probably better than all the steel teams and quite a few silver teams (scrims). I recognized some of the names beforehand, but nonetheless it came as a surprise that we were going to play such a good team.

Anyways, we were against them on badwater defense first, and they capped in about 5:45, taking out a lot of our players and making our defense more of a scramble to get damage out than anything. That was a decent time, in my opinion, considering the circumstances. 

Once we were on offense, we had no hope in hell of capping the first point. We died on cliff countless times, and we were, like before, in a scramble to take down their sentry by means similar to throwing pebbles at it. 

This got me thinking. What were they doing that we couldn't manage? It's not purely dm, since a team with great dm but no teamwork couldn't do anything against a team with good teamwork. There has to be something *else* they had, an X-factor, or many X-factors, that made them so much more efficient at shutting down another team. 

What do you think is so different about higher level play compared to lower level play? Also, I don't want to hear answers saying simply ""teamwork"", since that won't help anyone at all. What specific things are different, and why do they work a lot better?

One last thing, since I'm always looking to help my team (and myself) get better at playing competitive, how can a team (or an individual) go about improving these things? Aside from sheer practice, of course, since that *always* helps. What sort of y-factor will make our x-factor better?

TL;DR : **What makes teams better than others, and how can a team go about improving these things?**

I just tested this. I only crashed when checking the Sniper loadout which i had the hatless Sniper hat on.
I then used item Quickswitch to switch a different hat on all of my loadouts. (Open quickswitch and press 6) And my game was fine. Before i had done anything when i clicked on Sniper my game would crash instantly, it wouldn't show any new screens with my loadout.

After i switched an Ellis Cap on i could watch my loadout for like a second. I had 4 loadouts all with the hatless Sniper on and it seems that after it loaded all the loadouts it noticed that they had the hatless Sniper on and the game would crash. Now that i fixed all of the loadouts to have Ellis Cap i can customize my loadout freely as long as i don't put the hatless Sniper on.

I'm assuming this affects all hatless hats.

To help out with this, [TJB (Team MeanMode)](http://thejaybelmont.blogspot.co.uk), Noddy (CrySomeMore) and myself (Gangnam Style) had a chat about teams to watch, the map of the week, upsets, UGC news, everything you want.

Pros:

Performance aside, not rendering ragdolls makes it clear when you've killed someone, because their body instantly disappears. So there's no need to check the killfeed to be sure, or to look twice at the body. There's also no bodies lying around the battlefield. It cuts down on visual clutter and frees up space on the front page of /r/tf2.

Cons:

The spycicle ragdolls are also removed, so if there's a spycicle spy in the area you won't have that visual indicator that there's a spy about. Of course if your team has good comms, the spy shouldn't be undetected for long, but it will take a few seconds longer to get to you then it might have otherwise.

And if you're playing spycicle spy, you aren't really aware of the bodies you're leaving behind that might serve as a warning to other players.


So what do you think? Ragdolls on or off? Is there any information I'm leaving out?

I kept my mini sentries up and they did a ton of assists.

And I think I did a good job keeping a base up behind the point. Their spy focused down my teles, so kudos to him.


The map is dm intensive and with a aggressive and dm based team that Maxlander was, the game was pretty fast paced. And fun!

Lakeside is one of my favorite maps because of how fast it is.

An interesting tidbit that I'd like to point out is that this is the 3rd match in a row where I've been either top 1 or top 2 in ka/d in the game and have had the least amount of deaths in every game so far.

Furthermore, do you think that the fact that you have to wear the hat to get the bonuses makes the set a little less effective? If I see an enemy spy with the familiar fez, I automatically assume he could decloak silently. 

Should there be more polycount sets in the future that require a hat? Should there be more polycount sets in the future like the Expert's Ordinance for Demoman that only require you to equip a set of weapons (no hat required).

Mostly, these don't exist, my friend and I both only had particles 1 and 6 in our particles directory, this may be different for different people. When you are online it doesn't matter that they don't exist (not entirely sure why), but when offline, the particles.txt file will go to the directory listed in the txt file and find that the particles don't exist.

First thing I checked was does it flare jump? The answer is yes. It allows you to do a very very small flare jump, like not even worth doing even smaller than before the detonator buff, flare jump. It only does about 15 self damage but that doesn't really matter since the jump can't be used for much of anything. The next thing is the damage. It deals about 15 damage per hit and the same afterburn as a flare. No crits, no minicrits. Just 15s each time. Shafted. Now for the interesting part: The knockback. This is sorta useful but only for spamming. You're able to sit in a choke point and knock enemies back a bit as they enter, however, you're only getting to deal about 15 damage and you'll be lucky to light multiple enemies. 

Next up is the explosive area for burn. This actually can be a bit interesting being that if you hit an enemy who is in range of another enemy, you're going to burn them both. Also, if you hit a wall or floor near an enemy you burn them, however, the area of detonation is about the same as the detonator so I don't know why anyone would use this weapon. It's basically a nerfed Detonator. There were a few times where I straight missed a shot but because it hit a wall it ignited someone but other than that, this isn't a utility weapon, this is a spam weapon. It doesn't help puff n sting at all, in fact, I'd say it makes it much worse since it throws people randomly, depending on what part of your body your flare hits, and often out of axtinguishing reach and even burning reach. It's uses consisted of me throwing a heavy back from peaking a few times but eventually he just mowed me down.

Maybe I'm crazy, but I think that this is a poor decision. If you ask me, there's no real arguable reason behind it. You could claim ""casual players like it more"" but that's very, very subjective, and not a very substantial argument. Even if they were to allow damage spread to be off, most servers would probably keep it on.

I like playing on pubs. Joining a random server and just having fun, and that's much easier with quickplay. I like to think I'm pretty good, but I also like a challenge. That said, I really hate feeling like I died not because I got outplayed, but because I got the short end of the random-number-generator-stick.

I'd be hugely in favor of petitioning valve to change this, honestly. I've always felt that random damage spread hurts the game because it intensifies the lottery feeling of gameplay, much more even than random criticals, because they at least aren't every shot. Too often I die to an enemy with 1-10 health, thinking ""well I lost the random damage lottery.""

Beyond that, melee becomes even more of a shitting contest than it normally is. Playing pyro and sneaking up on a sniper, meleeing him twice with my powerjack only for him to THEN figure out I'm there, turn around and hit me for 73 damage (or just crit me, but that's a rant for a different argument) is the worst experience I can think of.",,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,,True,t3_v7jqg,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/v7jqg/quickplay_and_damage_spread/,

In case you aren't aware, UGC is an organization that hosts competitive TF2, and our Highlander organization is the biggest in the world.  Highlander, for you newer players, is a mode of competitive play in which there's only one member of each class on a team for a total of 9 players.  That means that no matter what your favorite class is, you can play and compete against other enthusiasts of all types.

So far, we have had over 200 new teams sign up, which doesn't count any of our hundreds of teams from our previous seasons.  Highlander is growing quickly and we want you to be part of the action.  There are rewards for everyone, too - last season we gave away [Genuine Participant Medals](http://www.ugcleague.com/files/images/season6_medals_final.jpg) to everyone who participated in a full season of play, and we raffled off some nice unusuals to nine lucky winners.

This season we're mixing things up and trying out some new maps, many of which are custom and have never seen Highlander play before.  This season we won't be doing playoffs so there won't be medals, but we hope you still take the opportunity to join and get comfortable with a new team, so that you guys can open up a can of whoop-ass in the Fall season.

You don't have to organize a team to be part of UGC - a lot of teams are looking for new players!  There will be links at the bottom to our recruiting area so that you can join a team, possibly tonight!  Do well enough and you could just be considered for our [All-Star Match](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07GfhRY6Cfo), which we do for both levels of our organization, Platinum and Steel.

___

So where do you get started?  If you already have a team and a server, you can sign up your team with us [on our website](http://www.ugcleague.com).  If you're a fresh recruit looking to join a new team, check out our [Recruitment Forums](http://www.ugcleague.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=18), where you can post your skills and join a new team that's just as awesome as you are.  Remember our first match drops on the 11th of June, so get on it!

If you have any questions about our organization or about Highlander in general, please feel free to ask me.  The staff here at UGC is excited to see the interest we already have in this season and we'd love to see more!

Be sure to get your team registered by June 6th if you're making a team - otherwise we can't promise you'll be scheduled to play this summer!",,False,,t5_2stfn,False,,flair-medic,True,t3_u86dd,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/u86dd/ugc_season_7_is_starting_soon/,
1338052917.0,23,self.truetf2,u662b,Hi /r/truetf2 I've got this idea and I need your opinions.,TF2_Mongoose,28,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/u662b/hi_rtruetf2_ive_got_this_idea_and_i_need_your/,"Hello everybody on [/r/truetf2](http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2),

**Direct question for people that don't like to read:** Should I livestream my MGE/DM sesions so you guys can learn anything/ be  entertained?

**backstory:**
I've been pubbing for around 1800 hours now, after a while around 800 hours a friend suggested me to play competitve but I never got in to it.
Now I read this subreddit for a while now and have read almost all the posts about getting into competitve play and how to get better and so  on, and it  made me really excited to play competitve tf2.
The one thing that is said numerous times is that if you want to be good at the game (death matching wise) you need to practice in MGE or DM servers or even better than normal pub servers (shoutout to RUCG servers) and I fully agree with that.
That's when I got this idea.

**The idea:**
My idea is to fully concentrate on DMing for atleast 100 hours in MGE and DM servers.
But I thought: Why should I do this on my own why not involve you guys?
So I came up with this idea that I can stream some MGE/DM sesions on twitch.tv and maybe do some youtube video's about MGE matches I had so I can be a helpfull contributer to the tf2 community.
I want to do it as perfectly as humanly possible so it's gonna take me some time to 1. set up and 2. to actually do it. 

So if you bared with me all the way through this wall of text my question to you guys is: Should I put some time into doing this or shouldn't I bother with it?

I look forward to all your opinions,

Mongoose. 

PS: Srry for my bad english it's not my first language.
PPS:If you guys like this idea I'll make a second post about the more detailed stuff that Im going to do.

If there is interest, I would like to know whether the interest is for 6v6 commentary, or pub commentary.
For sixes, I would just go over a demo of myself, and explain why I did what, and try to squeeze some good tips in.

For pubs, I could do any class except Engie/Heavy/Spy/Pyro. (In order from ""definitely not"" to ""you might be able to convince me."")

1315109965.0,22,self.truetf2,k43mq,The Scottish Resistance: A (Decent) Guide,PattyPegface,25,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/k43mq/the_scottish_resistance_a_decent_guide/,"I've been using the SR almost exclusively when on defense now, and it is absolutely the *best* defense weapon a Demoman has. Here's some ways to use it and why (forgive my poor editing, I'm new to reddit).

**Where to Set Up**

1. Set up in a nice chokepoint where there are tight spaces and it's hard for the enemy to maneuver. This is usually a corridor in a building. Make sure that this place is going to get very heavy, heavy traffic. You don't want to camp a place that the enemy isn't using.

2. Consider setting up in a place *behind* the front lines, where the enemy can funnel through to destroy your team from behind. This is especially effective at denying Spies and other Demomen that want to kill the Sentries you're team has (hopefully) built.

**Where to Place Stickies**

1. Because you have many, many more stickies than usual, and because you don't have to detonate them all at once, you can place several traps. 

2. For the first trap, the ""forward"" or ""main"" trap, place 4-5 stickies. This is enough to take out every class in the game, even with overheal. 

3. Next, place 3-4 stickies along a route not too far from this area. This will be the secondary trap, for just in case more enemies come out after the first trap is detonated. 

4. Finally, add one or two more traps, depending on what you like. There can be a tertiary trap if you really think you need one, and, hey, you can afford the stickies. However, you *must* place a trap behind you if there's a back entrance where the enemy can surprise you.

5. Back into a corner where you can't be backstabbed and yet you can see your traps. Also, make sure you can detonate them individually. Sometimes they can overlap in your FOV, which defeats the whole purpose of the SR.

6. Try and place these stickies where the enemy won't see them before it's too late, such as around corners or even on the top of doorways and on ceilings.

7. Replace your sticky traps as needed.

**What Not to Do**

1. Don't leave your spot unless you have to. The enemy could come out whenever, and you have to be ready.

2. Don't go into direct combat. Use the sticky launcher if you want direct combat. The SR is an entirely defense Demoman.

**Additional Notes**

1. Turn ""Cart Glow"" on in your settings. This will allow you to see where you stickies are through walls, and will also make them light up with your cursor is over them, indicating that they're ready to detonate.

2. Make sure you equip the right primary in case the enemy *does* manage to get to you. If you'fe in a tight space, go with the regular grenade launcher. If you're in a more open space and you have good aim, the Loch N' Load isn't actually that terrible. It's especially effective against Pyros who can airblast your traps away. They usually charge straight forward, allowing both shots to hit for a kill.

3. Remember to never detonate your stickies while you're on top of them. Even though you're not looking at them, they still detonate when under you (for sticky jumping, which you usually won't have to do).

4. If you're on a CP or even a Payload, try to leave about 3 or 4 (maybe 5) stickies on the control point. This is in case the front lines break or if a Spy attempts to Spy-cap. Unless there's a Pyro who knows how to airblasts, they won't attempt to destroy the stickies, giving you an easy kill.",,False,,t5_2stfn,True,,,True,t3_k43mq,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/k43mq/the_scottish_resistance_a_decent_guide/,

With the L'etranger, the cloak is comparable in duration to the stock watch and I noticed I have little trouble pushing far back into enemy lines. Except now I have the added bonus of being able to stalk the enemy, recharging my cloak and setting up for a big pick.


I've also tried running this set with the IW and the effect is similar in that I have tremendous ability to push through the line. But there is often many situations where I don't know what to do with the extra cloak. 14 seconds of cloak + regen from ammo is a TON. It's almost too much in a way and I find myself not using it all. I suppose I could need it if I were not near an ammo pack but there is usually plenty for me to grab.

What I mean with crouch-jump lag and rubberbanding is:

Crouch-jump lag: When you crouch-jumped, your view would bob up weirdly, and it would feel delayed - almost as when you're rocketjumping with a high ping. The bug occured for people with no internet problems (ie. a person with 0 loss, 0 choke, good rates and 30 ping would still experience) it, but it still became worse the higher your ping was and the lower the maximum allowed rates that the server had was. 

Rubberbanding: Feels like you're getting teleported around randomly, but not in an instant - it feels fast and sudden, and yet in a smooth motion. It feels like the server is ""guessin"" where you are and automatically put you back to that position. Could also be noticed happening on other players in 3rd person. It was the same as the crouch-jump lag, in the sense that it could happen to any person with completely fine internet, ping and net settings, but it would still become worse the higher your ping was.

As it seems right now, most people are considering this issue fixed for them. I still know a handful of people who continue to experience it, including myself. Verifying and reinstalling hasn't done the trick. 

From what I've noticed, it seems that defragging your .vpk-files with a program that is NOT the Windows Defragging Tool will make the issue occure less frequently. It also seems like INCREASING your rate (rate ""randomnumber"" in console).
Yesterday I also noticed that setting cl_predict to 0 can make it better.

Right now I'm trying to make a big part of the community (and last but not least Valve themselves) realize that the rubberbanding issue is NOT because of your internet connection - it is a nasty bug in the game that needs immediate attention. Besides that, I also want to find out many people are experiencing it, and if all the ""victims"" have the same symptoms.

So anyone who is still experiencing this rubberbanding issue, can you do me a favor? First of all, try to record a video showing it. 
After that, try doing these 3 things:
* Defragging
* Increasing your rate
* cl_predict 0

...and show your results here. If you feel like it, I would also love if you could play a bit around with the net settings in the game and see if you can notice any patterns or things that improve/worsen the rubberbanding.

**Predictions**
 
Kimberlite Council &gt; Death Marked Soldiers 2-1 by Pudding Cup

Kimberlite has really been progressing nicely as a team this season. They’ve had several clutch wins and even through the losses they’ve remained remarkably stable for a fresh team in platinum. I’m waiting to see what these guys will be capable of after this season, and cp_steel just so happens to be one of those maps that really forces a team to grow and evolve. They’ll be facing off against long-time platinum residents DMS who are no doubt well-versed on steel, so I expect a lot of good rounds to be had. We’ll have to see if KLITE can bring their teamwork to the next level or if DMS will use their experience to edge out the victory. My money is on KLITE though.

To win this map you have to control mid and you need players everywhere.  Because the intel caps in the middle and the intel can't be capped while the other team has yours, the best thing to do is just be super aggressive and keep as many of your players on mid as possible.  Here's a quick rundown of where I'd send each class:

* heavy/medic/demo  -  Stay up top, above mid.  Drop down to defend the cap area if the other team is trying to cap.  Push across the bridge with uber and clear out the opposing teams intel room just long enough for your soldier or scout to get out with the intel

* engineer/pyro  -  Stay below mid and control the cap area.  Mini sentries work great, a pyro can prevent a cap with air blasts.  When you need help your combo can drop down and protect you.  If you can get a tele that goes uptop so the combo can easily re-group.  

* soldier/scout - Roaming yard, responding to help your pyro/engineer and sniper.  Stay alive so you can quickly grab intel when your combo pushes

* sniper -  Roaming yard or up top with your combo, there are some good hiding spots around yard that allow you to peak across mid and defend the capture point. 

* spy - spend a lot of time in their intel room, calling out sentry locations and trying to time saps.  spy can be super effective when your team is grabbing the intel - you can decloak under the spawns and get easy stabs as the other team is chasing whoever has their intel out the left or right doors.  Otherwise just roam and be annoying. 

**The perfect push** -  Spy is already in, ready to sap and get clean up kills/stabs. Combo pushes from up-top, demo gets ubered in first, takes down the sentry and puts out some damage, heavy gets the last couple seconds of the uber(probably drops down) to do a little clean up.  Soldier and scout flank in left or right just as the uber causes enough of a distraction for someone to grab the intel. If the solly grabs intel he can easily jump uptop and be out.  Scout should leave with the intel where-ever there is least resistance.  Call which way you are leaving with the intel and your pyro/engie who are controlling yard can meet you halfway to protect you or finish the carry.  Everyone should get out of their intel as soon as their intel is grabbed.  Combo just walks up the stairs and resets up-top.  Clean cap and everyone resets to their usual duties.  

That's about it.  Just play it fast and aggressive, stay alive if you're a fast capping class (solly/scout).  Control mid and you win, you can completely ignore your intel room if you're watching flanks and controlling mid effectively.  If you get wiped, you may want to throw a mini in the intel and have your combo regroup there and then re-push mid as a team.

**Predictions**

12 &lt; mix 4-5 by highwayunicorn

Match of the week candidate right here, with both teams being 3-1 and looking like the best challengers to bp for now. Mixup have only lost to b4nny's squad, and despite their rust and lack of coordination, they made it close in the final rounds; maybe that loss will fuel them to practice a little harder and a little more. To best Fully Torqued, they will definitely need to - PYYYOUR's team has been doing lengthy map review sessions and working their asses off for Gullywash week with two tough matches to play. Seagull going against TLR on pocket will be a classic to watch for sure, and it might honestly come down to their uber exchanges as to who wins. Yz50 has been playing well in scrims lately and looks poised for a big game, but Justin's sniping plays should open some big holes in transition that will deny Yz's chances to make plays.

When I play normal demo, my GL only gets touched for airshots, and even then I try to sticky them out of the air if they're coming long distance (Which I did a few times and felt very rewarding) I do mostly aerial/artillery style of demo, as in M1 + M2 in mid-air and most of the times (In pubs) I completely dominate, although that's only when I'm relaxed (Only when playing pubs, I get too anxious in lobbies and end up messing up). Today, I was practicing my Grenade Launcher aim with a demoknight set (Grenade Launcher, Targin' Charge, Bottle for max health) and I absolutely dominated... as in whatever team I was on we won even if the other team had a heavy medic. I'm not saying it'd be the same in MGE or Lobbies, but I found it was a lot easier to aim when I couldn't rely on my sticky bomb launcher. I made airshots, shots on mid-air scouts, and all that noise. Thing is, I still end up missing most of the times when I have the Sticky Launcher with me because it's what I rely on. 


So, to clarify... I normally suck with grenade launcher when I have sticky launcher out because I relied on the Sticky launcher too often and took out the Grenade Launcher in spur-of-the-moment decisions... like hitting an airshot or if I'm out of ammo fighting a scout. When I equipped the Chargin' Targe, I ended up dominating an entire server, even a heavy + medic pair that was actually using communication (I know because I switched teams when it was clear it was stacked). 

I was thinking, would it be best to train yourself individually, rather than with both, since most likely you'd prefer using one to the other and the other wouldn't get used that much. So, how about these loadouts for practicing using them...

*Ali Baba Wee's Boots* (For increased health, since you wouldn't be using the Grenade Launcher, so a max of 200 health, overhealed to 300)

*Stickybomb Launcher* (Obviously)

*Melee of your choice*

*Grenade Launcher* (No Loch and Load)

range)

But then I joined a Team to compete in the Round Robin V. It was the first time I ever played with so many people in a Mumble in a competetive Setting (Highlander). This is when my problems began. Whenever I play with my team, I'm supernervous, never sure where i should move, stand and watch and I'm missing the easiest shots I can imagine and missing all my jumps (playing Soldier). These problems occur nearly everytime, no matter if we play in the Tournament (round robin), a scrim or just against some randoms in a lobby.

4. You gotta play REAL soldier. (no kamikaze equalizer rushes when you spawn, no half zatoichi, no mantreads/market gardner etc.)



**Also:**

Before you start, tell me in the comments what your thoughts on the banner are. Then, when you finish, reply to that comment telling everyone what you have learned, and if you will use it more in the future.

I've gotten some big support from the community and from UGC for doing this, and it's been great being able to provide these guides for you guys.  Yes, I'm aware that it's still very much a work in progress, but that's where I could use your assistance.

Much of the strategy I cover comes from my own experience, common sense, and whatever demos I can get my hands on.  However, Highlander demos are very difficult to acquire on most of this season's maps (Foundry was an obvious one, as was follower).  Playing the current week's map in lobby only goes so far as to understand the current Highlander team mechanics.

Therefore, I'm humbly asking access to watching your scrims, from week to week, to understand how these maps are being played currently in order to provide a better guide for everybody.  I'd be more than happy to include your team in the thanks for the video and whatnot.  All I'd need is a few hours' notice by someone from your team that has the STV information.  Reddit works fine for getting me the information.

**FOR CLARITY:**  If you have a scrim on the next week's UGC map on Tues-Fri, let me know!  (For example, this week, scrims on Lakeside).  I want to start getting these articles on a regular schedule, probably Friday evenings.

Thanks again for the opportunity to share some of my insight with the larger community.  With your help, I'd like to make these guides a standard tool in any Highlander team's toolbox.  

If you can help, let me know through my private mailbox, leaving a team name, STV, and scrim time.

1373699417.0,22,self.truetf2,1i7hit,soldier melee thoughts (current patch),Sqozza,27,5,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/truetf2/comments/1i7hit/soldier_melee_thoughts_current_patch/,"I enjoy writing about this kinda thing, so I figured I'd give it a go. Anyway, with the recent (actually quite severe) escape plan nerf, it's not the instant go-to weapon for soldiers, obviously. I'm going to try and cover my personal thoughts/uses for each melee in 6's, so don't take these as fact. Anyway, onto the weapons!

In the Escape Plan's current form, I feel it's almost useless for what it was originally used for (escaping - *escape* plan.) due to the minicrits while it's equipped, and for 1.5 seconds after you put it away. On paper, minicrits don't seem too bad, as the damage buff isn't too substantial (35%) and that's not *really* all that much if you're running away. But what really kills the weapon as an effective choice now (at least for roamers, pockets will still need it for rollouts, although after that it's up for debate) is the fact that minicrits have precisely zero damage falloff. This means as you're running out of Granary mid on 40hp, there's a fairly high chance you can be oneshot by a scattergun from across mid. 

I feel the best way to go about nerfing this weapon from its previous state without butchering it like so would be a % increase in damage taken, so if you really are severely overextended there's still a lesser chance of you surviving, but you're not going to get completely fucked if you're trying to avoid being mopped after a bad midfight/push. I'm not sure what percentage increase would be good, but maybe the same as minicrits bonus to keep the effect around at close range, while not ruining your day with 70 damage rocket splash from across a mid.

The Pain Train is pretty much my favorite thing, I used it religiously for two seasons of roaming soldier - allows for clutch miracle caps with a fairly minor disadvantage (10% more bullet damage taken) for what I feel is a great upside, 2x cap rate as soldier. Now that the Escape Plan has been nerfed into Arena, I feel this will be picked up by a lot more roamers, if not a large majority of roamers (I'm unsure for global unlock rules, so the whip is also a potentially viable choice, but I'll run over that shortly.) Before this particular update, the main reason to not use the paintrain was that the Escape Plan's ability to get you far far away from stupid situations that you manage to get yourself into as roamer was valued far more by most roamers compared to the ability to backcap and generally be a nuisance - I'm not trying to say it's a crutch by any means, rather that it was simply all round the best choice for most situations, whereas everything else is more situational.

Anyway, the Pain Train's downside (10% more bullet damage taken) basically means scouts are 10% more annoying, and as far as I know this slightly effects bullet knockback when you're doing dives, so I suppose that's something to take in consideration as well. In theory, this isn't too much of a penalty, turns a 100 damage shot into a 110 damage shot, meaning you'll get 2shot instead of...2shot. This is a bigger issue on demoman where you don't have 200 hitpoints, but I don't play demoman. You shouldn't really be picking 1v1's with scouts as a roaming soldier anyway, you should be baiting them around into your scouts, forcing them into 2v1's and as said before, generally being a nuisance - this is your job as a roamer, the +10% bullet damage taken is less of a problem if you play well. 

As for the whip, this is entirely theory (I actually had to look up stats on the wiki for this!) so I'll probably be horribly wrong here. I think the main use of this will be keeping your team as mobile as possible, while trading off the utility of the other melee weapons - however a 26%-40% speedboost on rollout for your core classes is actually something that in my head sounds great, and would give your team a reasonably significant advantage on rollout, under the assumption the other team isn't using one too. Demoman gets a 37.5% speedboost from the whip, so give him a few hits on rollout and he'll likely get there noteably faster than the other guy, which can decide a midfight from the get go.

And last, the Market Gardener. Unless you're some kind of [wizard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxl7EN0APOs) I can't imagine using it over the other options available.
