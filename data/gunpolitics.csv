1359179253.0,98,self.gunpolitics,17axgl,"Feinstein's AWB is a smokescreen, and we're still at risk. Here's why. (xpost /r/Firearms)",SergeantTibbs,117,19,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/17axgl/feinsteins_awb_is_a_smokescreen_and_were_still_at/,"The thoughts contained below are mine. I don't believe we're out of the woods by a long shot, just because Feinstein's bill looks like it'll die an inglorious death. I actually think it's a clever distraction. Here's why:

1. The chances of Feinstein's bill making it out of committee is slim to none. It's too politically toxic, and even if it did pass there's every reason to believe a Supreme Court sympathetic to gun owners would smack it down as being unconstitutional on DC vs. Heller grounds (it's in common use).

2. Feinstein's bill is sucking all the air out of the debate by being the big bad scary thing we have to defeat. It's worth noting some smaller bills focusing on magazine restrictions, ending online ammo sales, and universal background checks, were proposed earlier or basically at the same time as Feinstein's bill.

3. Democrats in insecure seats could get crushed in 2014-16 on gun legislation, like what happened in '94. Reid doesn't want to risk that by letting AWB type laws out of committee.

4. When Feinstein's bill tanks, it will distract people long enough to get the smaller bills out of committee in the shadow of the wreckage. These could be passed as ""reasonable compromise"" in the dead of night on a Friday just before a big holiday weekend.

Joe Biden gave the game away when he acknowledged that ""assault weapons"" aren't responsible for the majority of gun crime. If this whole thing was really about banning modern sporting rifles, that's where the pressure likely would be, but it's not. They know the AWB will die, and Reid might not even let it get that far.

Here's the worst part: the smaller bills aren't enough to warrant tossing out Republicans in secure seats in favor of more gun-friendly candidates, and their votes can be glossed over by repeating that they helped kill Feinstein's bill. Democrats in insecure seats didn't do enough to damage gun rights to make Democrats in gun-friendly states primary their own candidates, thus risking Republican takeover.

So since Republicans won't throw out mostly gun friendly but duplicitous Republican senators, and Democrats are too at-risk of losing the slim Senate majority to primary their own candidates on something like the gun issue, it doesn't matter if Feinstein's bill goes down in flames. It's just a distraction for the other smaller bills they're actually going for.

Republicans get to say they killed the big bad AWB, and Democrats get the compromise legislation without causing a big enough stink to get tossed out. Hell, even the NRA gets a bone. They killed the AWB, took down Feinstein, and secured memberships and donations for years. They even get more nasty DemocRat strawmen to fight for another decade and raise money to defeat (ineffectually I might add, the NRA-supported candidates got hosed).

Everybody wins, except for gun rights supporters.

And hey, if the laws get torn down by the SCOTUS, well then fine. But if one conservative justice takes a dirt nap or retires, it'll be liberals in the majority and gun-rights legislation won't reach the court for years. The small bills could last for quite a long time... at least long enough for another exploitable tragedy.

I have a story to tell all of you which I hope may help you understand why we have not resisted.

The searches in Watertown happened to happen on a very important anniversary for our country. Most people if asked will probably tell you that the Revolutionary War began on July 4th, 1776. They are wrong and it is truly unfortunate that we are forgetting our origins and the men whom fought for our Liberty.

--------------------------

The Revolutionary War really began on April 19th, 1775 when General Thomas Gage sent the Regulars on a secret mission to confiscate powder from Concord and possibly arrest Samuel Adams and John Hancock in Lexington. The orders given to Colonel Smith that morning were explicit but were to be kept in the greatest of secrecy.

Unfortunately for the Regulars the plan was leaked. Paul Revere learned of the details at a meeting with Dr. Joseph Warren on the evening of the 18th and along with two other men set out to alert the countryside to the threat that they were facing. General Gage, in preparation for putting his plan in action ordered Boston Neck to be sealed. Just as those orders were making it to the gate William Dawes was leaving Boston carrying the message of alarm.

Paul Revere, first went to talk to Robert Newman a deacon who one of only two people with keys to the Old North Church. He told Newman of the Regulars plans and he was to hang two lanthorns in the steeple to alert the town of Charlestown. Revere then proceeded to a boat he had hidden and was rowed by two friends across the bay to Charlestown past the English 70-gun ship of the line HMS Somerset. Once arriving in Charlestown Revere was loaned a horse and proceeded towards Lexington. He knew most of the leaders amongst the colonists and alerted them during his ride telling them that, ""the Regulars are coming out,"" and telling them of their destination. He certainly did not say, ""The British are coming"" since everyone at the time considered themselves British.

The Regulars were just starting to assemble when Revere and Dawes left Boston. The Royal Navy had earlier in the day launched their longboats to transport the Regulars across the bay to an uninhabited point there called Lechmere Point. General Gage had chosen the location because it was far from any homes on that side of the bay. There was a good reason for that though because it was a swamp which severely hindered the unloading and forming up of the regulars. It took them until 2am to all cross the bay, form up and start on the road to Lexington.

Paul Revere made it to the Clark Parsonage just after midnight to alert Sam Adams and John Hancock that the Regulars had orders to arrest them. After awakening them and as he was telling them of the plan William Dawes showed up. Convinced that Adams and Hancock would leave soon Dawes and Revere continued riding towards Concord.

About a mile outside of Lexington they were caught from behind by another rider. Dr. Samuel Prescott had been visiting with his fiancee that evening and was on his way home to Concord. Later Revere would write that, ""Dr. Prescott was a high son of liberty,"" and after telling him why they were out he immediately agreed to help them spread the alarm.

About half way between Lexington and Concord the three men were captured by a Regular patrol sent out early the previous day to interdict travel on the roads to help keep the knowledge of the Regulars movements secret. As they were herded into a pasture they made a signal amongst themselves and all galloped off in different directions. Dawes escaped but his horse shortly afterwards got his foot caught in a furrow trowing him from his horse which then galloped off alone. Dawes slowly walked back towards Lexington but was done for the night. Dr. Prescott being a country doctor knew all of the back ways and was very familiar with the land and escaped. He was the only one who alerted Concord to what was happening. Paul Revere was recaptured.

Back in Lexington, Captain Jonathan Parker was gathering his militia company. He decided that he needed to verify the report and sent out two scouts to determine if the Regulars were really out.

Once the patrol had recaptured Paul Revere they decided to question him immediately. The officer in charge asked Paul Revere who he was. Revere had no inclination to lie to the Regulars and told them who he was. Revere was a name that was well known to the Regulars as a Whig and a facilitator of the unrest in Massachusetts. Revere then proceeded to tell the officer of his own military's plans which he did not know. Revere also told him that he had alerted the whole countryside until he was captured and that there were 500 militia back in Lexington preparing to meet the column of Regulars. The  officer didn't believe Revere. As luck would have it, just about the time Revere told them of the militia in Lexington a volley of musket fire was heard coming from Lexington. The officer confiscated Reveres horse for one of his seargents and left Revere on the side of the road suddenly believing what Revere had told him. His plan was to alert his own column about the militia in Lexington. Revere then proceeded to walk back to the Clark Parsonage to make sure Adams and Hancock had left.

Captain Parker received relatively quickly news from his first scout that he didn't see anything untoward on the road to Boston. Captain Parker was a cautious man and decided to let his men wait inside while he awaited word from the second scout. He told them to remain close though. The men who lived further from town decided to wait in the tavern. Since, even then, you didn't take a loaded musket into a tavern they had to unload their muskets. There is only one way to unload a musket — by firing it. Since there were a fairly large group of them they decided to fire off a volley before entering the tavern. This was a volley heard by Revere which regained him his freedom.

Colonel Smith, being very disappointed in the progress of his regulars decided to send a few companies out ahead of his column to quick march to Lexington. He put Major Pitcairn in charge of that detachment. Major Pitcairn then put a young Lieutenant Jesse Adair in charge of the Regulars at the very front of the column.

A little before dawn, the second scout reported to Captain Parker that the Regulars were out and were only minutes from the town. The scout had found them when he was on the wrong side of the column and had unable to get around them until he was closer to Lexington. Captain Parker then had his drummer call his men to formation. About 70 militia under Captain Parker assembled on Lexington Green that morning. Captain Parker instructed his men, ""Do not fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war let it begin here.""

Revere made it back to the Clark Parsonage around this time and found Adams and Hancock still there arguing, as only politicians can, about what to do. Revere practically had to shove them into a carriage by himself and force them to leave town. He was told, just as they were leaving that there was a chest of incriminating documents back in the Lexington Meeting house. So, Paul Revere had a new mission. Revere retrieved the chest from the meeting house and dragged the chest with another man through Captain Parkers line of militia just before the Regulars arrived.

Jesse Adair arrived at the fork in the road that formed two sides of Lexington Green and it was just light enough that he could see the militia formed up on the far side of the green. He had a decision to make. The left fork went towards Concord but the right fork led more directly towards the militia. He decided to send his men towards the militia.

Major Pitcairn about halfway back amongst the detachment realized what had happened and redirected the men behind him along the road towards Concord and he himself made his way to ride between the lines of the militia and the Regulars. He was yelling ""Throw down your arms, ye villains, ye rebels, disperse!""

Captain Parker believing that the colonists had made their point ordered his men to disperse but to not lay down their arms. Most of the militia had turned around and were walking towards their homes when a shot rang out! The Regulars, with their adrenalin pumping and ready for a fight, then fired a ragged volley without orders into the backs of the Lexington Militia and then charged with their bayonets.

Paul Revere would later write about the events of the day and said that first shot sounded like a pistol. No one knows who fired that first shot.

Colonel Smith, finally arriving at Lexington, seeing his men killing and looting the town ordered his drummer to sound a call to arms. His men were well trained and started forming up immediately. He was concerned about the morale of his troops though and permitted his men to cheer HUZZAH, HUZZAH, HUZZAH and fire a victory volley. Then for the first time of the day he told his officers what the plans were and that he still intended to carry them out.

There were eight sets of fathers and sons on the field that morning in the Lexington Militia. Five of those sets were separated by death that morning. Jonathan Harrington's house was on the far side of Lexington Green and as he was walking home, with his wife and child watching from a window, he was shot in the back and fell down. He tried to stand but could not and then he proceeded to crawl to his front steps where he died in the arms of his wife.

--------------------------

The colonists that morning knew by opposing the Kings Troops that they were committing Treason against the Crown. If they were caught alone they would be strung up on the nearest tree and hung. Who amongst us today is ready to make that decision that their liberty is more important than their lives.

People have asked why we today put up with events, like what happened in Watertown on April 19th, 2013, which are very similar to what led up to the Revolution. Perhaps we do not have the character of those men. Perhaps we do not have the force of will to resist the illegal acts. But perhaps a much simpler reason is the case: we are just too comfortable and unwilling to risk losing what we have for what we know is right.

Until we find those men of character and strength to stand up for our natural rights our governments will push us as far as they can. They will find those who enjoy ordering people around and put them in charge of dispersing our spirits for as long as they are able. The forum warriors amongst us will rail against the injustice and post our messages of disappointment to no avail.

**You** need to stand up and start doing something. Actions speak louder than words.

What I wrote above is largely derived from [Paul Revere's Ride](http://www.amazon.com/Paul-Reveres-David-Hackett-Fischer/dp/0195098315) by David Hackett Fischer. It is a great book that, unlike most history, reads like a novel and is difficult to put down.

If you wish to hear more of the story but don't want to read the book I would highly recommend that you attend an [Appleseed or Libertyseed](http://appleseedinfo.org). What I wrote out above is what we tell as the First Strike of the match in our storytelling. I am an instructor for the Appleseed Project. Any errors above are mine. I wrote the story from memory.

TL;DR: Read the story, it is important.

Another instance of this was in Gayle Trotter's case, she tells a nonsensical story about a women defending her home with a shotgun during a AR-15 debate, only to get called out by the politician she's speaking to that let her know that it was a shotgun not an AR. There are others that have appeared on TV looking dumb as well such as the guy that was advocating ""Gun Appreciation Day"" on Martin Luther King Day and saying that Martin Luther King would have wanted Blacks to have guns because then slavery would have never happened, how would that happen would they have been issued rifles as they came off the slave ships?
I'm just wondering why can we, who make no money off the issue, debate it so well yet these professionals who's careers revolve around protecting our 2nd Amendment rights just make the debate worse every time they open their mouth and allow stupid verbal diarrhea to tumble out? I just don't understand why these people are in Washington debating this issue instead of somebody who doesn't make a habit of sounding like an idiot?

He told the The Las Vegas Review in an interview released by Huffington Post, “So we are going to pick up some more votes. I may be able to get another Democrat or two. That would get us up to 57. We may only need three additional Republicans.”

According to a Senate source speaking to CNN, the following four Republicans being targeted: Sen. Kelly Ayotte (NH), Sen. Jeff Flake (AZ), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (AK) and Sen. Dean Heller (NV).

“Joe Manchin called me yesterday. He thinks he has a couple more votes. The one senator, Republican Senator from New Hampshire [Kelly Ayotte], has been — wham, man has she been hit hard,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) said in an interview with The Las Vegas Review Journal this past weekend, via an advance portion released to the The Huffington Post. He continued, “She’s the only senator in the northeast to vote against background checks. She went from a hugely positive number in New Hampshire — her negatives now outweigh her positives. She is being hit every place she goes. So we are going to pick up some more votes. I may be able to get another Democrat or two. That would get us up to 57. We may only need three additional Republicans. So we’ll see.”

Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) co-sponsored the background checks bill that has between 85-90% support from the public according to various polls. At least five senators who voted no on the first vote are facing severe backlash, including Republican senators. They are Senators Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Mark Begich (D-AK), Rob Portman (R-OH), and Dean Heller (R-NV). The vote was 54-46, and fell 5 short (6, technically, but Reid’s vote was a procedural vote) of passing.

Dems aren’t naming names, but the Huffington Post reported that a “source close to negotiations” said “that there were two senators who opposed Manchin-Toomey who would flip once minor, superficial changes were made to the bill.”

There were four red state Senate Dems who voted no, Sens. Pryor, Baucus, Begich, and Heitkamp. Four Republicans joined the majority of Democrats in opposing the NRA with Republican Senators Collins, Kirk, McCain, and Toomey voting for the bill. Red state Democrat Mary Landrieu took the risk to vote her conscience in spite of the political risk, voting yes on the bill.

According to a Senate source speaking to CNN , Senator Manchin is targeting four Republicans: Sen. Kelly Ayotte (NH), Sen. Jeff Flake (AZ), Sen. Lisa Murkowski (AK) and Sen. Dean Heller (NV). Basically, these flippers require one sentence to be changed in the bill in order to save face for their previous no vote.

Any bill that passes the Senate still has to work its way to even getting put up for a vote in the dysfunctional Republican House of Representatives, where the NRA has a strong hold over the majority party. A February PPP poll showed that support from the NRA could actually toxic to a candidate. But each step is a step closer to forcing House Republicans to be accountable to the public for their failure to serve the public interest.

Reid did not indicate how the next vote would be presented, but it’s also possible that he will provide political cover to Republicans, whom Toomey blamed for the failure to pass the bill, saying that they were too afraid to appear to be “helping” the President.

I used to be extremely anti-gun; as one would guess. However, I have an open mind and will listen to people who debate respectfully. 

I can't say any one thing changed mind. Penn &amp; Teller's ""Bullshit"" episode did mark a major shift though. I think a lot had to do with being an Obama supporter the first time and finding his policies on Privacy and due process terrifying. I'd rather not get into the politics outside of guns though. 

But I started to see politics are often diversion. For example--Sandy Hook. We can argue 30 vs 20 clips and banning certain rifles all day. But the real issue has almost nothing to do with guns. It is that we have no answer for what goes so wrong with someone that leads them to do such a horrible, unspeakably sick act. But if he had only had handguns, he still could have killed plenty of innocent children. Sadly, he could have killed with knives, a car, and a list of other things too. But while ""mental health"" was mentioned, it always came as an after thought with no real solution. Because it is terrifying to even begin to try to address such an incomprehensibly huge and complicated issue.

Anyways, to return to my point, I just want to say I'm proof that some people can change their minds...no matter how unlikely it may seem. I hope to get a handgun soon--but I live in DC so I need to research a bit about the laws now that the ban was tested in court.

Constantly decrying the ""Libruls"" and ""socialists!!11"" doesn't help us, particularly when we need to make it clear to liberal leaning people that they have an 'out' from the typical mainline of their political parties if they want to stand up for individual gun rights, and won't just be shat on *here* as well as when they open their mouths among more Left communities.

To no small wonder I was discussed into the ground with walls of words, stating that the Zimmerman Defense used only the Self Defense law in order to get acquitted.

That said, my suspicions about the Trevon Martin Case where validated. In most News outlets and now even Celebrities (like Stevie Wonder and others) and Politicians (Bloomberg and others) are calling for the end of these Laws.

...and don't get me started about the Cat Calls decrying RACISM!

It's not about racism...it's about CULTURE differences.

I don't care if someone is white, black, latino or whatever. If you look and act like a hoodlum you are going to be treated like a hoodlum.

My main gripe is this:
People think some specific Laws doesn't apply to them.

Also, some People think that just because they had a bad Childhood they can do what they want.

The main thing is that people have the notion that the Government and Schools are in charge of taking care of your Children...they're NOT.

Responsibility for YOUR actions are squarely on YOU and your Children.

If you attack someone with words, then you defend yourself with words. 

If you hit someone then all bets are off.

If someone hits someone or that person is in danger to be hurt, self defense it warranted, deadly force if necessary. 

Self Defense is not a Right given by Law...it's a basic Human Right!

If someone hits me, I will NOT curl up and hope that I'll survive, I will make SURE that I will come up on top, and if need be go to jail for my right not to be harmed in any way.",,False,,t5_2sumr,1373996563.0,,,True,t3_1ifc5s,http://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/1ifc5s/zimmerman_acquitted_but_the_various_states_stand/,

Feel free to AMA.,Travesura,75,9,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/1aix3g/there_is_another_side_to_all_the_weeping_and/,"I live in Colorado. My wife ran off to California. She emailed me a list of demands stating that she would file for a protective order if I did not agree to everything she wanted.

I replied with one simple sentence: ""Please stop bothering me.""

My answer scared her so much that she filed for a Domestic Violence Restraining Order. She did not allege any violence or threats, but claimed that she was terrified of what I might do, citing my ""Please stop bothering me."" statement as a threat.

She was granted the order and I received an **order** from California to surrender my guns. I traveled to California to contest the DVRO . She didn't show up for the hearing, and the Judge was completely unsympathetic toward me, and would not even read my response. He did not dismiss the Order, but simply erased it from the record, freeing her up to file for another, which she did as soon as I left.

I went back in the courthouse, sort of wandering around trying to figure out what to do. and the Bailiff saw me in the hall, and told me that my wife was in the courtroom petitioning for another order. She was claiming that she was too frightened to enter the courtroom while I was there.


Well, this annoyed the Judge enough that he actually read my response, and learned that her petition didn't even allege any violence or threats. So he finally dismissed it.

True story.

BTW, I was able to show the Judge written threats by my wife to kill herself and my son. He didn't care.


TL;DR Court granted restraining order and ordered me to surrender my guns without even any allegation, let alone evidence of domestic violence.

In the weeks ahead, as the effort to create policy intended to keep us safer is embarked upon, I implore you to also consider our past policies and the oft-overlooked consequences of laws which provide a false sense of security that subtly undermine the rights of the American people.

There has been speculation that a renewal of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban would be entertained as an option of ""meaningful action"". We cannot ignore the studies performed by the CDC[1], the Department of Justice National Institute of Justice[2], or the University of Pennsylvania[3] that were unable to prove the laws enacted over the 10-year period did anything to help curb gun violence. Some of these studies even suggest that a reimplementation would produce little to no measurable reduction in violent crime. To re-enact similar laws that have no meaningful benefit to society shows at best a disregard of empirical evidence and a tendency to implement knee-jerk legislation, and at worst a desire to dictate what your constituents do or do not ""need"", regardless of concrete evidence that the item at hand is a clear and present danger to society.

As a nation, we must be absolute in our resolve to strictly define the circumstances under which our rights can be restricted. Our litmus test for the First Amendment was adopted by the US Supreme Court in 1969 and is known as ""imminent lawless action"". This gives the State the ability to restrict an individual’s First Amendment rights if failing to do so would produce imminent lawless action.

The data that would support the notion that a new Assault Weapons Ban or further gun control measures would circumvent an ""imminent lawless action"" simply does not exist. In fact, data showing the opposite effect, that more restrictive gun control laws make it easier for law-abiding citizens to become victims of violent crimes, is available in abundance.

I respectfully request that you consider these points while investigating the appropriate response to the tragedy in Connecticut. My prayers are with you during this difficult time.

Just last month, the New York Legislature enacted an all-out assault on law-abiding gun owners and New Mexico could be poised to follow their lead, unless state Representatives and Senators hear from you TODAY! 

House Bill 402, introduced by state Representative Stephen Easley (D-Eldorado), bans the future possession and transport of a so-called ""assault weapon"" or ""large-capacity ammunition-feeding devices."" All such property owned in New Mexico prior to July 1, 2013 would be grandfathered, but the burden of proving ownership prior to that date is placed on the owner. Proving the date of purchase can be almost impossible and serial numbers do not exist on many magazines.

Ownership of the affected firearms and magazines could not be transferred AT ALL. The only means of disposing of them would be through a gun ""buyback"" or turn-in program to law enforcement -- no inheritance, no allowing a friend or relative to take custody of the prohibited property, no selling or transferring the property out-of-state or even to a federally-licensed dealer. Grandfathered owners of the firearms described below would be required to store them in a locked gun safe at all times except when the guns are being transported or used. Transport would only be lawful if the firearm is unloaded, any detachable magazine is removed and the gun is equipped with a triggerlock.

The definition of ""assault weapon"" in HB 402 is an unmitigated disaster. It doesn't list specifically-banned models and instead imposes a ""one-feature test"" for rifles, shotguns and pistols, as well as a catch-all for ""a semi-automatic version of an automatic rifle, shotgun or firearm."" A banned feature for both semi-automatic rifles that can accept a detachable magazine and semi-automatic shotguns would be a ""secondhand grip"" OR a ""protruding grip that can be held by the non-trigger hand."" Of course, ALL rifles and shotguns feature some sort of secondary gripping surface, as by definition they are designed or made to be fired from the shoulder and gripped with two hands. So HB 402 could essentially ban ALL semi-automatic rifles that can accept a detachable magazine and ALL semi-automatic shotguns, unless they fit into one of the very narrow exemptions in this bill.

HB 402 also bans ammunition feeding devices with a capacity to accept more than ten rounds of ammunition or that contain more than seven rounds of ammunition. This is just one example of how poorly-drafted this bill is in a rush to follow New York’s lead (where gun control advocates sought to reduce the existing ten round state limit.) Additionally, HB 402 includes prohibitions on items specifically excluded in even the most far-reaching bans we've seen to-date: full ten-round magazines routinely used for competition and feeding devices that are curios or relics!

This is one of the worst gun control bills filed in the entire country. It must be stopped, and that can only happen if you make your opposition clear to state lawmakers before this measure gets any traction or momentum.

HB 402 has been referred to the House Consumer &amp; Public Affairs Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. At this time, it has not yet been scheduled for a hearing, but that could happen very soon. Please contact members of the House committees below, your own state lawmakers and Governor Susana Martinez, and urge them to help defeat the worst gun bill ever in New Mexico.

March 1st, 2013

Back in 1990, when I was deployed in Desert Shield and Desert Storm as a Marine grunt, some companies prioritized me items for my M16 for shipping that I purchased with my own funds. After getting out and forming Magpul in 1999, I established the same priority policy for Military and Law Enforcement, due to the requirements of their profession.

The same policy has been in place for 13 years now and has never been an issue until a few days ago. I do not support the idea that individual police officers should be punished for the actions of their elected officials. That said, I understand the concerns that some have with Law Enforcement officers getting special treatment while at the same time denouncing second amendment rights to another citizen in the same state.

With the fight in Colorado right now we do not have time to implement a new program, so I have suspended all LE sales to ban states until we can implement a system wherein any Law Enforcement Officer buying for duty use will have to promise to uphold their oath to the US Constitution - specifically the second and fourteenth amendments - as it applies to all citizens.

1355721923.0,57,self.gunpolitics,14za8s,"Why we have the 2nd Amendment: to take back our government if democratic processes fail. This argument is often attacked as ""silly"" and preposterous as the U.S. has such a powerful military. Here is why that argument still stands.",OHhokie1,72,15,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/14za8s/why_we_have_the_2nd_amendment_to_take_back_our/,"First, it is of course highly unlikely that full-scale revolt will ever be necessary in America. However, it could also be argued that one reason that such a revolt is so unlikely is that any hypothetical tyrant would have to realize that he would face armed opposition. 

There are roughly 80 million gun owners in America with 250 million guns. 

The largest standing army in the entire world is China's, with 2,285,000 active and 4,585,000 total (including reserves).

America's army is 1,458,219 active and 2,927,754 total. [Source for America/China armies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel)

The common argument, ""But what is an AR-15 going to do against a tank?"" is incredibly short-sighted and stupid. This is America, the same country that a hypothetical tyrant here is wanting to rule over, this is not some desert in Iraq. You cannot seriously plan on bombing neighborhoods and cities and not expect the following: factions of your own military abandoning and switching sides, the entire economy to be brought to its knees, and more otherwise apathetic civilians joining the revolutionary cause. 

Another common argument is, ""But all the damage in Iraq/Afghanistan was done from IED's, not AK's."" First, that's not entirely true. Second, do you think only Afghanis and Iraqis can make IEDs? I'm sure Americans could as well, if such a situation arose where the need for them was justified. The point is that in a hypothetical revolution, you would want both.

The other thing is, this HAS happened before, in recent history as well, just on a smaller scale. See [The Battle of Athens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Athens_(1946). This sort of small-scale revolt of a town or multiple towns is entirely possible if democratic processes fail.

Oh, and lastly, don't forget when arguing that SCOTUS in D.C. v. Heller DID determine a legitimate purpose of the 2nd Amendment was ""when the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny."" [Source](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf). Also, SCOTUS did find that the 2nd Amendment has NOTHING to do with a well-regulated militia and rather everything to do with the right of the PEOPLE to keep and bear arms [Summary of decision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller#Issues_addressed_by_the_majority).

In short, 80 million Americans is *by far* the largest standing army in the world. If shit ever got bad enough that even a fraction of them were willing to fight their government, it would be the largest guerrilla style war in the history of our planet. Not only that, but it would be fought here, in America. Remember how costly Afghanistan and Iraq have been to take over and occupy, in both money and blood. Now think about how costly taking over *just* Indiana could be, especially when considering the economy and subsequent crash associated with a civil war at home.

Do not be afraid to argue that the 2nd Amendment still protects us from tyranny. The fact is, it does. I'd bet my left nut that any General in the Army would rather invade North Korea than try to protect a tyrant in the White House from armed Americans.

You may say ""well they aren't limiting gun ownership or purchasing"", and you are right, they aren't. The problem lies in the fact that they are trying to tell you how you can and can't use your gun. Which makes sense as we have laws that do this already(assault with a deadly weapon, murder, etc.), but they are putting CCWers in a position that makes *gun use* very risky. This can lead to things someone giving up an advantageous position to retreat at the cost of their life.

So when you say they aren't really controlling guns, well they are in the sense that they are in trying to make it closer and closer to only the state having the authority to shoot people while in commission of a felony or violent crime. Lets not forget that our biggest enemies have openly said they want to monopolize the use of force to stop people into the states hands.

What I am trying to say is that once self-defense with a firearm is made practically legally harmful, less and less people will see a need to buy a gun. Gun ownership goes down and next thing you know it becomes more democratically feasible to attack gun rights. Remember most people don't see gun enthusiasm as a legitimate need, only self-defense.

1363356001.0,51,self.gunpolitics,1aclos,xpost from /r/guns - All CT gun owners need to read this!! Every 2nd Amendment supporter should as well.,big_ass_stunts,56,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/1aclos/xpost_from_rguns_all_ct_gun_owners_need_to_read/,"I would like to start by saying that I asked the mods for permission to post this thread because I believe that Connecticut is not getting the attention it deserves through the Official State Politics Thread.  As I am sure most of you know, CT has had its own AWB since the federal AWB expired in 2004.  Our state has some of the most restrictive gun laws in the country and it is only getting worse!  **We need to stand up for our rights now before it is too late.**


If you have not heard of the [CCDL](http://ccdl.us/), I encourage you to look them up and [join](http://ccdl.us/membership).  They operate strictly on donations and membership is free.  They do more for our rights as gun owners in the state of CT then any other organization out there and we need everyone to rally around them.  **On top of that, you need to continue to contact your [representatives](http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/menu/cgafindleg.asp)!**


As of January, 30, 2013, there were [90 bills](http://ctpistolpermitissues.com/) proposed in CT and it is only increasing.
**Back to the main point of my post, [S.B. No. 1076](http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=SB01076&amp;which_year=2013).**  I will give my own quick summary of the bill right here, but I encourage everyone, CT resident or not, to look for themselves:


1.  **Change the extent of the AWB from two features to one**


2.  Current law requires an individual to obtain a permit to purchase/own/carry a pistol.  If an individual doesn't have this pistol permit or a hunting permit, they must wait 2 weeks after passing of a federal background check to bring home a rifle or shotgun.  **Under this bill, a separate permit must be obtained before being able to purchase a rifle or shotgun.  If the application is denied by the local police department, that is that.  No appeal to the Board of Firearms Permit Examiners can be filed**  This permit also has a suitability clause which basically allows them to deny the permit for any reason they feel.  If your local pd doesn't like you, or your neighbor complained that you take your garbage out too early on garbage day, good luck getting a permit.


3.  **No purchasing of ammunition online.** All ammunition coming into the state must physically come through an authorized dealer.


4. **Every individual must register every firearm they own, every year.**  You read that correctly.  Not only that, but you have to show up in person every year to register. Imagine every new firearm you buy, you'd be showing up in person every few months, every year, to register the firearm.  Not only that but **""the department may charge a fee to cover the administrative costs of the registration for each firearm""**.  Also, **if you are denied a registration card, the decision is final.  No appeal is possible and the firearm must be turned over to the proper authorities or it will be seized from your home within 48 hours!**

**Please review this section specifically as IANAL but after reading this I am interpreting it as saying that for     EVERY firearm you must give name, address, fingerprints, more shit then I can list, plus anything else they ""deem necessary""**

**This is the most blatant attempt at firearm confiscation that I have read to date.  I would love to challenge any gun control advocate to read this and tell me this is not designed to eradicate guns by making them not only financially impossible to own by most, but also so hard to comply with that people won't even bother.**


5.  **On top of the pistol and long gun permit, you must obtain a separate ammunition permit to buy ammo for your firearms.**  This ammunition permit would list the calibers of the firearms you have registered under your name, and would restrict you from buying any ammunition not listed on the permit.



**These points are just some of the ones proposed in this Bill!**  We need to stand up now and fight!  There was a public hearing about this bill and a few others today.  The bills discussed can be found [here](http://ccdl.us/component/content/article/38-news/241-public-hearing-on-march-14-2013).  As of the time I am posting this the hearing, which started at 10am this morning, is still going on and can be watched live [here](http://ct-n.com/CTNplayer.asp?livestream=0).  **Lots of incredible people showed up to testify against these bills I mentioned above but the fight is nowhere near over.  It is just beginning!**


On top of all of this, Governor Malloy eluded to the people that showed up at the capital on monday for [Lobby Day](http://ccdl.us/blog/2013/03/06/lobby-day-at-the-capital-monday-3112013) as [""the fringe of the the fringe""](http://www.theday.com/article/20130311/NWS01/130319979/1017).


Sorry for the length of the post but I believe everything I have included is important and I have actually left out a lot in sake of keeping it readable.  Thanks for taking the time to read this and I would love to hear your thoughts and opinions on this and any updates/corrections on what I have posted.  **What I would really love to hear is that you are educating people of the fight we have ahead of us and you are letting our representatives know how you feel regularly!**


Thanks to everyone and happy shooting to all!

""Universal Background Check"" really is ""Universal Backdoor Gun Registration."" This plan must be stopped.
An FFL Dealer can not be forced to do a transaction. FFL dealers take on civil liability with every transfer. FFL dealers want to sell their own guns not enhance private sales. An FFL dealer has the right to refuse to do private transfers.
History demonstrates the danger of Legislation - Registration - Confiscation - Extermination.
Every genocide in modern history has been preceded by gun control including Red China, Nazi Germany, Cambodia, Guatemala, Ottoman Turkey, Uganda, Rwanda, Soviet Union
Universal Background Check would mandate that ALL private gun transfers go though a licensed dealer. This means that every transfer is recorded in the FFL dealer's required bound books. This data could then be compiled either lawfully or unlawfully by the Government or by others with bad intentions. Together we can help stop this by letting politicians know that FFL dealers will not participate in their scheme and consumers will not support FFL dealers who do participate.

Maybe you've seen firsthand how gun violence can rip apart a family and a community.

Or maybe you're concerned by what you see on the news.

Whatever your reason, those in Congress who oppose sensible change need to hear from you: Share your personal story or views on why Congress should act right now to help protect our kids and reduce gun violence.

Your story will inspire others to speak out and show legislators that now is the time.

President Obama said it: ""More than a thousand birthdays, graduations, and anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun"" in just the two months since the tragedy in Newtown.

Each of those families deserves a vote by Congress on commonsense measures to help protect our kids.

But we need to demand it.

It's easy to share your story or point of view:

1. Provide your basic information. (Please note: For your privacy, we'll only publish your city and your first name and last initial.)
2. If you have a photo or video you'd like to share, paste a link into that field. You can paste an Instagram or Twitter link, but cannot upload a photo directly.
3. In the final box, compose your personal story or views about reducing gun violence.
4. After you agree to the submission terms, hit the green ""Tell Your Story"" button. Our staff will review and post your submission.

Please share your story today:

This won't be easy, but if we can save even one life, it'll be worth it.

Banning Assault rifles will not end gun violence, a handgun is just as deadly.  Banning large capacity magazines will not end gun violence,  several small magazines will hold just as many rounds, and they swap out easily and quickly.  Prohibition did not stop alcohol.  The war on drugs has not stopped drugs, in fact it has turned mexico into a literal war zone.  What makes you think background checks will stop a criminal from obtaining a firearm.  You underestimate the tenacity of a criminal.  Bans and regulations put the criminal at an advantage over the law-abiding citizen.  The constitution and indeed the second amendment are inalienable right?  If we begin to pick and choose what parts we want to abide, and which we want to ignore it all falls apart.  The first thing you take away makes the next thing easier.  But then, due process, privacy, transparency in government are already eroding.  Our president tells us that we need to stop gun violence, but he is the most proficient purveyor of gun violence.  Using cowardly drones on targets, and considering innocents killed in the attacks acceptable collateral damage. Starting wars that desensitize the entire world to gun violence, but laying the blame on Hollywood and video games (obviously it's video games, right? prior to them, there was no gun violence?).  People will kill people even if you could destroy every gun in existence.  The pandoras box of guns in existence, is already open.  Stop disarming your citizens, empower them.  We realize you have to do something, you can't let your public think you are doing nothing, but, what you do has to be smart, really smart, not knee-jerk, and not the simple minded solutions you are proposing, and trying to convince us will have an effect.",,False,,t5_2sumr,False,,,True,t3_18uszj,http://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/18uszj/so_john_carson_barackobamacom_emailed_me_about/,

Ms. Newman, the article of the ""My Month with a Gun"" series (posted on Ms. Magazine and then The Daily Beast), probably did not load the 9mm Glock that she carried. 

She makes no mention of loading or unloading the gun, and she doesn't mention selecting, buying or storing ammo. When she buys the gun in part 1, she takes the new gun to a cop to see if it's loaded (it's not, of course - new guns don't come with loaded magazines). 

She mentions leaving the gun in her purse on the counter where her teen son can get it, and leaving the gun on the side of a tennis court, and leaving the gun in a bag on the floor where children are playing. I submit to you: no anti-gun person would do this things with a loaded gun, because anti-gun folks are so terrified of guns that they would never intentionally put a gun where kids could get it. 

For these reasons, I think there should be a movement to demand that Ms. Newman publicy confirm that she loaded the gun and carried it loaded. Until she does, her articles should be dismissed as fraud.

A lot of Center of American Progress didn't seem to be very reliable and all seemed *very* biased. So, more digging. The president and chief executive officer of Center of American Progress worked for both the Clinton and Obama administrations. Weird. More digging. Most of the statistics they provide claim to be ""based on"" the findings from the federal bureau of investigations, the CDC, and..... Wait. It does not seriously fucking say that. I mean all out in the open like that? Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Dafuq?

&gt;Part of it may be that people are realizing that guns are not the cause of the problem and we should look at the fact that we have some of the worst poverty in the 1st world along with the worst access to health care.

Kay Bailey Hutchison about gun control. Haven't heard back from the other Senator or my Rep. 

Dear Friend:
     Thank you for contacting me regarding gun control legislation.  I welcome your thoughts and comments on this issue.  
     While we all support the strongest measures to ensure that guns do not end up in the wrong hands, I believe that one of the most powerful deterrents we have is the consistent, full enforcement of the numerous laws that already address many aspects of the problem.  For instance, there are more than a dozen laws at the state and federal level that deal with the use, carrying, ownership, or trafficking of guns, and we must prosecute without qualification those who violate these laws.  
     Rather than usurping the rights of law-abiding citizens, I believe we should vigorously prosecute those who use guns to commit crimes.  I have worked to enact federal anti-crime legislation that imposes tough minimum sentences on those convicted of using firearms to commit crimes, prevents early parole for violent criminals, and provides federal funds to build new prisons and fund local law enforcement.  I will continue to support legislation that fights crime and upholds our Second Amendment rights.  
     On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court upheld the individual right to keep and bear arms in District of Columbia v. Heller.  I submitted an amicus brief to the Court in support of affirming the District of Columbia's gun ban as unconstitutional, and was joined by 55 Senators, 250 House members, and the Vice President of the United States.  This historic decision will affect gun laws throughout the country that try to unjustly undermine our rights under the Second Amendment.  
    
I appreciate hearing from you, and I hope that you will not hesitate to keep in touch on any issue of concern to you.
 
Sincerely,

You have to keep in mind that the presence of an adequately armed ""average citizen"" (who is actually a good, responsible person) is an important balance of power. Did you know that 40% of the wealth of this country is controlled by the top 1% of the population? Did you ever consider that the 2nd Amendment protects the common public from abuses of powerful people, foreign and domestic? You trust those in power implicitly, but not your neighbor? Have you ever considered the prospect of economic collapse, nuclear war, famine, genocide, or a corporate or military coup in 500 years? 1000 years? Have you ever read Federalist No. 46 by James Madison? Have you ever read about human history and how rife it is with abuses of power of the elite onto the common person? Have you ever seen the photos from concentration camps in Germany and Poland? Did you know that just 4% of gun owners in this country represent a larger force than the entire army of China? Have you ever seen oathkeepers.org or heard from LE or military members about their unwavering support of the Constitution and the people? Do you know how many people have died to protect our Constitutional rights? Have you not seen what is happening in Syria today, what has happened in Iran, Russia, Rwanda, Serbia, Vietnam, and countless other places and times? Have you seen the statistics which clearly show rifles are hardly ever used in violent crimes? 

 

Here I am reasoning (pleading) with you, and I know it seems far fetched and out there, but these are real issues. Please try to see this side of the argument. All I ask is that you acknowledge them as legitimate concerns. You need to demonstrate how restricting magazines will actually help in mass shootings - elaborate on what you think this law will actually DO. I actually am not really arguing in favor of 30+ round mags per se, I just want to point out that this is NOT the real issue and that your mentality can lead to further erosions of our children's rights - they may need them more than we do now. Of course we need to do things which will prevent these tragedies from happening. We need to concentrate on things which will work while paying close attention to the important balance of power - or we might be inviting an eventual tragedy for our children's children's children on a scale our humanity may not even allow us to comprehend. Don't just roll your eyes or dismiss this as tinfoil hat mumbo jumbo because you had the privilege of growing up during the most peaceful and prosperous times and places in human history, either. Monumentally, unfathomably horrible things on scales your mind cannot even comprehend have happened and can still happen when good people (the vast majority) surrender their power. The natural state of things is not peace, liberty, and equality for all - good people have to guard those precious values very very closely. Just please keep this in mind, just please acknowledge this. It pains me to think that many of you don't.

This needs to be squashed...

link to bill: www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/83R/billtext/pdf/HB03773I.pdf#navpanes=0

On Monday, April 29th,  the House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence is taking public testimony on HB 3773 by Rep. Garnet Coleman (D-Houston).

 

HB 3773 is beyond bad and, if  passed, would gut what the press refers to as ""Castle Doctrine"" passed by TSRA and NRA in 2007. 

 

Among the many things wrong with HB 3773, the bill would raise  the mental standard for using deadly force for personal protection from ""reasonably believes"" to the impossible level of ""substantially certain"",  and requires the intended victim be ""unable to safely retreat"". 

 

An assailant pulls a gun or a knife on an intended victim, a CHL for instance,  the intended victim must first consider getting away and second be""substantially certain""  the assailant is serious about using the gun or knife to do them harm. 

 

Probably worse, HB 3773 repeals the ""presumption""  for use of deadly force for every location other than within your home, only within your home would you not be required to retreat first.  If you're on the street or in your vehicle you would be required to try to get away and then, again, be absolutely certain the assailant intends deadly force. 

 

An additional outrageous change would prohibit the use of deadly force to stop a robbery or aggravated robbery .   If the intended victim is stopped on the street by an armed robber;  the victim would need to comply, although an armed CHL.  

 

HB 3773 gives protection to those who would do us harm and puts the rights and the safety of intended victims in question and in jeopardy.

 

These are only a few of the problems with HB 3773 by Rep. Coleman.

 

Please contact members of the House Committee on Criminal Justice and urge them to vote against and stop Rep. Coleman's HB 3773!   Please call their office and/or send email. 

 

Law-abiding Texans Need Your Help!
Session Ends May 27th and pro-gun bills are still in a position to pass!   It's not over until it's over!
Our wish-list is long and includes bills to streamline the CHL process and make the concealed handgun license more accessible, bills to clarify where a licensee may carry, and provide personal safety to all eligible gun owners. 

The NRA lobbyist and I are the Texas Gun Lobby.  We're in the building and in their offices every day.  We don't say it's over until it's over!   

Call TSRA's headquarters to upgrade or renew your membership: 512-615-4200.    

Please don't forget PAC donations.  The election cycle is just around the corner.

Keep the Faith,

1358191512.0,38,self.gunpolitics,16kf2j,Excerpt of transcript from Obama's final press conference; what he said with respect to gun control.,waylander632,42,4,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/16kf2j/excerpt_of_transcript_from_obamas_final_press/,"We have got to create more jobs. We have got to boost the wages of those who have worked. We’ve got to reach for energy independence. We have got to reform our immigration system. We’ve got to give our children the best education possible. And we’ve got to do everything we can to protect them from the horrors of gun violence. 

And let me say, I’m grateful to vice president -- Vice President Biden for his work on this issue of -- of gun violence, and for his proposals which I’m going to be reviewing today and I will address in the next few days and I intend to vigorously pursue. 

With that I am going to take some questions and I am going to start with Julie Pace (ph) of A.P. And I want to congratulate Julie for this new, important job. 

QUESTION: Thank you very much.

OBAMA: Yes?

QUESTION: I wanted to ask about gun violence. Today marks the one-year -- or one-month anniversary of the shooting in Newtown, which seemed to generate some momentum for reinstating the assault weapons ban. But there’s been fresh opposition to that ban from the NRA, and even Harry Reid has said that he questions whether it could pass Congress.

Given that, how hard will you push for an assault weapons ban? And if one cannot pass Congress, whatever measures would need to be included in a broad package in order to curb gun violence successfully?

OBAMA: Well, as I said, the vice president and a number of members of my cabinet went through a very thorough process over the last month, meeting with a lot of stakeholders in this, including the NRA; listened to proposals from all quarters. And they’ve presented me now with a list of sensible, common sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kind of violence we saw at Newtown doesn’t happen again.

I’m going to be meeting with the vice president today. I expect to have a -- a fuller presentation later in the week to give people some specifics about what I think we need to do. My starting point is not to worry about the politics. My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works, what should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that we’re reducing the incidence of gun violence. And I think we can do that in a sensible way that comports with the Second Amendment. And then members of Congress, I think, are going to have to have a debate and examine their own conscience. Because, you know, if in fact -- and I believe this is true -- everybody across party lines was as deeply moved and -- and saddened as I was by what happened in Newtown, then we’re going to have to vote based on what we think is best. We’re going to have to come up with answers that set politics aside. And that’s what I expect Congress to do.

But -- but I -- what you can count on is, is that the things that I’ve said in the past -- the belief that we have to have stronger background checks, that we can do a much better job in terms of keeping these magazine clips with high capacity out of the hands of folks who shouldn’t have them, an assault weapons ban that is meaningful, that those are things I continue to believe make sense.

Will all of them get through this Congress? I don’t know. But what’s uppermost in my mind is making sure that I’m honest with the American people and with members of Congress about what I think will work, what I think is something that will make a difference and -- to repeat what I’ve said earlier -- if there is a step we can take that will save even one child from what happened in Newtown, we should take that step.

QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) 

OBAMA: I’ll present the details later in the week.

...

QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. 

On the issue of guns, given how difficult it will be, some would say, impossible, to get any gun control measure passed through this Congress, what are you willing or able to do using the powers of your presidency to act without Congress? 

And -- and I’d also like to know, what do you make of these long lines we’re seeing at gun shows and gun stores all around the country? I mean, even in Connecticut, applications for guns are up since the shooting in Newtown. 

OBAMA: Well, my understanding is the vice president’s going to provide a range of steps we can take to reduce gun violence. Some of them will require legislation, some of them I can accomplish through executive action. And so I’ll be reviewing those today, and as I said, I’ll speak in more detail to what we’re going to go ahead and propose later in the week.

But I’m confident that there are some steps that we can take that don’t require legislation and that are within my authority as president. And where you get a step that has the opportunity to reduce the possibility of gun violence, then I want to go ahead and take it. 

QUESTION: (inaudible) any idea of what the (inaudible)?

OBAMA: Well, I think, for example, how we are gathering data, for example, on guns that fall into the hands of criminals and how we track that more effectively. There may be some steps that we can take administratively as opposed to through legislation. 

As far as people lining up and purchasing more guns, I think that we’ve seen for some time now that those who oppose any common sense gun control or gun safety measures have a pretty effective way of ginning up fear on the part of gun owners that somehow the federal government’s about to take all your guns away. And, you know, there’s probably an economic element to that. It obviously is good for business, but I think that those of us who look at this problem have repeatedly said that responsible gun owners, people who have a gun for protection, for hunting, for sportsmanship, they don’t have anything to worry about.

OBAMA: The issue here is not whether or not we believe in the Second Amendment. The issue is: Are there some sensible steps that we can take to make sure that somebody like the individual in Newtown can’t walk into a school and gun down a bunch of children in a -- in a shockingly rapid fashion?

And surely we can do something about that. And -- you know, but -- but part of the challenge that, you know, we confront is, is that even the slightest hint of some sensible, responsible legislation in this area fans this notion that somehow here it comes and that everybody’s guns are going to be taken away. It’s unfortunate, but that’s the case, and if you look over the first four years of my administration, we’ve tried to tighten up and enforce some of the laws that were already on the books. But it’d be pretty hard to argue that somehow gun-owners have had their rights infringed.

1358538996.0,38,self.gunpolitics,16u1r2,My Brother's Thoughts on the Gun Debates. Excellent read.,RLLRRR,42,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/16u1r2/my_brothers_thoughts_on_the_gun_debates_excellent/,"Perhaps nowhere else today is there such vitriol and collective disgust as there is in the discussion about gun control. It bothers me to see both sides making collective assumptions about the other. 

As a gun owner who owns an AR-15 pattern rifle I don't believe that Obama is ""coming to take all my guns"", nor would I be terribly concerned if he had such designs in mind. The constitution affords him no such power and the feasibility, cost and logistics of such a campaign in the United States would render it inert anyway.

That said, I do believe that as a nation we should strive to form strong, evidence based policy rather than reacting emotionally through our collective legislative body. In this capacity I oppose any assault weapons ban principally because it is based on a fallacious argument and is rooted firmly in intellectual dishonesty. 

First and foremost, we do not have an epidemic of violence in the United States that needs to be addressed immediately. Violent crime and murder here are at unprecedented low rates. Reporting statistics demonstrate that violent crime and murder are at the lowest rates they have been since the 1960s and 1970s, respectively. 

Second, there is little to no evidence that military pattern rifles like AR-15s and AKs are used in any significant portion of crime in the United States. From a purely statistical standpoint gun-crime here is committed in inner cities by minority youth with cheap handguns for drugs or gangs. Perhaps we should address the cause of this crime rather than the tools with which it is committed? We have a broken education system, a definitive lack of opportunity for impoverished youth, an over-bloated penal system that turns small-time criminals into big-time felons and a failed drug policy that encourages impoverished young men to fight it out in the streets over sales territory. 

Even counting recent mass shootings (which are also exceptionally rare, despite omnipresent media coverage of them) only two have utilized any ""military pattern rifle"" and only in the most recent single shooting was this rifle the primary tool used. Mass shooters are far more likely to seek out whatever tool is readily available to them and use that, and multiple events have demonstrated that they have no problem using mitigated-capacity magazines and reloading multiple times. 

Recent events provide strong evidence that magazine capacity limits don't make anyone safer either. As previously mentioned mass shooters typically reload their firearms multiple times during their assault. The state of New York, which has long held that a 10 round magazine capacity is sufficient, recently reduced the legal magazine capacity in their state to a whopping 7. SO...in effect, significantly limiting the magazine capacity of legally obtained firearms was insufficient, so now let's try to do it a little more? This by the same body that admonishes the NRA for promoting the idea that ""more of the same solves the problem."" 

So how do we keep people from being hurt by violence in this country? We take the hard approach. The one that's based on logic and reason rather than emotion.

First we fix our broken education, economic and penal system (people who bitch about the NRA forget about how much money the private prison system uses to lobby the government) so that REAL opportunity is more lucrative than criminal opportunity. We get real about what crimes we really care about, what we want to enforce and what we don't. 

Finally, if we want to address mass shooters (specifically at schools) we look at a comprehensive policy for keeping people safe. Advances in fire policy, construction of schools with fire retardant materials and retrofitting old schools with fire prevention devices have reduced the number of children killed during school fires to zero. Still no-one says that monthly fire-drills at elementary schools are scary or paranoid. We can get real about physical security. We can implement active shooter policies and drills designed by people who have ACTUALLY been shot at (you know, not school administrators or elected officials). In this plan we should at least discuss the possibility of *gasp* armed security. If it's good enough for banks and casinos it should be good enough for children.

Finally, if there's one thing that Obama said in his recent speech that I agree with it's that we don't benefit from ignorance. We need to take a good-hard look at all of our personal policies and see what we can really do to improve on them. If you don't know much about guns, but you hate them anyway you are ignorant. Get some training. Gain some knowledge, then maybe you can contribute something worthwhile to the discussion.",,False,,t5_2sumr,False,,,True,t3_16u1r2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gunpolitics/comments/16u1r2/my_brothers_thoughts_on_the_gun_debates_excellent/,

I wouldn't consider myself a ""gun nut"", or anything close.  For the most part I'd say I'm very liberal, but the proposed bill by Sen. Feinstein has me worried that we're taking a step in the wrong direction.  

I'll try and break up my points for readability, and be as concise as possible.

- I feel that the states should make their own gun laws.  A school shootout is not a threat to national security.  It should be handled on a local level.  

- 10 rounds is not enough for home defense against multiple attackers.  Most commonly issued police firearms contain more, and they often carry multiple magazines.

- Background checks are a good idea, and I support this idea.  However, I believe that states should be the ones to enforce this.  

- I should be able to pass my firearm down, sell it, or transfer it; regardless of its magazine capacity.

These are the key points of my argument, without getting into convoluted statistical arguments and anecdotal evidence.  I feel that this whole process of getting something in place is being very rushed, and we need to take more time to decide what will really be in the best interest of the people.

By David Zahniser
May 3, 2013, 3:33 p.m.
The Los Angeles City Council voted Friday to prohibit the possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines, despite the threat of a lawsuit from two gun rights organizations.

On an 11-0 vote, the council approved an ordinance that labels the clips a public nuisance and ""an immediate threat to the public health."" Although the state already has a ban on the sale and transfer of high-capacity clips, residents can still legally own them.

Before the vote, council members described the measure as a response to an array of mass shootings, including the massacre of 26 people -- many of them children -- at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December.

“Sadly, we’ve seen too many situations where people are attacking innocent people over and over and over,” said Councilman Dennis Zine, a retired police officer.

Gun rights organizations have warned that they will sue over the law. The Calguns Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group, contends that the ordinance violates the 2nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and is preempted by state law, which allows possession of large capacity magazines.

“It is important to note that the city’s proposal is akin to its previous ban on ‘assault weapons’ -- a ban that was repealed by the City Council in the face of preemption litigation,” said attorney Jason Davis in a letter sent Wednesday on behalf of Calguns and California Assn. of Federal Firearms Licensees Inc., a trade association for gun retailers, manufacturers and collectors.

State law defines a large capacity magazine as one that holds more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The ordinance is aimed at allowing police to confiscate such magazines.

Councilman Paul Krekorian proposed the ammunition law three months ago after looking into issues surrounding the Sandy Hook tragedy.

“If that gunman hadn’t had high capacity magazines, there would have been a better option for some of those children to escape,” he said.
