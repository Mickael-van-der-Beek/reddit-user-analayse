1346957873.0,108,self.keyboards,zgo0n,A Basic Guide To Mechanical Keyboards in Respect to Gaming,Rinx7,127,19,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/zgo0n/a_basic_guide_to_mechanical_keyboards_in_respect/,"I have noticed that a lot of new users have joined lately coming from reddits like /r/buildapc asking for advice on what keyboard to buy. Generally they have been thinking of getting a rubber dome board from a company like Logitech or Razer. Well I have come to help all of you out.

First things first, read the sidebar and find out a bit about mechanical keyboards which are the main focus of this subreddit. This guide is to help those who want a gaming keyboard pick the mechanical that is right for them. First though you should know what to stay away from, most keyboards marketed towards gamers such as Saitek, Logitech, Razer, some keyboards made by Steelseries, and Xarmor along with Xarmor Clones. 

**Mechanical Switches that are good for gaming**:

**Cherry MX Reds:**
Actuation Force - 45g
These are the most popular gaming switch right now they are very light and are linear making them excellent for almost every game.

**Cherry MX Browns:**
Actuation Force -45g
These are a hybrid switch that is good for both typing and playing games. They have a tactile response meaning you will feel a bit of feedback when you push them down.

**Cherry MX Blacks:**
Actuation Force - 60g
These are very stiff keys that are favored over Reds by some people because it is harder to hit the wrong key and have it register. Otherwise the behave about the same as reds and are good in most games and OK for typing. Some people say that they make their hands tired though.

**Chery MX Blues:**
Actuation Force -55g
These switches are rather uncommon in gaming because they are very tactile so they don't work very well in FPS but they do work pretty well for MOBAs and other RTS games.

**List of Recommended Keyboards**

Most mechanical keyboards don't have a whole lot of features like rubber dome keyboards so don't expect super gaming macros or usb and audio ports because most of them won't have them. I have decided I am going to make a list of features that many people seem to want and give them keyboards that fulfill those features. Also there are keyboards that don't have a numbpad and are generally considered more ergonomic and better looking, these are called tenkeyless keyboards. If a keyboard is tenkeyless it will be marked in parenthesis next to its name.

**Backlighting-**

Ducky Shine DK9008S

Ducky Shine Year of the Dragon Edition (Tenkeyless)

Coolermaster Storm Quickfire Pro (Partially Backlit)

Max Keyboard Nighthawk X9 (It may look like an Xarmor but it has reworked internals)

KBT Race (Tenkeyless)

Coolermaster Storm Trigger

Mionix Zibal 60

**Media Keys-**

Das Keyboard Silent

Steelseries 7g

Corsair k60 (Not a full mechanical, I don't really like it much because of this)

Ducky Shine

**USB Hub and Audio-**

Max Keyboard Nighthawk X9 (It may look like an Xarmor but it has reworked internals)

Das Keyboard (No audio jacks)

Steelseries 7G

Coolermaster Storm Trigger (No audio jacks)

Mionix Zibal 60 (No audio jacks)

Thermaltake Meka G1 (No audio jacks)

Thermaltake Meka G-Unit (No audio jacks)

**Macro Keys-**

Coolermaster Storm Trigger

Thermaltake Meka G-Unit

**If you don't need all of these fancy gaming features but do want a solid gaming keyboard-**

Rosewill RK-9000

Filco Majestouch 2

Coolermaster Storm Quickfire Rapid (Tenkeyless)

Leopold Tenkeyless

WASD V1

*************


Please tell me if I have missed any good keyboards in here since I did this from memory mostly and I will add them to the list. I may add links to where you can buy all of these keyboards in the US later. Also if you have had serious problems with a keyboard on the recommended list I will remove it.

*************

**Planned:**
Addition of more keyboards to the recommended section as well as telling what switch types are available on each board next to them.

**************

**Edit History:**

Added a description of Tenkeyless Keyboards and Cherry MX Blues to the switch descriptions.

Added CM Storm Trigger and Macro Keys to recommended keyboards.

Added pictures of each keyswitch and they Duck DK9008S2 to the list as well as greatly improving the formatting

Added a few more keyboards to the list of recommended boards and planned additions section.

Azurphax switch out the old sprite image for us. Thanks! Your browser cache might be a little screwy if it doesn't update for you.

Here’s a quick fix:

    .arrow.up {

    }

    .arrow.upmod {
        background-position: -79px -612px;

So. I love my SteelSeries 6gv2 keyboard. Unfortunately, one night I was tipsy and tipped over a beer directly onto it. I saved it pretty fast but the damage was done. Direct hit too, right on the g-h keys. I swwapped out to a extra keyboard and emailed SteelSeries. Told them I'd spilled beer on it and asked what the best ways to clean it were. They gave me some good tips on pulling the caps and such. I rinsed it with warm water then with 91% alcohol and wrapped it in a towel to dry for 3 nights. No luck, now it works 70% of the time, 100% of the time. So I email SteelSeries back, asking if by chance was there a lifetime warranty on this beast. Sad reply: nope, 1 year. ""But, how close are you to the one year mark, maybe we can fudge it a bit.""
I'm just over the 2 year mark and I don't have a receipt since I won the keyboard in a Starcraft 2 BETA tourney. I tell them thanks for all the help, I really appreciate all your help and will buy SteelSeries again.
A week goes by and I get an email. ""We normally wouldn't do this with the warranty and all but we DO tout that as our sturdiest keyboard and you sound like a pretty hardcore gamer so here's your RMA #, enjoy your new keyboard!""  WHAT?! So stoked and surprised, what great customer service. I just wanted to let people know that these guys went above and beyond for this gamer, I didn't even ask them for a replacement, but they were kind enough to help me out. Thanks SteelSeries!!

TL;DR - SteelSeries rocks and replaced my keyboard out of warranty and without a receipt. Yay!",,False,self,t5_2rm65,False,,,True,t3_wa498,http://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/wa498/steelseries_great_customer_service_story/,

- Photo of Rosewill w/ reds (My Keyboards page)
- Costar vs. Cherry Corp. stabilizers (Main keyboards page)

Would have also added the review I did of my Rosewill, but I already posted it at Geekhack and it is gone now. I will probably re-create it on my site at some point but am too lazy to do it now. :P

Please provide any feedback you can: positive, negative, whatever. If you'd like to see something different or find something confusing please let me know. Thanks in advance and I hope you find the updates helpful.

1. It is an extremely fast and responsive Keyboard, every good as they say it is and you won't be disappointed.
2. I can also touch type and I have no problems actually typing once I have orientation. The problem is that without orientation you'll make mistakes. I found myself questioning how I could fix this and there is only 1 solution, which will put you in a whole new realm of typing - read on!

You will get to the point where you start memorizing where every key is! And I don't mean in its relative position to other keys. I mean boom! You'll get to the point where you start looking for other references not just calculating from your home keys. After 2-3 months of using the DAS ultimate, you'll know exactly where for example the 5 key is based on its position between the F-keys. You'll be able to peck at any 1 particular key with great accuracy. 

I thought I could do this before I got the DAS Ultimate, but I was mistaken, I realized a lot of what I knew was based on relative mapping from home keys. The DAS with enough use will put you in a whole new league of typing. 

Would I recommend it? Absolutely, but take it as a challenge and have some patience because it pays off.

I'm happy to report that our daily subscription numbers are doing very well, and our daily views have nearly tripled in the last two months. With this influx of new members of the community, we have all seen a sharp increase in posts submitted.  

I'm seeing a wide spectrum of posts, ranging from advanced modding to troubleshooting, where to buy something very specific to what to buy as a first board, sales from retailers to private trades, hardware news to personal news, updates on the state of other keyboard forums to updates on our own subreddit, and fun tips to confusing questions.  

What troubles me here so far (as it does in many other subs) is that it appears that many posters are not using the search bar before posting. There have been a vast amount of very similar and often repeated questions.  

I would like to hear from any of you who happen to read this post as to what you like to see already, what you don't like to see, and what you would like to see that you don't. I have been letting the votes make the decisions around here so far and I currently have no plans to change that.  

My hope is that two things happen - one, ideas for new content. There's something missing that you'd like to see - if you make it known here hopefully someone will feel inspired and fill that void. Two, changing the sidebar. I think we have a good bit of information over there, but I think it's time to trim things down considerably - I want the sidebar to be a quick read that lets new users know what we're looking for around here and what we aren't.

&gt;I have been using my Das Keyboard for gaming and business for a year now. I absolutely love it. It has made me a more confident typist. I recommend them to anyone that is looking for a keyboard. I let them try mine, and they're hooked.  

&gt;Now, I just recently bought another Das Keyboard for a new build. I got it out of the packaging and immediately noticed a difference in practically everything....  

&gt;The cord is now thinner and not shielded as well as the previous model  

&gt;The fit and finish is tossed. If you look at the line where the base meets the face of the keyboard it's not straight and it's poorly fitted  

&gt;THE KEYS DON'T FEEL A SINGLE THING LIKE MY PREVIOUS MODEL. The space bar feels like there is a dead rodent under it. When I type with it I feel like I am missing things and constantly have to second guys myself. My confidence is lost.  

&gt;IT'S MADE IN CHINA. Whereas my keyboard that I am currently typing on is made in Taiwan.  

&gt;At first I considered simply returning my keyboard and buying a SteelSeries. But then I remembered how much I love my other DasK. I figured I would give you guys some feedback, negative or not.  

&gt;I honestly don't know what to expect from emailing you guys. But I just want my old keyboard back.

Greetings,
I am a StarCraft II player and eSports enthusiast. I believe that Unicomp has the greatest keyboards in production. Being a child of the 80's I grew up with those great buckling spring keyboards big blue used to make and I understand you folks own the intellectual property to the key switches and the keyboard design.


Here is my proposal:


I think Unicomp should start sponsoring eSports, not necessarily by throwing money at teams or players, but giving them your wonderful keyboards. In my honest opinion there is no better way to get your companies name out there then to give it to the most demanding of users (Pro Gamers). If you give them keyboards and ask them to stream with your logo for a couple weeks as a stipulation of receiving the gift of buckling springs, I am certain they would do so; and with players like Steven Bonnell II (qxgDestiny) where he has anywhere from 2k-8k of viewers watching his stream, you would win in advertising by only investing in a single keyboard. Of course there are other players and teams that you could do what ever kinda sponsoring or agreements with, but there are a few companies that are giving away trashy keyboards to players that they charge $120+ for. This is totally not cool in my eyes as there is no substitute for the legacy that big blue left us, and that you now create.

Mike, thanks for the kind words about our keyboards. 
We have spent a little time talking about the gaming keyboard market relative to our keyboards and currently we believe our products are not not well suited for gaming. The biggest drawback, but not the only one, is the fact that our keyboards only guarantee 2 key rollover where the desire for gamers, in general, is n key rollover. 2 key rollover is fine for the office environment and general computing but it is our belief that many gamers would be dissatisfied with our current design point. A wireless solution would be another nice-to-have. 
If you don't mind, I would like to keep your offer on file and if/when we come out with a competitive gaming keyboard, I may come back to you to discuss your offer.

Best regards,

Don Bowman

I've been on both this sub and r/mechanicalkeyboard for quite sometime and after a lot of research I decided to look into actually trying out a keyboard with blues, and a keyboard with reds.

I plan on building my own PC soon so I figured I'd finally look into getting myself a mechanical keyboard to go with it.

I type a lot, more than I game and I found that I prefer the tactile and audio feedback of the Cherry MX Blues but felt like if I were to be gaming for extended periods of time they wouldn't be the ideal switches to have. With the reds, they felt like something I could use more often when I game, but I really dislike the lack of tactile feedback reds have.

I spend more time on the internet and typing than I do gaming, or playing any game that requires extensive keyboard use so I assumed that blue would be the best way to go. But I've been wondering, would it just be better if I opted for red, for those times when I do pick up a new game and play for a couple of months? This has me feeling completely indecisive and I'm not sure where to go from here. A friend suggested I get a keyboard with blues and down the road get one with reds so I have the option to switch between the two but that seems like too much.

**TL;DR:** I type more than I game, but when I do game it's for months at a time. I Tried out keyboard with Cherry MX Blues (love the sound and tactile feedback), then one with Cherry MX Red (good sounds feedback, sad with the lack of tactile feedback) and I'm not sure which of the two would ultimately serve me best.

I have some problems with my fingers, when I type too much. I've had this issue for years - when I use the keyboard too much, my fingers get very sore. This is isn't good, because I pretty much spend all day every day typing. I'm a home-row typer (around 100wpm or so on a good day.) I've also noticed that my mouse-clicking fingers get sore when I mouse too much too. (I have a [Logitech Anywhere Mouse MX](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/notebook-products/mice/anywhere-mouse-mx).)

I write a lot of code, so voice recognition software doesn't work well for me. I'm also an emacs user, so I hit a lot of CTRL, Shift and Alt-key combos.

What I've noticed is that I've when I work on my Thinkpad keyboard ([W500](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Lenovo-Thinkpad-W500-Notebook.11683.0.html)), the keyboard aggravates my fingers less, and the trackpoint mouse is better for me too. (Also it's nice because I don't have to move my hands to mouse.)

I think my problem is gets worse when I have to press the keys harder, I think I like light-touch low-travel keys. I have prefer typing on the Thinkpad to my [Kinesis](http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm) and [Microsoft Natural](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-A11-00337-Natural-Keyboard-Elite/dp/B0000642RX) because of this.

So my question is, are mechanical keyboards for me? I've read about how the tactile feedback is good for reducing the amount of force you use apply with your fingers.

Or should I stick to Thinkpads, and get something like a [Thinkpad USB keyboard](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/itemdetails/55Y9003/460/60AC6A0372B14F5BA7B12F1FF88E33C7#.UIWFb2_A_-s)?

I've been looking at the [DAS clicky](http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional/) (Cherry MX blue) and [DAS soft](http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional-soft/) (Cherry MX brown). Of these two, I'm not sure which one is better for me. The blue's are supposed to be better for typing, but the actuation force is higher, so I'm not sure which is better for me (if either).

I don't care how loud it is, and I don't care about gaming.

Sorry to bother you guys with my questions, but it's a fair chunk of money for me to invest site unseen, and where I am (Portland, OR) there doesn't seem to be anywhere where I can try out a mechanical keyboard in person.

Do you think I should go for the Thinkpad or a mechanical keyboard? Also, do you have any suggestions for a mouse? (I also use UNIX-style operating systems, so I absolutely need a 3-button mouse.)

Thanks for reading!

What is your budget? up to £100

Are noisy keys viable in your environment? Not an issue

Home country / Language needs? UK/English

What size would you like? Full size, preferably with a keypad but its not essential

Do you need Windows/Apple/Unix compatibility? Just windows

Do you need media/macro keys or volume controls? Macro keys would be great but again not essential

Do you want a backlight? Not essential

My first thought was the corsair vengeance K90 but I read that the cherry red keys are specialised for gaming (particularly FPS games) which might be a little too niche for what I play.

",HoHumLP,14,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/wl5yw/thoughts_on_my_new_mechanical/,"
I've been looking around here for a while and finally made the jump to mechanical at roughly the same time as learning to touch type, as those two seem to go hand in hand.

I ended up buying the quickfire rapid after high ratings from redditors. It cost a fair price where I live - $110. I was a little bit doubtful of whether it was worth the money, but everyone on reddit liked mechanicals, so I went ahead with it

Yesterday I came home to find a parcel sitting on my doorstep. I opened it up to find a sleek box, boldly proclaiming the awesomeness of this keyboard. All good so far, I look inside. There lay an object of beauty. From all the pictures I have seen of it, the grey color always looked weird on it, the logos too obnoxious, and you can never really get a sense of scale, but in the flesh, it all looked perfect, even the logos fitting in. The problems others mentioned, such as the braided USB cable, I had considered a feature.

Despite having measured up roughly what it would look like on my desk, the keyboard was a lot smaller than I anticipated. It fitted in perfectly, after my huge $10 keyboard from the nearest computer shop when my old one died. Up until this point I hadn't really given it a go of typing (I bought the blue switch version), so I was pretty eager to give it a go. 

Semi-apprehensively, I tapped one of the keys, slowly, almost lovingly. CLICK. CLICK CLICK CLICK. The sound was amazing.

Within mere minutes I was up to my previous typing speed and not long after I surpassed it by 10wpm. The clicking sound helped create a rhythm, preventing mistakes.

The tenkeyless shape let my shoulders relax when using it with a mouse - and I didn't have any problems with playing games with a blue switch keyboard. The only problem I encountered was the noise when playing games, but with my laptop steaming along with fans full blast and the sound up, it wasn't much of a problem.

All in all I love my new purchase, I would pay far more than I did as the quality of the keyboard is fantastic, it's rugged, heavy, and as others have put it - feels like it'd be a successful weapon in a zombie invasion. The coating on the case feels nice - smooth, slightly rubberized.

tl;dr: Buy it.

Coming from a thinkpad keyboard i feel the keys are a but smaller and will take time getting used to but once you type the proper way (asdf+jkl;) its really comfortable.

I decided to get the tenkeyless at the last moment and that was really a wise choice - after using the laptop so much  and getting used to the mouse being close it really feels like home. I also got the numeric pad which made the set quite expensive (200 pounds = $315 with shipping from [keyboardco.com](http://www.keyboardco.com/)) for the tenkeyless with a few red keys and numpad but I think it will come in handy for repetitive number inputting and ip's.

Overall very happy and i'm thinking about getting a set of keys to play around with colors :)

Basically this is my first mechanical keyboard so i never tried the different switches, but from reading reviews and guides i think i would like brown or black switches.

My requirements for the keyboard are:

- blacklit 
- Functional buttons (f1, f2, f3, f4) should be as big as the other buttons (i'm now using a keyboard in which the functions keys are really small, which makes it a pain for gaming) and f1, f2, f3, f4 should be separated by the rest(there should be a noticeable space between f4 and f5).
- usb port to plug my mouse.
- It should be moderately silent. 

So i narrowed my search to:
[Logitech g710+](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Mechanical-Keyboard-Tactile-High-Speed/dp/B009C98NPY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365544445&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=logitech+mechanical+keyboard)
and [Max Keyboard Nighthawk-X8](http://www.amazon.com/Max-Keyboard-Nighthawk-X8-Backlit-Mechanical/dp/B007F9354C)

Both seem pretty solid and have the features i want. Anyone who tried both can offer a small comparison? are the +40$ for the Nighthawk wort it?

Before i pull the trigger i would like to know if i should look into any other keyboard.

I have used mechanical boards from Filco, Razer, and Steelseries. I bought this because of a cable to board connection issue that rendered my Filco unusable very often. I was dissapointed because I loved that Filco camo TKL. I then decided to go with WASD, which I had wanted before but they do not yet offer TKL boards. This board is the semi-custom option that WASD offers and I chose Cherry Mx Brown switches, the same that I had on my Filco. 

I feel that the build Quality of WASD is superior to Filco for a few reasons. Most notably, the cable connection problem that the Filco came with, causing me to return after a month. My favorite part of the build of the WASD is the cable. It is wrapped but it is flexible and soft, whereas the filco was stiff. Both come with fairly short cables but the WASD also comes with an extender to fit your needs. 

This keyboard looks and feels fantastic, thank you WASD for the fast shipping and great quality!

Some of my co-workers have been giving the Cherry MX switches glowing reviews.  After doing some reading here's what I'm interested in, in order of importance:

* Prefer $100 or less, maybe up to $140 as a max
* MX Brown, or Blue.  I'm leaning Brown.
* Tenkeyless, I've been using one and I'm use to the mouse being closer.
* Windows Key disable
* NK-rollover (prefer usb, but PS2 is ok)
* Prefer PBT keys included

I mostly play MMO's (currently waiting for GW2) though I want something that types well also. Those are my main requirements.

Right now I'm kind of leaning toward the Ducky 1087 since it's tenkeyless, has a good price, has a windows key disable, NK-rollover on USB, and comes in MX Browns.  As a bonus it comes with a red escape key, which I like.

My reservation is that I keep seeing complaints about the quality on the 1087 series being poor.  Also, it isn't offered (or I can't find it) in the PBT keys.  I think if I could get it in the PBT keys I would be set and I could deal with small quality issues as I'm not (yet) a keyboard snob.

My black Dell AT101W with Black Alps Sliders. Well I let my little brother borrow it for a while and his friend broke the PS2 tip... it has been sitting in my room for a while without any attempt at repairs. Today I tried splicing it to no avail. I am basically just lamenting the loss of the keyboard on a subreddit that I thought might appreciate the gravity of my situation.


A little backstory of the keyboard: I work in my dad's computer store, selling and repairing all kinds of computers.  One day, an older couple brought in a Belk's bag full of old, seemingly useless computer peripherals, asking if we wanted any of them as a donation to our store. My dad said yes, and was planning on donating them to a local charity that gets computers and computer components and builds usable rigs and donates them to less fortunate people in our county.  Well I was just rifling through the bag when suddenly something clicked (literally). I pulled out a black Dell AT101W that had seemingly never been used, the keys weren't even broken in at this point, still very stiff as though the keyboard was brand new. I gave my dad $40 dollars for it even though he thought that I was crazy for wanting to give so much for such a loud keyboard (back when he was programming, everyone hated having such loud keyboard and actually preferred the new rubber membrane boards).  I took it home and was happy interchanging it between my Razer Blackwidow that I had at the time.  I enjoyed the keyboard and eventually broke it in, it was a dream to type on. I know a lot of people in the keyboard community don't like Black Alps Sliders, but once they are broken in I love typing on them.  I let my brother borrow it for a few days so that he could possibly learn of how awesome mechanical keyboards are.  He had a friend over that weekend, and as they were moving some things around in his room, the friend snapped the PS2 inside the port of my brother's motherboard. I thought it would be useless so I just set it to the side and would tap on it just to hear it sometimes.  Well today, I had the idea to take an old PS2 keyboard that we had at the store and cut off it's tip and splice it onto my AT101W. After multiple attempts today, I decided that it was a lost cause and am hereby retiring the keyboard. I felt like I had discovered a piece of technological history when I found it, and today as I am placing it with the rest of my equipment to be recycled tomorrow I feel as though I am retiring the jersey of one of my favorite football players. Rest in Peace, Dell AT101W.


TLDR; Lost a great keyboard to my brother's idiotic friend, probably will never find another keyboard in the same way that I found this one, it had much sentimental value. I love my Das now, but that keyboard was so fun to use. RIP",,False,self,t5_2rm65,False,,,True,t3_owwcx,http://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/owwcx/a_sad_day_in_the_world_of_keyboards/,
1327184523.0,10,self.keyboards,oqpa9,So I emailed Unicomp today.,cpujockey,10,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/oqpa9/so_i_emailed_unicomp_today/,"Greetings,

I am a StarCraft II player and eSports enthusiast. I believe that Unicomp has the greatest keyboards in production. Being a child of the 80's I grew up with those great buckling spring keyboards big blue used to make and I understand you folks own the intellectual property to the key switches and the keyboard design.

Here is my proposal:

I think Unicomp should start sponsoring eSports, not necessarily by throwing money at teams or players, but giving them your wonderful keyboards. In my honest opinion there is no better way to get your companies name out there then to give it to the most demanding of users (Pro Gamers). If you give them keyboards and ask them to stream with your logo for a couple weeks as a stipulation of receiving the gift of buckling springs, I am certain they would do so; and with players like Steven Bonnell II (qxgDestiny) where he has anywhere from 2k-8k of viewers watching his stream, you would win in advertising by only investing in a single keyboard. Of course there are other players and teams that you could do what ever kinda sponsoring or agreements with, but there are a few companies that are giving away trashy keyboards to players that they charge $120+ for. This is totally not cool in my eyes as there is no substitute for the legacy that big blue left us, and that you now create.

A Happy Customer and SC2 Amateur streamer,

Mike F. (iEatJello.388)

So because I also listen to a lot of music, the built-in multimedia keys (back, forward, pause, play, stop, volume control, mute) have been especially useful.

I have used it for the past coupple of week and... well... Lets jump right into the review...

Pros:

* Media keys, this was big for me because I like to listen to music while playing games and if I tab out I would end up getting shot in the face while I was changing the song.

* Sleep button, Makes it easier to put my computer to sleep (I no longer have to go into the start menu to put it to sleep).

* I LOVE THE FEEL, click click click click.

* My words per minute has gone up from ~50 to ~90, not that it is a big deal.

* Price, with the 15% off it came out to be 59.99, and this is cheap compared to other mechanical keyboards.

* Remapping keys, every single key can be remapped to be/do almost anything.

Cons:

* LOUD AS F*%&amp;, If you buy this keyboard... add earplugs to your cart. I knew that it was going to be loud... but not this loud. It is not that bad for me because I usually have my headphones on, but my parents and brother think it is the most annoying thing in the world.

* The glossy piano black finish, This just begs for fingerprints although it is not that bad.

To get to the point, I love RTS games, on a competitive level, so I'd like that advantage of having a good keyboard. I'll play an fps game, but for fun really not on any sort of serious level. I know buying a good keyboard doesn't make you amazing at games or anything, but i'm looking for something that would playing my games more comfortable.

I honestly just know the basic stuff a keyboard should have, anti ghosting and fast response rate, i believe, correct me if i'm wrong lol. But I am sure you guys can bring my knowledge to a whole new level and guide me to a keyboard for me, because all of this mx brown or mx blue switches have me completely lost.

This is just the keyboard i've been looking at, it seems to be for a decent price, looks nice, has the anti ghosting, but i am not sure if that only applies to the WASD keys, but anyways if anyone could lend me some guidance that would be greatly appreciated, thanks guys.

TL;DR- I have no knowledge of keyboards other than the basics when it comes to a keyboard made for gaming, so lend me some of your knowledge to help me make a decision! I'm looking for something that will interest someone who plays RTS(or Action RTS) games mainly but would also work for an casual FPS.",,False,self,t5_2rm65,False,,,True,t3_zsvan,http://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/zsvan/gaming_keyboard_recommendations/,

However, the key placement seems to be a little off.

I'm in the UK, and as such use that layout, and the keyboard I bought is the UK version; but the ` and # keys seem to have been switched around (as in, press one and it makes the other symbol).

I realise the 'solution' to this is to just switch the keys around, so I thought I'd check with those more experienced about the best way of 'pulling' the keys off to prevent any damage.

I'm also curious to find out if this layout was by design (and if so, why) or an error, just as a matter of interest. For example, I know the question mark key is in a non-standard place intentionally.

Basically, I need a good keyboard. It will be used for gaming mostly, a bit of typing. Right now I have a horrid one I got for free through my job.

Looking on Newegg, they have these two on sale right now:

and

http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823816001


Pros of each:

G510: 

- backlit
- programmable
- that screen thing
- cheaper (albeit refurbished)

Corsair:

- Mechanical
- Wrist rest
- those fancy red keys


So pretty much, which one? Is mechanical that important? The keyboard I'm used to typing on the most is the one on my Macbook Pro, that kinda rubber-dome flat style.

Home country: US

Size: Full keyboard w/ numpad.

Compatibility: Windows 7

Media/macro/volume keys: Media would be a HUGE plus, although not 100% necessary. I don't want macro keys at all. Volume keys would be nice too.

Keys simultaneously: The best I can get for my price range.

Key type: cylindrical.

Wireless: No.

Numpad: Yes.

Backlight: Don't care.

Etched/engraved or dye sublimated keycaps: Don't know what this means.

I'm using it for mostly typing/schoolwork and games on the side (MOBA/RTS/FPS). I want the key presses to be somewhat deep. I went to my local best buy to try out all the different type of switches but they only had Razer Blackwidows and Blackwidow Ultimates. I think those were blue switches?

Just got these in today. I've been doing ridiculous amounts of research and decided to wait for a WASD keyboard v2. I dont know anyone with a mechanical keyboard and havent used one since elementary/middle school, but I know it's what I want.

Rather than go by suggestions of the internet, I decided to buy 1 of each type of CherryMX switch they offer, with 1 of each type of textured key, to see what they really feel like and decide what I might want. From left to right: Blue dot grid key, row 1, blue switch; yellow crosshatch key, row 2, brown switch; red horizontal lined key, row 3, red switch; green radial key, row 4, black switch.

So far, I really like the blue switch. I imagine this would be obnoxious for anyone else in the room, but I'm not too worried about that if my fingers prefer it. The brown switch feels very nice as well, while also quieter. I dont care too much for the red and black ones, though probably because I'm expecting the tactile feedback. As expected, the black is a bit stiffer than the red, though neither feel too different from each other; and both very similar to my G15.

I'm curious how it would feel to have a blue switch equipped keyboard, but have WAS and D all be brown instead. I doubt it would be worth it and may be annoying overall or eventually to have two different switch types like that.

As far as the keys, the two I assumed I would like the most do both turn out to be my preference: the dots and crosshatch. The horizontal lines feel nice/okay, but the radial I dont care for at all.",,False,self,t5_2rm65,False,,,True,t3_z4ldr,http://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/z4ldr/wasd_textured_keys_in_4_colors_mini_review_x_post/,

Jumped in head first and decided to get the Filco I've wanted for a couple months now.  Purchased it from KeyboardCoUK on Amazon and it was at my door step the NEXT day with the Prime free trial offer, pretty crazy right?

As an avid PC gamer for 5+ years I was enthralled when I first heard about mechanical keyboards recently.  I don't get to game all that much anymore so I'll be using this beauty for typing nearly 90% of the time.  MX-Blues sound like heaven in this thing, I can't stop typing and finding reasons to type.  I'll upload an audio file after I give it a few more weeks to brake in.

I will spare you guys a boring review, you know the deal, Filco makes top tier products and I'm just happy to be able to own something of this quality.  Pictures can't do this keyboard justice, especially the contrast between the lavender WASD keys and the yellow.  The weight was even heavier then I expected it really feels like a machine.  

Its only taken me three days to fully adjust to the Filco and my typing speed and accuracy have improved greatly.  I really can't wait to own this thing for years to come!

* Good for programming (So lot's of typing)
* Laptop style (I believe the term is 'low-profile' or  'scissor-switch')
* Is wireless or bluetooth
* Full size (meaning, includes numberpad)
* Backlit is not required but would be awesome to have
* Keys spaced **not** too far apart

Here a some keyboards I've tried and my opinions on them:

* I tried an Acer that looks similar to [this](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/acer-keyboard-lckbd0a014), but it was full, included the numpad. But it just felt like the keys were a bit wide for me. I'm so used to typing on a laptop, so the keys are understandably much closer.

* The Logitech k800 sounds like it's the perfect one, but I've tried typing on the demos at retail stores and the keys felt a bit mushy. They just didn't click like the way I want them to (very quiet though!).

* The *almost* perfect one for me was the Logitech k750, I thought that it's keys would feel too far apart just like the Acer, but when I tried them, it felt fine. I say *almost* because it doesn't have backlit.

Again, backlit is not absolutely necessary but a great plus for me. Anyone recommend other keyboards that fits my criteria? If not I might just go and get the k750, unless this community has a negative opinion about it. 

Also, the price range I see on this is around $40-$60. Think that it could be lower? If so, how low?",,False,self,t5_2rm65,False,,,True,t3_1f8erc,http://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/1f8erc/looking_for_a_very_specific_keyboard_can_you_help/,

It must be:

1. MX Brown switches. I've tried my friend's MX Red switches and found that I made quite a few accidental keystrokes. I don't want it too be as loud as the MX Blue switches either.

2. Black (or a very very dark grey) colour keyboard and blue backlit. Just a real personal preference as it'll be coordinated with the rest of my peripherals. :)

3. Not terrible aesthetically or ergonomically.

Optional:

1. Programmable macro keys

2. USB ports

3. Braided cable

I've read several rather long posts about different switch types, key shapes, and other such specs and have it narrowed down to three different keyboards. 

I have it down to these three:

[Corsair Vengeance K90](http://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Vengeance-Performance-Mechanical-CH-9000003-NA/dp/B005QUQP94/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357267905&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=corsair+mechanical+keyboard)

[XARMOR-U9BL](http://www.amazon.com/XARMOR-U9BL-Backlit-Keyboard-Illuminated-Mechanical/dp/B003XQE040/)

[Das Keyboard Model S](http://www.amazon.com/Das-Keyboard-Model-Ultimate-Mechanical/dp/B003F7WXTG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357269610&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Model+S+Ultimate+Keyboard)

I know each of these is slightly different than the other, but I think I would be happy with any of them really. My first choice right now is a tie between the XARMOR and the Corsair. I really enjoy the effort that seems to have been put into the XARMOR (one LED per key really impressed me for some reason) and with the Corsair it's the brushed aluminum and ease of cleaning. With the Das it is how clean it is, and also the fact that it is one of the most recommend keyboards on various forums and sites. 

What I'm looking for from you guys is personal experiences, or known problems/flaws with any of these boards? I haven't seen the Vengeance mentioned anywhere in guides I've read and that has me wondering if it's not a low end or bad board?

TL:DR I've narrowed my search down to three keyboards. What are /r/keyboards thoughts on them? 

*EDIT 1* After reading everyone suggestions and thoughts the XARMOR is off the list, and the Corsair and Das are being looked into further. I am also looking into several brands I didn't know about before so hopefully with all this I can come up with something I like.

Does anyone have any experience with these keyboards or can help me out at all? At first I wanted to buy it just because it seemed cool to have a cherry MX green keyboard, but I don't want to make any irrational decisions when I could have better results with red/blue.

This keyboard will be used for both typing and League of Legends, since I typically don't play any other games.

First of all, excuse me if this text is not clear, english is not my main language...

So I'm looking for a mechanical keyboard mostly to play Starcraft2. At fisrt I looked at the Razer Blackwidow Ultimate but i really didn't like the touch... were too ""soft""...

My brother as a Steelseries 6G V2 and he loves that. I was about to test it but I saw people here saying that is not a good keyboard for RTS... So I looked at other keyboards but there is not that much more here. Si I would have to buy it on the Internet wich means that if I don't like it, i can't return it...

So this is it. I don't want to pay a lot more then 100$...

It has a distinct pingy ring to the springs that I don't hear in many Model M videos. The beast is loud. To get a similar sound I had to turn the volume way up until I could clearly hear background hiss.

I don't blame my office mate for wanting me to use a quiet keyboard. 

I was just about to buy an excellent keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches, until I showed someone an example video and they told me it was very loud. All those YouTards hammer the keys like it's a piano, so I expect that I would be a bit quieter.

But I don't know how successful I would be at avoiding bottoming out the keys. That's the trick to being quiet with Cherry Browns. However, I'd have to invest the money before I could know for sure. I don't want to shell out the cash only to find it's *still* too noisy for the office.

So I'm playing it safe and going with the relatively lame Logitech K800. It's got scissor switches which I know will be very quiet. I enjoy laptop keyboards far less than buckling springs (I've never tried Cherry's) but I don't hate them. I'd gladly move to scissor switches to avoid going back to typing into one of those sadistic rubber mats!


EDIT: Well this is embarrasing. My previous keyboard also has scissor switches. I did not know.

I had an old white standard keyboard that felt good at typing at, but it had loud keys that sounded like the Cherry MX blue switches. I had it for around 7 years.

it sounded like this: [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJaxJ0_XMds)

then my old computer died, and along with it, the old keyboard.

Bought a new computer with a new keyboard, a Logitech Deluxe 250 keyboard. Good sound, but the keys didn't felt so good to type on.

5 years later i bought a laptop that had a scissor switched keyboard. Very silent keys, but the keys felt hard and flat.

Now, in 2013, I'm thinking about converting back to a desktop computer, but I struggle to find a keyboard that got a mix between the sound of the logitech, and the light feeling of my old standard white keyboard. it also need to have a Norwegian/swedish/finnish layout with optimally Norwegian keys.

TL;DR: Looking for a full minimalistic mechanical keyboard that doesn't got too loud keys, but also need to feel light to type on. It also need to have a Norwegian/swedish/finnish layout with optimally Norwegian keys ""ÆØÅ""

I saw someone suggested the WASD V1 keyboard:

**Update:**

I'm thinking about buying the Filco Ninja Majestouch-2 TKL with brown MX switches. It will be interesting to type on a keyboard where the letters are placed on the sides instead on the front, and also trying my first mechanical keyboard with brown switches.

After being fed up with my Blackwidow Ultimate, I've got my eys set on a Filco Majestouch 2 Ninja, in tenkeyless. My experience so far is only with the Razer and blue switches. The blue switches were quite nice, but I found them quite loud. Browns seemed like the best choice for me, but on Amazon the price for a Filco in brown switches is higher than the other options. I looked into blacks, and I thought the weight of it may produce the same satisfaction of having a solid key under one's fingers. Both switches are quiet enough for me. I just have a few questions regarding the black switches. Also, tactility doesn't mean much, but I do like it.

1. Are they really that exhausting to type on? I have a pretty hard stroke and I usually bottom out. 

2. Do blacks have a ""pseudo-tactility"" because of the stiffness of the switch? How does the linear nature feel for typing compared to the browns in terms of springiness? 

3. For gaming, if it is exhaustive, are they exhaustive while gaming?

* First ever mechanical keyboard

**Very first impressions out of the box:**

It's heavy.
I picked it out of the box and smiled at how much of a tank It felt like. This thing is the bat-mobile of keyboards. I also use this in an awkward area on my desk such that is rests on a thin piece of plywood (as a sort of cantilever desk-extender), and the extra weight helps the whole piece of wood stay on the desk.

It's tall.
I replaced a wireless logitech keyboard that seems like an apple-slim keyboard compared to this. My hands are still adjusting to getting at a higher altitude to type. This sort of annoys me, but I'll probably buy a wrist rest or somehow elevate my hands to a more comfortable position.



**After some use:**

So far (I've had it for two days) it's been a real pleasure to type on. I've cut through a brief report on it and that was a good 'getting used to period'. I don't know why I went with the ducky over any other, it was probably the fancy LEDs, but I truly like it. The minimal design along with the click of the Cherry blue switches makes it fun to make words.

The blue backlight LEDs set a nice glow to my room when not in use also. (But it's not for looking at!) 

I took a risk getting the blue switches over browns, or any alternative as I heard from countless forums that they were loud. And they are, who knew? I actually love the sound. It makes me feel very productive knowing that I'm slamming out letters and words at pace. (I'm a slow typist, however). The blue switches make it feel as if I am typing on a typewriter. Because I use this in my room on my desk I can safely use it without disturbing people but I would not use this keyboard in a public environment (I obviously speak for the switches.)

Also one thing to note:
They spacebar is slightly squeaky. This was very disappointing coming straight out of the box but I'm told I can fix this by applying some sort of lubricant (that I do not currently own) to the underside of the space-bar. Hopefully in the near future I'll fix this hopefully trivial issue. But so far, this is my only real downside to this keyboard.

I'm not a gamer, and so I bought this keyboard purely for making typing at a desk more enjoyable. I call this an investment and I'm very confident that it will pay off!

I have some additional opinions in my video, and my photos are pretty mediocre.

Yes yes, I know, I should never have bought the Lycosa in the first place. I didn't know that back when I bought it all those years ago!

As for the considerations:

* What is your budget?
**As low as possible without going to the point where it becomes a hassle to use it.**
* Are noisy keys viable in your environment?
**Yes.**
* Home country / Language needs? **UK**
* What size would you like?
**Doesn't matter.**
* Do you need Windows/Apple/Unix compatibility?
**Windows and Unix (as if any keyboard would really have problems?)**
* Do you need media/macro keys or volume controls? (Advanced vs. Simple.)
**Doesn't matter.**
* How many keys do you need to be able to press simultaneously?
**Again, I'm looking for budget here so even if I can only hit three keys at once, I'll survive.**
* Do you have a preference for cylindrical, flat or spherical keys?
**Don't mind**
* Do you want wireless (Bluetooth/RF)?
**Wireless is expensive, so no.**
* Do you want a numpad?
**Don't mind.**
* Do you want a backlight?
**Don't mind**
* Do you want etched/engraved or dye sublimated keycaps?
**Don't mind**

It’s available only in China and there isn’t much good information that I’ve found on the Internet.  I took the risk figuring that if I didn’t like it, I could always find a buyer and then get back on the quest for a decent mechanical wireless keyboard.  So far, it’s a keeper.

There are some pictures up here: http://romly.com/archives/2012/03/neo_zelia.html
These aren’t my pictures, but it looks the same.

**In the Box**

The box included:

1.	Keyboard
2.	Manual – in Chinese only
3.	USB cable – 6ft
4.	White keycap with LED window stamped with “WCG”
5.	Standard keypuller

There are no batteries in the box.  This takes 2 AAAs.

They keyboard looks very nice.  It’s a topless design which seems to make it easy to clean, and it’s unique.

**Wireless**

The wireless is based on RF via a USB fob.  I need more time before I can talk on its reliability, but I do have some first impressions.

First, there is a huge amount of range.  I have a 2500sqft house.  It registered all key presses from every corner of the house across both floors.  I even went another 20 feet into my back yard, and that’s beyond an 8inch thick barrier of foundation concrete, and all of my presses registered.  We’re talking 50 feet to that point.  Beyond that, few of my keypresses registered.

I checked for concurrent key presses.  Shortcuts that require 3 keys at the same time were no problem.  I don’t know any that require 4, so I haven’t tested that.

Within the first few minutes of using this, there was a moment where none of my keypresses were registering, but most came through some seconds later, so I’m sure it was due to my computer.  Since then, it hasn’t lost a single one.  Still, this is something I will be paying close attention to as time goes on, and I’ll update here later on.  I will also include battery life info at that time.

I would also like to check on latency between wired and wireless options.  It’s all instant to me, but I’m sure the gamers in here may be more sensitive to any key lag.  Is there a certain way I could test that?

*Edit: After 2 weeks of use, the wireless stopped working.  I did change up some drivers a bit around that time, and I haven't spent much effort in troubleshooting, so it's possible that it's only software.*

**Convenience Keys**

There are some feature keys on the keyboard that are accessible via a Function key, that is located in place of the right-hand Windows key.  Hold it down and use the F1-6 keys for media controls.  Function-F7 disables the Windows key.  Function-F8 disables the LEDs on the keyboard.
There is a 10key built into your right hand key positions.  Press the Function-NumLock, and this will put into 10key mode.  I don’t believe that there is a way to access the 10key simply by holding down a single key.

There are status LEDs on select keys.  These show the states for Caps, Num, Scroll and Switch Locks.  There is also an LED on the Esc key, which blinks if going out of range.

**Driver**

I first set this up with the wireless USB fob only.  As soon as I plugged it in, the driver installed and all functions were working properly.  When plugging in the USB cable, another driver was installed.  So far, I’ve only tested on Windows 7, but I have Mac and Linux computers I will be testing against later on.

**Durability**

I’ve only used this for a couple hours at time of writing.  I’m leaving this section here for future use.  If you’ve stumbled across this after a couple months from writing and I haven’t updated, please post a comment to remind me.

**Ordering**

This keyboard is not available outside of China, so you may need to order direct.  It is available via Taubau, but if you live in the US, you will need to order from an intermediary that will buy the keyboard for you and then ship it once they receive it.

I used jojbuy.com.  I couldn’t find much good information about this service that wasn’t a self-written PR piece by the company.  It looked legit enough that I figured it was worth the risk.  All went well and I received the package in Colorado, US within 8 days of placing my order.

Their website can be confusing however.  You first have to buy the product.  Once you do this, they will order it.  Once they receive it, they then ask you to make another payment for shipping and they tack on their own handling fee.  There is no guarantee as to what that fee will end up being.  It could have been $1.  It could have been $100.  There was no telling, so this felt like the riskiest part of the purchase.

I ended up paying a first installment of $90.49 for the product.  Then 2 days later I received an email saying that I need to pay for the shipping and handling and they’d send it out immediately after that.  That 2nd payment was for $37.36.  Of that, only $7 was for their handling fee, which I thought was fair.

It took me a few minutes to find where to make that 2nd payment, but poking around in my account area brought it up.

When placing the order, the key type choices aren’t very clear.  Here are the color choices that they list with what they actually mean:

* “neo black hand under the neo golden helmets” - Black
* “tea axis scheduled” - Brown
* “axis” – Unsure, but would guess clear
* “red axis reservation” - Red
* “green axis reservation” – Unsure, but would guess blue

Here’s the link to the product page:

http://www.jojbuy.com/taobao-agent-product-Neohardware-NEO-87-Zelia-competing-God_1120221.htm

The package came in a bit mangled, but I’ve seen worse.  There were a few layers of bubble wrap around the box, and everything was in good condition inside.

The first thing I noticed is that the keyboard legend font looks a lot nicer and ""professional"" than on my old Qpad MK-50. Also the surfaces look smoother as if they had some sort of thin rubber coating.

The blue switches are far more comfortable for typing than reds. The noise might not be for everyone but I tend to listen music with headphones so the noise is not a problem at all. Just don't attempt to use the keyboard when someone is trying to sleep next to you!

Also tenkeylessness is awesome. I can keep the keyboard centered with the monitor and the mouse is much closer to the my hands. The keyboard is still heavy enough to stay in place easily and it's great. (Actually it feels heavier than the full-size MK-50.)

The thin plastic cover that came with it is also useful as my apartment tends to get dusty very fast.

Overall I can only suggest the Filco keyboards. They are a bit pricey but I feel like it was worth it. There are few cons too. The keyboard didn't come with a keycap puller or fancy escape key and there are no dip switches to turn Caps Lock into Ctrl or Esc.

My keyboard model is : Adesso MKB-135B and has Cherry MX Blue keys

My left CTRL has stopped working (I don't really know why, but it might be because of an accidental water spill... well it probably is why)

However all my other keys work perfectly.. I wonder if there is a way to make the Left CTRL key work again! 
As you can imagine, using a computer with the R-CTRL is really, really annoying (think of all the CTRL-A, copy, cut, paste, CTRL shortcuts... etc.)

Of course I'm willing to take it appart to repair it

Just in case.. anyone know a place in Montréal where I could get it repaired?

Currently I'm using a SteelSeries 6Gv2, and while I like it more than a regular keyboard, the black switches aren't really my cup of tea, as they get a little annoying to type on for extended periods of time. 

Now I'm in the market for a new keyboard, but before you say ""get a Filco"" - here's the catch: it needs to be in Scandinavian/Nordic/Danish layout, ISO, and be tenkeyless (preferably, but debatable). I'd show you what it looks like, but apparently they don't have stock photos with that. A good example of how difficult it is to find a keyboard like that, I guess. 

From what I can tell, I prefer MX Blue switches. The tactile feedback seems nice, but Browns might work just fine.

So far, the closest thing I've been able to find that suits my needs perfectly is the Leopold Otaku, but sadly they don't carry Nordic layouts. That is, however, essentially what I want. Another close contender is WASDKeyboards (and the build-it-yourself is cool), but they aren't TKL, and as lame as it sounds, i really don't like the look of them. The base is just all weird. Others I've looked at include the Corsair vengeance-ones, as well as the Quickfire ones.

**TL;DR** A keyboard like Leopold Otaku with blue or brown switches, in Nordic ISO layout for a reasonable price (&lt;150$, ca.)?

Bonus question: the space and enter keys on my 6Gv2 seems to be much ""worse"" (not the right word) than the rest -- is this unavoidable in keyboards because of the size, or do ""better"" keyboards not have this 'problem'?

(Edit: I'm being super picky in an already difficult situation, but if I can't find the thing I want, I might as well stick with what I got for now. I'm just hoping it's out there somewhere!

Any other recommendations?,Bluesroo,6,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/wollh/mechanical_keyboards_are_too_expensive_for_me_any/,"I'm on a strict budget of no more than $35. My current keyboard is a POS that came with a computer my family bought a couple years ago from HP. Loud, thuddish sound and the keys just don't feel good.

I've been looking around a lot for something cheap and quiet. I'm up at night when my family is asleep, and sometimes the keys can be loud. I absolutely love my laptop keyboard (it has scissor switches), but because I'm using an external monitor as my main monitor it can be really annoying to type with my whole body shifted 45 degrees from the screen I'm looking at. It can also feel really weird when gaming to feel like my arms are wide open in order to use my keyboard and mouse.

So there is my problem. I just need a cheap, quiet, and preferably small keyboard (no number pad necessary, but I won't turn a keyboard down with one). No need for wireless. I love the feel of scissor switches, but is there anything I should be wary of?

I'll list some of keyboards I've found, but I just don't know where to look for scissor switch keyboards, or if there are any reputable manufacturers of them.

They both have back lights, macro keys, and wrist wrests.

The differences are that the k90 has 18 macro keys, and 54 programmable macros, while the Trigger only has 5, and I might be needing more then 5. The Trigger has 2 USB pass through's, and the k90 has 1. k90 has 20kro, and the Trigger has 6kro.The biggest difference is, the Trigger is fully mechanical with either red, blue, black, or brown switches, and the k90 is not fully mechanical, and only comes with red switches.

I am not sure was to go wit, I was going to go for the k90, but then I had checked out the Trigger, and now I don't know which one to choose; fully mechanical, or mechanical for mainly used keys, the rest are rubber dome, more features, and perhaps less quality (heard that from another person.)

Which one is the better choice for MMO's, and FPS?

What are some of the features that you'd like to see in a custom board? What is your perfect keyboard?

Some of my initial thoughts:

Obvious start would be NKRO over USB (possible with custom driver/implementation over USB). 

Really dim or frosted LED indicators for *locks.

Basic US layout (non L shaped enter key, includes windows button).

Media keys (FF/RW/Play/Stop/Vol up/down)


Now the unusual stuff:

""Modular"" design. If anyone's ever worked with basic electronic breadboards, the design is ""slotted"" so you can stack a few of them together side by side.
[Pic](http://rocky.digikey.com/weblib/Twin%20Industries/Web%20Photo/TW-E40-1020.jpg)


Something like the above photo, each modular piece would have slots and protruding ""pegs"" to lock together.

Modular pieces would be: Left hand side, Right hand side, 10 key add-on. This would allow flexibility for the user to set the keyboard up in an ergo friendly/split keyboard state (if desired). The keyboard in ""standard"" state would just have the three pieces ""docked"" together to form a very normal layout.

Additional features: USB hub (most likely located in the ""right hand side"" half of the keyboard. USB hub could have additional power jack for powered USB ports (standalone power brick).

Detachable USB cable (probably USB-B)

Audio jacks (with integrated USB DAC/simple headphone Amp). The corny audio cable to sound card method is kind of silly, IMO. This might add some complications for people, as someone might not really want to have to fiddle with an additional audio device in device manager... maybe I'd add an additional 1/8"" TRS that plugs in between the DAC/Headphone amp to have an amped output from sound card...

I'd have an extra slot for a ""mouse cable holder"" (completely optional accessory). Some gamers really like the mouse cable bungie, but I'd probably never use it.

Switches... I'd probably have one of each board, just for funsies :) If I had to choose one, it'd be Cherry Blues, but I'd like a Red/Brown board for work.

Optional: Function button for macros/etc
Cherry wood (for a cherry board).

Edit: to expand on the ""docking"" portion: I haven't thought it all the way through, but obviously each portion of the keyboard would have to connect together to communicate with the controller. I can see MANY many ways to do this (wirelessly/RF/Bluetooth or via USB cable [second integrated hub]. Both solutions would drive costs up (but I'm not really looking to mass produce this, just as a hobby/hack). If anyone has any ideas for this, I'd be interested to hear it. Retracting cable or even an ACTUAL USB doc would be cool, but it'd require much higher tolerances from a case design standpoint. It's not a deal breaker, but it makes things harder to build up.

The only issue right now is choosing the right board. So, I came here for some advice before I do. 

Basically, I want a mechanical keyboard with back-lighting. I know it severely limits my options, but its a feature I don't want to go without. I've spent too many night gaming in the dark wishing I had back-lighting not to invest in it now, especially seeing as I'll be stuck with this board for a long time. Also, I'm in Australia, so it limits me even further.

I'm going to be using it for gaming and long periods of typing (work, assignments etc)

As for switch type, I think I'd like Cherry MX Browns. I could tolerate the Reds, but I'm a bit iffy about MX Blacks, what with the amount of typing I'll be doing; finger fatigue does not sound appealing. I'm not too keen on the excess noise that Blues make. 

Ideally, I'd love a wrist rest (mech's tend to sit a bit higher off the desk than normal ones)

Options:

Ducky Shine - comes in any colour switch, multitude of led colours. I can always get a separate wrist rest. (Leaning more towards this one)

Corsair K90 - MX Reds, wrist rest, blue back-lighting, easy to keep clean but some keys are non mechanical, more expensive, macro keys, 

Minoix Zebal - MX Blacks, green led, wrist rest

Noppoo Pro LED - comes in red LED, MX red/brown. 

Razer Blackwidow - arbitrary mention, but I'd never realistically consider it due to poor build quality.

Also, both enter keys, numpad +, and backspace are worn down to where it feels like there's stuff blocking it from going down.

I admit I used to hit the thing when I got mad but just know that I don't anymore and won't again (please don't dwell on this). BUT, I do have very heavy fingers and it just feels like this keyboard is wearing down because of it. Whenever I type really fast I'll hit most keys, ENTER most of all, quite hard.

I have my eyes on a Corsair Vengeance K70 right now. I just want to know if anyone can tell me if it is  structurally stronger than a Blackwidow. If it isn't I'd welcome any suggestions you guys may have (I'd like to stick to mechanical if possible).

* Has to be wireless. I have one of those sliding shelves under the main desk for my keyboard and mouse, and my experience with wired keyboards is that the cord gets stuck in the sliding mechanism.
* I would prefer it to not be mechanical. The noise is a bit of an issue, as it is in the same physical room as the main tv area (though the opposite end of the house). Also, I've heard that people absolutely hate typing on normal keyboards after using a mechanical, and I do quite a bit of coding and typing at school using their shitty keyboards.
* I'll be using it for gaming primarily, but I don't want a gaming keyboard. Of course I'll also be using it for the standard things a computer does as well, and *some* typing. I don't like the design nor feature-set gaming keyboard have.
* I don't want keys like [this](http://www.logitech.com/en-ca/product/wireless-illuminated-keyboard-k800?crid=26). They are way too flush for my preference, and when I went to the store it just didn't feel right.

Yes, it is a slight ergonomic model, but I don't care too much about that. If a keyboard is ergonomic I'm fine with it, so long as there isn't a difference in height between keys or a split design.

Everything I touch gets fingerprints, including things that have a matte finish. My kindle, laptop, tower case, everything. Fingerprints everywhere and I can't do anything about it.

I used to run with [this keyboard](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823107120), which has your run of the mill matte plastic keys, but my finger goop was really distracting.

I decided I needed an upgrade, so I got the Sidewinder X4. Which I love a lot (these half height keys are perfect for me), and I would love it even more if the fingerprints weren't a problem still. While not as goo-ey as the previous keyboard, even a short period of use coats the keys in annoying sticky fingerprint residue. I wipe it down regularly too.

So I'm looking for a keyboard that can offer me similar features to the Sidewinder X4 (most importantly anti ghosting, media keys, half height keys) **that specifically doesn't pick up fingerprints.** I can't stand them and they get everywhere. For reference, I tried out an old dell mechanical keyboard (basically a model M clone) and it got pretty sticky too, though not as quickly as the Sidewinder x4.

Q/A (questions ripped from similar thread by mikes595, many thanks) 

- What is your budget? Around $120 USD, but I can go up to 170 or there about if need be.

- Are noisy keys viable in your environment? I do not have any problem with loud keys. Quieter keys would be preferable though.

- Home country / Language needs? Nordic/Norwegian QWERTY keyboard.

- What size would you like? Standard size? I have no idea how big of an impact a few centimeters would make really.

- Do you need Windows/Apple/Unix compatibility? Windows 7.

- Do you need media/macro keys or volume controls? Media keys would be nice. Macro keys is fine to, but not needed.

- How many keys do you need to be able to press simultaneously? N-Key rollover is preferable, at least 6 keys as I will use this keyboard for typing and gaming.

- Do you have a preference for cylindrical, flat or spherical keys? I dunno, standard is fine.

- Do you want wireless (Bluetooth/RF)? No wireless please.

- Do you want a numpad? Yeah, I'd like one.

- Do you want a backlight? I'd like a backlight, but it's not necessary. It would be cool, but depends on the price.

- Do you want etched/engraved or dye sublimated keycaps? I want it to last a long time, soo etched?

- If mechanical, what kind of keyswitch do you want? I have only ever tried a Razer BlackWidow with blue switches, so anything as far as I'm conserned.

http://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=leopold,tenkeyless&amp;pid=fc200rtabn

Now, I have a few things I'm taking into account...

1. How does the Das compare to the Otaku? Do they have a similar build quality? Does either feel like a ""weaker"" keyboard?

2. I'm concerned about tenkeyless... I don't use the num-pad often, and the more I think about it, the more I realize that I don't use it that much at all... I like to surf on CS:S and I feel like I'm running my mouse into the side of my keyboard a bunch... Does tenkeyless free up a bunch of space?

3. Do white keyboards/caps get dirty really easily?

That's about all for now... hopefully you guys can help me out. Thanks!

In talking about mechanical keyboards/converting my friend to the mechanical side, I looked a lot at the Ducky Shine and I am extremely intrigued. I'm happy with the Filco right now in terms of typing on it - it's amazing quality, as always with Filco. I couldn't ask for any better when it comes to feel. But Ducky keyboards, from what I have heard, are also top of the line quality, and in looking at the Ducky Shine, I'm thinking I may be happier with the awesome looking LED from it. Especially since it's not going to be crap quality like a Blackwidow or anything.

My real question, I guess, is: Are Filco keyboards WAY AHEAD of Ducky keyboards when it comes to quality and feel? Are they about the same? I don't want to get the Ducky Shine because it's pretty if I'm not going to like typing on it. 

At first I was thinking well hey, I'll just get the Ducky and have both and ""add it to the collection"" I suppose (even though it'll just be 2 keyboards), but a buddy of mine is making a good case for only having one keyboard, for monetary reasons and just because I can't actually use both at the same time. I know people here will probably say get both and have them just to have them, but I wouldn't mind having money back for the Filco.

I recently bought a Leopold FC200R ""Otaku"" with MX Browns. I've been using it for about a week now. The keyboard, since I got it, has not had that clack sound that is characteristic of mechanical keyboards. I bottom out on every keypress, but I feel as though the keyboard has that type of squishy feeling, not as bad as a membrane keyboard but almost. It's definitely not hitting a solid back with a clack like other mechanical keyboards (I've used a Das before). So I have two questions:

I like the idea of the WASD keyboards, frankly because of being able to pick out all the pretty keys.

Little backstory first, relevant information afterwards.

**LITTLE BACKSTORY:** So, I've been, for most of my life, trying to find a good compromise between budget and quality (when it came to computer peripherals), but at one point I went the extra mile and got myself a Logitech G500 mouse, which has been amazing. Looking back on the keyboards I've owned, I had a Logitech something-or-other (I don't know what it's called, but I'm pretty sure it was really popular because I remember seeing it rendered in pixelly goodness in Counter-Strike Source or something) for about 7$, and it lasted basically until I spilled a bottle of water on it (by accident, don't look at me like that). Then, I got some Microsoft keyboard, a ""Digital Media Pro"" keyboard, which I'm still using now (if I had to guess, I've been using it for about three or four years.) It occurred to me that A: good-quality things are nice to use (like the mouse), and B: if you treat a keyboard well, it will last you a long, long time and will absolutely be worth the money.

**RELEVANT INFORMATION:**

 * What is my budget? 
 I'm gonna say the limit is about $150. 
 * Do I need Bluetooth? 
 I have no idea why I would want this, so no. 
 * Do I need wireless? 
 Nope 
 * Do I need Windows/Apple/Unix compatibility? 
 I use Ubuntu(in a VirtualBox) for the programming I'm learning at University and Windows 7 for everything else. 
 * Do I need media/macro keys, and do I need volume controls? (Advanced vs. Simple.) 
 These can be as simple as possible. I don't mind the extra bells and whistles, but I haven't grown reliant on them and I feel I can continue living without them. 
 * Do I want a numpad? 
 It never occurred to me, but I don't use the numpad very often. This can go either way. 
 * Do I need an obscure language layout? 
 I have not touched anything that wasn't QWERTY.
 * Are noisy keys viable in your environment? 
 I'd *like* to avoid them if only to preserve my own sanity. I'm sure I could get used to the noise, and this is for home use so I won't be pissing off co-workers.

**Miscellaneous things:**

 * I do work at my desk and that tends to get things under the keys in my keyboard (i.e. hairs, eraser bits, bits of pencil lead) which I'd like to be able to clean out, so being able to take off the keycaps would be nice. 
 * I live in Canada. That probably limits my options a bit. 
 * If I can replace the keycaps (whether because I like to replace them with something cool-looking or if some key breaks and I want to just replace that one key) that would be A+. 
 * I'm not particularly familiar with the different switches, but from the sound of it, Cherry MX browns/blacks seem the most attractive to me, based on what I'm reading in the geekhack sticky in the sidebar. (Default: START HERE). Blue switches sound like something I'd want to avoid (really light and really noisy, AFAIK) 
 * My current keyboard takes over 70g of force to push a button, and about 30g to keep it pressed (calculations based on nickels, which the sticky says are 5g; this may not be entirely accurate as I'm not sure how the weight of a Canadian nickel compares to an American one). It feels a *little* stiff, like if I took the time to get used to a slightly lighter keyboard, it would be more comfortable. 
 * I do some programming and a lot of PC gaming (Starcraft II, Dota 2, soon some Diablo III and Torchlight II). I do tend to mash the same key with perhaps more force than is necessary in a tight situation, but it's not very important to me to be able to register more than, say, four keys at once. I also like to post on forums and may have to type essays and stuff in the future, but I'm sure I'm limited more by my own fingers than I am by the quality of the keyboard.

So far, the most attractive keyboard I have seen so far is the Das Keyboard Professional Silent model. However, I'm certain there should be more alternatives to consider. Can you folks help offer some insight?
 
**UPDATE:** I bought the Rosewill RK9000-BL and tried it out for the first time today. It's fantastic! At first I thought the switches were a little stiffer and put up a bit more resistance than I'd have liked, but once I started typing it just felt amazing.

Album inside,rednukleus,7,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/qipk5/scored_a_unique_ibm_model_m_for_free_today_album/,"I went hunting at my workplace to find a Model M I might acquire. I found [this beaut](http://imgur.com/a/ZMShJ) propped up between an unused CRT and tower, with the numpad 0 popped off and laying nearby. I asked if I could have it. It has an interesting corporate logo instead of the IBM logo. It has a non-removable coiled cord with a DIN connector, and luckily a PS/2 adapter attached. It has that round slotted hole which I don't understand, and the drainage holes. This isn't one of the real classics with the dual-part keys, but I wasn't expecting to find one of those anyway. The only issue with its functionality is that the left arrow key is much softer and quieter than all the other keys.

I'm nostalgic for the M2, which I had from the mid '90s to the mid '00s. I think it was a bit softer to the touch than this keyboard. The base seemed flimsy like today's keyboards but the tactile feel was so perfect that I never thought about or appreciated how finely tuned it was. I left my M2 at my dad's house when I graduated from college, and it's since been discarded. A house that once was overrun by buckling spring keyboards now contains only membrane keyboards. At the time, I didn't know how good I had it, and thought a quieter keyboard must be better technology. I didn't realize how annoying membrane keyboards are until I began working and using one full-time. I also had no idea how rare/pricey buckling spring keyboards would become. I regret that I didn't hold on to all the Model M's and M2's we used to have lying around everywhere.

**Budget** | ~$100
**Bluetooth?** | No
**Wireless?** | No
**Compatibility?** | Windows, Linux

**Obscure language layout?** | No.
**Noisy keys viable?** | I'm on a Model M, so... yeah.

I disassembled the laptop and got everything dried, and all the damage cleaned up. The issue I am having now is that 6 keys on my laptop keyboard print 2 characters instead of one. IE: pressing ""o"" prints ""op"", pressing ""p"" also prints ""op"", so I can't use any clever scripts to solve this. Also eliminated the idea that it is the laptop keyboard that's broken, by testing another old laptop keyboard I had for this model (I'm abusive to my keyboards). I can't seem to fix the motherboard issue, so I've given up hope on making the current keyboard work.

So, I am looking for a replacement USB keyboard that I could easily use with a laptop. Preferably I'd like to find a laptop keyboard with a USB interface that I could mount in place of my old broken keyboard. I have plenty of electronics experience, so I feel confident in tackling things that would require assembly.

Barring that, a usb keyboard that is slim and could easily be transported is the next best option.

Any recommendations are appreciated.

So my dad has pretty bad arthritis in his thumb and pain in his palm. His current keyboard, a crappy ""ergonomic"" rubber dome Microsoft board, is awful for typing and I think it would really help him if he had a nice mechanical keyboard to use for his work. I have a board of blue's myself, but when he tried it it didn't seem to work so well and he was typing pretty slowly, although I'm not sure if that's because of the switches themselves or because I have blank keycaps. 




I'm just wondering if any of you have any advice as to what the best switch type would be for someone like him. I know reds are linear and don't require a whole lot of activation force, but I think my dad prefers the tactile sensation (he did a lot of work on typewriters back in the day). I'm just worried that blues require too much activation force for his fingers, so would browns work better?

So I started out with a Rosewill RK9000, blues, and while I love the keyboard (got custom red keycaps for it, etc.) I just got a little tired of the full board setup. So, I got a KBT Race with blacks. I love the KBT Race, perfect small form, I can work on the thing for hours. I've had the KBT for quite some time now and while I read that the LEDs on it might go out, I thought I was good. Well, I was wrong. One LED completely burned out, some are flickering, some are dimming (just about to go off completely). Fast forward to right now and I'm back on my RK9000 simply loving MX Blues. 

I don't really care for LEDs anymore, in fact I really really don't care about them.  What I also don't care about is a full board setup. So, basically I'm just looking for a TKL with Blues. 

Now the Ducky PRO TKL (white PBTs, MX Blues) is within my budget, $125. The Filco Majestouch (ninja, MX Blues) on the other hand, from what I can find, will run me about $158. I guess the price difference isn't all that much, but for the money that I will be spending I'd like to get something solid and something I wont be regretting later on (what I'm feeling about my KBT with gimped LEDs now).

Well, regarding the dirt, it worked quite well. I removed just a lot. However, now I'm stuck with 5 keys that I can't hook to the keyboard.

I could put back almost every key in place perfectly, even big ones like shift, tab and backspace. However, I think I damaged the retainer clip in some normal sized ones.

What I should do?
I think the only thing I could do is to buy new retainers, right? I took a look at laptopkeys.com, but it's extremely expensive! $4.95 per key, plus shipping. It's almost a new keyboard. Besides that, I don't need the keys, just the hooks.

I've lurked around this subreddit for quite sometime. I have finally decided to pick up a mechanical keyboard.

I don't care for backlighting or macros, I play fps and third person shooters the most. My concern is that from what I've heard the cherry MX black are stiff and cause fatigue after a while of use (Is that true?) and the cherry MX red isn't great for typing because they are way too sensitive.

I'm a student and I do I have papers to write, I really love the corsair k60 and I'm wondering how is typing on that keyboard - does it get better with time or not at all. 

Other suggestions are more than welcome but please note my limited budget and inability to purchase online.

Heavy touch, light touch, activation and feedback... I've read all that, and I pretty much understand their differences.

That however does not tell me what they feel like. I can't seem to figure out how they'll 'feel' based on the description, and my last experience with a Model M buckling spring is a good 10-15 years back. From what I recall, I enjoyed it.. but I had zero clue about keyboards back then.

I basically know which keyboard I'd ideally want given my budget (QPAD MK-50: **~EUR 75,-**), but that simply isn't happening because it's been constantly unavailable with the MX Browns that I want. The MK-80 (**~EUR 108,-**) and especially the MK-85 (**~EUR 125,-**) are simply too expensive to get simply for a brown cherries. That means MK-50 Blues are probably the most sensible option.

And then I found out they're having a nice discount for christmas: MK-85 MX Red for **~EUR 85,-**. Macro keys, key lighting, etc etc... that makes that one a pretty tempting upgrade, even if it isn't the kind of key I was eyeing originally. (But neither are MX Blues, so I'm not getting the ideal choice regardless.)

My problem is that I can't imagine what typing on MX Reds feels like. I know the specs: very light touch, linear, meant for gaming. From what I read, some people can adjust, others cannot.

So here's my question: going from a decent rubber domes keyboard, how bad can the switch to the 'least personally suitable' mechanical keyboard possibly get? (After getting used to it, that is).

Is my theoretically worst mechanical keyboard a downgrade? Or slightly above what I am using? I don't really care about the switch type for this; more-so personal experiences of people having hands-on experience with the different switches.

Sorry for the long post. :-)

Posting here because the Dvorak reddit isn't very active and users on any Colemak fora would be inherently biased.*

---

The Colemak website makes its layout sound great, better in many aspects even than the venerable Dvorak. There's an obvious bias issue in reading arguments from only one side, though, and typically Dvorak advocacy only compares Dvorak to Qwerty.

I don't mean to make the choice of a keyboard layout sound overly religious, but it takes a bit of time and effort to learn a new layout so I want my choice to be an informed one.

So my question then is, what are some downsides to Colemak, mainly compared to Dvorak? Is there anyone who switched from Qwerty to Dvorak, rejecting Colemak after having investigated it? For what reasons?

I imagine making Colemak easier to learn coming from Qwerty necessitated certain trade-offs, compared to designing an optimal layout from scratch. One issue I considered is that there's a Programmer Dvorak layout and none for Colemak, but when I looked closer it seems that Programmer Dvorak is worse for programming [in Haskell]. I could be wrong though because I only tested it for a select few operators.

I also want a layout that's well-supported out of the box on at least Linux, so that excludes the layouts suggested by Carpalx.",,False,self,t5_2rm65,1348699730.0,,,True,t3_10j5vg,http://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/10j5vg/downsides_to_colemak/,

I chose it because it wasn't too expensive, it had Cherry red switches, and it had media keys, which are very important to me. I love the keyboard a lot except for one thing: some of the keys are so easy to press that I find myself constantly pressing them by accident.


The two keys that are the most problematic are the spacebar and shift key. This wasn't a big deal, I imagined, since in time I'd adjust my typing to work better with the keyboard. After 2 weeks of using the keyboard, I loved how responsive it felt, and there was no way I was going back, but I still hadn't figured out how to not accidentally press the spacebar when not typing at all (my thumb rests on the spacebar and I constantly find myself accidentally pressing it) or sometimes pressing shift by accident in the middle of a word. It didn't seem like that big of a deal to me, since I knew that I could just buy replacement switches.


I picked up some Cherry blacks from WASD Keyboards. Thinking it would be really easy to switch, I popped off the key caps, and realized it wasn't as easy as it looked on Youtube videos showing the process. I've tried using several different objects to get the switches open, and I was able to open up the replacement Cherry blacks that I bought after using them to practice, but I just can't seem to get it work with the switches on the K60. Most recently, I slightly warped the plastic switch casing trying to remove it, and it still didn't budge. 


From looking at pictures and reading descriptions, it definitely seems like the K60 is PCB-mounted rather than plate-mounted, so I thought I'd be able to change the switches without soldering. I've never soldered anything before and I'm not interested in doing it with this keyboard considering my lack of experience.


Is it possible to replace switches on the Corsair K60? Is there any trick to removing switches that I should know about? This keyboard is nearly perfect for me, so I'm not interested in just getting a keyboard with blacks or browns, because I like reds for everything *except* the spacebar and shift key.

I first considered the [Das Ulitimate Silent](http://www.amazon.com/Das-Keyboard-Ultimate-Silent-Mechanical/dp/B003M4XGI4/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I2JA2N01SGD6AF&amp;colid=2II5G8OZDSLJH) but have since decided I'd prefer a smaller, more minimalistic keyboard. (The unmarked keycaps are a plus, but not a dealbreaker by any means.) 

So, I'm currently looking at three contenders. I would prefer Mx Browns, but I would consider Blues, too. (Though I doubt I'd want any other switches.) I've looked at [This Filco,](http://www.amazon.com/Filco-Majestouch-2-Tenkeyless-FKBN87M-EB2/dp/B004WOF7QM/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341533454&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=filco+tenkeyless) [this Leopold](http://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=leopold,tenkeyless&amp;pid=fc200rtabn) (aww yeah for no markings), and even this [Cooler Master Storm.](http://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-QuickFire-Mechanical-SGK-4000-GKCL1-US/dp/B0068INSUM/ref=sr_1_12?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1341533454&amp;sr=1-12&amp;keywords=filco+tenkeyless)

Of these keyboards, are any particularly notable for being good/bad? I don't do any gaming, just email-cranking, programming, and reddit-commenting. Is the Filco worth $40 than the Leopold? As far as aesthetics, I actually prefer the Storm's colors, then the Filco (though it isn't a big deal.)

It arrived yesterday, and when I first started typing on it, I noticed that the ""a"" key would double or even triple up when I pressed it. I continued using it for a bit, as this issue only occurred about half the time. But as I used the keyboard more, the ""a"" key started to only work about half the time, and then completely stopped working. I'm planning to return it to the seller and wait for another deal on a mechanical keyboard to pop up, as I really don't have much money to spend on a keyboard. But before I send it back, I thought I would ask the nice people in this subreddit if this is a problem I can easily fix, or if I should just go ahead and send it back?

Basically, we create a queue of people who sign up for it, and whoever is at the top of the queue (organizer) sends out a keycap(s) to the next person in line. When that person receives their keycaps, they send the person after them on the list a package with a keycap(s). Everybody gets to expand their keycap collection and we get to pay it back to people in the community. 

I would recommend that everybody send a unique keycap, like something from a group buy. Basically, anything that isn't just a standard keycap (basically no ""stock keys""), also, for a keycap that is super common like the red on white GEEK HACK key (which had 1000+ keys produced, any other GEEK HACK keys would b e fair game though), maybe send a couple caps. Anything past that would be on the sender to go above and beyond. 


So for example:

1. s32 - sends a riddlers question mark and pi keycap to person2 

2. person2 - sends a cherry logo PBT cap to person3 

3. person3 - sends a triforce modifier to person4 

4. person4 - sends a clickclack (LUCKY!) blank to person5

5. person5 - sends a weezer ""W"" key to person6

6. person6 - sends a reddit alien PBT to person7

7. person7 - sends a hashbaz RGB kit to person8
...

15\. person15 - sends a hieroglyphics double shot to person...



in the case of a clickclack/RGB/some other expensive key(s), it would be on the sender to want to send them somethign so special/expensive.

I'd also probably like to get one or two ""backup"" people on that would be willing to send out a package to somebody if we had a deadbeat or two. I could cover 1-2 extra packages, but wouldn't hurt to get some others that could help in that case. I don't expect to have that many, but might as well be safe.

 * I have a budget of $150 AUD.
 * The keyboard must work on my MacBook but I don't need an OS X specific layout on it since I often run Windows 7 in a virtual machine.
 * While lighter weight is better, higher durability is more important to me.

Other than that:

 * Cherry Blue or Brown switches seem ideal because I'll be programming on this keyboard.
 * Blank keys and a black colour scheme would be nice. I also intend to buy and use custom keycaps at some point.
 * Any sort of a case or protective gear is a definite bonus.

* Razer Anansi

I have tried the Razer BlackWidow with MX Cherry Blues (Clicky ones) and have noticed something... when pressing down a key, once I am at the bottom, if i move the key up and down, but not high enough to reset the spring, the keyboard still types that key. 

Is this usual for the Razer BlackWidow or MX Blue key types? Or is this phenomenon found in every mechanical keyboard?",,False,self,t5_2rm65,True,,,True,t3_mfx5u,http://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/mfx5u/mechanical_keyboard_razer_blackwidow_phenomenom/,

Right now I have the Black Widow ( non blacklit) and the Sidewinder x4.

I always was interested in the Das but I went with the widow instead ( quite some time ago) 

If I were to try ( or buy ) a Das, would I notice a difference between that and my widow?",,False,self,t5_2rm65,False,,,True,t3_mfwxe,http://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/mfwxe/whats_the_main_difference_between_the_black_widow/,
