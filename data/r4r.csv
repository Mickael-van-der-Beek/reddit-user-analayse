1328821664.0,457,self.r4r,pibat,Your Personal Cupid,Cutepid,521,64,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/pibat/your_personal_cupid/,"**SUPER ULTRA MEGA IMPORTANT EDIT** - Since so many people have expressed interest in helping out, I have made a separate topic [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/pk7i6/important_update_from_your_personal_cupid/) to discuss it. Please take a second to read it! Thanks! :)

So you're lonely. You've tried it all: eharmony, match, pof, chemistry... Everything. Forever, it just seems like there is no one out there for you. Then you hear about r4r. You figure, ""Eh, what the heck."" And give it a shot. You're pretty numb to the fact that, yet again, you have been let down. Is there seriously no help for you? Are you doomed to be forever alone? Fret not my friends, I am here to help.

**Who am I:** I am a gender neutral entity that exists to help you find someone on reddit who will break your cycle of forever alone.

**How:** Message me and tell me a bit about yourself (criteria will be listed later) and a little about who you would like to meet. You can be as descriptive or geberal as you please, but finding a happy medium will increase your chances of finding someone compatible. I will then attempt to find a good match for you based on what others have sent me.

**Why trust you:** Firstly, because I earnestly want to help alleviate the sadness that comes from being alone, as I know it too well. Secondly, because you have nothing left to lose and everything to gain.

**How long will this take:** I can't say for sure. Days, maybe weeks. This is my first time trying this, but I really want you all to succeed, so I will do my best.

**What compensation do you require:** None. Just pay it forward I suppose. There are lots of lonely people out there who need a hand or deserve a chance at love. If you can, just think about them.

**What Cutepid Needs From You to Get Started:**

*You:*

Gender

Age

Location (Relative is fine)

Height/Weight/Ethnicity (because, unfortunately, people can be picky)

Hobbies/Interests

*Them*

Whatever requisites that you feel necessary to form a connection

Again, be as descriptive as you want and don't be shy. I won't judge you and your information will remain confidential. When I determine a match can be made, I will notify both parties. At this point, if you wish, I can disclose your information to each other or I can merely exchange your user names and you guys can go from there. I know the mystery can be a bit exciting at times ;) Anyway, do your worst and I'll do my best!


P.S. I wrote this on my phone and I know there are some errors, but by jove I am too lazy to fix them.

Edit 1: Great googly moogly this is getting a lot more attention than I expected! This is a good thing  though! I'm looking forward to working with you all to make love! Err... To make love last! Anyway, it's going to take some time, and I will say that I an getting a majority of messages from a certain demographic, but think if it this way: the more popular this gets the better your chances! Don't get discouraged if nothing happens today, I'm still wading through messages and I WILL get to you and I will try my darndest to find someone for you!

Edit 2: Ok, my phone battery got eaten up pretty fast. Since I an at work for another hour and a half, it'll be just a bit before I can reply again. Once I get back home, though, the game is on!

Edit 3: I'm back at it. There are so many responses! Firstly, yes guys, there **are** ladies responding. I am trying to figure out the best way to organize all the information that has been messaged to me so thar I can find potential matches. I'm holding on tight because I think this will be one hell of a ride!

Edit 4: TWO months of gold?! Wow guys, thanks!! Seriously though, save your money, you'll need it for the date I'll hopefully be setting you up on ;) On a serious note, keep the responses coming, but note that, while a few matches happened tonight, most of them won't be sent out until later tonight my time or tomortow morning as I am still organizing all the information you wonderful people have sent. Don't feel discouraged if you don't get a message by then, remember that I said this might take time. Thank you so much for your patience!

Edit 5: Good news and bad news. The good news, for you guys, is that there are lots of girls as well! The bad news, for you guys, is there are lots and lots and lots of guys! I should be sending out a wave of matches in the coming hours (I finally managed to shift through most of the messages), but let me stress that this is ONLY the beginning, and if you do NOT receive a message soon I have not forgotten about you! Love takes time!

Edit 6: Phew, the first ""real"" round of matches is over for tonight. I know many of you have yet to receive a message, but I promise to get to you! Still the responses are pouring in and it's a little overwhelming but I wouldn't have signed on for the job if I didn't believe I could do it. Keep them coming, don't ever think it's too late. That being said, I'm going to take my break for the evening and I will resume my duties in the morning!

Edit 7 (8:50 A.M. PST): Some more matches have gone out. Unfortunately I have an 8 hour shift ahead of me and no access to data I compiled last night. Expect some delay between now and the next batch of match, but I hopefully will be able to get a few in before I' off :)",,False,,t5_2rn0e,True,,,True,t3_pibat,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/pibat/your_personal_cupid/,

I am no longer taking applications for this stage of Personal Cupid! Please keep your eyes open for the update thread!

----

After the success of the previous cupid ideas, I figured I'd throw my hat in the ring and try to help some people out. 

**Intro**

I am a happily married man so I have no personal vested interest in meeting someone, which allows me to provide an objective view for compatibility matches.

**Why personal cupid?**

You've tried it all: OkCupid, PoF, r4r threads and even going outside to meet people. But this hasn't seemed to work, and you can't trust a computer to crunch numbers and find you a match, or your ads just didn't catch the right eye.

**How do I join?**

Simple! Send me a PM with following the guidelines below, and I'll attempt to get you matched asap. Don't worry - you won't just be thrown together with the first person of the opposite (or same!) gender.

**Required Info**

*You:*

Age, gender, location, current occupation, stats (height / weight / ethnicity), hobbies and five words to describe yourself. Also include your preference of relationship, skype buddy, fwb, etc!

*Them:*

What are you looking for? Age range, gender, location, stats, their ideal evening / Sunday, interests.. write a brief description of your preferred match!

**Guidelines**

Note that if you do not send a picture (not required) you will not be paired with someone who did send a picture. Fair is fair. When you are matched with someone I will send the picture along with their details, because let's be honest - everyone wants to see the face of whom they are speaking with.

Have an open mind! 

If you use a throwaway - CHECK YOUR INBOXES REGULARLY. I do not want to match someone after 4 days only for them never to log in to their account again.

Have fun :)

----

Sidenote: There have been 3 personal cupid events that I know of, and all were successful; unfortunately it seems the idea of the subreddit didn't take off so I'm going to try and be a full-time r4r matcher! I'm not looking to branch off in to my own sub or anything like that, since r4r is a pretty awesome place, I'm just trying to make it a little bit more awesome!

EDIT: When sending a picture you should know that it is sometimes possible to find someones Facebook profile thru the URL. I would advise uploading your images to a different host (such as imgur) in future. Your privacy is safe with me but you never know who might be out there. *x-files music*

Update: I have sent out a few quick matches after seeing them while transferring applications in to a more readable and accessible format. If you got one, congratulations! If not, don't worry I will be finishing the process tomorrow. I received over 300 applications today so you can imagine how difficult that may be! Expect your inboxes to start filling up tomorrow as I find matches for you all :)",,False,,t5_2rn0e,1360509574.0,,,True,t3_186t4d,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/186t4d/your_personal_cupid/,

A few months ago I booked a week long vacation at a lake house in southern Wisconsin for me and my wife when I return.  A few weeks later I found out she was cheating on me.  I was about to cancel the vacation today, but decided to go anyways.  So now I'm looking for a female friend to go with me and my dog.  

The vacation is planned for the first week of September.  If you are interested, I would like to talk to you a few times and maybe meet for lunch prior to the trip.  This way we can make sure we at least will be able to get along and be comfortable around each other.  The food and lodging has already been paid for by me.  I can pick you up or you can drive there yourself.

About me: I'm a 27 year old guy.  5 foot 10 200 lbs.  I like sci-fi and fantasy shows, movies, and books.  My favorite tv shows at the moment are, Game of Thrones, Supernatural, Doctor Who, and It's always Sunny.  I enjoy taking pictures, and consider myself an amateur photographer.  Though, I'll be the first to admit my photos are not perfect.

Activities I would like us to do:  I would enjoy going for walks around the lake, a picnic, maybe some canoeing and swimming.  Sitting/cuddling by the fire or watch a movie late at night.  I am looking for something relaxing after the past year being high tempo.  If there are things you would like to do while we are there I would love to hear it.

You: a female between the ages of 21 and 33. Be in decent shape, i would like to go hiking.  Enjoy outdoor activities, and be open to trying new things.  Sex and kissing are not expected of you, but I would like to cuddle.  There are several bedrooms, so sleeping together is also not expected.

Message me and tell me about yourself.

So, I've posted here a few times.. I wanted to make one a while ago, but, I couldn't log on this account so I used a different one, and because of that, whenever I made an R4R, it got deleted.. people thought I was a liar, though I'm not sure why someone would lie about being in a wheelchair. I verified myself to a mod a month or so ago. I've been homeschooled since 7th grade, I'm a junior in Hs. I left school because I wanted to study more, and learn from a teacher, not a class


I started getting into video games upon joining Homeschool, mostly World of NoLifeCraft (WoW). I made almost all my friends there, but I haven't met them in person, yet. I'm not afraid to admit it!


I have a really dark sense of humor. I've been published twice for poetry, and am currently working on a book. I've never had a boyfriend.. or been kissed, or anything. I do believe theres a person for everyone, I'm not saying I'm looking for a relationship in this, but if we like each other, then that's cool, I've had a long distance relationship before, it was somewhat serious and we did plan on meeting, but it didn't work out.


I'm a shy person when you first meet me. I'm different around other people. I'm great at reading people. Chameleon soul? Once you get to know me, I'll be myself. I love reading, writing, making people laugh, being myself, I love the rain and snow, I used to live 40 mins from Seattle before I moved to cali - don't get me wrong, beaches are great!





I have SMA 2, my disease. As I get older, my body gets weaker. Basically I'm paralyzed from the waist down but I can still feel everything. I'm too weak to move my body around...I can move my arms/legs, and can do my makeup, hair, type, write in my journal, eat, etc... yes, I can have sex :3



If you PM me, can you please send a pic of yourself? I'll send more if you want. I just wanna make sure I'm not talking to a creepy 68 year old man





I'm just looking for someone...I'm not sure how to word it...I think you get it? :)

This might get me banned, downvoted, or lit on fire.. but I want to share my personal r4r experience with you. It's only fair that the guys here know what they're up against. I submitted an r4r post (that has since been deleted) on Thursday. A friend and I have sorted through all of the replies and categorized them. Keep in mind, these replies all came through in a matter of hours, because I deleted it later that night due to being overwhelmed. You can see the spreadsheet here:

http://i.imgur.com/kNVi1z4.jpg

That's how many. **164.** When you ask that girl you meet from r4r how many replies she got to her post. That's only with me leaving mine up for not even an entire night. So next time you get huffy if a girl doesn't reply to your message that says ""Hey this is my skype, add me! Talk to you soon!"" ....now you can maybe understand.

I have had some success with my post, but I just want to let you guys know that part of getting a reply in r4r is speed.. beating the pack to the punch. But the even bigger part is standing out. If your message isn't interesting, it's going to look like the other 100 messages I've already read over with glazed eyes. I'm sad that I might have missed out on getting to know someone amazing because their message got both buried and looked over.

**edit** Please please just remember that this is only one girl's perspective. What works for me may not work for you. I'm not saying give up on r4r.. I'm just letting you know the statistics of my personal experience. There is no 100% foolproof solution to this.

I am not a fan of derogatory comments. If you're being an asshole, I'm going to delete your comment and politely ask you to discontinue. If the behavior continues, I have no qualms with banning you from the sub. This is a **safe haven** for people to find whatever it is they desire. 

**I'm sorry** if a lot of what people look for is sex. It's a basic human need that a lot of people would like to fulfill and sometimes they turn to the internet for that. This is an okay place for such people to do something like that. *This does not give you the right to judge them just because it's not something you're looking for as well.* Again, if you disprove, MOVE ON. They are well within the rules of the subreddit.

**Me:**

* I'm 25 years old and in a wheelchair.

* 4 years ago I lost the ability to put hand to cock &amp; masturbate.

* Watching pornography **used** to stimulate me enough that the combination of watching and flexing my kegel muscles would allow me to cum. Unfortunately it just doesn't stimulate me enough anymore, because everything I do is cerebral, I really need that stimulation.

* Currently flexing my kegel muscles allows me to experience a mild orgasm without cum (think permanent edging).

* Getting a 'pro' would be awesome, unfortunately I'm in the middle of nowhere.


So, yeah. I have a friend from World of Warcraft who is into the whole exhibitionism thing, but she met someone IRL and has been in a relationship for the past seven months and I have respected their relationship and not done anything online since then with her. I've tried sites like MFC but that is crazy expensive and honestly they don't seem to enjoy it, so that really kills it for me also. 
____________________________________________________

**What I'm after:**

* I am looking for a girl who is an exhibitionist. 

* I want to watch you strip and/or masturbate.

* I really enjoy women of all shapes and sizes.

* I can be as involved or uninvolved as you want, if you just want someone to watch you, I can do that, if you're looking for something more (dom) I would be interested in that as well.

If you want to see me, I have a webcam, if not that is totally fine. I have tried quite a few times here and have gotten mixed responses, a lot of positive support, a lot of questions, and a few tools (as expected), but when it came to it, only one has gone through and that was quite a while ago, I would really really like someone on a regular basis.

I've posted a few times before (elsewhere) and have yet to get a reply; understandably so, I know my situation is definitely WTFish, that said this is going to be my last time asking for help because making this post makes me feel shitty enough, let alone making it three times and never getting a reply (maybe I should have taken a hint). I'm just going to be blunt because there's really no easy way of this getting across. I'm looking for a girl to cam2cam with me on Skype/MSN. I have a from of Muscular Dystrophy, I've never walked. My disease is pretty much like being paralyzed with the exceptions that I can feel everything (I'm actually hypersensitive). It is kind of a double-edged sword. I used to be able to jerk off but 4 years ago I lost the ability to (my muscles were limited when I was younger but I was able to physically jerk off). Basically all I can do now is slide my mouse across the table, I use voice recognition software and on-screen keyboard to type my messages. I used to be able to get off to porn, unfortunately it just doesn't work anymore. I haven't officially came in months and I'm kind of going crazy. I am able to orgasm without cum, but that's just not as gratifying. Because I can't use my hand for physical stimulation, I have to concentrate on imagining what I'm doing, watching someone else enjoying themselves is pretty much the only way I can anymore. I am a fan of the buildup, and the communication (I get off knowing that someone else is). I've tried camsites like Chaturbate &amp; MFC but everyone there seems like they don't enjoy themselves (not to mention it is pretty expensive). I fully understand that there is going to be a lot of skepticism on your part as to the legitimacy of my post, and I am willing to do or prove whatever you would like. To be blunt, I'm not able to finish without either watching or hearing you, so a pure text based chat isn't going to do it for me.





I fully understand what I am asking you, and I'm not going to pressure you one bit. I have no problem just talking for a while so we get to know each other, if after we talk you decide that you don't want to that is perfectly fine and we can go our separate ways (or we could continue talking in a nonsexual way). I enjoy listening to music (Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Miles Davis, Nirvana, John Coltrane, Pearl Jam,), reading (Steinbeck, Hunter S Thompson, David Foster Wallace), watching television (Scrubs, The Wire, Justified, Mad Men, Sons of Anarchy, Warehouse 13, Bored to Death, The Newsroom, and of course Breaking Bad) I'm also a fan of the Oxford comma.

It seems like there's a huge imbalance on R4R: there are a lot more males simply looking for casual sex than there are females, and many of the females seem to be seeking dating/relationships. As such, rather than trying to organize 'creepy', send-women-running-for-the-hills events like gangbangs, why don't we try and organize some type of speed dating events in our various local areas?

Find a public space, set the time, and have time-limited conversations with whatever your counterpart group is (x4y with y4x,  etc). If you click, congratulations! You just saved us all from either another 0-point m4f post or another f4m with 80-odd comments and an inevitable slew of PMs containing dick pics.

Pros:

-you actually get out of the house and talk to people!  
-you're much more good-looking when you're animated, talking, and in sunlight!  
-you can actually display your sense of humor, rather than just alluding to it!  
-what you see is what you get!  
-For the ladies: you're unlikely to see a penis out of the blue!  
-For the gents: you don't have to compete with a thousand penises in the mailbox to get her to hear what you're saying!  

Cons:

-you have to leave the house and talk to people.  
-direct sunlight makes it hard to read Reddit on your phone.

You connect to an IRC server which hosts a lot of chat rooms. There are tons of chat rooms out there for all kinds of topics. 


You can connect via chat clients if you frequent irc a lot, but it is also very easy to just connect and have a short chat with people via webclients. For example:

- [freenode webchat client](http://webchat.freenode.net/) (freenode hosts most subreddit chat rooms)

- [mibbit webchat client](http://www.mibbit.com/) (irc webclient for -any irc-network)

- [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/) (Installable desktop chat client)


You do not need to create an account or anything. You just drop into the chatroom with a certain topic and start chatting right away. Double clicking on somebodies name starts a private chat. 


There are a lot of chat rooms for subreddits on freenode.net, the freenode staff even has a naming convention for subreddits there.
namely: #reddit-subredditname


Only downside (for some of you if you care about this) is that it is possible for others to see your ip address. This is how ever a non issue if you ask me. Seeing as it is also possible to see the ip address of the other user if you chat with skype or msn. Though that requires slightly more effort. If you're very concious about your anonymity you should stick to private messages over reddit. There are extra ways of hiding your anonymity but that'd be a more technical in-dept discussion which is not the point of this topic.

-STD free (condoms mandatory and will be provided)
- 18/19 male or T, and reside in the lower mainland of Vancouver, BC (verification will be asked for by pic)
- open to any race or sexual preference. If you are gay, T, or straight...all the same to me.
- inexperienced, virgins or otherwise  unconfident in your prowess..I want to talk to you.
- You must be emotionally stable and sexually uninhibited (no hang ups).
-Completely understand and accept the arrangement as described here and in PMs.

1332773786.0,134,self.r4r,re94v,Some r4r hacks: Tips from a lady redditor,thewingwoman,158,24,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/re94v/some_r4r_hacks_tips_from_a_lady_redditor/,"As you are all very aware, the ratio of men to women posters/lurkers is definitely not 1. Female posters are swamped with messages (it's not uncommon for a F4M/R post to get over 70 replies within the first hour) so we definitely do become a tad bit more selective when deciding which messages garner a response. 


*When replying to a post…*


**READ!** Show that you read the post, even if it was tl;dr worthy. If you ask a question that was answered in the OP, it’s going to look like a default message you reply to ever F4R with. Not only that, you’ll know exactly what their intentions are by reading – if she’s just looking for a hookup, an online friend, a cuddle buddy. The OP’s intentions pretty much dictate your reply, if you don’t respect or reflect them… then you shouldn’t be responding. Beneficial for everyone.


**Please, please, please attempt to use correct spelling/grammar.** I’m not saying all girls are grammar nazi and I’m not even saying that all girl’s on reddit are “intelligent,” but it’s something everyone notices and subconsciously judges/makes note of.


**Don’t open with an insult or skepticism.** The whole “there are no girls on the internet” dogma is generally unwitty in these situations. Also, don’t openly admit that you think she might be a troll or a guy. C’mon.


**Before you start to type “I know you’re probably getting swamped with…” STOP.** As they always say, anything that comes before “but” is usually bullshit. In this case it’s just unnecessary. It just makes it seem as if you’re worried about all the other replies, but more importantly it gets old. At least 40% of all messages begin this way (arbitrary, made up, but totally plausible statistics… I know.)


**If she says she’s just looking for someone to chat with online, don’t ask her where she’s from right off the bat.** For the most part it’s irrelevant and unimportant for obvious reasons. If it’s important to you and you don’t want to waste time chatting with someone 4000 miles away, then she’s probably not what you’re looking for anyways and vice versa. People rarely forget to include their location in their post, and most often an omission has nothing to do with privacy. 


**If she says she’s just looking for someone to chat with online, don’t let “what do you look like?” or “do you have a pic?” be your first question** – in fact, don’t even bring it up for a while. Sure, you could be talking to an uggo… but if the intentions are a platonic relationship, when why does it matter? Hot girls and uggos alike will probably be offended that you only care about physical appearances, especially when attraction is so irrelevant when exchanging a few IMs/PMs or becoming internet friends. 


**Remember, lots of girls play video games and a large portion of females on reddit are gamers.** I know for a lot of girls, it’s odd to be put on a pedestal for partaking in something a vast majority of our generation does. So she likes video games, cool. Instead of saying something along the lines of “OMG you liked Mega Man 2? You are my dream girl,” ask her what her favorite games are. If you wouldn’t say it to a guy, don’t say it to a girl.


**Separate your GW and r4r alt accounts.** If you use 1 account for daily redditing and everything else, that’s cool too. We all glance over user posts/comments and I can tell you that depending on the nature of an r4r post, you’re going to be judged harshly if your entire commenting history is 90% “I would love to eat that pussy” or in GW. Nothing is wrong with being sexual, nothing wrong whatsoever, but we hope you’re also reading the other great content on reddit. What you comment on shows what’s important to you – it’s not like we are doing a background check, but seeing a bunch of NSFW tags on a user overview is pretty obvious visually.


*When you don’t get a response…*


I know it's common courtesy to shoot a quick message even if saying you're not interested, but given the number of messages it becomes time consuming and rather than focusing attention on those we want to pursue we're left crafting sincere and apologetic ""rejection letters"" (that suck for both parties.) Generic ""Not interested"" replies are almost rude and extremely impersonal.


Don’t be offended if you get a few responses and then never receive a reply back – chances are your message got lost in the mess that is reddit’s PM system, she’s coming back to it, or she has just completely forgot. If she took the time to respond the first time, then she’s definitely intrigued by you. If you haven’t heard back from her in a reasonable amount of time (give her a day or two), PM her again. It’s assertive and she’ll see that you’re interested in her enough to pursue her.


**tl;dr – Read posts and act appropriately. Don’t be offended by rejection.**

I realize a lot of these should go without saying, but if I hadn't frequently experienced them myself then I wouldn't have felt the need to say anything. Just trying to help everyone out.

After just a few days of chatting, we decided to meet up in person.  We're both from upstate NY so the drive is not bad at all. 

When we first met in person, it wasn't awkward at all, which I was very surprised at. We immediately started laughing and joking around; it was easy to see that we were pretty comfortable with each other. We spent the day together laughing and  talking about anything that came to mind, and planned to meet again the next weekend. 

We talked nonstop that next week and it was easy to see that we were both really interested in each other. We made plans to meet up every weekend, and were both really excited and anxious to see each other during the week long breaks.

Hello again Reddit! You may remember me as the unwitting opener of Pandora's Box from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/pibat/your_personal_cupid/) post. Firstly, I wanted to say THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR YOUR RESPONSES! There are LOTS of people who want to find their counterpart, and I am still working hard to make it happen. Tons of guys and gals have reached out to me with their hopes and dreams for a significant other and I truly want to do my best to make it happen!

However, **there is a way we can still make this happen**. That's right, *we*. Along with with the messages sent to me for people looking for matches, there has been a number of people who have expressed interest in being match makers. Thus, I have a proposition:

**We make this a thing!**

No, but seriously. There are a lot of people out there that want to be happy and there is a growing number of people who want to help make people happy. This is a wonderful thing, and I with the help of the Reddit community I think we can make it happen. Here is my essential idea (which is totally open to remodeling based on your input). We make a subreddit. Something like /r/cupids. We then gather a group of individuals interested in matchmaking. They will be given an area they are familiar with (or even live in) to govern. A directory will be made of ""cupids"" for the particular area. A person who is looking for a match will send their information to this ""cupid"" and he/she will then be tasked with finding that persons match. I know many people are interested with meeting people that live outside their general area, but at first I would like to try facilitating matches within each persons respective living zones, so as to increase the possibility of making this last. Cupids will also, hopefully, provide the people they match with some insight. You know, places to go for a date and other general advice (another important reason to pick Cupids that have knowledge of the area they govern). Maybe this is all just a pipe dream, but if you're going to dream, it might as well be big, right?

I've been working on a web app that does Personal Cupid for redditors. I'm about a week in, I only get to work on in it in the little spare time I have. In addition to matchmaking, it allows for group meetups you RSVP for, etc. I realize there's other things that do this, but the Reddit crowd has its own needs and frankly, I really didn't like what was out there.

So far:

* Authenticates to Reddit for ""Certified Redditor"" status.
* Has some basic profile features with pictures. Includes a link to your personal Reddit thread if you have one.
* Matches users based on mutual activity interests, but hides any that aren't mutual (if you're looking for a breakfast partner, it's irrelevant they are looking for breakfast and a one night stand).
* Uses geolocation info to find the Redditors within X distance you specify.
* Framework currently matches on gay/straight/bisexual male/female, but I could open it up to work with about anything else.
* Heavy on privacy settings. Share as much or as little as you like.
* Twitter bootstrap based, so it works well with mobile phones and the like.

Here's a bunch of screenshots:

I predicted to have maybe one response on the M4F post, and possibly ten or so on the F4M one.  Let's just put it this way... I was VERY wrong.

So here's my deal, I'm an English girl, very nearly 24 years old. It has recently been brought to my attention that I spend the vast majority of my free time alone in my room. Apparently this is not healthy behaviour and as much as I’d like to tell myself otherwise, I know this is very probably true.


So I've decided something has to change. Unfortunately, that means I'm going to have to step out of my comfort zone. However, the chances of me just stepping out of my comfort zone are incredibly slim; I’d really need to be pulled out, rather forcefully.


So here's where I’m hoping one of you fine people come in. I'm looking for a penpal... kind of. Well, we'd use videos instead of pens. A videoPal if you will? 


The challenge I propose is as follows. We'd set up a joint youtube channel and for the next year we post videos to each other. The only rule is that you can't record any videos from inside your house. The idea being, we’d film from as many different locations as possible, doing varying degrees of fun things. In fact, we don’t even have to be doing anything fun, just as long as we're NOT in our house!


The content of the video doesn't really matter, I'd rather it just be casual. Preferably not even edited. We could even make our channel private so just the two of us can watch them, I don't particularly need YouTube comments telling me I'm the worst thing to have ever existed. I could do without that.


Why video? Well because... I'm a liar. If this was an ordinary penpal scenario, I'd be telling you tales of my adventures at the seaside without ever having left my bed, I'm sneaky like that. So making a video would force me to actually get outside, even if it's just to walk down my road while I tell you about my uneventful day. I've heard good things about fresh air.


So yeah, there you have it! Bish. Bash. Bosh. I’d get a resemblance of a life, you’d... also benefit in some way. Just think, this could be the start of a beautiful friendship! Either that, or it'll be the most awkward social experiment you've ever taken part in. Who knows!


If you’ve read this far and are at all interested, hit me up. Maybe we could email or Skype for a bit first to make sure you like the cut of my jib, then we’ll take it from there!


Cheers!




EDIT: Thank you all for your comments! Now hold on to your pants guys, I have actually replied in a video! 

http://youtu.be/iM4nD5ISQZY

Yeah, sorry. This video sucks potatoes and is really kind of pointless. But it was my first try so please go easy on me. My soul is like a fragile bird! I'll probably take it down in a few days anyway; I'm already ridiculously embarrassed by it. 

If you are seriously thinking of doing this, I would strongly suggest not over watching what you've done and just get it uploaded. Otherwise you may declare yourself to be the knobbiest of knobheads and be too discouraged to continue. But continue we shall! Shall we? 

The outside really was nice though.

There isn't a lot of information to work with here. The less you share, the more comfortable you feel, because you don't have to put yourself out there. But remember that you've already put yourself out there. You might as well go a little further.

Instead of trying to appear as casual as possible, why not share a little bit about your self. You don't have to to share life stories, or weird fetishes, but how about some interests, or some disinterests? How about some funny anecdotes? Don't pressure yourself into trying to think of some ""really awesome things"" but try to share more, try to share yourself as a person so that the readers can understand who you are and what you want to do for fun.

For Example:
Do you like drawing? Post a picture you did recently.
Do you like music? Link to some bands you like, or invite others to a concert.
Do you like video games? Find a Katamari Partner, or a pinball friend.

And finally, if you find yourself with a couple of responders, try to be courteous and talk with them. Discourse in a positive atmosphere, and share more. It can only help you find good people.

---

Of course this is all null and void if you're just looking for a fuck buddy or a hook up, if so, try to be clear in your intentions as well. None of us, guy or girl, enjoy being played. If you want to find a friend or a relationship then its acceptable to start with ""just want to hang out"" but if you're just looking for somebody sexual, then openly state so, there are plenty of people looking for you as well. ;)

I wanted to share our success story because I wanted to give those of you looking for something serious a dose of reality. The ratio of men to women here is a little staggering, and there are a lot of attention seekers, but you never know who else is here that is really looking for something meaningful. Don't give up!

Our story seems a little odd because everything went so fast (nobody's pregnant- promise). I posted last May and got a bunch of replies. He wasn't even the most promising of the guys I talked to! But he was smart and well read, and we continued messaging for days before we moved on to Steam and then Skype. After daily conversations on Skype, all other men were forgotten, and it was all about him. We met in August and said we would wait to see each other again at Thanksgiving. We didn't make it that long and met again in September, and October, and my family for Thanksgiving, his family for Christmas. We got engaged on New Year's Eve, then six months later, we had a destination wedding, and now I live with my new husband in California. We're lucky to be older (I'm 33 and he's 28) and have good jobs that allowed us to see each other to know that what we felt was real.

Here's what I learned and my advice for anyone who might want it:

Ladies, what worked for me was making my own post. I was very detailed about my turn offs and things that mattered to me. When I said that I wasn't into smokers, I totally got flack for that, but it's worth it if something matters to you. Don't be scared off by assholes. Just be honest. I would suggest replying to everyone. I know the expectation is ""omg dick picks for dayyyyys,"" but that wasn't my experience. I didn't share pictures right away, and my post was pretty clear that I wanted someone who was special. Lots of responses, but very few were looking for some DTF girl. Like I said, my guy wasn't the most promising, but once I started talking to him, it was clear that we could really connect. Give it a shot!

Gentlemen, my advice to you, if you are looking for something serious, is to go for the details. With the ladies, I think that those of us who are searching for something real are looking for someone that we can connect to, someone that makes us feel like we would always have something to talk about, like you and I have something in common that matters. Make sure you share that in your posts and messages! It's so hard to pay any attention to someone who doesn't even try to give you something to discuss. I know that you think the odds aren't in your favor and it's not worth it to spend all that time on one response, but maybe it is. Maybe you're wrong. Try!

Good luck, /r/r4r! I know it's a rough world out there, but I do think you can find the right person if you don't let the bitterness take over! I hope this helps!

I'm not a bad looking guy at all, and I'm told I have a good personality. I'm 6'5"", have a thin/lean body type, long hair, and glasses. I'm a white dude. I love art and I do freelance work.

I felt that the other Personal Cupids were becoming too restricted, so I decided I'd do it right and make a service that could reach everyone without limiting anyone. I have little else to do with my time, so I'm happy to work with the data I receive and give people match suggestions!

So just fill out the form above through google docs, and be on your way, we'll do our best to match everyone possible!

To keep this private, I will first send a little bit of information about the match to each person, and ask them to confirm if they would like to speak with their match. If both parties agree, I will then share the contact information of their choosing at that time.

Note: I will wait 24 hours before sending any match suggestions.

Edit: There were some concerns about the contact information. It is only used at this stage to notify you if you have a match. You can specify Reddit PM, cell phone number (If you're in the US or Canada), email, instant messaging, or something else. None of your contact info will be released to anyone else without your consent, and ONLY the contact info you want shared will be shared with that specific match (mainly just a way to connect you with them, initially).

Hi, friends!

I just wanted to give you all a little reminder on some of the rules of /r/r4r. They are always listed on the sidebar if you need to check them out!

&gt;1.  Absolutely no phone numbers, usernames, e-mail addresses, or personal information in the body or comments of your post!
&gt;2.  No posts in exchange for money, goods, or services.
&gt;3.  /r/r4r is an 18+ subreddit.
&gt;4.  Be civil. Don't be an asshole. No sexist generalizations. No racist and homophobic remarks/slurs. No ad hominems. No spamming the subreddit with the same comments over and over again.
&gt;5.  Moderators have a right to ban based upon these rules. If you have an issue with someone on the subreddit, please feel free to message the moderators or click ""report"" under a comment.

As of right now, I am having difficulties keeping up with the amount of posters posting their kik usernames in comments or in their posts. 

**PLEASE DO NOT POST YOUR KIK USERNAME/SCREEN NAME/EMAIL/PHONE NUMBER/ANY USERNAME FOR ANY SITE WITHIN THE BODY OR COMMENTS OF POSTS**

We ask you to not do this because the moderators cannot make sure that every username is actually from the person who wrote the post/comment. There are people out there who will do malicious things. It is best if you PM someone your username to keep in contact with them instead of putting it out on a public website. 

Thanks so much!

If you have any questions or comments or just want to rage at us, please message the moderators

We don't much care who you are or where you are from, age/race/sexuality/etc, but we would be more than happy to host you and your partner, if applicable, for christmas dinner, and maybe a boardgame or two (if you're into it).

- You burn like a lobster

- You have a big family

- You, or a friend, managed to sit on a thumb tack.  Blood was everywhere!  (Not literally)

Edit 2: Holy crapoly batman! I feel like a girl who just flashed r4r!

Edit 3: Did not expect this many upvotes... but no luck yet people :(  Then again, it being this long, would she even remember who I am?  Lost cause?  Fuck you I'm gonna try!

Work sucks. This week has been shit. My best friends have girlfriends now or are too busy trying to score, so I hardly ever get to talk and joke around with them anymore and it's lame. 

**About me:** I'm into murders and executions, mostly. Actually, I'm into quoting movies and TV shows and other funny things. I can be really inappropriate sometimes and laugh at things I shouldn't. I like cheesy jokes and puns too. I'm rarely serious about anything. I'm a little socially awkward. 

I like metal, science, science fiction, technology, horror movies, books, tattoos, gamer dudes, whiskey, smoking, and cussing. I probably like a lot of the same shit you guys do. I'm extremely laid back, and don't like being around high strung people.

I'm looking for a friend, first and foremost. Dating isn't something I have a lot of time for at the moment but I do realize sometimes things just happen. I'm open-minded and it'd be pretty tight-butthole if you were too. 

Seahorses forever.

I always wonder why men wont approach a woman in person and just ask them out? Is it fear that they'll be irrationally crazy?

Well I can tell you from experience that when I'm single I would like nothing more then for a handsome gentleman to approach me and ask me if I'd like to go out for coffee sometime. If they have a boyfriend, they'll tell you and either they'd love to get to know you as a friend or not at that point. Rejection? Is rejection really that bad if you could possibly meet a really nice, sweet girl that way? Also, going out for coffee isn't asking her to have drinks with you or come to your place, it's just a nice time to spend getting to know someone new. It's just nice social interaction. 

So men! I have a request from all of you! Next time you go out and see someone that catches your eye in a certain amazing way, talk to her, take a chance! Maybe you'll eventually you'll ask me out.

A very long time ago (by reddit standards), I was living in Damascus, Syria and I was looking for travel buddies or people to meet up with as I travelled around the country/region. I made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/e9z5d/w4m_tldr_kinder_eggs/) here on r4r on the off-chance that someone interesting might get in touch.

Well, someone did. He described his hometown (a big Middle Eastern city in a neighbouring country) with equal parts love and frustration, and something about the sincerity of what he said immediately piqued my interest. He was 25 to my 23, and seemed intelligent and friendly. I eventually added him on gchat under my real name, and we talked fairly frequently over the next few months - we discussed literature (a lot - he's a writer), politics, his shitty job and my language course, talked about plans for the future and argued fiercely about music.

Early on in the new year a classmate told me that she had been wanting to visit my new friend's home city for some time, and suggested that we travel there together on our week off. I said yes, and the prospect of meeting my online friend definitely had something to do with that.

I don't think I'm misremembering when I say that looking at his face for the first time, hearing his voice (deep and slightly raspy, with an accent ten times more attractive than I'd bargained for) changed everything for me. Before meeting him I'd treated him a bit like a younger brother. After meeting him, that never happened again.

I met up with him 4 times during that week. On the second occasion, we got drunk and he kissed me and I stayed the night.

I can't really explain it, reddit. I'm a level-headed girl - I focus on my career and have always been happy being single. Falling in love wasn't something I ever really thought about. What was it about him? I've asked myself that over and over again. He's very intelligent and incredibly talented, that's for sure. He was infinitely patient with me, and when I'd say anything arrogant or condescending (it's one of my bigger character flaws) he'd laugh and like me *more* for it. Under a grouchy and misanthropic exterior, he was a kind person who liked taking care of others. And he loved me.

I went back to Syria, but not long after that Bashar al-Assad started murdering his population and I had to leave. In the (in hindsight obviously vain) hopes that the situation would blow over, I decided to visit my friend and wait it out there. So in early April of 2011 I flew to his city. I stayed a month. I'm not sure I've ever been happier. 

But by then I already knew I'd be starting a new job in September of that year, in Africa, and in the meantime my parents wanted me home. I promised to return in June, and then in August. I was determined to make it work.

A lot more happened before I finally realized this, but: it didn't. It still shocks me sometimes that two people can love each other so much and still fail to make it work (that is hopelessly naive, I suppose). It was a combination of things, as ever: my career destroys relationships; he was struggling with the combination of depression and being broke, and too proud to let me help with either.

He turned 28 a few days ago. I will be 26 next month. We haven't spoken in a few months, and after all the upheaval and reversals of the last few years, I truly hope that this time it's permanent. It's not going to work. It just isn't.

Thank you, r4r (I mean that sincerely). I wouldn't have had it any other way. I never imagined I could love someone so much. It was both the greatest privilege and the greatest pleasure of my life.

Thank you for taking part in this short social experiment. As per general ethical guidelines in regards to research and deception used in that research, I'm admitting to my deception and will come clean about the nature of this research. I'm a college student, and this has been done for a term paper in a sociology course. The parameters of the paper were approved by my professor.
   
   
The nature of the situation put forth to the public (career woman in late 20's, presumably able to support herself, seeks male to have a baby with) was to see if the reaction would be different than that of a woman who accomplishes the same task via artificial insemination. Reddit was used for the testing location, as the nature of the website and the internet allows for anonymous responses, which, ideally, will lead to more truthful opinions. Initial responders were replied to by either myself or my friend helping me with the study in hopes of adding legitimacy to the offer, but we were quickly overwhelmed by the number of responses and chose instead to remain silent.


Note that if you responded, none of your information, including username, photos, personal information, social networking accounts (ie Facebook, okcupid, etc) has been saved nor will be used in the purpose of this study. Your participation has remained completely anonymous.


The data breaks down as follows:


**Private Messages**
These are messages that were sent directly to the presumed poster. Positive messages were either those looking to pursue the offer presented, or offering support to the poster. Negative messages were those expressing disgust or anger at the poster, trying to persuade the poster to reconsider, or those claiming illegality of the offer. Neutral messages were those asking for clarification, asking general questions to understand the situation better, or simply expressing doubt towards the scenario. PMs that included demographic information about the person (age, location, body type, etc) were counted as Legitimate Offers. PMs that included either links to a photo, or links to a site containing photos of the person were counted under Messages w/ Photos. Skeptical messages were those that expressed outright doubt towards the legitimacy of the offer.


**Total # of PM's** (counts only each unique pm'er): **113**

* Positive: **99**

* Negative: **7**

* Neutral: **7**

* Legitimate Offers: **87**

* Messages w/ Photos: **34**

1371444560.0,67,self.r4r,1ghw7a,[meta] Do you have trouble connecting to people? Getting the internet cold shoulder far too often? Welcome to relationships 101,djeinstine,81,14,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1ghw7a/meta_do_you_have_trouble_connecting_to_people/,"I have spoken to many people on r4r here looking for friends to talk to, but the biggest thing that yanks my chain is that relationships seem to fail before they even begin. I've also seen a lot of comments on this matter of (mainly) guys feeling abandoned so quickly. With that said, lets begin.

Most of us have have been on the receiving end of the cold shoulder or are guilty of  it - I am no exception. There are a variety of reasons why someone will just stop talking to you out of the blue. The internet, especially reddit, is a safe haven in that kind of way: If you don't like them just stop talking to them. 

Here in this little discussion I want to focus on what I feel to be the main reason why someone gives the cold shoulder. Before I go on, I would like to link this lovely article on conversations from [lifehacker.com](http://lifehacker.com/5937348/use-the-ford-technique-to-make-small-talk-easier) (which incidentally links to the subreddit LPT by the way)

_____________________________________________

Lets begin:

**You haven't done your part**

Yes, believe it or not, any form of a relationship is a two way street. *You* have to put in effort. The biggest trend I see here is that relationship solicitors tend to believe that their responder has to hold most, if not all, of the conversation. After the initial greetings, it feels so difficult to maintain fluidity of the conversation. I am not saying I am some expert conversationalist but there are certain key things in a person's response that will help me converse with them. Lets look at these examples:

**Example 1**
&gt;**Person1:** Hey how is life going over there in &lt;Xlocation&gt;? Are you working or going to university?

&gt;**Person2:** Not bad. I'm working part time at a library.

**Example 2**
&gt;**Person1:** Hey how is life going over there in &lt;Xlocation&gt;? Are you working or going to university?

&gt;**Person2:** Life is pretty good! I can't complain really. I'm working part time at a library but it's only to help me get on my feet to reach my bigger goal of eventually owning my own bookstore. I really love reading and books in general! How about you? What do you do?

In Example 1, Person 2 didn't really say anything wrong. Person 1 asked two questions question and Person 2 answered. However as you can see in Example 2, Person 2 also answered the same questions, but they also elucidated a few facts about themselves which can be used as talking points for Person 1. Also they asked Person 1 about their life **showing interest.** 

Showing interest in someone can make a big difference in the flow of the conversation. Even if you aren't completely interested in them, show some interest and eventually you may find things in common you would never have expected. Try to avoid short responses and/or one liners. Even if you can't think of anything to say, there is always something to say. Read between the lines, look at previous posts or even change the topic altogether if you're that stuck.

I emphasize this point a lot because unfortunately, I get many responses like Example 1 far too often. I don't want to go around pointing fingers and blame people for lack of interest. Perhaps the person does not get a great deal of social interaction. Perhaps to someone nothing at all is wrong with a response like Example 1. However I will say that when you respond like Example 1, regardless of the reason, I feel like you don't even care about the conversation and are just shooting back responses like blank bullets. This is a fast way to make the conversation a one way street or get a cold shoulder.


This brings me to another point, try to talk about everything in that person's message. If someone is talking about three different things, prepare three different paragraphs. I really don't like it when I mention multiple things trying to find some sort of common ground only to have a one liner about the last thing I mentioned. Maybe they couldn't relate to anything I said, or even didn't understand them but that shouldn't stop them from giving at least two sentences on each one.

Remember the goal here is to find common ground that both of you can reach. Sometimes common ground is right there, or you may have to search deep for it but both parties have to be willing to try.

_____________________________________________

 In the link above the author mentions FORD, you don't necessarily have to use that order because I personally find it a little invasive talking about someone's family right off the bat unless it came up naturally somehow. In my experience it usually goes ORD and F pops up anywhere in between. 

There are many subtleties here I would like to discuss but I have purposefully not laid everything out on the table. I don't know if this will ever get upvoted but I'm just hoping this little article can improve the quality of this subreddit even by a little or at least incite some healthy discussion.

You remember [this thing](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1jai76/meta_r4r_cupid_results_and_ama/), right?  I mean, this post *was* made only **2 days** ago...

It looks like a lot of people didn't get paired, mostly because what they were looking for may have been too specific.  I don't blame any of this on IAsub.  He did the best he could with what he had, and we all know that 40+ thousand subscribers spread across the planet may not always be close in proximity to each other.  Then when you account for exactly what people want, it's even harder to get a decent connection.

WELL, this may serve as a second chance for those of you kinda bummed about not finding somebody to hang out or talk with.  Or maybe you tried to connect to the person you were matched with and either didn't get an answer or it was evident that it wasn't going to work out.  Whatever happened, feel free to post here!  Oh, and if you thought that maybe your requirements were too strict the first time around, consider loosening them up a bit.

Here are some things you should consider posting.  Since privacy is important and this is no place for controversy, go ahead and add/remove whatever is best for you:

* what kind of connection you're looking for (M4W, W4M, R4R, etc // skype buddies, gaming buddies, casual dating, long-term potential, fwb, etc etc)

* your location

* how far you're willing to travel

* your age

* age range preferences

* physical characteristics you're looking for

* your physical characteristics

* your hobbies and interests

* some of your favorite movies, tv shows, video games, sports, outdoor actives, magazines, etc etc

* life philosophy/belief system

If you're looking for dates, but don't mind making long-distance friendships, that's cool.  Just mention it.

Consider saving this post and returning to it periodically over the next few days.  What you're looking for may not appear right away.

It seems any male submissions are usually downvoted, I just don't understand why this would happen in a subject neutral subreddit(there's very little to agree/disagree with even though that's not the purpose of the downvote/upvote button). The upvoting/downvoting does very little since those who are looking for a specific regional location are going to find the submission anyway. It just seems unneedlessly mean sometimes when guys are just average good looking guys.

At the same time, female submissions are upvoted and celebrated. Which is GREAT! I understand that they're rarer, but even ones that say something disagreeable that would be downvoted if you were a male are upvoted.

For example, I've noticed many female threads propositioning males for a hookup, these are usually the top upvoted threads with dozens of comments, puns, jokes, etc.

But when a male makes a thread propositioning females for a hookup, he is not only downvoted but belittled, insulted, and called a creep. Wtf?

I think we're all adults here guys. We all are interested in the opposite sex. It's not ""bad."" It's not ""wrong"" If it's consensual than its all kosher. I think this is holding r4r back.

I just have a thing for skinny smart guys who play board games, but I have been attracted to lots of different guys and girls. I am not looking for a relationship (I have one with a guy who is completely supportive of my sexuality). I do use a wheelchair to get around and my legs and arms are weak but I am sexually fully functional and very creative ;-).  I am not desperate (I have sex daily) but I am kinky and filled with lots of slutty fantasies I would like to start playing with in reality. I have pics to share. 

**Edit** - So I thought the wheelchair thing would end up being a deal breaker and this post would get buried. I already have a dozen messages [very excited!]. I'll come back after lunch and answer each one - I hope I find some playmates.

**Edit 2** - Tons of messages and I replied to most of them. Some feedback I have (and I am not trying to be snarky - just honestly give feedback). The people who sent me pics got pics back right away. If you asked me for something like cam sex (which I am not in to) I appreciated the direct request and let you know if I was in to it or not. People who wrote nice notes describing themselves got more info about me and maybe a pic. If you just wrote ""send me pics"" or ""I'm interested"" it wasn't much to go on for me to figure out if **I** was interested so the exchange basically stopped right there.

Just to place a caveat - I have messaged the mods and they have agreed (with lovely enthusiasm) that this can be posted on here.

I'm intending to create a dating website that only focuses on people's flaws. There are a lot of dating websites out there that tend to follow a very strict format: Make yourself seem as great as possible and hopefully someone will dig it.

Sometimes it works - often, however, it doesn't.  By only focusing on user's flaws, I think this site will nurture a more honest, authentic and ultimately successful dating environment. 

A standard profile will include a short bio, a picture (if the user wants) and then a list of flaws. However many they want. Personally, I think the flaws in someone are what defines them most. This website would be about acknowledging that none of us are perfect, so rather then pretending that we are, we should embrace it and look for people that like us in spite of our flaws. Perhaps even **because** of our flaws.

I basically just wanted to ask how you guys would feel about this. Is it something you could see yourself signing up for? Would you trust this kind of format more? Personally, I think it will lend itself to a more self aware, less superficial kind of person, who can acknowledge their own flaws whilst seeing the beauty in other people's.

Comments, criticisms, compliments and complaints will be all be appreciated if expressed politely!

If the ad is about meeting up, and you have no intention of ever meeting up, then why go through all that and waste everyone's time. Is it an attention thing? So you could feel better about yourself? I feel like we're being used for attention, it's not nice.


I've met 2 redditors on r4r, things went great and fun was had by both parties and we still keep in contact, but I've made COUNTLESS submissions and spoken to a ridiculous amount of ""interested"" users. I've spent extensive time on r4r so this is something I can say from experience.

An hour later, when I was feeling a lot better, the cops showed up. The hotline had called the police and sent 2 cars to my house. They made my mother come home from work, and made me talk to a social worker. My dad didn't find out until today because he was away on business and not answering his phone or email. He called me, screaming, threatening to ""throw my pathetic ass out of the house and give me something to cry about."" I have nowhere else to go if it gets bad. He has never struck me, but he says some pretty mean shit and i am legitimately afraid of him. I don't have my license and I don't have a car, I don't have a job.

Recently there has been an influx of posters putting messenger info and phone numbers in their posts. Although the mods here at r4r have not as of yet put in the sidebar officially that this is not allowed, we have come to the decision that it may not be the best idea for a few reasons. For one, we have no way to verify that the person posting the information is in fact the owner of that phone number or messenger name. Although we can't do anything if you give that information out in a message, we can assure that no ones information is being given out on r4r without their permission. So from this post on, we will be deleting any post that has a messenger names or phone number in it. It's fine for you to make a post still if you want to exchange such information, but please refrain from putting it in the body of your post.


Secondly, and this is just to help make the community better for everyone, if you see a comment or post that you feel may be malicious or someone trolling, do not hesitate to press the report button! There's only a few of us mods and almost 30,000 of you! (whoa!) It helps us out a lot and helps make r4r a community effort.


**In short: No phone numbers or messenger names in the body of your post. Also, use the report button if you feel like something is inappropriate or malicious.**

I'm Saskia, I'm 22, Scottish and I *really like ladies*. Not 100% sure, yet, whether I swing more towards 'bi' or 'lesbian' as I've not been blessed with much experience in life. Cue: violins!

I live in a mountainous pass and there're not many folk living near me. So I'm a bit shy and quite lonely, although the scenery makes up for it. Quite short, long brown hair, average body (if you like curves, bonus, although I wouldn't say I was 'fat' as I do run five times a week). 

Big fan of guitar-led alt rock, walking dogs in the heath and machair, travel (who isn't?!) and comforting milkshakes from Costa. I also love immersing myself in a book and tickling people... :P

So what am I after? New friends. Email pals. Confidants. Girls who're maybe keen to blush a little with some saucy PM swappage... I don't know?!

I'll cut right to the interesting stuff. I'm a college student about to graduate and go into the armed forces.  I'm 5'8"" and lean built. I'm very Irish, so I'm pretty pale.  I have chocolate brown hair and a small goatee.  My eyes are blue and I prefer glasses over contacts.  I like just about everything; movies, video games, music, pistol and rifle marksmanship. I pretty much do it all(why I never had time to pursue more than a few relationships).

I've had a 2 year run of being way too busy with school for a relationship and am now realizing in this late hour that I may have squandered my college years. I'm not ugly be any means nor am I some creepy sex perv, it's just that I have had too many responsibilities to engage in romantic activities. I have some experience from the few short lived relationships I've had (I love going down on girls) and I've basically done everything but sex. I don't want to give my self to just anyone though, I want to get to know the person interested well enough to trust them with my body and my feelings. If you would like this to turn into a relationship, I am entirely game for that. If you just want a one time thing that's cool.  If you want a long term friends with benefits, that's cool too. If you would like more information, please PM me soon and get to know me.

Where did this all come from? Why was there only 1 girl and like 15 guys?  Why do magnets work the way they do? None of this is making any sense.

This is probably going to sound weird, but I've had a long-standing fantasy to hook up with a guy who, despite being a decent person and precociously funny and smart, can't get anywhere with girls. Young, possibly still in high school **(BUT STILL 18+)** or just starting uni, hopefully a virgin. Think Superbad, Inbetweeners, etc. I love watching Inbetweeners and fantasizing about taking one of the boys and ""helping him out,"" so to speak (not Neil, though, he seems to do fine with the girls and is a bit too dumb, anyway). 

I'm 26 and attractive. I'm slender/toned with large breasts and long hair. Since I am a real girl and not a Dahmer-esque psycho looking to prey on young boys from the internet, I can't just post my pics or hand them out willy-nilly, so I'd love to correspond a little bit and get a feel for each other before exchanging photos. We can video chat before meeting up (somewhere public, obviously); meeting people from the internet is obviously a gamble so I'd like to try to do it as sensibly as possible. Anywhere in Australia or New Zealand. I don't really care much what you look like, so don't worry about that.

I'm in a happy relationship with someone so I'm not looking for a boyfriend (he knows about my doing this and, as a guy who had a lot of trouble with girls himself, fully supports it). If anybody out there is interested and not totally creeped out by this, please let me know!

1309776149.0,56,self.r4r,igb5k,[r4r] 23 year old female recently diagnosed with serious disease looking for one or two supportive new friends with similar interests and perspectives on life.,Lunatickled,64,8,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/igb5k/r4r_23_year_old_female_recently_diagnosed_with/,"Hi! I'm a really particular person. I like to think that I'm a complicated and unique individual with positive characteristics. I have some strong interests, such as different sciences, the state of the world, humanity, religion, reality, life, and people. Kind of hard to summarize, but I guess what I'm trying to communicate is that I enjoy all kinds of conversation and sharing of ideas. I'm a big fan of TED talks especially and I enjoy all different kinds of arts.

In the past, I've been the kind of person to keep to myself and have found it trying to make new friends. Now, with recent events in my life, I realize that there are all kinds of caring and genuine people out there that I would do well connecting with and I've come to the conclusion that those positive human connections are the spice of life. I want to keep growing as a person and sharing my thoughts and feelings with my fellow human beings, appreciating this experience of life together.

Just for some background, this year has been a hell of a game changer for me. In the beginning of the year, I was diagnosed with a particularly bad case of Lupus which has aggressively destroyed my kidney function in 6 months. I'm a 23 year old female and the last thing I expected was to become so ill at this point in my life. The odds of my getting this somewhat rare disease were 1 in 10,000.

My kidneys failed 2 weeks ago and since then my life has been a blur of life changing events. Without having any time to emotionally process my experience, I was forced to decide what kind of surgery to get in order to have dialysis access because now that my kidneys have failed, I'm no longer able to filter my own blood. Unreal. I was given very little time to make the decision and am now emotionally dealing with the fact that I'm a cyborg, with an implant for Peritoneal Dialysis sticking out of my abdomen.

As if this wasn't enough, after having the surgery, (the first in my life), the next day after leaving the hospital, the Lupus flared worst than it ever has before and attacked my entire body, including my brain, causing me 6 grand mal seizures. I ended up in the ICU for days, almost dying, had I not been saved by massive doses of steroids. This happened last Sunday. I experienced short term memory loss and had to rebuild my sense of self and strength over the next couple of days.

I've been in the hospital the entire time. I'm posting this from the wifi there right now. Hopefully, I'll be able to go home this week after my surgery has healed enough. I have a treatment plan and good doctors and am determined to beat this disease and learn how to live in a new way. But everything is different. All my perspectives have inevitably changed. My thoughts and feelings on all my past life experiences have taken on new meaning. The friends and family I have have blown my mind with the love and support they offer. Even the medical system has amazed me with the number of compassionate people I've met through my disease. Everything is different now. I don't want to take life for granted any more and I want to make the best of life, appreciating all there is that is precious and good. Something about having a near death experience can remind you of that.

So, here's the deal. I'm at a really significant point in my life. Everything is taking on new meaning. I'm on an emotional roller coaster ride and what I'm looking for is a small number of genuine people to connect with. I do my best to be a caring and authentic individual. I really value the friendships I have, though they are few. And to be honest, I don't necessarily click with most people. I decided to put my long winded story of what's been happening in my life lately because I figured that would be the best way to communicate the kind of wavelength I'm looking for in other people. I figure, I can reveal myself and my nature, and you, the reader, should be able to determine if you can relate to me and leave a comment if you think we might have a meaningful connection and maybe, just maybe, I can form a new friendship or two through this post and we can both benefit.

Peace and Love.

I do have something to offer, but it's not money, since that isn't allowed in this sub reddit (it'll be mentioned here, and if you'd rather something else you have in mind, I will definitely consider).

Like the title says, I want to find a lesbian couple who might be up for making something happen that just doesn't happen. Basically, it's a fantasy that I hope to come true.

I'm white, decent looking and very athletic/toned. 5'9"". I'm disease-free, clean and groomed. A decent, genuine, honest and loyal person, and easy to get along with. From Toronto but definitely willing to travel for the right couple!

Bi women are okay too, but for some reason I would prefer two lesbian women who, aren't necessarily grossed out by a penis but, will sort of have to force themselves to do something they don't want to in order to help another person fulfill his fantasy! Yeah, the thought of that turns me on too for some reason. It's okay if you have never given a blowjob as well, as any blowjob is a good blowjob, especially from two women at once haha!

I have been trying to think of what I could offer in return, and what I had originally thought is just to get a nice hotel room maybe with a hot tub or something, and when we're done with the 'encounter,' I will leave you guys to have the room to yourselves for the rest of the night/morning to enjoy and maybe throw some room service in there for you. But for two people to go out of their way this much in order to fill some strangers fantasy, that doesn't even begin to make things even!

So I am totally up for considering other ideas, if you have any.

I am also willing to reciprocate (would love to, actually) on top of whatever else, if you've never been with a man and just wondering what it would be like or something? Haha. Keep dreaming, huh? Though I may not be able to match the amount of pleasure you guys would give each other, I am still pretty good with the cunnilingus, and who knows, maybe you'll get off on the thought of how 'not right' this would be too.

I chatted with a very cute, bespectacled vegetarian girl Redditor from Wisconsin for several minutes before I had to leave because a family member was calling for me. If you're out there, you were wearing a blue shirt (if I recall correctly), and you have short black hair.

We talked about you being a vegetarian and what that entails, my love of bacon, and your culinary skills (you told me that you could make a mean plate of scrambled eggs, which I loved). Shortly after this, our conversation was unfortunately cut short. 

I would love to continue our conversation over Skype or whatever, so if you're interested, please free to PM me. Thanks! :)

**UPDATE**: 

I actually found her again on Omegle Video soon after I made this post! This has been a true R4R success story - we talked for over a hour on a great variety of topics. It was a fascinating, fun, intellectually stimulating conversation, and we plan to keep in touch.

1343381700.0,54,self.r4r,x8o4i,"Yes, there are far more women than men on r4r. Yes, your chances of finding a match are small. No, complaining about it does not improve the odds.",,89,35,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/x8o4i/yes_there_are_far_more_women_than_men_on_r4r_yes/,"Copied and pasted from a comment I wrote up. It's a fairly complex analysis of the social dynamics of r4r... and it's both exceedingly long and likely confusing, so I don't expect much of an audience. Still, -someone- might find this particular meta-discussion interesting so here goes nothing.

I'm stating a very simple fact.

If you perform an action and do need receive the desired results, there are two courses of action you can take.

1: Get better at performing the action such that the results improve  
2: Do not expect such great results

You'll notice that there is no ""3: Complain"". Life isn't fair, and the fact that it's hard to get a response (let alone a full conversation) out of a girl on r4r is an accurate reflection of that. It comes down to sheer statistics. 

Hypothetical time: Let's say that 50% of F4M posts end in a 'match' and that the average F4M post gets 10 responses indicating interest. The numbers are more or less irrelevant as long as you operate under the fairly evident assumption that girls get lots and lots of messages. That means that for every 20 messages sent from males to females, 1 of them will successfully accomplish a 'match'. A 5% success rate is pretty fucking bleak. Except for those redditors in major metropolitan areas (and, it seems, New Jersey) there can be days and weeks in between posts from local girls, and then you have to cross your fingers and pray that the stars align such that you both have chemistry AND you messaged early enough/stood out enough from the other replies that she chose to pursue a more meaningful connection with you over the other dozen suitors filling up her inbox.

I'm not implying that there's anything wrong with you. Far from it. I'm saying that when it comes to online dating the deck is rigged against you and I, and that's just a fact of life we have to get used to. Even handsome, charming, witty, educated, loaded guys (of which I'm sure there are several) can have trouble finding girls in a place like r4r because the odds are perpetually in the lady's favor.

How many local F4M posts do you see on a daily basis? 1 if you're lucky, maybe 2-3 if you live in LA or SF or NYC sound like a fair estimate? Now consider the sheer volume of messages this average post is receiving. A girl who's posted several times on r4r might be able to give you an accurate number, but I'd guess it's at least double digits on average which means that it might be weeks or months for the average poster messaging every single local girl on the offchance that there will be chemistry there before he can expect to make a match.

I could also go into detail as to why the odds are stacked against the average male (because the exceptionally attractive 'outliers' are likely to be recycled back into the dating pool over time) or attempt to explain why not making a match is not necessarily a bad thing (it means that when you DO make a match that you were the most attractive of the potential suitors to the lady in question and that leads to strong chemistry and a greater likelihood of longer-term success) but I doubt any significant number of people will read and/or understand what I'm trying to get at. I understand that this post is probably fairly abstract and I'm prone to rambling and using big words but hopefully it's at least a little helpful in conveying the basic message.

**tl;dr the odds of finding a match on r4r are drastically weighted against the M4F demographic. The 2 main factors that you can change to increase your chances are 'quantity of messages sent' (relative to the number of local F4M posts) and 'quality of messages sent' (determined by the rate of reply; includes things such as your attractiveness), but the far bigger factors at play are time and luck, which you ostensibly cannot change. By tweaking your reddit settings to filter out M4X posts, you reduce the amount of time spent per message sent which means that if the time you can spend on r4r per day is less than the time it would take to scroll down the list of every single new post + the time spent sending messages, it's increasing the total number of messages you can send and therefore improving your chances at receiving a fitting response.**

***tl;dr the tl;dr I am a verbose motherfucker. Life isn't fair. Girls can be picky when they have their choice of the litter. Nothing you can do will change the nature of women or the population demographics of r4r, therefore the only thing you CAN change is yourself. Which brings us full circle: either get better by writing really good introduction messages, or understand that you're unlikely to get a response for the majority of messages you send and be okay with it. Complaining about it is pointless. Life does not have a customer service department. There is no ""Were you satisfied with your service?"" survey at the end of the meal. Don't be surprised if you can't get no satisfaction, because you can't always get what you want.***

So after moving in with my parents who live in a different state after graduating from college, I haven't really made a single friend in almost 2 years of living with them.  I had a part-time job as an SAT tutor after moving here but that's now gone.  Didn't make a single friend.  Tried asking out 2 different girls who worked there, one turned down immediately, other one said yes then turned down a few days later before the date.  Ouch.

Aside from that, I'm not really an outside person as you could probably guess.  Just your average computer gamer (currently doing the Diablo 3 thing).  An indoors night owl.

So, The Dark Knight Rises comes out this weekend and I really want to see it.  However, I have *zero* RL friends in Maryland.  Most of my RL friends are still back in the state where I went to HS and college.  In an effort to finally get myself out of the house for something than a grocery store trip, I am taking a long shot in the *dark* (get it?) by asking ANYONE to go see The Dark Knight Rises with me.  I don't care if you're a guy or a girl.  Just please be somewhat around my age (I'm 24) so we can hopefully have something in common to talk about during the previews.

I live in the Catonsville/Ellicott City area in Maryland.  I'm free the whole weekend.  I don't smell bad.

So let's just get straight to the points. We, the Men, make a crap load of posts here. We don't get much responses, comments nor upvotes. We get happy when you (a Woman) finally does message us. Said messaging goes back and forth some. Some subtle flirts are thrown about. A wild smiley face appears. Then it happens. 

You stop messaging us. Every single time. No excuse, no formal explanation of non interest, nothing. You dump or choose to ignore us, and you don't realize that sometimes it's upsetting. Now don't get me wrong here, i'm in no way a softie. All i'm asking for is some dignity and mutual respect. If you don't like us anymore, no problem. Don't like the way we look? That's fine too, just let us know so that we don't over think into what we did wrong. 

We're already on here because we feel like we'd mesh better with a redditor, so there's no need to take that final hope away from most of us. 

And to the ladies that do indeed already do this, stay classy. We really appreciate it, and wish you the best. 

Edit* Strong white knights in this thread. 

Edit2* Oh my goodness, this thread has evolved into something much more than I had expected. A couple of points though: 
I don't need therapy (thanks for the offer). Some people here (both men and women) are going very hard on their criticisms, like the comment I just mentioned. I'm an adult, I approach women in real life and can hold a conversation freely, without any feeling of need. The specific situation I was referring to was when messaging goes back and forth, around 10 times, details are given to each other, and then it flat out dies without any explanation. Especially when (in my case) a Woman says ""i'll get back to you on that point tomorrow"" or ""We should definitely do that!"" then never messages you again.

Quite frankly, some of you (both men and women) need to get your heads out of your butts, but hey that's just my opinion.

Before all you guys start down voting me and ridiculing me for even asking. Hear me out.

When I was 11 years old I had discovered my dad's porn. I spent many hours sneaking to that old file cabinet just to take a peak at the collection of playboys. If I wasn't jerking off, I was playing my guitar or listening to kiss and acdc. One day I had came across a section in a magazine that had some look a like rock n roll star having sex with two really Hott woman... It was glorious, I remember every position in that photographs. Anyways to make. Long story short I started a band when I got my first guitar around 12 practiced for hours and hours. My goal in life was to have a threesome with two sexy Girls. Over the course of  17 years playing rock shows, touring, and having girl friends I've never come close... This is part of my bucket list and I want to make this happen. So reddit, is there a foxy set of ladies that want to rock with me?

TL;DR started a rock band for a threesome years later... No rock band no threesome

I know some of you are going to say pay... Nope I will never do that for sex.... That goes against my moral and ethical values in the treatment of people.

Another slightly important note: I'm not a bad looking guy. I'm not sexy though. Let me explain, I've defiantly been with girls who are 8-10's and when we were out my friends and people around me would say things like ""she is out of your league."" I never believed it because I always felt sexier then I appeared to other people. However the 8-10's I use to date thought I was sexy, but I think my personality is what rocked their world. 

So... If there are two girls that want to help me on my birthday to make this happen I would greatly appreciate it. We can all go out and get dinner, drinks, a concert. Get to know each other. And if the mood is right then... Well then we can all have fun on my cake day while I get to cross off an item on my list.

Just PM if interested and I will exchange pics with you and you.

Hey there! I'm a 21 year old literally about to graduate college (this Saturday!) with a BA in Theatre Performance. I've been in quite a funk lately and want to get the heck out of it! :)


 I act, sing, write music, draw, paint, and generally love being creative. I play xbox (mainly l4d, l4d2, Mass Effect series, Half Life series, and Portal) and love DnD (I mostly play sorcerers). I like reading as well in addition to films! I'm sure there's more, but that's all I can think of for now. Pic in case you're interested in what I look like: [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/1X0lU.png)


EDIT: Located in SoCal, I may get more specific depending on where our conversation goes, haha.

~~EDIT 2: I'm going to go away for a bit tonight, I have a show performance I have to get to, but if you send me a message I'll get back to you as soon as I can! :) (Most likely tomorrow.)~~

EDIT 3: I just got home and will go through all my pms now, holy shit I got a fuckload, haha.

...And I'm off to bed for now. So sleepy! G'night!!

EDIT 4: HO-LY SHIT. This is a ton of freaking upvotes and pms. I'm sifting through all my pms right now, sorry if I don't reply to you, I promise I'm not being rude, I just have way too many to reply to everyone and still have time for my life. :/ I really appreciate all the good thoughts about living life and getting out of a funk, though! Thank you guys! &lt;3

**EDIT 8/22/12: I'm *still* getting messages from this, so I figure I'll save everyone some time and express that I'm no longer looking for anyone.

A few stuck around, and he was one of the few. Even after I made it clear that I wasn't looking for a relationship, and that he'd only ever be my friend, and that we couldn't even cuddle due to distance. I found myself spending all my free time talking to him, and truly enjoying it. Pretty soon, he was the first person I spoke to each morning, and the last I spoke to each night. So we decided that perhaps we should meet and see if the spark was there in real life. I've never blushed so hard in my life, as that first time I saw him in person. Everything felt so natural, so comfortable, as though we'd known each other forever. We had an amazing time together, and he'll be moving here at the end of the month.

Coincidentally, the age of consent is not the real issue here (although it is still a concern).

In the United States, minors (the US legal definition, circa 1995, states anyone under the age of 21 is a minor) have First Amendment rights seperate of their adult counterparts. The United States Supreme Court has labeled pornographic images as ""harmful to minors"" and has ruled that the regulation thereof is constitutional; see Ginsburg v. New York, 390 US 629 (1968) . This ruling comes under the greater umbrella of defining ""obscenity"", which is not protected by the First Amendment. Pornography itself is not considered obscene.

This regulation has been delegated to the states, and all states have legislated and codified that you must be at least 18 years old to view pornographic images (a select view have set that bar at 21). Most countries have also set 18+ as the age for viewing pornographic material, meaning that your countries age of consent might not match with the age of access to sexually explicit content.
Regardless of the laws of your respective country, we operate under the law of the United States. Period. There is no room for discussion on this. It is for the protection of everyone.

Occasionally on /r/r4r we get sexually explicit photographs and more often written posts. The legal definition of pornography is ""pictures and/or writings of sexual activity intended solely to excite lascivious feelings of a particularly blatant and aberrational kind, such as acts involving children, animals, orgies, and all types of sexual intercourse."" Which means some sexually explicit posting is also defined as pornography and is subject to the same laws.

It is our goal and our obligation to protect and uphold the laws under which we operate. We expect and appreciate your full cooperation in this endeavor to keep everyone safe and keep our community a legal, happy, and exciting place. This means reporting any posts you see made by minors and not marketing towards minors.

I got a lot of interest in the thread and via PM (you wouldn't believe...) about the results of the R4R cupid matching I volunteered to do last week.  I thought I would make a quick results thread and then answer any additional questions y'all had about the process, the people, or the results.  Obviously your identities are all protected, so don't bother asking if that cute girl from /r/gonewild was a match for you (She wasn't. Isn't. Stahp). I am going to refrain from any exact numbers, but will give my best estimates. I am still working on a few more matches, but I think the bulk of my work is done. **So check out the info below and then AMA if you'd like!**

All the links are music I have included to help you get through the copious reading.
_______________________________________________________
I wanted to start by telling you about [my process.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLf2CO5V2mA)  It was not [glamorous](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RuxkqOg_jQ) or [scientific](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMWGXt979yg) by any means.  I fielded your PM, took the info you provided and manually entered it into a line on my spreadsheet.  I separated the sheet by region (US East, US West, and Foreign) and then separated again by gender for a total of 6 tabs that I could compare [side-by-side](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjNX_gayY1E). I would guess this took me about 30 hours total, but I was drinking for most of the data entry process on Wednesday and Thursday night, so I made it through somehow.

After my entries were set [in stone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbPxUxNtVR8), I [first](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVBoDx_1dTc) went down the list line by line and looked for basic compatibility. I started with people who wanted to meet someone in their area- these were easy, but also the most depressing. If you wanted an IRL relationship and didn't have a nearby match, I highlighted you blue (Geographic mismatch) and had to ignore you for the rest of the process.  There were SO MANY redditors who were awesome people that simply didn't have anyone near them submit an entry.  I had to ignore a few [Ryan Reynolds look-alikes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5aZJBLAu1E), and [girls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIb6AZdTr-A) that (were I a less moral man) I would have asked to move in with me on the spot.  The important thing to remember here is that no matter how eligible you may be, Reddit is worldwide and redditors are still [few and far between](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=338eKCOSEVQ). Especially those on /r/r4r.

After I sent out all the IRL pairs, I moved on to those of you who had asked for Skype buddies, chat friends, or just someone to talk to.  I had a lot of these requests, so again, I went line-by-line and did my best to pair those folks up.  Sadly, a lot of them didn't include a picture, and then requested that their match be as cute as they were.  I didn't feel good about matching a very eligible bachelorette who had reasonable expectations along with a gentleman who had no supporting documentation, even if they sounded like they may get along.  I reserved matching on these folks for couples whose descriptions were truly a fantastic match.  Just because both of you enjoy video games may be enough to strike up a conversation at a bar, but I didn't want to waste anyone's time by saying ""Oh...talk about [Skyrim](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-_g8NZr1tA) for 5 minutes. Good luck"".  While I may have missed out on a few mild friendships, I think I did a pretty good job pairing everyone who was largely compatible. 

As a final takeaway, I just ask everyone who didn't get paired to be mindful of how complex human relationships are.  Meeting someone in real life requires your brain to make a zillion infinitesimally small calculations about who they are and why you might get along.  (sidebar: I read exclusively non-fiction, and have been on a huge human relations kick lately.  If you've never read a book about making judgments and sizing people up, check one out sometime.  Humans are so goddamn fascinating.) Trying to pair two strangers with naught but a username, location, and maybe 100 words about what they think they want made me very nervous!  At the very least, if I got a few people together for [a nice date](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoUV5d09JZw), I'll be very pleased.  I'll be deleting my spreadsheet at the end of next week after I tie a few loose end couples together, so if you want your personal info back, please harvest it from our PM's.  I will not have access to ANY of your photos, usernames, or preferences after this.  I will not be going back through my PM's either, so don't ask! :) 

If you'd like to [be in touch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH3Q_CZy968) privately, feel free to PM me.  *I will* **not** *provide a post-mortem on why you weren't matched thought.

 * I said I would talk to any girl/guy! Just as friends! I still didn't get a match! - **I know.  Sorry.  Maybe you have odd interests.

I plan on hanging out with strangers and doing things solo. Why? Because fuck it. :)

So, I've decided on **NC, and DC** for this trip. If you're interested in knowing the exact dates I will be in these places PM me.  I really wanted to do something on the west coast but I'm going to wait until later in the year for that one because I'd like to spend more time out there. 

Anywho.. **Redditors of NC and DC.. PM me! Even if you're not up for hanging out, I'd still like to hear of any recommendations you have (sights, hotels, food, bars, etc., etc., etc..)!! If you would like to hang out for a weekend, day, hour, or minute.. even better! If you live somewhere completely different and are thinking of being spontaneous and meeting me in DC... let's do it!!**

My most prized/favorite games are Timesplitters, Silent Hill, Fatal Frame, Tekken,  Mortal Kombat, and many others. I also like to read, taking care of my many pets, stargaze, embark on random adventures, and recently I've been getting back into my old talent of writing and poetry, which I stupidly dropped due to my harsh self critiquing. 

Whom i hope to attract:
friendly, charismatic people who are open minded and like to laugh. If you're a cutie that's obviously a bonus! :P

First, there are my new friends. They are all so different and wonderful. Some I talk to more often than others, but I always look forward to my next exchange with each of them. Sometimes it's sharing funnies, and sometimes it's sharing the best (and worst) that happens in our lives. When I posted I thought I'd meet some interesting people to talk to and it would be cool. . . I didn't expect internet strangers to become important to me. 

One friend I met in person. He became a little more than a friend. There's not exactly a happy ending (not bad either, really) to us. However, in the time I've gotten to know him and spend time with him, I've grown to care about him immensely. I never expected that a silly, casual post on reddit would lead me to meet one of the most wonderful people to ever get wrapped up in my life. It was never my intention to get involved with one my friends from my post like this, but it happened. I wouldn't trade the experience for anything.

I'm reasonably comfortable with myself despite the flab, don't insist on wearing a shirt or turning off the lights when I have sex or anything like that, but if you want someone lean and mean, I'm not for you and likely never will be.
* I smoke. Both cigarettes and... other things, like green things. Eventually, I'll quit at least one of those, but I like to undertake Major Self Projects one at a time and I'm kind of tied up with the diet-and-exercise thing at the moment.
* I have kids, and they're with me half the time, which limits some of the time I have to devote to a social life when they're here and awake. I keep my family life and social life pretty strictly compartmentalized until I feel solid enough about someone's longevity in my life to feel comfortable mixing the kids in with my friends, so it would be a while before my kids would affect you except peripherally, as regards my availability when they're home. But some people hate kids, and if you're one of those people, I am not the droid you're looking for.

Now, on to the *good* things:

* I'm pretty smart, decently educated, and conversant in a fairly broad span of subjects.
* I'm funny. And my sense of humor is broad enough that unless you are completely humor-free, I'll probably find you funny.
* I'm nice. I try to be a kind, compassionate person while also not being a total goody two-shoes or dishonest.
* I give fantastic email and, usually, pretty good text. My friends seem to like hanging out with me, so I don't think I'm too shabby in person, either.
* I have some nerd cred. While I can't play a FPS to save my life, I like most of the reddit-approved shows, various sci-fi, comics, and computery stuff, and I speak pretty fluent meme (though not to a cringeworthy degree).
* I'm pretty. Yeah, sure, I'm a fatty, but I'm an *attractive* fatty.
* I'm not crazy. I'm not on any prescribed medications, I'm not in therapy, and I'm just plain not insane.
* I'm stable. Not as in ""not crazy,"" since I just told you that part, but like, my life is in pretty good shape and I don't have any major issues looming over me.

In no particular order, here are some things I like:

Cherry pie, photography, ST:TNG, The Princess Bride, Buddhism, botanical gardens, spring, water with lemon, sweet red wine, wineries, animals (though some more than others), writing, trivia, sitting out on the deck on a fine evening just shooting the shit, lavender, good grammar and usage, pop culture references that I may or may not get if you spring them on me, geology, Firefly, AD, science and history documentaries, cushy beds dressed with quality sheets, motorcycles, tattoos, Sedaris and Bryson, good beef and seafood, making digital art, gadgetry of almost any sort.

Here are some things I dislike, in no particular order:

Cilantro, sushi, Easter lilies, callous people and general assholes, chicken, people who don't own their issues, folding and putting away laundry, poor grammar and usage, Transitions lenses glasses.

Here is what I'm looking for:

* Someone local. I cannot be emphatic enough about this. I am *not* looking for a pen pal, I'm looking for someone to hang out with in person. 50-60 miles is about as big a distance as I want to deal with. **This is not negotiable.**
* Someone 35-50. **Also not negotiable.** I'm totally a MILF, but I am not a cougar.
* Someone honest, kind, just generally a decent person and all-around good egg. Not a doormatty, passive-aggressive Nice Guy (TM), but someone who values forthrightness and directness without being a gratuitous asshole.
* Someone smart. I don't care about your schooling, but I do care about your critical thinking skills.
* Someone progressive and not overly tied to religion of any sort. I'm not a traditionalist nor a conservative, and we probably won't like each other a whole lot if you are.
* Someone funny. Or, well, if you're not funny, at least be willing to laugh at my jokes. But try to be funny. I, like everyone else in the dating world, love to laugh. Snark and deadpan are welcome qualities.
* Someone confident. I don't so much dig arrogant assholes, but I love it when a guy  carries himself with an innate sense of comfort with both himself and his surroundings. 
* I don't really know that I'm looking for a boyfriend, but I don't know that I'm *not*. I guess that kind of depends on things that can't be determined until we talk to each other. **I am not looking for a fuckbuddy, booty call, or one-time hookup.** The ""F"" in FWB is nearly as important to me as the ""B"" part, though who doesn't like a good fuck? Still, we should be able to hang out and do not-naked things together without it being awkward or weird.
* I'm kind of into big, burly, hairy manly men (with modern progressive sensibilities and emotional availability). Think caveman looks, sensitive hippie attitude. By no means am I super-exacting about superficial things like weight and clothes and height and stuff like that, but I do like the big bear-like fellas, to a point.
* Some degree of kink, or at least open-mindedness, is highly desirable. I'm not a superfreak, but I'm not plain vanilla, either.

If you made it to the end of this without skimming (and you liked it), please PM me. I like men with attention spans and especially like a good rollicking correspondence leading up to an awesome first meet-up shortly thereafter, schedules permitting. If you give good PM (and especially like using your words rather than sending unsolicited penis pictures), and you liked this, I definitely want to hear from you.

So to cut a long story short, I'm at a new university in a huge city and I feel so god damn alone. I go to class, cross off the things on my to-do list, go for a run, come home and then spend hours on the internet. Nowadays I don't even go to class anymore because I can't be bothered with going to a place where half the people wouldn't notice my absence in the first place. I just feel like a ghost, constantly flitting in and out of campus, trying to get over the ""ordeal"" of a one hour lecture as best as I can. 

Well, it's not really an ordeal. That's way too melodramatic - it's just that I'm trying to keep my head down until 9:59am. Not because I'm antisocial, I LOVE TALKING, and I like most people on my course but because I'm too shy to talk to anyone because the conversation will inevitably trail off into schoolwork because, after all, I wasn't there on Saturday when so-and-so got white girl wasted and peed on the houseplant in dorms. The worst thing is that I've never been this lonely. I was pretty confident and well-liked in the past. I'm not even disliked or particularly unhappy right now, really, just completely and utterly unnoticed which gets to me a little. I feel like I have completely forgotten how to make friends!


Everyone sees me as the timid, shy girl who somehow gets A grades despite always getting the answer wrong when asked in class. I can't remember the last time I had a conversation that didn't start with *hey, did Professor N. say page 255 to 257?*

I finish the school year after Easter so there's no point trying to salvage anything (right now) but that means I'm left with the prospect of little social interaction from now until September 28th. My only respites being the library, the gym and the place I work. That's a shit ton of Saturdays and Sundays to spend with only my no good inner monologue for company. To stop myself from going crazy, I'd like to have an online friend of sorts to check in with once in a while. I'm not looking for any particular type of person as long as they are friendly and sociable. 

So, about me...

I like to read. A lot. Due to all my free time lately, I am averaging a book a day. And, due to being exceptionally whiny, I also like to write at length. Sometimes it's about my life or what I've eaten or what I plan to eat the next day. Other times it's stories that I've written at the back of class. Most of the time it's just endless drawings of wonky cuboids, though. Dancing is one of my favorite things (*is favoritest a word?*) and I'm part of a pretty cool dance society at college. It's one of the few places where I stop being Ghost Girl and act like my real self. I think that's it, eh. I don't have any other hobbies. I'd like to say that I'm adventurous and that I go for long walks in the countryside but it's fucking cold and I try to avoid practical clothes. I'm always open to trying new things, though. New books, new games, new movies, I'll probably try them all. Because I can. ಥ_ಥ


Okay, that was a bit dramatic. I feel pretty great now! Hopefully I'll get a few nice PMs but writing this all out helped.  Back to creeping on the hodgetwins.

I have really gained a lot of insight from this experience that I would like to share with you.
[I made an excel document to show what the responses were made up of.](http://imgur.com/ACCgi)
*A genuine response can be defined as someone looking to date or begin talking with someone as a potential love interest.*


**Insights to be gained from this information.**

* If you want to be taken seriously don't have a sex or alcohol related username.

* Don't message someone just to chat when they are not interested.

* Follow common courtesy and etiquette. Be straightforward. If you are interested in someone let them know, if you are not interested in someone let them know too.


**Advice for Men**

* Be confident. Start subscribing to Seddit or AskSeddit. They really are great resources for believing in yourself.

* Based on my statistics- most of the people that respond to a woman's post are just looking to chat or will flake out almost immediately. If you've exchanged numbers or any other type of information you are GOLDEN. GO GO GO and believe in yourself!

* Respond to more Women's posts and if she is taking you seriously make a lot of moves and be consistent.

* Don't be concerned with all the other men responding to her post. If she is talking to you, she is interested in you.

* What I couldn't get over the most was how many men I gave my number to or added on facebook didn't follow up or after seeing a picture was like ""no, im not interested"" or ""yes, I am"" there was just complete silence. Don't be one of those guys. Respond to everything. Be the person to say the last word.

* Wait to send a pic. I am vain, women are vain. Looks matter. If you are responding to a dating or relationship post let the woman get to know you first without a picture. I promise if you are not the most attractive person you will have a better chance of her meeting up with you.

**Advice for Women**

* Submit your own personal. I responded to two personals before I posted mine. Honestly, even though I only have managed to meet up with 2 men out of 38 it was kind of fun. Almost like shopping, I got to try on different guys and decide which one would fit me.

* Respond to all genuine messages. Don't leave anyone hanging. It's better to be upfront than not say anything at all.

* Know what you want and be direct about it.

* I had a process for my r4r responses that I really liked. After receiving a message from someone I would ask them 3 questions. At least one of them being ""What do you look for in the opposite sex?"" the others were related to the information they sent me. This allowed me to kind of weed out people I wouldn't be interested in.

**Age**: 20

**Location**: New York City

**Occupation:** University student, planning to pursue a PhD. 

**Appearance**: 5'7"" brunette of average weight. 

**Personality**: outgoing, talkative, friendly, ambitious. 

**Interests**: I enjoy traveling and my favorite places that I've visited are London, Beijing and Venice. I am interested in international politics as well as history. I read a lot of books on the subject of international politics, and am not that well-versed on American politics. I enjoy historical fiction as well. I know I really should finish GoT but I can't bring myself to read it after watching the show. 

**Music**: the xx, Snowpatrol, Green Day, Florence + the machine, Caught A Ghost, Electro Guest, Muse, Coconut Records, Cake, TMBG, Flying Lotus. 

**TV**: Game of Thrones, Suits, Lost, Mad Men, The West Wing, House of Cards, Downton Abbey, and a ton more. 


**What I am looking for:** 

A male, within the age range of 20-24 years old, located anywhere in the world. I'd like you to be passionate about something, it could be anything and I'd like you to share your passion with me. I want someone who is always learning and seeking to know more about the world. We can be friends, we can be skype buddies, or we can  be something more. I'm not opposed to meeting my soulmate on here, but there should be no expectations that we develop feelings. 

**Important detail**: I have never been in a significant relationship, and thus please do not message me if you're looking for something of a sexual nature right now.

I identify as pansexual (I know that word means different things to different people-- to me, it simply means I have been sexually attracted to people of all genders/orientations), and I'm looking for some open-minded people near the Springfield, MO area. 

I would like to create a small group of people who can all get together and have fun. I need everyone who responds to be confident and comfortable with their sexuality, as there will be all types of people in attendance if I can really get this going how I'd like. It would essentially be like a friends-with-benefits situation, but imagine it with a group of about 6-8 people. We could all get together for drinks/conversation, but then we'd all...well...fuck each other. It could be like we subgroup into couples and threesomes, or if we all are mutually attracted to one another, we could have group sex. 

This is something I've wanted to do for a while, but don't really know how to go about organizing it. And people in Southwest Missouri tend to not be the most open-minded. So, here I am.

I personally am a ""BBW"" (Big Beautiful Woman for those not familiar with the term. It means I am fat. I love myself and I'm okay with that, so if you are interested in this scenario, you need to not have any hangups about weight. I'm not looking for a bunch of supermodels, just real people with open minds who would like to have fun with one another and fulfill some fantasies/please each other).

If you are interested, please be: 

* Somewhere between the ages of 21-35ish

* Completely disease free

* Very conscientious of your personal hygeine

* Open-minded and comfortable with your sexuality


Please feel free to ask any questions you have in the comments, and I will answer them to the best of my ability. If you live in Springfield, Missouri or the surrounding areas and are legitimately interested in becoming part of this group, please send me a private message.

I'll get straight to the point, and talk about what I'm looking for with this post. I'd like to meet some new people, maybe we'll become friends or maybe something more. Age-wise, I'd prefer no older than 24, just because we'd be at different points in our life. I'd love to meet someone who can be intellectually stimulating, and hilarious too. We can talk about anything and everything, and have great witty conversation. Location doesn't matter at all, and accents are great! Maybe you can even teach me another language. 

For a basic description of my appearance, I'm a 5'7"" pale brunette. 

I am a 19 year old college student, currently on winter break. I'm studying international relations, with a concentration in the middle east. In the future, I'd like to pursue a PhD but who knows, I still have time to decide on all of that. 

I like listening to Cake (obvi), Empire of the Sun, the xx, They Might Be Giants, Awolnation, Neutral Milk Hotel, Interpol, Two Door Cinema Club, Florence + the machine, Snow Patrol, and Muse. 

I love watching tv shows and am currently getting through The West Wing, and have just finished the first season of Breaking Bad. I love both shows. I also watch Game of Thrones, but haven't really gotten through the books yet. 

The last movie I saw was Lincoln, and it was great, kinda predictable with that ending though. The last book I read was The Shah which I loved. I like history a lot, and love learning new things. Teach me stuff! I'm trying to memorize all the nations in the world right now, and I just finished reading up on the lost cosmonauts. 

I have previously posted on r4r before, with this same title around 4 months ago. I deleted that post after I decided to stop responding to messages. If I sound familiar, I probably am but you can always give it another shot.

Tragically, I say all this and I'm not even hot, more like that cute chubby girl that's not your first choice, but she's but good in bed and kinky as shit. Something like that.

I hate myself desperately, but I like to think I have enough perspective and Frequent Flyer miles at the psych wards to make suicide jokes instead of suicide threats. Subtle difference. 

Like most of you, I too am emotionally damaged and socially crippled, so as much as I'd like to say, ""Meet me at X bar, I'll be the one drinking Jack and Diet Coke, and if I've had enough you can touch my boobies,"" I'd rather correspond first before we get to that level.

I'm well over six foot, about 190 pounds, well built, tattoos, dark hair and eyes, and I like to think I'm somewhat good looking. I'm also not crazy or into drama, I don't have any STD's, and I'm not a drug dealer. I'm an mechanical and civil engineering student. I have a dark sense of humor, sarcastic, and I'm all about the little pleasures in life. I read a lot; books, newspapers, anything I can get my hands on really. My idea of a great date is a picnic at the beach or in Golden Gate Park, coffee at Java Beach, or getting dinner at a cool place in Noe Valley. While all of these are great traits I also look for in a mate, they seem to land me with fair regularity in the worst place known to all mankind: the friend-zone (insert dramatic sound effects here).

So I make a modest proposal: I will treat your like shit. I know, it sounds a little crazy (or not), but hear me out. You get all the thrill of having a boyfriend with a lifted truck, wearing flat brimmed caps advertising non-local athletic teams I don't even follow, and your carte lanche color choice of my wife-beaters. You get all the entertainment of me hitting on your friends in front of you, loudly explaining your faults and how you should fix them, and constant critique of all your hobbies and likes, which will mostly come out as me saying, ""that shit is gay"". And the best part is that through all of this, you get to explain away all my faults to your friends with such classic lines as, ""He isn't always like that"", or,""When we're alone he's a different person. You just don't understand him like I do."" In return, I get all the sex I want, including all 3am booty calls where I can't get it up anyway because I'm too drunk. You can still make me a sandwich. 

So are you ready for a relationship as extreme as my abs and the energy drinks I pound? Do you adore frosted tips, popped collars, and the Twilight films/books? Them I'm your man.

I'm a 24-year-old inner-city math/science teacher with a big heart. I'm a 5'6"" brunette with nice curves. I'm a published scientist who graduated from college with a 3.96 GPA, and if all goes well I'll soon be in school administration. 

I love: The Walking Dead, Pokémon, indie hip-hop, tea, energy drinks, wedge salads, steak, Netflix, roller coasters, swimming, biking, hiking, and nature photography.

I drink socially (a few times a month with my fellow teachers). I smoke hookah and weed (but don't smoke cigarettes).

As a romantic partner, I enjoy taking care of those I love, making sure they are happy and satisfied. I enjoy my sexuality and I share it very happily, willingly, passionately, and often (albeit, not on the first few dates). I love spending time together, but I understand that everyone needs their own hobbies, friends, and space to feel fulfilled. I'm understanding and communicative.

More about what I'm looking for: I would like to find a man in the Detroit area with a kind and caring personality, a positive outlook on life, and a good sense of humor. I admire people who have something going for them in life--whether that is school, a job, or an internship. I value intelligence and strength of character.

At this point, I'm looking for a relationship. I'd love to chat a bit via messages, then hit the town together--take a walk, see a movie, grab a drink, or get dinner. I'm not looking for a friends with benefits/casual/NSA situation. I'm looking for something with substance!

thank you, and have a wonderful evening.

Edit: i suppose i forgot to NSFW tag this post. i'm doing so now. also, to everyone who commented, thanks immensely, keep it up, i want to know what everyone has to say. a little surprised i didn't get more flak for this post, not that i'm saying i wanted it, but i was expecting some. you guys seem pretty entertained, so feel free to show your friends if you think they'll get a laugh.

Edit 2: noticed my post had some downvotes. i think that's great! i'm happy people are expressing their opinions even if they aren't in favor of my post. i'm doubting anyone who downvoted will be reading this, but i'm very curious to know your opinion on my post in greater detail, as i said before, i'm not simply interested in support, but why you disagree with my post. feel free to comment or PM me, you have my upvotes!",,True,,t5_2rn0e,1358297961.0,,,True,t3_16mi2b,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/16mi2b/20_m4f_everywhere_im_still_going_to_be_honest/,
1353049054.0,37,self.r4r,13ae77,18 [F4R] - I have a strange request. (A non-sexual one.),thismayseemstrange,58,21,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/13ae77/18_f4r_i_have_a_strange_request_a_nonsexual_one/,"Perverts, show yourselves out.

I am looking for a positive parental figure/role model. I would prefer mature, responsible adults in their 30's or older. But if you're in your 20's and just as responsible I guess that could work too. (To certain males) Please don't use this as a way to pursue something with someone younger and act out your sick desires. Sorry if I sound arrogant or such, I just want to put this out there right now while I can. I don't like creepy guys.

I want someone in my life who I can talk to, about my day, about school, about problems. I want someone who will able to help me understand things that I'm clueless in life about. I want someone who will at least show some interest in what I do. I want someone I can just have great conversations with, laugh with, and just have fun with. I want someone I can cry to when life has gotten to be too much. I don't want to be coddled though, I'd prefer if you laid out the cold truth. I need to be taught right from wrong. I need someone who cares for me. Someone who can do a damn good job at being there unlike my parents. 

I was raised in a very negative environment. I have noticed that I am starting to exhibit some negative behaviors like, cutting people from my life without feeling any emotion, sabotaging any relationships I have, social withdrawal, unable to hold a job, little to no interest in school and low academic performance. 

I am currently on the waiting list to see a therapist, but it will be a few months before they call me. I can't wait that long, I need someone to be there for me right now.

I want to change my upside down life and make it better. I don't want to be like any of my family members, I actually want to make something of my life. I feel like if I had some positive role model in my life it would help me greatly. You know, someone to motivate me and encourage me.

But this won't be just about me. You don't have to talk to me 24/7, we'll talk here and there. If you had a shitty day and want to talk about it, go ahead, I'll listen. If you want to share a new band you got into, I would love to give them a listen and geek out about them with you. If you want to show me pictures of your cat/dog doing something silly, I would love to see them. I will even send you pictures of my cat, Puddin, who does nothing but sleep, each in different angles so it looks slightly fun to look at.

I guess that's it.

Before you message me:

* I'm putting in effort to get to know you, so I would like that you put in effort as well.

* Too much words with too much topics overwhelms me.

* Too little words with not much to talk about bores me.

* If you're an adult who can't spell words properly, please don't bother. (Sorry, bad spelling just bugs me.)

* Messages like, ""hey"", ""sup"". ""lets talk"", ""do u hav skype lol"", ""want to see my dick"" will be ignored (even if said jokingly). Judging from those types of messages I know you won't be able to hold a proper conversation.


I sound like a bitch, but I just want to make it clear I'm not messing around and don't want anyone wasting my time.

1345655731.0,38,self.r4r,yna6w,27 F4M Chicago - Depraved and deprived...,shamelessmess,50,12,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/yna6w/27_f4m_chicago_depraved_and_deprived/,"**FINAL UPDATE:** Found what I was looking for (I hope)! Until next time, /r/r4r... :)

**UPDATE:** Meeting someone for coffee this evening. Thanks all for your responses/support!

**UPDATE:** Something work-related came up so I will be a tad slower in getting back to you. Please disregard my ""10mins"" comment below as I will still try to get back to as many people as I can, even if it's to say it's not going to work for me. Thanks!

I'm horny as hell and kinky as fuck. I'm generally not this forward or crass about it, but I've got an itch and it needs to be scratched ASAP, so to speak. I'm looking for one guy - **JUST ONE**. If it goes well, I'd like an ongoing FWB arrangement. If it goes *very* well, I'm open to the idea of an LTR.


Since I'm being so frank, I'm not going to lie to you: girls in /r/r4r get a *lot* of PMs. It's hard to pinpoint the ones that you really click with. So for both your and my benefit, here's an outline of exactly what I'm looking for and how I will proceed from here:


**PM me if you:**

* Live within 4hrs of Chicago

* Are a heterosexual unattached male

* Have been tested recently and have the paperwork to prove it

* Are familiar or proficient with kink, particularly BDSM (bonus points for *experienced* Doms)

* Have something to say in your PM that will give me more insight into you and your personality

* Are not opposed to sending a **SFW** picture before we meet


**What I will do from here:**

From the PMs I get, I will respond to as many as I reasonably can that meet most or all of the above. The shorter your PM, the less the likelihood that it will receive a response (just being honest). I really am the sort of person who hates that I can't reply to them all, as I'm sure you're for the most part decent folk, but I've posted before and have learned to have to cut out even good guys to get anywhere. **If you don't receive a response from me within 10 minutes of sending a PM, you are not going to.** It's probably nothing personal... it just means that I was either overwhelmed or found what I was looking for. **When I find what I'm looking for, I will update my post to indicate so.** This is also being x-posted to /r/chicagor4r and /r/BDSMpersonals. And now, the part you're probably curious about...

**About me:**

*The Basics* I'm 27 years old, 5'6"", 142lbs as of this morning. Long brown hair that is often dyed either red or black (currently both red and black), brown eyes, 34D's, and I'm hairless from below the eyebrows.


*The Kink* I'm a sub who has been divorced for two years and am fresh out of a 10-month-long FWB arrangement with a Dom who decided to pursue a relationship. I'm limited to bedroom play for now. Good on you if you can convince me otherwise. Since this isn't /r/BDSMpersonals, I'm not getting too much into the kink aspect here. I'm not going to rule out anyone inexperienced right away, but know that if I'm into you, this is an aspect of my sexuality that you will *have* to be okay and go along with as I can't get off without it.

This is the first real post for my bot that summarizes posts in [/r/r4r](/r/r4r) by gender/preference. Each line is a single post, with the age of the poster listed first when known.

I would greatly appreciate feedback on this. I originally considered having the bot post once per week, but r4r gets too many posts per week to fit them all into a single post (the 10000 character limit!). Would posts once per day be welcome? Or once per week but only covering upvoted and/or commented posts? Should I put more effort into parsing the unusually formatted post titles?

You guys were kind enough to say a few encouraging words and upvote the post considerably for this subreddit.

Well.. 10 months later and I haven't had any luck in real life, on here, on herpes dating sites, etc.  It's getting to the point where I wonder if I'm ever going to be intimate with anyone again.  Statistics say something like a 20% of the population has genital herpes.. well I don't know where they're all hanging out at.

The thing that kills me is that I'm a good looking guy so I constantly have to turn girls away because I don't want to tell them I have herpes.  I've had the talk with 3 girls and all 3 cut it off at that moment.  I know you can't say this without sounding arrogant or self conceited but I think I'm a pretty damn good catch.  And yet, herpes herpes herpes.  Some will say that if a girl won't look past the herpes, then she truly doesn't like you or something similar but that's just not reality.  Sadly, from talking to a few girls on dating sites.. guys largely do not care about getting HSV from their partners while the inverse is not true, girls care a lot more than guys.

Again.. I know this is conceited but, I'm good looking, smart, humorous, nice, driven, have my ducks in a row, etc. etc. and girls hit on me a lot.. but NOPE.. herpes.

Kill me.

Edit: Thanks for the support again.  One thing I did forget and want to mention as someone mentioned that herpes is with your for life so they'd personally never date anyone with it (I'm not saying anything's wrong with that viewpoint btw) is that might be the straw that broke the camels back in terms of my wallowing in self pity party.  I have had herpes for almost two years and I have NEVER had an outbreak.  0.00% herpes sores or anything.  The only reason I found out I was positive for it was getting routinely checked for STIs.  I got tested again thinking it was a false positive.  So for me it's an entirely social problem.  If you stubbed your toe, or the last hangover you had or biting your lip.. all worse physical problems than what I've experienced with herpes yet people would treat me as though I'm doomed.

His humble abode is located in the State of Connecticut, in the nation known as the United States. He has thrown himself off a cliff, been hit by a motor vehicle, has set his hand on fire, and has a metal rod in his arm. He enjoys the culinary arts, fine literature, crafting his own fine literature, listening to vinyl records, relaxing by an open fire, conversing about any topic, and all things romantic. He is knowledgeable in Mathematics, Science, History, and Politics. He is an agnostic atheist, but was brought up in the Jewish culture. He is proficient in the Arts of proper Dancing, Drawing, and the French and Latin Languages. He plays the Viola and aspires to pursue the Art of Medicine as a career.

*What He Seeks in a Lady*: She is first and foremost a similarly-minded. She is bright, cheerful, happy, and pleasant to be around. She allows the Gentleman to do things for her, because it is both the chivalrous thing to do, and a way to express his love for her. She is interesting and adventurous. She needn't be the life of every party, but when they meet her, people should wonder why she isn't. Obviously a beautiful Lady is desired, but what is the beauty of the Body compared to the beauty of the Mind, Soul, or Spirit? She enjoys the act of copulation, in all of its different variations. She could be his Soulmate, his Significant Other, his Procreating Acquaintance, his normal Acquaintance, or even his Long-Distance Acquaintance.

The Gentleman would like to thank you for your time, and sincerely hopes that you will consider leaving a comment or sending a PM.

*Edit the First*: The Gentleman welcomes **any and all** Ladies, despite distances. The Lady **need not** be from the Fine State of Connecticut, or even the United States. He is perfectly **content with remaining Friends**, should the good Lady who replies to his post want that. 

*Edit the Second*: The Gentleman thanks everyone for causing his post to be prominently displayed at the **top of the front page**. You all have helped make what appears to be the **most popular post in recent R4R history**.

I have been meaning to submit this for some time, but truthfully wanted to be sure it was all real before I did.  Every R4R success story I've seen has been about successful NSA relationships or we had a couple good dates types of stories, so I thought it was time to throw my hat into the ring.

I went through all the steps, Craigslist, Eharmony, Match.com, OkCupid, and so on, but never was able to find a real connection with anyone.  I subscribed to R4R a little over a year ago.  I've never made a submission to R4R and really no submissions of worth to Reddit as a whole, but hope that this submission will at least spark some interest.

Six months ago I responded to an F4R from a woman on the other side of the country.  My initial contact wasn't anything particularly impressive.  I shared a couple interests, linked her to my Facebook so she could hunt down pictures, and told her from the start I lived terribly far away.  Despite this we quickly exchanged messages which developed into one of the most engaging conversations in my life.  This eventually progressed to phone calls and Skype chats, and before we knew it we had a daily schedule to speak every single day.  Not one that either of us discussed mind you, but just a desire to talk to each other couldn't be held off any longer than that.  We spoke of philosophy and literature, video games and movies, what we each wanted out of life, and what we'd rather avoid.  All of this sounds terribly vague I know, but it wasn't really the content that mattered, it was the manner in which we shared it.

I have a past and secrets and faults and flaws, all of which I have been completely open with her about from the start.  For some reason, none of it scared her away.  Try as I might to show her I may not be worthy of her attention, she was unflinching in her acceptance of me exactly as I am.  In all my years on this earth I have never known a woman so understanding and caring as her.  She supports me fully in everything I do, no matter how foolish it may seem.  She wants for nothing more than my happiness, and knows I will do anything to maintain hers.

Luckily I work from home and have packed up my work to come visit her.  I have been staying with her for a month now and have no shame in saying that I love her completely.  I am now a 27 year old man, and had already resigned myself to settling for the best woman I could find, but even with a thousand lifetimes I could never have dreamed of finding a woman as perfect in my eyes as her.  She has given me more love than I have ever known, and if the universe would be kind enough to grant me those thousand lives I would spend every day of them thanking the stars for delivering her to me.

I suppose that's it for now, but if there is anything you'd like me to clarify or need more details about anything in particular I will do my best to answer.

**TL:DR**  Be attractive.  Don't be Unattractive.

She knows that I had intentions of making this post at some point, but out of respect for her privacy I will leave her name out of this story.

I work in the software industry (of course), love video games and sci-fi (of course), and also love spending time outdoors and doing crafty hobbies such as knitting (less of course-y). I live on the Eastside.

My ideal date might be a trip to the bookstore to check out new comics or sci-fi novels, followed by sushi or pizza. I'm a very low-maintenance person, and am happy to spend a weekend going for a walk or hike, taking a trip to the dog park, hanging out with friends, and watching movies on Netflix (important aside: my favorite movie of all time is ""Hackers"". Major bonus points if you love it even half as much as I do). I am also obsessed with baking...if you spend time around me, you'd better like pies and cake. Real ones, with eggs and sugar and butter, though-- none of this hippie carb-free, gluten-free, sugar-free crap.

I'm 5'3"", 112, and tattooed. I have been told I'm cute on numerous occasions, and not just by drunk strangers or guys yelling out of car windows. I'm a vegetarian who doesn't care if others eat meat. I'm an open-minded person and would never limit my relationships based on appearance, financial situation, religion or lack thereof. My only major deal-breakers are smoking, drugs, or disliking dogs. 

In the interest of complete openness, I am only looking for a serious relationship that could potentially lead to marriage. I know it's a little weird to be so up-front about this, but lately I've met a lot of fantastic people who just aren't ready for a long-term relationship, so I felt like I needed to say this.

Hi, friends! 

We recently decided to implement /u/AutoModerator to help us sift through new posts and comments on /r/r4r! 

**What the heck is AutoModerator?**

Look no further. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoModerator/comments/q11pu/what_is_automoderator/) is some information on the bot. For a TL;DR version: AutoModerator is a bot that has parameters set by us, the mods, and can approve and delete posts as well as message users telling them that their post was removed. 

**What kind of posts will the bot delete?**

There are a few things that we have the bot set to automatically delete:

1. Posts that do not follow the correct format of **Age [R4R] Location - Title**. In order for your post to *not be deleted*, you *must* include Age [R4R]. Location and title are not necessary. 

2. Posts that do not use the correct letters for tags. The current letters we accept are **M, F, T, and R**. You *only* use those four letters. 

3. Posts that explicitly say that the user is under the age of 18. /r/r4r is an 18+ subreddit. 

4. Posts that use (R4R) and R4R instead of [R4R]. We never really cracked down on it before, but using the brackets makes the subreddit look a bit more organized! 

5. Posts or comments that include personal information like usernames, phone numbers, emails, etc. Of course, it might be a little difficult for the bot to find all of these things, so we would ask that you report a post or comment if you see personal information. 

**What does this mean for me?**

Glad you asked! Really, not too much! Just follow the [posting](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/) guidelines and the example listed when you are trying to submit your r4r and you should be golden! 

**Can you give me some examples of a good post and a bad post?**

Definitely. 

Here are examples of a *good post*:
&gt;24 [M4F] 

&gt;19 [F4R] Texas - I want BBQ

&gt;32/33 [FF4M] - Movie night! 

&gt;[meta] I'd like some feedback on my posts!


Here are examples of a *bad post*:
&gt;24 (M4A) 

&gt; F4Friends 19 I want BBQ - Texas 

&gt;32F/33F 4M - Movies!

&gt;Why does no one respond to my posts? META

**I have some more questions! Where do I ask them?**

**THE GIRL:**  I'm a Sophomore in College, majoring in CompSci and plan to minor in English.  I work full time at a center that troubleshoots for a rather popular video streaming service.  Outside of that, I'm generally just nerding around-- playing video games, reading, going out bowling, or whatever.  I'm always up for spur of the moment events and generally go with the flow-- which is funny since as relaxed as everyone says I am, I'm also generally a pretty sensitive person.

I am a very proud and outspoken geek.  Not in the douchebaggy way where I try to compete with people in pissing contests-- but in that I proudly wear my fandoms on my sleeves.  Literally.  I have a literary fandom tattooed to my shoulder and 90% of my torso wardrobe are shirts with some sort of Pop Culture/Game/Comic reference.  Not that that's uncommon.

I'm a sap.  Yup, I'm a lovey dovey sap.  I don't have many beliefs, not with religion or anything.  But, if there's one thing I believe in, it's love.  Aside from the fact I grasp it's partially a chemical reaction-- but anyway. On the plus side-- I really don't get the marketed types of 'love'.  I don't do romance books much and while I like a good love story, most of them just make me laugh when it comes to book or film.  The bottom line is, I'm a very loyal and monogamous person.  If we're together, that's all that matters to me.  My eyes and heart are for that guy alone, but that's granted he likewise works with me to make sure we don't alienate the friends and other people in our lives that count.

**THE HOBBIES:**  I'm a gamer.  I do computer gaming and I also have a love for my console gaming.  I don't play the stupid games where I flame others for preferring one over the other, I'll defend what I think but if they can't accept it-- I generally just shrug off the conversation and move onto more pleasant things.  I love all other types of games-- I miss playing D&amp;D.  One of my goals in life is to finally find people to play WOD (Werewolf) with.  Roleplaying is just... amazing to me, I also love to take part in it's literary for as well.  I also am a big, big Magic the Gathering player.

I love to read, even though it feels like I've lost alot of my free time for it lately.  Christopher Moore, Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett, George R. R. Martin, JKR, Eoin Colfer, and... yeah, I'm not going to get into this list it takes too long.  Just, I love all sorts of books.  I like to take suggestions and discuss the worlds.  I once got to take a Humanities Course that analyzed Lord of the Rings in it's entirety-- if there were more classes like that, my school life would be even more amazing.

I enjoy plenty of things beyond the general nerd stuff.  I like building models, repairing computers, going bowling, lazer tag, midnight movies, roaming, people watching, turning movies into an episode of MST3k, and... I dunno.  It's hard to know what all I want to do, I'm just willing to live life and do whatever there is to have fun and have some memories.

**THE HOPE:**  I'm not going to lie (I'm a pretty blunt person, I don't like head games).  I pretty much did this since today marked FOUR years of singledom for me.  Mostly that's my fault since I take matters of the heart pretty seriously, thrice scorned and all that good stuff.  I always want to make new friends, so if you don't think I'm your cup of tea, that's cool-- but if you are up for still being chat buds or even gaming pals, I'm more than happy to have you.

When it comes to dating, I just don't want games.  I'm an affectionate, loyal, and caring person.  Sure, I have my problems too-- I'm oversensitive, can be a bit jealous, and hell... I'm just a person.  I'm not perfect.  But, I know that the sort of affection and love I can potentially give a person who gives me the time and attention needed to build the lasting relationship I want will never be disappointed with me.  There are few things I find unforgivable in life, but the idea of cheating is one of them-- so the whole unfaithfulness thing is obviously something that disgusts me.  I don't judge if you're a polyamorous sort of person, or it's just your nature to spread the love.  I get it, it's just not me.  So, that's why I'm just putting it out there that I'm pretty much always just waiting around to see who's willing to take a shot at building something lasting.  We don't have to be forever, as awesome as that would be, but I also don't want just be the flavor of the week.

**END RAMBLE:** Sorry for all the word vomit.  I just like to speak what's floating around in my head. lol.  

Hopefully, I'll make a couple friends out of you all. :3 Feel free to shoot me a message or comment. If you are up for some gaming friendships just let me know!

I'm in the NL for the summer, but will return in September to the NY/NJ area. I have a steady FWB thing here, but it's pretty vanilla. I'm craving more...

I want to, uh, act out a fantasy, if you'll indulge me... I want to be picked up from the airport. On the ride home [to mine or yours (I have an apartment in NYC), doesn't matter], I want you to pull over to the side of the road and stop the car. Order me to get out, push me up against the car and fuck me. Yeah... I can't get this little scenario out of my mind. Arghh. Also, I would be ideally wearing a skirt for easy access. Afterwards we can even fuck again in the safety of home and/or just part ways. Since we have a full month before this will even have a chance of happening, I would like to Skype on the regular to see if we even have any connection, sexual or otherwise. Video-chatting with you is an absolute must, so don't bother responding if you aren't willing to at least wave me hello.

If we hit it off, it would be pretty hot if we could act out *your* fantasies, too.

I like guys with beards and/or moustaches. Kissing a scruffy face makes me kinda weak in the knees. I'm 5'2, petite (~110) and would LOVE if you were much taller and not so petite.

Since the feedback regarding the renewal of the IRC channel was so positive, me and the other mods decided to take action and bring it back.

- So, there are obviously rules that are on the IRC's topic, that I'll want everyone to read before jumping into the channel - this directed to people reading this ""launch thread"" - http://pastebin.com/3KCrehc9.

- The current operators are me and snugglehistory (on IRC as snuggle), but of course we will be needing more and will naturally be nominating people we find are well-integrated in the channel and regular enough. And trustworthy. It's a priority seeing as we're so few to so many people who will join the channel, but we're also trusting on people's common sense to not go crazy and start breaking rules like criminals.

- For those who use an IRC client, we're situated in:

            Server: irc.freenode.net

            Channel: #r4r

- That said, you have several ways to access our IRC if you're not IRC-savvy. You can look into getting a client, such as [IceChat](https://www.google.pt/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDAQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.icechat.net%2F&amp;ei=3Uf9UO3-N5OYhQf36IDgBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNERbPP8_Z9B6SbOvhOhXeNIBdowXA&amp;sig2=EPL9phpX4fJVRw5uNj33JQ&amp;bvm=bv.41248874,d.ZG4), [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/) or [XChat](http://xchat.org/), for Windows, and [limechat](http://limechat.net/mac/) or [babbel](http://www.babbelirc.com/index.lasso?go=download) for OSX. 

- Or you can use one of the more accessible web-clients, such as [the official freenode (our server!) web-client](http://webchat.freenode.net/).

All this said, I can't stress this enough - read the rules and abide by them!

All is said, everyone enjoy this new way of communicating to people. If anyone needs help with connecting, feel free to ask in this thread and I'll hastily answer the best I can. Feel free to PM either me or snugglehistory, too, as we're in charge of the channel. :D

P.S.: Use this link to go directly to the channel: http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=r4r

I'm out of the coutry at the moment, so this is going to be an online thing for a while.
I'm open to supportive friends as well. So, if you're a loving person, I'll appreciate the kindness and reciprocate it :D",,False,,t5_2rn0e,False,,,True,t3_11mq0c,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/11mq0c/23_f4m_wideeyed_for_some_tlc/,

Ahoy,  I'm madeyeminnie, (not my real name, I may tell you the dumb story later), newly 20 years of age and I'm here to make some cool internet buddies from far away lands.  Ladies are definitely welcome too :) but the taco:bratwurst ratio here is a little uninspiring so I don't want to get my hopes up. Nevertheless,  if you are single, good at chatting crap for hours and not on any wanted lists then you're the Redditor I have in mind! 



My hobbies include reading, cycling, musicals, video games, film marathons, assorted woman stuff, watching cartoons and sleeping. My dislikes include, but are not limited to, ugly animals and browser redirects. If I were a colour, I guess I'd be purple and, if I were an animal, I'd be a mboscodictiasaur. How about you? *I hope I get all the colours of the rainbow in my inbox.*


As a fledgling 'Muricaphile, I'd love to know about you, your state and whatever else you want to proffer up.  Your pic gets mine!

Looking for a week-long, NSA boyfriend, who can show me around the city he lives in.",travelightly,39,4,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/ewwnn/26f_wants_to_travel_somewhere_for_a_week_looking/,"This is perhaps a strange r4r, but, it has always been my favorite way to travel (meeting somebody and exploring a city with a stranger-- although, it has always happened by chance, not a pre-arranged thing like this).

A bit about me: I'm a thin, tall blonde (I think I'm pretty) with big-time love of traveling, music, architecture/art, food, dancing, drinking, and just world/life exploration.  I have quite a few geeky tendencies, but, that's something we can talk about as we get to know each other.  I will make a good week-long ""girlfriend.""  No drama, just fun!

Now, what I'm looking for:

A male, 23-30 years of age. I want somebody (at least fairly) confident and fun to be around! Somebody who enjoys the small details in life. I like academic/artistic types usually... as long as you don't take yourself too seriously and can laugh/have fun.  I'm physically attracted to thin/fit guys. There aren't really a lot of other physical stipulations... I find unique looking guys attractive.  Oh and I'm not interested in the guys who are always posting on /gonewild and are really only interested in the whole possibility of sex thing. 

I want a guy that knows and loves his city. I'm particularly interested in Washington DC, Boston, NYC, or another big city on the East Coast. But, Seattle or Portland may be a good choice... But you have to really KNOW your city! I want to see the underground stuff. I want to go see a house show at some friend's house. I want to go to some hole-in-the-wall bar that not many people know about.  I want to eat at an awesome teeny-tiny Vietnamese restaurant that isn't all ""the rage.""  All of these are just examples, of course.

So, if you're pretty awesome and you want an awesome ""girlfriend"" for a week, let's start planning this thing.  Skype or MSN sessions will be a must... and again, this won't be until Spring, but, I need to start the decision-making and planning process now (since I work full-time and have to give notice).

PM me first!! feel free to send a picture. I'll send you guys one back.  Thanks for your time, and, I hope my fantasy can become reality =)


**Edit:** Thanks for all the nice messages, everybody-- I'll be taking at least another day or two to respond to messages and all that jazz. Also, I'm not willing to leave North America (and I prefer the US) for this trip. I love traveling overseas, but, this trip is all about getting to see some parts of the US or possibly Canada (and some fellow US/Canadian Redditor) that will be new to me! 

Oh, and, it's been mentioned somewhere about being a free loader or trying to get a guy to pay for my trip by just using my sexy sex appeal... I just want to be clear that I will be paying my way.  When I date, I go dutch, so, I will of course be paying all of my expenses, since I'm kind of ""dating"" you for the week. Yeahh, that's right, paranoid guys out there-- I'm really in it for the fun and the experience!

For once in my life, I just want a girlfriend.",hilittlebuddy,54,13,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1jn60d/27_m4f_philadelphia_ive_never_been_in_a_real/,"Alright. I'm going to try my best to be brutally honest and hopefully not sound like a sob story.

First of all, I'm happy. Life is good. I do what I love for a living and it can only get better from here.

I'm also shy. Exceptionally shy. I've had great friends and great times, but at the end of the day, every day, I'm lonely. When it's is all you've known for most of your life, you learn how to deal with it, but it still sucks. Now I'm making an effort to see if I can change my life for the better.

I'm not so shy that I can't to talk to people. I'm shy in the sense that it's extremely hard for me to make the first move on women. I know how to make conversation and small talk, but it's almost like I'm physically unable to take things to the next level on my own (and to be honest, it pisses me off that men are generally expected to do this). Regardless, it's crippling and I know it's a problem. In the very few times I've been romantic with someone, they were the first to make the move. By the way, I can't even tell you how happy it makes me when this happens.

When people find out about my situation, many of them don't understand. I get why they don't. I know I'm an anomaly. I accept it, and I'm looking for someone else who will accept me too.

I don't care about casual sex and never really wanted it. The same goes for one night stands. Personally, I look at that stuff like this: if you like someone enough to engage in the most personal act that humans can do together, why would you never want to see them again? I do know some people enjoy that and that's absolutely fine. To each their own.

I'm not looking for advice on how to get laid. Despite being a virgin, it's not my priority. I've always wanted my first time to be with someone great. They should feel the same way about me and preferably I've known them for more than two hours.

Here's a brief description of my appearance, to give you an idea: 6'5"", fit/thin body, caucasian, long hair (dark blonde), glasses. I'm told I'm handsome from time to time by ladies other than my mom and sister (but they tell me I am too).

**A bit about me:**
I *looooove* music, you just can't take music away from me. I don't play any instruments myself if you were wondering, wish I could play guitar though! I like to travel and get to know different cultures. I love languages aswell, so if someone out there can speak another language than English please message me (I *beg* you)! I *sometimes* play videogames but not fully into it. Don't expect me to know all the new games cause I literally have *no clue*. The only game I play right now is League of Legends (on the Europe West server), I don't play it that much. It took me a while to like it but a few guys got me into it (yay?).


I'm a bit shy at first but once I get to know you I will open up alot. I'm incredibly silly but matured, I like to joke around. I'm an atheist but I *will* respect your beliefs if you have one. I'm 5'4"" and fairly slim if anyone was wondering? I don't want you to be too clingy or to seem desperate, I want to get to know you.

I'm based in Europe and I hope that doesn't keep you from messaging me. (I *dearly hope* not.)
I would like to communicate through reddit messages and then later maybe to skype (we'll see).

Maybe that makes me weird. 


 I don't game or even understand any of the concepts of gaming. I love books, and cupcakes. I love playing music. I play the viola. 


I am a morning person, and am usually generally happy. I don't particularly like cats.  I don't internet much, but when I do I love connecting with people, and researching interesting places to adventure and visit! 


I want to ask you questions and trade stories about life and travel. I want to get coffee and smile a lot. I like people with nice teeth, mostly because I find people with terrible teeth very sad to look at. I love going to the movies in the middle of the day when I can take the vacation time off work.

It would range from going to clubs, different eating places, posing for some professional photo shootings and maybe shooting me, watch some big movies together, and even hang out at some friends' places.

You don't have to have a house or a relationship to be my frand though.

I just read The Regulators by Stephen King and the ending made me cry like a bitch.

What is the last book you read? What is your Life Philosophy? Do you have a cat? Send me a picture of your cat(s). Or dog. Or chincillas, sugar gliders, horses, pigs, whatever, I love animals. Okay. I want to see your animals. PM me that shit.

Basically I'd like to hook up with a nice guy (but not too nice!).

When I've done this in the past, I've gotten into the bad habit of talking to the first people to message me and then I can't handle any more conversations.  Really awesome people tend to slip through the cracks when this happens, so by letting a bunch (hopefully!!) of messages come in before I choose who to talk to, that should be relieved.  I also plan on sending ""sorry, no thanks"" messages to people so that you aren't left hanging. I know I hate messaging people and not getting a response back.

I'm up for kik, PM, e-mail, and possibly Skype if I take a liking to you.

So who am I?

I'm an engineering student, born in the North but I've been living in the SE USA for the past few years.  I'm moving in a few weeks in a tiny town in Arkansas, and I would love to make some great internet friends to keep me company while I'm away from my friends and family.  

I like all sorts of typical things.  Right now I'm watching The Newsroom and The Office, but in the past year I've watched Avatar: TLA, The West Wing, Arrested Development, Parks &amp; Rec, Community, and some Psych.

I love all sorts of music, but in the past six months I've been loving The Smiths, Mumford &amp; Sons, Avett Brothers, Iron &amp; Wine, Sigur Ros, Bon Iver, and Ben Howard.  But I've been known to listen to everything from Marilyn Manson to Hoodie Allen.

I love to learn about politics, economics, religion... really any school of thought that differs from my own.  I used to be incredibly argumentative, but I've toned that down quite a bit so that I can actually have conversations with people.

In my free time I love to knit, hike, kayak, or just curl up with an animal and watch Netflix.  I'm a dog and cat foster mom, so I deal with a lot of poop and get a lot of love in return.

My name is Sarah, and I hope you talk to me!!

We don't agree with the model of a family that is a male and female parent raising their children by themselves. But that's where we are nonetheless. 

This could be a romantic and sexual relationship, so if that is what you need then we can talk, or it could be a family style relationship. We do want more sex partners as we are polyamorous, but we want more people to love and live with much much more than we want more people to fuck. I only bring it up because we want that too and we wouldn't want to scare away the people who are looking for a romantic and sexual relationship even though that is our secondary concern. Ideally we would love to have another sex partner or another female to have babies with. But we don't need orgasms and procreation anywhere near as much as we need people to love and to love us.

We have room for another adult without any economic contribution. We don't have rules in our house other than don't be a dick. We're most interested in finding someone who would want to live and learn with us. We have no preconceived notion of how a human life should be lived.

We live in an awesome town and free room and board as long as you are willing to jive with us is a pretty sweet deal in this town. I am constantly doing awesome projects and inventing things so maybe you could be taken into the fold as a little brother or little sister type person and I could teach you some awesome stuff. If you have nothing to learn from us then you could take on the role of wise aunty or uncle who just loves to share their knowledge. 

This is literally an R4A, we just want someone to come join our family. And we have every position available, from child to grandparent. If you are looking for something in life and you can't find it, hit me up. I won't try to sell you on something you don't actually need or want.

When we started Skyping we clicked easily. We talked for hours on end, laughed about dumb things, learned we had many similar interests. He was easy to talk to and I felt so comfortable with him to the point of telling him embarrassing stories about me, which he likes to lovingly poke fun at me about from time to time. We would draw silly pictures for each other and just have an overall good time with one another.

He was dorky (HAH! NERD!), sweet, adorable, and fun to be around. I couldn't control myself and I started falling for him. After some time I confessed my feelings after making a complete fool of myself and crying my eyes out in a Skype call.

But here we are today, coming up on 3 months of dating. We both live in Canada, but are in different provinces. By the end of July I'll finally be able to meet him. I'm so excited!

I'm single, so no boyfriend to lavish gifts upon, and it's sort of gotten to that point with my friends where we all know we're not going to get each other anything, because that would force the person into getting us something back, and yeah it just doesn't happen. 

I don't like this, it saddens me that I have no gift hunting to do.  Personally I'm Jewish and it's night three of Hanukkah, and I'm in the gifting spirit! I LOVE getting people presents (and yes ok receiving presents too).  I always hunt high and low to find the perfect gifts, because all I want is to make the receiver that special breed of happy-excited when they rip open the gifts.  There is nothing so satisfying, rewarding, and joyful as gift giving done well in my opinion. 

Here is what I propose:

You and me get to know each other a little bit, we skype to ensure we're not going to gift each other antrax, we chat to get a better sense of each other, we both make up ""wish lists"" with things we like/want and anything to avoid.  Then the gift giving begins! We both will go shopping find gifts for each other and send them off!  I'll do my absolute best to make your Hanukkah, Kwanza, Christmas, Winter Solstice, or just Winter and I like presents, a little brighter! The point of this isn't that you're filthy rich (cause I'm not I'm sorry I will probably go above and beyond on your gifts cause it's what I do, but I can't afford to buy you a Bugatti Veyron it's just not in the cards).  The point of this is to brighten both our holiday seasons, by the joy of giving and receiving awesome, thoughtful, personally tailored gifts.

I can only do this with a handful of people or I'll just stress myself out (cause I really do work hard to pick awesome gifts) so if this interests you send me a PM telling me why I should choose you/what made you want to reply to this and hopefully I'll be sending gifts your way soon! :)


EDIT: I feel I should also mention since this is reddit afterall that on top of being a girl on the internet, I'm not a huge nerd, I'm much more of a girly-girl with a brain so if the idea of shopping for presents that don't include Dr.Who references terrifies you, you've been warned! :P",,False,,t5_2rn0e,1355200081.0,,,True,t3_14n8uq,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/14n8uq/23_f4r_usa_presents_who_doesnt_love_presents/,

Thirdly, I would prefer someone who is open to letting me crush on them at this point of my life. I am extremely straight forward and am tired of games, 'cause I never participate in those.

I don't care where you're located, I don't want to limit myself here. We have planes, automobiles and skype that will deter you from thinking distance is a no go. I am in Orange County and I go to school in Pomona. 

What I want: adventures, similar taste in film (Wes Anderson, Tarantino, Cohen Brothers, Army of Darkness, Joss Whedon, Labyrinth, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, blah blah, Star Wars and Harry Potter), similar taste in music (Mumford and Sons, Radical Face, Catch 22, Big Band, Punk, Folk punk, Indie, Taking Back Sunday, Childish Gambino...), witty/dry/sassy humor ( I need someone on the same wavelength as me, this is extremely important), preferably an alternative look to them or fucking awesome style (but not limited to this), someone who will take me out for once, open to bungee jump, open to rock climb, open to Disneyland dates! open to roller coasters, open to learn how to swing dance with me, open to grabbing drinks and being silly together, confident enough to not feel dumb in front of people singing karaoke, laid back is a must, outgoing, accepts me for who I am.

I love comedy, music, art, star-gazing, and being outside. I'm a drinker, smoker, smoker, cat owner and joke teller. I want you to make me laugh, get the fuzzies and all that other stupid shit that I miss so dearly.

 Send a PM, tell me of yourself and we can go from there. If you send a photo and I like you, I'll send one back.

I need some f-ing girlfriends in the city! I work with all married/old people, and grad school is a few years off so I have no real way of meeting people.  I am very happy at my profession, but I need some girlfriends to go out with/to blow off steam and for support (I'd be lying if I said I wasn't actually going through something right now). But seriously anyone else feel this way? 

Do you want to go out this weekend? Let's go to a club and dance the night away, or just find some amazing bar with should-be-illegal-they-are-so-good cocktails, or wine, or craft beer (I'm flexible) and just drink and chat, or maybe flirt with the right guys/girls should they manifest themselves. 

I'm smart, cute (can dress up/to suit the occasion), socially functioning and just want someone to grab a drink with, or watch a movie with as we paint our nails, or eat delicious food, or gallons of chocolate and ice cream while our periods synch up and we talk about how easy guys have it. 

PLEASE PLEASE MESSAGE ME! I'm fun and easy to get along with I promise. I'm neither a party animal nor a shut-in, I can find some common ground with just about anybody. Let's get out and have some fun. Bonus points if you live/are willing to come ANYWHERE above midtown.

You may remember me from a few months ago as the person who created Your Personal Cupid. Firstly, I want to apologize. A lot of you hoped beyond odds to find a match, but alas I have failed you in that respect. The absolutely crushing amount of responses was simply too overwhelming combined with personal issues. So I ran. I ran so far away. I honestly didn't not know how to handle it all. However, I came back, as if by some otherworldly compulsion. And I found people still searching, hoping beyond hope that there is someone out there to here them. And I found that others have tried to fill in the shoes I left. And I've decided: this will happen.

The community has expressed both its need for companions and it's willingness to help others establish a connection. Before my departure, I established /r/cupids but left it an orphaned subreddit. I do not feel that my previous actions have warranted me to return as head of the resurrection of this project, but I do not want to see it die. So this I ask of you reddit. This project needs a new leader, one who will foster the idea and let it flourish and grow. /r/cupids is in need of mods, and I know some of you out there are more than willing. I really want to see sone happy couples out there, so let's find a way to make this work! 

Again, I'm sorry about the prior disappointment, but I can't let a good idea die, and you all certainly deserve to have a say in the way this unfolds.

I know that many of you hear from many of the men around here, the most absurd and detestable things, things that make you cringe inside and regret that men find you irresistible, which - believe me - you are. 

I won't waste your time with such nonsense. Instead, I'm going to tell you straight-up about myself, as clear as a I can. There's a lot that goes into me, and I think you'll find me quite charming. 

I've had a hard time in my life, though I like to think I've turned out okay. As a boy, I never knew my mother, since she died shortly after I was born. I lived happily with my father, who educated and trained me as best he could, in our upper middle-class suburb. No one lived within miles of us, and people rarely visited, save my father's clients. My dad did speciality work, fine arts and artisan items that rich people commissioned from him. He actually maintained a full armory, since he was among the best weaponsmiths on the coast, and you can imagine what fun it was for me when he'd let me try out the things he kept! I no this will sound tragic, coming after that, but he was murdered when I was about 10 years old. 

Fortunately, the family assets supported me, and I think - in some ways - things turned out for the best. I received an education after his death, and I've devoted my life to finding justice for my father and people like him. I've also made many friends. I met this big guy, my closest friend. He's twice the size of anyone I've ever seen, and four times nicer. Sure, at times he can be as thick as bricks, but we get along well and I wouldn't trade his friendship for the world. I also knew a crazy Italian man, he was a business partner and mentor, but I have since lost track of him. 

After my most recent business stint, I met my second-best-friend, Robert. He's a bit of a cad, somewhat flighty, but he's the only person I know who's better educated and quicker witted than I am! I'm helping him out these days, but it's a secondary sort of thing to me.

That way you know the ones to avoid.",,44,11,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1iq4bx/meta_we_do_want_ladies_to_post_helpful_meta_posts/,"[So there was this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1ipulv/meta_four_real_reasons_why_a_lady_does_not_reply/) (now deleted) offering insight on why your post won't get a reply. A couple of months ago [we had a similar one too](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1be0pp/meta_guys_of_r4r_have_you_ever_wondered_why_you/). I even [wrote about it](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1bfgz6/meta_now_you_all_know_why_r4r_doesnt_work_it_cant/):

&gt;There's no way to maximize your response rate's quality while simultaneously optimizing quantity. ... You'll either get a lot of crappy messages (if you're a girl) or a few [often mediocre] responses (if you're a guy). The system cannot produce anything else.

1. This subreddit's method of ""matching"" people (which is basically shooting wildly into the dark at random hoping to hit a moving target) cannot optimize both quality and quantity. 

2. Put another way, women get too many (bad) messages and men get too few good ones. It's a negative feedback loop - mostly because it doesn't systematically reward quality and it doesn't allow people to easily control the quantity/quality of responses.

2. The subreddit's demographics are probably against you too - the posts and responses are largely from (1) American (2) Caucasian (3) straight (4) men (5) who tend to like video games. You won't get much diversity of response here. Unless this is your type I guess.

3. Same goes for the girlposts too - *tons* of white gamer girls here and not much else. It's fine if you're really into gaming, but not so much fun when you aren't. 

There's *nothing wrong with having standards* and making them clear to your audience. But before you get frustrated with R4R, consider the audience that tends to haunt these pages:

* Is the person you're looking for likely to be on this forum looking for companionship now or in the near future?

* Or would they be out doing something else that you could easily join in? If so, why are you on R4R and not out there?

Last of all, just have fun and [don't take this shit too seriously](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1ipulv/meta_four_real_reasons_why_a_lady_does_not_reply/). 

The **real** reason you aren't getting lots of quality responses isn't because you're a terrible human being, or your post sucks, or your reply sucks. It's because R4R is basically blind, random, and pure dumb luck. You don't really control whether or not someone will reply to your post or message at all.

Sending dick pics definitely doesn't help, but neither do ""helpful"" opinion meta posts that purport to tell you Why Nobody Loves You On R4R.^^1 At least the ones which are just OP projecting their own standards on everyone else.

**TL;DR**: Can you taste the irony here guys? CAN YOU?!

Firstly, there have definitely been improvements on people following the post title rules, keeping the subreddit easy to search and browse, save for around 5 to 10 posts a day. Thank you, everyone, for following the stuff we specified the last time we PSA'd.

Secondly, seeing as [the guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/) are now over a week old, we'll start applying them severely, as in, **deleting posts that don't follow the guidelines and warning the people through PM**, as opposed to a friendly reminder like we've been doing since for last week.

So, yeah, this is both a reinforcement of the new rules for those that didn't see the last ones and a warning on our change of policy - please make it easy for everyone and follow the guidelines!

It's been about a year since my last relationship and I feel I'm finally ready to connect with another. I am sadly, not looking for something online. I have done that many times before and while it can be done. I want someone close by.

I live in rural Illinois, about two hours west of Chicago. I wouldn't mind meeting someone from there since it isn't far.
A little bit about me- I'm turning 23 this Saturday! I work full time during the week, but have every weekend off.
I normally don't say this right away in the post, but I am in a wheelchair. I was born with a bunch of birth defects that has left me paralyzed from the waist down, but I have full range and movement of my arms and torso. Before you wonder, I am completely self independent. I always encourage questions about my disability. Better to ask then not know, even the hard questions. So, please ask me anything.

I love sci-fi, and am a huge Doctor Who fan. I'm also a big star wars nerd. I love chatting about movies and television. I went to school to be an animator, but that is not currently what I do at my job. I play league of legends a lot online, and would love another friend on there. I also spend a fair amount of time on steam games. We could play lots of video games together.

I want someone I can connect with, see often and hopefully start a something towards a relationship.
I have lots of pictures available if you just ask. I can also tell you the specific town I live in private messages.

Every single relationship I've had has been... weird and extremely frustrated and none of them ended well. I'm almost 23, graduating soon and I'm tired of pointless shit and wasting time and I'm looking for something, well, someone really serious. 

I study and practice archaeology, it's my one passion. When I excavate everything I dig up comes alive to me, I immerse myself in the wonder that thousands of years ago people actually lived and did all those things that were normal to them in the exact spot I'm excavating, finding things that were intimate to them, it's just, wow.
Fitness is very important in my life, I have a rigid workout schedule and basically my routine decides what I eat, when I eat, how I sleep, how I plan my day etc. Working out itself is a very spiritual (not religious, just like, brings you closer to your humanity) experience for me.
I like to keep myself busy with random stuff, I collect things about subjects that fascinate me, for instance I am CRAZY about 70s culture, and my kitchen is filled with like 40-year old appliances, and I've got an old record player on which I play original LPs, the sound is just amazing. I can spend hours in a record store that has like a back room with second-hand records
Other things I fill my time with include mostly watching sitcoms, playing the odd computer game and poking my cat while he is trying to sleep. I AM a social person, sort of, I just don't get out much because I like to do the things that I do, I'm not really shy. What I would like though is someone who can help me discover new things, things they're into, things they like, and discover things with. 
I have very strong, unwavering beliefs and principles. Free speech is holy to me, so much that I believe the concept of being insulted is just stupid. I believe strongly in the harshness and reality of life, life is unfair and it's up to you to make the best out of it, do whatever the hell you want really. Honesty and trust are also very important to me, in a relationship especially.

What I am looking for is a girl/woman between the ages of 18-26. Someone who knows EXACTLY what they want and stick with it. Someone who is into a mature relationship, no games, no insecurities, you're just two people who have a special bond together and decide to share a great number of wonderful things, which includes your thoughts and feelings. Someone who doesn't get tired of affection and appreciation. Yes, I am clingy, when I believe someone is special and interesting I don't feel there's a reason to not express that and remind that person of just how special she is to me.
I'd love to have someone who can sometimes just sit inside all day with me and do nothing at all. Poke my cat together for a while, watch some sitcoms, read something interesting with me, play some music, whatever. I'd love to go out and do couple-ey stuff, but what makes a relationship for me special is that you are just.. together and enjoy things together because it's just... a joint experience. You're not two strangers who are trying to get at something, you're two people in a relationship, you share, you know what you enjoy together, so enjoy it!
That brings me to the next topic which is sex. I LOVE sex, I devote myself fully to well, anything I do in bed really. I'm not totally awkward about sex, but I do have a high libido and girls have had the impression in the past that I just wanted them for sex, while for me it's like... a package deal. Sex is an amazing and intimate experience you share and you can do INCREDIBLE things to and for eachother, it's a wonderful part of a relationship, and a relationship with lack of sex is just... empty to me. Like I said before, you share yourselves together, and shutting any part of yourself off for the other is just like you're two strangers. I'm incredibly devoted to any relationship, and sex is a major part of that.

There's so much more I'd like to tell about who I am or what I am looking for, but this is already getting too long.

To the issue at hand, if there is a local region you want to add, create the subreddit, and message us the links.

**Other things that I love;**


- Reading. Words cannot describe how much I love books. On my main account, r/books is easily the place I've submitted the most content. The Namesake (Jhumpa Lahiri),  Maps For Lost Lovers (Nadeem Aslam) and  Four Loves (C.S. Lewis) are my all-time favorites. Some old childhood favorites include Lemony Snickett and the lovely Enid Blyton. 
- TV! Flight of the Conchords, Misfits,  Futurama, Dexter, Mighty Boosh, The Simpsons, Inbetweeners, My Name's Earl to name a few. Ricki Lake is def a guilty pleasure. 
- Swearing... especially people who curse freely and with abandon. I'm a nice girl so I live vicariously through those who can slip cocksucker into everyday use. 


**I hate;**


- Marilyn Monroe quotes on Facebook. *If you can't handle me at my wo-*....
- Marilyn Monroe quotes anywhere. 
- Actually, just Marilyn Monroe.
- Who the hell does she think she is? 
- Audrey was *so* much classier and I ain't just saying that because I have small tits. 



**I'm okay with**;

Most things including recreational drug use. That means you, r/trees!


**I am;**

- 20 years of age. 
- 5'6"".
- Brunette.
- Dark brown eyes. 
- Feminine. (feminine != bimbo)
- Atheist. 


EDIT: Feel free to ask for a picture in private - I don't mind. This is the internet so, for all intents and purposes, it is prudent to assume that I am after your kidneys until proven otherwise. It would be really nice if you could share one of yours with me though :)


**Looking for;**


Someone with a sense of humor! Self-deprecating, goofy, dry, sarcastic, crude, cocky... it doesn't matter. I love a guy who can make me laugh. I have many a Skype Date in mind so awkward silences are out of the question. Know any bad jokes? SHARE THEM. 

A sense of adventure or shared interests never go amiss either. 



**Not looking for;**


Close-ups of your phallus. It's probably awesome and sparkly but come on, time and a place. 


That's it... I guess. Me in a nutshell. Some things are missing but that's because I'm trying to be mysterious here (obviously...) You'll just have to PM me for the rest. ;) I'll be near my laptop for a while so I will try to get back to everyone as quickly as possible. Goodbye for now. :)

I am a 21 year old woman living in Utah. Maybe you’re from Utah which is great or maybe you’re not which is also good cause I like talking to people. I’m going to try and avoid all the clichés and say “I’m a fun loving girl, I like to go out and have fun, I hate drama, and I would love to travel” because that basically describes anyone with a heartbeat. So instead I’m just going to throw some things out there. 

I really wish bioluminescent trees were a thing. Imagine a world where streetlamps are replaced by glowing trees. And if I could have any super power in the world, it would be [the beard slap.]( http://i.imgur.com/6qLjt.gif) I don’t see how it could be beneficial for fighting crime, but it would be a hoot at parties. It would also be a blessing and a curse. If someone has a beard I will violate their personal space to get knuckle deep in that man fur. I couldn’t be trusted with the beard slap power. 


I have a horrible addiction. It’s almost crippling. Seriously, Cheetos are like my life blood. The good news is I haven’t resorted to snorting the remnants of Cheetos bits to get my fix. 

I’ve watched the Lord of the Rings trilogy more times than anyone should, and I really enjoy anime. For some reason though, whenever a dude tells me they *really* like anime I assume they are also really into hentai and that creeps me out. 

I’ve had a tiny bit too many drinks. Liquid courage. So I will wrap this up so I can dance and sing horribly. 


Maybe what I said has piqued some interest in you. In that case you should totally PM me cause that’s what you’re supposed to do on here. Otherwise you just wasted a lot of time reading this for no reason.

Well look no further! Introducing the all new onm4! This awesome example of a male specimen was crafted with creativity, wit, humor, and we a sprinkled in a bit of good looks. He's ready to be everything you are looking for!


But why take our word for it, why don't you hear what others have to say about him 

""He's such a special boy"" - *onm4's mom*

""He's actually pretty funny"" - *your brain right now*

""He's so hot and funny"" - *some words we strung together to make him look good*



I know what you're thinking, *""I want to know more""*. Well here are some FAQ's we put together just for you


**Q: Is he actually good looking?**

*A: does a bear shit in the woods?*^your ^results ^may ^vary

**Q: How old do I have to be?**

*A: are you old enough to drink, but young enough to not use a seniors discount? Then you're old enough for this ride!*

**Q: Where does this fine male specimen come from?**

*A: from the land of lumberjacks, cold weather and canoes*

**Q: Is he able to actually hold a conversation?**

*A: does a cow drink water?*

**Q: What if I can't contain myself and want to throw my vagina at him?**

*A: we ask that all vagina throwers take a number. Your request will be handled on a first come first serve basis.* (.... see what we did there.. *wink*)


**So whats next?**


With a 3 easy clicks (and a few smashes on the keyboard, that hopefully resemble words that are meant to be beside each other), you'll get you're very own response from onm4. Print it out, brag to your friends about it, or reply back to him, it's all up to you!

But wait, there's more! If you act now, you won't get one, you won't get two, but you'll get, *at least*, three, well written sentences that onm4 will put together just for you!

I'm short for a guy, at 5'6"". I can't change that. Some guys will fudge the truth on something that is so basic. I won't. Honesty is super-important to me, both in myself and others. While I may be marginally height-impaired for a guy, I am also quite athletic--between exercising a few minutes every day, eating healthily, sleeping decently, and just generally taking care of myself, I'm in great shape. Muscular and trim with a flat stomach--I've kicked it up another notch, beginning my training and preparation for a mountaineering expedition in September.

I am a little more sensitive than most guys.  I need to have good, open communication with my partner.  This isn't to say that I am a weeping mess without a backbone.  I need to be with someone who gives a damn--even when it's not convenient for her--because I am that kind of person myself.  Feeling desired and appreciated are very important to me.  I need someone who won't throw the baby out with the bathwater over a misunderstanding. I promise the same.  My friend Robyn says that my open heart is my greatest strength as well as my greatest weakness. 

Most people can't honestly claim to be the total package. I believe I can.

**Why I am the perfect man:**

I am clean and smell good all the time. My beard is soft and typically neatly groomed.  My teeth are all present and accounted for, and in proper order. I am perfectly capable of dressing myself properly and stylishly. I have no diseases or health problems of any kind, and I am looking to keep things that way. I don't have any tattoos or piercings, but that's simply not my style--I won't judge you for having a few, or not having any. I am pretty darn good at giving massages. Personal hygiene is important to me--it is a sign of respect for myself and for those around me. I've still got my beard from Mo-vember, but have tamed it since then.  Who knew that facial hair lead to constant compliments?  I am confident enough in my masculinity that I have a pink shirt--it looks amazing on me, so I actually wear it. I am not hung up about sex, our bodies, or talking about them. Or talking about feelings. In fact, being able to do this is really important to me.

I have had my own place for the last four years. I have a decent, late-model car that I finished paying off two years early.  I have spent the last nine years growing and operating a prospering business that I started when I graduated high school. In other words, I am responsible, successful and have my shit together. I am a self-made man who has earned every accomplishment he has. At times, my schedule can be hectic, but it is always flexible. I can and will find or make time for the important people in my life, even if it can seem like my head is in the sand. I don't have any kids--unless you count my faithful, affectionate, and fuzzy animal companion. I love to travel and learn about other cultures. I just need to get the travel part down more seriously--now that I have the means I find that time is in short supply.  Six of one, a half dozen of the other, aye?

I am always open to and enjoy learning and trying new things. I love blues and classic rock (and a lot more), but listen to podcasts and audiobooks constantly.  Being someone who is easily-distracted, I attempt to tilt my own lifestyle more towards order than chaos--a generally successful effort to keep myself sane. However, I feel that spontaneity and variety are very important to keep life interesting. I try to push my comfort zones and to avoid falling into routines. I'll admit when I'm wrong (once I realize it) and would always rather talk through problems than let them stew and boil over. I'm looking for the same. If we make plans, I will not flake out on you. Nor will I flake on you--no dandruff, here. I'm all for gender equality and I would say that I am a feminist, perhaps more truthfully than some ""actual feminists"". I'll still treat you to dinner and open the door for you, though. 

I once had an awkward date--just to see what it was like.

A few traits that may be important--I am atheist/agnostic, with a great regard for the nature of reality and the beauty and complexity of the universe around us. I love learning about/discussing all kinds of social and environmental issues. I recycle like a fiend.  Also, I effing love science, especially medicine/biology and anything related to space.

I am child-free, meaning that I do not want children--I am perfectly content being ""Uncle Matt"" to my friends' children as they grow, and putting some of that time, energy, and money towards helping them become wonderful, intelligent, and worldly people, as well as helping others who are less fortunate and doing what I can to make the world a better place. I feel I can do so much more good by--and be much happier with--simply not reproducing, and there are many more reasons that brought me to this lifestyle and this decision--something that always makes for fascinating conversation.

The woman I am looking for is attractive, bright, and in good shape. She around my age or younger, but has something to teach me. This lovely lady is my height or shorter. Just looking at her gives me butterflies in the stomach--physical attraction is very important to me, but that is a prerequisite rather that a defining characteristic. She enjoys learning, discovering, and trying new things. She has a healthy sense of humor with some sass and sarcasm. Someone who can stand on her own, but isn't afraid to ask for help or lean on others. She is patient and understanding with the people she cares about, but is not afraid to speak up when something bothers or upsets her. She enjoys coffee, tea, and a good beer, glass of wine, or cocktail--all in moderation. She is healthy and active--even athletic--doesn't have any significant allergies, and is a bit of a foodie who enjoys variety.  Perhaps she likes Monty Python and all manner of other geeky stuff. Maybe all of the above? I'm looking for someone who, like myself, is the real thing. She is enthusiastic, curious, and inspired. She is capable of being my best friend as well as my lover. She has her act together mentally, emotionally, and physically--to a similar extent that I have mine--and we share all or most of the important stuff in common. She has a passion or three in life. Maybe that's you. Maybe she's a friend or relative of yours. I don't know. All I know is that I'm not you, nor am I a witch.

Don't be shy--write me and tell me a little about yourself.  The basics obviously, but also... What were the last couple books you read? Do you have the world's greatest taste in music? What was your most awkward moment in high school? Tell me about it, ask me a couple questions, and send a few photos--we'll go from there!  Perhaps meet up for coffee/tea/happy hour?

[Here's me!](http://imgur.com/a/y0fyX)

Also, if we aren't a match but you liked my post, let me know! Constructive criticism is appreciated, too.

I look forward to hearing from you :)

*Edit: Thank you for all the compliments and responses!  Additionally, one of my goals for the next year is to divorce my income from geographic location so that I can travel extensively--perhaps even perpetually live abroad.

How it will work: Hopefully at least once a day, we will have an exchange of questions. These can be as deep, frivolous, sexual or banal as you like. This can be through pm or email, whatever (not chat, not looking for immediate responses). I won't supply any info that you don't ask for, and I ask that you do the same.

I promise to answer any question you ask me as long as it isn't identifying info (address, phone number, etc).

I might be okay with exchanging pictures at some point, but understand that I'm not looking to meet up. Do not consider me a potential girlfriend/real-life friend, as I fear this will cause bias in your responses to me.

I won't (to the best of my ability) be judgmental. I do have one requirement: you have to be a competent writer/typer. Capitalized letters and punctuation and such. 

I'm not expecting a flood of responses or anything, but in case I end up having to choose someone, please try and interject a little bit of your personality in your response to me. You can respond here or pm me, I don't care.

Feeling starved of meaningful human interaction lately. I like meeting new people, and I like reddit. So here's to having the two together.

I'm a college student in my twenties studying humanities and social sciences. Outside of school I do things like graphic design, poke around the internet, art. Just tryna live my life. I like travel. If there's one thing I have a huge passion for it's food. Oh wait, no, the other thing I have a passion for is social movements and revolutions and that kind of thing. Food and social movements then. I like it when the underdog sticks it to the system. Even if they usually lose. 

Kurt Vonnegut, Catcher in the Rye (Yeah I'm one of those people that totally related to this in high school but I now like it mainly for the nostalgia factor), Gabriel Garcia Marquez. 

Charlie Chaplin, Quentin Tarantino. I'm no film buff, just like watching movies. Appreciate some good cinematography. 

My humor is weird and goofy and awkward and dry at times and lame at others. It might take me a few minutes to open up. I am weird sometimes. Boop. 

So, like I said, I have a few hours to kill and would like to spend them getting to know someone. I'm looking for someone who is nice and also someone who is cute. My type... I usually like white guys, older than 20. I am open to whatever your hobbies/interests are. It's usually just personality traits that matter. Like being nice and not being pretentious. Me, I'm 5'2"" and asian. I can send you a pic if you'd like. 

I know a lot of people here are into video games and computers, from my past experiences with R4R. The extent of my video game experience is super mario brothers. It's totally cool if you're into games, but you should know I don't enjoy talking about them. 

So I'm just looking for some casual conversation via skype. Hopefully we'll click and can become chat buddies. Chicken butt.",,False,,t5_2rn0e,True,,,True,t3_plu48,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/plu48/f_wants_to_connect/,

Well, I obviously couldn't think of something smarter to say in the title. But i'm gonna try harder here.

I'm 22 years old. I'm from Asia. And I do sometimes mess up my pronunciations of the letter 'r' when I speak too fast. I can be rather shy and quiet when I meet someone new. But i'll be annoying as fuuuu once I feel comfortable with them.

I like colours. I like stars in the night sky. I like animals. I like pillows. I like books. I don't like people bending my books till there's a crease in the middle of the spine. I don't like wet socks. I don't like construction noises in the morning.

I'm not really sure what are the requirements to be categorized as a gamer. The only games I've ever completed were God of War 1 &amp; 2, Silent Hill 1 &amp; 2, and Patapon 2 on my PSP. Although I did also complete Pokemon Yellow when I was much younger.

I like listening to music whenever I can and create music videos in my head for the songs i'm listening to. Currently, i'm listening to ""Don't you Remember"" by Adele while trying to lip sync while looking like I just got dumped, san the tears. I won't reveal what bands i'm into so you get to ask me 'So,what bands are you into?'.:D

If you want to know more about me, just PM me and i'll read it and then i'll reply then you'll reply then i'll reply. Or don't. But do. Please.

Well,I guess that's all I have to say for now. My fingers are getting cold. Bye.

[This is me looking at you seductively.](http://imgur.com/eIhxZ)

I'm not looking for anything in particular. Sure, I'd like to make out with you, but we're not drunk enough for that yet.
 
Let's flirt. 

Let's write poems. 

Let's dick around. 

I like food and things that are exotic and morbid and random. You know those lists you find on the internet? ""10 shitty things you didn't know, and will never be relevant in your life!"" I dig that. 

I watch adventure time and anime and have a soft spot for asian dramas, probably because I'm asian. On a similar note, I'm also a fan of kpop, mostly for the hot guys. They are young and delicious. 

I like video games. I also suck sour balls at them. I also cosplay....male characters. This is because my boobs are tiny. NOT SO INTERESTED NOW ARE YOU. 

I'm awkward and sarcastic and terribly shy in real life. I'm stupid and cocky and naive and don't know anything about the world, but I want to go there. I want to go everywhere and see everything. 


And I'm not good at this. I'm not good at making friends, and even less so at getting into relationships. But if there anywhere I can be as daring and cute and bold as I would like to be, it's here. 


So call me maybe? 

EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm open for friendship, possibly relationship, of both sexes. Yes, I'm a wild one.

I am bisexual and currently have a boyfriend, whom I live with.  This may seem like a strange request, but I could not find an appropriate subreddit and this seemed like the closest thing.  If anyone knows a better place to post this, please let me know.

I'm looking for someone to essentially share my life story with and to get to know/talk to, and if they are open, hear their life story in return!  I have had the feeling lately that I really want to go over everything in my life that has brought me to today, and to share it with somebody.  I have told many different people parts and pieces of my life story, but I don't know if I have ever told anyone all of it, and every truth (pretty and ugly), even my SO.  Some days I feel like a horrible person, and some days I feel pretty awesome.  Some days I feel like I've been unlucky in life, and yet others I feel like I'm the luckiest woman in the world.

We can share information with each other as we gain trust with each other.

To get an idea of any interests or experiences we may share in common, I will list some information below.

**Some Interests**

* Video Games
* Computer Programming
* Going to the Casino
* Sometimes Drinking
* Watching TV Shows/Movies at Home
* Everything Internet!
* My Career
* My Beagle, Jasmyn, and my Abysinnian Cat, Aby
* Spending time with my Significant Other, whom I live with
* Shopping Online
* Deals &amp; Freebies
* Crafts such as making hemp bracelets, decorating, and sewing (Busy-work)
* Puzzles such as Sudoku and Fill-Ins
* Still trying to figure out my place in the world and what I like...

**Some Experiences**

* Depression/Self-Harm/Suicidal Ideation
* Anxiety and High Stress
* Drug Addiction
* Drug (And Mental Health) Treatment Centers, AA, NA, etc.
* Loneliness
* Promiscuity
* Low Self Worth
* Setting Unrealistic Expectations for Myself
* Love/Heartbreak
* Homelessness
* Kicked out as a Youth
* Living in Poverty/Debt
* Growing up with money and without
* Legal Troubles/Potential for Legal Troubles
* Over-Achievement and Under-Achievement
* Sexual Assault Victim
* Being Cheated on
* Abuse victim
* Mother is a Cancer Survivor
* Sexual Molestation in the Immediate Family
* Losing a very close friend to Drug Overdose

I know a lot of these may seem heavy or TMI, but as I said before, I want to share my story with nothing held back or redacted.  I think I want to share it as we get to know each other (not all at once), from beginning to now.  Hopefully, if you're willing, as we gain trust with each other you can share pieces of your story.  I don't have a lot of these issues any more, but all of them have helped me grow into the woman I am today.  I swear I'm not some crazy lady or anything, just please try to keep an open mind, and we'll see if we click!

Thanks for reading through this, I will be super super grateful if someone is willing to do this with me, and I think it will be even more awesome if another person is willing to do the same.  You can use a throwaway if you'd like.

EDIT:  Thank you for the responses everyone!  I am trying to get to everyone who messaged me right now, feel free to PM if you are still interested!  :)

EDIT2:  I know I posted this not too long ago, but I am DOG tired from work this week and *need* to lay down right now.

Cheesiness aside, I am unabashedly attracted to larger/voluptuous/curvy/plus-sized women. This isn't a fetish, it's just a preference. 

Essentially, I just want someone to keep me company during those wee-hours of the night. I'm a full-time worker/student, which doesn't provide me a lot of time for social interaction during the day.

Me: -African American (because that matters to some people)
-6'1. Slim, but well-toned build. I've been told I'm handsome!

-25 years of age

-Mellowest guy in the world. Seriously. I'm a 'go with the flow' type. I'm not a SAP or anything of the sort; I actually have a fine time striking up conversations with new people. 

-Intelligent, charming, AND modest (honest).

-Wide range of interests in regards to pop culture (music, movies, television, etc.) I'd rather discuss this rather than put up a long list of bands and artists. However, top-five genres include: 1. Post-rock. 2. R&amp;B. 3. Indie-alternative. 4. Trip-hop (look it up) 5. Korean/Japanese music. (I have a crapton of anime OST's... don't judge me)

I do not discriminate in terms of race, location (locals would be cool, though!), age (be legal), or physical appearance. You'd be surprised what I find attractive, so don't be shy about contacting me. Other than that, the title says it all.

I am a monster and I mainly wear tweed. I am fair-haired, bearded and ferocious when roused. I believe that light beer is the invention of the Anti-Christ and that polyester is His war on my comfort. I speak Irish and French and curse fluently in both. I jump or get startled during scary films. I read comics, books and like film noir.

I am 5'11"", 14 stone and wear glasses. Yes I really am from the west of Ireland, it is as damp as they say. I will bore you to death with history and analysis if you like, or just make you a nice dinner.

Some of my interests include Donegal tweed, Irish linen, tailoring, silk weaving, Japanese knives and marmalade making.

I love buying American.

If my views are not incompatible with yours, you have an erotic imagination (not everyone does) and you're less heavy than me we could be an item. One way to find out.

In general I like brunettes with curly hair, but what's inside is what really matters such as: Can you knit? Can you sew, are you kind to the servants?  Can you recognise sarcasm/humour when you see it?

Have boots will travel, if you're far away I will have you flown to me so we can initially be really excited and then gradually come down to earth as we realise that we're both flawed humans.

Dating is fucking hard. Finding someone with similar interests, acceptable physical traits, and within your boundaries of intelligence are unlikely enough. For most guys (and some girls), it's an uphill battle - always has been, probably always will be. Putting yourself out there and not getting a response is not rejection of you as a person, and don't take it as such. Keep looking. People will respond if/when they find something they like about you.

And hey, guess what, someone may be initially attracted to you and then decide you're not the right one for them. You may decide you're not right for them. The dating stops, maybe you're friends, maybe not. You move on, they move on, and the cycle continues.

Guys, you just have to get over yourselves here and keep on keepin' on.

Anyway, on with the information you are seeking.

I'm an 18 year old (some say, mature for my age) high school student who is going to be graduating come June. I have plans to go to college and have a goal of one day becoming a dentist. Physically I am about 5'7'', relatively white, curvy and well proportioned (that isn't code for land-whale) with glasses, and green eyes. I spend most of my time online at home, but love to go out and enjoy a nice evening or go camping, hiking, swimming, and walking whenever I'm not. I'm pretty adventurous in the sense that I love to travel, explore things which are new to me, and will try *almost* anything at least once.

I love to bake and cook. Aside from making food I also love eating food. I enjoy trying all sorts of cuisines and have a special place in my heart (or maybe, my stomachs 'heart') for Italian and Thai food. I enjoy watching movies of all kinds, and tend to watch anything if it's recommended or seems to catch my eye. Occasionally I play some video games - this can be anything from Skyrim, to Mariokart, to Wii bowling. I'm told I am a good friend and an honest individual but I'll let you (my so-far faithful reader) be the judge of that.
I'll stop now so we have things to talk about.

**A general run down on what I'm looking for, I suppose:** A guy who is intelligent, cute (because who doesn't love a nice face?) and talented without being too arrogant. He should like to watch good movies and read good books, it doesn't matter too much if his taste varies from mine. In fact, arguing the merits of a film or book can be fun. He should be able and willing to have (sometimes deep) conversations with me about politics, philosophy, history, science etc. He should have lofty goals, but not be too disappointed if he never achieves them. It's important to pursue something significant even if it's always out of reach. He should enjoy going on little adventures, even if that just means driving somewhere nearby we haven't been before and exploring a bit, but he should also be cool with relaxing and doing nothing in particular sometimes. He should like video games, or at least be cool with me occasionally getting absorbed in one. He should also like a wide variety of good food, trying new cuisines, traveling, learning about and exploring foreign cultures, etc.

I'm open to long distance and long term relationships with (single) guys ages 20-26 (preferably).

I work as a simple clerk at the local Polish shop, which means I switch from one language to another every day. ;) I like my job, although, I must admit, it gets quite tiring in a physical matter. Well... who cares- I get payed for getting tired!  I'm goofy and I tend to joke around a lot; if you like that, too, seems like we'll get along well!

It was always my biggest dream to see America, and once that finally happened, it became one of my favorite places to be in. I've seen LA (GAWD, THE BEST PLACE EVUUUUR!) and the most important places around LA, Disneyland in Anaheim, Santa Monica, Las Vegas in Nevada, and much, much more. SoCal has a special place in my heart and I hope to come back there this year, too. Last year two people that I know hosted me. 

I'd like to meet people who love to travel or who live around these places, so we could share experiences and impressions. :) I hope that next year I'll be lucky enough to go to LA to study or just move to CA in general, to live there! Of course, I'm also interested in other places in the U.S. so people from all other  states- don't hesitate to write! ^^ If you'd like to know me better, feel free to message me and I'll gladly talk to all of you. :) ",,False,,t5_2rn0e,False,,,True,t3_qhhnx,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/qhhnx/23_year_old_looking_for_friends/,

**Likes:**  
* Writing (poetry)  
* Observing/analyzing people  
* Anime (but so much that I become the ever-undesirable weeaboo)  
* Words (I treat words/syntax like my children and take care to use them as best and perfectly as I can)  
* Literature (Shakespeare nerd~)  
* Music (I'm proud to announce that I've a myriad of genres I enjoy, with the exception of mainsteam hip-hop/rap and mostly mainstream.. everything. But not in that hipster kind of way, XD)  
* Intelligence  
* Old cartoons (From the ""Popeye"" era to the Toonami era)  
* Other introverts/quiet/shy people

**Dislikes:**  
* Unintelligent people  
* People who do not respect their parents without good reason  
* New Cartoon Network  
* Pseudo-intellectuals

**Disregards:**  
* Physical aesthetics (it's not a quintessential factor, but it matters)  
* Mental/physical ailments (in fact, I will enjoy you even more if you have some kind of mental ailment--schizophrenia, depression, so on--because I enjoy analyzing the behavior and, well, mental illnesses interest me!)

**A bit more about myself:** I'm not very emotionally.. here. It's incredibly difficult for me to romantically love anyone--*incredibly* difficult--and I really have a bit of neurotic behavior to me. I forbid people from touching me unless they are given permission or are on a list of people allowed to touch me. It's a list I carry every day, everywhere.

Recently, I've discovered my love for applying independent movies to my manner of thinking and generally trying things from movies. You can catch me watching indie drama/romance movies often. It's no secret that I very much enjoy movie soundtracks (especially indie ones) and will scour the interwebz for a download of it.

If you aren't turned off completely at this point, hooray for me! And you, I suppose! Send a comment, ask any questions and let's get to know each other, yeah?

CluckTheDuck 2 points 3 hours ago* 
I can agree with this post. I'm not up to date with all Internet law, but the fact that r4r was not labeled adult only can create an interesting legal issue. Nudes that are posted to r4r are accessible by underage users, and a NSFW tag does not constitute 'adult content'. Therefore, if a 12 year old girl sees a big (tagged NSFW or not) and is scarred, the family has a tort and might have a case in court because the forum was not officially 18+. Labeling the forum as 18+ OFFICIALLY removes liability from the poster, mods, and reddit and places the liability on the kid and parents.
R4R needs to be 18+ unless it specifically and officially bans any and all adult content. This would require extremely dedicated moderating. The best and most sensible option is making it 18+ and leaving it up to someone else to create an /r/teenr4r where the stated rules of no adult content could and would be strictly enforced.


Anyways, I'm sure there's some way to CODE in to where not every post has an NSFW tag, but currently I do not know how and we do not have someone who can code on the mod team yet. So please bare with us while we work on this. Your patience is appreciated. 

**I am so freaking dumb UPDATE!!**
I think I just figured out if you put ""NSFW"" in your title that the red NSFW tag comes up next to your post, right? Well, that's fine and dandy. But I just posted in modhelp to see if there is anyway to make it to w here even though the forum is set at 18+, the posts will still default to not having a NSFW tag. More updates coming.

**!!!Another update!!!**

So, I've gotten a few responses from modhelp and the outlook doesn't look great. Someone did give me a CSS code that might help but I haven't had time to play around with it yet. I do yet again apologize for the inconvenience and I know some people are upset. Krayer and I only want to help improve the community and really the only plans we had going in to this was to clean up the side bar. The making the forum 18+ idea came when Krayer asked for suggestions in a post to the subreddit. Someone suggested it and we got some feed back from others that agreed then we discussed it. I went and checked the option and bam came back and there was nothing but NSFW tags every where. I did NOT realize it was going to do this. I didn't know how it would affect the forum at all, which is why I did it; to see what the result would be.

Anyways, we'll see how this all unfolds. We're still working, don't think we have forgotten about you guys. ",,True,,t5_2rn0e,True,,,True,t3_oy978,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/oy978/nsfw_tags/,moderator

At this point you're probably interested, but are now wondering about the young woman who will be accompanying you on this random (yet fun-filled) date. Simply put, I'm a college student whose interests include music, most things science fiction or fantasy related, Shakespeare, travel, and bacon. With regard to looks, I'd say I'm above average, but I'm willing to exchange pictures to let you find out for yourself.

I am a big fan of true love, and I am quite the sweet, romantic woman.  I do want a man that enjoys having good conversations that loves to cuddle and be sweet.

I am into a lot of things... Reading, standing up for the things I believe in such as LGBT rights, and enjoying a hookah smoking session (no cigarettes) with ent friendliness weren't just college pastimes, but what I still do to this day.

A little bit more about my ideal man... Besides being romantic and affectionate (of course!) I would want a committed relationship of substance and sweetness with a patient, smart, understanding man with a sense of humor.  I also want him to be a childfree man as well or leaning towards not wanting kids (meaning: does not have nor want children at all).  It's something that I do feel strongly about.  I do prefer a man that is not religious, atheist, even. I'm also a black woman that is attracted to white men and I've always felt that way.

About me. I am a 22 year old XX chromosome with green eyes, brown curly hair and eye brows to kill for. Women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one until their bald Jerry! Bald above the eyes! And then they paint on eyebrows to look like that.

I like video games like bioshock and skyrim and league of legands and and and unreal tournament. I have a bazillion games on my steam. I need to play them all at some point. 

I like b horror movies and just sort of shitty movies in general. I also like reality Tv since we're on the topic of toxic waste.

I like poop and fart jokes.

I love cats and dogs. I have both, they're living together and it is infact mass hysteria.

I enjoy being outside like camping and hiking and fishing (fly fishing is amazing I honestly encourage everyone to try it) I don't like bugs though. I mean I appreciate them and I like to look at them. I don't like them flying at my face or hair. Have you ever noticed the bigger the bug the less motor control?

Its hard to sell yourself man I tell yewwhat!

Then a disembodied voice says, ""do you randomly catch on fire while doing the dishes? Well no more! Thanks to sicklypaperdoll you'll now never experience the hassle of spontaneous combustion....""

We've seen all your posts talking about /r/r4r. We know that it is a good idea to keep the flow of communication with the community constantly moving. Being in an open environment like reddit helps you guys share issues that you have about the subreddit, but also helps us figure out solutions for all your problems.

So, the mods have decided to open up a new tag: [meta].

**What is it?:**

As you would have guessed, the [meta] tag is strictly to talk about /r/r4r, ask for advice on your posts, and submit success stories!

**What Can I Post?:**

This is not to ask about relationship advice, to bash another member, and to just be bitter all over the subreddit. The [meta] tag is for you to use when you notice something about /r/r4r and you want to share it with the rest of the community. Did you have a great date with someone you met on /r/r4r? Go ahead and post your success story under the [meta] tag.

We will gladly welcome all [meta] posts unless the mods find that they are hurtful and not suitable for a [meta] tag.

**How to Use the Tag:**

There is no reason for you to put your age, [r4r], location, and title like you traditionally would. Just start out your post with [meta] and your title.

For example:

[meta] Can we stop saying PM'd in the comments? She got it. She knows.

[meta] Just had a great date with someone I met from r4r!

**Questions?:**

We know this is all new territory, so if you have any questions regarding your new [meta] post or any other r4r post, please feel free to [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r)!

(A lot MIC) {NSFW/18+}",needtotryit,41,14,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/vprg2/30sw4m_east_coast_usa_id_like_to_try_pegging_for/,"I'm aware this is an unusual request and that I would have more success on fetlife or a similar site. Before I go down that road, I was curious about the level of interest here.

I'm a 30-something, full-figured, asian female with a kink for male prostate/anal play.  I've had some irl experience with fingers and toys and find it extremely arousing to pleasure a man like this (especially combined with a blow job/hand job).  If you're a male who's experienced this properly, you know how intense and mind-blowing the orgasms are... it's seriously one of the hottest things for me to be a part of.  I can't help but wonder how erotic it would be to experience with a strap-on.  Because of this, I've been fantasizing about pegging a willing partner for several months now... the thought of trying it irl excites me very much.

For the record, I'm not looking to peg just any willing guy, and I'm not a Mistress seeking a sub (although there is certainly a time and place for that ;P ).   
I'm seeking a mutual interest, attraction, and connection *first*.  I suppose in a way, this is more of a ""W seeking M who is compatible and happens to be interested in pegging too"" post.  I'd like my first time to be as comfortable, pleasurable, and memorable as possible.  If it happens to be your first time too, I would hope to give you a similarly positive experience. 

My current preferences are as follows:

* Single (this means **no** GF/BF, fiancee, nada.  No exceptions.)

* Straight male (but open to bisexuals.)

* Some experience in anal play, not necessarily pegging.  It's ok if you don't have experience; just need to be very open to it.  Also, at the very least, please have put a finger in your ass before you claim you're into butt play. ;P

* Prefer literate, college educated, 22-50 yr olds with a job, and not living at home.

* Must be discrete and trustworthy.

* Not psychotic/a stalker/a serial killer.

I left out a specific location because if I find the right partner(s) (laugh), I'm open to traveling a bit.  The truth is, I'm less apt to respond if you're too close since discretion is a must.

I'm fairly good with shy, somewhat awkward people; I'm often attracted to them more.  I've been told that I'm good at making people feel comfortable so please, feel free to send a PM. :)

**To save time for everyone, please include the following info in your PM:**

* Age, location, level of experience with anal play/pegging, and a description of what you look like (height, build, skin/eye/hair color, etc.).  
  
* I'd also love a little info about you: your personality, likes and dislikes, hobbies, etc.

* Also, please include where you would rate yourself on a scale of 1-10: 1 = extremely submissive, 10 = extremely dominant.  If you're a switch (like me), please let me know. 

If you're willing to share a pic (no, I'm not asking for penis pics ;P), please, by all means... but I certainly don't expect one right away.

If the experience goes well, I'd obviously be interested in making it a regular thing or perhaps, developing the relationship. 

If you're still reading *and* with interest, you should send me a PM. :)


**ADDENDUM:**  Thank you so much to everyone who has PM'd so far. :D  I'm truly blown away at the level of interest and apologize if I haven't gotten back to you yet (I've been working very long shifts since I posted with minimal free time).    
I'm going to do my best to respond to everyone (even if it's to say 'no, thank you') but honestly, this is going to take several days, maybe more than a week, so please, bear with me.  No news isn't necessarily bad news. ;)

For those who are thinking about PMing: in this instance, less is not more.  If you provide minimal information about yourself in a 1-2 liner, you can pretty much guarantee I won't be interested.  This post took a little time and effort on my part.  I don't think it's unfair to ask a bit of the same from you.  

Off to work... Cheers :D

Basically I want a threesome. Preferably with two STRAIGHT guys! I already have one guy willing to do this and I want one more. I have done this before and I think I am pretty good at multitasking :P.... But its been a few years.

I don't need to see anything sexy - this is going to be hilarious the first time and then if we do it again it might get better.  But I want it soon!

As for me I'm a funky geek and I will spend this threesome with 50/50 moaning and laughing my ass off - its all about fun.  I'm 25 years old and people assure me that I'm cute.  

That being said I'd be interested in meeting girls or couples too but I would still like this doubleteam. If all goes well it'll be something we can do every month or so - no strings attached.

But, *I PROMISE* I will reply to every message I've received, and I'm going to do it in order I received them. I'm very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the messages too - you guys are funny ^ ^ .**  

**I'm also pleased to announce that I have received a total of 0 pictures of anatomy, although there was a very nice cat gif. :)** 

**Wow, I need to shut up and go to bed (-.-)**


First of all: I don't want *any* pictures; not of faces, not of dicks, not of any other body part of which you may be exceptionally proud, ok? Although,...maybe of cats, I might just let you off if it's cats = ^ . ^ = 

On a related note, if you ask for my picture it will be a no. If looks are that important to you, then we're probably not gonna get on, (I'm not a hideous swamp creature, but I know for a fact that I'm not the supermodel girl of your dreams either; let's try and establish a bond first, then maybe we will forgive each other's physical imperfections).

**About me:**

* Shy and awkward but warm and affectionate once I get to know someone. 
* Generally quite sarcastic and silly, with a generous streak of misanthropy thrown in the mix. 

* Forgiving of neuroses and insecurities as I suffer from them myself. 

Oh, I sound delightful, don't I? :D

**You:** (hopefully, but not necessarily) 

* Have a daft sense of humour and don't take yourself at all seriously.

* Have similar interests to me as I'm not so good at making conversation if there's no common ground. 

* Are kind and thoughtful. 

* Are able to communicate. 


In terms of interests and whatnot: I'm a retired semi-otaku (I used to play video games and watch anime, but seem to have grown out of them. I don't have encyclopaedic knowledge of either though). I love reading, travelling and cycling through the countryside; and I play the flute and taiko badly.

Oh, apparently I also love formatting (-.-)

I could go into more detail about interests, but  I've probably already written more than enough. If you think you are interested, --------&gt; pm ^ ^

I do: Work, read, hike, drink, watch too much TV &amp; too many movies, talk to my cat, date and get frustrated by dating (hence this post). 


I look like: Brown hair, brown eyes, ghostly white usually but 'tan' now. 5'5'' and a little overweight. That means I can shop in the 'straight size' stores but quite realize I have thick hips/thighs. Boobs are B-ish, not huge, sorry.


You are: 21-40, roundabouts. (I tend to attract guys younger than me but am open to most ages.) 'Smart' and 'kind' should be self-explanatory. By 'safe' I mean a) that you are disease-free b) you are ready to use condoms each &amp; every time c) I can trust you to be discreet and d) you are sane enough for me to share talk, time, and sex with you. 


You do: Read, think, hang out in the outdoors, or other nerdy things.


You look like: Medium height to tall, anywhere from average sized to somewhat overweight. Physical chemistry to me is usually more dependent on conversational repartee than a specific looks template. 


I'm single and you should be too. If I get a whiff of a girlfriend/wife (unless an immediately disclosed open relationship), I am outta there.

I am having a very hard time dealing with it on top of my normal depression. Basically, to sum this all up, I am emotionally intense. You might consider that dramatic but besides my sadness and heartbreak, I'm generally not a drama filled person. Just so you know, I am taking strides to get better. 

Now, onto my good side or maybe I should just say my 'normal' side. You should probably read my previous post here http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/v5npg/22f4mf_looking_for_local_friend_or_relationship/ . 

Personality-wise, I am strong, honest, straight-forward, smart, sarcastic, caring, dedicated, somewhat creative, somewhat logical. I take pride in looking presentable whenever I go out. Some of my worse traits are that I can be a little self-absorbed (not on purpose), needy, stubborn, and defeatist. However, I am basically just a nerd. I go to school for Computer Programming and Database Management at Cincinnati State. When I'm not doing schoolwork, I have way too much free-time especially because I can't handle a job at this moment in time. So, as you probably already assumed, I do play lots of video games. I love Fallout, Elder Scrolls, fighting games, and WoW. Once I am bored of that, I will probably watch T.V. I love Law and Order or pretty much any crime show. And reality T.V. Just for shits and giggles. I'm not huge into movies but some of my favorites are the Book of Eli, La Moustache, and Gamer. Sometimes, when I get bored of watching or listening to T.V., I will listen to music. I love electronic and hip-hop because it makes me want to dance. Which I randomly do sometimes around my room. 

What I am looking for is a friend (female preferably) or a relationship. A companion of some sort. I'd like to hang out as much as possible. I'm fine with just chilling and talking, going to a park for a walk, or anything else cheap unless you want to pay. I'd be fine if you just wanted to join me in laying in my bed with my crazy, sweet puppy, Jemma, and watching T.V. Maybe you could get me into Star Wars or something else I've never seen. Maybe you could help me get back into volunteering or photography, both of which I used to love doing. Perhaps, you have a console and a fighting game and I can whoop your ass. I just don't want to be alone and entertain any thoughts that are going to make me more stuck than I am now. I can say that if we get close that I will be your dedicated friend. I will give you almost everything I have to offer. I will do a lot to make you feel loved. 

Please don't message me if you beat around the bush a lot. I don't need to waste time on bullshit when you can just be straight forward with me. Just tell me what you motherfucking want.

Second of all, hi! I'm 18, and looking to settle down pretty young. I know it's a long shot, posting this here, but why not? It can't hurt. 

I am planning to attend college in the fall, but I'm not sure what I want to study. Maybe psychology... it really interests me to find out how people tick. An education is SUPER important to me, but I don't think a career will be my focus for awhile... Honestly, I want a family. I will probably get called out for subscribing to gender stereotypes here, but what I want is the typical family dynamic. I'm looking for a partner!

I would be a very good house wife. I am a great cook and love to bake... I am great at organizing things, like budgets or my living space. But at the same time, I am a pretty intelligent person, love to read and learn, and can hold a great conversation. I also clean up pretty well. I am great at researching things, bargain hunting, and make a mean batch of brownies :) I love to do little things for my friends to make them smile, like send cards or care packages randomly and without warning. In my spare time, I love to read, go to museums, and watch stuff on Netflix. 

I am a spiritual person. I was raised Catholic, but I am a very open minded and accepting person. I'm not sure I would raise my future children in any one church, but educate them on what religions are out there and accept their decisions regarding it when they get to a certain age. Though I do not do it for religious reasons, I have also not had sex. I'm waiting for a serious relationship to do that.

I'm pretty open minded on what I'm looking for. Honestly I always picture myself as settling down with someone in the military, but that's just what I picture. I am looking for a life partner! 

Thanks everyone :)


**edit:** I've gone to sleep for the night, but all messages will get responses in due course. Please send messages!! I don't bite (unless you ask) Thanks everyone :)

**edit2:** Hey everyone, I've been inundated with messages (:D), I just apologize for taking so long to respond. I just got home from work and now have to go run some errands and I'm actually having a sleep study tonight, so I'm unsure of how available I'll be in the next 18 hours.

We all know it's better than posting on /r/foreveralonedating, that's just a sad sad place. 

A little about me: I'm a long time lurker, have sent a few PMs to some girls that seemed cool, but never got any responses. SO I figured I'd post for once, see what happens. I'm 23, from NJ, I like to talk, a lot, about anything and everything, as long as the other person can withhold the conversation and I don't feel like I'm talking to myself (like right now). I like video games (obviously, I'm a redittor), music like the Black Keys and the Strokes, shows like Adventure Time and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I read lots of books, LOVE movies, and am a pretty good looking guy if I don't say so myself. Okay that's enough about me. I'm about to leave for work so leave me some love to come back to and hopefully we can have a good convo later tonight. Dudes need not apply, as well as anybody under 18. Don't let me down ladies.

EDIT: Just got outta work, was not expecting 40 comments, looks like I got some reading to do

Edit2: Everybody makes a lot of good points here, ones I didn't really think of (epically that girls who comment must get flooded with PMs, totally makes sense). It was too early to think too much when I posted this. Glad to see it get so many comments though. I might be going out to the bar tonight with a couple of friends, but I'll be on for a couple hours until then if anyone wants to chat just send me a PM and I'll get back to yah later on tonight.

So here's the deal. Shoot an email to

**RedditOrgy@Yahoo.com**

With your info, why you should attend, basically, any reason why you think you should be picked and can make the orgy a fun and exciting experience for everyone involved. Be funny! Be excited and sexy! Do whatever you want. Pics aren't required as we're not pic collectors, but hey, if you're super hot and want to show off, we won't say no!  As much as I wish we could just let every Redditor in, I'm pretty sure it would be a 15:1 dick to chick ratio, and I am doing EVERYTHING in my power to avoid that. 

**Priority responses will be for single females and couples.**

As we keep things moving, select a venue and date etc, we may ask our accepted attendants to chip in or volunteer in order to help out with the costs/work of renting out a sex club or some other vagtastic venue. Check it out, we're crowdsourcing orgasms! The power of Reddit!

I'm hoping you are too.

""But, pray tell, why is this twenty-seven year old so awesome?"", I hear you shout down the tubes of the fibre optic cables spanning the length of countries worldwide. And I will answer.

I make people feel damn good about themselves. I put the effort in to make you realise that that one thing you've been missing out on all of these months and years is finally here and committed to staying around. And I do stress the word ""commitment"". One night stands of sex and nothing else is something which I grow bored of. I want more, so do you.

If however, you are looking for someone who is your equal in life and someone who takes great pride in knowing how to make you smile, then please, do continue reading.

Passion. What are you passionate about in life? What could you not live without? For me, it is my work. I'm a creator. A designer. I develop some incredible work for some incredible people and get to see the work being used in public. I've developed work for businesses, individuals and worked with charities. I love my job.

Desires. What do you want to do in life that you haven't already done? For me, it's more travelling. Japan. I would very much like to travel to the East and sample an entirely different culture. Also on my list are Australia and America. Adventures are what life is made of.

Fun. What makes you laugh? Is it a good night out in town with a few mates or perhaps a good meal in a good restaurant. I love both and I love to dance. I hope you do as well.

And so this is where I conclude. If you're looking for someone who knows what they want from life, with some strong passions, desires and the drive to enjoy life to its fullest, then I invite you to get in touch. In the meantime, enjoy the rest of your day and I hope that you're making the best of it.",,False,,t5_2rn0e,False,,AY,True,t3_j2cyu,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/j2cyu/the_most_awesome_twentyseven_year_old_man_you/,

Of course, I don't realise what an asshole they are until it's too late. That said, I do actually prefer nerdier guys, just don't have the confidence to approach them. 

I don't think a few tentative messages are going to start anything, so I'm going to stick my neck out there and go on a date anyone in the NYC area.

**Here's me:** I'll be turning 25 this week and would love to meet someone new that I could connect with! People often call me ""cute"" rather than ""gorgeous"" or ""beautiful"". It's something I've learned to embrace though with my unique personality. If we connect well, you can see what I look like in exchange for your picture.

**Here's what I'm into:** Of all the things I enjoy in life, I'd have to say that I have a strong love for movies, tv shows, music, and gaming. Sitting down and watching Top Gun for its 80's awesomeness is definitely an idea for a fun night although action, horror, or comedy movies are perfect for me. As for music, I'm a bit all over the place but primarily enjoy various types of rock or electronic music. I'll listen to nearly everything though as long as it's good! But if you're into tango music (Astor Piazzolla to be more specific), then you've piqued my interest a great deal already. Gaming is a massive part of my life so if you'd like to meet someone who loves it, then I'll be your cup of tea. TV shows like Arrested Development, How I Met Your Mother, Frasier, and Black Books are replayed often for me.

**Here's what I'd like to find:** A lasting friendship that could lead to something more over time would be perfect. If you love trading links of songs that you've been addicted to or clips of movies that you think are hilarious/awesome, then we'll get along just fine. Meeting someone who can have intelligent conversations but also have a witty and brilliant sense of humor would be great. If you'd like to keep in touch every day and talk about the little or big things in life, then you're amazing already. I'm done with dating and would like to find someone genuinely nice and stable for once.

**Here's what I'm not here for:** I'm not looking for FWBs so don't come to me looking for talks about sex. I'm confident in myself sexually but I'd like to talk about that in a more classy way in the *far* future if I get to know you well.

I am a 22 year old girl stationed here in our great land. I'm in college and have fallen victim to the monotony and hardship that comes along with it. From the dietary woes of eating ramen to the physical toll that class and work have taken, I need a friendly escape from my collegiate prison.

That's where you come in, fellow redditor. I assume you must also be looking for some type of companionship, as you've found yourself reading my post. No matter how hard you're rolling your eyes at the way I've formatted this, we all seek to feel wanted by someone.

How about you? What do you do? Are you a Bob from Ohio who is tethered to your family's small business and dying to get out? Are you an Adam from California who smokes weed at his low end telemarking job? (That is NOT a Workaholics reference and you can't prove it) Or are you maybe a Josh from NYC who works for a high-end company and barely makes eye contact with people on the subway?

I don't really care what your name is or where you are. I'm not looking to settle down with you. I'm just a little lost, as most of us are. I'd like to hear your story and if you want, tell you mine. Maybe we'll form a small connection that will be severed quickly. Or maybe it will be like a match and burn brightly but die just as soon. Or maybe it'll be a dull spark that will burn for a long time and only go out when we both die. (Lol, the cheesiness.. it kills)

In all seriousness, I don't want to exchange nude pictures with you. I don't want to reply to your half-hearted message that you send to every girl on r4r that just says ""hey whats up pm me if u wanna chat."" If that's the only effort you'd put forth into talking to me, I wouldn't be interested anyway. I just want you to remember our conversation.

For the sake of not turning this into a short, published novel, I'll end here.

I'm a 31 year old woman and I'd like to have a child. The problem is I'm in the process of getting a divorce and the prospect of going through the whole dating game with all its twists and turns is a bit daunting with my biological clock ticking away. So what I'm looking for is a bit unorthodox. Ideally I'm looking for a healthy man who is willing to have a child with me through ""natural insemination"" and would continue to be a part of the child's life. We do not need to have a relationship other than being on friendly terms, but I believe it's only fair to the child to know who their father is. To be clear, this would not be a ""donation"" arrangement, this would be a full and complete partnership. I know some people will judge me, but I'm beyond caring what other people think of me. 





Some vital stats should you wish to consider going further:



I'm 31



White



5'8""



Blond hair (natural) but I dye red. My brother is a redhead, it's in the genes.



Blue eyes



BBW body type, I am incredibly well proportioned and I love my body and am incredibly confident. (I know I'm not everyone's cup of tea though)



In very good health and am D&amp;D free



No family history of any major illnesses 









If you've read this far and would like to consider taking this path I'd love to hear from you. 


Edit: I'd like to add that this is the most honest and straight forward way to achieve the goal. I could do what thousands of other women do and lie about birth control to trap someone.

really is something special. I'm a 21yo guy who met this girl on reddit(r/foreveralonedating) on may 9th
and we started talking, and we talked a lot. I live in new york city
and she in Washington state, were about 3000 miles apart. We were
skyping for about 5 to 7 hours a day for almost every single day for two months. Shes
so perfect and beautiful, I began to get feelings for her stronger
than just being her best friend. I can talk about absolutely anything
with her, together we work through everything so easily and our ability
to talk and communicate is by far our best quality and what 
makes us strongest. So after I started getting feelings for her, of course
it was really scary, I didnt want to ruin what we had, she was 
already my best friend. So I tried to kinda ignore them and hope
that theyd go away but I soon realized that I was being silly.
I could have tried and convinced myself for weeks that she wasn't so perfect
for me and that she wasnt the sweetest girl Id ever met, but that would
just be me being in denial because she was all I thought of her and more.
Im 21 and shes almost 19, and neither of us have ever been a relationship
before we met, we both look at relationships as being something very
serious and only plan on being in one. We feel that a relationship
that starts should already at that point have certain 'vows' that
come with it, instead of just experimenting with people and their
emotions. I always thought that when the right girl for me would come 
along, it'll be clear that she is the only one Id be with. And with my 
princess nothing has ever been more clear than our destined long
future together. 

A little less than two months after we first started
talking, I felt the time was right and I told her how I felt, the 
biggest risk I ever took in my life. She was surprised and just 
confused at first, the night ended with us agreeing to talk about it
another time, she said she needed time to think. This was a friday 
and she was going away for the weekend, so that was the worst possible
time for us to not be able to talk for a couple days. She did a lot
of thinking during her weekend away, and when we finally talked
again on Monday (it felt like a month away on Friday night), she
said she also has feelings for me beyond that best friends have,
and was willing to give a long distance relationship a try. 

This was July 9th, and a couple days ago was our one month anniversary, and I 
could honestly say I love this girl more and more each day. She means
the world to me and everything with her is just so effortless. We knew
from the beginning that a long distance relationship would be hard, but 
we were convinced that theres nothing we wouldnt be able to work through. 
And we were right, its soo much harder than we ever could have thought, theres
nothing I dream of more than just being with her one night, but I know our time
will come and the wait would make it the best day ever, and we'll experience happiness
that day that most people would probably never come close to feeling. Theres 
no better feeling in the world than feeling loved for exactly who you
are, and we both have that feeling. We don't have to try and impress each other,
or try and do more than we were comfortable with, we really are just ourselves
with each other all the time. We dont have to worry about us being upset with 
each other or even us not being together at any point, because we already
promised to work through all the issues that will ever come up, and thats 
exactly what we've done so far. I know this might sound silly, but the same way
my sister will always be my sister no matter what our future holds, I know this girl
is as just permanent of a girlfriend to me. We even picked out our kids name one day
already. We already told pretty much all our family about each other, and I even
started talking to and getting to know her friends and sister.

The reason we wanted to share this with you guys is so you realize that love
is out there to find, never give up on it. I wish everyone can feel what we 
feel for each other because its truly amazing. Just keep at it, and don't ever
do yourself short. Theres someone out there that will make each of you feel
so happy and loved all the time, and anyone less than that isn't worth your time. 
I never would have thought that I would find a girl for me in the next five years at least,
but I'm blessed to have found her, so thank you reddit for changing my life forever,
and I cant wait to hear about all of you finding love so pure that it comes with 
zero doubts or second thoughts. Thanks for reading :)

In my dream, I left my home at almost the middle of the night and willingly stepped into the backseat of a four-door car. The vehicle was not a taxi, but I was being chauffeured through twists and turns of my city, ever traveling outward without any real orientation or recognition for the changing scenery outside the window. I rode along in the backseat for what seemed like almost an hour. The driver was a man, but there was no conversation, no eye contact. All I had was the foreknowledge that at the end of this car trip, this man was going to violate me sexually. I use the term ""violate"" very loosely - I obviously was complicit in the act since I willingly stepped into the car, but for the entire car ride, I wavered emotionally between being sexually aroused at the thought to horrified that I might not live to see the morning. After ages, we pulled up along side a rather nice house and he shut off the engine. We sat for a brief moment in that same silence. Then he opened the door, stepped out, and entered the house. I sat for some time in the backseat, contemplating whether I was going to unblinkingly walk into my own sexual assault, still torn between fear and arousal. Eventually, I exited the car and entered the house. Since so much time had elapsed, I realized that the man could be anywhere waiting for me. I crept through dimly lit rooms until I chanced across a small guest bathroom and stepped into it. That's when the door behind me shut, and I woke up.

Here is my OKCupid profile (most of it, anyway). I think it's a good representation of me. 

And here's a pic: http://i.imgur.com/ZodmB.jpg

**Self Summary:**

I have been told that I have a very quirky sense of humor, and I would have to agree. I'm pretty sarcastic and very random. My personality is definitely not run-of-the-mill. For an idea of my humor, search YouTube for: Don Hertzfeldt.

Let's see, most of the time I dress for comfort, but when I need to dress up, I do a pretty good job of it.

I really like to travel. I've been to NYC a few times, and to London once. I'd love to see California and some more of the East Coast.

Discovery Health or a medical drama is usually what you'll find me watching if cable is available. Nothing beats a great ""before and after"" or learning about some rare and disfiguring disease. Trust me, it sucks you in. I'm also obsessed with NIN and a big Family Guy and American Dad! fan.

FYI - I don't work out or play sports. I notice a lot of guys here want a girl that works out. That's not me. I like going on walks or hikes and sight-seeing, but running on a treadmill or biking up a mountain just isn't for me.


**What I'm doing with my life:**

I am in graduate school for a Master's degree in journalism. I'm also a teaching assistant for the journalism department.

My dream is to own property with a beautiful house for me and several cabins on it that I rent out.


**Favorites:**

I love to find really off-beat fiction and non-fiction. ""Kissing in Manhattan"" by David Schickler and ""First Person Plural"" by Dr. Cameron West are two of my favorites!

I really love watching good stand-up comedy. Robert Schimmel (RIP), Bill Burr, and Louis CK are awesome!
As far as TV goes, I watch Discovery Health when I can (as mentioned above), but the main shows I watch (on a regular basis) are: Modern Family, Raising Hope, Dexter, Louie, Grey's Anatomy, and Real Time with Bill Maher. Hulu is a good thing.

Rainy days are a favorite of mine. Whether I just make a cozy, indoor day of it or brave the weather and go outside, I think the rain just adds something.

When it comes to traveling, my favorite vacation spot is NYC. When I go, I always catch at least one show and try to see anything I didn't see last time. I even have a little tattoo honoring the city (I have five tattoos total).


**Looking for:**

Straight guys only

Ages 27-35

Near me

Who are single

For long-term dating


**Message me if:**

You are a non-smoker, with no kids, around 27-35 yrs old, and not religious.


**My stats:**

Ethnicity - White

Height - 5′ 3″ (1.60m).

Body Type - Thin

Smokes - No

Drinks - Rarely

Drugs - Never

Religion - Atheism and very serious about it

Education - Graduated from college/university

Job - Education / Academia

Children - Likes &amp; Wants children (eventually)

Pets - Likes dogs and has cats

Male, London, 20s, etc! I really really enjoy talking dirty to someone. I find it's amazingly engaging for me and it's amazingly good mental exercise. You have to think really quickly, you have no time to pause and it's about building a mental atmosphere and sort of directing people around in their own imaginations with what you say.

I'm really not segwaying into 'hey sup turn ur cam on', at all, or asking for the compliment to be re-payed. I love talking about it, and happily enjoy doing it just as a learning thing. The more I try it out, with different people, the better I get. I'm told I'm getting dangerously good.

This is really no strings; my time-zone might be most opportune for a lot of people but it's just light-fun, nothing heavy so please PM me your skype (that's pretty much the easiest way) and chat, if we seem cool then sure, lie back, close your eyes and I'll try my best.

Again, this is no subtle or clever ploy to lure girls onto skype, this isn't about getting action; I'm not after or desperate for that. Honestly, I just want to practise and talk to as many people about it as possible.

Oh, did I mention DAT ACCENT?

Anyway! Hopefully this wont sink into the bowls of hell and I'll get at least one taker. I'm really pessimistic that this seems an elaborate scheme, so try me.

Toodles!


**Edit:** Ok wow, I've gotten a hugely positive reply. Awesome! I've gotten loads of people now to talk to and give them 15 minutes of bliss; but by all means keep replying/PMing me, I'll promise I talk to everyone who PMs me a skype name if nothing else. This should be, and is, really laid back and relaxed too, so if you're unsure or hesitant, then we can chat for a few hours, days, about cool stuff and we can just try.

I'm really keen on getting people who find this scary too, or never thought about the idea. I'm open to you turning off your microphone, so literally all you hear is my voice and I can't do, see or hear anything of you.

I'm currently about two months into a road trip across the US. It involved hitchhiking for about 3 weeks, then getting into a car and roaming for a month.

That leaves me with about 4 months of useless wandering I can do to meet people and do awesome things (I love doing other people's favorite things) until I have other things that I need to do. I plan on hitching to wherever so I can't give you a exact time that I plan to arrive, but if you give me a time frame, I can try and work with it.

So, about me. I'm horrible with these things so I'd suggest you just look through my reddit profile. But if you don't want to go through that, here's a brief bit about me off the top of my head. I am going to school for Archaeology, and I took a semester off to adventure around because it's been my dream to do so. I'm currently sharing a cup of bottomless coffee while we play scrabble.

Rather obviously, we're looking at a throwaway account here. I'm just sort of wondering what kind of response I will get if I'm as honest as I can be - rather than the minimizing of faults most people use on dating profiles. 

Well, I'm 29 years old - American. I presently live overseas, and have for several years now. Not military, just working. I graduated with dual bachelors degrees in Chemistry and Criminal Justice - wanting to work in Forensics. I couldn't find anything in the field, and got a chance to work abroad. Now I teach kids - and I really like it. I'm considering trying to work toward teacher certification in the US when I return. 

I'm somewhere between 5'6"" and 5'7"", I weigh around 240 lbs. Yup, I'm overweight.  Got that. If that's not your thing, quietly go along your way, please. I'm learning to live with it. I have my moments of hating the way I look - but by and large, I am usually a really happy person. Blue eyes, hair that varies between brown and blonde shades - somewhat depending on how recently I've dyed it. I have lost track of my natural hair color - but it's somewhere between those two colors as well. 

I'm geeky enough to be on reddit, but I wouldn't be building my own computer. I have installed RAM before - but it was quite a while ago.  =P I have a reasonable clue about the workings of my computer, and I usually know when I'm over my head. I have never watched Star Wars, and I am okay with that. I finally watched Indiana Jones a few years ago, and admittedly I was hooked. :3 I also got into Doctor Who semi-recently, and I adore Tennant (though to be fair I have only watched 9th Doctor - present). I am in love with the BBC miniseries of Sherlock and would like season 3 immediately, please. 

I watch MLP:FiM, albeit irregularly. I'm finally caught up. The most recent episode made me cry. I also cry at things like Home Makeover: Extreme Edition and books, etc. I watched Glee for about a season and a half - but I do greatly enjoy most of the covers they have done. My copy of iBooks is rife with young adult fiction and Sherlock Holmes. The most recent book series I devoured was Percy Jackson. 

I am a huge fan of Japanese pop music from one group in particular. It's unlikely to be the first one you think of. I listen to other music, but usually if left to my own devices I revert back to listening to J-pop. 

I love Disney animated movies, and I love Disney in general. I'm not talking about papering my entire living environment in it, but I really enjoy going to the park if I can, and small accents in Disney are pretty darn cute. 

I'm a picky eater. Like, really. I have turned into a (non-rabid) Apple fan girl - partially because the stuff is so easy to use and share between. Computer, iPhone, iPad mini, iPod - I have it all. I won't spout off about how they're the OMGBESTEVER - they just happen to work well for me. 

I like making people happy, I like making people laugh - might be why I am so good with the kids I teach. I am, however, pretty shy in person - except at work. I don't go out much, I don't like crowds. Small gatherings are okay. 

I also think this has been seriously long. If you want to know more, toss me a message. I'll check it in a while. ",,False,,t5_2rn0e,False,,,True,t3_192kvo,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/192kvo/29_f4m_anywhere_as_honest_as_i_can_be/,

I'm coming up to Sydney before I start uni in Melbourne and so, on the 8th of February, I'm looking to have a lot of fun. A couple who I play with (frequent users of reddit for sexual pleasures) directed me here, so I thought I'd see who bites before I resort to craigslist.

Basically, I'm looking for a group of clean, DND free guys to come join me in a hotel. Once they're there, I want those guys to fuck me every way they can.

All I ask is that you cum on me, rather than in me - cumming in me is punishable by ridicule and shame. On my face, butt, tits - I don't care, as long as it's on me in the end.

Shape or size doesn't matter, as long as you're comfortable fucking in front of other guys. Even if you aren't, I'm sure you could learn quickly, right?

I'm looking for up to ten guys who're available on the 8th from 10.00. Here's a teaser of [what you'll get to fuck](http://imgur.com/M8g7wwc) if you pass the grade.

I know a lot of you will call fake, and that's okay. PM me for verification and more information. Please include a photo and a little bit about yourself. If you have it, a recent sex check would be great - you'll get mine and the chance to bang without condoms.

I'll have a couple of male and female friends nearby and in the room to facilitate everything and make sure it all stays safe and friendly.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Although that's my main focus, it's not the only thing about me. 

Now to the point. Almost every year while I was in KC, I used to go to the Nutcracker with my family as a tradition. It marks the beginning of the Christmas season. No. Thanksgiving doesn't count. But, my family is still in Kansas and I have no one to go to the ballet with me who are not already busy.

What I propose is a date. I'd like to dress up a bit and take someone out for a nice early dinner before the ballet. Unfortunately the ballet is at 7 pm and I would be famished if I didn't eat before. Low blood sugar. I blame my mother's genes. So a nice dinner downtown, maybe RA Sushi if you're into sushi (and since it's close to the theatre), or I am opened to suggestions and I'm paying. We enjoy the ballet and I walk you back to your car and wish you a good night. I'm from the midwest and pretty traditional  (not religiously). That being said, there is no expectation of funny business on the first date.

If you're an intelligent gal, who's driven, active, fun, and caring, with a great sense of humor, who's also interested in this date and potentially more, then, PM me with your age, a picture of yourself, and some of your interests. And I'll in turn send one back =). Whew, that's a lot of requirements but not even redditors should settle, right? 

Lets converse on PM or Skype and get to know each other a bit. Not too much, though, so we can have a fun getting to know each other in person.  

I think that covers everything. 

Cheers,

A friend asked me yesterday, *""What do you want in a girl; what are you looking for?""*.  It didn't occur to me until just then that I hadn't thought about it, not really. I mean, sure, every man in the world has thought about it in a minimalistic sense. *""Cute, smart, funny, brown hair-""* that sort of garbage. I have no idea what the right words to put here are, but I've read enough failed attempts to know what *not* to write.

I want. *""Want.""* Wanting is for the elite. I don't want. I need. I need someone that I can talk to when I can't sleep. I need someone who will turn their cell phone off to watch a new Doctor Who, and someone who will watch the stars with me at night because of how exhilleratingly human it feels. I need someone who realizes holding each other isn't something that needs to be asked for, someone I can write a love letter to for perhaps no other reason than I feel she deserves one. I need someone that knows being an adult is not a full-time occupation. I need someone who will give me that Pokemon battle I've trained so hard for- someone to will face Endermen and craft nations with me. I need someone that wants to fall madly in love, because belonging to each other is the only chance any of us has at a real, tangible happiness.

If you read this far, thanks~ As a man, I don't expect to get much attention, but it does feel good to at least pen this out. Cheers, mate &lt;3",,False,,t5_2rn0e,False,,AV,True,t3_14bl7u,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/14bl7u/19_m4f_looking_for_her/,

Trees help me with my social anxiety... By the way, I have social anxiety. I'm introverted by nature, so large crowds of strangers aren't my favorite.

Users would upload a short video of themselves (30-60s) and some key information about themselves (age, gender, sexuality, etc). For privacy concerns, there'd be no way to browse other users. Instead, everyday you'd receive a potential match and be asked if you'd like to meet them. If both you and your match agree to meet we'd open up communication channels like private messaging so you could get to know each other and set up a date.

Now, the biggest challenge a dating site faces is the chicken and the egg problem. That is, it needs users to be interesting but to get users it must be interesting. So if I made it, would you use it?

We talked, we joked, we laughed and there was a bit of chemistry there. 

We ended the night with a kiss, athough she still teases me to this day about the 3 day beard I was sporting at the time. Long story short it was the beginning of something special. After a few weeks, we decided to be bf/gf/

I have a genuine question. So, I'm an overweight girl and I'm a virgin. Surprise. I'm about a size 18 and I've had a few boyfriends but I've never felt comfortable enough with any of them to go ""all the way"".

I'm primarily popular for my persona and sense of humor. I've been told that I'm a really warm person and can talk to anyone. I also like to think I'm pretty and because I've been told and that if I lost weight, I'd be on the higher end of the ratings. Before I forget, I'm of a Pakistani/Indian heritage. If I didn't have an American accent, I'd pass for an authentic ""foreigner"". But the point is, I've been a big girl for as long as I can remember and you can tell me to lose weight all you want but that's not the focus of this post or my question.

My question is, honestly speaking, how many men out there would find a size 18 virgin, with (what I think is) a good sense of humor and over-average personality attractive?

I've been feeling quite lonely lately, so here I am.. hoping you're going to change that! Ultimately I'm looking for something that could turn into more than just friendship. No rush though, I'd just prefer if that was a possibility. I'm generally looking for someone around my age or older.

I have a fulltime job and live alone. My evenings and weekends are pretty much spent gaming, watching tv series (or both at the same time), and occasionally hanging out with friends.

I play some WoW (EU servers) but would love to try out new/old/different games as well! I also enjoy Minecraft with some good company, especially if I can farm all day and don't have to build something fancy :p I think playing games together can be a fun way to get to know eachother, so I guess I'm looking for a gamer of some kind who'd preferably also be open for voicechatting at some point.

The TV series I'm currently watching (or waiting for new episodes of..) are Dexter, Criminal Minds, Psych, White Collar, The Big Bang Theory, How I Met Your Mother and Doctor Who (2005). I like watching movies too, but preferably not alone.

I love music as well, no specific genres though, I just listen to whatever I'm in the mood for. I've played trombone for more than half of my life, but I took a break from playing a couple of years ago. Considering to pick it up again soon!

I like to party once in a while, but prefer ""homeparties"" over clubbing and bigger parties. I'm not a big fan of drugs or other illegalities (is that even a word?). I don't smoke either.

Personality-wise I'm a bit shy, but can be very social and outgoing once you get to know me and once I feel secure around the people I'm with!

Just as a heads up, as I know it's a dealbreaker for some: I'm on the heavier side (but slowly working on it), and I'm not the most feminine girl around; I've got long dark blonde-ish hair, but hate makeup, dresses and shoes.

I’m 5’1’’ and have been told on numerous occasions that I resemble Eponine from the new Les Mis movie if you squint your eyes. I’m definitely girly but also love a good shower beer after a long distance run or an all-day hike. I’m a big believer that life doesn’t need to be either/or. Pink is my favorite color and I wear makeup pretty much daily but I also adore comic books, Firefly and Futurama and am reigning trivial pursuit champion in my apartment. During the week I spend a lot of time on my studies or doing work in the anatomy lab. Weekends find me just about anywhere- on a long run, sleeping, house party, watching movies with my roomie, bar, bikeride, coffeeshop, hiking, volunteering, doodling, attempting to take over the world.



So why am I on r4r? I need a change in the status quo- I’ve got a few male friends but definitely more female friends. I’d enjoy having someone down-to-earth to bounce ideas off, chat about my day with, geek out with, get to know, answer puzzling questions about those with a y-chromosome and so on. I’m down to message/text/skype. 


I should probably mention that I’m not opposed to a friendship developing into something more but I had my heart pretty badly mangled last year and I’m a lot more pragmatic (as opposed to romantic) than I used to be. Take that as you will- I’m a lot more wary of relationships now so I figured I would be upfront about that.

Anyway, I’m also down to exchange pictures! Send me a pic of yourself and I’ll send one of me (for the love of god/science/whatever please no penis pictures- I know what a penis looks like and I’ll just ignore you).


One last thing- if people message me back, I won’t be replying until later tonight; I’ve got work to do in the lab most of today and will read through potential messages this evening, so don't be offended if I don't get back to you immediately! (I know, delayed gratification is the worst)

Our marriage was not perfect, but had honestly been going very well in its entirety.  Even after admitting to the affair she said I was the perfect husband and that she wanted me back.

First of all, I know I'm gonna get shit for my title. If you've come to give me shit, carry on. 

So. It's Saturday night and I'm laying in bed, reading a book and chilling with my cat. I'm home on break and just feeling really lonely. I'm disappointed in the quality of friends I have at school and my friends at home are rather fragmented at the moment (long story). So I'm looking for some friends/maybe something more, if things develop well. I live in Boston, but go to school in Burlington, VT and it would be great if you're located close to one of those, but not mandatory. 

Here's five facts about me:

1. I don't really party. Or drink/smoke. I don't find the appeal in it and it's expensive. I can enjoy a nice glass of wine but I have a hard time being friends with partiers. 

2. I am a firm believer that it is the little things that make life great. A few coats of nail polish, cuddles with my cat,  handwritten letters, and little surprises are some of my favorite things. I'm feeling a bit like I put in way more to all of the relationships in my life- I just want someone who'll go equal with me.

3. ACK I don't know what to say for this one. I'm super jumpy, any sudden noise startles me. I love buffalo chicken. I want three kids, and would like to have at least one of them before I'm 30. 

4. I'm studying journalism but I don't want to be a journalist. I would like to work in admissions for a college. But journalism is pretty cool, and there really isn't a major for what I want to do.  

5. I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter, Uglies/Pretties/Specials/Extras, Breaking Bad, HIMYM, Doctor Who, and Firefly. I love really terrible reality TV- like Sister Wives. The last TV show I watched was American Horror Story on Netflix. I'm currently reading Graceling by Kristen Cashore.

I moved out to the Bay Area last year from Austin, TX and made quite a few friends through work, but now as of this month nearly all have moved away.  Hence, I'm starting the friend hunt over again!

But I am up for chatting at first, then maybe going out for a beer or some chinese food.  Penpals are also welcome, of course!

I just went through a tough break up very recently, hence dating at the moment isn't really in the cards.  I would be happy to be friends.  :)  I'm also not interested in any FWB or NSA.

I'd like to start by saying that if you're an ""average"" redditor, then I'm probably not for you. I've never seen Breaking Bad, I've been hit in the balls but never ""in the feels"", and I can't come up with a funny meme to save my life. I'm not an Athiest, and I only ""cri eRRy TYmE"" when I watch Forrest Gump and he does the monologue at Jenny's grave.

Really though, I'm a tall, big guy who's been called a teddy bear and bodyguard more than anything else.  I love talking to people, I'm not a socially awkward kind of guy so I'm usually the one feeding the elephant in the room peanuts. It's not to say that I start controversy, it's just that I don't mind talking about things people are afraid to talk about. However, listening to people is way better because I learn more from them than I do from myself.  The most surreal feeling I've ever felt is going over 200mph in a car, and the thing that scares me the most is routine.  I've done a lot of things that most people haven't, and most people do things that I haven't. My ultimate goal is to put my creative ability to use to make enough money to live comfortably with enough time to enjoy the comfortability. To me, those that achieve this balance are the happiest people.
 

The moments that life is the best in:
* being on the beach at night with 
a full moon and a cool breeze
* getting under a warm blanket when it's cold and cuddling with someone you love
* laughing until you cry
* getting a great massage, like when you can't finish a sentence because your body feels so overloaded with pleasure.

I feel like since this is reddit I should put the disclaimers:
*I don't live at home or in a basement
*I'm not a forever aloner.
*I will actually talk at normal, witty, sarcastic speeds in face to face conversation.
*I'm not physically deformed!
*My username is a joke, I'm really not a douchebag mcasshole.

I will start off by telling you a bit about myself, and you can decide if you are interested.

I am 21 year old female from western Canada. I have four younger brothers, and I am decently close to all of them. Not that I ever say it, but I love them all very much. I like [longboarding](http://imgur.com/LG5HC), [reading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Perks_of_Being_a_Wallflower), and [reading]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fault_in_Our_Stars), also [listening](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DPNGGiZxVI), and [listening](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84i7zQ_ACnU), to [music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbN0nX61rIs), and [making things](http://imgur.com/a/oFLCv), and [making things](http://imgur.com/2W170), and [making](http://imgur.com/a/6bcnx) things. I [never](http://imgur.com/pn4St) wear matching socks, and I always have ANDY written on the bottom of my right foot. It is like [Toy Story](http://www.1999.co.jp/blog/img/20100709ts1.jpg).

Because I have posted before, and my being a girl, I have received many replies. I would like to provide you with how to best get a positive result from me. I am most likely to respond to longer messages. A ""Saw your post, sup?"", will not get you a reply. Tell me a bit about yourself. If you are so bold as to show your [face](http://imgur.com/a/cnncV), you always get a reply. I also like good sentence structure and formatting. To me, that shows intelligence. I do not mean to sound pretentious, or to push anyone away with this. I just want to be helpful. I promise I am quite easygoing. As well, if you put your name in the subject line, that will help me tremendously. I prefer to get to know people here as opposed to [skype](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_4lymMEN3vvc/SduzuIlI4vI/AAAAAAAAAGc/tyAR-LiuS3w/s320/no_skype-1.png)

I am still receiving many messages, so I will let you know what I look for in a message to get a reply. 

* I like a lot of links.

* Formatting is key. I like a large message, but huge walls are hard to get through.

* Showing your face will help me remember who I am talking to. 

* I like puns, but try and be original.

Just because I am getting a lot of messages, does not mean you should not send one. I love talking to people of all sorts.

When I'm not getting surgery, I enjoy traveling near or far, swimming, jogging, drinking, and marathoning TV series. I also attend college and have one more semester left before I earn TWO bachelors degrees, so I can feel twice as bad about being unemployed come December.

A bit about me:

I'm pretty tall at 6'3"", with an average-ish build. I live in Lansing, go to school, work part time, etc etc. Obviously single. I like to read a lot, mostly historical fiction, science fiction, dystopian stuff, and a bit of classical literature too.

I like to play computer games too. A bunch of different kinds. I don't know really what else to put in this thing, so ladies, feel free to ask questions, and if you add your picture I would appreciate it immensely. I get a bit nervous jumping out there blind.

I'm not really looking for anyone over like 25-27.

I'm not expecting anything beyond some mild flirtation and of course having fun! This should be a given for everyone but unfortunately it's not for many out there.

Please PM me your email with your first name, age, and if you'd like, a picture along with your message!

Possibly until we pass out. However, I live in the Atlantic time zone, so if your 4pm is my 2am: lets do this.

Talking about myself is surprisingly difficult, but here is my best shot:
 
I like art, science, the ocean (but not the things in it), high heels, lip gloss, and the sound of tennis balls bouncing. I'm ridiculously terrified of things with tentacles and give you full permission to mock me for it. I'm intense, driven, and constantly laughing.  I'm allergic to everything and I cook all the time, usually in heels while blaring bad 80s music. I've got a super useful fine arts degree (&amp; hence needed another career ...) and am finishing up a neuropsych degree this summer. I work as a political lobbyist, mostly for mental health care issues. I've got dark hair, greenish eyes, ridiculously pale skin and a deep rooted love of red lipstick. I do have pictures and I will totally send them because that somehow makes me feel less creepy. No, you wont see my tits (though they are pretty awesome, so I understand why this is disappointing).

I'm also a little messy and have some pretty shitty anxiety issues (PTSD), that make me not sleep, and that's where you come in! I dont really want to talk about my problems- I have a therapist for that (but feel free to talk about yours!)- I just want a 2am distraction that isn't starring at the ceiling and re-watching shitty tv.  Plus, I'm pretty awesome and I really like new people.

I'm pretty open and get along with almost everyone, but I prefer the ones who write in full sentences. I'm especially enthusiastic about those with a deep rooted love of bar night trivia, good books, loud music, strong drinks or ""The Newsroom"". 

Be my friend?

EDIT: this got way more attention than anticipated! you all sound lovely and i will actually respond, honest, i promise. unless you sent me dick pics and/or are a minor because both of those things make me feel slightly awkward. kudos to the exhibitionists that labeled their dick pics though, i appreciate the politeness.

I really should have thought about what I was going to write before I opened this because I am so bad at these things. 


Basically I'm watching everyone move on with their lives and it makes me feel oh so alone. I guess I just want to think that there's someone out there who gets me. I'm not really that complicated, I like music and sports (Hockey and Football mostly), I like art (classical and asian not so much contemporary), I've been described as random, crazy and in general all over the place. Currently I've been going through a vintage phase, playing old school games (Nintendo before the Wii catastrophe), reading old books, and mismatching my outfits. I spend a lot of my time reading and writing. 


Well, I could go on for hours; no one can fit themselves in a paragraph. I'm sarcastic and honest. Too nice for my own good. And pretty damaged so be warned. I should also classify my music taste: pretty much everything under the sun if it's good, but I lean towards the universe of punk and all the subcategories of it.

* I work graveyard at a hotel, so I can handle drunk people with ease.

* I also work daytime in a warehouse, so I can handle sober people with ease

* I love theater, I am currently in a musical, despite my lack of singing ability.

* I live in California, therefore I have blond hair and surf to school.

* I still have Backstreet Boys on my mp3 player.

* I'm not gay, despite the last couple of points, though if I was I would support my decision because I love me.

I came across a somewhat local Redditor through another member's post. He was in the comments, and we started messaging. We went to Due South Brewery in Boynton Beach, which is way closer to me. It was awesome! It was in the middle of the industrial section of the city, so it was very hard to find. Turns out, the brewery in an actual warehouse. We had a great time tasting the beers and eating goat cheese hot dogs...which must have been created by the gods. I'm pretty sure I'm not alone when I say that my mouth was jizzing from the awesomeness.  

I then decided to post an R4R, and someone recognized the running group I was referring to. So we decided to meet up at the starting point of one of our hashes (it's a running group, but we drink beer instead of water). Turns out he's an awesome runner...and drinker! I sprained my ankle that night, something like that usually happens when I meet new people. He enjoyed it so much, he returned the next week, even when I wasn't there because of my ankle.

Last night there were 4 of us, one of which was the first Redditor I met. This time, I traveled to Coral Springs to meet up. We went to a beer tasting, and holy balls, it was awesome! I feel that we hit it off great, the alcohol didn't hurt either. One of the Redditors even went and told one of the beer presenters that I have been gawking over his godly beard and got him to come over so that I can caress it. Creepy? Eh, I like beards, what can I say? A good beard, to me, is the equivalent of a nice rack on a woman.
By the end of the night, we were standing outside reminiscing of all the awesome laughs we had, and of course......the sharing of facebook accounts.
 
Anyways, just wanted to give thanks to all the awesome people I met last night! I hope we get to hang out again soon!
Also, thanks again to Reddit for having a community of awesome people and for making it possible to meet one another.

TL;DR: Met a few Redditors, it was awesome!

I'm looking for someone similar!",BurntFlower,26,5,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/xdngf/24_f4a_chicago_i_love_video_games_anime_books/,"Hi, I feel kind of self-conscious posting here for one very important reason. I had a **really** terrible experience when I met someone online four years ago, and have been wary since. Today, I decided to move on from that traumatizing event and try again. I decided to post a very specific profile of my interests in the hopes that there's someone out there like me to become friends with or more. So here are some things I like in no particular order.

**1.) Anime:** I've been watching since I was six years old and have been hooked since. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, but I love the deep story-lines, the flawed characters, and the fantastic settings that anime provides. 

**2.) Video games**: Oh boy. Just like anime, I've loved video games since I was a small girl (my mom did not appreciate her nine-year old daughter playing Golden Eye). Some of my favorites are Skyrim, Dragon Age: Origins, Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Mass Effect, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Zelda games, Pokemon games etc. I'm currently playing Portal. I also bought during the Steam sale Bioshock, Amnesia: The Dark Descent, LA Noire and Half Life.

**3.) Literature:** I'm a bibliophile. I love books to death. I think reading is a pleasure in life that I wish more people understood. 

**4.) Horror/Dark/Thriller movies and TV shows:** I do enjoy all sorts of movies (for the most part), but movies that I adore tend to be darker, and have serious plots. Some of my favorites are: The Godfather 2, Fight Club, Memento, The Silence of the Lambs, Pulp Fiction, and Pan's Labyrinth. I also hate romantic-comedies. As for TV shows, my all-time two favorites are Dexter and Breaking Bad. I also like comedy shows like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, South Park, and The Simpsons.

**5.) Heavy Metal:** Sadly, I don't know too many people who appreciate this. Too many friends and acquaintances just consider it noise. I beg to differ. I also like Thrash metal, Symphonic metal, Death metal, among others.

**6.) Drawing:** It's a hobby of mine. 

**7.) Martial Arts:** I'm always trying to improve, and I think I'm FAR from being *good* but I highly enjoy it. I'm a red belt in Taekwondo and I'm interested in learning Brazilian Jiujitsu and Krav Maga.

**8.) Science:** I just graduated with a degree in Biology and I hope I will become a doctor someday. I knew from an early age that I would study science since I always had my head in anatomy books.

**9.) Traveling:** I have lived in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia and the US. One of my biggest dreams is to travel all over the world.

**10.) Community Service/Activism:** Before you look at me funny, I will explain. In college, I was involved in Habitat for Humanity and Student Volunteer Club. I also volunteered at my local hospital. I genuinely do like to help people. I'm also very passionate about LBGT and women's rights.

And I think that about covers it! If you like some of the things listed here, you are not a sociopath, and are generally a cool person, I would be happy to talk to you, and perhaps meet up!

Maybe there's a pair of adventurous redditors who want to help me make it a reality this weekend?

I walk back into the living room.  I’ve only been gone for a moment—just long enough to refresh our drinks.  Mine and yours, and hers.  I don’t know what happened in that moment, but instead of lounging on the couch, you’re on all fours on the carpet. 

Your skirt is up over your ass.  Your panties are around your knees.  She’s sitting there next to you, facing me.  She spreads your knees just a little further apart.  “Isn’t this the prettiest twat?” she asks.  You can’t see her face, but her expression, to me, is devilish.  “Don’t you want to fuck this tight hole?”

You can’t see my reaction, but you hear the clink of glasses being set down.

“Hm.  Maybe.  Convince me.”

“Just look at this ass.”  You feel her soft hands swirl over your exposed behind.  “This is the ass of a real slut.  Look how smooth and soft it is.” She slaps.  You wince.  “And look what a patient fuckhole she is.”  She slaps again.  And again and again.  Your face must be displaying the surprise of being spanked so hard, but I can’t see it.  You’re being quite patient.

Probably because you know that it’s only a matter of time before she’s kneeling in front of you, licking your pussy while I fuck her.  Then it will be your turn to tease her for being such an eager little slut.

We can do this whenever you'd like.  PM me or email me directly -- my gmail username is the same as my reddit username.  Don't feel like you have to answer as a group.

Bottom line, ladies, is this: I want a companion. Someone to take proverbial (or even real) adventures with- someone I can laugh with, cry with, and be downright shit scared with. I am without this companion ship due to lack of options- after being with the same person for a number of years, you tend to alienate yourself, and getting back out there isn't much of a doable thing with a job like mine .

I'm a decent looking guy of the nerdy persuasion. (Obviously) I love Doctor Who, as well as a handful of other fandoms. I also love the outdoors, and pondering the makings of our universe. I'm not overly picky, but I do have certain things about a girl that I like- can't be blamed for that. I'm a professional go-to guy, which means I can do just about anything that pays well enough (and is legal).

Right now, I'm just looking for companionship. Near, far, wherever- if it works, it will work and distance won't matter. Especially when there's a big, blue box involved!

You: Should be clean, and take pride in your appearance to an extent. Be nerdy yourself, or at the very least, accepting of my quirky awesomeness. Should be understanding, healthy, and willing to try new things- especially if you plan on going on adventures. You should also be open or at least accepting to the fact that I am of the pagan persuasion- if you don't know, ask. I love talking about it and explaining. I'm open to anyone of any religious background. Also, no neo-conservatives. Sorry ladies, I'm a far left liberal, I can't stand the Glen Beck/Conspiracy Obama chatter. Gingers are a plus. If you know who Huma Kavula is, doubly so. Not picky of location, either- I'll go anywhere in the world if it is worth it.

So send me a message if you're interested. I'd love to talk, get to know you, and hey- who knows where things will go.

I am open to finding someone with whom I could be ~*more than friends*~ but let us not be too presumptive! 

I am finishing up my college degree; I study ancient History, how to use semicolons, and the royal we. Heavy political debate overwhelms me. I am not big on labels so these are kind of difficult for me: I don't exist in a list of my favorite bands. I just try to be nice (although I can be very grumpy.) I am into new-agey things. 

Also, I don't like bacon or Doctor Who so if you are one of those people who freaks out upon hearing that people have different tastes and interests, it is probably for the best that you do not respond.

I've tried my luck at R4R a few times before and got to meet some neat folks so here's another try!

A little about me? 

* I always end up making lists when I talk about myself
* I don't really like making lists
* I also don't like multiple sentences that start with ""I""
* I will try something new

Five adjectives that have been used to describe me by friends: Adorkable (I love that one), kind, funny, smart, smart-ass (and proud of it!), 

Five interests of mine: Reading, learning, writing, playing the guitar, spending quality time with friends

Five random facts about myself that currently come to mind: 

* I am a very chatty introvert (I love to talk to people, but it tires me out sometimes)
* I have never broken a bone or sprained a joint badly enough to require splinting (though I think a few times I *would've* gotten a splint if I'd seen a Doctor instead of my coach at the time)
* I sing in the car all the time when I'm alone (and with certain friends!), I am afraid of spiders (it is not a conscious thing, if I see a spider I get *really* wigged out)
* ... and last, but certainly not least, I wish I'd chosen to share **three** of each of these 'cos coming up with five is hard.

So, if I said anything to catch your eye, or if you want to talk to a medical student, or if you are just feeling caritative... drop me a line!

Cheers :)

I am not really looking for anything. I am just tired of having to be the 'mother' of my group of friends. 

Not that I dislike hearing about their relationship problems and work struggles, but I'd like to have someone to talk to about other things ... pretty much anything else.

My friends are not nearly as nerdy as I am, I would really love to have a conversation with someone who doesn't look at me like I am insane when I geek out, which is often.

About me:

* I am from a small town in Texas.
* I'm a gamer, PS3, I haven't really found anyone to play against in a long time so if you're into that, it's a plus.
* I read a lot, mostly Sci-Fi and fantasy, but also a lot of the classics and historical biographies.
* I'm nerdy and sarcastic.
* Apparently I have the kind of face that makes people want to tell me their life story, or have in depth discussions with me, usually when I am in the restroom or in line for the restroom. I have no idea why. 
* I watch a lot of Netflix, probably more than is advisable, I have some serious love for the BBC. 
* My favorite shows include but are not limited to: Black Books, The IT crowd, Sherlock, Doctor Who, Bones, Lie to Me, American Horror Story, How I Met Your Mother and The Big Bang Theory.
* I have all the proper appendages in the correct number and location. 
* I do graphic design and publication design.

Gird your loins and grab the drool buckets in preparation for the awesomeness I am about to unleash on you! The proverbial sex bomb is here, and he is looking for you!

To be fair, I am a friend of this guy, actually, and I'm writing this for him. I owe him a favour, and I'm repaying it.... without him knowing it. At best? He finds the lady of his dreams. At worst? She's a trap; either way, hilarity ensues.

This sexy stud-muffin is a one of a kind kinda guy; certainly not your average head case or average redditor (yes ladies, he is a redditor). What does he do during the day (when he is not saving orphans and puppies from burning buildings and helping little old ladies cross the road)? He is a Uni student doing his Honours in Organic Chemistry. What does that mean for you? That means that when the zombie apocalypse comes, this sexy mofo will be able to make you painkillers, perfume, and anti-zombie pheromones. A bit of magic in his lab (which will leave your breathless, nonetheless), a wink and a sarcastic quip, and this veritable vestibule of manliest manliness will have your hearts desire in his flask, ready to dose you up, down, and anywhere else you want a good dosing *waggles eyebrows*.

Too good to be true? I know. I too feel the same. If it weren't for the fact we share the same sexual organs (well, similar; we aren't conjoined twins) I would have him all to myself.

So, what else do you need to know about this stud? How is he going to provide for you? Bitch please, he has this sorted. This sex sculptor started his employment career at the low of the low, the scum of the universe; McDonald's. Whilst that doesn't resonate with the awesomeness you've come to expect of this awe-gasmic specimen, I've come to believe this; how can any person justify such talent that, if it weren't for his sublime physique, we could be excused for thinking he was the Second Coming of Raptor-Jesus. 

No longer does this apex of alpha masculinity work for such a whorish corporation; after taking some time to invent quantum-physics, he joined the Army Reserves WHILST doing Year 12 and turned out to be exceptionally good at both. What next? Why, only a university course with a tertiary entrance score of 95 could hope to challenge this polymath, and challenge him it did; but in unforeseen ways.

After trying to subjugate this paradigm of penile plentessitude as most courses do (sleepless nights, abhorrent conditions and the never ending white-noise of lecture talk), this fiendish course decided to do something new. In his pursuit of knowing everything, my friend was offered this choice; a sacrifice for knowledge of himself. What was this sacrifice? Half the light of the world to save the world; one of his eyes. Any lesser man, yea, any other MORTAL would have shied away from this chance to delve into his inner character in fear, but when asked ""Now you know the cost, can you continue on? Is it really worth the price?"" he simply replied with ""I pay it gladly"" and surrendered his eye to the vicissitudes of fate. But the price was much more than that; he lost his job, his girlfriend left him and, perhaps worst of all, lost his faith in his path.

It was a dark time for us all; it was if a light had gone out in the heavens, and all mortal men would have felt as the fabric of reality shivered under the colossal strain of such anguish. A normal person would have crumbled under the strain. A NORMAL person would have laid down, wailed at the sky and consoled themselves with some bullshit about ""luck"" or ""God"". Not THIS man. THIS man sat down, looked deep within himself and trawled the worth of his soul. Muttering quietly to himself, he searched for the meaning within himself for what seemed like 9 days and nights; impaling himself with his reason and watering the tree of knowledge with his life's blood and anguish. 

After this time, he raised his head and his missing eye glowed with the knowledge of the dead. Armed with this twin sight (for one of his gorgeous eyes, lost to the void, gazed from deep within the void whilst his other window to his soul beheld the wonders of this world), my friend said ""I will find a path, or make one"" and proceeded to do so.

Unbeknownst to him, during his sabbatical, a professor of philosophy had heard his muttering and even though he could only understand a few words in every sentence, the feeling of what was being said transcended language and struck him to the core. As a result, my friend was gifted with a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy; such was his depth of understanding.

Not content with one degree, my friend decided to leave bear blasting and diamond eating to lesser humans, completing another degree and deciding that ""Dr."" sounded badass in front of his name; thus he resolved to do his postgrad and PhD. for the only reason that makes sense - so that he could sign all his correspondence with ""Doctor"". 

So, that brings us up to now. With his knew found knowledge, and military skills, he teaches children in his spare time as a tutor and a instructor in a youth organisation.

What does he like? Such intellect can appreciate a wide range of things, and there are few things my friend actively dislikes. He listens to metal, classical, industrial and many things in between; as long as their is complexity and beauty beyond the ""normal"" he can at least appreciate it. 

Food? Yes. He is a vegetarian, but that is because a secret division of the government has told him that he has a genetic variation which means if he eats too much iron, he will turn into Iron Man. And you thought those movies were based on a comic! Hahaha. While my friend would normally laugh in the face of such adversity, before proceeding to tear it off, they threatened to kill every kitten they could find if he refused not to eat meat. 

Why would this stop him? I don't know. 

Surely, as we must agree, could he not simultaneously save ALL the kittens in the world, whist tearing ALL the faces off these assholes? He assures me that he couldn't (more humility!) so, rather than risk the life of one little cute kitty cat, he has staunchly decided to renounce meat forever more.

What more could you want to know? He has a car, a motorbike, enjoys reddit, hiking, powered hang-gliding and does martial arts. Why does he do martial arts? He says it is so that he can protect the people he loves, but I think it is because he is lazy. Lazy? That doesn't make any sense, I hear you say! However, to that I say this; such a mind-boggling polymath, such a PILLAR of destruction could easily make nuclear war look like a cake-walk, however, it would take too much effort and he'd rather invent molecules that look like puppies than waste such effort. Thus, learning martial arts means that he can exercise such destruction whilst ALSO making drugs for puppies which makes them even MORE cute. Why would he want to exercise such destruction? In case these altered puppies exceed the Myten-Floyder threshhold and send the entirety of the world insane from cuteness. Then he'd have to destroy everything to save the world. Half the light, indeed.

What does he look like? Well, I cant describe him too accurately, otherwise he'll be mobbed and he'd have to hire Chuck Norris to reply to his fan mail. He's of average height, with dark brown hair and Caucasian. He's fit, although not ripped; personally, I think this is because he has genetically engineering himself to be that way so as not to make all other men inferior in comparison.

How come this man is single? I ask myself the same thing before I sleep a night; it seems a crime against nature. Firstly, he tries to find the happiness and the zest for life within himself; he isn't going to just start dating someone because he is lonely. There needs to be magic, a spark; a connection. Unfortunately, because he is so unique, like all rare and precious things, finding anyone else with a similar lustre is a hard thing indeed.

Now, I know all you lovely ladies are frothing at the gash for a chance to meet the love child of Odin, George Clooney, and the entire Russian Spetsnaz, however I'd best give you all a heads up as to his tastes in women to increase your chances, and so the paradox of his sweet soft voice and razor sharp humour doesn't send you insane with desire at the first syllable.

He likes natural redheads. As in, he adores them. I've never really understood, but then again, who can comprehend the mind of the divine? I know he likes girls who are his height, or shorter (say shorter than 175 cm) who can hold an intelligent conversation and has an interest on a wide range of topics. He is well read, with a voracious interest in the novel and random, so any ladies like that will do well there. He likes to explore the crass as well as the classy, the dark as well as the light, so anyone easily offended need not apply. Sex? Definitely. However, be careful; this man will please you in every which way, and you won't be able to share your bed with another man without the thought of this cunning linguist crossing your mind. Ladies who are insecure and need someone to constantly pander to their drama are not for this man; why would he need drama when he could just read Greek literature? He sees the good in people regardless of how deep it is buried, and loves them for it. He doesn't care for the shallow drama of ""news"" or ""celebrities"" and would rather chew broken glass than watch ""mindless TV"".

What more is left to be said? He is single, he is sexy and he is singularly the most entertaining son-of-a-bitch on the face of this world. He loves to laugh, and shares himself unreservedly with all those he loves. The poor bastard doesn't know I'm doing this (hence throwaway) and I owed him, so here it is.

I have to trouble of finding a girl I like a lot, but she has a ex boyfriend thing or does not want to be in a relationship, and it hurts more then most women think. This happened to be resonantly and I have started to lose hope in finding a girl. 

I have come to Reddit to hope to find this girl I am looking for and to fill this whole. 

I am a nice guy, I am kinda nerdy but not at the same time. I am active military (air force). I do live in Alaska but as military goes I have no idea where I will be next. I am the kinda guy that does like to spend a lot of time with my girl friend and I would hope you would to, but I do agree on letting each other have a social life outside our relationship, like you go out with your friend I do the same kinda thing. I like to talk more then most, but I think talking is a good thing in a relationship. 

So what i am looking for in a woman. I am looking for some one that will like me for who I am and not try to chance me (maybe a little). That will support me in all of the things I do (yes you can talk me out of things) and that I do find attractive. Someone that is whilen to either one deal with a long distance relationship or 2 be OK with the fact I might get deployed and/or not be able to see each other for awhile besides Skype and other things. 

One last thing, I don't mind a long distance relationship, but if something comes out of us, I do expect you to be loyal and respectful of me and our relationship, as I will do the same for you.

I spit up coffee regularly at the stuff you all say, so today I said to myself: ""Self, wouldn't it be nice to have one of my own sweet, smarty-pants all the time?""

Now that I've complimented the hells out of all of you, here's what I am all about. 
I'm 5'4'', have burgundy hair and green eyes. I speak Spanish and English, cook like a genie, and like dressing like a hipster/gamer combo.

I'm working on my master's degree, and I'll be done in May. I work as a Language Arts teacher, so I read a lot. I used to be a news writer, so I'm addicted to NPR and the rest of the internet. I used to write for an ""alternative fun"" company, and I also used to write weird news for a wire service. With that said, I've got an opinion and thought on nearly EVERYTHING. 

I love comic books, action films and really stupid TV shows. I have been to the Con every year for the past 5 years, and even dressed up like an Orc from WoW (you'll have to bribe me heavily to see proof). 

I live in North County, and commute to the Irvine area for school a few days of the week, but I have three day weekends. It's a crazy schedule, but it works for me. I tend to spend free time in the middle of nowhere, like Wyoming, visiting nature and such. I want to go paddleboarding again, very soon. Want to come along?

I'm not picky when it comes to dudes. Be funny, be smart, and know when to bring on the charm. I've dated dudes of all shapes, colors and sizes (my favorite shape was a rhombus, but he was too slanted for my liking), so don't be afraid to at least say hi to me.

If we can share a good drink (be it an adult beverage or otherwise) and you promise to carry half of the conversation, I can guarantee I'll do my part as well. Ideally, we'll have enough similar interests (or at least one really good one) that we can do the stuff we like to do without spending time doing stuff we hate. Or, we'll both find each other's interests so enjoyable, that we'll gladly spend time trying something new, loving it, and subsequently broaden our respective lists of things we like to do.

I read. I write. I watch TV (Parks and Rec, American Horror Story, Dexter, HIMYM, Community, Nip/Tuck, etc.). I go out from time to time. I prefer bars over clubs. I find water soothing.

I created this account solely for this purpose, but it's not necessarily a throwaway, and I do intend to use it. I don't have a favorite color. I'm definitely right-brain dominate.

* I like to volunteer my time when I get the chance. I work a few days a week at the county animal shelter and I also tutor elementary school age kids in math.
* I’m fairly creative and I enjoy sewing and making jewelry, but I don’t spend as much time doing it as I’d like.

I don't have a life. I don't do anything fun after work, I don't do anything fun during the weekends - I don't do anything fun ever.

While coming back home, I think of dying. While going to work, I think of girls.

Eat, sleep, eat and sleep.

I'm not physically attractive and I'm most definitely not intelligent. Perhaps you'll be interested enough by the novelty of talking to a human being in their last hours?

**EDIT**: So no, it turns out that just as usual, I pansied out on committing suicide. However:

I think I'm going to create a single template answer for why /r/suicidewatch sucks and use it for all the self-righteous people who think that *that* subreddit is the way to go. So here goes:

1) I've already been on there, multiple times, I've been on /r/depression even *more* often.

2) Everyone there is good natured, but they recognize there's not *much* they can say. The best advice they can give is - go get real help, and they're right. I'm not there for real help though, I just want attention and friends.

3) There's a bunch of good natured and similarly depressed people on there who'll tell you something along the lines of 'Hey man, I'm in the same boat as you for X years, and things haven't changed...I've come to accept the universe is a fucked up place that hates me...'. I cannot stand that shit.

There are basically two reasons why I find it really difficult to commit suicide:

1) I don't know if it *won't* be physically painful - I don't like physical pain.

2) When I do get some courage to get over point 1, and I'm almost there, about to do it, I get *very* afraid there still might be hope, and I realize I might not be ready to flush it all away.

Just because I find it difficult to actually fucking commit suicide does not mean I feel empty or even suicidal. It's only a matter of time until point 2 won't be of any help.

However, for thinking even slightly that I'm a troll...**eat shit and die**. Here's a case in life where you should NEVER doubt whether the person posting is a troll or not, because let's say there are a MILLION trolls who do this...if you assume that the next person posting is a troll too and don't stop to say something, then the TROLLS FUCKING WON. However, if you just give everyone the benefit of doubt and do your best, then out of those MILLION trolls you'll help out that *one* person who was serious.

And the world would be a better place then.

It's a beautiful, sunny day in Oregon (which is pretty rare if you're not familiar with Oregon weather). I'm tired of studying and I'm tired of being inside. Yes, I'm overwhelmed with schoolwork and I should be studying for my midterms next week, but man do I need a break!

A little bit about me I guess: I'm double majoring at OSU in Corvallis, OR. (Go Beavers). I'm quite tall, shy, nerdy, introverted, blah blah blah. I do play the occasional video game (I used to play a lot, but cut back, because of school). I like watching Netflix, I love to bake, hike, raft (white water raft), camp, float the river, etc. I think that's enough for now...

Currently: I'm working on writing a research paper for my Food Systems Chemistry class. They let us choose a food that we enjoy eating, or that we're just interested in learning about. I chose kefir as my food subject. Mmmmmmm. Kefir is delicious, and it is sooo good for you! There is also a lot of cool science that goes into making really good kefir. If this is something that interests you, I may be able to tell you a little more about it (probably not much more), but it's really interesting, and I'm excited to learn more about kefir as a food system. :) Also...in the spirit of learning more about kefir, I went to the store yesterday and bought two quarts of kefir all for myself! (I'll share of course!) FOR SCIENCE!!!

Yeah, So now you know I'm a total dork, who nerds out about food science...Hopefully that doesn't scare you away. :P And sooo...If that didn't scare you away, and you live in Corvallis, come help me procrastinate! haha :) Thanks for reading my somewhat lengthy post.

Reddit is a lot more understanding, so I'm putting myself out here to try and find some people to talk to.

I'm a hardcore gamer, mostly playing Minecraft and LoL at the moment.  Tech has always been a passion of mine, as well. I got my first comp when I was 10, took it apart for fun at 11, and started messing with BASIC around 12, modifying Gorillas so my brother couldn't win (to this day, he hasn't figured it out).

I sit in a cubicle and type away, but what I really want to do is draw and paint in my home. I'm working on a promising startup on my off time that will probably allow me to quit my day job within the year.


When I've got time to myself, I'm always drawing people, talking to people, or scheming of some way to do one or both of the two.
I'm good at talking to people because 


I'm sensitive and listen a lot. Even though this ad may have a serious tone, I don't take myself too seriously, and I have a pretty weird sense of humor. It's probably a lot like yours if you're on reddit.


I'm a left-brain thinker. I create things all of the time. Thoughts, ideas, questions, drawings, stories, scenarios.


I'm very independent, and as much as I love being around people, I often need time to recharge, and I can't stay in entertainment mode at all times.


My past few relationships have sort of been thin and not as fulfilling as I wanted- that's probably my fault, because like most men in their 20s, I love sex and am a bit scared of commitment. And like most confident, charming men in their 20s, I don't have trouble meeting or attracting women. This has made it a bit difficult for me to realize when I have something good and substantial that I need to hang onto.


**What I'm looking for**: I'd like to meet a woman who's willing to take things slow and get to know me before we jump into anything. I'm going to do the same for you. I would love it if you enjoyed art, talking about philosophical stuff, and anything creative.

**My ideal day would probably involve at least two of following:**
*A movie at one of those theaters that play indie flicks.
*A good meal at a quiet place that isn't so fancy that we can't laugh loudly
*A walk through a nice museum
*Me drawing a portrait of you, and then drawing another one of you in a different pose.
*A long discussion about whatever's on your mind after we've had good sex.

Those can be in any order you like! I would love to meet a woman who is successful, has her own hobbies and friends, and is okay with me being the same way.

I'd love to meet a woman who inspires me.

**Me:** [I am a short(5 feet exactly) ginger(though dyed currently) gal with green/blue eyes](http://i.imgur.com/vxokJ.jpg). I am a gamer, enjoying things like Skyrim, classic Mario games, Sims, and first person shooters. I like having lazy days, but not too often. My life is hectic for the most part, though I do have time for new friends, and possibly even something *more*. 

I have many hobbies, some including art(as in drawing, photo manipulation, etc), singing, creating music, watching movies, hiking, exploring, spontaneous moments, and love.

I am honest, kind, loyal, blunt, stubborn and shy. I have my perks as well as my downfalls, and while we talk you will notice this. I am a hopeless romantic, looking for ~~the perfect Prince Charmi--~~ just a random guy who can deal with and understand and love a broken girl. I try my hardest to please other people, and while I have a backbone to stand for myself, I always put others before me in any situation. 

**You:** You're a guy or ftm who is between the ages of 18-22, and looking for a girl to call his own. You're kind, understandable and patient, though you know how to give me the shove I need in stressful situations. You love being cared for, looked after, cooked for. You're looking for an old-fashioned, ""old soul"" girl. You're taller than me ~~so you can reach those hard-to-reach cups on the top shelf in the kitchen~~. You like games. You're open minded. You can spell. You're loyal. You just want a girl to love who will love to back unconditionally. I don't care what you look like, as long as you are moderately average looking. 

I'm just sick of douche bags, and I don't even know if this will work. But I figured why not. If you want a girl who acts 10 years older than her actual age, here I am. I'm not a cheater, liar, abuser. I'm genuine, I swear. I'll let you know where abouts I am in Alberta once we start talking. 

I look forward to a red-orange envelope, stranger. &lt;3

So about me. I'm 19, a preschool teacher and I love cats(shocker). I have been to a lot of countries, and I have seen a lot of things. I am looking for someone I can relate too. Someone that knows what is going on in the world.
Also, I'm not a lesbian. I am more than willing to talking to women, but it will not go past talking.
And if you're a male please don't send an erotic novel type message. But I do enjoy talking to the opposite gender.

Doesn't stop me from thinking about him/us all the time though. I would appreciate anyone willing to carry on an ongoing conversation to distract me from going crazy over my current situation, and maybe have something to look forward to throughout the day.

 I enjoy Internet humor, pop punk that was only mildly relevant 5 years ago (I think my username reflects both those facts), concerts, Breaking Bad (please try to outnerd me on this show), random facts, psychology, horror movies that no person with any sense of taste should ever watch, and music in general. I am attached to my phone and only mildly ashamed of it. I used to be a huge pot head but quit this year. 

Anyone interested in casual penpal-ship (does not mean our conversations have to only consist of casual topics, however) feel free to message me. If we end up being around the same area and don't hate each other enough to be opposed to eventually hanging out, I'm open to the idea, but like I said earlier, i am going through a difficult transition over an important relationship so no expectations please. If I don't respond soon-ish I probably saw something shiny and will get back to you later. 

Also, if you just feel like taking advantage of each others anonymity on here, I'm always up for frank and honest discussions about one of my favorite topics: sex. We can give each other insight and advice about each others gender and bitch and moan about how fucked up people are to each other. Don't expect a cybering session though, I charge $10 a euphemism for that shit.

If you live close enough, and we get along great, I'd even be up for getting together sometimes, possibly turn this into something more? I'm kinky, have a dirty mind that I can't fulfill, and love being turned on by dirty talk. I think I'm pretty fun to talk to, pretty cute and worth getting to know.

Hit me up if you're interested!

Been a redditor for a bit now, came across this subreddit and figured why not give it a go. A little about me, I'm 25, living just outside Toronto, Canada. As you can tell by the title, I enjoy video games and will be studying Game Design this fall. Other than video games, I'm fond of Paintball, Soccer(TFC ftw :D) and Aviation, I hope to one day have my pilots license as I've had a fascination with aviation both cilivian and military since I was very young. Going hand in hand with the aviation passion comes Military History, don't look at this wrong, I'm not a WarJunkie, I just find interest in reading about old battles and conflicts and tactics that was used even as far back as the days of the Roman Empire.

I have no problem pm'ing Pics, but a short version(no pun intended) of myself would be about 5'4, and slim, I'm a mix from both my Parents, so you could say I'm one of those ""perma-tanned"" folk. I tend to see myself as pretty laid back and a joker, I can be silly and hyper as well as chill if and when the time is right. Also, I should mention it would be good if you were Ent friendly :). 

As for what I'm looking for, connections would be the bottom line. Physical appearance can vary, my tastes are pretty broad and I prefer to get to know someone rather just than just judge them on their looks, I understand relationships don't pop out of the ground willy nilly, and friendships can go places, so we could start there :). 

I hope I'm not forgetting anything, which I probably am. Hopefully I can clear anything up in PM's if any questions arise. ",,False,,t5_2rn0e,False,,,True,t3_qh3hw,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/qh3hw/m4f_polishes_his_amulet_of_mara_lets_see_if_this/,

Looking for someone who understands and to talk to.,,23,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/qe8rd/21f4r_anyone_else_have_rheumatoid_arthritis/,"**About me- ** Hello hello! This is not a post looking for pity or someone to take care of me, promise! 3 weeks ago I was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis, right now I'm just trying to make the best of a shitty situation. I'm 21, female from a small town in Northern California. I currently work as a graphic designer for an Ad company. School is on hold for the moment, I had to drop this semester because of lost days but I hope to become either a Wildlife Biologist, Animal behavior specialist or teacher. Both are working with smelly animals right? :P jkjk!

**More about me- ** I have a goofy sense of humor that is much like Arrested Development. I love video games (PC) like Dragon Age, Mass Effect (2, excited for 3!) Bioshock (2), League of Leagands, Hero’s of Newerth, Rift, Used to WoW (For the Horde!) Minecraft, COD Blops.

Since I'm having a hard time moving around atm, I've been crafting a lot! Sewing, making earrings, doing some photoshop stuff, I love art in a big way. I have an eclectic taste in music, 50's, 80's, big band, Jpop (I know I know..) Old school country, Classic rock, techno, opera. I love nature and being outside. I like Firefly (Serenity), the IT Crowd, Peep show, basically British TV. Oh! Garth Marenghi's Darkplace (email me instantly if you've seen that show!) and ghosts. I also love old movies, 30's-80's. Alfred Hitchcock and such.I guess I should leave some things to talk about :) But I hope that's at least a mini idea. Haha I feel this is sort of a mess I apologize I'm trying to make it the least awkward as possible!

So far my support system has been just my family. I feel like a lot of my friends use me to feel better about themselves as I am mostly sought out to sort out their relationship problems or self esteem issues. When it comes time for someone to listen to me, no one seems to be there. I am more than happy to help build someone up and work with them to fix issues in their life but I need someone to do the same for me. 

**What I'm looking for- ** I'm looking for someone who has RA and can relate to me. I would like to be able to talk to someone who understands what I'm dealing with and can offer at least an ear to vent to or a shoulder to cry on and tell me I'll be ok. I'm looking for a positive attitude and friend. I don't need someone to carry me through life, as that would be easier :P My hope is that we can lean on each other and build a stable support system outside of family. Also I've found out that since the general public doesn't know too much about RA, talking to someone who doesn't have it is often met with a blank stare and an, “Ok...” feeling. It's so frustrating! But if you're someone who thinks we'd get along I'd be stoked to hear from you too. :)

Thanks for reading!

P.S. I'm not looking for sexy time right now since I can't move my body very well. Unless you're into that...jokes, jokes. So no dick pics please, I'm sure it's awesome but give a girl a break. Thank you.

So some questions you might have:

1)  What the hell is an [IRC](http://bit.ly/z5yvbK)?

It's essentially a text based chatroom for real time communicating.

2)  Interesting.  How do I access this IRC thingy?

You first need to download a client to connect to the network.  Much like MSN, Yahoo, ICQ, AIM, gTalk.  You need something that can communicate with the IRC servers and make all that technical nonsense into something your eye sacs can comprehend.  For windows based users, [mIRC](www.mirc.com) is the most popular.  For OSX users [limechat](http://limechat.net/mac/) and [babbel](http://www.babbelirc.com/index.lasso?go=download) are popular clients.  For you linux users if you cannot manage to find an IRC client or connect to freenode you have brought great shame.

There is also an awesome browser based client for freenode found [here](http://webchat.freenode.net/).  But that ruins all the fun :(

3) So I just wasted like 5 seconds downloading these stupid programs now what?

You have to connect to freenode.  For many of the clients, freenode is a default server, for those that it isn't, check out [this](http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml) page to find the closest freenode server to connect to.

4) K, I'm connected.  Now what?

You want to join us on #reddit-r4r.

5) K, then what?

Seriously?  Start chatting.

So we need to establish some ground rules, obviously.  Much like how /r/r4r runs, we won't tolerate bigotry, threats, stalking, racism, and users under 18 years of age (regardless of country).

Myself (NewByRob) and Zeld4 (Zeld4 - boring I know), are on there, as well as some awesome users from /r/sex who helped us get our footing.

My taste in movies has been described as somewhat...eclectic. I can find equal enjoyment in German art films from the 70s, cheesy romantic comedies, silent expressionist flicks, Transformers...and fucking Twilight.

I saw the first one fully expecting to hate it but found myself absorbed by the goofy melodrama of it all. It's like watching a stupid soap opera--I know it's bad *but I can't look away.* I watched the other two on DVD and got hooked (I am most definitely Team Edward). And I really want to see the new one in the theater...but I can't find anyone to see it with.

I'm new to the area and haven't met too many people yet. Of the friends I do have, none of the guys would be caught dead seeing a Twilight movie in a theater (even the ones who glance over their shoulders and confess to me in hushed tones that they do kinda, sorta like the movies), and the women either despise Twilight or think that I'm pandering to their interests to get laid. And it's actually slightly less embarrassing to let them think that than to insist that no, I do really like Twilight that much.

I'm almost resigned to just going by myself and wearing my shame for all to see, but I thought I'd reach out to Reddit and see if there are any cool ladies out there who'd want to come along. I promise I have more interests than just Twilight (including, but not limited to: cooking delicious meals, having awkward conversations with random strangers, seeing how many envelopes I can lick in an hour and then trying to break that record, etc.). If you like Twilight, great. If you're Team Jacob, even better (we can argue about it!). If you don't like Twilight and just want to come to make fun of it/me, that's cool too.

I've recently begun noticing how penises differ across different races and I've taken an interest in it; it's not sexual, just sort of a hobby or something.

Basically, I'm looking for strangers who wouldn't mind showing their penis (flaccid or erect or both) on webcam anonymously. I'm specifically looking for people of certain races, but I don't mind people who are shy or would like to give it a try/get some input on their junk.

I'm specifically looking for someone whose ancestry is (one person for each) Native American, Chinese, Japanese, Nordic, and Indian. I'm also interested in finding someone with a tight foreskin, just because I've never encountered a real person with one. These are the traits I'm most interested in, though I'm also interested in a lot of other races to a lesser extent.

Ideally, I'm looking for people between 20 and 30 with average builds or skinnier, and heavily prefer if they were uncircumcised; my experience is that circumcised penises generally look the same and lose a lot of the details. Also, I don't have anything against older guys or heavier guys, but age and weight tend to change the way it looks.

**I'd also like to stress that I'd prefer this to stay anonymous.** I don't want to see your face, learn your name, or start a relationship with you; in fact, it needs to be clear that I'm not sexually interested in you. You aren't going to get anything from me no matter how hard you beg or how desperate you get. I'm only looking for guys who want to flap their dick around to a stranger for a minute or two, just for the hell of it.

I'd definitely like to get to know someone first before immediately jumping into anything. I'm laying out my intentions, though. Whatever the experience level is fine, I'd probably even feel more comfortable with someone who has little experience like me. Even cuddling would be great. Some able bodied people might not realize how nice simple touching helps a disabled person's body awareness that is typically hindered by lack of mobility. 

Anyone who reads this, male or female, I'd be greatly appreciative if even if you're not interested, you could possibly help me find someone.

So these things are terrifying to write. Apparently. I’ve typed like four different copies out, and each is sounding more and more like one of those cheesy dating show videos from the 80’s (although I unfortunately don’t have their glorious mustaches), so I bear with me if this sounds stupid. It’s actually pretty tough. 

Essentially, I move around pretty constantly, and while I’ve made a bunch of friends and have an awesome social circle right now, a lot of them are traveling or working full time this summer, so I’m going to be left pretty bored. I don’t have any idea of what I’m looking for really. A nice, clever person who can make me laugh is pretty much a requirement, though. And I’m straight, so while I’m sure all you lady Redditors are lovely and friendships would be awesome, it wouldn’t be romantic. I’m a lot younger than the average person on this subreddit, too, so someone who’s not twice as old as me would be great. 


I should probably talk about me now. Hm…I like long walks on the beach, stargazing, and going to farmer’s markets to check out – shit. It’s starting to sound all retro again. Seriously, I like to think I’m a pretty interesting person and passably attractive. I’m not very nerdy and don’t play video games, but if you do that’s awesome! Maybe you could teach me. 

Oh shit! I’d write more, but this is already longer than everyone else’s.

I'm a submissive. I'm messy, scatterbrained, aloof, mouthy, and flagrant. I want a farm and kids someday, but I need a strong, sharp, inspiring, meticulous, and humble woman to command me to clean, organize, shut-up, think-through, and properly conduct myself.

I'm intelligent enough to see the big picture (usually), and I'm well read in mythology, philosophy, social history, etc., with half a liberal arts education and the mind and spirit of an artistan farmer. I enjoy the finer luxuries in life, but I believe in sustainable, low-impact living in all situations for which it is appropriate.

I strive to eat well and excercise and it has done my figure favors. I appreciate the same efforts in other people. I like playing sports like basketball and soccer. I also enjoy rock-climbing, skiing, martial arts, yoga, dancing, sailing, kayaking, swimming, and light workouts.

I love crossdressing. I love feminine dresses, and the restrictive nature of fine ladies' clothing such as girdles, corsets, bras and garters. I love the feeling of a string between my cheeks. I love wearing the highest heels I can, and being taller than tall! I love the makeup and the lipstick and the mascara! I love looking pretty, sultry or radiant. I like messing with my hair and painting my nails. I hate shaving... but I love the look and feel of smooth skin!!!

My other big kink is bondage. I like being tied up, chained, restrained or otherwise immobilized. 

I'm not sharing pictures... yet... so you all will have to suffice that I am what I say I am.

I'm attracted to kind, thoughtful, independent people of all gender/sexual orientations. I like nice, honest, thoughtful people that are as easy-going as I am!

                &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am a world traveler, currently underworld traveling. I love variety, New foods, new people, colors, strangeness, scenery which is weird to say because I am an amateur sculptor and all my art is kind of bland as hell.

           &gt;&gt;&gt; In my spare time I love hiking and getting out into nature especially if its with good friends, good food, and some dogs, don't I &lt;3 cats too :P I play basketball and I like exploring just about anything. If you have an awesome hobby I bet I would like it. (excluding underwater basketweaving.) I love books, old and new, If you like ancient history I am your guy, Neil Gainman is a good freind my favorite author. I love movies too and video games.

        &gt;&gt;My favorite color is Turqoise. my favorite animal is a Mongolian duck. lets see other important things.....I feel like I am forgetting something, OH I am Libral libratarian. (Is it weird that I thought of colors and animals before politics?)

    &gt;I do IT stuff that often resembles manual labor, my degree is still a crime in progress. I have ambitions and goals and all those other life fiddly bits like you have but we can get to those later.

What are your cliff notes??

I hope you all had a great weekend, I did.  You might remember me from [this post about a month ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/18sjcp/25_m4f_disabled_guy_i_havent_cum_in_a_while/) It got a lot of upvotes and positive comments, some people even messaged me and it seemed like it was going somewhere but it has kind of stalled out. I talked with a lot of different people who were supportive in different ways, I even had one person offered to help out, and while it was awesome, I just wasn't able to get the job done (my fault).  I took some advice and made a profile over on OkQ, but I have not had anybody message me and the people I have message haven't returned. I realize what I'm asking for is cray-cray, but there are 3 billion women out there, one of them has to be interested in what I am after. If you are, or even if you think you are, or even if you just want to talk about life, send me a message. I'm a nice guy and a great listener. Anyways, be cool.

I know this is weird but I have an interview in Columbus on Wednesday and Thursay dont want to pay for a hotel for one night, Id rather pay for drinks or something for a fellow redditor. So if you are interested in letting some not psycho redditor stay on your couch for a night let me know. 

Edit: Just got back from my sales training/ interview. Looking back that did look confusing and sketchy. I got back yesterday stayed on one of your couches and the person I stayed with didn't kill me and I didn't kill him, which is already a great success. Gave me a tour of downtown Columbus and OSUs campus. Super nice person and I owe him so much because he did save me some money and showed me a side of Columbus I wouldn't have seen if I stayed at a hotel. Just edited this to say thank you that person again and looking forward to going back there very soon.

I am just not sure where to begin. I promise that if you could see my face right now, you would go "" Awwww!"" and completely forgive any transgression I make below. I do this puppy eye thing with a sad face when I am nervous and unsure that I am sure will get me out of anything (complete lie, probably).

I am looking for chatty new friends who love words and making connections. I could write for ages. You should let me write at you. Life is about making connections. I love making connections, try to make them daily, but should definitely make more. I could be your new friends. Surely, you don't have enough. There is always room for one more.    

Who am I? I am lovely, probably. I like to think I am witty, but that is all probably in my head. I love being outside, and the exploring new places. I give the best hugs. I love a good laugh, and smiling is something that just comes so naturally to me. Well, it should come naturally to everyone. It is sad when it doesn't. I could tell you jokes! They are probably terrible, maybe a little bit inappropriate, but you might laugh. 

*Disclaimer: My jokes are terrible. You will not laugh.*

I could tell you more about me here, but then what would we talk about in messages in such. 

Oh, I make pies. I love making pies. I could make a pie for you if you lived close enough. Can you send pies in the regular post? Surely not. I adore coffee and drink way too much of it. 

I am in the U.S, but I love talking to people from anywhere. 

You should like to use words or at least reading them because I will type bunches. We probably won't talk about politics, condiments, fruit with hair on it (fuzzy fruit), or gaming. I don't much like those things so I probably won't be able to carry on much of a conversation on them.

I like to ask questions and answer them. I love the way people feel and experience life, and I would love to hear your story. 
 
If you live in my area, or if you ever visit it, we could meet and get coffee or tea, or just explore some new place together. I love travel buddies.

Let's converse, meet, or whatever!  
  
If you take the time to write, I will take the time to answer in kind. Not doing so would just be rude.

I am just a wreck. I have become very pathetic i spend almost every waking hour that i am not at work trying to find a friend.
I have none anymore.. I was put threw some very hard stuff somethings that were extremely painful. I won't get into it but.. I was once the person who was there for so many .. now i have no one..
I m just hurting so bad i only want a friend.
the worst part is i came so close the other day and lost it.. 

let me be clear tho i want someone to talk to for awhile.
someone who is interested in being a friend.
not someone who is going to talk to me for five min and walk away
or just add me to there messenger list and abandon me.
strange enough the person who was always around for people has huge abandonment issues and now trust issues.

i am telling people this in hopes someone will be compassionate and help. 
im not looking for advice, just someone to care.
its easier for me to talk to women but anyone will do..

I'm a nerdy scientist, atheist, and animal lover (so, a typical redditor). I moved out to the bay area a couple of years ago in order to get my graduate degree.  My main forms of recreation are potlucks/hanging out with friends,  hiking/camping/birding, and reading. I'm particularly a fan of the fantasy genera, though I will read just about anything. I generally don't watch a lot of TV or movies, though I recently became addicted to the new Doctor Who. Anyone interested in watching it with me? I'm pretty adventurous, and try to live by the motto of ""I'll try anything (that won't maim or kill me) once"". Seriously. Try me on this, it is how I discovered that worms can be quite tasty. I love to travel and my next goal is South America.  I'm not really into alcohol or drugs, though I try to keep an open mind. I like to be constantly intellectually stimulated- I'd much rather go to a museum or wildlife sanctuary than a sports game or bar. I'm also looking for a D&amp;D/ other tabletop group, so if your party needs a member, feel free to contact me even if you're not interested in me romantically (I said I was a nerd).


I like nerdy, educated, thoughtful, openminded guys  (or maybe the right girl, though I've never dated a girl before). Honesty and openness are critical for me. I'm not great with traditional gender roles (I'm a total tomboy), and I want someone who accepts me and doesn't try to make me into a ""princess"" or something that I am not.
