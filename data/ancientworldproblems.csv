He dies in the first Punic war against some assholes in Siciy and I'm left with this whole god damn farm to myself and... Anyways, there been this fuckin guy who's been roaming the countryside for like, YEARS! But it's not just one guy, he's got like a thousand people following him with carts an armor and shields and spears and get this, ELEPHANTS! I shit you not. Motherfucking ELEPHANTS. Like 30 of em too. I'd never even seen an elephant until then.

We keep pleading to Rome for help and they said they ""know of the problem and are responding to it the best they can."" Beurocrats amiright?  Some people in town say Rome has sent some armies at em but that they all got killed. Yea like that's a plausible story. I mean sure the elephants are scary and all but come on this is ROME. And then this one dude told me he heard that they ""came over the Alps"" to get here. With all those elephants and shit? Yea fuckin right!

Anywho, this Dude has just been comin an goin, comin and goin, and every time he comes around his army just eats all my food, rapes all my animals, and his elephants shit all over my goddamn yard!

Well the wife turned out to be next to useless at anything other than baby making, only, she can't do it fast enough.

Well, I figured, hey, I can always get a new wife, why wait for a rotten kid? So I sold my pregnant wife (kind of a 2 for 1 deal, if I had more women I can see there being real money in this sort of thing). 


Using this money I figured I could buy my kids back from those Godless Gauls. They just laughed at me and took my money. I made a claim with the local Legion but they told me they could do nothing. I tell you, you pay taxes for protection, and this is what you get?
