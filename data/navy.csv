But it feels like every single day the front page is full of questions that can be easily answered by talking to a recruiter or googling an instruction.  This sub has become unenjoyable for me because it's so rare to see a good post that's applicable to the Navy **outside** a recruiter's office.  I don't come here to be a sea lawyer; I come here to see badass pics of people on Wog Day, share in the pride of others' reenlistments, get the heads up on new instructions, see memes about advancement or inspections...you know, stuff that has to do with the *actual* Navy (~~God~~ Neptune forbid).  Now I believe that we should be there for the pre-enlistees when they have a legitimate question (i.e., I think my recruiter is lying to me, I've looked everywhere but I'm getting different answers...) Yet all I see is ""What is (random rate) like?""  ""I'm a freshman in high school but..."" ""Am I too fat/skinny/ugly for boot camp?"" ""I'm going to MEPS in a month, how long before I leave?"" ""I can't run but I want to join, plz halp!""  Look, I know it sounds crazy but I was able to get all answers from my recruiter and I'm sure they can too.  The Navy assigns hard-working, outstanding individuals all over the country to answer the exact questions posted here.
The other downside to this is that if most of our users *aren't even in the Navy yet* we lose tons of them to boot camp and then they ditch the sub because they don't have anymore B.S. questions anymore.  I'd really like to see better quality submissions relevant to **Navy life**.  I realize it may be too much to ask, but I love my Navy and I still have hope for this subreddit.

We ploughed through the mud and razorgrass for fourteen hours a day, plagued by rain and mosquitoes, ducking under sniper fire all day and mortar fire all night. In a firefight, we'd fire until our arms ached and our guns were empty, then we'd charge the enemy with bayonets!""

Your first step will be finding a Navy [recruiter](http://www.navycs.com/districts.html). Like any other military applicant you will have to take the [ASVAB](http://www.navycs.com/asvab-test.html). If you score well enough on this test you will be given the option to become a nuke. If you do not qualify from baseline scores you may take another exam, the [NAPT](http://www.navycs.com/navy-nuclear-power-test.html) to determine your eligibility for the nuclear program.  The test is mostly math, mechanical, and electrical. 


*What if I have I have some problems with my past?*

You will have to speak to your 

*Who is the best fit for the program?*

Single young adults (18-24) with some interest in [STEM fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields) and not afraid of hard work and long hours.  

If you are coming out of high school, it’s not a bad idea. A good applicant will be kinda bright, not really sure what to do, and have no money for school. 

It’s also really awesome if you dropped out of college…you probably have a lot of debt and little job skills. The Navy will force study habits on you and help with your student debt.

If you have finished college, there’s no reason to be enlisted. You may be an officer, however this is not covered in this guide.

If you are in any sort of non-married relationship, consider breaking it off (sadly). You will almost no communication during boot camp, school will take up most of the time for the following 2 years, and when you get to your sea command it’s even less time. Married Navy life is extremely difficult; give a lot of thought to the hardships you will experience with your spouse. 

If you are a female you may a harder time than your male counterparts – there are very few females, so they stand out (mostly for worst), are largely stripped of femininity and can’t go on subs (well for the time being, that’s slowly changing). 


*Why should I become a nuke?*

Money! Nukes are the highest paid enlisted service members (or close to it). You will have the highest enlistment bonus (last I heard around $12,000), re-enlistment bonus (changes all the time, but I think it’s around $100k now), make rank faster (which is more money), and get a special nuke pay.

Along with the pay, nukes have some of the more translatable skills when it comes to the civilian sector. There are a lot of jobs not only in the nuclear field, but all the energy fields.  I’ll cover more about getting out at the end. 

If you want to become an officer, Nukes also make a strong candidate.

 
*Why shouldn’t I become a nuke?*

Well, they are throwing huge amounts of cash at you for a reason. You will be the first one on the boat for startups and last one off. You will have the most working hours and have the most stressful enlisted job. 
Nukes also have the least flexibility – you won’t be eligible for SEALS or other special programs. You won’t be able to cross rate.  Nukes also have the most limited opportunities for shore duty. Also, your initial enlistment is 6 years, the longest of any rate (or at least tied for it).


*Can I finish college while I’m in?*

Maybe, probably not. Your recruiter will probably try to sell this to you and it’s mostly false.  While your classes in the nuclear power pipeline are probably as hard as college classes, very few schools accept these as credits, and even fewer of those are accredited (you will want ABET accreditation). You won’t be able to take any classes while you are in nuclear power school, and it’s a crap shoot on how receptive your sea command is to it (mine wasn’t at all). You will have a better chance if you go aircraft carriers.

Again, it’s also a crapshoot at your shore command but if you are committed you should be able to take classes since you will be working less. 

The post 9/11 GI Bill is available when you get out, but it’s not as an awesome of a deal as it’s sold. There’s a lot of restrictions and fine print; it’s also being weakened every day by the government so if you are joining today, expect it to look nothing like it is right now.


*What rate should I be?*

Unlike just about every other rate in the Navy, you enter the Nuclear Power Program and they tell you what rate you will be. There are 3 choices: Machinist’s Mate (MM), Electronic’s Mate (EM), and Electronic Technician (ET). 

MMs obviously work with the mechanical equipment (pipes, valves, turbines...anything that goes roundy roundy). EMs typically work on everything electrical not involving the reactor while the ETs work on the reactor electrical components. There is much more electrical gear for the EMs, but the ETs work is more politically sensitive and requires a ton of paperwork.

Like getting your hands dirty? Pick MM or EM, based on your preference for electrical or mechanical work.

Like paperwork? Pick ET.

MMs also get a chance to be an Engineering Laboratory Technician (ELT) later on. They primarily work with water chemistry and radiation/contamination (RADCON). Their job is also politically sensitive so they have a lot of paperwork as well. 

From a working hours perspective, MMs usually work the most in port, EMs at sea, and ETs/ELTs work the least all the time.  

Most applicants pick ET due to the attractiveness of a longer school but they are also the least manned of the 3 rates, so regardless of what you pick your chance of becoming an ET is the smallest.


*Is the job safe?*

Well, there are a few aspects of safe.
From a radiation perspective, yes. You’ll get all the math and studies when you go through school, but the gist is you will get less radiation than someone who works outside for a living (the sun being their source). Your dosage is monitored very closely and your exposure will be as limited as possible. 

From a military perspective – who knows? Remember you are on a ship of war and may be called on to fight at any time. I don’t have a crystal ball to know will happen, however Nukes only serve on submarines and Aircraft Carriers…and all things considered they are some of the safer places to be at a time of war. 

From an industrial environment perspective, I think the Navy does a good job of safety (they go way overboard most of the time actually). There’s a lot of things that can go wrong however and sailors have died. I don’t have numbers but as long as you follow procedures your safety is in your hands.


*What is boot camp like?*

Sucks.  I found it boring and tedious but mileage varies. Just get through it and don’t take anything personally.  You’ll hear a lot of stories about Nukes too – none of them are true.

Be very aware of what you guys post in here and what information about yourself you post. Like an earlier post some people took offense to this new sailors responses. As I've said before you'd be surprised how undermanned we are, but on that same note that means this. It's a small ass Navy, everyone know someone who knows someone. Sure you don't know us, but a lurker in this sub could be an NC1, FC1, IT1, anything that could potentially use the attitude you use here and remember you when you get to command x or y.
""I never said my name, Just my reddit name I don't care!"" Well it's not that hard for anyone to call the base information number, find your boats info, ask the quarterdeck for your shops number, EXAMPLE


* Quarter DECK "" USS Neverhome quarterdeck, please be advised this is a non secured line, how can I help you Sir or Ma'am.""


* Lurker Sailor: ""I need to speak with the LPO of shop X about one of his new check ins.""

Point is, you never know who knows who, or what you might say might be misconstrued as being disrespectful. So for all future reference please remember this.

1350074196.0,34,self.navy,11dtct,Nuclear Navy FAQs / Guide (x-post from Militaryfaq),furniture_exorcist,39,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/11dtct/nuclear_navy_faqs_guide_xpost_from_militaryfaq/,"I posted to Militaryfaq awhile ago, but since I've started to browse r/navy, I've seen similar questions so I thought I would post this here as well. It's fairly long so look for a part 2 in the comments.

I’m hitting my 3 years out of the Navy point and I thought I would celebrate by contributing to the enlisted nuclear community. I’m going to run down the questions my pre-Navy high school self would (and should) have asked. Please note that while most of info is up to date, things change all the time in the Navy so don’t rely on this as your only source. I was also a submariner so that’s the perspective I’m bringing – the surface fleet isn’t entirely the same.

About me: I was a Nuclear Machinist’s Mate (MM1) for ~9 ½ years.  I joined the Navy out of high school. I found high school pretty easy, but put little effort into it for about a B average. I spent most of my time in Hawaii on a fast attack sub and then the shipyard there. I now work in the pharmaceutical industry. 


*How do I become a nuke?*

Like any other military applicant you will have to take the ASVAB. If you score well enough on this test (around 80th percentile I believe) you will be given the option to take another exam to determine your eligibility for the nuclear program.  The test is mostly math, mechanical, and electrical. I wasn't a recruiter so I’m not up to date on the latest and greatest of Nuke entry, but I believe it’s still similar.


*Who is the best fit for the program?*

Single young adults (18-24) with some interest in STEM fields and not afraid of hard work and long hours.  

If you are coming out of high school, it’s not a bad idea, especially if you were anything like me. Kinda bright, not really sure what to do, and no money for school. 

It’s also really awesome if you dropped out of college…you probably have a lot of debt and little job skills. The Navy will force study habits on you and help with your student debt.

If you have finished college, there’s no reason to be enlisted. You may be an officer which I’m not going to cover.

If you are in any sort of non-married relationship, I recommend breaking it off (sadly). You will almost no communication during boot camp, school will take up most of the time for the following 2 years, and when you get to your sea command it’s even less time.  Married Navy life is extremely difficult and I would never recommend it. 

It's my opinion that females will have a harder time than there male counterparts – there are very few females, so they stand out (mostly for worst), are largely stripped of femininity and can’t go on subs (well for the time being, that’s slowly changing). 


*Why should I become a nuke?*

Money! Nukes are the highest paid enlisted service members (or close to it). You will have the highest enlistment bonus (last I heard around $45,000), re-enlistment bonus (changes all the time, but I think it’s around $100k now), make rank faster (which is more money), and get a special nuke pay.

Along with the pay, nukes have some of the more translatable skills when it comes to the civilian sector. There are a lot of jobs not only in the nuclear field, but all the energy fields.  I’ll cover more about getting out at the end. 

If you want to become an officer, Nukes also make a strong candidate.

 
*Why shouldn’t I become a nuke?*

Well, they are throwing huge amounts of cash at you for a reason. You will be the first one on the boat for startups and last one off. You will have the most working hours and have the most stressful enlisted job. 
Nukes also have the least flexibility – you won’t be eligible for SEALS or other special programs. You won’t be able to cross rate.  Nukes also have the most limited opportunities for shore duty. 


*Can I finish college while I’m in?*

Maybe, probably not. Your recruiter will probably try to sell this to you and it’s mostly false.  While your classes in the nuclear power pipeline are probably as hard as college classes, very few schools accept these as credits, and even fewer of those are accredited (you will want ABET accreditation). You won’t be able to take any classes while you are in nuclear power school, and it’s a crap shoot on how receptive your sea command is to it (mine wasn’t at all). You will have a better chance if you go aircraft carriers.

Again, it’s also a crapshoot at your shore command but if you are committed you should be able to take classes since you will be working less. 

The post 9/11 GI Bill is available when you get out, but it’s not as an awesome of a deal as it’s sold. There’s a lot of restrictions and fine print; it’s also being weakened every day by the government so if you are joining today, expect it to look nothing like it is right now.


*What rate should I be?*

Unlike just about every other rate in the Navy, you enter the Nuclear Power Program and they tell you what rate you will be. There are 3 choices: Machinist’s Mate (MM), Electronic’s Mate (EM), and Electronic Technician (ET). 

MMs obviously work with the mechanical equipment (pipes, valves, turbines...anything that goes roundy roundy). EMs typically work on everything electrical not involving the reactor while the ETs work on the reactor electrical components. There is much more electrical gear for the EMs, but the ETs work is more politically sensitive and requires a ton of paperwork.

Like getting your hands dirty? Pick MM or EM, based on your preference for electrical or mechanical work.

Like paperwork? Pick ET.

MMs also get a chance to be an Engineering Laboratory Technician (ELT) later on. They primarily work with water chemistry and radiation/contamination (RADCON). Their job is also politically sensitive so they have a lot of paperwork as well. 

From a working hours perspective, MMs usually work the most in port, EMs at sea, and ETs/ELTs work the least all the time.  

Most applicants pick ET due to the attractiveness of a longer school but they are also the least manned of the 3 rates, so regardless of what you pick your chance of becoming an ET is the smallest.


*Is the job safe?*

Well, there are a few aspects of safe.
From a radiation perspective, yes. You’ll get all the math and studies when you go through school, but the gist is you will get less radiation than someone who works outside for a living (the sun being their source). Your dosage is monitored very closely and your exposure will be as limited as possible. 

From a military perspective – who knows? Remember you are on a ship of war and may be called on to fight at any time. I don’t have a crystal ball to know will happen, however Nukes only serve on submarines and Aircraft Carriers…and all things considered they are some of the safer places to be at a time of war. 

From an industrial environment perspective, I think the Navy does a good job of safety (they go way overboard most of the time actually). There’s a lot of things that can go wrong however and sailors have died. I don’t have numbers but as long as you follow procedures your safety is in your hands.


*What is boot camp like?*

Sucks.  I found it boring and tedious but mileage varies. Just get through it and don’t take anything personally.  You’ll hear a lot of stories about Nukes too – none of them are true. 


*Where to next?*

It’s off to Charleston, SC for “A” school and power school. You start there with very few freedoms, and by the time power school starts, you’ll be close to being treated like an adult. You will be living in barracks if you are single (think of a dorm environment) and close base housing if married. 

The schools are a bit different than anywhere else – you will be given mandatory time which you have to study (meaning you have to physically come into the school house, no material leaves the building). The amount of time will be based on how well you do on tests.
Some protips: If you are less than 21 years old, DO NOT DRINK. I know that advice will most likely be ignored by the age group I’m trying to talk to, but it’s the easiest and most frequent way to be removed from the program or reduced in rate setting you back months or years. There’s a very witch hunt type atmosphere around drinking and I would avoid it as much as possible. 

For a lot of sailors this will be the first time making a real paycheck and having financial independence. Try to give yourself a budget and not live paycheck to paycheck. 

The Navy nuke schooling environment isn't very tolerant of the mixing of genders - stay out of the barracks from the opposite gender and don't even think of bringing a gf/bf back to your place.

Also remember as you go through the schooling part of your Navy Nuclear career, the better you do, the more options you have later on. Better grades mean better choices on your first sea command and even affect your shore duty no matter how well you actually did on the boat.  


*What about “A” school?*

“A” school is where you learn your trade skill. I’m pretty mechanically declined so I found it a bit rough, but manageable. The time varies based on your rate, but it’s around 3 months long. For a majority of students it’s the first time where they have to apply some semblance of study skills. For me it was about 2-3 hours after class.
I don’t know what the attrition rate is, but it’s fairly low; for students that actually care and want to get by, it’s probably &lt;5%. Most of the sailors removed are because they decided they don’t like the program or they drink underage.
 

*What about Power School?*

It’s a bit harder than “A” school, but not as much as the hype I was given. Again, for students that actually want to get through it’s probably &lt;5% fail and the same amount are removed for discipline reasons.  The school is 6 months long and moves through at a pretty blistering pace. There’s a lot to learn, but that’s probably why you signed up to be a nuke so it’s fairly engaging.

First off, I realize DOMA is going to prevent us from receiving benefits, but should we still report our marriage to the Navy? I also know that Panetta put out that memo about domestic partners getting IDs but has anything happened with that so far?

I'm also looking for any idea of what I can expect in terms of dealing with the Navy as a spouse. Obviously this is far more complicated than normal but any basics that may help with day to day life would be appreciated. I've checked out some of the related subs but found little help. I'm mostly thinking about things that may come up or may be good to plan for during a deployment. Husband is a sub officer so anything relevant to that such as dealing with the lack of communication would be of particular interest.

From tucking in PT shirts, to unauthorized wear of clothing with a uniform, to hair and mustache, and black, and even multicolored socks with PT.

1375311455.0,29,self.navy,1jgdr9,FeralTexan explains how to simulate life aboard a US Navy Warship in your house,FeralTexan,55,26,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/1jgdr9/feraltexan_explains_how_to_simulate_life_aboard_a/,"HOW TO SIMULATE SHIPBOARD LIFE AT HOME

	When commencing this simulation, remember to lock yourself inside and board up all windows with all friends and family outside, communicating only with letters that your neighbors will hold for two weeks before delivering and losing one out of every five. Have a friend or neighbor yell “Mail Call” at your door; four out of five times saying, “You didn’t get anything.”

	Surround yourself with 500 to 6,000 people you don’t like and know; people who chain smoke, fart loudly, snore like a Mack truck on an uphill grade, complain constantly, seldom shower or brush their teeth, and use expletives in speech the way children use sugar on cold cereal.

	Cut a twin mattress in half, lengthwise, and enclose the sides. Add a roof that prevents you from sitting in any position at all (10 inches is a good height) and place it on a platform so that it is at least six inches off the floor and has a wall surrounding three sides in order to prevent you from tucking in the sheets. Place a dead animal under your sheets to simulate the smell of your bunkmate’s laundry and sheets. Whenever possible, have someone take your pillow and blanket (or both) to simulate that special camaraderie that exists only on US Navy ship.

	Remove all plants, pictures and decorations. Paint all furnishings and walls gray, white or the green shade of hospital O.R. smocks.

	Prepare yourself for an emergency that will require you to evacuate the premises knowing that if you exit, the biker gang that you hired will cut off your arms and lets you simulate sharks. Study a first aid book to learn how to handle wounds and control bleeding. Do this until you can quote it verbatim.

	Unplug all radios and televisions to completely cut yourself off from the outside world. Have a neighbor bring you a time or a Newsweek magazine from 2 or 3 months ago.

	Monitor all operating home appliances hourly, recording all vital parameters (plugged in, light functions when door opens, etc). If not in use, log appliance as secured.

	Do not flush the toilet for the first three days to simulate the smell of 80 people using the same commode. After that, flush once daily. Shower water should be either all hot or cold. When you get all soaped up, (soap on face, shampoo in hair) have your neighbor shut off all the water.

	Wear only approved coveralls or proper uniform (no special or cut-off T-shirts.) Even though nobody cares, once a week clean and press one uniform, in the dark, on a broken ironing board (or a towel on the floor) and wear it for 20 minutes while standing at attention. After this, change back into coveralls, catch and rip the sleeve of your shirt on a sharp object on your way to change, curse and yell. Then wad it up and throw it in the locker.

	 Cut your hair weekly, making it shorter each time until you are bald or look like you tangled with sharp sheep shearer. Have a friend or neighbor tell you to get a haircut at least every other day, whether you need it or not.

	Work 18 hour cycles. Sleep ONLY four hours at a time to ensure your body doesn’t know or care if it is daytime or nighttime.

	Listen to your favorite cassette six times a day for two weeks. Then play music that causes acute nausea and tension headaches until you are glad to get back to your “favorite” cassette.

	Set your alarm clock to go off at the snooze interval for the first hour of sleep, to simulate alarms of watchstanders and night crew, going off at odd times and ensure you are tossed from side to side for the remaining three hours. Alternately use custom alarm clocks that sound like a fire alarm, police whistle, and a punk rock band combined, to simulate various drill alarms onboard the ship, and so you will get accustomed to ignoring your alarm clock.

	Prepare all food while blindfolded, using all the spices that you can grab for, or none at all, to simulate shipboard food. Remove the blindfold and eat as fast as humanly possible. If the food does not stick to an inverted plate when cold, use more lard. If the food contains more than one part per thousand of fiber, dispose of it. Always take more than you can possibly eat, to keep up with the waste standards of the Navy.

	Buy a gas mask, smear the seal with rancid animal fat, scrub the lens with steel wool until you can’t see out of it and wear it for two hours, every fifth day or less, even to the bathroom.

	Study the owner’s manual for all appliances in the house. At regular intervals, take one apart, then, put it back together again. Test its operations to the extreme of its tolerance.

	Discard any rolls of toilet tissue that you have in your house. Take several sheets of thin cardboard and cut them into long strips, dip them in water until they are completely soaked, then hang them out in your garage to dry for several days. When they are completely dry, place them about the floor of your bathroom. This will be your toilet tissue.

	To make sure that you are living in a clean and happy environment, every week clean from top to bottom, working hard all day, even if its only a three hour job, whenever, and as often as possible, repeating your efforts. Then have a friend or neighbor tell you that you missed some dust, and the floor looks like crap. When completed, have another friend inspect your work, criticizing everything as much as possible. Never be satisfied with a good effort.

	Every three weeks, to simulate liberty in a foreign port, go directly to the city slums, wearing your best clothes. Enter the raunchiest bar you can find and ask the bartender for the most expensive imported beer he carries. Drink as many of these as fast as you possible can in four hours and then hire a cab to take you home by the longest route he can find. Tip the cab driver after he charges you double, because you were dressed funny, and lock yourself in your house for another three or twelve weeks.

	Run a blender on a constant  high speed, to simulate the constant whine of the ship’s machinery, and have the biker gang bang on the walls and room to simulate people working on other levels during all hours of the day and night.

	Buy the loudest stereo that you can, tune it between channels on the receiver, and have the biker gang pound on your roof to simulate helo operations.

	To achieve the permanent, smelly and dingy look in your clothes, have the plumber connect the washer to the sewer lines. After washing, throw the wet clothing in a dark corner for two days before drying. Go through your underwear drawer and discard every third sock. Take the remaining socks and cut holes at random in the toes and heels. Damage all elastic bands.

	This simulation must run for a minimum of three months to be effective. The exact date of the end of simulation will be changed no fewer than seven times without your knowledge. This is done to keep you guessing as to when you can expect to get back to a semi-normal life. It is also done in hope of screwing up the plans you have made, or would like to make. On the last day if simulation, remove the boards from the window, but do not go outside. Have your loved ones stand outside, across the street, while you stand at attention for four hours, just looking at them.

I like standing on the bridge wing at sunrise with salt spray in my face and clean ocean winds whipping in from the four quarters of the globe – the ship beneath me feeling like a living thing as her engines drive her through the sea.

I like the sounds of the Navy – the piercing trill of the boatswains pipe, the syncopated clangor of the ship’s bell on the quarterdeck, the harsh squawk of the 1MC and the strong language and laughter of sailors at work.

I like Navy vessels – nervous darting destroyers, plodding fleet auxiliaries, sleek submarines and steady solid carriers. I like the proud names of Navy ships: Midway, Lexington, Saratoga, Coral Sea – memorials of great battles won. I like the lean, angular names of Navy ‘tin-cans’: Barney, Dahlgren, Mullinix, Walton, mementos of heroes who went before us.

I like the tempo of a Navy band blaring through the topside speakers as we pull away from the oiler after refueling at sea. I like liberty call and the spicy scent of a foreign port. I even like all hands working parties as my ship fills herself with the multitude of supplies both mundane and exotic which she needs to cut her ties to the land and carry out her mission anywhere on the globe where there is water to float her.

I like sailors, men from all parts of the land, farms of the Midwest, small towns of New England, from the cities, the mountains and the prairies, from all walks of life. I trust and depend on them as they trust and depend on me – for professional competence, for comradeship, for courage. In a word, they are “shipmates.”

I like the surge of adventure in my heart when the word is passed “Now station the special sea and anchor detail – all hands to quarters for leaving port”, and I like the infectious thrill of sighting home again, with the waving hands of welcome from family and friends waiting pierside.

The work is hard and dangerous, the going rough at times, the parting from loved ones painful, but the companionship of robust Navy laughter, the ‘all for one and one for all’ philosophy of the sea is ever present. I like the serenity of the sea after a day of hard ship’s work, as flying fish flit across the wave tops and sunset gives way to night.

I like the feel of the Navy in darkness – the masthead lights, the red and green navigation lights and stern light, the pulsating phosphorescence of  radar repeaters – they cut through the dusk and join with the mirror of stars overhead. And I like drifting off to sleep lulled by the myriad noises large and small that tell me that my ship is alive and well, and that my shipmates on watch will keep me safe. I like quiet midwatches with the aroma of strong coffee – the lifeblood of the Navy – permeating everywhere.

And I like hectic watches when the exacting minuet of haze-gray shapes racing at flank speed keeps all hands on a razor edge of alertness. I like the sudden electricity of “General quarters, general quarters, all hands man your battle stations”, followed by the hurried clamor of running feet on ladders and the resounding thump of watertight doors as the ship transforms herself in a few brief seconds from a peaceful workplace to a weapon of war – ready for anything.
And I like the sight of space-age equipment manned by youngsters clad in dungarees and sound-powered phones that their grandfathers would still recognize. I like the traditions of the Navy and the men and women who made them. I like the proud names of Navy heroes: Halsey, Nimitz, Perry, Farragut, John Paul Jones. A sailor can find much in the Navy: comrades-in-arms, pride in self and country, mastery of the seaman’s trade. An adolescent can find adulthood.

In years to come, when sailors are home from the sea, they will still remember with fondness and respect the ocean in all its moods – the impossible shimmering mirror calm and the storm-tossed green water surging over the bow. And then there will come again a faint whiff of stack gas, a faint echo of engine and rudder orders, a vision of the bright bunting of signal flags snapping at the yardarm, a refrain of hearty laughter in the wardroom and chief’s quarters and messdecks. Gone ashore for good they will grow wistful about their Navy days, when the seas belonged to them and a new port of call was ever over the horizon. Remembering this, they will stand taller and say, “I WAS A SAILOR ONCE. I WAS PART OF THE NAVY &amp; THE NAVY  WILL ALWAYS BE PART OF ME.”

ET3,

Verify the date of the NIIN assignment.

You will be able to procure a 1980 model snow mobile for ~$37, thereby saving the Navy an enormous amount of funding. I suggest you verify the appropriate open purchase procedures through LS3 Openpurchaseguy or LS2 Otheropenpurchaseguy.

Stop wasting valuable Naval resources and precious working hours on such frivolous pursuits.

Your lack of dedication as a sailor and shipmate is a constant source of disappointment to our hard working and dedicated leadership. They lack the temporal resources to deal with your tomfoolery. 

As it stands, their dedication to the finely honed art and craft of Naval leadership and proper procedure does not allow them the time or opportunity to procure vitally needed material (their sacrifice is duly noted) for something as unimportant as ships mission. What type of position to you think that will leave them in when it comes to meeting every single one of your pointless whims? There is SURFLANT paperwork to be done GOD FUCKING DAMNIT!

I apologize for my unprofessional outburst. Such conduct is unbecoming of a professional deckplate leader and esteemed peer mentor.

It is my sincere hope that you will take a round turn on your behavior and begin to exemplify your Naval core values as a model to our younger sailors. As it stands your commitment is deeply lacking and must be remedied at the earliest opportunity.

Let me know if you require any assistance in bettering yourself as a man and as a Petty Officer. I will aid you in seeking the appropriate command mentorship if this is the path you desire.

1376678386.0,21,self.navy,1ki58q,What are the Navy's expectations toward shaving?,RavenDT,46,25,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/1ki58q/what_are_the_navys_expectations_toward_shaving/,"I happened to be in the smoke pit today, and was conversing with a civilian about a prior dispute I had concerning my shave, or lack thereof.  This was something that happened probably a year ago.

The event happened like this:  Being assigned to a watch, I had a rotating schedule. My schedule would be typically three days on, four days off, four days on, three days off, etc.  I was on my four days off when I get a call from my LPO stating that they had corrections for me to make on my eval and needed me to make corrections before 1400 that day.  I received this phone call at 1000, and I was still in bed.  I rogered up, got out of bed, took a shower, got dressed in civilian clothes, opted not to shave, and drove to where my LPO and Chief were at.

I enter the building.  Being in a joint environment, there were a lot of Army folk there.  Each one that recognized me seemed to be giving me an incredulous look.  More to follow on that.  I find my Chief, he apologizes for calling me on my day off and thanks me for coming in right away to make corrections on my eval.  I take the package from him and begin working on it.

Throughout the two hours I was sitting at a random desk (mind you, I don't work in the building at all), fixing my eval, I get approached by a couple different Army guys who recognized me and asked me about my shave.  My response, ""It's my day off, I'm not on duty, I am not in uniform, and therefore am not required to shave.""  ""Well, in the Army, blah blah blah.""  ""Sorry, bro, but last time I checked, I am not in the Army.""

Time passes, I continue to work on my eval, and then get approached by my Division officer (DIVO).  He asked me how my eval was coming, and I said, ""Good, Sir.  I am just about finished.""  Then he asks me about my shave.  As it turns out, the Army folks who had approached me didn't like my response [although I was respectful to them, (I really didn't say, ""Sorry, bro..."")]. I tell him the same thing.  He asked if I know I am required to be shaved.  I asked if there was a command policy, because to my knowledge there wasn't one.  He said, ""Check the uniform regulations.""  I explain to him that he is incorrect, and he challenges me to pull them up. So I do.  I find the specific portion that pertains to shaving and I print it out.

Once I completed my eval, I went to turn it in to Chief and my DIVO asks about what I found.  I showed him the printed excerpt from the uniform regs that does not state that I am required to shave unless I am on duty and in uniform.  He concedes and then says, ""In the future, just please try to use your best judgement.""  ""I did, Sir.  The entire time I've been in the Navy, and at all the different duty stations and commands that I've been assigned to, I have never been told that I was required to shave on a day off out of uniform.  I thought my judgement was sound, but apparently not.""  And then I walked out.

Now fast-forward to today.  I am conversing with a civilian, and telling this story.  A Navy Captain (O-6 for the non-Navy people reading) happens to come into the smoke pit as well and overhears the conversation.  She begins to challenge me on it as well.  The way she put it was, ""It might not technically be wrong according the regulations, but it's a poor example to be setting for junior personnel.""

Hold the phone.  Following the uniform regulations and not doing anything wrong is setting a bad example?  If the Navy wanted us shaved 24/7, they would say, ""You are required to be clean shaven 24/7/365, regardless of leave or liberty status.""  They didn't, and as such, we are not required. The regulation states specifically, ""If you are in uniform, you are to be clean-shaven,"" unless you have a proper medical waiver/chit due to health reasons (no-shave chit), in which case you are to keep your facial hair trimmed.

So I respectfully ask her this.  She then proceeds to consult a new Chief and a CPO Selectee on the same matter.  They all agree that not shaving is not a ""mastable"" offense, but they would tell the person to go shave.  Again, I ask why, because it's not wrong, and they still reiterate that, ""It's not setting a good example for junior personnel.""

Again, I ask, how not being wrong and following regulations sets a bad example for junior personnel?

Also, I'd like to make a note, that the O-6 Captain, who was telling me this, did the following while trying to ""correct"" my way of thinking:

* She was in a covered smoking area with her cover on.  When under cover, you are supposed to remove your cover.  You wouldn't wear your cover indoors, so you shouldn't in a covered area.
* She had her other hand in her pants pocket.
* Her cover was stained on the front brim, and had a visible hole in it from excessive wear, meaning that her cover was unservicable and she shouldn't be wearing it.  It's not like it was damaged on the fly, that hole was worn in through extensive wearing and she should have replaced it a LONG time ago.
* She had her jacket unzipped 90% of the way (10% zipped). If you are wearing a jacket in uniform, it's supposed to be zipped at a minimum 75% of the way (either all the way on, or all the way off).

I know this sounds ridiculous, but this is just a small example of what I witness on a regular basis in this community.  Never have I delt with this in any other command, although I was previously in the Aviation community.  Maybe that has something to do with it.  But are we seriously turning into a service that has nothing better to do than to impose our own standards onto others and then pretend like it's part of the regs?

I am eager to know what you all think.  Thank you.

They need to stay until primary care is finished as well in case any work pops up. We have needed help and have seen that they aren't there, this is detrimental to our mission blah blah. They have said that they don't have enough time to get their job done that day, but this will give them an extra two hours a week. Let your people know.

I work in a department, by myself, with pretty set hours and a workload that I finish up at 1600 when the other departments WERE leaving every day, I have never once said there wasn't enough time to get a job done that same day so I have no idea where that comment came from. My LPO came to talk to me and told me ""this is fucking stupid, but they want you to stay until Primary Care is done too, even though there is nothing they need from you once everyone is checked in. It's not coming from me, its from LT makeslifehard.""

Now 30 minutes isn't a big deal, but it's never 30 minutes. Doctors run behind, people need to get ""re-educated"" and nobody can leave if those are occuring for the hell department. Since they suffer, we all suffer now. Here's how it usually ends up:

Me at 1600: Need anything from me? 
Them: Hold on let me find out *disappears for 20 minutes*
Them: Nope, you're all set, we were done at 1550. 
Me: *sigh*

Only 20 more days of this bullshit until I PCS, but jesus christ this has been an awful command. I am guessing all shore duty is like this and I would rather forever be deployed than put up with Navy boredom politics again.


EDIT: Hell, I forgot to mention even more bullshit we have to do every day (except for ""mando"" PT on monday and friday). We have to muster at 0715 every morning, which in itself isn't a big deal, you have musters and formations everywhere, except for this muster three people have to come to the front of the group and one person states what happened that day in Naval history, one person recites a naval term and one person will talk about a medal of honor winner. We have been doing this for nearly 5 months now, there are no more fucking terms or MoH winners we haven't already discussed so we just repeat the same shit over and over. It's really pointless and while the Chief who makes us do it says that knowing is the entire battle or some shit, he just does it so people aren't late. That's fine, form us up at 0715 but don't make us do elementary school presentations in front of the class to put a purpose behind it.

As I said, this is for science fiction, but I imagine that the principles involved would be pretty similar.

I want to be a little more grounded in reality than Captain Kirk and Commander Shepard, so I would like to know what the day of a typical XO, for example, would involve.

First of all, i'd like to state that I in no way want to talk up or down to any other command mentioned in this rant, just boast about what I love most: RIVRON.

So, since i've been in the Navy, i've been on a DDG for 3 years, and spent 7 years at RIVRON.  I was there for Iraq, twice.  I've been through every training cycle imaginable, and have every qualification this command offers enlisted side.  I've shot every weapon on the boat, and been in combat next to SEALs, CASEVAC'd marines, done ground patrols, convoys, and even loaded the latest craft into another vessel and deployed from that ship.  Every step of training along the way is done with enlisted side by side with their officers.  School of Infantry?  Yup.  RCS?  Yep.  RST?  You got it.  When we are in traditional naval environments, our Chiefs and Officers catch a lot of hell, because they don't eat in the Chief's mess, they don't attend wardroom functions, they eat and play with the enlisted.  The respect is always there, and even moreso -- there's comradery.  Every detachment functions as a single entity, and it's exciting.

Also, you're an Enginemen?  Good, go learn about guns.  You're a Gunnersmate?  That's neat, go learn about Intel.  Intel weeny?  Get in touch with the enginemen.  Every single person learns every single trade after mastering their own.  No, an Enginemen can't wholely replace an ET, but they sure as hell can program the radios for the next guy!

Back to the point, we're being merged with MESF, or MESRON -- the harbor patrol/embarked security team element, and it saddens me.  We're moving from a pipeline that was created and carried on by Marines into a true blue water construct.  We will likely maintain a very small brown water presence.  We've already accepted that we will no longer be able to do 10 hour hikes just to ensure our kits fit properly, that everything is silent as we move, getting a quality pace count, and adjusting all of our added gear as our ""work day"".  Our mission has changed.

We welcome the change, and our new brothers... but it's a long road ahead - one that I'm not sure any of us expected.",,False,self,t5_2rg06,False,,,True,t3_15lbfs,http://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/15lbfs/goodbye_riverines_my_short_and_loving_parting/,

I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/n4in5/creating_a_program_to_help_fellow_future_sailors/) last month about this study program I've been working on, and I finally have it at a ""finished"" state. I will continue to add more to it up until I ship (March 12th) but I believe with as much information it has now it will be a good help for fellow future sailors looking to learn the information quickly.

It's main focus is to help future sailors learn what they need to know before they get to RTC. After seeing many people struggle to learn the material in DEP meetings I thought something like this would be helpful, and especially useful for those who have a hard time memorizing information by just reading it out of a S.T.A.R.T. book. It has interactive study pages, questions, quizzes, and games for the different subjects. You can also choose an amount of time to study for, and it will keep track of it for you.

To preface, I did search, so please no flaming.
I am currently enrolled in STA21 in the nuke option, being a prior nuke.  I've always wanted to be a seal and there were no avenues to cross rate as enlisted.  Now I feel I might have a chance to do so as an officer and am hoping one of you can tell me how.  I'm open to any solution, and just so you know I am completely committed to fulfilling my contract as a nuke, just wanting to explore my options.  I will be 26 when I earn my commission and incur a five year commitment to the nuclear community.  The age limit for a seal officer seams to be waiverable up to 30, though in the fy13 sta 21 fleet brief it says 35 is the upper limit under extreme cases.  Thanks so much in advance.

TL;DR How do I go from a Nuke Officer to Seal?",,False,self,t5_2rg06,False,,,True,t3_18skxr,http://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/18skxr/nuke_to_seal/,

He is planning to move out to where I am as soon as he can but he is stuck where he was stationed and here is the reason - he says that he can't get household goods until he has his final orders (DD-214 I think). Well my chief told me today that discharge papers should be enough to get household goods going. I told my fiancee that and he said that he can't even get discharge papers until he gets his final orders, all he has are his checkout sheets which aren't enough for household goods. So I asked him, since he doesn't have his discharge papers, is he still getting paid for this time he is stuck there waiting on his paperwork? And he said no. So does anyone know why this would be playing out this way and is there anything either of us can do to get this taken care of?

UPDATE: So, I called his command's admin this morning, and asked what was going on. The guy there told me the same thing, that it might come in this week, let's wait and see ect. I said Ok, thank you and hung up, but then I thought, well that's not really acceptable that it MIGHT come in this week when it should be in already. So I called the guy back and asked him WHY it's taking so long. 20 minutes later the orders were ready to be picked up! So yeah, I think this was a case of people not wanting to do their job.

Hey everyone. I've been eagerly researching the military for nearly two years, and after a year of preparing an OCS package, I received my pro-rec this morning for all three designators I applied for.

Here are some of my details so you can get an idea of what got me accepted:

* I am a 24-year-old male.
* I am a journalism major with a 3.85 GPA. My package was submitted in November, but I actually didn't finish my coursework until this week. I went to California State University, Northridge, which isn't a competitive/stellar college. (EDIT: I mean, I loved the college and had a ton of difficult coursework. I am not knocking the quality of the college, but I guess people tend to care about the esteem associated with name/history/price tag/exclusivity and whatnot, and I know CSUN doesn't rank in that regard)
* I took the ASTB and scored a 6/7/7 55. It's not a horrible score, but it's not as high as I wanted it to be.
* I have no athletic experience/club leadership/etc. However, I spent a tremendous amount of time as a leader on college newspapers, with a couple years spent in editor positions that included editor-in-chief.
* I have four years of work experience in offices, and I got four great letters of recommendation: two from my college advisers, two from work contacts.
* I have a half-sleeve tattoo on my right arm that required a waiver because it cannot be properly covered with PT gear.
* I wrote a balls good motivational statement, if I do say so myself (and I do).

If I think of anything else that may have assisted the decision to pro-rec me, I'll add it here. **The bottom line is this:** If you are considering Navy Officer Candidate School, do your research and talk to your officer recruiter. Don't give up hope because somebody told you that your degree is worthless. There's a lot more to it than that.

-------------

**EDIT:** AlwaysInconsolable brings up a good point: Just because you have a degree does not mean you should feel obligated to pursue being an officer. There are pros and cons for officers and enlisted alike. You should be concerned with what *you* want to be doing and how you can best do that thing. To that end, I really recommend researching and gathering information from both sides. There is plenty of useful information on the Interwebz, even if you may need to dig through bias and bitterness to get there.",,False,self,t5_2rg06,1355446072.0,,,True,t3_14srqy,http://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/14srqy/liberal_arts_major_here_i_was_prorecced_this/,

Does anyone else really hate their shop? Like dread going into work every day, be completely miserable at work, feel like you're going to break down?

It's not like the stress of the job itself getting to me. I'm in a repair technician kind of shop, and I'm pretty decent at fixing gear, I think. I've been in the shop for around 3 - 4 months now, and I've never received any training when it comes to...anything. Today is the first time I've received any sort of training at all, and it lasted 30 minutes. 

I'm just really lost on everything and every time I ask a question about anything my supervisor gets this tone with me which sounds like I'm a complete dumbass for asking about something I didn't know. And every time I mess something up I get chewed out by 2 or 3 second classes and a first class over it, even if its just me fucking up something minor That no one told me about. Which makes me feel like a complete idiot and makes me feel like I'm being a shitbag even though I try my hardest at work. An example quote: ""You're nowhere near as smart as you think you are.""

It's a PBS documentary on the USS Nimitz, about 10 or so episodes.

To those who have seen it, is it an accurate portrayal? The PBS crew can't obviously show everything and everyone so I'm wondering what they left out?

Also some general questions:

* The show interviews lots of enlisted men but also some officers. Officers seem to be wayyyy happier with their job the enlisted folk. It really seemed like 3/4 enlisted interviewees did not enjoy most parts of their jobs.
* When on liberty at Guam, an officer met up with his wife. She must have flown there. Is this common? In the next episode, the crew was stated to say that orders get changed often so they didn't know exactly where to go (was supposed to go to Korea, ended up going past Singapore instead). Seems hard to meet up with your wife if the ship doesn't have a set course.
* I cannot comprehend 5,000 people on one ship. Can anyone delve into this?
* How hard is it to maintain contact with loved ones? One enlisted person said no phones or emails were allowed.
* The documentary came out in 2008, shot in I think 2005 or so. This was before the blue digital camouflage, correct? The documentary had tons of different uniforms. Do all seamen wear the NWU now on ships?

I'm currently separated living in one city with the kids, while ex lives in another city. 

The ex and my mother have both volunteered to care for them and have custody while doing so.

I was advised by my recruiter to join first as married and then file for divorce once I'm in.

His reasoning was that it'd be easier to get in that way, and that it is difficult getting in with three dependents at my age.

He also said based on our conversation my wife and I may still get back together (I seriously doubt that).

We have not filed for legal separation or anything and still have a pretty amicable relationship.

What do you guys think? Am I making a huge mistake if I DEP in with the possibility of divorce? Wouldn't she get all sorts of money out of me that way?

I just thought of asking Reddit this, so it's a little late. Anyways, I am in ROTC and I ship select tomorrow...

They start by calling up the #1 person, who tell the detailer what they want, and they say congrats etc and go on down the list. 

I have basically settled on a Destroyer, but am trying to decide on a specific one as well as which homeport I want. My top choices are (in order as of right now) 1) Pearl Harbor, HI, 2) San Diego, CA, 3) Mayport, FL.

Any advice/ info on living in these places/tips/ opinions would be greatly appreciated! 

P.S. I'm a SWO (N), so I am sort of leaning away from San Diego just because I can get stationed there for my carrier tour **(Does anyone know the odds of getting what you want for your carrier tour??)

I think this might not be the best one to start with as it involves knowing a bit about arresting gear. But it's what I was thinking about this morning. So here it is - it's a touch long so I'll give the tl;dr - created rather massive clang and bent some really thick steal, then learned to trust my work center supervisor.

When: 1989

Where: USS Carl Vinson - Alameda (in port)

What: Fluid transfer out of number 3 arresting gear engine

Why: Maintenance on MEC

This is technical - maybe not appropriate but I thought I'd give it a stab.

We were at our home port in Alameda and I had duty on a Saturday. I was an E-3 Aviation Boatswain Mate Equipmentman working in the arresting gear shop of the V-2 division. I'd been left a pretty simple job to do, transfering hydraulic fluid out of an arresting gear engine and into the main storage tank. It was the number 3 arresting gear engine. We'd already dereaved it (removed all the cables) and we were going to repack the MEC before we put everything back together. Getting the fluid out would just remove one more step before we started the real work on Monday.

I have a 3rd class with me that day, but he really didn't know a whole lot about how things worked with the engine. He spent most of his time top-side and knew that area better. So I was in charge of what we were doing. We'd tagged stuff out and it wasn't exactly rocket science.

An arresting gear engine has two pistons, one is in a cylinder on top and it floats between the fluid side and an air side. The bottom piston is the one that goes into the main engine cylinder. The engine itself is attached to pipes that connect it to the large storage tank. All it takes to move fluid from one to the other is opening the right valves and making sure there is higher pressure in the place you want fluid to leave and lower pressure in the place you want fluid to go.

In our case, this meant putting some air pressure behind the floating cylinder and then letting it push the fluid out, through the lines and into the tank. No biggie.

The MEC needed to be repacked because it had totally blown out on our last trip. We had stripped the 3 wire with it stroked in and it was sitting that way still, crosshead in and no wire on it at all.

I let some ships hp air feed into the engine and opened things up - but no fluid was moving. That seemed odd, but the easiest way to fix that, I thought, was to go ahead and add more pressure. Pretty soon I had that thing up nice and high (don't remember the exact number any more but it was way higher than it should have taken) and still, the fluid was not moving.

That's when it hit me. The retract valve was closed and keeping the fluid from moving out of the accumulator. I turned to PO3 Jackson and said - ""Hey, why don't you run back to deck edge and open up the retract valve?"" It was tagged out but we needed it open and you know- gotta get it done. He said ""O.k."" and took off.

From the engine room to deck-edge was a little ways, and shortly after he was gone, it hit me. The retract valve would allow the fluid to move back down - not just to the little pipe we wanted it to move through but also down into the MEC and when it got there that crosshead was going to move. As this all came together in my brain I started to run out of the engine room to see if I could catch Jackson, that's also just when he opened the valve.

All that pressure slammed the piston out of the MEC like a giant hydraulic hammer. The entire engine is encased in a frame made of steel i-beams. Picture the stuff sky scrapers are made off. That crosshead hit the back so hard it bent the entire beam. It was a sound I'll never forget, it went right through me. I was shaking and so thankful nobody got hurt and I had no idea if there was more damage to the engine.

We got the fluid transferred and called it done for the day.

The next morning I left the boat early. My PO-1 who ran the shop was on duty on the brow. I asked him for permission to leave and took off with a cold feeling in my gut. Figured I'd enjoy some time off the boat in case I didn't get any again for a while.

When I came back that night he found me in the berthing and said, ""How'd you just leave the boat with a straight face like that, knowing what you did?"" I said, ""Well, I didn't know how it would go down and figured I'd better take off.""

He was more mad at that than the accident. We took care of that quietly and I learned to trust him. He worked us like dogs, worked as hard or harder himself and always, always took care of his guys. (Barring the dirt bags of course.)

Here's a photo of a couple arresting gear engines - you can see what the frames are like by looking at what the operator is sitting on.

I leave from LA and I've enlisted as a HM. I had to face apt to be able to enlist but what I learned before enlisting and during my time in the DEP is a lot. 

I learned that if I really want something, I have to show the initiative. With some pass troubles with Marine recruiters (if anyone is interested, basically I enlisted with the Marines twice but due to miscommunication and being told to lie, I had two DEP discharges) I pretty much had to plead my case on why I should enlist into the Navy. Guess what happened. 

I learned to become more confident with myself which is something I never really had much of. Hell, even learning the general orders, rank structure, and Sailors Creed helped me to stop being so lazy and focus.

I'm sure you have a lot of questions and concerns. I'm going to attempt to compile a guide/FAQ for anyone interested in enlisting as or cross-rating to the HM rating. I welcome any fellow HM's to add your experiences. 

About me, I've been in the Navy for 4.5 years. I'm an HM2, I went to corps school in Great Lakes, followed by Field Medical Training Battalion (FMTB) in Camp Lejeune. After that I spent 2 years in Groton, CT as a quad zero (nec 0000) and became interested in the lab. After that I attended Laboratory Technician ""C"" school in San Antonio, TX. I got to see the opening of Corpsman Basic in San Antonio and I know quite a few instructors from my previous commands. Now I'm in Charleston, SC working in the lab.

On to the questions:

Q: What the hell is a corpsman anyways?

A: A corpsman is any enlisted medical personnel in the Navy. If you want to do anything medical wise in the Navy, then a corpsman is where you start. There is a staggering amount of different individual jobs that a corpsman can do. This ranges from managing medical records to being embedded with a Marine unit as their corpsman. Some very well trained corpsman can become Independent Duty Corpsman, which means that they don't need a doctor directly over them.

Q: Ok, that sounds cool, where might I be stationed?

A: Corpsman are able to be stationed anywhere that has a Navy or Marine Corps presence. There are many different places and platforms. Hospitals, clinics, aircraft carriers, submarines, squadrons, Marine divisions, the list goes on and on. Also, as we become more of a ""joint"" military corpsman are getting stationed with the Airforce and Army. 

Q: The Marine Corps? I thought I was joining the Navy!

A: Yes, the Navy actually provides ALL medical services for the Marines. Our doctors, nurses and corpsman are stationed directly with the marines. This is called the ""green side"". As a corpsman you will be their medic. You will train with them, eat with them, and go to war with them. While the draw downs have slowed deployments it is still very likely that you will go with the marines. Most young males go through FMTB after corps school. 

Q: How's advancement as a corpsman?

A: Since the HM rating is so large the competition can be fierce. As an active duty HM you will compete with every other HM in that rank regardless of specialty or duty station. However, as with most things, if you're motivated and study hard then making rake wont be an issue. Advancement rates rise and fall as time goes on but recently it's been better. 

Q: What are some of the specialties available to a corpsman?

A: There are 39 different specialties or Navy Enlisted Classification's (NEC's). These are communities withing the corpsman rating that require a ""C"" school. 

As of 2011 all entry level ""C"" schools are in San Antonio, TX. Since corps school is there also it's very easy for a new corpsman to pick up orders to a school.

It has a *ton* of ""flair"" on it (patch flag of Michigan, patch flag of Japan, etc.) as well as having my original IT3 crow and the UIM from my first command. I keep these on there for nostalgia reasons.

A lieutenant and a master chief *walked up to me* while I was at a stop light and told me I couldn't wear that top with the uniform insignia still on it. I was polite and told them that they're no longer considered uniform items at all. Neither one of us were able to produce documentation or cite instructions that prove either story. Admittedly, I have never seen such documentation. I was simply wearing it with the approval of *my* chain of command. Either way, they didn't give me too much hassle about it and left.

I was stopped at the gate by an MA2 last week who said the same thing and still let me wear it. I informed my chief and my divo who both thought I was in the right, but said since this was the second time it happened they would do some research to be sure.

I've researched and they've researched and none of us have been able to find anything.

Perhaps someone else has been down this path and found the official word?

**EDIT:** The UIM is still used in dress blues and dress whites. I completely forgot all about that.

However, the service blue rate patch isn't used in *anything* anymore and is, in fact, not a uniform item so it's fine. The rate and rank insignia themselves are not disqualifying items; [these shirts](http://www.medalsofamerica.com/Item--i-TC1279_STYLE) and many others with much more brazen displays are sold *in the NEX* (here and in Yokoksuka, at least) and are authorized for wear.

Our CMC came and talked to us less than a week ago about professionalism and respect.  

I guess what I'm asking here is, is the stuff about pride and professionalism and respect just some meaningless mantra the upper chain of command repeat to us over and over to look good and the real Navy is just full of people who dont give a damn?  Or am I just viewing this all wrong?

Originally I wished to join SEALs due to it's intensity, challenge and a reason to prove myself. An old acquaintance of mine had a few friends who were SEALs that I barely kept in contact with (hardly at all) and they never regretted their decision.

http://www.airbase.ru/cache/hangar/planes/usa/f/f-14/pix//1024x768/f14tu95.jpg

Where: Somewhere in the Pacific not far from Russia

When: 1989

Why: Keep the sea lanes open and such

What: Tag with Russian aircraft

After my first WESPAC was done in December of '88. We did some different stuff through the first half of '89 (workups, taking out RAG squadrons, sea trials, etc.). Then in September of '89 we headed out for PACEX '89. It was the largest peacetime naval exercise since WWII. We had 3 carrier groups, and did some stuff involving the air force and foreign militaries. We spent a lot of time up around the Aleutian islands. It was frigging cold. The seas were choppy and it was just nasty up there. I did get to see something pretty cool though, B-1s doing some high speed maneuvers up there. (Years later I was at an airshow and they had paintings of a B-1 flying low over the water, with water being thrown up in the bomber's wake. They guy their told me the painting was inspired by flying he saw done during that exercise.)

With the cold weather, being out on the flight deck was not a lot of fun. We would wrap rags around our face, below our goggles, our cranials covered the back of our head. Back in the gear we had a fork lift that we kept parked back by the hatch down to the barricade storeroom. We would run it and stand around the warm exhaust. I'm sure I lost more than a few brain cells getting warm that way.

I still felt bad for the guys on the small boys. I believe our plane gaurd at the time was the USS Arkansas. When we were bobbing up and down I could look off and see her just plunging through the waves. If it moves a carrier around--you know a cruiser is having a wild ride. This was nothing though compared to a storm we would get into on our way back from Korea at the end of the exercise.

Operating in the Aleutians was interesting. The little islands were all over and we were cruising around in them. For flight ops you have to keep a minimum of 30 knotts of wind across the deck- that's launch and recovery. So usually you just turn into the wind and cruise in that direction to help out. In the islands we were constantly turning as islands would get in our way. (an interesting note-- top speed on a nimitz class carrier is classified, I don't know what it is, but I do know this-- we more than once maintained that 30 knotts across the deck going with the wind rather than against it. Those big boats can get up and move.)

We worked our tails off. The big brass had us throwing up all kinds of packages constantly. We moved from event to event with very little down time for maintenance. With a full air group-- V-2 can get worked hard without even pushing the squadrons too much. I'm sure the pilots were working hard-- but we had to be at it regardless of who was in the air, whereas they just worked their part of it. Anyway- after a while we swung out and down to Asia. I think a big part of this whole thing was to project capability to the Russians. And as we moved closer to the USSR- we started to interact with them on a regular basis.

We had ramped up to alert five early on and we would play games. The Soviets would send out Bear and Badger bombers. We would launch alert fives and other fighters to escort them. We would also put up our own full packages with the E-2s and other aircraft (EA-6B, A-6, S-3, A-7 and SH-60F). The guys in combat control would pick up inbound aircraft and then they would call away the launch on the 1-MC. For an alert 5 they would give the initial vector of the aircraft when they called it away. I think this was to get the ship headed the way they would go to save time- but I'm not sure.

Much like when we were up in the gulf this got old fast. Especially here when we knew there would be no shooting. When we were at alert 5 status we had to be manned up constantly. We slept on the deck and they brought us our meals in boxes. And every so often the 1MC would call out- ""Now launch the alert 5 figher. Initial vector One Two Three"" or something on that order. And sometimes a little while later we would get a glimpse of a Russian bomber being shadowed by one or two of our Tomcats. One sunny afternoon I heard something extremely unique- and I doubt it has happened too often- I would think this might be the only time. It was (and this is verbatim) - ""Now launch the alert 5 fighter. Initial vector overhead."" We stopped, looked up, and way up there was a Bear bomber cruising around without an escort.

I don't know how it happened or what the aftermath was. Rumors were some officer in CC got busted pretty hard-- but I have no idea how true that was. It was pretty wild though. Basically we were caught with our pants down in a big way.

My question for you guys is, did I just get totally fucked? My recruiter's been pretty straight with me since I met him, but something about this just doesn't sit right with me. So, should I have my contract changed before I ship out, or should I just go on ahead to basic as is?

Anything I need to know about recruitment? I have no criminal history, an excellent driving record and am in fairly good shape other than the little pot belly I'm working on now. The recruiter mentioned something about working in Intelligence and looking at Officer School after I'm enlisted for a year or so. Is that a real possibility or was he blowing smoke up my ass?

When he suggested SWO, he explained that after about 18 months, I could request to enter EOD and would have a better chance at doing so than as a civilian anyway. Does any one know how often this is allowed for officers or has anyone out there actually done this? What was the process like? Was it a nightmare or fairly painless as an officer?

Luckily though, thanks to No-Coast-Punk, I looked a little deeper into AECF, and decided I'd like to give it a try.  They told me I was eligible and that they had one opening left so I took it.  I was sworn in, and I ship off to basic training on October 1st.  Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for all the helpful feedback and advice.

1. Is volunteer service a big deal while in the Navy? Especially as a very junior enlisted sailor?

2. IS it something I should continue with and keep getting the 100 hours signed off on? Every time I complete a hundred hours do I add a star or something to the ribbon? (such as the NAM)

3. Are there good volunteer opportunities for someone going overseas for their first command? I love volunteering and have done 175 hours through A and C school and would like the trend to continue while I am overseas.

I'm picking my orders soon because of graduating C-School and I was considering taking Japan if it's available. I know you can make a lot more over there especially after you make E4/E5, which I make E4 automatically after December. I was wondering if anyone can tell me if the money is good over there as an ENobody, I'm currently working to pay down my debt and I'd like to be debt free when I finish my first contract. ~32k in debt currently. Any stories? Insight on how much you can make over there? Is it truly as much as everyone makes it seem? An extra 400-500 dollars a month after that E4 pay and whatever you get over there would definitely decrease my debt quick.

To get to the point, I have had my degree and decided to do enlisted before officer (recruiter told me that my 3.0 was acceptable but probably not competitive). So I came in around a year and a half ago and now I'm an IT3. I'm on a very small ship (PC) and the command is very tight. I've been talking to my CO and XO about going to OCS since I arrived and they've been very supportive of the idea the whole way through.

Having just obtained my ESWS pin, I've been told now would probably be the best time for me to submit my package.

Do any of you have experience with this? Can you help me out? I've been filling out the 1420/1 but I'm a little unsure of how to go about it. I've heard a lot about using 'buzz words' and phrases in the boxes where you explain your reasons and the core values, but haven't heard what those words and phrases may be.

A little about what I've done in my short time in the Navy: serve as 1 of 2 IT's on my crew, became assistant PAO upon joining the crew and the actual PAO just a month later, serve as one of three CICWO's when we're underway.

My degree is in Communication, I graduated with a 3.0, and I'd like to get into the PAO, Information Specialist, or Information Warfare designations. I was the managing editor of the school paper and managed about 25 writers/photographers.

Well the most important question for me is if I should volunteer for the leadership position when they ask for volunteers. I know you all said that it's good because it gets you out of a lot of shit but it also puts you into a lot of it. 

I was in NJROTC in high school and was a PC my junior year. That same year I won Honor Platoon. I know that I am a good leader and I can direct and teach. My senior year I was the battalion XO so I KNOW what kind of responsibility I am looking at and I know how hot goes down. Being the XO I had to be a dick to get things done. I wasn't a dick just because I could I only did when I needed to get shit done and that was the only thing that would beat into there head. With all that being said here is my problem. Also tho already means I'm an e3 so promotion is not motivating me at all because you can't go past e3 in basic.

I love leading and I know I can lead successfully on bootcamp. So that's not the problem. But before I knew you could et jobs in basic I was literally just going to be a ghost and mind my own business. 

So I'm asking if it's really worth being the leader in basic? Do you all wish you volunteered for it? It's not a matter of IF I can because I know I could it's just a matter of I don't want more attention then I really need. If its better to just stick in the back then that's all fine an dandies but if being the leader is what would make things go smoother and more enjoyable then I don't mind that.

Keep in mind that I don't have the whole (I want to get by doing as little as possible attitude) its just that I don't want any more attention then I have to put up with in bootcamp. Outside of bootcamp leadership is what I need because I enjoy being over people. But during bootcamp the outcome will be the same in 8 weeks worthier or not I volunteer to be the leader. So should I do it or not?

Sorry if this was confusing. If you need me to clarify anything just ask me. Thank you for your time.",,False,self,t5_2rg06,False,,,True,t3_vjslg,http://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/vjslg/help_with_a_few_very_important_questions_before_i/,

I have questions.,zephyr_,13,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/1fjilc/wanting_to_switch_from_the_coast_guard_to_the/,"Hello all! Like I said, I'm in the CG as a reservist and I want to switch over to active duty in the Navy. I've talked to people on the online Navy chat on the Navy website and each time they told me I could do that as long as I filled out a form for the CG to release me, and if I met with a navy recruiter. I have called one office in my city and a recruiter told me it wasn't possible. He was not helpful, at all, and he was very unprofessional.                                                          
An old shipmate from my CG unit switched over to the Navy a few months ago. So that's why I believe it to be possible.                        
Does anyone know if it is possible? Or what I should do about being told different answers? I plan on making an appointment with a recruiter this week but I'm afraid I'll get stuck with a recruiter who doesn't want to help. So I want to be prepared.

My nephew and I talked to a Navy recruiter today. He really wants to do Navy IT. I'm former Army so I thought this should be an easy request. Well, I was in for a bit of a surprise. The recruiter told me that there is really high demand for Navy positions right now. He told me that when my nephew goes to MEPS he will be offered a few different positions based on his ASVAB scores, and that he had to pick and accept one that day. There was no way of knowing in advance which position he'd be offered. If he wasn't willing to do this then the recruiter wasn't willing to work with him.

This seems like a crazy system. When I joined I got to pick my MOS and I got it in writing on my contract. It was a very easy process. It seems almost insane to force someone to pick a job on the spot with little advance notice. Is this how it really is? Is there any way to increase his chances of getting IT?

On [moneybadger's suggestion](http://www.reddit.com/r/navy/comments/r3gv9/directly_entering_ocs/c42ljmm), here is a quick guide to those considering Navy OCS.  Feel free to comment or add suggestions so that this might be as useful as possible.
___
So you have a Bachelor's degree and you want to join the Navy?  Great!

You have exactly **two** options:

* **Try for Officer Candidate School**.  Getting into OCS requires testing, a formal interview, and multiple letters of recommendation.  GPA and leadership experience will be considered.  You must be eligible for a security clearance and meet a number of other requirements beyond what's required to enlist.  The Navy holds OCS review boards for the different communities (SWO, Intel, etc.) irregularly and sometimes only once a year.  It could be a year or more before you get an answer and then the acceptance rates are still quite low (~10%).  With a few exceptions the Academy and ROTC boys get first choice on assignments within those communities, so you'll go where Uncle Sam needs you.  Officer pay, prestige (and most would say the ""lifestyle"") is better, but officers must lead other men and take on managerial responsibility.  If this interests you, speak with an *Officer* Recruiter (Enlisted Recruiters have an incentive to get you to enlist).  Be aware that Officer Recruiters can seem aloof or disinterested because you need them much more than they need you.

* **Enlist**.  Enlisting only requires a high school diploma, but your college degree will get you a small pay bump when you get out of boot camp.  There are fewer bureaucratic hoops to jump through and you'll probably have some more control over where you go and what you do.  Lots of people enlist at 18 or 19, and you'll be treated no better than them.  Some college grads find this irritating or even insulting, but that's the military.  After some time it is possible to apply for OCS from within the enlisted community, but your acceptance is far from guaranteed; even if things go perfectly you'll still need to go through the OCS wringer as described above.

Since this post isn't asking for advice about fields, rates, etc. I felt it didn't belong in r/newtothenavy. It's more like a survey, I guess.

I went in to my recruiting department basically saying ""Nuke or nothing"" after having looked into it extensively despite knowing it was pretty hated (funny thing is I didn't even know about all the bonuses yet at this point).  
 * Did you or any of your peers do this? Do they regret their decision now?

Next questions are for all Nukes 
 * What grades did you get in the schools? 
 * What rate did you want? What did you get? 
 * (MMs) - Welder / ELT? Why did(n't) you do one of these? 
 * Plan to retire or get out sooner? What did you plan before boot camp? How many years have you been in? 
 * 1 - 10 : How likely are you to push others towards Nuke?

For Subs (where I've wanted to be for years) 
 * How long did it take you to get your dolphins? 
 * How did it feel to wear them for the first time?

He is being bullied by a first class (he's a 3rd class) for not being religious, as he changed his listed religion. He changed it from Christian - Nondenominational to Agnostic and it caused a stir with the first class, who then proceeded to tell everyone in the command that he's not religious and he's a heathen. He has been shit on for being on ADD medication. They mock his dedication to his family and his wife. He has two young children and his family is frugal, and he's been relentlessly harped on for bringing in leftovers or sandwiches for lunch. His chief and command CO have been in the room for the mockery and bullying and have laughed along with it.

He was told that he doesn't fit in the command environment and that they want to move him, and he said that since he's been bullied for the last 2 and a half years that he completely agrees... Now they're refusing to move him. He also says that nobody will sign off on letting him use tuition assistance so he can better himself.

He's being a coward, not doing anything about it. I've told him to talk to the chaplain, or to someone even higher in his chain of command... He says he doesn't want to make waves. But if he doesn't do something, he's going to be miserable and he's going to ruin his career. He doesn't listen to the advice I give (Navy brat/wife/veteran) and certainly won't listen to his wife. Is there something concrete I can give him or tell him?

(Note: we've told him that the first step is telling these people to stop it as soon as the BS starts, but he gets flustered and kind of stutters when stressed out. He's told the people more than once while they aren't actively being asssholes that he doesn't appreciate it and they need to behave like adults and coworkers even if they aren't friends, but they just brush him off.)

Edit: He spoke to the chaplain today, and Chaplain was NOT pleased to hear what has been going on. If things aren't straightened up by the end of the holiday week they'll work on getting him into a better situation with a fresh start. One of the second classes in his squadron confirmed everything that my friend has said. He's more positive and enthusiastic about his career today than he has been since I've known him.

Just made second class and I'm a very indecisive person. I've changed my mind a bunch of times on what I want to do with my life and my career in the Navy. I don't have long to decide because my window for orders starts this cycle in June. My CCC recommended that I wait to see the orders and decide then whether I stilll want to fully submit my conversion package.

My EAOS is October 2015. As I mentioned, I have a package being routed up for a lateral conversion and the requirement would be three years upon completion of the A-school. If my package gets accepted, I estimate that I would graduate around September 2014 so I would not get out until September 2017 at the earliest.

Without a doubt, I want to go to university when I finish with the Navy and I'm 100% sure the military is **not** something I will make a career out of. I'm just afraid of going to uni when I'm 27 or 28 years old. I'll be so behind everyone else who went straight from high school. I don't want to be JUST graduating with a bachelors/masters when I'm over 30. Another thing playing a factor is a girl back home. I know it's the worst thing for a man's career to base his life around someone else, but it'll always be in the back of my mind and have some kind of effect on my decision.

Anyways, does anyone have any success/depress stories? Any advice, things to think about, who I should talk to? Someone told me to make a pros/cons list which I'm going to do tonight. 

**TL;DR**: I can get out in 2015 if I stay my rate or 2017 if my conversion package gets submitted and approved. University is a must for me when I get out. Scared of going to uni too late. Girl back home. Lost and confused. Tell me your success/depress stories.

We had a new sailor come in after he had finished A-school to answer some questions at a DEP meeting we had.

Now needles haven't ever been my favorite thing, but I got over it for the most part. I just really don't like them inside my mouth.

* Mine are not breached at all. Does this have any influence on whether they take them out? Does it have any influence on whether they sedate me or not?

* I'm not going to be on a sub and am very unlikely to be on a ship with my job. Again, make any difference?

* I know that I can't just get a note from my dentist or whatever, but he did say he didn't see any problems with them, and I haven't yet had any problems with them. So my question is; do they ever decide that you don't need them out if *they* feel that it's not necessary?
