1370473361.0,3574,self.asoiaf,1fr588,(Spoilers All) A dwarf's perspective on Tyrion Lannister.,FaceofMoe,7751,4177,684,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fr588/spoilers_all_a_dwarfs_perspective_on_tyrion/,"A few years ago I was out to coffee with my mother. We each brought a book as we usually do, and I was diving into a fantasy novel recommended by a friend. I read for a while, thoroughly  engaged until I stopped abruptly. *Well Shit* A dwarf character. This did not bode well. I’m a dwarf, to be more specific I’m a picky, cantankerous dwarf. I’ve read dozens of books that tackle disabled characters, most of which were laughably terrible at capturing our experience. Some chose to fetishize the disability, contorting the character into some barely recognizable stereotype. Others de-emphasize the disability to the point that it may as well be hair color, some irrelevant trait of little interest. Neither does justice to the dwarf experience. So, when I discovered Tyrion I proceeded with trepidation, a hesitancy which lasted all of half a chapter. After only a few pages I realized I was reading perhaps the greatest, and most realistic disabled character I’ve ever read. 

Tyrion’s experience, his language, his perspective was so shockingly true that I was taken aback. Throughout the book, Tyrion deals with issues intimately familiar to dwarfs. He struggles with self-hate, frustration, humiliation, an intense desire to be loved, prevailing feelings of otherness. Tyrion demonstrates traits so often cultivated by the dwarf experience, wit and self-deprecation, an insatiable desire to fill a space with one’s personality. More than anything else, one line of advice in the series speaks to the most frustrating, sometimes heartbreaking aspect of life as a dwarf:

**Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.**
                                  Game of Thrones-Jon (I)

**The truth of it is this: To be a dwarf is to be burdened with certain preconceived cultural conceptions of dwarfism, making it in some ways a continual performance. ** This performance is in my experience unavoidable. The dwarf as a source of tragedy or comedy is a very, very old idea. Going back to the origins of modern drama with Commedia Dell Arte, the dwarf has served as a source of either comedic relief or poignant tragedy. The Italian play *Les Gobbi* in the 1500’s utilized a variety of dwarf actors, each serving as absurd caricatures of difference preconceived elements of the dwarf. The tropes are many and enduring. 

The dwarf as the sexual deviant, a conniving Imp driven by lusts and a gross desire to possess and destroy the beautiful. The dwarf as a tragic figure, god’s cruel jest, a pitiful creature who may find some semblance of revenge in the third act. The comic dwarf, the happy sprite who spreads cheer and lightens dramatic tensions, magical and sexless, perhaps offering some encouragement and inspiration as needed. These shallow dramatic conventions endure, and have seeped into the zeitgeist. In fact, these dramatic conventions are so well established people seem to expect to see them exhibited in real dwarfs, both in RL and in ASOIF. A dwarf can never just buy some socks, no act is neutral. A dwarf must either comically struggle in a mis-sized world, or buy socks as a heartbreaking testament to the unbreakable nature of the human spirit. The first seems more popular in Westeros, the latter the narrative of choice in RL.  Dwarfs, disabled people in general are never allowed an act of banality. Everything is either comic, tragic, or an inspiration, we are perpetual actors in narrative not of our making. We are continually cast in these roles, and in modern life we all seem to cope in different ways. (As opposed to what dwarfs did for most of history IE. Get eaten or thrown down a well.)

Some dwarfs ignore these tropes, instead living their lives simply as they would, with little concern to what others expect of them. Others still passionately hate these stereotypes, and try to living in opposition to them. They strive to break preconceived notions, to present a decidedly different idea of what being a dwarf means. Yet another sub-group takes a unique approach, the approach I have endorsed my whole life.

Tyrion knows his lot. He understands what being a dwarf means in his world. He has decided to embody these tropes, to accentuate the very real elements of comedy, tragedy and perversity which are inherent to the disable experience. He has adopted these roles, as protection in a world full to the brim with inhumanity. He becomes what others believe him to be, thus protecting the most vulnerable parts of himself. Tyrion is heart-breakingly lonely, profoundly unsatisfied with life, desperate to be seen as a full person. Yet as a kind of consolation, he has come to find some enjoyment in playing the motley fool, the perverse and lustful Imp, a fearless half-man of infinite wit. I think he even performs for himself, indulging in melodrama within his own internal monologue. (Ask “Where do whores go?” one more goddamned time…)

Now I’m no Tyrion. I’m obviously far less intelligent, if not slightly redeemed by my having a nose. We do share a great deal however. I too have found a kind of peace in embracing the roles others would force on me. If I am to be cast as the jester, then I shall play the role as best I can. There is a kind of refuge in embracing and transforming expectations, filling a role that is larger and older then yourself. Public attention and gawking is just a part of being a dwarf. It is far better than to yell “Look at me!”, command a room, and seize control of the moment. I’m intrinsically tragic, intrinsically comic, these are true element my life extended to their greatest extent. I can no more escape these roles then escape my disability.  I’ve tried to explore these expectations, and turn them to my advantage. Learning to play with this narrative, to inhabit all that comes with this role is deeply satisfying. It is appropriation of a sort. That I imagine is a part of the appeal for Tyrion. 

There is a form of liberation to be found in performance, even if it is in a role forced upon us. It is better to make people laugh then be laughed at, to attract attention by our words then our form. Agency is an infinitely valuable commodity, an all too rare thing for people with disabilities during any time. It allows for a transformation, a special kind of magic unique to being a dwarf. The world is our audience, paradoxically quick to listen intently to what we have to say, and just as quick to dismiss it. 

Every dwarf may be a bastard, but we are all equally the clown, the tragic foil, the monster, and yes the Imp. I feel as if I’ve inherited a unique role, passed down for centuries. An odd sort of inheritance I’ll grant you, but one that can be absurdly fun. So when I saw George R.R Martin’s take on the dwarf experience, I immediately placed him as one of the greatest writers of our time, possessing a unique creative empathy so central to this series.

Tyrion as a character has made me better understand being a dwarf, and come to more fully appreciate its unique value as an experience. He has taught me to better appreciate my gifts, and cultivate them.  For better or worse, my disability dominates who I am. I am a dwarf.  I’ll play the role as best as I am able, enjoy every capricious minute, and ride my dog into the sunset. 

**TL'DR: Tyrion is easily one of the best representations of the dwarf experience precisely because he acknowledges the roles others would place on him. His life becomes in essence a performance, transcending and transforming the tired tropes forced upon him by the ignorant.**

I think the book readers have far better memories than the TV show watchers. In the books, you're aware that Roose's line is clearly due to Jaime's telling him to send his regards.

In the show though, viewers have shorter memories and would just assume that Jaime was behind the killings. This would result in people hating a character who in future seasons is one of the ""good guys"" (if there's such a thing).

Also, the book readers have the benefit of seeing into Jaime's head. TV show viewers don't.

I was slightly upset that they altered the epic line, but it makes perfect sense.

Dragons plant no trees. Remember that. Remember who you are, what you were made to be. Remember your words.*

*Remember who you are, Daenerys. The dragons know. Do you?*

*Why did they give the dragon’s eggs to you? They should have been mine. If I'd had a dragon, I would have taught the world the meaning of our words.*

-The Dreams and Hallucinations of Daenerys Targaryen upon the Dothraki Sea at the end of A Dance With Dragons

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In many ways, the theme of A Dance With Dragons is self-discovery. Bran learns about his powers as a greenseer and a warg. Jon Snow discovers his ability to lead and rule and plot. Arya's plot hinges around her holding tight to her identity. Theon remembers his name. Cersei gets a lesson in humility. All of our leading characters make large leaps towards self-understanding and an acceptance of their identities.

For Daenerys Targaryen, this lesson comes late- in the very last non-epilogue chapter of the book, in fact. Throughout her character development so far, Daenerys has had some key phrases that are very telling about her understanding of herself: ""If I look back, I am lost."" ""I am the Mother of Dragons."" ""I am only a young girl."" But all of those things are lies, and in this last chapter, Daenerys is forced to confront those lies and comes to understand the truth about herself.

At the beginning of the chapter, our heroine is still in denial. She realizes that riding Drogon is the only time in her life that she's ever felt *whole*(her words), but insists to herself that she has more important responsibilities- she is a mother, after all:

&gt;It was time, though. A girl might spend her life at play, but she was a woman grown, a queen, a wife, a mother to thousands. Her children had need of her. Drogon had bent before the whip, and so must she. She had to don her crown again and return to her ebon bench and the arms of her noble husband.

This is, of course, delusion. Dragons don't bend before the whip, neither must the blood of the dragon. We'll return to that momentarily.

&gt;If I look back, I am lost.

So goes the internal monologue of Daenerys Targaryen for pages and pages. Yet, here, in the Dothraki Sea, she begins to look back. She remembers her time with Drogo, and then with Viserys, and it brings another memory: Quaithe's warning that to go forward, she must go back. *Remember who you are, Daenerys Targaryen. The dragons know. Do you?* Not yet. 

Then she dreams of her dead brother Viserys, and he tells her that she betrayed him, and that *he* would have taught the world the meaning of the Targaryen words, *Fire and Blood*. This is obviously untrue, Viserys was an incompetent fool who got the death that was coming to him. But Daenerys has this dream for a reason. She is awakening to her true self.

&gt;“I am the blood of the dragon,” she told the grass, aloud.

&gt;*Once,* the grass whispered back, *until you chained your dragons in the dark.*

&gt;“Drogon killed a little girl. Her name was … her name …” Dany could not recall the child’s name. That made her so sad that she would have cried if all her tears had not been burned away. “I will never have a little girl. I was the Mother of Dragons.”

&gt;*Aye,* the grass said, *but you turned against your children.*

Her name is Hazzea, and I know that because this is the first time Daenerys has forgotten it. Why would she forget a name that burns her with guilt?

After this forgetting, she comes to a realization:

&gt;Meereen was not her home, and never would be. It was a city of strange men with strange gods and stranger hair, of slavers wrapped in fringed tokars, where grace was earned through whoring, butchery was art, and dog was a delicacy. Meereen would always be the Harpy’s city, and Daenerys could not be a harpy.

And then the waking hallucination of Jorah Mormont tells her the same, that Meereen was never her home. Daenerys responds, ""I am alone and lost."" She looked back, now she is lost. But is it Daenerys Targaryen the Dragon who is lost, or is it the Mother?

&gt;*You took Meereen,* he told her, *yet still you lingered.* “To be a queen.”

&gt;*You are a queen,* her bear said. *In Westeros.* “It is such a long way,” she complained. “I was tired, Jorah. I was weary of war. I wanted to rest, to laugh, to plant trees and see them grow. I am only a young girl.”

&gt;*No. You are the blood of the dragon.* The whispering was growing fainter, as if Ser Jorah were falling farther behind. ***Dragons plant no trees. Remember that. Remember who you are, what you were made to be. Remember your words.***

&gt;**“Fire and Blood,”** Daenerys told the swaying grass.

Half a page later...

&gt;She called until her voice was hoarse … and Drogon came, snorting plumes of smoke. The grass bowed down before him. Dany leapt onto his back. **She stank of blood and sweat and fear, but none of that mattered. “To go forward I must go back,” she said.** Her bare legs tightened around the dragon’s neck. She kicked him, and Drogon threw himself into the sky. Her whip was gone, so she used her hands and feet and turned him north by east, the way the scout had gone. Drogon went willingly enough; perhaps he smelled the rider’s fear.

This is not the girl who killed her husband and walked into his funeral pyre. This isn't the young woman who frees slaves and plays ruler. This is a Dragon Queen, who knows her name and her words, and who can call and ride dragons without a whip, without a horn, without any assistance. This is the magic of Old Valyria, which always used either blood or fire(and Daenerys Targaryen is soaked in her own blood).

My conclusion is this: Daenerys, through her ordeal on the Dothraki Sea, has come to accept herself as what she truly is: the last Targaryen. Not the Mother of Dragons, not just a young girl, not a queen who must learn to rule. She is a Targaryen who *knows her words*, which is even more important than knowing her name.

I find the exquisite tragedy of it all particularly convincing, because IMO one thing Martin loves to do is write tragedies. ASOIAF is filled with examples of tragic decisions where people trying to do the ""right"" thing create terrible consequences.

A narrative below, followed by an exegesis of its tragic elements. *Speculations are in italics.* **Bold for emphasis of known facts.** Anything not in italics can be located in the text, I only cite where convenient.

-Aerys' reign begins. At first it shows much promise, but over time his dangerous paranoia becomes apparent. This becomes more dramatically pronounced following the defiance of Duskendale. This creates something of a constitutional crisis: in a feudal monarchy, how does one declare a reigning monarch incapable of rule? The options are not good, and many of them lead to more harm than good.

-*The elder statesmen of the realm - Hoster Tully, Rickard Stark, Jon Arryn, and even Tywin Lannister - begin preparing to protect themselves against their liege's instability and/or depose him for the good of the realm.* They plan a web of marriage alliances between their houses, bringing in a fifth house, Baratheon, by including the young Robert (who is ward to Jon Arryn). Robert Baratheon to Lyanna Stark. Brandan Stark to Catelyn Tully. Lysa Tully to Jaime Lannister. **These bethrothals, if realized, create a potent axis: Baratheon-Stark-Tully-Lannister.** *Arryn is the only one left out, but he is bound to the group (indeed, perhaps even its instigator) thanks to his wardship of Robert and Ned. At this point, other than realizing that they should prepare for the worst when it comes to Aerys, their plans are indistinct, and likely not unanimous.*

-*Concurrently, the senior leadership of the Kingsguard witnesses Aerys' growing madness and is also growing troubled.* At first, Rhaegar didn't want to believe that his father was incapable to rule, but in the end, even he saw that this was true (Barristan, ADWD). *Gerold Hightower, Oswell Whent, and Arthur Dayne, the closest friend of Prince Rhaegar, are among the confidants that convince him that he needs to do something about his father to preserve the dynasty.* 

-Kingsguard inner circle member Oswell Whent goes to his brother, the Lord of Harenhall, *and brings him into the plot.* **Shortly after Whent's visit, the Tourney of Harenhall is held.** In attendance are Stark, Lannister, Tully, Arryn, the KG inner circle, and Rhaegar. *This tourney will be an opportunity for the plotters to hash out the means through which they will achieve the emerging objective of their plot: broadly, something like a soft coup wherein a council is called so Rhaegar can be declared regent until his father dies of natural causes. How this is to be accomplished and presented to Aerys is still under discussion.* Aerys is not expected to attended because ever since Duskendale, he rarely left the capital. However, Varys tells Aerys that the tourney is just a pretext for Rhaegar to plot against him. (Barristan, ADWD) [As an aside, the way this is presented in Barristan's chapter, we are led to believe that this is just another example of Aerys being crazy - typical GRRM narrative misdirection.] Aerys makes a surprise appearance and in a surprise move, names Jaime Lannister to the Kingsguard, which is believed to be just a slight to Tywin but also *has a deeper effect of cutting Tywin out of the circle of plotters.* 

-*Varys' intervention throws a roadblock in their schemes, and also reinforces Aerys' violent paranoia.* Then, Rhaegar absconds with Lyanna, is incommunicado for a while, and all hell breaks loose. Brandon Stark goes to KL and threatens Rhaegar's life. Rickard is summoned to KL to answer for his son. KG Commander Gerold Hightower witnesses Aerys executing them both, but is not in KL for the inevitable violent aftermath (!!) because *his primary loyalty is to Rhaegar, not Aerys, and he has ridden off, along with other members of the KG ""inner circle"" to consult with Rhaegar.* That the **commander of the Kingsguard and two of its most respected/deadly members are not at the King's disposal** right when a war is breaking out tells you a lot about the dynamics of the court at the time.

-At this point, events have overtaken any plans that may have been made, marriage alliances need to be reconfigured, and two new lords - Robert and Ned - ignorant of any previous plans and with agendas of their own, are now in play. Any hope for a peaceful resolution to the Aerys crisis is now lost. Whether they wanted it or not, the plotters have created a fight to the death against the Targaryen dynasty. *Tywin stays out of it for now because things are far too unpredictable for his liking - this was not the carefully orchestrated fait accompli he was anticipating.*

-Rhaegar finally returns to the capital, and has no choice but to fight his erstwhile fellow schemers for the very survival of his dynasty, even though he knows that the whole thing only began from a reasonable cause. Meanwhile, even though it's a fight to the death for Aerys, the KG inner circle and Rhaegar's confidants are at the Tower of Joy, *again because they answer to Rhaegar, not Aerys.* As he's leaving KL, he tells Jaime Lannister - now a junior member of the KG that he means to convene a great council to set things right once the rebellion is suppressed. The only previous great council we know of was the one that crowned Aegon V king following the death and uncertain succession of his father, Maekar. **So the precedence is that great councils are called to settle matters of succession—and Rhaegar wants to call a new one.** Sadly, this was not to be...

--

**With that out of the way, these are the manifold tragedies of this whole situation:**

**Imagine you're Rhaegar.** You are loved by all, and you love your father in turn for all his faults. You don't want to hurt him, and you want to believe the best about him, even though as his heir any weakness of his actually makes you stronger. Nevertheless, he doesn't trust you and constantly suspects that you are plotting against him, which makes it all the more difficult for you to act against him because you don't want to contribute to his growing madness and want him to be at peace. 

Finally he goes so crazy - he even hurts your mother - that your friends convince you for the good of your realm not to look away any more. With a heavy heart, you agree to join a plot against your father to have him deposed and yourself declared regent. You probably hope this can be done in some way that allows your father to rule in name and salvage his pride while you exercise power as regent. Unfortunately, it's all too late, especially after you make an impulsive mistake out of love/lust/religious fanaticism. You end up dying in battle against the very people who were going to help you put the realm to rights, because circumstances have turned you into enemies.

**Now, imagine you're Aerys.** All your most powerful vassals are, contrary to established precedent, forming marriage alliances with each other. Combined, they have power that threatens your own. This is troubling in and of itself, but meanwhile, everyone likes your heir more than they like you, including the leadership of your personal bodyguard! That's right, the people who are responsible for protecting your life are all the confidants of the man who takes over should you die! 

And they call you paranoid?! It's not paranoia if they're actually out to get you - and they ARE actually out to get you! But no one believes you, and anything you do to act against the threats to your life is only taken by those around you as further evidence of your madness. What can you do? Crush the schemers? You tried - and they just called you mad and rose up against you. Do nothing? Your tried that - and the rebellion just got bigger. You're trapped in a situation where there's no possible way out. Everywhere, your subjects are fighting against you, their rightful king. There's only one thing you can do. Burn them. Burn them all.

[As an aside - playing Crusader Kings 2 really helped me understand Aerys' POV. If in that game my vassals were forming a marriage alliance superbloc at the same time that everyone loved my heir and hated me, I would be (1) finding pretexts to throw dangerous lords in the dungeon (2) having my Spymaster work overtime to ferret out plots and (3) seriously considering having someone assassinate my son. Just saying.]

**Now, imagine you're Jon Arryn.** You didn't want things to come to this. You hoped to find some way to get Aerys off the stage gracefully, peacefully, with minimal disruption to the realm. But there were a bunch of young hotheads involved - Brandon, Robert, and Rhaegar - and everything spun out of control. Now there's nothing left but to try and pick up the pieces. 

As Hand, you have no choice but to make the best of it and try to restitch together the realm that you yourself have helped to tear apart. You know that Westeros is weaker now for what you've done. The crowned stag does not command the same respect that the crowned dragons did. Already the Iron Islanders have rebelled once, and you're sure they will again. To try and keep the peace you've forced the boy you loved like a son into a loveless marriage, one you've just learned is an even bigger sham than you realized. There will be war, again. The realm will bleed, again. All because you tried to make things better by putting a son ahead of his father. And now you are dying, your work unfinished, what little peace you accomplished about to unravel, and even you do not know that in the North an ancient threat is stirring that only an united Westeros would have had a chance to defeat.

1. R+L=J is gospel. It's possible that it's the only true thing that has happened in the entire series. If GRRM writes anything different, he did it wrong.

2. Not only are there Bolton fans out there, but /r/Dreadfort is a thing for some reason (I've already banned myself, thank you very much).

3. Speaking of surprising (at least to me) fanbases, Stannis has quite the following these days. Unclear how much of it is due to the catchiness of calling him Stannis the Mannis.

4. After hundreds of pages describing food, one dish rules them all: Frey Pie. To be serious for a moment, I completely missed this implication when reading and only learned about it here.

5. There's always *someone* convinced that a dead character isn't dead. Except maybe Joffrey. Haven't seen any tinfoil about him. But it's probably out there.

6. Everyone else's memory of details, minor houses, individual lines, and vague references makes me look like a bumbling fool. It also makes me look at the wiki a lot. Also, unless it's one of the major houses, your flair confuses me.

7. I'm glad this place exists to explain things as well as to go wildly off into speculation-land

While focusing on the IS allows many possibilities, looking at the HOW allows just one. The only weapon that both matches the prophecy 1 to 1 so far and has the potential to fully fulfill the prophecy is the sword Oathkeeper.

1 - Forged in water as Eddard's greatsword Ice.

2 - Reforged in a lion's breast as the Lannister sword Oathkeeper.

3 - This is the part that is speculation, but I am very confident in it, Brienne will be forced to drive Oathkeeper into Catelyn Tully's (the wife of the swords' original owner) heart and thus shatter both her own oaths and her swords' name. When she pulls the sword out it will inherit the flame passed down from R'hllor to Beric and from Beric to Catelyn, and burst into flames as the sword Lightbringer

Water, Lion, Wife - if Brienne kills Catelyn then the prophecy is matched word for word. This does not necessarily mean that Brienne is  THE Azor Ahai, but she will be the sword's forger.

edit: I'm flattered by all of the attention this theory is getting. Just to clarify, I do believe it is possible that there are multiple Lightbringers, much like there could be multiple Azor Ahai's, but Oathkeeper is the only sword that seems to have the potential to fulfil all the prerequsites - I can't see how Dany's dragons were forged in Water or shattered in a lion's breast'.

'Reforged in a lion's breast' could mean Brienne stabs Jamie as well, but I don't want Jamie to die, so I like to think the Lannisters ordering Ice to be shattered and reforged fulfiled that part of the prophecy. Also, I can't think of a sensible plotline where Brienne kills Jamie and then Catelyn, whereas her stabbing Catelyn to save Jamie (breaking her oaths, fulfiling the purely thematic destiny of her taking on Jamie's position as fallen knight while he rises into honor as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.) is very, very probable.

* First we have Littlefinger's nihilistic monologue about ""The Climb"" overlaying the careless disposal of one recurring character and the crushing of another's dreams. He insists that ""The Climb is all there is,"" and that the realm, gods, and love are merely ""illusions"" that people ""cling"" to. It would've been easy to end the episode with that shocking twist and cynical message.

* …Yet instead, the show makes a 180 degree turnaround and cuts away to the sublime moment of Jon and Ygritte finally reaching the top of the Wall, overlooking the world -- and yet caring most about falling into each other's arms. It's as if the show is rebutting Littlefinger, saying ""no, the climb isn't all there is."" Love is real, it is worthwhile and worth fighting for. Some have called this ending schmaltzy, but…

* …for those of us who know where this is going, it has a powerfully tragic undercurrent too. The happiness of Jon and Ygritte is doomed. Jon and Ygritte both have obligations to their respective peoples, and those peoples happen to be going to war. So yes, Littlefinger's not entirely wrong -- the love of Jon and Ygritte is a temporary illusion they are clinging to, soon to be torn apart by a chaotic world of warring humans. Yet it is beautiful, and genuine, and moving as well, while it exists.

This is my first venture into r/asoiaf territory, so I apologize if this has been brought up before.  But this is my favorite writing technique of George's that really adds a lot when looking at how he develops his characters and creates tragic moments in their lives.  Because he is so consistent with this, it may also be used when theorizing about the paths characters may take in TWOW and ADOS.

All of his characters have at least one thing that in a way defines them.  It can be something they love more than anything, a belief they hold dear, a goal they are striving towards, or an entire way of thinking.  George then takes that thing away from them, which typically becomes a catalyst for change in character.  Although sometimes he does this at the end of their life without giving them a chance to overcome/reclaim it, and it's his go-to move when he wants to create a really tragic moment. *See: Eddard Stark.*  
  
I've listed all the ones I can come up with, starting with the more important ones that I'm positive of and ending with more minor or ones that aren't as obvious.  I'd love for other input on characters I may have missed or ones I may have gotten wrong.  I'm sure there are a ton others, as he even does this with very minor characters.  
  
Listed is the character, what is most important to them, and the how/when it's taken away from them.  
  
**Eddard Stark, Honor:**  Forced to admit in front of everyone that he is dishonorable.  Killed with a headsman, which Ned had always believed to be dishonorable.  
    
**Catelyn Stark, Her Children/Family:**  GRRM is absolutely brutal here, taking away her entire family piece by piece.  She dies believing every one of them is dead.  

**Sansa Stark, Living a Fairy Tale:**  Finds out life is anything but.  Her Prince Charming beheads her father and abuses her.
  
**Jaime Lannister, Swordsmanship, Cersei:**  He gets his sword hand chopped off, leaving him helpless in a fight.  Grows less fond of Cersei and even kind of loathes her.  
  
**Cersei Lannister, Her Children, Jaime, Being Queen, Beauty:**  Joffrey is murdered in front of her eyes.  Myrcella is shipped to Dorne and becomes severely wounded.  Jaime and her grow apart.  Gets imprisoned and paraded naked through the streets.  

**Jon Snow, The Wall, Ygritte:**  Forced to abandon the Watch and become a Wildling.  Called turncloak.  Betrayed and stabbed by his own crows.  Ygritte dies in battle.
  
**Robb Stark, Vengeance, King in the North:**  Betrayed and murdered by his own bannermen at the request of Tywin Lannister.
  
**Tyrion Lannister, Love:**  Shae betrays him and then fucks his dad.  
  
**Tywin Lannister, His House/Family Legacy:**  The entire realm finds out his kids fuck each other, that his grandkids are inbreds, and his family claim to the throne is illegitimate.  Gets murdered on the pooper by his own son.

**Davos Seaworth, Serving Stannis, His Lucky Fingers(?), His Sons:**  He loses his fingers (again) and gets imprisoned for treason against his King by trying to murder Melisandre.  4 of his sons die in the Blackwater.  Devan becomes a servant of Melisandre, the very woman Davos tried to kill.
  
**Brienne of Tarth, Renly, Honorable Knight:**  Renly dies and she becomes an accused kingslayer.  Hanged for breaking her vow to Catelyn Stark, though she survives it by sacrificing her vow to Jaime.
  
**Theon Greyjoy, Wants to be Accepted, His Highborn Name, Banging Chicks:**  Ends up hated and rejected by pretty much everyone he's ever known.  Name changed into something foul, Reek.  Disfigured and possibly castrated by Ramsay Snow.
  
**Oberyn Martell, Vengeance for His Sister:**  This one's my favorite.  His vengeance is dangled in front of his face and taken away at the last moment, right before he is killed by the very same man who murdered his sister and her children.  Oh, and right before his face is smashed in, Gregor tells him that he raped Elia AFTER he killed her children, making her death even more horrible.  
  
**Barristan Selmy, The Kingsguard:**  Removed by Joffrey for being too old and useless.  
  
**Jorah Mormont, Daenerys:**  Shunned by Daenerys for being an informant for King Robert.  
  
**Stannis Baratheon, What is Lawfully His:**  Loses in his attempt to claim the Iron Throne in the Battle of the Blackwater.  
  
**Joffrey ""Baratheon,"" Being a Great King &amp;amp;amp;amp; Conqueror:**  Chokes on pigeon pie (poisoned) in front of everyone at his own wedding.  Dies as an inbred embarrassment of a King.  
  
**Khal Drogo, His Khalasar:**  Becomes too weak to be Khal and is abandoned.  
  
**Viserys Targaryen, Iron Throne:**  Killed by the men he hired to win it and his sister takes over his claim to it.  
  
I know there are tons of others that I've missed or aren't sure of, and some that maybe he won't or hasn't done this with yet.  I will also be adding some and editing these as I go and as people comment with corrections and better ideas and whatnot.  
  
**ADDED:**
  
**Bran Stark, Becoming a Knight:**  Falls and becomes a cripple.  
  
**Jeor Mormont, the Night's Watch:**  Betrayed and murdered by his own men.  
  
**Daenerys Targaryen, Drogo, Dragons, Iron Throne:**  Drogo dies, but from there it becomes questionable.  It's possible this already happened with her dragons with the events in ADWD.  And it seems her claim to the throne is going to be bested if it hasn't been already.  
  
**Samwell Tarly, Gilly:**  May have already happened in AFFC when Gilly was upset about her baby, though chances seem very likely they will be separated sometime in the next books.  
  
**Quentyn Martell, Winning Over Dany and Her Dragons:**  Immediately rejected by Daenerys and gets killed by her dragons.

Here's my theory:

The story ends with Bran having full control of weirwood.net and is overseeing the past, present and future through the weirwood eyes. As he is watching the remnants of human kind rebuild civilization after the devastating war of Ice &amp; Fire, he realizes that the only reason for humankind's survival, was because of his position as All knowing Master Tree. 

He then reaches out to the Weirwoods to watch an alternate future, where he would never have broken his legs, and sees the entire world in ruin. All humans in Westeros have perishes and wights roam from Dorne to the wall. Bran jerks back in shock and realizes what he needs to do.

1374608701.0,884,self.asoiaf,1iwlno,(Spoilers All) Possibly the most overrated character of all time: Tywin Lannister,WenchSlayer,1324,440,538,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1iwlno/spoilers_all_possibly_the_most_overrated/,"I see a lot of people on this subreddit as well as other places talk about Tywin Lannister as if he is some strategic demi-god, but I believe that he is nothing more than an extremely lucky cold hearted opportunist. 

To begin, most of his in-universe reputation comes not from his genius planning or tactical prowess, but from his brutality. The two things he is most well known for is destroying Castamere and sacking Kings Landing. Neither of these required any masterful planning. The Reynes were his vassal, and he vastly outnumbered him. He is not famous for the battle itself, but rather being a huge dick afterwards. In Kings Landing he had the gates opened for him, and sacked the place. He might have gained in the short term, but made most people distrust  and despise him in the longrun.

But lets move on to the War of Five Kings, a war which if not for a few freak occurrences out of Tywins control, he should have been crushed in. 

The biggest one of these in my opinion, is Stannis killing Renly with his shadow baby. Without the shadow baby, Stannis either stays brooding in dragonstone or is crushed by Renly's overwhelming force of Tyrells and Stormlords. After this Renly would have easily have taken Kings Landing, with Tywin stuck in the riverlands. Tywin would then have Renly on one side and the Young Wolf on the other, making it only matter of time before he is crushed. Even if he manages to make it to Kings Landing before Renly, he stands no chance against the forces of Renly and Robb combined, and no amount of his deception and dickery will save him. 

Speaking of Robb, pretty much every bad thing that happens to Robb has nothing to do with Tywin. Robb was beating the lannisters at every point, even taking out Jaime's host early on. Robb letting Theon go, and him subsequently taking Winterfell was a stroke of dumb luck for Tywin, who was losing at this point. This causes Robb to be 'comforted' and lose his Frey men. Tywin also has nothing to do with Cat being dumb and letting Jaime go, causing Karstark to go kill the Lannister prisoners and make Robb lose his Karstark men. All of a sudden Robb has lost most of his army, and it has nothing to do with Tywin. All Tywin does is team  up with a couple of despicable dudes to finish off a Young Wolf who had pretty much defeated himself at this point.

Tactically everything Tywin did in the war of five kings was pretty much a farce. He was beat by Robb at every turn, and even got beat back by Edmure. Thats right folks, even Edmure was a better tactician than Tywin. Tywin sets up Kings Landing to be ripe for the taking for Renly, and is only able to stop Stannis from taking it because of Tyrion's chain and wildfire and Littlefingers plotting bringing the Tyrells to his side. 

Tywins biggest strength is also his biggest weakness. All of his 'friends' despise him because of his ruthlessness and are constantly plotting against him. Littlefinger, Varys, the Tyrells (especially the queen of thorns), The Martells, and others are constantly plotting against Tywin, and were all outplaying him. At the first sign of weakness all of house Lannister's 'friends' turn against them, because of the resentment Tywin created. His greatest ambition of securing the future of his house was set up for inevitable failure, even if he had lived.

Finally his dickishness is perhaps the greatest towards Tyrion, who could have been Tywin's biggest asset if treated differently. Instead his insecurity about the appearance of his house and his resentment at Tyrion for 'causing' the death of Tywin's wife becomes his ultimate downfall, and he dies while taking a shit, which all things considered,was a rather fitting end.

Cersei's prophecy is clearly lifted straight from Snow White. In fact, Cersei has way too many parallels to the evil Queen. 

* The Queen in the tale is described as the most beautiful woman of the time. She is incredibly proud, narcissitic and supercilious. That sounds exactly like Cersei. 

* The Queen has a mirror. Cersei has her own mirror. The mirror is Jaime. Cersei who has slept with many men and a woman in her life only finds Jaime to be a pleasant company abed because she sees herself in him. 
&gt; Words are wind, don't listen to them.  I am beautiful, Jamie says so, he'd never lie to me. Even Robert thinks i am beautiful.


* The queen sends Snow White on a hunt to kill her. Our sweet Cersei sends Robert to a hunt to kill him.  

* The huntsman in Snow  White returns with a boar's organs which the Queen eats. Cersei gleefully consumes her own boar which slew Robert. She even comments on the hearty meal in a way only she can.

&gt;  There has never been a boar so delicious.

* The Queen attempts to kill Snow White even though Snow is only a child. Cersei has never shied away from partaking in the proud  Lannister family tradition of killing children.

* The Queen is warned of a more beautiful queen. Maggy warns Cersei of a younger more beautiful queen.

The Queen attempts to kill Snow White by poisoning her hair, by feeding her a poisoned apple and by strangulation from a lace. These methods are used in the Pink Wedding. 

* The hair net of Sansa is the poison in the hair.

* Strangulation is the way with which Joffrey dies. Joffrey consumes the poison called the Strangler. However, there is no apple here. There is a person with the  apple as the sigil  present in the room Lady Leonette Fossoway who could be the one who poisoned Joffrey.

* The Queen's plans are constantly thwarted by meddling dwarves. Tyrion. 

*  The prophecy of the coming of Snow White and the younger queen of Cersei are told after a finger is pricked and a drop of blood is bled.

So, who is Snow White? I believe she is Sansa. Sansa is described as very beautiful at a young age. Snow White's stepmum tries to kill her. Sansa's ""stepmum"" Lysa Arryn tries to kill her. ""Snow"" is the name given to the bastards in the North. Sansa is now acting like a bastard. Both Snow White and Sansa are orphans. Both the girls are helped by dwarves. So Sansa *could* be the younger more beautiful queen. Cersei believes she killed Joffrey. 

If this theory is correct, we can look forward to the following:

* The huntsman does not follow the Queen's orders and spares Snow White. Randyll Tarly now has the custody of the Margery and her cousins. He may refuse to kill the girls and help or allow them to escape.

* The queen  meets a morbid end after she is made to dance till she drops after she is made to  wear red hot iron shoes. Tongs are used to put them on. Iron shoes are mentioned only once in the series.

&gt; I love the Smith. Without his labor, what would the Warrior defend? Every town has a smith, and every castle. They make the plows we need to plant our crops, the nails we use to build our ships, iron shoes to save the hooves of our faithful horses, the bright swords of our lords.

Do we know a smith who is also a not the eldest son? Why yes, of course. Gendry who looks hauntingly like our beloved king Robert Baratheon, a man Cersei hates. He also knows how to use a pair of tongs. How deliciously ironic  would it be if Sansa and ""Robert"" kill Cersei? If Sansa is not present during Cersei's dying moments, i am sure she'll hear the news of Sansa's marriage before dying.

Jaime and Cersei often think that they'll die together. They could die at the same time. Nothing says that Jaime must kill her. So, Gendry could be the valonqar. I do not know about the glass coffin. Any Thoughts?

Jen and I did almost 0% of the work in the end, so a massive thank you to /u/feldman10 for doing this.

**How was this done, when GRRM himself doesn't even keep a detailed timeline?**

* Almost everything in this document has been cross-referenced with other events to create a clear picture.  Everything is connected with other dates, so hypothetically, if one event were to seriously change - it could change *everything*.

* There is only one fixed date in the entire series that we can be 100% sure of and that is the events of 1 January 300 since it is specifically mentioned in the text that this day is the start of a new century *[ASOS Tyrion VII (658) - ASOS Sansa V (688)]*.

**What we need from you:**

* Please go over this timeline and search for mistakes and/or add information to blank fields.  Although many, many hours has been put into researching this information, not many eyes have seen this - so there are bound to be errors.  If you see something that is wrong, fix it!

* We want to figure out the best way to convert the information from the excel document to the [wiki page.](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/wiki/timeline)  The wiki page is pretty bare right now, so please feel free to edit it and mess around with formatting.  Although we will eventually need people to help uploading this information, what we really need right now is to figure out the best way to format the information.  

* While there are other amazing timelines on the web, [such as this one](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Years_after_Aegon%27s_Landing) that details events by *year*, there is none even close to as specific as this one.

1369234528.0,814,self.asoiaf,1eu4xn,(Spoilers ADWD) Tywin Lannister and Tyrion's Bedding,LOHare,978,164,312,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1eu4xn/spoilers_adwd_tywin_lannister_and_tyrions_bedding/,"Background:

I'm pretty sure Tywin's character is well established among readers. From childhood, he saw his weak father mocked and challenged, his authority ignored and house Lannister's prestige besmirched. It fell to him to put these wrongs to right. This may have made him more rash and extreme than he may have otherwise been.

He is so grim and apprehensive all the time that he utterly lacks a sense of humour and will not tolerate any jape at him or his any of house-hold - even those he himself despises. All his actions and all his plans serve the power and prestige of house Lannister. Any personal gain or pleasure is secondary side-effect.

I am sure he loves his children in a fatherly fashion, but again it manifests only in the form of serving the glory of his house. He starts a war to get Tyrion back, not because he cares about his son Tyrion, but because he cares about the Lannister name. He arranges the marriages of his children, not for their happiness, not for his personal gain, but for securing the power of his house.

This is his feeling towards his own children, what does he care about Sansa Stark or her feelings? I would think very little to none.

The Bedding:

Joffery is ready to **command** that the ceremony takes place, and he does implicitly command it, and just about ready to say the words to make it an official command. Tyrion *threatens* the insecure vindictive sadist, all but ensuring that in retaliation Joffery will not only stand his ground, but make things worse.

Tywin steps in not only to diffuse the situation, but also persuade Joffery away from the inclination by making excuse of drunkenness. There are several reasons Tywin would have done this. No matter how well-endowed, a bedding would be embarrassing for a deformed guy like Tyrion. Tywin may not love him much as a son, but definitely won't stand an insult to a Lannister. 

He knows how unstable and rash Joffery his, and despite his earlier encounter with Joff, it is still a risky move to cross him when his blood is up like in this scene. I personally think, it was more than the prestige of his house that moved him to this decision. I think for once (other than his smile at his own wedding), we get a glimpse of the softer side of Tywin. Ser Barristan's narration to Dany in ADWD about Tywin's wedding:

&gt;The white knight chose his words with care. “Prince Aerys … as a youth, he was taken with a certain lady of Casterly Rock, a cousin of Tywin Lannister. When she and Tywin wed, your father drank too much wine at the wedding feast and was heard to say that it was a great pity that the lord’s right to the first night had been abolished. A drunken jape, no more, but **Tywin Lannister was not a man to forget such words, or the … the liberties your father took during the bedding**.” His face reddened. “I have said too much, Your Grace. I—”

Tywin saw the exact same thing repeated. A douchebag royalty drunk with power and lust seeking to take liberties with the wife of a Lannister. He knows how it feels and he is not one to forget it. I think in this scene he is protecting his son Tyrion more than his house Lannister. I really think this move was made more out of sentiment than cold calculation.

Of course there were other reasons as well. Tyrion was drunk and since he had already thrust a knife in the table and uttered the threat in full view of everyone, his inhibitions were non-existant, and he could have made good on the threat had Joff persisted. But I am sure the Kingsguard were more than capable of diffusing this threat.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1369235628.0,,,True,t3_1eu4xn,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1eu4xn/spoilers_adwd_tywin_lannister_and_tyrions_bedding/,

Recently, I introduced my husband to A Song of Ice and Fire. He watched the HBO series with me through season 2, enjoyed it, and is taking the plunge into the behemoth that is ASOIAF. (HUZZAH.)

I have desperately been trying to keep him away from spoilers because as the title suggests, I'm evil and I want to see his reaction to certain *ahem* events. He's in the middle of ACoK and so far (KNOCK ON WOOD) has been able to stay away from anything major. (I'm looking at you ASoS and ADwD!) 

However, the other night he watched an interview on YouTube and then the conversation went as follows: 

""I watched an interview with GRRM today about Season 3 and he mentioned the Red Wedding."" 

*PANIC* ""...and?"" 

""I know what's going to happen. It's SO obvious."" 

""...What do you think is going to happen?"" 

""The Red Priestess, Melisandre, is going to kill Stannis."" 

""....Wow. How did you ever guess?"" 

""Well, it can't stay the War of Five Kings forever. One of the Kings has to die. It makes sense that it's Stannis. RED Priestess. RED Wedding. Duh."" 

""It's a shame GRRM made it so obvious to astute readers like yourself."" 

""Exactly. I can't wait to read all five books. My boy Robb is KILLIN' it with his badassery.""

I think it is my civic duty to troll him until he reaches the Red Wedding.

We came to the sad realization, as many probably do, that what we want to happen probably will not.  So with that in mind we started discussing things that we think will happen because we don’t want them to.  Much like when George Costanza changed his life by doing the exact opposite of what he thought he should.

Below are our ideas and what brought us to them.  This is not very fleshed out and only hits some high points.  Also our depth of knowledge is not as deep as many of you here.  We would love help filling this in and hearing your own “George Costanza” theories.


 - Aegon wins with dragons!!  Marries Margaery Tyrell (because they all do) Tyrells power behind throne.  
(Neither of us is very supportive of a character that is introduced in the 5th book that could end up winning the game.  So of course that is what will happen.)

 - Dany - Killed by Drogon when Victarion makes Daario blow the Horn.  
(Neither of us is sure about Victarion but we do both want Daenerys to ride her dragons to victory. So this cannot happen.  What is the worst outcome?  To us it’s a mother being slain by her children.  Daario being killed is a side bonus for an overall horrible end to Dany.) 

 - Victarion - Returns to Westeros with dragons and at some point loses dragons to Aegon.   
(This is just a consequence of the first two points.  No idea how it would work)

 - Bran - Chronicler only - stays tree forever.  
(We both want Bran to do something and kick ass, so he won’t.  Jojen, Meera, and Hodor TBD)

 - Jaime - Killed protecting Cercie  
(We both like Jaime and dislike Cersei.  So for Jaime to be honorable and die protecting his sister, while noble, would be disappointing.  We were torn because this does keep things “good” for Jamie and is not outright a bad end, and could be done really well, we both just don’t want him to die.  So of course he will die.  As a side note we started off by having everyone we like die, but that would be extreme, then again it is GRRM.)

 - Connington dies from greyscale and Roose Bolton becomes hand of the king.  
(this follows from the first point.  If Aegon does win, and because he has been groomed to be a good king, we can’t have him or us actually get a happy ending.  So who better to cause strife than our man Roose?) 

 - White Walkers - also win. They win in the north and the final vestiges of the Starks land.  If the South does pull together they stop the White Walkers at the neck or eventually push them back to the neck after rampaging in the South.  Either way the North is lost to the White Walkers.

 - Rickon becomes a wildling

 - Jon snow – Stays dead and R+L=J is never confirmed after death.

(Again a plot line that we want to turn into something cool but will turn to nothing instead)

 - Ramsey befriends Qyburn - Much fun is had 

 - Stannis defaults on his loan from Iron Bank and is killed by Arya.  While in the north to take out Stannis, Arya sees Winterfell overrun by white walkers, her childhood home destroyed.  Arya leaves Westeros never to return.

 - Tyrion rides a donkey in a midget show/juggler for the rest or his life.

However it speaks to the GreyJoys more than that. The Greyjoys do not sow. They don't plan ahead!!!

Balon Greyjoy randomly attacked the North and the seven kingdoms for no reason and got his ass royally kicked by Ned and Robert. He did so again when the North was weak and accomplished essentially nothing for it, before dying.

Theon Greyjoy betrayed Robb Stark his friend and near brother for his asshole family so that they could randomly raid some meaningless castles along the coast until he gets the bright idea to take Winterfell. It becomes almost immediately clear that there's no way in hell he can hold it and he stubbornly like his father sticks with his ridiculous plan and it lands him in deep disturbing trouble.

Victarion Greyjoy follows his brother who he hate's order and sails halfway across the world to betray him, not even considering that perhaps he is being outsmarted.

&gt; Littlefinger: “Leave Lord Varys to me… I hold the man’s balls in the palm of my hand.""

The following is my analysis of the game Littlefinger and Varys have been playing in the series so far. Let me know what parts you agree with or disagree with.

**Ultimate goals:**

* Littlefinger: Power for himself, ending in control of Westeros

* Varys: Aegon on the Iron Throne, in control of Westeros

**Opening move and initial strategy:**

* Littlefinger gets Lysa to poison Jon Arryn. He intends to divide Westeros with civil war ASAP, opening up lands and titles for himself, so he can improve his status enough to marry Lysa. He has Lysa write to Catelyn and blame the Lannisters for her husband's death.

* Varys marries Dany off to the Dothraki. He intends to divide Westeros with civil war… eventually.  Then Drogo and the Golden Company can conquer the continent and install Aegon on the throne. But the time isn't right for war yet. This disagreement over the proper timing of a civil war puts Littlefinger and Varys (unknowingly) at odds.

&gt; “Illyrio: ""Too soon, too soon. What good is war now? We are not ready. Delay.”

**Middle of AGOT:**

* Littlefinger tells Catelyn that the dagger was Tyrion's. 

* LF's pawns move forward: Cat seizes Tyrion, and Ned begins investigating Jon Arryn's murder

* Varys panics to Illyrio that war is coming much faster than they expected (though he hasn't grasped the extent of Littlefinger's role in bringing this about). ""The khal will not bestir himself until his son is born,"" Illyrio says. But they need Drogo to go west now. 

* So Varys tells Robert that Dany is pregnant, knowing he'll order an assassination attempt. Varys orders the attempt, and also tips off Jorah. But he doesn't truly care if Dany lives or dies, either way he gets what he wants -- an angry Drogo stampeding west.

* One result of this move by Varys is that Ned feuds with Robert, resigns his office as Hand, and prepares to leave the city. This is no good for Littlefinger -- he needs Ned to keep investigating the bastards, so there will be war. So Littlefinger counters Varys again -- delaying Ned's departure by all of a sudden revealing the location of Robert's bastard daughter at a brothel. Ned goes to check it out, and lo and behold, the news that Cat has taken Tyrion has suddenly reached Jaime, who attacks Ned. Tensions are spiraling out of control.

* Varys keeps trying to stabilize things, but he fails. Cersei has Robert killed (Varys suggests this was Ned's fault for confronting her), and Littlefinger takes the opportunity to provoke Ned into launching a coup, then betrays him, cementing his place in the Lannister court.

&gt; Varys: “If there was one soul in King’s Landing who was truly desperate to keep Robert Baratheon alive, it was me.” 

**End of AGOT:**

* As Varys awaits word from Jorah, he again tries to stave off war by convincing Ned to confess his treason and admit Joffrey's legitimacy. He seems to succeed.

* Littlefinger says, psych! He has suggested to Joffrey that executing Ned would be a better idea, and Joffrey takes the suggestion. After this affront, war is certain. 

* So LF wins this round, war has broken out and the genie can't be put back in the bottle. Worse yet for Varys, he gets terribly unlucky when Drogo dies from a freak wound and his khalasar disperses. 

&gt; Tywin: ""Alive, we might have used Lord Eddard to forge a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, a peace that would have given us the time we need to deal with Robert’s brothers. Dead… Madness. Rank madness.”

**ACOK-ADWD: LF's continued ascent, Varys' many follies**

* For the rest of the series so far, Littlefinger and Varys are playing unrelated games that aren't conflicting with each other.

* Littlefinger arranges each new step of his meteoric rise in Westeros, picking up his own heir to a great house on the way and going a long way toward consolidating power in the Vale.

* Varys' only immediate concern in Westeros is maintaining his position at court, while in Essos he must find another army (or its equivalent) for Aegon. Then, Varys gets incredibly lucky when Jorah writes to him from Qarth and he becomes the only person in Westeros to know Dany has three living dragons. He sends ships to bring Dany back to Pentos; with the dragons in hand, Aegon's conquest will be assured. But this time he's foiled by his own spy Jorah, who tells Dany to go to Slaver's Bay and get an army of her own. Then, Varys' position at court is compromised because of Jaime's meddling. Varys tries to roll with the punches and send Aegon to go meet Dany -- but he's foiled again by Tyrion, who convinces the boy to go west and abandon the dragons. 

* Varys is playing an inherently more difficult game than LF -- his goal is to put a specific person on the throne rather than merely to aggrandize himself. But even with this in mind, basically everything Varys has tried for the past four books has failed, and now his endgame piece has invaded Westeros with a woefully small force. ""Fuck it,"" the eunuch says, ""I guess I have to make this happen without Dothraki or dragons."" So people in King's Landing start to get assassinated...

**What's next?** 

* Varys' hand has been forced, so we will, for the first time ever, see his true skill as he pulls out all the stops to get Aegon on the throne. For years, he's likely been preparing various major and minor contingency plans all around Westeros for Aegon's arrival, and now he will have to set them all in motion.  Then, even if Aegon does take King's Landing, Varys will have to deal with a potentially mistrustful Dany who will have three dragons and a devious dwarf at her side -- but first things first. 

* Littlefinger, for the first time in the whole series, will be on the defensive. Two very powerful pieces will be entering the game: Aegon will have the full force of Varys behind him and perhaps be acclaimed savior of Westeros, but by now LF has also certainly heard reports of the Targaryen queen with 3 dragons. LF may thrive on chaos, but this is a little much, especially considering he has been most effective operating from the inside, and he has no likely entree to either Aegon or Dany's camp.

* Some have suggested that LF's best next move would be to marry Sansa to Aegon -- with the forces of Dorne, the Vale, ""friends in the Reach,"" and the Golden Company, Westeros will be theirs. But with Varys backing Aegon this is unlikely to get LF the unrivaled power in Westeros he so desires, and if Dany shows up and wars with Aegon, this could be a fatal mistake. 

* Another complication is the likely rise of the only potential player who can reach Varys and LF's level -- Tyrion. He will likely be at Dany's side -- he hates Littlefinger, and LF has already tried to kill him two or three times. He has no great love for Varys either, having just ruined his plans by sending Aegon west.

* So I would recommend that LF try to stoke a war between Aegon and Dany and stay out of the conflict. Another round of destruction in the south would make the military and agricultural power of the Vale, and Littlefinger's own financial riches, ever more important. (This stuff will also be very important if an undead ice army happens to invade.) Don't marry off Sansa, keep her in reserve to eventually be queen of Westeros. If necessary, kneel to the side with dragons and try to stay as far away from those dragons (and Tyrion) as possible, so you'll live to plot another day.

* And I wouldn't count out Varys yet easier. Most people assume that Aegon will end up roasted by a dragon. But surely Varys will be aware of this possibility and try to keep Aegon away from the dragons if Dany seems antagonistic. Even if Dany temporarily puts Aegon's forces on the ropes, there are many political factors working against Dany in the long-term just like in Meereen (Aegon will have gotten the ""savior mantle"" by deposing the hated Cersei, Dany will be bringing all these foreigners to a starving continent and potentially hated ironborn too, Dorne will have backed Aegon and will be angry about Quentyn's death). If Aegon and Varys manage to survive an initial clash with Dany, they could very well defeat her in the long-term, despite the dragons.

* My literary prediction is that during book 7, as a magical conflict unfolds with Jon, Dany, dragons and Others, a separate political contest will be unfolding between Tyrion, Varys, and Littlefinger to determine the ultimate victor in the game of thrones.

**tl;dr: Littlefinger has been cleaning Varys' clock in the game of thrones so far. But with Aegon landed, the dragons coming, and Tyrion about to join as a true player, it's still anyone's game.** ",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1353433176.0,,TheImp,True,t3_13ib1b,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/13ib1b/spoilers_all_littlefinger_has_badly_outplayed/,
1376332390.0,729,self.asoiaf,1k80pg,(Spoilers All) The Endgame of the Faceless Men,shopeIV,884,155,307,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1k80pg/spoilers_all_the_endgame_of_the_faceless_men/,"This theory has to do with what I believe the endgame of the Faceless Men is, and how they mean to achieve it.  If you look at the text there are clues that show dragon eggs can be extraordinarily dangerous. Additionally, the Faceless Men have clear ideals that guide them beyond the simple desire to spread the gift.  I believe the Faceless Men will use the dragon egg they obtained from Euron Greyjoy to attempt another Doom.  

**The Faceless Men and the Doom**

In AFFC, the Kindly Man tells Arya about the history of the Faceless Men, saying,

&gt; ""All gods have their instruments, men and women who serve them and help to work their will on earth. The slaves were not crying out to a hundred different gods, as it seemed, but to one god with a hundred different faces . . . and he was that god’s instrument. That very night he chose the most wretched of the slaves, the one who had prayed most earnestly for release, and freed him from his bondage. The first gift had been given.""
Arya drew back from him. ""He killed the slave?"" That did not sound right. ""He should have killed the masters!""
""He would bring the gift to them as well . . . but that is a tale for another day, one best shared with no one.""

I believe the Kindly Man is insinuating that the Faceless Men brought about the Doom (giving the gift to the masters) and that he is waiting until he truly believes Arya is ""no one"" to tell her the full story.

About 600 years before the beginning of the series Hardhome is destroyed.  

&gt;Hardhome had been halfway toward becoming a town, the only true town north of the Wall, until the night six hundred years ago when hell had swallowed it. Its people had been carried off into slavery or slaughtered for meat, depending on which version of the tale you believed, their homes and halls consumed in a conflagration that burned so hot that watchers on the Wall far to the south had thought the sun was rising in the north. Afterward ashes rained down on haunted forest and Shivering Sea alike for almost half a year. Traders reported finding only nightmarish devastation where Hardhome had stood, a landscape of charred trees and burned bones, waters choked with swollen corpses, blood-chilling shrieks echoing from the cave mouths that pocked the great cliff that loomed above the settlement. 

In ADWD, Tyrion recalls what he knows of the Doom, thinking,

&gt;It was written that on the day of the Doom every hill for five hundred miles had split asunder to fill the air with ash and smoke and fire, blazes so hot and hungry that even the dragons in the sky were engulfed and consumed. Great rents had opened in the earth, swallowing palaces, temples, entire towns. Lakes boiled or turned to acid, mountains burst, fiery fountains spewed molten rock a thousand feet into the air, red clouds rained down dragonglass and the black blood of demons, and to the north the ground splintered and collapsed and fell in on itself and an angry sea came rushing in.

To me these two tales sound remarkably similar.  The destruction of Hardhome happened nearly 200 years prior to the Doom, leading me to believe it was a test run by the Faceless Men. However, how did the Faceless Men cause these events to occur?

**Dragon Eggs**
Throughout the series there are many mentions of the dangers associated with attempting to hatch dragon eggs.  In ASOS, Lord Alester Florent says,

&gt;Did we learn nothing from Aerion Brightfire, from the nine mages, from the alchemists? Did we learn nothing from *Summerhall*? No good has ever come from these dreams of dragons.

In ADWD, Daenerys, reflects,

&gt; ending at Summerhall in sorcery, fire, and grief.

In AFFC, Aemon reflects on Summerhall saying,

&gt;the smoke was from the fire that devoured Summerhall on the day of his [Rhaegar's] birth

Additionally, the Ghost of High Heart says when she sees Arya,

&gt; ""I see you. I see you, wolf child. Blood child. I thought it was the lord who smelled of death... You are cruel to come to my hill, cruel. I gorged on grief at Summerhall, I need none of yours. Begone from here, dark heart. Begone!""

Clearly she has suffered from what occurred at Summerhall. However, I have always found it strange that when she sees Arya she immediately thinks of Summerhall.  I think the Ghost of High Heart may see Arya's future as a Faceless Man and some part of unconscious connects the Faceless Men to Summerhall.

Clearly some cataclysmic event costing lives occurred at Summerhall. Additionally, Alester Florent speaks of other attempts to hatch dragon eggs all of which ended in disaster.  **I want to say that I do not necessarily think the Faceless Men caused all of these events to go wrong (although it is possible) the rest of the theory is not dependent upon that. But rather to show that hatching dragon eggs is a very dangerous business.**  Even when Daenerys successfully hatches her eggs, the event seems dangerous and Daenerys sees strange visions in the flames.

My theory is that the Faceless men did something with dragon eggs inside the valcanos at Hardhome and the Fourteen Fires (perhaps fourteen eggs in fourteen different volcanoes here) to cause destruction.  When the Valyrians first discovered the dragons they were lairing in the Fourteen Fires. However, I believe attempts by humans using sorcery to hatch dragon eggs in these areas could have disastrous results. 

**Euron Greyjoy, Jaqen H'ghar, and the Dragon Egg**

Like most people I believe, Euron paid the Faceless Men with a dragon egg to kill Balon.  Relevant quotes for this theory are the Ghost of High Heart saying,

&gt; ""I dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung. On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings.""

We know from Littlefinger in AGOT that the price for the Faceless Men to kill a King would be astronomical but we also know from Arya that the price is always payable if the client is willing.  Euron claims that he once had a dragon's egg but,

&gt; ""I threw it into the sea during one of my dark moods.""

Euron is insane, but he is not stupid.  He would not get ride of something so valuable and receive nothing in return. Thus, I believe the Faceless Men have that Dragon Egg.

Along with most people I believe Jaqen has infiltrated the Citadel as Pate and is attempting to steal the only remaining copy of the book ""The Death of the Dragons"" that Tyrion mentions in ADWD. I think this is insurance for the Faceless Men should their main attempt to kill Daenery's dragons fail and they need another way to kill them.

**The Endgame**

There is a lot of instances of the Braavosi sharing their opinions of dragons which is not high.  Even if the Braavosi and the Faceless Men think Daenerys is doing a good thing by freeing slaves. I think the fear the mere existence of dragons.  What if Daenerys dies, who controls the dragons then? Deanerys has already shown signs of being unable to control her dragons and I think the Faceless Men see this as a problem.  

I believe the Faceless Men know Daenerys will eventually come to Westeros and they will allow her to free slaves across Essos on her way there.  One place I think they know Daenerys will visit is Dragonstone. Not only is it the ancestral home of the Targaryen's but it is the place of Daenerys' birth.  We know that the Dragonmont on Dragonstone is an active valcano and I think the Faceless Men will attempt to recreate the Doom with Euron's dragon egg here when Daenerys (eventually) arrives.

**TL;DR The Faceless Men will use the dragons egg they received from Euron to attempt to recreate the Doom on Dragonstone when Daenerys arrives.**

Since she started, she's been using me for her vent, and it's hilarious and super hard not to spoil anything, I told her I wouldn't but I asked her to test me all her feelings, thoughts, and concerns about the book. I thought my fellow crows would be as entertained as I am. She isn't too far, but she's quite good at figuring things out. Here follows her texts to me verbatim.

* ""WHY WOULD THEY KILL BRAN?!?! I loved Bran!! Stupid Lannisters! I hate them!""

* ""This is appalling!!! Jon and Tyrion are my favorites now that they killed off Bran!
Ugh! Well bran was before the blonde demon threw him off a freaking building!""

* ""Why did you get me addicted to this book?!?! I have things to do but I'm too distracted!!""

* ""This is the bane of my existence... I've never felt so many emotions in such quick succession in my life!!""

* ""I just feels like this whole book is building up to something really huge... I just can't figure it out yet!!!! And it's killing me!!!""

* ""I think lysa poisoned the old hand... He threatened to take her son away and kill him""

* ""If that's the case, the only question the is, why in the world would she want to blame the Lannisters and warn her sister when there was nothing at the time to warn of? Though they would have killed him anyway since he found out Robert has no true heirs...""

* ""Shit!!! Robert is about to die!!! All hell s about to break loose!! That's it!! That's what this whole book has been leading up to!! It's about to be a civil war in the seven kingdoms!!!""

* ""Well ned is a clever bastard for writing ""his heir"" instead of Joffery... But there would be hell finding an heir and a hundred hoes are gonna show up and claiming that they have the ""true her"" which is false! There is no ""true heir"" which is the whole damn problem! Also... ALSO that stupid boar was no accident! I bet a Lannister is the one that suggested the whole thing!!! And the fool of a drunk king took the bait!!""

* ""I am being driven insane!!! In the end I almost Dany's kid takes over!! For some reason I have a feeling history is about to repeat itself... with the dragon eggs!! Like old history!!""

* ""Little dude has 3 dragons!! How can you not see the parallels!!""

* ""How can anyone not?!?! Now I just want to know how this business with ""the others"" ties in... That was the opening of the book, so obviously it has huge significance... But I just can't put my finger on it yet!!""


I hope you are enjoying these as much as I am. I may or may not post more if she continues texting me. 

UPDATE!!:

* ""If she gives birth to ducking dragons I am going to be pissed!!!""

* ""Back to Jon... What is his deal!!! I'm at a loss as to why he's included at all! It's very interesting and GE is one of my favorites, but as of yet, I see no relation between Jon and the game of thrones everyone else is playing.""

* ""They killed eddard!! The bastards illed him! And now I'm punching a pillow, and I'm baby sitting and they're about to return and I have to compose myself... But I can't!! I just can't!""

* ""Do you know what this means!! The truth dies with him!""

* ""THEBEEFYMUNGPIE DO NO FALL ASLEEP ON ME!""

She called me about 5 minutes later in hysterics. She was driving home from the kids she was babysitting, and you could tell she had just finished crying. I literally had no idea what she was saying for the first 2 minutes on the phone, and then she called down and told me how embarrassing it was to be crying as the parents came back. And then she reiterated to me how she couldn't believe Ned died, and how she couldn't understand how there were stil 200 pages to go. I realized that she was only at the part right after Ned's leg broke, and Ned hadn't even died yet. It took all my will not to laugh over the phone at this moment. She's not gonna be able to handle the actual beheading. Let alone scenes such as the RW... I can't wait.

Hope you enjoyed this little bit. I'll add more if she continues texting me.d

But I don't get it. I think ADWD was my favorite book because of how it set up Meereen, and I'm the most excited for TWOW to see how that battle plays out, and here's why.

Meereen is about to be the awesomest and most epic blood bath in the entire series so far. 

1. There are two uncontrollable dragons sitting in massive pyramids like Smaug in his mountain burning people who fuck with them.

2. The most hardcore navy in the world is sailing there in force to pay the iron price for some serious shit.

3. The most hardcore cavalry in the world is heading there (I think) with Mrs. Fire and Blood, because she has the most badass mount ever, which is an even bigger and scarier dragon than the other two.

4. According to a brilliant and convincing post [Dragons plant no trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1f6wpn/spoilers_all_dragons_plant_no_trees/) Mrs. Fire and Blood is finally ready to burn everybody to the ground.

5. Half of the free cities are at war with Dany, most of which are more powerful and more badass than 99% of Westeros. That means thousands and thousands of merciless sell swords who just want to kill everyone and plunder everything, are either already there or heading there.

6. There is a plague killing everybody in brutal, disgusting fashion. Literally hundreds of thousands of people are shitting out their intestines in the hot dry sand.

7. The most hardcore foot soldiers in the world are already there, under the command of the greatest knight currently alive. 

7. Two of the three main characters of the series, Tyrion and Dany, are at the very center of this whole clusterfuck. 

When all these forces clash together it's going to make every other big battle, at the Wall, at Winterfell, on the Blackwater, at Astapor, look like effing skirmishes. With all this in mind, can anyone convince me to dislike the Meereen situation?

Tyrion seems utterly convinced afterwards that Cersei is the one who put him up to this, but I do not believe this is the case.

***

##WHO WAS MANDON MOORE?

Jaime described him as one of the most dangerous men in the Kingsguard, because his eyes gave nothing away. He was generally not well-liked and even laughed at Barristan after he got kicked out of the Kingsguard. During the mob in King's Landing following Myrcella's send-off Mandon abandons Sansa (who he was tasked with protecting) and instead protects Joffrey. Tyrion later scolds him for this.

Varys gives us the best insight into Ser Mandon when Tyrion questions him:

&gt;Bronn had turned up all he could on Ser Mandon, but no doubt Varys knew a deal more . . . should he choose to share it. “The man seems to have been quite friendless,” Tyrion said carefully.  
“Sadly,” said Varys, “oh, sadly. You might find some kin if you turned over enough stones back in the Vale, but here . . . Lord Arryn brought him to King’s Landing and Robert gave him his white cloak, but neither loved him much, I fear. Nor was he the sort the smallfolk cheer in tourneys, despite his undoubted prowess. Why, even his brothers of the Kingsguard never warmed to him. Ser Barristan was once heard to say that the man had no friend but his sword and no life but duty . . . but you know, I do not think Selmy meant it altogether as praise. Which is queer when you consider it, is it not? Those are the very qualities we seek in our Kingsguard, it could be said—men who live not for themselves, but for their king. By those lights, our brave Ser Mandon was the perfect white knight. And he died as a knight of the Kingsguard ought, with sword in hand, defending one of the king’s own blood.” The eunuch gave him a slimy smile and watched him sharply.  
*Trying to murder one of the king’s own blood, you mean*. Tyrion wondered if Varys knew rather more than he was saying.

^(ASOS 12: TYRION II)

From this we know Ser Mandon originally came from the Vale and was brought to King's Landing by Jon Arryn. We also see that he had few friends and seemingly no allegiances but to his own duty. Who put him up to murdering Tyrion? Let's explore the candidates...

***

##SELF-MOTIVATED

It is possible that Ser Mandon killed Tyrion of his own volition. He is a generally non-reactive character, but you could make the argument that Tyrion antagonized him. Ser Mandon was apparently acquainted with Ser Vardis Egen -- the man Bronn killed in Tyrion's Eyrie trial. This information is used to somewhat taunt Ser Mandon when Tyrion first meets him:

&gt;“Ser Mandon, you have not met my companions. This is Timett son of Timett, a red hand of the Burned Men. And this is Bronn. Perchance you recall Ser Vardis Egen, who was captain of Lord Arryn’s household guard?”  
“I know the man.” Ser Mandon’s eyes were pale grey, oddly flat and lifeless.  
“Knew,” Bronn corrected with a thin smile.  
Ser Mandon did not deign to show that he had heard that.

^(ACOK 3: TYRION I)

Later Ser Mandon is assigned as Sansa's personal guard when the riot occurs after Myrcella is seen off. Tyrion scolds him and Ser Boros for losing track of her:

&gt;“Ser Mandon, you were her shield.”  
Ser Mandon Moore remained untroubled. “When they mobbed the Hound, I thought first of the king.”  
[...]  
Tyrion had stomached all he cared to. “The Others take your fucking cloaks! *Take them off* if you’re afraid to wear them, you bloody oaf . . . but *find me Sansa Stark* or I swear, I’ll have Shagga split that ugly head of yours in two to see if there’s anything inside but black pudding.”

^(ACOK 41: TYRION IX)

Based on the above quotes it's possible Ser Mandon had a grudge with Tyrion and decided to take matters into his own hands on the Blackwater. However, I don't think Ser Mandon is the type to make such a bold move against someone in the royal family by himself. Also, this option presents the least literary significance and it seems superfluous to me if no one else is behind it.

***

##CERSEI

Clearly Cersei had the motives to kill Tyrion. In general there was little love lost between the two, he had recently taken Tommen hostage, sent away Myrcella to Dorne, and she believed him to be her *valonquar*.

Tyrion himself believes her to be the clear choice:

&gt;*Cersei must have paid him to see that I never came back from the battle. Why else? I never did Ser Mandon any harm that I know of.* Tyrion touched his face, plucking at the proud flesh with blunt thick fingers. *Another gift from my sweet sister.*

^(ACOK 67: TYRION XV)

&gt;Here in Maegor’s Holdfast, every servant was in the queen’s pay, so any visitor might be another of Cersei’s catspaws, sent to finish the work Ser Mandon had begun.  
[...]  
“[...] I’ve been here twice, and found you dead to the world.”  
“Not dead. Though my sweet sister did try.” Perhaps he should not have said that aloud, but Tyrion was past caring. Cersei was behind Ser Mandon’s attempt to kill him, he knew that in his gut.

^(ASOS 4: TYRION I)

However, there are a few reasons I think Cersei isn't the optimal choice:

* If it was Cersei, it's odd that she never laments about her failed assassination attempt in her later POVs. Especially considering how often Tyrion comes up in her thoughts.
* For these mystery assassination attempts, it's almost never the person who it is openly or intitially suspected to be. Cersei was suspected for Jon Arryn's murder and it turned out to be Lysa and Littlefinger. Tyrion and/or Cersei were suspected for Bran's assassination attempt and it turned out to be Joffrey.
* The three Kingsguard she felt were in her pocket were Boros Blount, Meryn Trant, and Osmund Kettleblack. It's odd she would choose Mandon Moore as her catspaw, who notably had no allegiance to anyone.

Even Tyrion found it odd that Cersei used Ser Mandon instead of the other three:

&gt;He’d known that Ser Meryn and Ser Boros were his sister’s, and Ser Osmund later, but he had let himself believe that the others were not wholly lost to honor.

^(ACOK 67: TYRION XV)

Additionally, when Lancel reports to Cersei about the state of the battle, she tells him to report it Tyrion as if she expects him to still be alive:

&gt;When Ser Lancel Lannister told the queen that the battle was lost, she turned her empty wine cup in her hands and said, “Tell my brother, ser.” Her voice was distant, as if the news were of no great interest to her.

^(ACOK 62: SANSA VII)

Also, if Cersei wanted Tyrion dead, killing him while he's protecting the city and her own family seems ill-timed even for her. But if not Cersei than who?

***

##WHO ELSE?

Tyrion certainly had his fair share of enemies beyond just Cersei. Any number of people had motive to kill him:

* **Tywin** - General dislike and to keep Tyrion from inheriting Casterly Rock.
* **Joffrey** - He's a royal cunt and Tyrion wasn't his favorite person.
* **Pycelle** - Tyrion clipped his chain, snipped his beard, and threw him in the black cells.

I don't think it was any of the people above. Tywin was off warring and it seems odd to appoint Tyrion as Hand to fix things only to have him killed at a point of uncertainty.  Pycelle was locked in a dungeon and had no relationship with Ser Mandon we know of. Joffrey could've certainly ordered Ser Mandon, and as dutiful as Mandon is he may have complied. There's no real evidence for or against it being Joffrey, I just find it a boring and uninspired choice. Also, Joffrey was shitting in his pants from fear during the battle and he not have wanted Tyrion dead at that particular moment, because he seemed to be the only one keeping it all together.

That leaves two people who generally seem to be behind everything...

***

##VARYS

We know Varys's motivation at this point in the story was to weaken the realm so that Aegon can more easily conquer it. He later kills Kevan for being too competent a Hand and arguably manipulated the circumstances for Tyrion to kill Tywin for the same reasons. Perhaps he wanted to kill Tyrion on the Blackwater for being a competent Hand as well.

From the first quote above we see that Tyrion suspects Varys knows more than he is telling about Ser Mandon. There is also the line about how Varys ""gave him [Tyrion] a slimy smile and watched him sharply"". So if Varys knows more than he is telling, why is he keeping it from Tyrion unless he is the one responsible?

One explanation is that even if Varys knows it was Littlefinger, it serves his own interests to allow Tyrion to think it is Cersei. It's clear from what happens later that Varys is grooming Tyrion to become an asset to use for Aegon's benefit. So letting Tyrion think Cersei tried to kill him only furthers Varys's agenda by having Tyrion feel alienated from his family and more likely to turn on them.

Varys had seemingly no relationship with Ser Mandon, but Varys is an information broker, so he possibly leveraged something against him. I suppose it comes down to whether you think Varys really wanted Tyrion dead. I'm of the opinion that he was grooming Tyrion to play on his side the second he stepped into King's Landing, and I don't think he wanted to do away with a piece as valuable as him quite yet.

Which brings us to...

***

##LITTLEFINGER

Ser Mandon was brought to King's Landing from the Vale along with Jon Arryn. Littlefinger was also brought to court by Jon Arryn at the same time, so it stands to reason that Littlefinger and Ser Mandon had a relationship of some kind. Varys says about Ser Mandon that ""Lord Arryn brought him to King’s Landing and Robert gave him his white cloak, **but neither loved him much**"". If Jon Arryn didn't even like Ser Mandon it's quite possible he came into Jon Arryn's service by the reccomendation of someone else, that someone else perhaps being Littlefinger.

Littlefinger was in Bitterbridge for much of the time leading up to the Blackwater, so it raises the question of whether he could've gotten word to Ser Mandon to kill Tyrion. Based on how he was able to communicate instructions to Sansa via Dontos in ASOS, we can assume he could've gotten word to Ser Mandon. If not through Dontos than through one of the Kettleblacks, one of whom (Osmund) is even on the Kingsguard with Ser Mandon.

But what was Littlefinger's motive? In AGOT Littlefinger tells Catelyn he lost his dragonbone-hilt Valyrian dagger (the same one used by Bran's would-be assassin) in a bet to Tyrion. This turned out to be a lie. The truth was that Tyrion lost the dagger in a bet to Robert, and it was Joffrey who gave the dagger to the assassin. It is this lie that cause Catelyn to arrest Tyrion on the Kingsroad.

When Tyrion arrives in King's Landing as Hand the issue of the dagger comes up with Littlefinger:

&gt;“That’s a handsome knife as well.”  
“Is it?” There was mischief in Littlefinger’s eyes. He drew the knife and glanced at it casually, as if he had never seen it before. “Valyrian steel, and a dragonbone hilt. A trifle plain, though. It’s yours, if you would like it.”  
“Mine?” Tyrion gave him a long look. “No. I think not. Never mine.” *He knows, the insolent wretch. He knows and he knows that I know, and he thinks that I cannot touch him.*

^(ACOK 17: TYRION IV)

Protecting this lie could be one motive for Littlefinger to kill Tyrion, however he doesn't seem overly concerned about it. The fact that he continues to carry the dagger on his person in front of Tyrion almost seems like he's taunting him. The real lie Littlefinger is trying to protect comes later in the conversation:

&gt;“Lysa is more tractable than Catelyn, true . . . but also more fearful, and I understand she hates you.”  
“She believes she has good reason. When I was her guest in the Eyrie, she insisted that I’d murdered her husband, and was not inclined to listen to denials.” He leaned forward. “If I gave her Jon Arryn’s true killer, she might think more kindly of me.”  
**That made Littlefinger sit up**. “True killer? I confess, you make me curious. Who do you propose?”  
It was Tyrion’s turn to smile. “Gifts I give my friends, freely. Lysa Arryn would need to understand that.”

^(ACOK 17: TYRION IV)

Littlefinger is rarely taken by surprise and I think Tyrion truly rattled him here. The irony is that Tyrion thought it was Pycelle that poisoned Jon Arryn, not Littlefinger. Later Littlfinger seems pissed when he discovers Tyrion lied to him about the Myrcella-Sweetrobin bethrothal:

&gt;“I love you as much as I ever have, my lord. Though I do not relish being played for a fool. If Myrcella weds Trystane Martell, she can scarcely wed Robert Arryn, can she?”  
“Not without causing a great scandal,” he admitted. “I regret my little ruse, Lord Petyr, but when we spoke, I could not know the Dornishmen would accept my offer.”  
Littlefinger was not appeased. “I do not like being lied to, my lord. Leave me out of your next deception.”

^(ACOK 25: TYRION VI)

Given this it's clear that Littlefinger had motive, means, and oppurtunity. I think he is the likeliest candidate to have urged Ser Mandon to kill Tyrion on the Blackwater. It's even possible Littlefinger plotted for Tyrion to be the patsy for Joffrey's murder later on, thus making it the third time he's sought to undermine Tyrion.

This is more of a thought exercise than a knock against the parents. Arya is a great name and a fabulous character, but who she will be when the book ends is anyone's guess. The idea came to mind when some friends of mine named their baby Dexter. Dexter is another great name, but the immediate connotation is of a serial killer, which is really weird conflict when you see baby pictures. 

So, back to the point, Arya is facing a fairly dark path with her trajectory. She is driven by revenge more so than any of the other Stark children, and while becoming an assassin sounds cool, it places her on the board to wreck havoc with people's emotions. What if Arya is dispatched to kill Daenerys, or performs some other dastardly act in TWOW or TDOS?

**4. Where Do We Go From Here?** What will happen now that Jaqen (if that is his real name), Sarella Sand, and Sam the Slayer are all in the Citadel? Will dragons become a full species once more, or will the maesters succeed in extinguishing the last flames of magic?

-------------------------------------------

##1. The Maester's Conspiracy/Faceless Men

I'm sure most of you have a pretty good understanding of this theory, and it is one of the generally accepted theories (up there with R+L=J and Frey pies). Basically, the theory states that the Maesters have been working since their inception to rid the world of magic.

We will first start off with the cause of magic in the universe of ASOIAF. From the ASOIAF wiki, ""Dragons are believed to be intrinsically tied to magic and the seasons of the world. Since dragons became extinct from Westeros, the power of magic dwindled and winters grew colder."" Even if they aren't directly caused, there is a correlation between dragons and magic.

So eliminating dragons might eliminate magic, right?

Well, we know that the largest dragon known to man was Balerion the Black Dread, Aegon I Targaryen's black dragon who burnt Harrenhal to a crisp (ASOS Chapter 8, Daenerys I). Since then, dragons grew smaller and smaller. After the Dance of Dragons, the species became somewhat endangered. Many people believe(d) this to be the confinement of dragons in pits.

Here's the proof that that is wrong. After killing the Meereenese girl Hazzea, Viserion and Rhaegal are confined and chained in the Great Pyramid, which is a makeshift Dragon Pit (ADWD Chapter 11, Daenerys II). It should have the same effect, right? Wrong. Later, when she first visits the dragon pit, she realizes that Viserion has grown larger despite confinement.

So we know that there was another reason for the dragons becoming weaker and stronger. The theory that dragons were supposed to live free in the skies instead of chains, however, was created by the maesters. For being very knowledgeable, they were pretty far from the mark.

Now that we have a little bit of suspicion, let's cast a deeper look at the maesters. The following is a conversation between Lady Dustin and Theon (as Reek) in ADWD (Chapter 37, stylistically titled 'The Prince of Winterfell'):

&gt; As Maester Medrick went to one knee to whisper in Bolton's ear, Lady Dustin's mouth twisted in distate. ""If I were queen, the first thing  I would do would be to kill all those grey rats. They scurry everywhere, living on the leavings of the lords, chittering to one another, whispering in the ears of their masters. But who are the masters and who are the servants, truly? 

&gt; ""Every great lord has his maester, ever lesser lord aspires to one. If you do not have a maester, it is taken to mean that you are of little consequence. The grey rats read and write our letters, even for such lords as cannot read themselves, and who can say for a certainty that they are not twisting the words for their own ends? What good are they, I ask you?""

&gt;""They heal,"" said Theon. It seemed to be expected of him.

&gt; ""They heal, yes. I never said they were not subtle. They tend to us when we are sick and injured, or distraught over the illness of a parent or child. Whenever we are weakest and most vulnerable, there they are.

&gt; ""Sometimes they heal us, and we are duly grateful. When they fail, they console us in our grief, and we are grateful for that as well. Out of gratitude we give them a place beneath our roof and make them privy to all our shames and secrets, a part of every council. And before too long, the ruler has become the ruled.

**Here's where it gets important**

&gt; ""That was how it was with Lord Rickard Stark. Maester Walys was his grey rat's name. And isn't it clever how the maesters only go by one name, even those who had two when they first arrived at the Citadel? That way we cannot know who they truly are or where they come from...but if you are dogged enough, you can still find out.

&gt; ""Before he had forged his chain, Maester Walys had been known as Walyn Flowers. Flowers, Hill, Rivers, Snow...we give such names to baseborn children to mark them for what they are, but they are always quick to shed them. Walys Flowers had a Hightower girl for a mother...and an archmaester of the Cidatel for a father, it was rumored. The grey rats are not as chaste as they would have us believe. Oldtown maesters are the worst of all.

&gt; ""Once he forged his chain, his secret father and his friends wasted no time dispatching him to Winterfell to fill Lord Rickard's ears with poisoned words as sweet as honey. The Tully marriage was his notion, never doubt it, he -"" She broke off as Roose Bolton rose to his feet, pale eyes shining in the torchlight.

I believe there is another, more damning, scene between Theon and Dustin, but I'm not going to waste so much space copying it. Basically the jist of her story is that the maesters were responsible for setting Robert's Rebellion into motion, even if Rhaegar was the spark that lit the kindling they were building.

So what's the point of destabilizing the realm and possibly unseating the Targaryens? I don't think we know that yet. But it still fits in with the idea of the maesters being more than they seem.

I think the final piece of evidence leads into the next topic easily. The fact that the archmaesters of the Citadel are conspiring, to the point where prospective maesters who cannot be used as pawns sufficiently are excluded from this conspiracy.

From AFFC's prologue:

&gt; Armen pursed his lips in disapproval. ""Marwyn is unsound. Archmaester Perestan would be the first to tell you that.""

&gt; ""Archmaester Ryam says too,"" said Roone.

&gt; Leo yawned. ""The sea is wet, the sun is warm, and the menagerie hates the mastiff.""

Moments later, Pate has a thought about Marwyn.

&gt; The Mage was not like other maesters. People said that he kept company with whores and hedge wizards, talked with hairy Ibbenese and pitch-black Summer Islanders in their own tongues, and sacrificed to queer gods at the little sailors' temples down by the wharves. Men spoke of seeing him in the undercity, in rat pits and black brothels, consorting with mummers, singers, sellswords, even beggars. Some even whispered that he once killed a man with his fists.

&gt; When Marwyn had returned to Oldtown after *spending eight years to the east mapping distant lands* (aside: not sure if this is significant at all, but this reminds me of a certain Crow's Eye being MIA for a while in the east. It doesn't contribute to the theory, but I just want to point it out) searching for lost books, and studying with warlocks and shadowbinders, Vinegar Vaellyn had dubbed him ""Marwyn the Mage."" The name was soon over Oldtown, to Vaellyn's vast annoyance. ""Leave spells and prayers to priests and septons and bend you wits to learning truths a man can trust in,"" Archmaester Ryam had once counseled Pete, but Ryam's ring and rod and mask were yellow gold, and his maester's chai had no link of Valyrian Steel.

The Valyrian steel link alludes to higher mysteries - prophecy, magic, etc. So far, we see Marwyn, who has traveled far and wide, possibly even to Asshai and Valyria and other magical places, who believes in magic, versus the archmaesters who deny any truth. We've already seen magic, so we know whose right, but this sets up an important dynamic, where the correct person is thought of as somewhat of a conspiracy theorist.

Later, in Sam's last chapter, he is talking to Alleras (suspected to be Sarella Sand), Marwyn, and Pate (suspected to be Jaqen H'gar, but I'll get to that later):

&gt; ""Aemon would have gone to [Daenerys] if he had the strength. He wanted us to send a maester to her, to counsel her and protect her and fetch her safely home.""

&gt; ""Did he?"" Archmaester Marwyn shrugged. ""Perhapes it's good that he died before he got to Oldtown. Elsewise, the [archmaesters] might have had to kill him, and that would have made the poor old dears wring their wrinkled hands.""

&gt; ""Kill him?"" Sam said, shocked. ""Why?""

&gt; ""If I tell you, they may need to kill you too."" Marwyn smiled a ghastly smile, the juice of fthe sourleaf running red between his teeth. ""Who do you think killed all the dragons the last time around? Gallant dragonslayers armed with swords?"" He spat. ""The world of the Citadel is building has no place in it for sorcery or prophecy or glass candles, much less for dragons. Ask yourself why Aemon Targaryen was allowed to waste his life upon the Wall, when by rights, he should have been raised to archmaester. His *blood* was why. He could not be trusted. **No more than I can.**""

&gt; ""What will you do?"" asked Alleras, the Sphinx.

&gt; ""Get myself to Slaver's Bay, in Aemon's place. The grey sheep will send their man on a galley, I don't doubt. With fair winds I should reach her first."" Marwyn glanced at Sam again and frowned. ""You...you should stay and forge your chain. If I were you, I would do it quickly. A time will come when you'll be needed on the Wall."" He turned to [Pate].

[A Dragonfly Necklace](https://img0.etsystatic.com/000/0/5643720/il_570xN.337924312.jpg), worn in Season 1 (above) and recurring in [Season 2](http://www.spoilertv.co.uk/images/cache/game-of-thrones/season-2/Cast%20Promotional%20Photos/Sansa-Stark-Sophie-Turner-Helen-Sloan%5B1%5D_FULL.jpg) and [Season 3](http://static.wetpaint.me/network/ROOT/photos/310/gameofthrones1305-222806006636273898.jpg)

This recurring piece of jewelry got me thinking, as nothing in a TV show on the scale of GoT is done randomly, including the wardrobe.  Sansa's hair style for example, gets progressively less 'Southron' in style the more she is disillusioned with the South.

Anyway, the only reference to dragonflies in ASOIAF is Prince Duncan ""the Small"" Targaryen, son of Aegon ""Egg"" V, who ends up being called the Prince of Dragonflies and is famous for giving up his crown in order to marry his love Jenny of Oldstones.  

Interestingly, one of the two times these characters are mentioned in ASOIAF is at Oldstones, the ruin of an ancient River King keep, in a Catelyn POV.

&gt;""Oldstones, all the smallfolk called it when I was a girl, but no doubt it had some other name when it was still a hall of kings."" She had camped here once withher father, on their way to Seagard. *Petyr was with us too...*

&gt;""There's a song,"" he [Robb] remembered. ""Jenny of Oldstones, with the flowers in her hair.""

&gt;""We're all just songs in the end. If we are lucky."" She had played at being Jenny that day, had even wound flowers in her hair. And Petyr had pretended to be her Prince of Dragonflies. Catelyn could not have been more than twelve, Petyr just a boy.

Now let us flash back to when Sansa first met Littlefinger at the Tourney of the Hand.  In the books she has just won the flower from Ser Loras.  In the TV series she is wearing her dragonfly necklace.

&gt;When Sansa finally looked up, a man was standing over her, staring.  He was short, wit a pointed beard and a silver streak in his hair, almost as old as her father. ""You must be one of her daughters,"" he said to her. He had grey-green eyes that did not smile when his mouth did. ""You have the Tully Look.""

&gt;""I'm Sansa Stark,"" she said, ill a ease. The man wore a heavy cloack with a fur collar, fastened with a silver mockingbird, and he had the effortless manner of a high lord, but she did not know him. ""I have not had the honor, my lord.""

&gt;Septa Mordane quickly took a hand. ""Sweet child, this is Lord Petyr Baelish, of the king's small council.""

&gt;""Your mother was *my* queen of beauty once,"" the man said quietly. His breath smelled of mint. ""You have her hair."" His fingers brushed against her cheek as he stroken one auburn lock. Quite abruptly he turned and walked away.

Creepiness aside, I feel there is something deeper going on here than meets the eye.  Littlefinger firsts notices Sansa here, having just received a flower from the Knight of Flowers.  She is twelve years old, the same age as when Petyr and Catelyn first played as the Prince of Dragonflies and Jenny of Oldstones when they were children.  He remark on her ""Tully look"" and that she has the same hair as her mother.

People often remark how Littlefinger has an obvious and uncomfortable attraction to Sansa, likely due to her resemblance to Catelyn, the only woman he has ever loved.  Yet I think it's more than that.  I think Littlefinger is actually in love with Sansa.  Before the events of AGOT, Littlefinger hadn't seen Catelyn since the ill-fated duel with Brandon Stark.  His entire image and love for her was formed around the Catelyn he had grown up with; a pretty, naive, highborn lady with auburn hair and a love for songs.  Then twenty years later, along comes Sansa, who is in every way the splitting image of the Catelyn of his youth.  This explains why his introduction to Sansa was far less smooth than suits Littlefinger; he is in shock.  He speaks to her quietly and abruptly leaves after stroking her hair.

I believe Petyr first fell in love with Cat at Oldstones.  Catelyn was ""no more than twelve"" and they had played as lovers in a song.  It was announced that Catelyn was betrothed to Brandon Stark when she was twelve, so presumably later that year.  That announcement would have shattered the illusion created by a naive Petyr at Oldstones, yet his love for Cat would already be in place, leading him to constantly try to seduce her.

[ADWD](/s ""Littlefinger never stopped loving ""only Cat"", as evidenced by his murder of Lysa, but it was only the Catelyn of his youth.  Yet now Sansa has filled the place of his love.  Quite fitting that she was present for the murder of the Lady of the Vale, as it set up the events to eventually make her Lady of the Vale.  Littlefinger showed his true love and motivation then.  This also explains why we see no signs of distress from him regarding the death of Catelyn at the Twins.  Sansa is his Cat and he had no need for the mature, intelligent woman Catelyn had become."")

Yet what does this have to do with the Prince of Dragonflies?  Well, as mentioned before there is strong imagery linking the two.  Littlefinger first comments on Sansa's hair as soon as she was given a rose from the Knight of Flowers, tentatively linked to Jenny of Oldstones' flower in her hair.  In GoT Sansa is often wearing the dragonfly necklace.  It is also fitting that diminutive Petyr Baelish, nicknamed ""Littlefinger"" is parallel to Duncan, who was nicknamed ""the small"".

This gives a possible hint to the downfall of Littlefinger.  Duncan the Small gave up his crown for his love of Jenny of Oldstones.  It hints that Littlefinger, the most ambitious individual in ASOIAF would cast aside all the power he has gained, lose his ""crown"", for his love.  Petyr had already been willing to risk everything for his love for Catelyn by dueling Brandon.

Finally there is a beautiful, yet sad irony to this eventuality.  From AGOT there is a strong contrast between the cunning Littlefinger, who see's the world as players and pieces, and the naive Sansa, who see's the world in songs.  Yet If Littlefinger's love for Catelyn/Sansa is his downfall, his downfall would be a repeat of the Prince of Dragonflies.  The most cunning man in the Seven Kingdoms would fall because of a song, the song to which he fell in love.

His pack of vicious dogs that Ramsay uses to hunt people.  Here is the text I've found regarding the dogs.  They are mentioned in almost every Theon POV, most of the time indicating that Theon and the dogs get along really well.

&gt;""They were just outside the camp when the baying of a pack of hounds told of Lord Ramsay’s approach. Whoresbane was with him, along with half a dozen of his favorites, Skinner and Sour Alyn and Damon Dance-for-Me, and the Walders Big and Little too. The dogs swarmed around them, snapping and snarling at the strangers. The Bastard’s girls, Reek thought, before he remembered that one must never, never, never use that word in Ramsay’s presence.""
_____________________________________
&gt;""The dogs were on him before he could puzzle out which, drawn to his scent. The dogs were fond of Reek; he slept with them oft as not, and sometimes Ben Bones let him share their supper. The pack raced across the flagstones barking, circling him, jumping up to lick his filthy face, nipping at his legs. Helicent caught his left. hand between her teeth and worried it so fiercely Reek feared he might lose two more fingers. Red Jeyne slammed into his chest and knocked him off his feet. She was lean, hard muscle, where Reek was loose, grey skin and brittle bones, a white-haired starveling.""
_____________________________________
&gt;""He would eat later, off whatever scraps Lord Ramsay thought to send him. The dogs enjoyed the run of the hall, however, and provided the night’s best entertainment, when Maude and Grey Jeyne tore into one of Lord Stout’s hounds over an especially meaty bone that Will Short had tossed them. Reek was the only man in the hall who did not watch the three dogs fight. He kept his eyes on Ramsay Bolton.""

&gt;""The fight did not end until their host’s dog was dead. Stout’s old hound never stood a mummer’s chance. He had been one against two, and Ramsay’s bitches were young, strong, and savage. Ben Bones, who liked the dogs better than their master, had told Reek they were all named after peasant girls Ramsay had hunted, raped, and killed back when he’d still been a bastard, running with the first Reek. “The ones who give him good sport, anywise. The ones who weep and beg and won’t run don’t get to come back as bitches.” The next litter to come out of the Dreadfort’s kennels would include a Kyra, Reek did not doubt. “He’s trained ’em to kill wolves as well,” Ben Bones had confided. Reek said nothing. He knew which wolves the girls were meant to kill, but he had no wish to watch the girls fighting over his severed toe.""
_____________________________________
&gt;""The best he could hope for was to be returned to the kennels with Ramsay’s girls for company. Kyra, he remembered. The new bitch he calls Kyra.""
_____________________________________
&gt;""Inside, the cooks were ladling out beef-and-barley stew, thick with carrots and onions, served in trenchers hollowed from loaves of yesterday’s bread. Scraps were thrown onto the floor to be gobbled up by Ramsay’s girls and the other dogs.
_____________________________________
&gt;""The girls were glad to see him. They knew him by his smell. Red Jeyne loped over to lick at his hand, and Helicent slipped under the table and curled up by his feet, gnawing at a bone. They were good dogs. It was easy to forget that every one was named for a girl that Ramsay had hunted and killed.""
_____________________________________
&gt;""It was madness. Ramsay would hunt him down, with the girls. Red Jeyne and Jez and Helicent would tear him to pieces if the gods were good. Or worse, he might be taken back alive. “I have to remember my name,” he whispered.""
_____________________________________
&gt;""The bone was beyond him, though, so he tossed it to the dogs and watched Grey Jeyne make off with it whilst Sara and Willow snapped at her heels.""

Theon is building a very trusting relationship with Ramsay's dogs. To the point where they consider him part of their pack.  Even mean-spirited dogs will protect their own pack.

My best guess (with a lot of details left out) is that we're going to see Ramsay tracking Theon with his dogs.  After he finds Theon and ""Arya"" it's probably going to look like Theon is fucked beyond all help.  Ramsay starts beating him badly but the dogs are going to protect their pack.

It is not hard to see why this is always referenced. It's gross, it's clunky, it's awkward; there's no grace to it, and even the image it conjures up is absurd. It is about as antithetical to sexy and/or exciting as writing can be. If GRRM was trying to write a good, decent, or even non-goofy sex scene, it would be terrible writing. 

Thing is, he's not. He's writing a Sam sex scene, particularly the one where he loses his virginity. These books are written in tight omniscient, so the narration is filtered through the perspective of the Pov character in question. Martin's goal, then, prosewise, is not to string together an ornate or evocative series of words. He's not a poet. What he's (ideally) trying to do is convey a particular emotion that syncs with whatever the character is currently feeling.

So: Sam is an awkward fat kid who on some subconscious level has probably long since chalked up his odds of getting laid to a firm 0%. Suddenly, boom -- he's about to fuck Gilly. Losing your virginity is some awk shit. Probably going to be in very heightened state of self-awareness; take into account this is Sam who probably does not have stellar self esteem regardless of his recent strengthening up.

So Sam looks down and his...equipment looks like a ""fat pink mast"". That's a pretty ludicrous image, like I said above. It's the opposite of hot. It's awkward. It's impersonal -- Sam dissociates himself from his own body, the sort of stupefied reaction you might expect from a shy dude with no-sexing vows suddenly thrust into sex.  ""Fat pink mast"" is also borderline asexual: it's about as far from an erotic image as you can get. This too is reflective of Sam's experience of the situation. It isn't erotic or ""hot"" for him: it's shocking and disruptive, even if dude is enjoying and goin' with it on a visceral level.

Basically, yes -- it's clumsy and gross and not erotic at all. That's the point. That's how Sam is experiencing the whole thing. It makes you cringe? Feel awkward? Good. That's the point.

Well yeah anyway there's my several hundred word thesis expounding on a grotesque genitalia analogy. It turns out there are always deeper and darker levels of AsoIaF fandom.

Side note: partially this in depth discussion of GRRM peen metaphors is from hitting max level insanity waiting between books, but part of it is because I've been writing for a long time myself, so stuff like this is a fun exercise to hopefully expand my own awareness of it.

I hope this post can get enough visibility that this misconception occurs a little less often. 

When Dany walks into Drogo's funeral pyre, and is unharmed, it is the result of blood magic, not some godly immunity to fire. GRRM states this in an interview [here](http://astralgia.com/webportfolio/sfzine/chats/transcripts/031899.html) as follows:

&gt;**Granny**:	 Do Targaryens become immune to fire once they ""bond"" to their dragons?
&gt;
**George_RR_Martin**:	 Granny, thanks for asking that. It gives me a chance to clear up a common misconception. TARGARYENS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO FIRE! The birth of Dany's dragons was unique, magical, wonderous, a miracle. She is called The Unburnt because she walked into the flames and lived. But her brother sure as hell wasn't immune to that molten gold.

So no, R+L=J is not bust because Jon is burned fighting the wight. Even Dany is aware she is not immune to fire because when she jumps into the pit with drogon she fears being burned (and in her later chapters of ADWD, she remarks on being burned). 

&gt; I am looking into hell, but I dare not look away. She had never been so certain of anything. If I run from him, he will burn me and devour me.

Given other scenes in the book, such as Dany sinking into scalding hot water, it is possible Tararyen's have some resistance to heat, but are certainly not immune to fire.

Her story has to be one of the most sickening and sad in all of Westeros.

Born in Winterfell she is the Steward's daughter, who mingles with highborn girls, Sansa and Arya. She ends up befriending Sansa and the two of them become best of friends. She was delighted to hear she'd be moving to King's Landing with Sansa, and she develops a crush on Lord Dandarrion at the Hand's Tourney. Blessed with good looks and good luck, Jeyne must have thought herself the luckiest girl in the world.

Things darken though. She sees ser Hugh of the Vale killed in front of her own eyes. The atmosphere at court changes. People are less friendly than before. Suddenly there is violence in the streets. Her father is murdered along with the majority of Stark forces. Her best friend is practically a prisoner, and Jeyne is forced into sexual slavery under Lord Baelish. 

Years pass and she's sent back north to be a fake queen. She's heard rumors about her betrothed, but nothing can compare her for what is about to happen. She sees Winterfell again, in ruins, the place that was once filled with laughter of her friends and family is now her prison. Ramsay whips and beats her. Forces her to perform sexual acts on his dogs and when the wedding night comes around, Theon, the Greyjoy ward she remembers from her childhood is forced to service her.

She's currently on her way to the wall. Frostbite has taken half her nose, Ramsay has taken half of the flesh off her back, and the Game of Thrones has taken her identity and family.

This is why I love these books so much. In that one story alone, you could write a novel or a TV series, but she's just one minor character in a universe so detailed and descriptive.

So, i've been a fan of the series for a long time, I'm a founding member of the Brotherhood Without Banners, and the guy who originated the tradition of George knighting his fans at WorldCon. And this is a story - a tragedy, really, about another fan and who George honored him.

You might have noticed ""House Manwoody of Kingsgrave"" in the books. They're a minor house and it's kind of a weird name, and their symbol is a white skull wearing a gold crown on a black field. They're named after one of the nicest guys I ever met, a member of the BWB who was very active in the community, and incredibly accomplished. His name was Michael - I'll leave his last name out of it for reasons that will become clear.

Way back in 2001 the World Science Fiction Convention was in Philadelphia, and that's where I first met George and the other members of what became the BWB. We had a riotous weekend together, started a lot of traditions that are still going strong, and forged a bond of friendship that has lasted. Michael lived in Australia but, but was an active member and mod on the ASOIAF boards that were, and still are, the center of AGOT fandom. The next year he got a very prestigious post teaching international law at Penn. That's when I met him, and he was a great guy, incredibly knowledgeable and with impeccable taste, but not a scrap of pretension in him.

He had a gift for teaching people about the things he loved - running, fine single-malt scotch, opera - without condescending. We went out for drinks once and when I confessed I didn't ""get"" whiskey, he immediately ordered up a storm and talked me through every nuance and flavor of each single malt. It started a lifelong love of good scotch for me. Anyway, Manwoody (his name on the board) had the same effect on everyone, and as a Falstaffian lover-of-life, George Martin admired him too. Every year at WorldCon we got together, the whole gang. One year, Manwoody told us he was doing the ""Grand Tour"" in fine style before returning home to Australia. He traipsed all over Europe, visiting distilleries and opera festivals, and writing a series of opera criticisms that were published and are still well regarded.

And then he went home and killed himself. We were all stunned. Stunned. Here was a man at the very top of his game - widely admired and with an impressive career as well as avocation. And it turns out he had been diagnosed with a terminal, degenerative neurological condition that he had watched turn his father from a vibrant man to helpless vegetable. So rather than do the same, and impose another burden of care on his mother and sister, he went out at the height of his powers.

We were shattered. Shattered. George was too. And so in his honor, House Manwoody are from Kingsgrave. It was this time of year when the news broke, and so I thought to pass on the story of a great guy, and the author who memorialized him. Tonight I'll have a scotch in his honor.

Edit: A few people pointed out that the first appearance of the Manwoodys was in 2000, three years before Lord Manwoody's death in 2003. I followed up with other people who are in the know, and I was wrong - Michael did take his name from the books, not the reverse. However, a character named after and in honor of him exists 'in canon' and will appear soon; this straight from the horse's mouth. This isn't quite as touching, I'm afraid, as the story as I understood it. No purposeful deception occurred on my part, and I apologize for the confusion. Many other people had precisely the same recollection that I did, and we're all surprised.

As it turns out Catelyn was supposed to be taken alive as a prisoner, and thus would have lived in captivity in the Twins, apparently.

Introduction
-

About a month ago, I did a series of posts on Robb Stark as a military commander ([Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1hibqm/spoilers_all_a_complete_analysis_of_robb_stark_as/), [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1hkxrb/spoilers_all_a_complete_analysis_of_robb_stark_as/), [Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1i0dz2/spoilers_all_a_complete_analysis_of_robb_stark_as/)), and I figured that the next character from the series that I wanted to analyze militarily was **Stannis Baratheon.** I'm going to try to accomplish it in 3 parts. Part 1 will be looking at Stannis's military accomplishments in the events leading up the books, part 2 will deal with the War of the Five Kings and part 3 will be an analysis/speculation post on how all this combined information may play out in the upcoming Battle in the Ice. 

Stannis Baratheon is a favorite among fans of the series (though much less popular among the in-story characters from ASOIAF). Fans seem to love his [dust-dry wit](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1joh46/spoilers_all_lets_take_a_minute_to_recognise_this/), redemption arc and generally honorable persona, but an aspect of his character that doesn't get as much mention is his role as a military commander. Stannis is one of the most experienced military commanders in the series. More than experienced, Stannis is a *good* battlefield commander. 

In fact, I believe that **through a good grasp on strategy and an even better understanding of tactics, Stannis Baratheon is the most well-rounded military commander in Westeros.**

Iron Will: The Siege of Storm’s End
-
&gt; “I held Storm's End for him, watching good men starve while Mace Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne feasted within sight of my walls. Did Robert thank me? No. He thanked Stark, for lifting the siege when we were down to rats and radishes. I built a fleet at Robert’s command, took Dragonstone in his name.” – *ACOK, Prologue*

The second-born son of Lord Steffon Baratheon and Cassana Estermont, Stannis was a serious child who became only more dour with the death of his parents. When his older brother, Robert, rebelled against the Iron Throne, Stannis reluctantly joined with the rebels. Robert tasked Stannis with holding Storm's End while he marched the majority of his forces west. When Robert was defeated at the Battle of Ashford by the Mace Tyrell (actually Randyll Tarly), it cleared Targaryen loyalist forces to move on Storm's End. The Tyrell army set up camp outside of the walls of Storm's End while the royal fleet led by Paxter Redwyne closed off Shipbreaker Bay.

A lesser leader would have capitulated; a lesser leader would have sought honorable terms for surrender, but Stannis did nothing of the sort. His orders were to hold the castle, and he did so at great expense. Here, Stannis demonstrates two aspects of leadership that defined his character as a commander: **personal courage** and **loyalty**. He would suffer death before disobeying the orders that his brother had given him. 

**Aside**: More than a few people have asked why Stannis inspires such loyalty among his soldiers. I think the answer comes through the fact that he himself endured the same hardships as his soldiers. Oftentimes, if a commander or leader is 'down in the mud' with his troops, his troops will be fiercely loyal and emulate that commander. The fact that there was only one attempt to defect (by Ser Gawen Wylde) speaks to this.

Despite being cut off from the world, Stannis held. He refused to surrender for *an entire year*. At death's door, only the timely arrival of Davos's onion and salt fish kept the entire garrison from starving to death. And so, they continued to hold out against Mace Tyrell. 

Following the Battle of the Trident and the Sack of KL, Ned Stark moved his army to relieve the siege of Storm's End. The Tyrells dipped their banners at the news of the results of the Trident and the approach of Ned Stark and swore fealty to Robert Baratheon. 

It is not explicitly stated that Stannis knew how important his task was, but I'd like to think that Stannis was keenly aware that his efforts tied up one of the largest contingents of Targaryen loyalist forces. I'd also like to think that he understood that simply holding Storm's End for honor's sake was not enough reason to hold it for an entire year. My guess is that Stannis saw the strategic value in holding the castle.

Robert was unjust in crediting Ned for winning the battle. In fact, Stannis's actions at Storm's end directly contributed to Robert's victory at the Trident. Here's how the wiki of ice and fire [puts it](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Siege_of_Storm%27s_End):

&gt; Stannis successfully holding the castle aided the rebellion as it meant the Tyrell host could not join Rhaegar Targaryen's army, which would have swelled the ranks of House Targaryen at the Battle of the Trident.
_____________

Amphibious Assault: Dragonstone
-

After holding Storm's End for a year, one would think that Stannis would be given a respite from war. But this was not to be the case. Stannis was then tasked to take Dragonstone, the traditional seat of Targaryen power. Utilizing part the turncloak fleet of Paxter Redwyne and building a brand new fleet for his brother, he prepared to invade Dragonstone. 

Although we don't know much about the particulars of the battle itself, we do know that he commanded the invasion of Dragonstone from the deck of his flagship, Fury (ACOK, Davos III). This gave Stannis the best command and control of his forces - perhaps the single-most important tactical aspect of leadership. We also know that Stannis was successful in seizing the island fortress from the last Targaryen hold-outs. But amphibious assaults coupled with sieges are among the most dangerous and difficult tasks an army and navy can perform. His utilization of [joint warfare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_warfare) was most likely key to winning the battle there. The fact that he was successful speaks volumes of his tactical adaptability as we do not have evidence he commanded a navy before. 

In fact, the only real 'black mark'  is that Viserys and Daenerys Targaryen escaped to Essos - a 'failure' that soured the already cold relationship between Robert and Stannis. But I tend to feel that Stannis is justified in having a grievance against Robert, who blamed him for the loss of the last two Targaryens.

&gt;  ""I built a fleet at Robert’s command, took Dragonstone in his name. Did he ever take my hand and say, Well done, brother, whatever should I do without you? No, he blamed me for letting Willem Darry steal away Viserys and the babe, as if I could have stopped it."" - *ACOK, Prologue*
__________

Shaping Operations: Fair Isle and Great Wyk
-

&gt; In the end the Golden Storm went down off Fair Isle during Balon’s first rebellion, cut in half by a towering war galley called Fury when Stannis Baratheon caught Victarion in his trap and smashed the Iron Fleet. – *AFFC, Chapter 1, The Prophet*

[Map of Greyjoy Rebellion]( http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/7/7a/Greyjoy_Rebellion.png)

Despite Robert and Stannis's differences, Robert gave Stannis the castle of Dragonstone either as a [slight or a signal of Stannis's role as heir](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/71313-was-granting-stannis-dragonstone-a-deliberate-insult-from-robert/). Additionally, Stannis became Master of Ships - most likely as a result of his naval actions on Dragonstone during Robert's Rebellion. 

But the peace that Robert's Rebellion ushered in did not last for long. Six years following the end of Robert's Rebellion, Balon Greyjoy declared the Iron Islands independent of the Iron Throne and crowned himself King of the Iron Islands. Not known for being the soundest strategic mind, Balon did have his reasons:

&gt; [Why did Balon Greyjoy rebel the first time?]

&gt; Yes. Obviously Balon was wrong, but he believed that Robert, as a usurper, might not have the strong support of the other lords the way that a Targaryen king would have. He also thought he could defeat Robert at sea. - [So Spake Martin, July 27, 2008](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Month/2008/07/)

The Greyjoys struck before Robert could assemble. Victarion Greyjoy and the Iron Fleet sailed into Lannisport and burned the Lannister fleet that was preparing to sail against the Greyjoys. This brazen surprise attack put the Iron Throne on defense. Ironborn raided the West and Rodrik Greyjoy laid siege to Seaguard. Basically, the Greyjoy rebellion got off to a great start, and it may have continued except for a certain Master of Ships.

Stannis, being the master of ships, joined the royal fleet with his former enemy, Paxter Redwyne and sailed north on the Sunset Sea. Off the coast of Fair Isle, he laid a trap for Victarion Greyjoy. Here's how Victarion remembers it:

&gt; The memory of Fair Isle still rankled in the iron captain's memory. Stannis Baratheon had descended on the Iron Fleet from both north and south whilst they were trapped in the channel between the island and the mainland, dealing Victarion his most crushing defeat. - *ADWD, Chapter 56, Victarion I* - (I am indebted to /u/Ailite and /u/kidcoda for pointing me in the right direction and quoting the text respectively. Thanks to you both!)

Stannis's careful selection of the point where the Iron Fleet was decisive in destroying the Ironborn's greatest advantage: seapower. With Ironborn seapower destroyed, Robert and his army could move easily into the Iron Islands and destroy the Greyjoy Rebellion.

Stannis performed what is known as a [shaping operation](http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/call/thesaurus/toc.asp?id=33756). Army Field Manual 3.0 defines a shaping operation as:

&gt; An operation at any echelon that creates and preserves conditions for the success of the decisive operation. Shaping operations establish conditions for the decisive operation through effects on the enemy, population (including local leaders), and terrain.

The actions of Stannis and his fleet cleared the Sunset Sea of the Iron Fleet and allowed for Robert and Ned to ferry soldiers into Pyke for the main assault against the base of Greyjoy power. And while Robert took Pyke, Stannis led the successful invasion of Great Wyck.

Conclusion
-

In all, Stannis's military record prior the events of the books is impeccable. His use of solid tactics to achieve strategic aims stands in contrast to those who were good at tactics but bad at strategy (Robb) or those who were bad at tactics, good at strategy (Tywin). In part 2 (which I hope to have done before the end of the week), we'll take a look at Stannis as a military commander during the War of the Five Kings with a particular focus on the Siege of King's Landing, the Battle of the Wall and the Battle of Deepwood Motte.

""I have won every battle, yet somehow I'm losing the war."" - Robb Stark, *ASOS, Chapter 14, Catelyn II*

First, two bald statements to kick this post off: 

- **Robb Stark was the greatest tactician during the War of the Five Kings.** 

and

- **Robb Stark was the worst strategist of the War of the Five Kings.** (Though Balon Grey gives Robb a run for his money for worst strategist.)

On the face of it, these two statements contradict each other, but in these posts, I will attempt to defend both of these statements with textual evidence and some non-technical references to military strategy. 

The Difference Between Tactics and Strategy
-

- **Strategy** - ""The employment of battles to gain the end of war."" - Clausewitz

- **Tactics** -  ""Tactics is the art and science of winning engagements and battles."" - *Marine Corps Doctrinal Publication - MCDP 1-3* 

Background
-
I'll keep this short as I'm sure most everyone here is familiar with the events in AGOT. Before he was King of the North, Robb Stark was a man on a rescue mission. When his father, Eddard Stark was imprisoned for attempting to overthrow Joffrey, Robb Stark called his banners and proceeded to march south in an attempt to save his father. Along the way, he met up with his two most influential advisers: Ser Brynden ""The Blackfish"" Tully and his mother Catelyn Stark at Moat Cailin. There, Robb informed his mother that the Lannisters split their forces. One group of Lannisters led by Jaimie Lannister defeated Lord Clement Piper and Lord Vance at the Golden Tooth and then defeated Edmure Tully outside of the walls of Riverrun. The other force, led by Lord Tywin Lannister, secured Harrenhal and raced north to the Green Fork.

The Residue of Design
-
&gt; “Luck?"" Drizzt replied. ""Perhaps. But more often, I dare to say, luck is simply the advantage a true warrior gains in executing the correct course of action.” - R.A. Salvatore, *The Halfling's Gem*

Let's address one thing from the start. **Robb Stark was a lucky son of a bitch.** But this luck came as a result of careful planning and good division of responsibilities *initially.* Robb Stark divided his army between his cavalry and his infantry.  The infantry he sent to the Green Fork to engage Tywin, the cavalry to relieve the siege at Riverrun. Therein lies the ruse. Robb needed Tywin to believe that he was committing his forces against Tywin all the while sneaking his more mobile forces west to the Whispering Wood and Riverrun itself. 

But, to me, sending his infantry against Tywin had a greater purpose than a simple ruse. Slow, heavy infantry has the ability to set up a blocking position in good terrain. Heavy infantry, under competent leadership, could endure a beating by Tywin as well as slow any attempt Tywin could make to unify his forces if he caught wind of the ruse. As a former infantryman myself, I cringe at the thought of these poor grunts dying in a secondary effort, but I understand the cold calculus that went into the planning.  Preventing Tywin Lannister from unifying his two armies through sacrificing some of his infantry makes a lot of tactical sense. It was lucky that Tywin Lannister didn't perceive Robb's strategy, but it was a calculated risk that came through good planning and the correct course of action.

Preparation of the Battlefield: Whispering Wood
-

&gt; “They say he crossed at the Twins with the great part of his horse, riding hard for Riverrun.”
A green boy, Tyrion remembered, more like to be brave than wise. He would have laughed, if he hadn’t hurt so much. - *AGOT, Chapter 62, Tyrion IX*

[Map of the Battle of the Whispering Woods](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/d/dc/Battle_of_the_Whispering_Wood.png)

While Roose Bolton and the 16,000 men fought Tywin at the Green Fork, Robb and his cavalry moved towards Riverrun and linked-up with Ser Marq Piper and the remainder of his father's host that was harassing Jaimie Lannister's supply lines. To screen his movement, he sent Ser Brynden Tully and Theon Greyjoy ahead with his scouts. The scouts had two objectives: determining the disposition of Jaimie Lannister's host and killing enemy scouts/ravens who would alert Jaimie of Robb's approach. To this effect, the Blackfish's strategy worked. Jaimie Lannister had no idea of what was approaching Riverrun.

Robb sent a few hundred cavalry carrying Tully banners to lure Jamie Lannister into a confrontation. Jamie Lannister took the bait and attacked what he perceived to be another harrying force with a small cavalry force of his own. When he did, Robb pounced with a hidden force of several thousand soldiers. Despite taking key losses, he succeeded in capturing Jaimie Lannister, thus removing the head from the snake.  

Surprise, Mobility, Mass: The Battle of the Camps
-

&gt; When a dam is broken, the water cascades with irresistible force. Now the shape of an army resembles water. Take advantage of the enemy’s unpreparedness; attack him when he does not expect it; avoid his strength and strike his emptiness and like water, one can oppose you. - Sun Tzu

[Map of the Battle of the Camps](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/6/69/Battle_of_the_Camps.png)


In order to besiege Riverrun, Jaimie Lannister was forced by the terrain to divide his force into three separate camps to effectively contain Hoster Tully and Tytos Blackwood within Riverrun. It was the only way to besiege the (essentially island) fortress. But with Jaimie Lannister captured and all Lannister outriders and ravens dead, Robb Stark moved his forces against two of the three Lannister camps during the night without detection. 

To the north, Robb placed Ser Brynden Tully. To the west, he placed himself. The Blackfish initiated the attack on the camp north of the Tumblestones to the complete surprise of the Lannister host. The west camp, commanded by Lord Brax attempted to take ships across the river to assist the north camp, but they were driven back by a flurry of stones from soldiers atop Riverrun's walls. Lord Brax was killed during the attempted crossing. When the soldiers from the west camp arrived back on the south short of the Tumblestones, they were suddenly set upon by Robb Stark, the Mallister and the Umbers. 

As a last stand, the Lannisters tried to use a shield wall against Robb Stark's heavy horse. Historically, a shield wall against a cavalry charge is actually fairly tactically effective. During [the Battle of Hastings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hastings), the Saxon shield wall nearly defeated the heavily armored Norman cavalry of William the Conqueror for example. The Lannister shield wall may have been effective against the Robb's attack but for one key element. The Lannisters seemingly did not count on the defenders from within Riverrun attacking their rear. The result was a complete annihilation of the Lannister west camp and north camp.

Planting the Seeds of Defeat through Victory
-

&gt; ""Roose has no feelings, you see..."" -  *ADWD, Chapter 37, The Prince of Winterfell (Reek IV)*

Upon seeing the destruction of 2/3 of the Lannister host, Ser Forley Prester, commander of the east camp, retreated in an orderly fashion. The result of the battles was an overwhelming victory for Robb Stark. Even with the losses suffered at the Green Fork, Robb Stark's host was now on something of a numerical par with Tywin Lannister's.

But in the midst of victory, we start to see the strategic shortcomings of Robb Stark. To lead his diversionary/blocking force, he placed Roose Bolton in command of his foot. At the time, it made the most sense. Roose was cold and cunning - the type of leader who would sacrifice his men for 'the greater good.' And yet the man was ruthless and worst of all, untrustworthy.

&gt; ""That man scares me."" - Robb Stark, *AGOT, Chapter 55, Catelyn VIII*

Following the conclusion of the battles, Robb Stark would have been wise to recall Roose Bolton back to Riverrun considering his own personal doubts about the man and furthermore to reconsolidate his men and materials. Instead, he allows Roose Bolton to continue to command a sizable portion of his army. Even more troubling, he doesn't seem to provide any strategic guidance to the man who would eventually betray him, but I'll get to that in a future post...

I hear a lot of talk that Daenerys Targaryen started going mad in her final chapter of A Dance With Dragons, succumbing to the disease she (might have) inherited from her father. I want to offer an alternative theory based on something I learned about Native Americans.

[Vision Quests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_quest) are rites of passage taken by members of some Native American tribes. A man will fast for one to four days in the local wilderness to learn about his identity and place in the world. This usually includes a vision of an object or creature. Typically upon his return, he will then take up his chosen vocation. Warriors who have gone on Vision Quests typically etch an image of their spirit animal upon their shields so the animals can provide them protection.

There is a lot in common between Daenerys' walk through the plains and Vision Quests: 
* Daenarys was in the wilderness for quite a few days (2 - 3), only eating the first of those days off of Drogon's scraps. Any nourishment she had was secreted out of her due to diarrhea from poor drinking water in the stream.

* The hallucinations Daenerys had could be construed as visions providing her with new purpose, re-establishing her goal to reclaim Westeros, who must bring her dragons to conquer the western lands again.

This would indicate that Daenerys is not going insane or mad, but that she is simply suffering from food-deprivation and would become her normal self again after eating to regain her health.

If I did some digging, I'm sure I could outline how the Dothraki culture is an amalgamation of various Native American tribes' cultures, values and traditions. George R.R. Martin *does* live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, a city known for its museums on Native American history. I'm sure he got a lot of information.

This is supposing that R+L=J and Jon's warging abilities.

At the end of ADWD, Jon is left fallen in the snow, having suffered multiple stab wounds at the hands of his fellow crows.  He's left to his ultimate fate and likely dead.  At least in physical form.  There has been speculation that in his final moments he will warg into Ghost, thus saving his spirit.  But what of Jon's body?

Those at the wall and north of it have grown to fear the fallen.  What is the ritual for the dead here?  A funeral pyre.

Jon Snow's body is likely going to be fed to the flames to avoid him returning as one of the Others.  His body will be burned.

But will it really?

**Here comes the tin foil**

Is it possible, like Dany, that this funeral pyre will have a magical element, that his body won't actual be consumed by the flame, but Jon Snow will in fact be reborn in the fire as AA?

It can be argued that Dany's situation was a special case, that it would be an overuse of a literary device.  But maybe Dany was just the precedent for what a Targ can do with blood magic and flame.  

GRRM has stated that we will learn about Jon's parentage, but there really wouldn't be a point to that if 1.) Jon is Dead and 2.) there wasn't a larger picture to it.  Jon and those at the wall will learn of Jon's parentage, or at least that he has a larger role to play when the NW attempts to burn his body.

**tl;dr Jon Snow will be reborn when the Night's Watch attempts to burn his body in a funeral pyre.**

*Edit:  I want to clarify that if this were to happen, Jon's rebirth in the flames would be as a result of a magical element.  Jon Snow would not survive the flames simply because he is a Targ.  As many of you scholarly crows have pointed out, GRRM himself has stated that Targ's are not inherently fire proof.  Dany's was a special case and was only able to survive unscathed from Drogo's funeral pyre as a result of blood magic.  R+L=J and the funeral pyres would more or less serve as continual parallels between Dany and Jon.  Once again, Targ's are in fact flammable.*",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1361213622.0,,Martell,True,t3_18ppfy,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/18ppfy/spoilers_all_a_theory_on_jon_snow/,

We got to talking a lot about this over in /r/asoiafreread yesterday because we just finished the chapter where Littlefinger betrays Ned. 

**Petyr Baelish isn't motivated by vengeance or a lust for power. His entire storyline happens because he's trying to save Catelyn from the Starks.** Everything else is secondary. 

From Sansa's chapter in the Eyrie at the end of Storm of Swords; Lysa talking:

&gt;“Be quiet, I haven’t given you leave to speak. You enticed him, just as your mother did that night in Riverrun, with her smiles and her dancing. You think I could forget? **That was the night I stole up to his bed to give him comfort. I bled, but it was the sweetest hurt. He told me he loved me then, *but he called me Cat*,** just before he fell back to sleep. Even so, I stayed with him until the sky began to lighten. Your mother did not deserve him. She would not even give him her favor to wear when he fought Brandon Stark. I would have given him my favor. I gave him everything. He is mine now. Not Catelyn’s and not yours.”^1

So, Littlefinger thinks he slept with Cat that night and that the two of them are in love with each other. Now reread Cat's memory of the duel between Littlefinger and Brandon Stark. It's actually pretty heartbreaking if you read it as a man fighting to save the woman he loved and who loves him in return.

&gt;And as she watched, the memory of another duel in another time came back to Catelyn Stark, as vivid as if it had been yesterday.

&gt;They met in the lower bailey of Riverrun. When Brandon saw that Petyr wore only helm and breastplate and mail, he took off most of his armor. Petyr had begged her for a favor he might wear, but she had turned him away. Her lord father promised her to Brandon Stark, and so it was to him that she gave her token, a pale blue handscarf she had embroidered with the leaping trout of Riverrun. As she pressed it into his hand, she pleaded with him. “He is only a foolish boy, but I have loved him like a brother. It would grieve me to see him die.” And her betrothed looked at her with the cool grey eyes of a Stark and promised to spare the boy who loved her.

&gt;That fight was over almost as soon as it began. Brandon was a man grown, and he drove Littlefinger all the way across the bailey and down the water stair, raining steel on him with every step, until the boy was staggering and bleeding from a dozen wounds. **“Yield!” he called, more than once, but Petyr would only shake his head and fight on, grimly.** When the river was lapping at their ankles, Brandon finally ended it, with a brutal backhand cut that bit through Petyr’s rings and leather into the soft flesh below the ribs, so deep that Catelyn was certain that the wound was mortal. **He looked at her as he fell and murmured “Cat”** as the bright blood came flowing out between his mailed fingers. She thought she had forgotten that.

&gt;That was the last time she had seen his face…until the day she was brought before him in King’s Landing. A fortnight passed before Littlefinger was strong enough to leave Riverrun, but **her lord father forbade her to visit him** in the tower where he lay abed. Lysa helped their maester nurse him; she had been softer and shyer in those days. Edmure had called on him as well, but Petyr had sent him away. Her brother had acted as Brandon’s squire at the duel, and Littlefinger would not forgive that. As soon as he was strong enough to be moved, Lord Hoster Tully sent Petyr Baelish away in a closed litter, to finish his healing on the Fingers, upon the windswept jut of rock where he’d been born.^2

He fights and fights and fights but fails to save her.

Now here's Cat remembering LF as she's about to enter Kings Landing secretly to meet with Ned about the attempt on Bran's life.

&gt;He wrote to me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed, but I burned the letter unread. By then I knew that Ned would marry me in his brother’s place.^3

What did that letter say?? I'd bet any money that it said something along the lines of ""now that Brandon's gone, we can be together."" When Cat doesn't respond (because she burned the letter), LF assumes that *Ned* has assumed the position of her jailor and vows to rescue her from the Starks.

And just more proof that LF thinks he slept with Cat. Littlefinger has just picked Sansa up from Kings Landing and is taking her to the Fingers:

&gt;“The only game. The game of thrones.” He brushed back a strand of her hair. “You are old enough to know that your mother and I were more than friends. There was a time when Cat was all I wanted in this world. I dared to dream of the life we might make and the children she would give me...but she was a daughter of Riverrun, and Hoster Tully. Family, Duty, Honor, Sansa. Family, Duty, Honor meant I could never have her hand. **But she gave me something finer, a gift a woman can give but once.** How could I turn my back upon her daughter? In a better world, you might have been mine, not Eddard Stark’s. My loyal loving daughter...Put Joffrey from your mind, sweetling. Dontos, Tyrion, all of them. They will never trouble you again. You are safe now, that’s all that matters. You are safe with me, and sailing home.”^4

We never see Littlefinger's reaction to the Red Wedding. I don't believe he was a part of it. Or, if he was, he was under the impression that Cat would be taken prisoner rather than killed: 

&gt;“So Lord Walder slew him under his own roof, at his own table?” Tyrion made a fist. “What of Lady Catelyn?” “Slain as well, I’d say. A pair of wolfskins. **Frey had intended to keep her captive**, but perhaps something went awry.”^5

After all, he's the one who tells Tywin of the plot to take Sansa to Highgarden. I'd be willing to bet that he did that to curry favor with Tywin. ""See how loyal I am? I just have one request in return...""

It creates an interesting parallel between Robert and Littlefinger. Robert goes to war to save Lyanna but she didn't need saving. Littlefinger rips apart the realm to save Cat but she too didn't need saving. I love that the hero trope is turned upside down.

He loves Sansa not just because she looks like Cat but because he was finally able to *save* her. He saved Sansa from the evil Joff and the marriage that she didn't want. Littlefinger is finally the hero that he thinks he is.

**TL;DR: Littlefinger isn't trying to succeed to punish the high lords who scoffed at him. He's trying to save the woman he loves and who he believes loved him in return. He's Prince Charming who has to save the damsel in distress. He fails to save Cat but finally succeeds in hero-ing with Sansa.**

Varamyr, I think, is an anti-type of Tolkien’s Beorn.

Martin acknowledges his debt to Tolkien freely (you can read more about it [in this interview](http://www.adriasnews.com/2012/10/george-r-r-martin-interview.html?spref=tw)) 

One quote from this interview stood out to me in reference to what Martin does with Tolkien’s influence:
&gt;I read Tolkien when I was twelve or so and he impressed me a lot so I don’t get tired of rereading it. In fact, I planned to send a letter to Mr. Tolkien when I was a child, but I finally didn’t, thing [sic] for which I am a little bit annoyed, more after getting noticed that Tolkien use [sic] to read almost every letter he received. But Tolkien wasn’t a direct influence to me when I decided to write A Song of Ice and Fire although my books are in the fantasy canon that Tolkien improved. I mean, fantasy is very ancient. We can find it in the Iliad or in the Gilgamesh Poem, but Tolkien turned it into a modern genre, and A Song of Ice and Fire shares some of these patterns but not all of them. For example, I pretend to offer a dirty fantasy, more raw than Tolkien’s.

Although Martin claims to not be directly influenced by Tolkien, I think you can see a direct influence in the figure of Varamyr Sixskins. In the Prologue to A Dance with Dragons, Varamyr recounts his childhood trauma of losing his family, and his training under Haggon, a wildling skin-changer who takes Varamyr under his wing. To me, Varamyr is a “dirty … more raw” (Martin’s words) version of Tolkien’s Beorn. 

For those unfamiliar, Beorn is a character from Tolkien’s Hobbit, a “skin-changer” whom Gandalf conjectures comes from a long line of skin-changers. (Read the chapter “Queer Lodgings” from The Hobbit if you want to brush up on Beorn.) Gandalf describes Beorn to Bilbo: “He is a skin-changer. He changes his skin: sometimes he is a huge black bear, sometimes he is a great strong black-haired man with huge arms and a great beard … some say that he is a bear descended from the great and ancient bears of the mountains that lived there before the giants came. Others say that he is a man descended from the first men” (Houghton Mifflin, 2003, p127). In ASOIAF, there is a connection between the ability to warg and lineage: only those with the blood of the [First Men can warg](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Warg).

Beorn has a retinue of animals, from horses to bears, which he treats as his equals. When Bilbo et al stay with Beorn, they awake to find the prints of many bears outside of Beorn’s house. The bear (beorn is Old English for “bear”) seems to be Beorn’s favored creature – the snow bear is Varamyr’s mount of choice, and Varamyr, too, has a retinue of animals: 3 wolves, a bear, and a shadow cat. Beorn sees himself as steward of the region and of animals. He hates goblins and Wargs, which in Tolkien’s world are something like evil dire wolves, and he warms to Bilbo and the dwarves only once he verifies their account of doing battle with those hated creatures. (I haven’t quite figured out what to do with the differing uses of the word “warg” between Tolkien and Martin – maybe Martin is, through that word, subtly signaling his debt to Tolkien). 

After Haggon dies, Varamyr takes over Haggon’s hall and becomes “a lord of sorts” (Bantam, 2011, p9). Varamyr describes it as “a hall of moss and mud and hewn logs” (9). Compare to Beorn’s house (both of which recall Anglo-Saxon halls): the main hall of Beorn’s “great wooden house” (127) contains a great, wooden table, around which Bilbo and company drink mead (139). Bilbo describes the pillars that support the roof as “like trees of the forest” (139). 

But whereas Beorn protects his region, Varamyr sees his position as a means for self-fulfillment. The surrounding villages pay homage to “Lord Varamyr” in food, cider, and salt. He raped local women, and whenever some “village hero would come with a spear in hand,” he killed them (9). Varamyr reads as a petty, indulgent lord rather than the benevolent and protective Beorn. 

In this formulation, Haggon is something like Beorn: Haggon is principled, he attempts to set out a code of conduct for warging (do not eat human flesh, do not mate with other animals, do not enter a human). Varamyr, of course, rejects this teaching.

And then, in the next Tyrion chapter, Martin has Tyrion smuggled into Pentos in a barrel.

In all, I think there are some interesting parallels between Tolkien’s skin-changers and Martin’s. Whereas Beorn is a force of good, ultimately deciding the Battle of Five Armies, Varamyr is selfish and vain – he wishes to be a lord, a king, and he uses his warging abilities to achieve those ends.

I submit to you my proposed scale of theory hardness, with definitions and examples. Can be employed as a reader rating system when theories are being posted. Any ammendments or criticisms welcome:-

**Valyrian Steel** - Something that has happened and is completely accepted by the community at large but never explicitly stated in the books. e.g Theon lost 'little theon' in the Dreadfort

**Castle Forged Steel** - A theory with large amounts of textual support and by all known literary devices a version of it should come to pass. e.g. AA and the PWWP are the same prophecy and at some point a hero/heroes will rise from amongst the ranks of characters to lead the defense of the world against the onslaught of the Others

**Plate Metal** - A generally accepted theory in the fandom with a fair amount of textual support. e.g. R+L=J

**Chain Mail** - A theory which causes debate, could have many different outcomes by applying different interpretations of the text. e.g. Dany is AA and the dragons are Lightbringer.

**Boiled Leather**:- A guess on possible outcomes, small amounts of textual support, 'Wouldnt it be nice if' type posts, with literary / fantasy tropes being applied. e.g. Arya and Sansa will meet up and use Sansas new found political savvy and Aryas assassin skills to take back Winterfell / take the Iron Throne

**Silk Doublet** - Something a bit crazier. Would subvert many tropes. In the grand scheme of things an unexpected outcome. e.g. Tommen will remain the king of Westeros 

**Tinfoil** - Completely left field idea. e.g. Stannis and Roose will set aside their differences and team up to defeat the Lannisters and Tyrells. 

**Tissue** - Never going to happen. e.g. The whole plot is Ser Pounces dream, and when he wakes up he is sitting in The Mad Kings lap as Aerys discusses the placing of wildfire under all of Kings landing with his Pyromancer. We see a young Jamie enter the Throne room, and Ser Pounce gives the reader a knowing look. The End

Any way as I say this is more for a bit of fun and I hope it, or a version of it after everyone has had their say, catches on.

EDIT: The abbreviated list from /u/mand0calrisian

**Valyrian Steel**- Heavy textual support. Is logically consistent with the ASOIAF-verse. Knowledge of literary devices and effective narrative structure point to strong plausibility. All but taken for truth by most. (e.g. R+L=J, Three-Eyed Crow=Bloodraven, Frey pie, etc.)

**Castle-Forged Steel / Lobstered Steel**- Some textual support; bullet points of relevant supporting passages can be made, but may require a certain suspension of disbelief or labeling someone an unreliable narrator. Is logically consistent with the ASOIAF-verse. Moderately to slightly plausible, but debatable. (e.g. Sandor Clegane is alive, most theories about the identity of Coldhands, Tommen's proposed death-by-poisoned-kittens, etc.)

**Boiled Leather** - Is logically consistant/plausible with the ASOIAF-verse, but there are no supporting passages at this time. Plausibility debatable. (e.g. Lyanna Stark had twins, Ashara Dayne is alive, proposals about future loyalties given current events, etc.)

Re: House Martell Casting
I wasn't present for Pedro Pascal's audition, but I understand that he really killed it with his reading. And since his casting was announced, the producer of another TV show on which he appeared recently has written me to say how terrific Pascal is, and to congratulate us on the casting. So I suspect that he will turn out to be a wonderful Red Viper.

I do know that David and Dan and HBO do favor having a racially and ethnically diverse cast on the series. It is true that we've lost several black characters who appear in the novels (Chataya and Alayaya, Jalabhar Xho, Strong Belwas), but to balance that, characters like Salladhor Saan and Xaro Xhoan Daxos, both white in the books, have been played by black actors. Missandei as well, though in the books the Naathi are golden-skinned, not white.

As for the Dornishmen, well, though by and large I reject one to one analogies, I've always pictured the ""salty Dornish"" as being more Mediterranean than African in appearance; Greek, Spanish, Italian, Portugese, etc. Dark hair and eyes, olive skin. Pedro Pascal is Chilean. (Check out Amok's version of the Red Viper, that's how I saw him. Or Magali Villenueve's beautiful and sexy portrait of Princess Arianne).

When and if the show introduces Prince Oberyn's daughters, the Sand Snakes, I expect we will see the same diversity as in the books, ranging from Tyene (blond and blue-eyed) to Sarella (light brown skin, as her mother was a Summer Islander). And I expect that the crew of the CINNAMON WIND will all be cast with black actors... assuming, of course, that Sam's voyage remains in the story.

1373634067.0,587,self.asoiaf,1i5f0f,(Spoilers All) Theory: Lightbringer Legend is how to forge Valyrian Steel,kidcrumb,732,145,349,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1i5f0f/spoilers_all_theory_lightbringer_legend_is_how_to/,"I just had a thought recently and have been thinking about it for a while. What if Lightbringer is not a special sword/tool, and the legend just describes how to make Valyrian Steel?

We all know that Valyrian Steel has magical Properties, although as of yet, it i unknown if Valyrian Steel is the ""DragonSteel"" that can kill the others. Almost all magic in ASOIAF requires a blood sacrifice. The legend of Lightbringer describes a smith, who attempts to forge a sword.

""Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered. The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew before hand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her breast, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer.""

1. Using water, gives a weak sword that will shatter when fighting against the Others. (Evidence given in prologue of AGOT when the ranger's sword shatters).

2. Using Blood of an animal creates a stronger sword, but one that still shatters. (I am still looking for evidence of this, if there is any)

3. Using the Blood of a person, gives you lightbringer (Valyrian Steel).

Throughout all of ASOIAF, blood sacrifice is needed to use Magic in almost all cases. In order to complete the forging of Valyrian Steel (A magical alloy), you not only need to work the metal over and over, you need to temper it in the blood of a person to give it magical properties.

This theory is still being researched, but, does r/asoiaf think it has any merit?


Edit: 

To clear a few things up.

Including the text above, the Theory basically states that ""Lightbringer"" is not a single sword used by AA. It refers to all Valyrian Steel Swords because they can hurt the Others. The Legend may be referring to the original casting of Valyrian Steel, but the meaning is still the same. Lightbringer is not one sword used by AA. It is Valyrian Steel and how to craft it.

Additional Speculative Information:
We know that the Valyrians captured slaves. Maybe they tempered the steel using the slaves. ""her soul combining with the steel of the sword"" of the legends implies she died and her soul went into the sword. So you cannot make Valyrian Steel by putting it into blood, you need to actually kill someone with it.

Edit 2:

Maesters get Valyrian Steel chains when they master Magic. I think this tells us for certain that Valyrian Steel has magical properties and needs magic to forge it. All of the Red God's magic comes from blood sacrifice. (Mel burns people and uses leeches). Since AA is a Red God legend and that you need magic to create Valyrian Steel, i think it is an appropriate leap to say that you need blood for Valyrian Steel.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1373652368.0,,,True,t3_1i5f0f,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1i5f0f/spoilers_all_theory_lightbringer_legend_is_how_to/,

1355327581.0,574,self.asoiaf,14q9d4,(Spoilers all) Resolved: The series must end with a Stark king or queen,feldman10,725,151,726,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/14q9d4/spoilers_all_resolved_the_series_must_end_with_a/,"There's a surprising lack of consensus among readers about who will win the game of thrones at the end of the series. But here are some points:

* **6 of 8 planned POVs were Starks**: A little-known fact about ASOIAF is that, even after GRRM finished Book 1, he [intended](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1295) to use only the Book 1 POVs for the rest of the series. Since he had his endgame planned at this point, that means that he could envision the entire series being told from the eyes of Starks, Tyrion, and Dany. So though the number of POVs has expanded since then, for a while he envisioned the series as very much the story of the Starks.

* **The series begins** with the isolated, northern Starks being drawn into a southron game of thrones they are unprepared for -- this is basically the main plot for Book 1. In the midpoint of the series, the Starks are seemingly wiped out by this game of thrones. The logical endpoint is that the Starks return, master the game of thrones, and win it. Not merely that they reappear to save the world from the Others and then go home to Winterfell -- that doesn't provide closure to the earlier thread of the Starks being chewed up by the game of thrones.

* **A Time for Wolves** was the original title of the final book. 

* **Winter Kings**: The series has built up that this winter will be unusually severe, yet it only started at the very end of Book 5. Will it be over by the end of Book 7, after the Others are dealt with? Or could it last many years more, and lead to a new line of Winter Kings who will lead Westeros through this hard time -- a time for wolves?

* **There must always be a Stark in Winterfell**: And that will be Rickon. Freeing a more important Stark to run things in the south.

* Edit: GRRM said the ending would be ""bittersweet."" This could entail the Starks becoming ""darker,"" mastering the game, and taking the throne, but losing much of their essential honorable ~~Stark-ness~~ Ned-ness.

For the purposes of this thread, let's assume there is still an Iron Throne at the end of the series (I know some people think otherwise, but I really think the series is pointing toward a unified and relatively stable Westeros, not a return to division and civil war, which is what 7 separate kingdoms would bring). So, considering that the only plausible Stark king or queens are Jon and Sansa, I feel pretty strongly that one of them has to be in power at the end of the series. But, I am not sure which one:

**Arguments against Jon**

* Duty to the Watch

* Might be busy fighting the Others

* Death and resurrection could ""change"" him and make him unsuitable for rule

* How will he convince everyone of R+L=J?

* Not clear who his queen would be if Dany ends up dying or being the antagonist

* Too magical?

**Arguments for Jon**

* Song of Ice and Fire

* R+L=J has been set up as the most important secret of the series from the very beginning

* Robb's will names Jon king in the North

* In ADWD Jon attempted to commit to the Watch fully, but he couldn't truly give up his family and the North, trying to rescue Arya and fight 
Ramsay

* ADWD seems to end with Jon breaking from the Watch, and there may not be a Watch anymore after the chaos that breaks out

* We have spent a lot of time seeing Jon dealing with the day-to-day business of ruling. GRRM has said that he wishes Lord of the Rings spent more time on Aragorn learning day-to-day. 

* Could marry Dany

* The Wars of the Roses ended with the Lancasters/Targs and Baratheons/Yorks (I know the names match up better with Lannister and Stark, but the actual characters line up better with Targs and Baratheons) being wiped out, and a remote Lancastrian claimant through a bastard line from a remote region founding the new Tudor dynasty

**Arguments against Sansa**

* She would almost certainly have to marry, and therefore her dynasty would bear her husband's name, not hers, making it somewhat less of a *Stark* victory.

* It's not clear who she would marry. Young Griff seems the best political choice, but it's debatable whether GRRM would end the series with him on the throne. (Though I do love the possibility of Tyrion stealing Varys and Littlefinger's pieces out from under them and arranging an Aegon/Sansa marriage with himself as Hand.)

**Arguments for Sansa**

* She is currently learning the game of thrones from a master

* She is the Stark most likely to gain political support in the south in the near future. She could use the Vale's food stocks to help feed the starving continent in winter, which could give her a great reputation and position her to be ""Good Queen Sansa.""

* She would come full circle, after starting book one preparing to be queen, then losing everything including her identity

* She is non-magical. I do feel that the series will end with magic receding from the world again. A Sansa win would be the triumph of practical politics, not a magical deus ex machina.

* What else is her ultimate purpose in the series?

Let me know if you have thoughts on any of these points or anything to add. I will close by mentioning one other, perhaps somewhat crackpot possibility -- **Jon+Sansa.** If we could get past the ick factor (they're really only cousins, which is tame for this series, and incest has been a major theme all along), it might actually be a pretty impressive pairing -- the man who embodies the ways of the North, with the woman who is mastering the ways of the South.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1355341350.0,,TheImp,True,t3_14q9d4,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/14q9d4/spoilers_all_resolved_the_series_must_end_with_a/,
1368469526.0,580,self.asoiaf,1e9c2o,(Spoilers all) Doubling down: The Talisa theory is wrong,feldman10,727,147,397,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1e9c2o/spoilers_all_doubling_down_the_talisa_theory_is/,"For weeks [I've argued](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1b0ydh/spoiler_asos_one_of_the_more_interesting_theories/c92ni18) that the ""Talisa as Lannister spy"" theory is wrong, based on flimsy and cherry-picked evidence, and lacking any logic. Now I must admit that the scene last night of Talisa writing a letter moves the theory, in my eyes, from ""certain tinfoil nonsense"" to ""probably tinfoil nonsense."" But I figured I'd restate my case and we'll see who's right in a few weeks:

**I. The plan is extremely implausible**

On pure grounds of plausibility, it's just not convincing at all that Tywin planned from the start that Talisa should go pose as a battlefield nurse helping wounded Lannisters in the hopes that she'd catch the eye of the King in the North, who'd not only sleep with her but then take the shocking and unprecedented action of marrying her. It is (slightly) more plausible that Tywin would send a spy to generically infiltrate the camp using sexual tactics if necessary, and the spy would hit the jackpot beyond Tywin's wildest dreams by landing Robb. This still relies on an enormous amount of luck though. 

The most generous way to define the theory focuses mainly on the letters. Yes, Talisa has been seen with two letters in the show, and Harrenhal got a letter last year with information on Robb. So, let's forget about the super-seduction plot and posit that Talisa has been sending letters to the Lannisters with information about Robb's camp, and could have had some hidden mission for them.

**II. But why would Talisa do this?**

If Talisa is who she claims to be -- a Volantene noblewoman -- I can't think of an explanation for why she'd be engaged in a dangerous spy mission on behalf of Tywin Lannister. Gold? Thrills? None of these explanations fit with the character we've seen, or provide any good reason for her to take such risks. That's why many versions of the conspiracy theory posit that Talisa must have some hidden identity  -- the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsTVnZm9hFg) claimed on the flimsiest of evidence she's not foreign at all and is actually *a Lannister.* But the various theories that Talisa is faking her foreign-ness -- which have never made much sense -- took a hit when she showed off her Valyrian last episode. 

Now, think of the logistics of how D&amp;D would handle this reveal -- they'd not only have to show that her whole character so far has been a front, but they'd also have to establish a *new* character for her that makes these super-spy actions seem plausible. I saw it posited on another thread that she was doing it for her ""pacifism,"" which doesn't make any sense to me -- tell one army about another army's movements because of pacifism? Really there is nothing in Talisa's character that we've seen that could plausibly explain why she'd do this.

**III. Thematically it adds nothing to the show and arguably demeans it.**

People say that this twist would prove how brilliant Tywin is or how far he'd go. But there's *already* gonna be a mind-blowing reveal that Tywin orchestrated the betrayal and murder of the Starks and their men by Walder Frey and Roose Bolton. What would this added complication with Talisa add to this? (In actuality it would only show how lucky Tywin is, since it would've been impossible for him to reasonably foresee that the King in the North would marry his spy.) Isn't it enough that he took advantage of the opportunity to arrange a brutal double-cross?

Now, what this twist *would* do is establish that not only was Robb's love foolish and ill-thought-out strategically, but it was also a total lie and a deliberate fraud. And my sense is that the showrunners are not that cynical-- and neither is GRRM. D&amp;D wanted to explore the tension between love and duty. Love can be wonderful and also doomed; this is what they suggested with the [end of The Climb](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dszpo/spoilers_all_the_surprising_and_powerful_ending/). And show writer Bryan Cogman [has said](http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/06/08/496478/game-of-thrones-story-editor-bryan-cogman-on-the-second-season-adapting-books-he-loves-and-the-shows-secret-main-character/?mobile=nc) Robb's arc is about love vs. duty.

&gt; COGMAN: Originally, it was Jeyne Westerling. In the books, Jeyne is tending his wounds, Robb gets a terrible piece of news, and they spend the night together dealing with his grief, and he marries her after that. [In the show], it isn’t just about making an honest woman out of this girl, it’s that he falls in love and chooses love over duty, which is an ongoing choice which is brought up again and again throughout the series. Maester Aemon tells Jon Snow that love is the death of duty. And I think that was something that they really wanted to explore, that it was a relationship that developed, and that we would see develop, and Robb would make the choice.

The conflict between love and duty becomes far less interesting if the love is just a scam.

**IV. So what was the point of that scene?**

Simple: A last happy moment (and nude scene) of Robb and Talisa together before the tragedy. The pregnancy strengthens this interpretation. It's an added detail by the showrunners to heighten the tragedy when the true love couple of Robb and Talisa are murdered. Why was Talisa writing a letter? Because Robb went over to work on his battle plans and they had to give Talisa something of her own to do. Writing a letter is a better starting point for further dialogue then if she was just rearranging her first aid kit or something.

I am getting worried that the two remaining books wont be enough to actually give a satisfying ending to all of our beloved characters. In fact, by the end of Dance (and in the preview chapters of Winds), there are almost too many little stories going on within the big story of ASOIAF to list. Almost.
    
   Here is a list of the things George has to tie up in two books:

 1)**The Lands of always Winter**: George mentioned we would end up here, likely it is here where we learn mostly about the others. Maybe Uncle Stark makes an entrance as well. 

 2)**Bran and the Gang**: Whats going to happen to them?

 3)**Blood Raven**: What is his end game? What is he going to do with Bran?

 4) **Coldhands**: Who? What? Seriously, who is this guy?

 5) **Dead things in the water**: What ever happened to the wildlings near eastwatch?

 6)**The Wall**: Who is in charge now? Has it descended into chaos? Is Wun-Wun the wun in charge?

 7)**Jon ""Ceaser"" Snow**: Dead? Wolf? Zombie?

 8) **Melisandre**: See Bloodraven. What is her plan? Her motives?

 9) **Wildlings, Giants, a certain giant member**: What is going to happen to the wildlings south of the wall now that Jon is (at least for now) out of the picture?

 10) **Winterfel**l: How long will the Boltons hold out?

 11) **King beyond the the Wall**: How sorry should we feel for Mance and his lovely ladies? Were they responsible for every single one of the murders in Winterfell? 

 12) **The North remembers**: What are the loyal Stark bannermen (including Fats Manderly and the Umber crew) planning on doing about the Boltons? 

 13) **Onions and Unicorns**: What ever happened to lil Stark, Osha and Captain Mutha Fuckin Beard?

 14) **The Mannis**: How is Stannis planing to win the Battle in the Snow?

 15) **Rhymes with Freak**: Will poor Theon find redemption or just be served with some Heart Tree justice?

 16)**Queen Asha**: Will Theons sister figure out a way to drag him back home again?

 17) **Iron Bank**: Stannis sent some dude across the narrow sea to get troops. I dont even remember his name. This will likely be important though.

 18) **Greywater watch**: People have been waiting since the Clinton administration for Howland Reed to come out of the swamps and start spreading some wisdom.

 19) **On the Road to Greywater Watch**: A certain bastard may be pretty upset that his brother didn't just send him a text after learning that the two Stark Bannermen charged with naming a new heir to the King in the North got lost in the swamps for 13 years (and counting)

 20) **Heh**: What is in store for the perps and captives of the Red Weddin? 

 21) **Sends his regards**: Is our favorite handsome, goldhanded, child-crippling, sister banging, kingslaying, smooth operating, recently reformed knight walking into a zombie trap? Yup.

 22) **Speaking of Zombies...**: What is the Ladies stonehearted plan? Does it involve Tom o Sevens and the Frey Wedding? What did she do to Brienne?

 23) **I wonder where that fish did go?** : Blackfish is missing. Will he attempt to rescue his nephew on the way to Casterly rock?

 24)**The ladder**: Will Littlefinger succeed in his plan to marry Sansa to Harry the Heir? 

 25) **The Mad Mouse**: Will this lil fella steal Sansa and take her back to Kings Landing?

 26) **The Bastard of the vale**: Will Sansa ever do something on her own volition beside play in the snow and brush her hair?

 27) **The lil Bastard of the Vale**: Will poor Sweet-Robbin just kick the bucket already?

 28)  **Ser Gendry**: Will THIS bastard ever do something to validate his inclusion in all of this?

 29) **Greyjoy vs. Greyjoy**:  Over on the Iron Islands its King Crows Eye the cunning and sinister magician against Damphair: the ex drunk who found purpose via medieval CPR techniques. Who will win? Knowing GRRM they both get eaten by a kraken a few chatpers into Winds.

 30) **Manderly and his Ships**: Did he say he was massing ships? I think he did...

 31) **Dragonstone**: What ever happened to poor Ser Loras?

 32) **The Rock**: GRRM mentioned that we will be seeing Casterly Rock for the first time in the next two books. My guess is that the Queen is going home. 

 33) **Kings Landing**: After Kevens run in with the little birds, who is in charge now? No one talks about this but it seems important to me.

 34) **The Faith**: These guys kind of came out of left field. What are they planning with their new military?

 35) **The Trials**: Two pretty ladies are in for some faith style fun, one of which even has a Frankenstein style fighter she named after her late husband.

 36) **Qyburn**: What is this guys deal? See Coldhands. Seriously whats up with Qyburn?

 37) **Tyrell bannermen**: What are the Tyrells planning on doing with the large amounts men marching to Kings Landing?

 38) **Varys**: After Tywins Death, Has he just been running around inside the walls the whole time? Also, see Bloodraven, what is your deal?

 39)**Robert Strong**: I said before he was a Frankenstein style monster, I was just guessing though. For all we know it is two of Varys` little birds standing on each others shoulders.   

 40) **Ser Bronn Blackwater, Lord of Stokeworth**: He is gathering sell swords, naming kids Tyrion, and just generally not giving a fuck. Typical Bronn. (As a side note, am I the only one who finds it funny that a sellsword ends up being named ""Blackwater""?) 

 41) **Tyrells need them ships**: How are the Tyrells dealing with those feisty Ironborn?

 42)**Intrigues in Oldtown**: What is Old Sam up to? What ever happened to that girl he liked? That kid? Something about a crazy magician/maester crossing the narrow sea to meet the Mother of Dragon? Some Dornish chick dressed like a dude is mixed up in all this too. Oh! not to mention...

 43) **Our Good Friend Pate, or was it Jaqen?** : A magical shape shifting assassin is also mixed up in the intrigues of Oldtown.

 44) **The golden company**: Refreshingly straight forward. Aegon Targaryen has landed and now he is conquering stuff in the Stormlands. Typical Targ... or IS he?

 45) **Ariannes sexcapades**: Doran Martell has sent forth his daughter to figure out the deal with the Targ invasion 2.0

 46) **YAR**: New pirate captain (pirate lord?), likely that Waters guy who Cersei in charge of the ships in Kings Landing. The story needed this.

 47) **The man with the plan**: Doran Martell is sitting on his ass bossing his family around as per usual. This time his plan has something to do with poor Balon Swann and schlepping him around Dorne.

 48) **Darkstar**: I am the night, I am on the run from Aero cause he gonna put an axe in me. 

 49) **Myrcella**: Poor thing is likely already traumatised for life; although knowing GRRM Myrcy is going to get lost on her way back north and run into a dude named ""Ramsey""

 50) **As the final Westeros plot point**: I should mention that Krakens were sighted off the coasts of Dorne. I dunno but to me that seems like a big deal. 
  Now for the plot points across the narrow sea.

 51)**BRAVOS!** : Our favourite little killer Arya is training to become a shape shifting assassin (psh, saw that coming). Where is GRRM taking this plot point? Smart money is on plot point 50 and 51 coming together in some spectacular way.

 52) **What ever happened to...**: This is an honest question. What ever happened to the crew of the ship Tyrion rode with Prince Aegon? We know what happened to Connington, what about the others?  

  53)**The Imp**: Yup, it took 53 plot points to get to our second ""Big Three"" main character. Although stuck outside Meereen, Tyrion - as per usual - has plan, which will decide the fate of little Penny, Brown Benn, and our favourite slave trading spy, Jorah Mormont. 

 54)**Meereen and the other free cities**: War is going down between the free cities, GRRM will reveal to us why we care about all this.

 55)**Daario**: Handsome fuck, what ever happened to him?

 56) **Ser Grandfather**: Charged with the defence of a middle eastern style city across the sea from his homeland, Baristan must defend Meereen as the city is attacked by all manners of freaks and slaves. (Psh, saw that coming). Oh, and two dragons are on the loose around the city.

 57) **The various leaders of Meereen**: I don't even know their names. At this point I hope Drogan eats the lot of them.

 58)**The Iron Dummy**. Planning on making a grande aquatic entrance the battle of Meereen with his flame hand and dragon horn. Victarions entrance to the Slavers Bay story line is just gonna be so awesome. 

 59)**The Mother of Dragons**: When the sun rises in the west, and mountains crumble into dust, only then will Daenerys just get on a fucking boat already. The last we saw  of our third main character she had come full circle by shitting herself in the desert. Some people on horses came as well. She also has a big fuckin Dragon.   

 60) **AND FINALLY... Quaithe**: See Coldhands, See Qyburn. Who are these people? Why do they have to be so weird?
 
Oh you thought we were done? How wrong you were. Here are the more general plot ideas not routed to one location.

 61)**Invasion of the Others**: All of westeros is in danger of being run over by evil, undead summoning ice elf things. About 50 people in Westeros know about this, even less seem to care.

 62) **Prince that was promised, Azor Azai, Stallion who mounts the world, Dragon has three heads, etc**: Are all these prophesies ever going to amount to anything?

 63) **Gods, seasons, Magic**: Are we ever going to get an explanation of how all this malarky works? 

 64) **Dragons**: At some point, Westeros is bound to get a little roasty

 65) **Knight of the laughing tree**: Who dat?

 66) **Promise me Ned**: Promise me you will never have an inner monologue which makes any of mine and your past clear. In fact, promise me that you will mostly think of me when your doped up or half asleep. 

 67) **ASOIAF**: 17 years and counting, we still dont know what the deal is with the title. Yup, the title. In 5 books, GRRM has not even given us this one.    

 And those are the plot points George has to cover within the next two books. So to finish up... What does everyone think the 8th book of ASOIAF will be called? The ninth? But seriously, my prediction is that we are bound to see a massive coming together of characters we have gotten to know from Westeros, or else there is simply too much material to cover in two 1000 or so page books.

Recently there has been a lot of discussion of names on this subreddit, mostly centering on the meaning of names which has been really interesting, in the spirit of this I wanted to share a theory I have about the nature of names in ASOIAF centering on Ramsay Snow.

 Names are vitally important in ASOIAF, the family name is one of the most important parts of a character. Tywin in particular is obsessed with the Lannister name and what it symbolizes, but all other characters identify with it and it is a defining factor, everyone has certain perceptions about what kind of person a Stark is and that differs from their interpretation of a Frey. Bastard names are equally important, demonstrating instantly that the character is inherently an outsider. The name that Bastard's bear signifies them as being forever locked out of the inner sanctum of society, bastards can belong to a family but they can never truly be an integral part of that family (see Jon Snow who even though he was raised by Ned as essentialy a son remained an outsider in Winterfell)

No character is more obsessed with names, especially bastard names, than Ramsay. At heart Ramsay's torturing of Theon is an attempt to see if a person's name can be truly changed. While Ramsay certainly enjoys torturing Theon, taking perverse pleasure in the pain he causes,  he also seeks to truly change Theon as a person, culminating in Theon being renamed as Reek. Theon is an extreme example and Ramsay takes extreme measures in his experiment, trying to erase all of who  Theon is as a person. And even after he is granted some freedom (and eventually escapes) Theon still continually flashes back to being forced to remember/repeat the name Ramsay bestowed onto him (Reek rhymes with). 

But why? Ramsay has been legitimized, his name is Bolton, the stain of Snow has been swept away, for all intents and purposes he is Lord Bolton's heir and as long as he draws breath he will be Lord Bolton's only heir. So why does he so desperately want to learn how/if it is possible to change a name if his has already been changed? Because just because someone (even a king) writes something on a piece of paper does not make it so. Ramsay grew up dreaming of being legitimized, of being a real Bolton, then his dream came true and it's as though nothing changed. He is still not accepted, people still whisper about the ""Bastard's Boys"" (though not to his face obviously). He is still Ramsay Snow. No matter what else happens in his mind he will always be Ramsay Snow. All of his torture of Theon is designed to make Ramsay's dream come true, to truly change someone's name. If it can happen to Theon than maybe it can happy to Ramsay. The experiment is mildly successful but after Theon escapes it ultimately fails as he regains his sense of self and, ultimately his name. 

Why is this important? I don't know if it is, however if it is true it shows some of Ramsay's motivation. I think it also fleshes out the Ramsay, Theon, Jeyne story (all have adopted new names, Ramsay by choice, Theon against his will and Jeyne out of necessity) Ultimately I think it also has implication towards Jon Snow who, if the letter arrives from Rob or Stannis decided to, could have the Snow name dropped and will face similar problems. 

Ultimately I have one last thought, Tyrion famously tells Jon early on to cloak himself in the name Snow, in being a bastard, that way it cannot be turned against him. Ramsay never put that armor on, Snow covered Ramsay in another way and now that he's shaken it off it still holds onto his heart, telling him that he will never be what he wants to be. Ultimately, even more than Reek or his Father's indifference/cruelty   or any of a hundred other things Ramsay is defined by his always being Ramsay Snow. In this way, maybe this way alone, Ramsay is a tragic figure. 

tl;dr I believe that Ramsay will always be Ramsay Snow in his mind not Ramsay Bolton.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,Baratheon,True,t3_140dsr,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/140dsr/spoilers_all_ramsay_snow_not_ramsay_bolton/,
1353508195.0,567,self.asoiaf,13kena,(Spoilers All) Mormont's Raven,danNYtrack,666,99,159,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/13kena/spoilers_all_mormonts_raven/,"[A post from yesterday] (http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/13ib34/spoilers_all_bran_mormonts_raven_warging_and_time/) was discussing Mormont's raven. I stated that the raven is actually being warged by Bloodraven. I went to collect some quotes that might back up this theory and it got a little out of control so I decided to start a new post.

I understand that these quotes can be interpreted in a multitude of ways but this is the way that I read them.

If we go ahead and assume R+L=J (which is probably the safest of assumptions we can make) then we can see why Bloodraven would leed Jon through the raven. We *know* Bloodraven is a staunch Targaryen loyalist. He protected the dynasty from threats on multiple occasions and even slew his own brother to do so. As the last Greenseer it is quite possible that he is aware of Jon's Targaryen blood and therefore has a vested interest in Jon's fate. Also, we *know* that Bloodraven is vested in Bran's future. Additionally, the raven can obviously mimic words it hears but pay close attention to the key words it chooses to mimic. Furthermore, at times the raven says words that were not spoken at all. I am also assuming that Bloodraven is determined to destroy the others. Keep these things in mind while reading through some of these quotes from the series and let me know what you all think or if you can add to this theory:


**Bloodraven talking to Bran:**

&gt;
*I’m trying,* the crow replied. *Say, got any corn?*
&gt;



**Bloodraven is excited that Bran will live:**

&gt;
Bran was going to live. “My brother is going to live,” he told Mormont. The Lord Commander shook his head, gathered up a fistful of corn, and whistled. The raven flew to his shoulder, crying, “Live! Live!”
&gt;



**Bloodraven knew it was foolish to send Royce as a lead Ranger:**

&gt;
The Royce boy was green as summer grass, yet he insisted on the honor of his own command, saying it was his due as a knight. I did not wish to offend his lord father, so I yielded. I sent him out with two men I deemed as good as any in the Watch. More fool I.”
&gt;

&gt;
“Fool,” the raven agreed. Tyrion glanced up. The bird peered down at him with those beady black eyes, ruffling its wings. “Fool,” it called again. Doubtless old Mormont would take it amiss if he throttled the creature. A pity.
&gt;



**Bloodraven knows that fire kills wights:**

&gt;
Jon tried to shout, but his voice was gone. Staggering to his feet, he kicked the arm away and snatched the lamp from the Old Bear’s fingers. The flame flickered and almost died. “Burn!” the raven cawed. “Burn, burn, burn!”
&gt;



**Taunting the word *father* to Jon can be taken as suspicious:**

&gt;
“Father,” taunted the old raven, bobbing its head as it walked across Mormont’s shoulders. “Father.”
&gt;



**Bloodraven would obviously be disgusted about Joffery being on the throne:**

&gt;
“We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls, and a boy sits the Iron Throne,” he said in disgust.
&gt;

&gt;
The raven laughed shrilly. “Boy, boy, boy, boy.”
&gt;


**About Longclaw which may be effective in battling the others:**

&gt;
“Take it,” echoed his raven, preening. “Take it, take it.”
&gt;



**Bloodraven was the LC of the Watch. He wants the Watch to remember its real purpose, protecting the realm against the others:**

&gt;
""...yet if the Night’s Watch does not remember, who will?”
&gt;

&gt;
“Who will,” chimed the talkative raven. “Who will.”
&gt;



**Bloodraven knew Jon considered abandoning his oath to the Watch:**

&gt;
“Know,” the raven echoed from Mormont’s shoulder. “Know.”
&gt;



**Bloodraven most likely knows of the coming war of the others:**

&gt;
Jon chewed his lip. The raven flapped its wings at him. “War, war, war, war,” it sang.
&gt;



**Bloodraven is possibly trying to make Jon question why his faster wanted him there/or Bloodraven himself is questioning why:**

&gt;
“Your lord father sent you to us, Jon. Why, who can say?”
&gt;

&gt;
“Why? Why? Why?” the raven called.
&gt;



**Bloodraven knows that Craster *is* a slave of the others/and knows Craster's women are pretty much slaves to him:**

&gt;
The woman licked at thin lips. “This is our place. Craster keeps us safe. Better to die free than live a slave.”
&gt;

&gt; 
“Slave,” muttered the raven.
&gt;


**Bloodraven again is reiterating that he knows of Craster's horrendous deeds:**

&gt;
“He gives his sons to the wood.”
&gt;

&gt;
A long silence. Then: “Yes.” And “Yes,” the raven muttered, strutting. “Yes, yes, yes.”
&gt;



**This is directly before the slaughter at The Fist:**

&gt;
“Die,” screamed Mormont’s raven, flapping its black wings. “Die, die, die.”
&gt;



**After Samwell informed Mormont that he got the messages out at the Fist:**

&gt;
“Good.” On Mormont’s shoulder his own raven echoed, “Good, good.”
&gt;



**Bloodraven telling Sam to hurry up and flee Craster's:**

&gt;
“Quick” the raven said. “Quick quick quick.”
&gt;



**Bloodraven choosing Jon for Lord Commander:**

&gt;
The kettle was in the corner by the hearth, a big black potbellied thing with two huge handles and a heavy lid. Maester Aemon said a word to Sam and Clydas and they went and grabbed the handles and dragged the kettle over to the table. A few of the brothers were already queueing up by the token barrels as Clydas took the lid off and almost dropped it on his foot. With a raucous scream and a clap of wings, a huge raven burst out of the kettle. It flapped upward, seeking the rafters perhaps, or a window to make its escape, but there were no rafters in the vault, nor windows either. The raven  was trapped. Cawing loudly, it circled the hall, once, twice, three times. And Jon heard Samwell Tarly shout, “I know that bird! That’s Lord Mormont’s raven!”
&gt;

&gt;
The raven landed on the table nearest Jon. “Snow,” it cawed. It was an old bird, dirty and bedraggled. “Snow,” it said again, “Snow, snow, snow.” It walked to the end of the table, spread its wings again, and flew to Jon’s shoulder.
&gt;



**Bloodraven possibly foreshadowing Jon's death (he screams death frequently):**

&gt;
“Dead,” said the raven. It was one of the bird’s favorite words. “Dead, dead, dead.”
&gt;



**Bloodraven telling Samwell to obey Jon's command to become a maester. It could be theorized that Bloodraven knows Samwell has a role to play in doing such:**

&gt;
“Obey.” Mormont's raven flapped its great black wings.
&gt;



**Bloodraven is constantly ""talking"" to Jon through the raven:**

&gt;
“Did you follow me as well?” Jon reached to shoo the bird away but ended up stroking its feathers. The raven cocked its eye at him. “Snow,” it muttered, bobbing its head knowingly.
&gt;



**On multiple occasions Jon awakens from prophetic dreams with the raven on his chest. It can be assumed that Bloodraven is influencing/speaking to him through these dreams:**

&gt;
...and woke with a  raven  pecking at his chest. “Snow,” the bird cried. Jon swatted at it. The raven shrieked its displeasure and flapped up to a bedpost to glare down balefully at him through the predawn gloom.
&gt;



**No explanation necessary:**

&gt;
He rose and dressed in darkness, as Mormont’s raven muttered across the room. “Corn,” the bird said, and,  “King,” and, “Snow, Jon Snow, Jon Snow.” That was queer. The bird had never said his full name before, as best Jon could recall.

You have danced the dance before, my friend."" Everyone assumes that he is referring to the death of Jon Arryn, because that was the most recent Hand to die. However, we find out in ASOS that Littlefinger was behind Jon Arryn's death, meaning Varys most likely had nothing to do with it. On the other hand (no pun intended), we find out in ADWD that Jon Connington is still alive, having faked his death to help Aegon. I think that *this* is the hand that Illyrio was referring to in his conversation with Varys, which means Illyrio was asking Varys to fake Ned's death and smuggle him east to support Aegon. I think this makes more sense for a few different reasons-

1. Varys would not have wanted Jon Arryn to die. He was trying to delay war for as long as possible, and Jon Arryn's death (and Lysa's note) sparked the tension between the Starks and Lannisters.

2. Varys probably did not ""dance the dance"" for Jon Arryn, but he definitely did for Jon Connington.

3. Varys' response to Illyrio's proposal was ""Then is not now, and this Hand is not the other."" Ned Stark was raised by Jon Arryn, and they likely had very similar values. Also, Jon Arryn had only been dead for a few months at this point. The time period wasn't drastically different. Jon Connington was presumed dead long before this conversation, and had very different motivations from Jon Arryn and Ned Stark, so it's more likely that Varys and Illyrio were referring to him.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,,True,t3_19xiot,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/19xiot/spoilers_all_if_one_hand_can_die_why_not_a_second/,

That thread can still be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/opxvj/spoilers_all_books_ask_george_rr_martin_almost/). Tonight, Mr. Martin sent back his responses to our questions! Enjoy!

&gt;1) Is there anything (or a lot of things) you put in the previous books that you expected readers to pick up on, but no one (or very few people) did?
&gt;
&gt;**I suspect that the fans have picked up on everything by this point.  With so many people reading the books, and sharing their thoughts on blogs and bulletin boards, even the most obscure clues soon are found and pointed out.**
&gt;
&gt;2) Will we get to see Valyria?
&gt;
&gt;**As it was before the Doom?  As it is today?**
&gt;
&gt;**Maybe.**
&gt;
&gt;3) Can you give us three unanswered questions that you expect will be answered in Winds?
&gt;
&gt;**I could, but I won't.**
&gt;
&gt;4) Is Bronn's storyline arc done? He was one of my favorite characters in the early books and in the T.V show but it seems like he came to a peak in A Feast for Crows and received no mention in A Dance with Dragons. Please keep Bronn going!
&gt;
&gt;**Bronn still has a part to play.  He will definitely be back.**
&gt;
&gt;5) Has there been a character that you have given a reprieve to, or maybe deviated from the &gt;path you originally were going to send them on? If so, whom?
&gt;
&gt;**No, not really.**
&gt;
&gt;**In some cases the chronologies have diverged from what I originally intended, but the overall character arcs remain the same.**
&gt;
&gt;6) Did writing about Reek disturb you as much as it did for us to read about him?
&gt;
&gt;**Those chapters were certainly challenging to write, but I would not say they disturbed me.  The challenge was to find ways to disturb my readers, while still keeping the character psychologically true.**
&gt;
&gt;7) Do you feel like HBO is putting pressure on you to finish the last two books of the series? Does this have any effect on your creative output?
&gt;
&gt;**No and no.**
&gt;
&gt;**It would not matter if they did.  No one could more pressure on me than I put on myself.**
&gt;
&gt;8) Provided the Ironmen had not attacked the North and the Red Wedding had not taken place, would/could the North and Riverlands have survived as an independent kingdom?
&gt;
&gt;**The north, perhaps.  The riverlands are more problematic.  With no real natural boundaries, the riverlands are vulnerable to attack from all sides, which is why their history has been so full of blood and tumult.**
&gt;
&gt;9) What would you say is the biggest red herring that we the fans picked up that you did not intend to be a red herring?
&gt;
&gt;**That would be telling.  But the fans have spun a few theories out of thin air.  They email me about them from time to time.**
&gt;
&gt;10) In regard to the intricate, wonderful and probably very frustrating plot skein you've woven: do you think that you're ""over the hump"" so to speak, or will the books get progressively more complex to write each time? 
&gt;
&gt;**I certainly hope I am over the hump, but I have given up making predictions.  Whenever I do, I get burned.  I am still juggling an awful lot of balls.  Maybe too many, but having tossed them in the air, I feel obliged to juggle on.**

Stannis has always been among my favorite characters, and I've been pretty distraught about what I saw last night. Feel free to correct me if I've gotten the order of what my recollection of the books incorrect.  

One of the major themes of ASOIAF is that of identity. Discovering ones identity, losing ones identity , rediscovery of ones identity.  We saw it with Jaime, a man who once had this admirable view of knights and ""the system"" and then was jaded by how he was treated by Aerys and then later Ned and the whole realm for branding him as dishonorable for the most honorable act he believes he did.  We saw it with Arya, as who she was slowly fades away into someone else, desperately trying to hold on to the last thing that makes her Arya Stark. We see it with Jon as he tries to make his own identity as a man of the Night's Watch and not just some bastard. We see it with Sansa, we see it with Tyrion, we see it Dany.

We also see it with Stannis. After the Blackwater, he's filled with self doubt. He agonizes about whether to sacrifice Edric Storm. He knows its wrong, but he's desperate. He's desperate for anything that can get him back in the game and give him the opportunity to get what he believes is his, the Iron Throne.  He doubts Melisandre actually caused Robbs death or Balon's death.  He's doesn't believe 100% in Melisandre but he's cornered an isn't sure if he has another choice. 

But then, with the help of Davos (and we all know the quote), he rediscovers his identity. He's realizes he's the King, whether he has King's Landing or not. And as King, he has his duty. He doesn't wait to get confirmation of Rhllors power after Joff dies. No. He goes to the Wall because he is King and its his duty to protect the realm.  

It has nothing to do with Rhllor or Melisandre. It has to do with him and his rediscovery of himself and what he lost at the Blackwater. Doing his duty.

 Now, he's going to the Wall because Melisandre told him to go. Because Rhllor commands it. Stannis can go to the Wall and save it next season, but its tainted and its different now. Stannis' decision to go to the Wall was crucial to his own character growth and sadly, the show took that away from him.  Even if he does rediscover himself later, his impetus to go to the Wall now appears to be forced and now show Stannis cannot be the Mannis.

Joffrey obviously isn't the easiest character to relate to, and it takes a big stretch for book readers to sympathise with someone quite clearly written to get the readers blood boiling, but the show is a different...

When I read about Joffrey dying at the purple wedding, I honestly didn't really give a shit. Everyone knew it was coming sooner or later, and the inevitability made it feel slightly anti-climactic when he finally bit the bullet. I definitely wouldn't have said it was a scene I was particularly looking forward to seeing, when you consider the competition... but now I really looking forward to it, be it this season or the next. Jack gleeson is absolutely nailing it so far, and it's actually going to be a loss to the show when he goes. Hopefully they do it justice.

The main reason for my change of heart regarding the whole purple wedding plot is the shows handling of the Tyrells. Emma Peel was a great choice as The Queen of Thorns, but the star of the show is surely Natalie Dormer, she's playing the manipulative bitch role to a tee. You can totally see Joffrey is being played, but you know he doesn't stand a chance against Margery... I absolutely love it. I like the simplification of the Willas/Sansa/Loras triangle too.

##Andal Succession  

*A daughter before an uncle.*

It is the same as [male-preference cognatic primogeniture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male-preference_cognatic_primogeniture#Male-preference_cognatic_primogeniture). Pretty much all Houses with the exception of the Dornish and Targaryens follow Andal succession laws. In this form the eldest legitimate son inherits followed by that son's descendants. A daughter can inherit if she has no living legitimate brothers, and those brothers have no heirs. A younger sibling inherits only if his elder sibling died without any descendants.

##Targaryen Succession  

*An uncle before a daughter.*

This is a form of [agnatic primogeniture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male-preference_cognatic_primogeniture#Agnatic_primogeniture), which greatly favors males over females inheriting. Female lines are disinherited, so males typically always inherit before females, even collaterally related males (i.e. uncles/brothers over daughters). It's not entirely clear how male-driven the Targaryen succession was, since they never had to look very far for a suitable male heir. It's likely a female could inherit if they were the last descendant of the patrilineal lines (male derived lines). For example, a more distant male relation from a female line (e.g. king's sister's son) wouldn't inherit over a daughter of a king, but a male relation from a male line (e.g. king's brother's son) would. (credit to /u/feldman10) The Targaryens at first followed Andal succession, but started following this form of succession following the [""Dance of the Dragons""](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dance_of_the_Dragons) when Rhaenyra and Aegon II (half-siblings) fought over their father's crown. 

##Dornish Succession  
It is essentially [absolute cognatic primogeniture or equal primogeniture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male-preference_cognatic_primogeniture#Absolute_cognatic_primogeniture). This makes no distinction between gender; it is the oldest legitimate child and his/her descendants that inherit.

##Bastards  
In any of the above laws of succession, bastards do not inherit at all. However, if a bastard is legitimized they stand to inherit **after** all trueborn children, including daughters and younger siblings (credit to /u/Axetronaut). Although this is not always the case and can be a point of contention and dispute. This is why Roose is convinced that Ramsay will kill any children Fat Walda has, because those children would be trueborn to Roose and thus come in line before Ramsay (ADWD 32: Reek III).

Typically only acknowledged bastards (i.e. ones welcomed into the father's house) are legitimized. Ramsay Snow, Jon Snow, Aurane Waters, Edric Storm, Joy Hill, and the Sand Snakes are all examples of acknowledged bastards. People like Gendry and Mya Stone are unacknowledged bastards, so it is exceedingly unlikely they would be legitimized, as they would need proof of their lineage and they have none. Also, only a King can legitimize a bastard, not a Lord or even Lord Paramount.

##Exceptions  
These succession laws are not set in stone. They can be amended and circumvented so long as the sitting Lord desires it. For example, Tyrion is technically Tywin's heir at the start of AGOT (since Jaime refuses to renounce his vows and inherit). However, Tywin tells Tyrion in ASOS that he will not allow him to inherit Casterly Rock and will pass over him in favor of Cersei.

Another notable exception is the Iron Islanders' kingsmoot, in which a leader is chosen regardless of lineage based on voting. This is only used sparingly and during extenuating circumstances. It's what allowed Euron to be crowned ahead of Theon and Asha.

##Multiple Titles  
A person can hold claim to multiple titles. For example, Tommen is currently King, Lord of Storm's End, and Lord of Dragonstone. He is also next in line for Casterly Rock behind his mother. He could hold all four titles if he wanted to. Robert gave his Storm's End lordship to Renly by choice.

###SUCCESSION LINES OF NOTABLE HOUSES

**EDIT:** I've decided to include all people in the succession lines starting from the time of Robert's Rebellion.

* **bold**  - current head
* ~~strikethrough~~ - dead
* *italics* - unable to inherit for various reasons:
 1. bastard, inherits if legitimized
 2. enemy of the crown, inherits if pardoned of crimes
 3. taken vows, inherits if released from vows
 4. missing or presumed dead

*Note:* Jon Snow/Stark assumes Jon is Ned's son. Jon Snow/Targaryen assumes R+L=J.

##House Stark of Winterfell  
~~Rickard~~ &gt; ~~Brandon~~ &gt; ~~Eddard~~ &gt; ~~Robb~~ &gt; *Bran*^4 &gt; *Rickon*^4 &gt; *Sansa*^4 &gt; *Arya*^4 &gt; *Jon Snow/Stark*^1&amp;3 &gt; *Benjen*^3&amp;4 &gt; ~~Lyanna~~ &gt; *Jon Snow/Targaryen*^1&amp;3 &gt; distant Vale relations

*Note:* Current recognized head of House Stark is an impostor Arya Stark (Jeyne Poole) and Ramsay Bolton.

I can read it over and over again and still get frisson from witnessing Sansa's transformation and perhaps something supernatural going on in the background. 

##Power of snow:

&gt; She awoke all at once, every nerve atingle. For a moment she did not remember where she was. She had dreamt that she was little, still sharing a bedchamber with her sister Arya. 

The chapter opens with a dream Sansa has. Her body's nerves are atingle. Something woke her up. She would often have nightmares of her father's beheading but

&gt; but this dream had not been like that. Home. It was a dream of home.

Something has changed. She cannot fall asleep anymore. Then she realizes that it is snowing outside. Sansa wonders

&gt;   Snow was falling on the Eyrie.

&gt; Outside the flakes drifted down as soft and silent as memory. Was this what woke me? 

Sansa steps out and enjoys the snowfall. She associates the snow with innocence, Winterfell and her dreams. 

&gt; Drifting snowflakes brushed her face as light as lover's kisses, and melted on her cheeks. At the center of the garden, beside the statue of the weeping woman that lay broken and half-buried on the ground, she turned her face up to the sky and closed her eyes. She could feel the snow on her lashes, taste it on her lips. *It was the taste of Winterfell. The taste of innocence. The taste of dreams.*


Throughout the chapter snow has been giving strength to Sansa. When Lysa is trying to push her out of the moondoor, Sansa doesn't really fight her off. She tries to talk her way out. And then

&gt;  She could feel snowflakes melting on her cheeks. Sansa flailed, found Lysa's thick auburn braid, and clutched it tight. ""My hair!"" her aunt shrieked. ""Let go of my hair!""

Sansa even faints for no reason whatsoever.

&gt;  When Sansa opened her eyes again, she was on her knees. She did not remember falling. It seemed to her that the sky was a lighter shade of grey. Dawn, she thought. Another day. Another new day.

Sansa is the very image of the old gods when her white face flushes red.

&gt;  but your face is flushed and you can scarcely breathe

There is ankle deep snow in the garden.

&gt; A pure world, Sansa thought. I do not belong here.


&gt; Yet she stepped out all the same.

Sansa is associating pure with the snows and the North. 

## Sansa

&gt; She donned silken smallclothes and a linen shift, and over that a warm dress of blue *lambswool. *Two pairs of hose for her legs, boots that laced up to her knees, heavy leather gloves, and finally a *hooded cloak of soft white fox fur.*

Sansa is a direwolf but she is wearing a cloak of sheep. She has still to mature and hence wears lambswool. Foxes are associated with cunning and cleverness. She is clever now. She will become cunning when she matures.

&gt; At the center of the garden, beside the statue of the weeping woman that lay broken and half-buried on the ground, 

This statue is of Alyssa Arryn whose family was all killed but it represents Sansa here. Sansa herself believes her family is all dead. The statue was broken during the trial by combat of Tyrion in GOT. The Lannisters couldn't bury her entirely. And the snow on the statue is giving Sansa strength.

##Winterfell

Snow giving Sansa strength is further demonstrated by Sansa's building of Winterfell with snow.

&gt; What do I want with snowballs? She looked at her sad little arsenal.

Arsenal is a loaded word to describe snowballs. Here they are associated with weapons. 

&gt; I could build a snow knight instead, she thought. Or even . . .

Sansa's connection to the North is further strengthened when she discards the idea of making a knight but makes Winterfell instead. Snow has been giving her power so she channels it into making the castle. I believe the castle represents Sansa's identity,  house Stark and it's power. She takes great care to build the godswood of the castle. Ned calls the godswood the heart of the castle. Sansa again chooses to a Northern god and reaffirms her identity as a Stark. She does not build a sept. Littlefinger helps Sansa build the castle. Sansa built majority of the castle herself. Littlefinger helps her in building the garden and bridges. So Littlefinger won't change Sansa too much. He will only have a cosmetic effect on Sansa. 

She will remain Ned Stark's daughter and will reject the identity of Littlefinger's daughter.

&gt; ""May I come into your castle, my lady?""


&gt; Sansa was wary. ""Don't break it. Be . . . ""


&gt; "" . . . gentle?"" 

This is a sexual innuendo. Littlefinger will try to bed Sansa in the future but Sansa will be wary. 

&gt; He smiled. ""Winterfell has withstood flercer enemies than me. It is Winterfell, is it not?""


&gt;""Yes,"" Sansa admitted.

Littlefinger will fail in seducing her. In the previous Sansa chapter, he offers her a pomegranate. Persephone ate pomegranate seeds given by Hades and became his queen. Sansa however refuses to eat the fruit. This further hints at Littlefinger's failure.

&gt; Sansa stuck her fingers through the top, grabbed a handful of snow, and flung it full in his face. Petyr yelped, as the snow slid down under his collar. ""That was unchivalrously done, my lady.""


&gt; ""As was bringing me here, when you swore to take me home.""


&gt; She wondered where this courage had come from, to speak to him so frankly. From Winterfell, she thought. I am stronger within the walls of Winterfell.

The Snow Winterfell is providing her courage. Littlefinger helped shape it but Sansa would become untrusting of Littlefinger in the future books and start questioning him. This will be the beginning of the end.

&gt; You must be very cold. Let me warm you, Sansa. Take off those gloves, give me your hands.""


&gt; ""I won't.""

Refusal of marriage?

##Littlefinger

Littlefinger's family sigil is the titan of Braavos. Arya believes that the real Titan could step over the walls of Winterfell. 

&gt; he stepped over both walls with a single long stride

This sentence further strengthens the connection to him and the Titan. Sansa is associating Littlefinger with Marillion who tried to force himself on her.

&gt; He sounded almost like Marillion, the night he'd gotten so drunk at the wedding. 

She also believes that Lothor won't save her from Littlefinger and she must rescue herself. This is another rejection of southern chivalry.

&gt; Only this time Lothor Brune would not appear to save her; Ser Lothor was Petyr's man. ""You shouldn't kiss me. I might have been your own daughter . . . ""

The Ghost of High Heart has foretold that a maid will slay a savage giant near a snow castle. Sansa rips out Sweetrobin's doll out. This event seems to fulfill the prophecy but why would such an insignificant even be seen by the Ghost when she is seeing deaths of Kings? So, the doll is Littlefinger. Robin tries to break down Sansa's castle and

&gt; Swinging the doll by the legs, he knocked the top off one gatehouse tower and then the other.


&gt; It was more than Sansa could stand. ""Robert, stop that."" Instead he swung the doll again, and a foot of wall exploded. She grabbed for his hand but she caught the doll instead. There was a loud ripping sound as the thin cloth tore. Suddenly she had the doll's head, Robert had the legs and body, and the rag-and-sawdust stuffing was spilling in the snow.

This could point to a headless Littlefinger soon. 

Sansa also threw snow at him. Perhaps another hint to a beheading.

&gt;Petyr yelped, as the snow slid down under his collar. 

As all characters must pay the ironic price with their deaths, it would be very poetic if Sansa causes Littlefinger's beheading as he has caused Ned's beheading. It will be Cat *and* Sansa choosing Ned over Littlefinger. Poor guy.

&gt; She wondered if Lord Robert would shake all through their wedding. At least Joffrey was sound of body. A mad rage seized hold of her. She picked up a broken branch and smashed the torn doll's head down on top of it, then pushed it down atop the shattered *gatehouse* of her snow castle. 

Sansa is upset at the prospect of marriage and there is the Gatehouse which again has sexual innuendo. Gatehouse Ami Frey was famous for allowing anyone to enter her castle. However, Littlefinger's head causes the gatehouse to collapse. Another indication that he won't get into Sansa's smallclothes.

##Memories

&gt; It was the old days she hungered for. Prayed for.

Again the compass is pointing to the North.

&gt; She had last seen snow the day she'd left Winterfell. That was a lighter fall than this, she remembered. Robb had melting flakes in his hair when he hugged me, and the snowball Arya tried to make kept coming apart in her hands. It hurt to remember how happy she had been that morning. Hullen had helped her mount, and she'd ridden out with the snowflakes swirling around her

Childhood, family, Winterfell. Robb having snowflakes in the hair is Jon's last memory of Robb. 

&gt;  . She might even have caught her, but she'd slipped on some ice. Her sister came back to see if she was hurt. When she said she wasn't, Arya hit her in the face with another snowball, but Sansa grabbed her leg and pulled her down and was rubbing snow in her hair when Jory came along and pulled them apart, laughing

Arya is hilarious. Sansa is not remembering any of the countless fights with her sister but a happy memory. She even mused Arya's hair with snow just like Jon! I miss Jory.

&gt; The snow fell and the castle rose.

I've always been fascinated by the interplay between ASOIAF and real-world myth and history. The way GRRM drew on everything from Hadrian's wall to Manichaeism in his world-building is great. But I never expected that he'd allowed American history to influence the novels. 

But he did. **There lived a man named John Stark (seriously), whose life was nearly an exact copy of Jon Snow's** (exempting the supernatural, obviously). 

John Stark was a highly successful and decorated leader in the American French &amp; Indian War (7 years, to our European readers), and the American Revolution. 

Here's the chronology of the major history-worth events from his life, (4 &amp; 3 are switched). There's no way all these are coincidence: 

* Just going to throw this one out there first: John Stark's most famous quotation was was an exhortation to his troops which famously ended with ""Death is not the worst of evils"". Totally not applicable to ASOIAF, or Jon Snow.  Anyway, 

* He was born in the very northernmost area of his country, then, when 8, moved further north, to the absolute last area before the true wilderness. Wilderness famous for its harsh winters, virgin forests, and the hereditary enemies (the Indians &amp; Quebecois)of all Stark's people (English) who lived there. Small scalle border warfare was constant. 

* He joined a military group called 'Robert's *Rangers*', who existed to protect said frontier, and did so by manning border forts, and conducting long-range reconissance missions and raids in the wilderness. He rose to become the company's XO while still a young man.  

*  While in the wilderness, he was captured by a barbarian tribe (Indians), but, after an impressive feat of arms, won their respect, was spared punishment, and was made a member of their tribe. He returned to his frontier home, however. The Rangers would later fight the tribe who had captured him. 

* Full-scale war would break out. Therein, John Stark would distinguish himself by successfully defending a strategically vital fort.

* After the war, Stark resigned his commission with the Rangers. 

* Which was ok, because he would, when a different war regarding internal politics broke out around the provincial capital to the south, Stark raised an army of the frontier people, and rode to assist those assaulting it. 

Ok, here's about as far as the books go. But...wow, *that guy named John Stark sure seemed to do exactly what Jon Snow, son of a Stark did.* 

I now really, really want to go through and try to find any more American history that found its way into the book. If anyone else knows of any, please put it in a comment? Thanks!

And for what its worth, the rest of John Stark's career saw him

* Save those assaulting the capital, by stopping a crucial portion of the enemy's sally. 

* Then joined forces with the assaulting army, and fought for them both north and south of the frontier. Most notably, he won a resounding victory over foreign mercenaries that greatly contributed to a victory that proved the war's turning point. 

* After that, he, famously, settled down on the northern frontier, played no role in politics, and died old, safe and happy (a rarity there/then).

Melisandre mentions ""waking the dragon"" under Winterfell and since we know her visions aren't completely accurate, I think it's a reference to Dragonglass, instead. The hot springs have to be caused by something, like magma just under the surface. If my knowledge of science is correct (it is highly likely it isn't), then the Obsidian is formed when lava is cooled quickly (when it hits water). That's why it makes sense that Dragonstone (an island likely formed from volcano) has large deposits of the stuff. 

The deposits of Dragonglass in Winterfell would explain how the Children of the Forest had access to Dragonglass to give to the NW, what with their intricate tunnels all over the North.

Stannis, camped next to the lakes around Winterfell has fished the lakes dry, but I'm guessing he may accidentally fish up bits of Dragonglass. Or maybe someone will find stores in the crypts? When the Others head south, the men in the North would be able to use the Dragonglass to protect themselves.

1371488244.0,519,self.asoiaf,1giwte,(Spoilers All) The Last ~130 years of Stark Lords Explained,historyofwesteros,623,104,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1giwte/spoilers_all_the_last_130_years_of_stark_lords/,"Hello all.  It's past time that the History of Westeros podcast had a presence here on Reddit.  But we shan't resort to a simple ""hey, look at me"" tactics, no indeed.  We'll come correct with some fun content.

Starting with the Stark statues in the crypts and using scattered details from the books (including unreleased material), I believe I have a solid model of the Stark genealogy going back to the time of Aemon the Dragonknight.

From the text, Bran lists them off: ""Lord Rickard Stark, Lord Edwyle, Lord Willam and his brother Artos the Implacable, Lord Donner, Lord Beron, Lord Rodwell, one-eyed Lord Jonnel, Lord Barth, Lord Brandon, and Lord Cregan who fought Aemon the Dragonknight""

Given the reference to Aemon at the end of the passage, and Lord Rickard (Ned's father) and Lord Edwyle (Ned's grandfather) certainly being the most recent, and Artos/Willam certainly being correctly ordered after that, we have a solid foundation for the assumption that Bran's ordering is chronological.

We start with Lord Cregan, he who fought The Dragonknight and was said to be the finest swordsman he faced.  This, by the way is saying something.  In our History of the Kingsguard episode we point out that Aemon, based on content and number of mentions in the books, was likely one of the best ever. He fought in the Dornish Conquest, likely facing some of Dorne's best.  Interestingly, there is no reason to suggest Cregan ever fought Aemon in earnest.  Why would House Stark have fought House Targaryen during that time period?  The Dance of the Dragons was over before Aemon was born and the Blackfyre Rebellions began well after he died (and we don't even know whose side the Starks fought on in those wars, if any).  Unless there was another split or succession struggle, (certainly possible but suspiciously missing in reference if so), the likely answer is Aemon and Cregan fought in a tourney.  It is unlikely that the tourney happened during the reign of Baelor (161-171) as Baelor is extremely unlikely to have viewed tourneys as favorable and may have banned them.  Even if one did occur, Aemon likely wouldn't have participated, at least not while Baelor was alive, because of his loyalty to his brother and because Kingsguard knights aren't likely to travel far from their King to attend a tourney, if at all.  (an exception is when lesser members of the royal family travel to tourney a la D&amp;E 1).  So perhaps they fought in the early 170's, at a tourney celebrating Aemon’s *father* Viserys II's ascension. In a melee, they may have come face to face and fought. Another possibility is that they fought a duel, not to the death, but perhaps over a matter of honor akin to when Oberyn fought Lord Yronwood (though we know Lord Yronwood did actually die... ahh Red Viper).  

More: we know that the Skagosi rebelled ""about 100 years ago"" so roughly around AL 200.  We know that a Lord Stark died during this rebellion, and it would fit this timeline to insert Cregan as having died some time before this.  The Stark Lord who died to the Skagosi would be Brandon.

We know, from the teaser for the yet-unreleased 4th Dunk and Egg that five Lord Starks die in a short time, with the fifth slowly succumbing to his wounds.  This is during the time of Dagon Greyjoy's rebellion, which we know to be ~210-213.  We know that Lord Beron Stark was gathering swords to drive the Ironmen back (Dunk wants to gain employment there).  If the order is correct, Beron is the 4th of the 5 who die.  We know that a Lord Stark is dying when Dunk is actually arriving, so that would be Donner.

Following that in order we have the 3rd short termer as Lord Rodwell, then Lord Jonnel One-Eye and finally Lord Barth.  Beron and Donner almost certainly died to Dagon's Rebellion, but the next 3 could've died a number of ways.  The Great Spring Sickness is a likely culprit for Barth and maybe Jonnel, but it seems unlikely that it would kill all 3.  So perhaps Rodwell also died to Dagon, and perhaps all 5 of them!

Jonnel One-Eye is unlikely to have been Lord for long.  He is sandwiched in-between Barth who, if dead from the GSS, may have died from the GSS himself or early in Dagon's Rebellion.  Since the last 2 died during the rebellion it doesn't leave much time for Rodwell to have died in between them.  Keep in mind that it's also unlikely that three Lord Starks died during the GSS as the GSS is unlikely to have lasted more than a season or two.  

So the ""range"" on Stark Lords dying to the Great Spring Sickness is 0-2. 

This means Dagon is put down while Willam is Lord.  btw, it appears Artos the Implacable is Rickard's actual grandfather.  Since Artos became Lord and he was Willam's brother, Willam could not have had any male(any?) children.  It is certainly possible that Artos also died without male issue and the line passed to another Stark, however.  Other Starks may have been rare however, due to the apparent devastation caused by Dagon and the Sickness.  We'll call Artos as the direct ancestor ""moderately likely"".


**The Eleven Prior to Lord Eddard**

Cregan Stark - became Lord 171 or earlier and died no later than ~198 (we know his reign was ""long"" from a World of Ice and Fire fragment)

Brandon Stark - became Lord after Cregan's long reign, let's say ~196 and died to Skaggs ~200

Barth Stark - ~200 until dying ""recently"" from the perspective of people living ~212  Likely killed by the Great Spring Sickness or Dagon's Rebellion

Jonnel Stark One-Eye - became Lord and likely died soon after, same likely causes as Barth, (but not GSS if Barth died to DR)

Rodwell Stark - became Lord and likely died soon after, probably to Dagon's Rebellion

Beron Stark - ~212 became Lord and likely died within a year, to Dagon's Rebellion

Donner Stark - ~212 became Lord and died to Dagon's Rebellion

Willam Stark - ~213 became Lord, saw the end of Dagon's Rebellion and died at Long Lake to Raymun Redbeard, King Beyond-the-Wall.

Artos the Implacable became Lord Stark upon the battlefield death of his brother Willam, slaying Raymun and probably ruled at least 10 years.

Edwyle Stark - became Lord after Artos died, ruled for GRRM knows how long but likely before 272. 

Rickard Stark - became Lord ~272?, died in 282. Sounds like Rickard was Lord for a while, we'll guesstimate ~10 years.

The RPG claims the war against Raymun Redbeard was ~184 but this is disproven both by Jon's chapter which states that Raymun was around during the time of his grandfather's grandfather and by some of the non-assumptive parts of this post.  If ""grandfather's grandfather"" is taken literally that means Artos is an extremely strong candidate to be Jon's grandfather, and that notion fits this model precisely.  Willam couldn't have had any sons or Artos wouldn't have inherited, but it is possible Edwyle was the son of an unnamed younger brother of Willam/Artos, or a cousin.

This also goes a long way towards explaining why the Starks are not so numerous.  In addition to all the Stark Lords who died, it's a safe assumption that many other Starks died to similar causes, especially the plague.

The city is built upon the land they gave us. In return we swore that we should always be their men. Stark men![


That quote just gives me *chills.* And makes her one of many Northern women who are incomparable bad asses - Mormonts, Starks, Reeds, Manderlys and Karstarks.

She's not very pretty, she's quiet and afraid and lives in a cold household where her own father and mother rarely show her any sort of affection.

She's a very sad character and people love to pity her for it. Because the girl deserves some joy in her life.

The only thing that made her happy were myths and fairytales from before The Andal Invasion. Giants, Children of the Forest, the Old Gods, these things made her happy and one of the things she wanted to see in her life was any of those things.

But we all know that her life had just been a series of sad and depressing events that just keep piling up. 

So when she arrived at the The Wall and faced Wun Wun charging for her, i instantly thought how she was going to freak out and suffer dissapointment at learning that the giants that she's heard of were brutish, smelly, hairy, ugly and incomprehensable...

I was in for a pleasant suprise.

Instead of being afraid, she acts like she's in a candy shop and enthusiastically yells that it's a real Giant. Then she asks her mother if she can touch it.

I expected her to be afraid, to suffer yet another dissapointment... instead she marvels at the fact that she was able to *see* one, a creature that she only heard in stories and believed to be long gone from this world.

She doesn't care that it's large, brutish and smelly, she's just delighted to have actually seen a giant and lived to tell about it. Her dream had come true and she finds joy in this simple fact. It's not perfect, but she simpy doesn't care. She's happy.

We first encounter Brienne as a member of Renly Baratheon's Kingsguard. In her own way, Brienne is just as idealistic and romantic as Sansa Stark. She idolized Renly because he looked and acted like the perfect king (""Lord Renly... His Grace, he... he would have been the best king, my lady, he was so good, he...” ACOK 39/Catelyn V). Like Sansa, Brienne has a tendency to confuse surface for substance.

And like Littlefinger warned Sansa, Catelyn warned Brienne that life is not a song:

&gt;“...it will not last,” Catelyn answered, sadly. “Because they are the knights of summer, and winter is coming.”

&gt;“Lady Catelyn, you are wrong.” Brienne regarded her with eyes as blue as her armor. “Winter will never come for the likes of us. Should we die in battle, they will surely sing of us, and it’s always summer in the songs. In the songs all knights are gallant, all maids are beautiful, and the sun is always shining.”

&gt;Winter comes for all of us, Catelyn thought. For me, it came when Ned died. It will come for you too, child, and sooner than you like. She did not have the heart to say it. (ACOK 22/Catelyn II)

As Catelyn predicted, the song became a nightmare: Renly was assassinated and died in Brienne's arms, and she became known as a kingslayer. Later, she reflects on Catelyn's warning:

&gt;[Ser Hyle Hunt] “Ben died, you know. Cut down on the Blackwater. Farrow too, and Will the Stork. And Mark Mullendore took a wound that cost him half his arm.”

&gt;Good, Brienne wanted to say. Good, he deserved it. But she remembered Mullendore sitting outside his pavilion with his monkey on his shoulder in a little suit of chainmail, the two of them making faces at each other. What was it Catelyn Stark had called them...? The knights of summer. And now it was autumn and they were falling like leaves...(AFFC 14/Brienne III)

Like Sansa, Brienne becomes disillusioned about chivalry and romance. For Sansa, Ser Loras represented the chivalric ideal (beautiful, young, gallant), but Sandor Clegane (ugly, old, disgraced, discourteous) eventually came to dominate her thoughts and fantasies much more than Loras. For Brienne, this disillusionment is marked by the displacement of Renly (the chivalric ideal) in her thoughts with Jaime (a disgraced knight).

For Brienne, Jaime has literally begun to replace Renly. Here's a scene in AFFC in which Brienne wishes Jaime was with her. Then she seemingly tries to convince herself that who she really wants is Renly (yeah right):

&gt;Would that Jaime had come with me, she thought ... but he was a knight of the Kingsguard, his rightful place was with his king. Besides, it was Renly that she wanted. I swore I would protect him, and I failed. Then I swore I would avenge him, and I failed at that as well (AFFC 20/Brienne IV)

Brienne has also had two dreams in which Renly actually turns into Jaime. The first:

&gt;That night she dreamed herself in Renly’s tent again...Something was moving through green darkness...hurtling toward her king. She wanted to protect him...when the shadow sword sliced through the green steel gorget and the blood began to flow, she saw that the dying king was not Renly after all but Jaime Lannister, and she had failed him. (AFFC 9/Brienne II)

The second (Please note the reference to [roses](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dmz7p/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/), as it will come up again):

&gt;Loras Tyrell had been the last to face her wroth that day. He’d never courted her...but he bore three golden roses on his shield that day, and Brienne hated roses. The sight of them had given her a furious strength. She went to sleep dreaming of the fight they’d had, and of Ser Jaime fastening a rainbow cloak about her shoulders (AFFC Ch 20/Brienne IV).

So why does Jaime start replacing Renly in Brienne's mind?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
**II. Honor among Kingslayers**

While they were traveling together, Brienne often threw Jaime's oathbreaking in his face (“Your oaths are worthless. You swore an oath to Aerys.” ASOS 21/Jaime III). She was naive and idealistic. But in AFFC Brienne learned just how difficult it is to keep the oaths she's made. She's started to understand what Jaime had been telling her in ASOS about the oaths of knighthood:

&gt;“I will find the girl and keep her safe,” Brienne had promised Ser Jaime...“For her lady mother’s sake. And for yours.” Noble words, but words were easy. Deeds were hard. (AFFC 4/Brienne I)

Jaime, on the other hand, seems to have more faith in Brienne, He described Brienne's quest as his last chance for redemption:

&gt;“I have made kings and unmade them. Sansa Stark is my last chance for honor.” Jaime smiled thinly. “Besides, kingslayers should band together. (ASOS 72/Jaime IX)

Their destinies are intertwined. Like Jaime, Brienne started out as a member of a kingsguard. Like Jaime, she became notorious as a kingslayer and an oathbreaker. Like Jaime, her reputation is undeserved. Like Jaime, Brienne swore an oath to find Sansa Stark. And like Jaime, Brienne considers her oath to Catelyn a chance to redeem herself for failing in her duty as kingsguard. 

To be clear, Jaime doesn't feel guilty because he killed Aerys:

&gt;“Your oaths are worthless. You swore an oath to Aerys.”

&gt;“You haven’t cooked anyone in their armor so far as I know (ASOS 21/Jaime III)

.

&gt;“The Kingslayer, yes. The oathbreaker who murdered poor sad Aerys Targaryen.” Jaime snorted. “It’s not Aerys I rue, it’s Robert.... (ASOS 37/Jaime V)

Jaime feels guilty about having failed to protect Rhaegar's wife and children who were innocents (I'll discuss this more later). *That* was the true violation of his oath as kingsguard. Finding Sansa, another innocent, is his last chance at recovering some shred of honor. Brienne too feels guilty about failing to keep her own oath as a kingsguard. She has channeled her initial passion to avenge Renly's death into her quest to find Sansa. Sansa has come to symbolize a chance for both kingslayers to redeem their honor by finally managing to fulfill an oath to protect the innocent:

&gt;[Brienne] held [Oathkeeper] and said a silent prayer to the Crone, whose golden lamp showed men the way through life. Lead me, she prayed, light the way before me, show me the path that leads to Sansa. She had failed Renly, had failed Lady Catelyn. She must not fail Jaime. He trusted me with his sword. He trusted me with his honor. (AFFC 4/Brienne I)

But Brienne's quest to find Sansa is not only motivated by the desire to redeem herself for failing Renly. Her chapters in AFFC demonstrate that she very strongly connects her quest with redeeming Jaime's honor. She has a fever dream that is quite revealing:

&gt;She could not fight without her magic sword. Ser Jaime had given it to her. The thought of failing him as she had failed Lord Renly made her want to weep. “My sword. Please, I have to find my sword.” (AFFC 42/Brienne VIII)

Why should Brienne care so much about Jaime's sword or failing the Kingslayer?

It made me chuckle how once again Melisandre sees the truth but then goes on to disregard it.

&gt;Stannis: (paraphrased) Melisandre told me to come to Storm's End to win my brother's forces etc.

&gt;Davos: ""B-but"", Davos stammered, ""Lord Renly only came here because you had laid siege to his castle. He was marching toward King's Landing before, against the Lannisters, he would have--""

&gt;Stannis shifted in his seat, frowning. ""Was, would have, what is that? He did what he did. He came here with his banners and his peaches, to his doom... and it was well for me he did. **Melisandre saw another day in her flames as well. A morrow where Renly rode out of the south in his green armor to smash my host beneath the walls of King's Landing. Had I met my brother there, it might have been me who died in place with him.**.

He then goes on to explain how the same present can cast mutliple shadows ladida, but I think he made a mistake there. Melisandre did indeed see someone in **Renly's Armor** smashing his army with a host from the south. Namely Garlan Tyrell when the Tyrells and the Lannisters come to smash Stannis' forces in the battle of Blackwater Bay. She saw the future but was not smart enough to see that **both** her visions would come true.

Just thought Id' throw that out there, maybe I'm misreading it, but it would be rather cool if that was the case.

It had come open as it fell, and a few pages had gotten muddy, including one with a rather nice picture of Balerion the Black Dread done in colored inks.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Tyrion later mentions a book while on the Shy Maid:
&gt; &gt;And of course there was even less chance of his coming on the fragmentary, anonymous, blood-soaked tome sometimes called *Blood and Fire* and sometimes *The Death of Dragons*, the only surviving copy of which was supposedly hidden away in a locked vault beneath the Citadel.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Both books contain the words ""Death of Dragons"", are these two books the same?

 No.  Different books.

&gt; Another related question I don't expect you to answer (not part of our bet anyways)... Is the Alchemist at the Citadel to get that rare book Tyrion mentions?

 Interesting thought.

She honestly believe she is doing what is right, although that is not what I wanted to talk about.

I wanted to ask you all on what you think about Mel being undead, much like The Lightling Lord, and Lady Stoneheart. The evidence is circumstantial at best, but it would answer a lot of questions.

First and foremost, there is the fact the Mel needs neither to eat, nor sleep. She says this is because her God give her all the nourishment she needs, but if I remember correctly, Arya mentions never seeing Berric eat. She also mentions seeing Berric close his eyes for a time, but she got the feeling he wasn't sleeping. She may not even been lying when she says ""my God provides me the nourishment I need"". She would have been revived by R'hollor magic, so from a certain point of view, that would fit.

She is also implied to be very old, but she appears much younger than she is. Honestly, there is little evidence to support being undead makes you ageless, besides this:in what works of fiction do the undead age?

She also seems to struggler recalling her life before she became Mel, besides she was a slave girl named Melony, and sold on lot Seven. We knows people raised as a R'hollor wight lose some of their memory.

She doesn't get cold at the wall, again not strong evidence, but interesting.

Now, for a counterpoint, she was able to go on the other side of the wall, which wights aren't supposed to do. But, if she is undead, she is certainally of the R'hollor type, so I think that could explain that. And the fact that she never mentions being undead, perhaps she might not even know.

So, extrapolating on this theory, I think that if Mel DOES adminster the kiss of Unlife on Jon, she will lose her own unlife, ala The Lightning Lord.

So there ya go, I didn't really want to post this due to the fact that it is tinfoilly, but I believe it is less tinfoilly than other theories, although admittedly more tinfoilly than some.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,,True,t3_1b56ua,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1b56ua/spoilers_alla_theory_on_melisandre/,
1358887425.0,493,self.asoiaf,172rbe,[Spoilers All] Physical and Mental Illness in ASOIAF,saskatch,556,63,255,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/172rbe/spoilers_all_physical_and_mental_illness_in_asoiaf/,"Here is my attempt at medically diagnosing the characters in ASOIAF. This has probably already been discussed in detail, but I don't think I've seen it before.

I know I'm overanalyzing these characters, but sometimes I just enjoy thinking about the world of ASOIAF through the lens of modern knowledge. Many of these characters might not really suffer from these exact illnesses, but rather suffer from magical, or ""literary"" diseases. There isn't really any point to this thread, I just thought it might provide insight into some of the characters. I have no background or knowledge in medicine or psychology, so take everything I say with a grain of salt and offer your own opinion.

**Characters:**

* Hodor - Hodor is usually referred to as 'simple minded,' but evidenced by his otherwise high-functioning abilities, he likely suffers from a lesion on the [Broca's area of his brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Broca#Speech_research). His case is similar to that of a man named Leborgne, who had progressive loss of speech and paralysis but not a loss of comprehension nor mental function. He was nicknamed ""Tan"" due to his inability to clearly speak any words other than ""tan."" Also, I'm pretty sure the creators of the TV show know that Hodor has a lesion on his brain, because they gave him a scar on the front right part of his head, which you can see in [this picture](http://stuffpoint.com/game-of-thrones/image/18921-game-of-thrones-kristian-nairn-hodor.jpg). So even though we don't hear the story of how Hodor was injured, we can assume he suffered head trauma as an infant.

* Gregor Clegane - Judging by his enormous size and anger issues, Gregor probably suffers from [acromegaly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromegaly), a condition caused by a disorder of the pituitary gland and often associated with [gigantism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigantism). We also know that Gregor often drank excessive amounts of milk of the poppy, and suffered from debilitating head pain, which is also a known symptom of acromegaly.

* Joffrey Baratheon - I believe the medical term that best describes Joffrey is ""a little shit."" He is seemingly incapable of empathy, which we can tell by his mutilation of cats, as well as his torture of Tommen. It's difficult to dismiss him as an immature kid, because he perfectly fits the profile of a [sociopath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder): superficial charm, manipulativeness, egotism, lying, lack of remorse and empathy, poor impulse control and other behavioral problems. Some of his issues could possibly be attributed to his incestuous genetics. Cersei also seems to fit this profile pretty well, but I think she's just a crazy, manipulative bitch.

* Mad King Aerys / The Targaryens - After the Defiance of Duskendale, we know that Aerys became increasingly jealous, suspicious, cruel, and prone to furious outbursts. He may have suffered from any number of mental illnesses, which he (and other Targaryens) could be predisposed to due to inbreeding. His craziness could have been caused by [dementia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia), paranoid schizophrenia, or something else. Though we don't hear a lot about STD's in Westeros, his mental degradation matches the symptoms of [syphilis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis) (the pox?), and we know he developed some strange sexual behaviors in his later years. Another interesting possibility is that he suffers from the same affliction that [Mad King George](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom) did: [Porphyria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyria), which is a blood disease that affects the nervous system, resulting in hallucinations, depression, anxiety and paranoia. This would make a lot of sense because it draws a parallel between the two Mad Kings.

* Lysa Tully - Throughout the books, Lysa experiences some pretty drastic mood swings. She goes from being scared to vengeful to narcissistic all within one chapter, so I think it's possible that she is [bipolar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder).

* Robert Arryn - We know that Robin is afflicted with frequent seizures and is constantly bled by his maester. His disease is referred to as the 'shaking sickness,' so the real world diagnosis is most likely [epilepsy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy), possibly combined with panic attacks.

* Sansa - Sansa's behavior in the first couple of books is likely attributed to the psychological trauma of having her father and dire wolf killed, indicating she would today be diagnosed with [Posttraumatic stress disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder).

* Tyrion - Obviously, Tyrion was born with sporadic [achondroplasia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achondroplasia_in_children), the most common form of dwarfism. While psychological issues sometimes accompany this, Tyrion is clearly capable and intelligent, but could be described as having an addictive personality.

* Maester Aemon - If I remember correctly, Aemon's death is attributed to 'a chill' which likely corresponds to [pneumonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia), evidenced by his cough, fever, and difficulty breathing, brought on by the cold climate.

* Gyles Rosby - Rosby is constantly coughing blood into a handkerchief, indicating he has some sort of respiratory condition. It may be [tuberculosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis), but the fact that he wasn't contagious makes that unlikely. He probably died from [lung cancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer), or [chronic bronchitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_bronchitis).

* Ramsay Bolton - Ramsay is fucked in the head. His obsession with mutilation could fuel speculation about [psychosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis) or psychopathy, but in reality, he could be suffering from any number of mental illnesses. His mental issues may have stemmed from traumatic childhood experiences. 

* Reek - The original Reek, who is described as having an awful smell, could have been born with [trimethylaminuria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimethylaminuria), a metabolic disorder that causes a defect in the production of a certain enzyme, causing a strong fishy odor to be released in sweat, urine, and breath. Or, like everyone says, maybe he has just never taken a bath.

* Theon Greyjoy - Theon may have suffered from [manic depressive disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) due to his experience being captured and warding for the Starks. After his capture by Ramsay, Theon seems to develop [Stockholm syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome). As Reek, he identifies and sympathizes with his captor and even comes to have positive feelings toward him, sometimes to the point of defending his actions.

* Manderly and Illyrio - These guys suffer from obesity, and Illyrio's frequent urination stops could point to adult onset [diabetes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus).

* Hoster Tully - Hoster probably just died of old age, but his referencing the ""crabs in his stomach"" hints at the fact that he could have died from [stomach cancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer). 

* Khal Drogo - Drogo died from a 'festered wound' which is simply the equivalent to [septicemia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis).

* Rhaego - According to Mirri Maz Duur, Danaerys' stillborn child Rhaego had scales like a lizard, was blind with bat-like wings, and had innards full of graveworms. She also says that when she touched him, his skin fell away from his bones. According to Mirri Maz Duur, the deformity had a magical explanation, but his description matches that of a baby born with [harlequin ichthyosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequin-type_ichthyosis) (kind of NSFL), a congenital skin disease that causes scaly skin, and cranial deformities.

**Various Diseases:**

* Greyscale - When greyscale infects children, it generally leaves children malformed and disabled, but still alive. It is revealed to be generally fatal to adults. The disease is contracted by touch and slowly turns the flesh of the victim to ""stone."" It is said that the disease also drives its adult victims insane. Based on it's description, Greyscale seems to have elements of [leprosy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy) and possibly congenital [ichthyosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyosis).

* The Grey Plague - So far, we haven't heard a lot about the symptoms of The Grey Plague, but we know it is a very virulent disease with a high fatality rate. The Grey Plague wiped out half the city of Oldtown and Lord Quenton Hightower successfully prevented its spread by barring the gates and burning the ships. It seems to be a parallel to the [Black Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death) or [Bubonic Plague](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague).

* Redspots - Redspots is diagnosed by little spots on the skin, and having it once as a child gives you immunity. We know that it is substantially more severe for adults than for children. This is the disease Arianne faked for Myrcella's double in AFFC. It is basically the equivalent to [chicken pox]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenpox), but also seems a little bit like [measles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles).

* The Pox - The pox is described as some sort of sexually transmitted disease. In the books, Merrett Frey catches the pox from a whore and spreads it through Lord Crakehall's camp. We also hear about a whore who gives some of Randyll Tarly's men the pox. Based on its description and classification as a ""pox,"" it's real world equivalent is likely [syphilis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis) or [herpes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviridae).

* The Bloody Flux - The bloody flux, also known as the Pale Mare is a disease that spreads easily and quickly. It's symptoms are fever, intestinal hemorrhages, and diarrhea. The only known treatment in the books is quarantine, and it is mentioned as being able to kill three out of four men in armies. The bloody flux is definitely [dysentery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysentery), which was actually historically known as the bloody flux.

* Greywater fever - In the books, greywater fever seems to be associated with swampy areas, indicating that it's probably a waterborne illness. I think the only case of greywater fever we hear about was when we learn that Jojen nearly died of it as a child and afterwards woke with the gift of greensight. Since there aren't any descriptions of the symptoms of greywater fever, there isn't a lot to go off of, so I'll just go out on a limb and say that it's [Typhoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_fever) fever.

* Great Spring Sickness - The Great Spring Sickness was a mysterious plague epidemic that killed tens of thousands of people, mostly in major cities like King's Landing, Lannisport, and Oldtown. Again, we don't hear much about the specifics of the disease, and I haven't read Dunk &amp; Egg yet, so I don't know what  to say about this one. Any ideas?

Ramsay flayed the skin off several of Theon's fingers and toes, leaving them skinless for at least a few days until Theon begged for their removal.  
During this time, Theon was kept in a dungeon. I can't imagine that Ramsay was one to focus on the upkeep and cleanliness of his cells. They would have been filthy and damp, a perfect breeding ground for infection. And yet, even with what were undoubtedly weeping and open wounds, Theon manages to escape infection.   
He feeds on rats, eating raw meat and chewing on the fur and skin, which would have been absolutely filthy, and yet he suffers no fatal effects.  
  
He endures moat cailin, and the dangerous waters there, then spends time with men dying of horrible poison, with no ill effects.

That Theon has strength cannot be disputed. I'm thinking he might have endured, at the hand's of Ramsay, countless deaths.

Harys' squire taunts the bloody mummers and gets killed. Harys is forced to hug and kiss Vargo Hoat to make up for the argument.

During the Battle of the Blackwater, Ser Harys spends most of the battle under his horse. He is eventually rescued by a man named Willit.

1362999636.0,481,self.asoiaf,1a2qwt,"(Spoilers All) Complete Analysis of Quaithe's First Prophecy (To go north, you must journey south...)",galanix,555,74,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1a2qwt/spoilers_all_complete_analysis_of_quaithes_first/,"###THE PROPHECY
I'm recapping all the mentions of the prophecy in this section, if you're already familiar just skip ahead to the next section. The prophecy (in **bold**) is first uttered when Quaithe talks to Dany in Qarth:

&gt;“**To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.**”  
*Asshai*, Dany thought. *She would have me go to Asshai*. “Will the Asshai’i give me an army?” she demanded. “Will there be gold for me in Asshai? Will there be ships? What is there in Asshai that I will not find in Qarth?”  
“Truth,” said the woman in the mask. And bowing, she faded back into the crowd.

^(ACOK 40: DAENERYS III)

Dany hears the prophecy again (verbatim) while on-board *Balerion* docked outside Astapor, although Quaithe is nowhere to be seen. (ASOS 27: DAENERYS III, the chapter when she sacks Astapor)

Quaithe appears to Dany once more in Meereen on her terrace. She presents her longer prophecy first (i.e. pale mare, mummer's dragon, perfumed seneschal, etc.), but afterwards the original prophecy is referenced once more:

&gt;“If you have some warning for me, speak plainly. What do you want of me, Quaithe?”
Moonlight shone in the woman’s eyes. “To show you the way.”  
“I remember the way. **I go north to go south, east to go west, back to go forward. And to touch the light I have to pass beneath the shadow.**” She squeezed the water from her silvery hair. “I am half-sick of riddling. In Qarth I was a beggar, but here I am a queen. I command you—”  
“*Daenerys*. Remember the Undying. Remember who you are.”

^(ADWD 11: DAENERYS II)

I don't think it's significant, but Dany actually does have north and south reversed when she repeats it back here. The prophecy is only ever referenced one more time, but I'll get to that in a later section.

***
###THE GEOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION
The most common interpretation of this prophecy is that people think Dany is going to go southeast to get to the northwest (Westeros), and pass under the Shadow Lands (a region near Asshai). It is frequently speculated that Dany will go towards Asshai and around the world reaching Westeros from the east over the Sunset Sea. This is supported by the first mention of the prophecy (see above) where Dany speculates that Quaithe is implying she head to Asshai, and Quaithe responds by saying she will find ""truth"" there. Another variation on this theory involves Dany recovering the true Lightbringer sword (""touch the light"") near Asshai.

[Let's look at a map of their known world to get a sense of where Asshai is (official map preview from *The Lands of Ice and Fire*).](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2013/060/8/a/world_of_ice_and_fire_by_torstan-d5wmiv7.jpg)

Asshai is located at the tip of the peninsula at the bottom-right and the Shadow Lands are the purplish mountain region directly northeast of it on the peninsula. So taking that route would fill many of the requirements of the prophecy, as you would pass under the Shadow Lands.

However, we can see that going to Asshai from Meereen alone is just as long a journey as going to Westeros from Meereen. They also have no idea what is east of Asshai and whether it even connects to the Sunset Sea. Plus GRRM has been asked if we will see Asshai and responded:

&gt;Only in flasback and memory, if at all.

[^(So Spake Martin: July 27, 2008)](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2997)

Considering the lengthy journey east and Asshai's location at the opening to the strait, it would be absurd for Dany to not stop by there if that was indeed her route. If GRRM was planning as early as ACOK for Dany to head east around Asshai, then I don't think he would have said we won't see Asshai as of 2008 (post-AFFC, pre-ADWD). So this interpretation is *highly* unlikely.

I have heard other various geographic interpretations of the prophecy which involve locations on Westeros. Like to get to the Wall (north) she must first go to Dorne (south). A lot of things along those lines, but I've never seen an entire cohesive theory about it, nor seen it supported in any convincing way beyond speculation.

***
###THE DANY-X INTERPRETATION
As far as I know I'm the first person to have this specific interpretation of the prophecy so I'm coining it the 'Dany-X Interpretation' as it has to do with Dany's tenth ADWD chapter. As I said in the first section there is one last mention of the prophecy, which occurs in Dany's final ADWD chapter while she is dreaming:

&gt;“**To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward, you must go back. To touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.**”  
“Quaithe?” Dany called. “Where are you, Quaithe?”  
Then she saw. *Her mask is made of starlight.*  
“Remember who you are, Daenerys,” the stars whispered in a woman’s voice. “The dragons know. Do you?”

^(ADWD 71: DAENERYS X)

And wouldn't you know it almost all of the prophecy occurs either figuratively or literally (sometimes both) in this very chapter. The remaining quotes are all from this chapter.

##TO REACH THE NORTHWEST...
The northwest for the prophecy represents Westeros, or in a more figurative sense Dany's ultimate goal or fate; her fated destination if you will.

##YOU MUST JOURNEY SOUTHEAST.
She begins the chapter in Drogon's lair which she is calling Dragonstone. She wants to get back to Meereen and so looks for a stream in hopes that it leads to the Skahazadhan, which she can follow downstream to Meereen. She finds a stream, and what direction does she walk along it?

&gt;The stream was trickling **south by southeast**, as near as she could tell. She followed it. *Take me to the river, that is all I ask of you. Take me to the river, and I will do the rest.*

##YOU MUST PASS BENEATH THE SHADOW...
The shadow represents either Drogon himself (given his dark coloring) or the literal shadow he casts:

&gt;The second time he passed before the sun, **his black wings spread, and the world darkened**. The last time **he flew right above her**, so close she could hear the sound of his wings. For half a heartbeat Dany thought that he was hunting her, but he flew on without taking any notice of her and vanished somewhere in the east. Just as well, she thought.

Here Dany literally passes beneath Drogon's shadow. In a figurative sense, I think Dany passing ""beneath the shadow"" represents her passing the trials necessary to gain Drogon's trust (e.g. living with him, eating with him, etc.).

##TO TOUCH THE LIGHT.
The light is represented by the sky; the sunlight and starlight in the sky to be more precise. When she hears the prophecy in this chapter and looks for Quaithe, she appears as stars in the sky:

&gt;“Where are you, Quaithe?”
*Then she saw. Her mask is made of starlight.*  

There is another mention of the Sun and stars a few paragraphs later:

&gt;The sun was only just coming up. A few bright stars lingered in the cobalt sky. *Perhaps one of them is Khal Drogo, sitting on his fiery stallion in the night lands and smiling down on me.*

The sky is the light, and to touch the light means flying Drogon in the sky. Now she does fly Drogon previously, but in an uncontrolled manner. This was the first chapter where she started to gain control flying Drogon:

&gt;She kicked him, and Drogon threw himself into the sky. Her whip was gone, so she used her hands and feet and turned him north by east, the way the scout had gone. Drogon went willingly enough; perhaps he smelled the rider’s fear.

##TO GO FORWARD, YOU MUST GO BACK.

This line actually has two meanings. The first meaning is a directional one that Dany directly references in the chapter:

&gt;Dany leapt onto his back. She stank of blood and sweat and fear, but none of that mattered. “**To go forward I must go back**,” she said. Her bare legs tightened around the dragon’s neck. 

She is heading due south along the stream at this point and decides to go after the Dothraki scout due north. Thus she is going back to kill the scout, so that she may move forward towards Meereen.

The other meaning behind the line is looking at 'forward' and 'back' in a temporal sense. The Dothraki and Jhaqo are experiences that are very much behind her at this point. But in order to go forward on her journey she must go back and revisit the Dothraki as she does at the end of this chapter.

It also represents Dany going against her previous instincts. A line that Dany oft repeats is ""*If I look back I am lost*"". She says it twice this chapter, and eight other times in the novels (even as early as AGOT). And if you look at Dany's story arc, she pretty much never goes backwards. From being born on Dragonstone, to Braavos with Willem Darry, to Pentos with Illyrio, to the Dothraki, to Qarth, to Astapor, to Yunkai, to Meereen, and to Dragonstone (Drogon's lair, although the Dragonstone to Dragonstone thing is interesting as well). Never going backwards. Yet in this final chapter she finally comes upon a Dothraki horde from her past.

##CONCLUSION/TL;DR

So here is a concise summary of the prophecy as I interpret it:

|PROPHECY|INTERPRETATION
|:-|:-
|To go north [&amp;] reach the west|To reach Westeros and achieve your goals
|you must journey south [&amp;] go east|you must follow the stream southeast.
|To go forward, you must go back|Move forward by revisiting the Dothraki in your past.
|To touch the light|To learn to fly your dragon
|you must pass beneath the shadow|you must earn Drogon's trust and pass his trials.

This is fitting with the comments surrounding the prophecy as well. Quaithe says she wants to 'show Dany the way'. She also mentions that Dany needs to 'remember who she is' (the Mother of Dragons) and that 'the dragons know' who she is. It all fits with the prophecy being about Dany learning to ride her dragon and revisiting her Dothraki past in order to reach Westeros. This could also be linked to the [Stallion Who Mounts the World](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stallion_Who_Mounts_the_World) prophecy, which many speculate is about Drogon (""As swift as the wind he rides..."").

Quick summary:

-Warden of the West Daven Lannister is betrothed to a Frey girl 

-The wedding is to take place in Riverrun, the newly-gained seat of Walder Frey's second son Emmon and his wife Genna Lannister 

-Tom of Sevenstreams, listed in the book Appendix as still a part of UnCat's Brotherhood, has successfully and easily infiltrated Riverrun 

-Daven joked that he will definitely marry his Frey fiancee because he knows what happened to Robb Stark 

-Paranoid Emmon swore that ""no man shall ever take it [Riverrun] from me""

All in all, it sounds pretty goddamn ominous. UnCat would take the greatest pleasure in crashing a Frey-Lannister Wedding at her stolen family's home. 

I think that this will be made even more potentially glorious in the Show: 

-In S3E10, Lord Walder states that *he* is now the titled Lord of Riverrun. 

-Not only that, but he says he needs to find a new bride (because Cat so happened to murder his old one). 

Could the showrunners have ~~Argus Filch~~ Walder and his wedding replace the above Books' plotline? 

I say yes. Everyone fucking hates Walder Frey (I still find him hilarious tho). We've been waiting for this guy to get his, and show-watchers will have the same bloodlust. No one is 100% satisfied with the hangings of Nameless Freys #24-30. There are [93 Freys still alive, heh](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/16mqp1/spoilers_all_complete_guide_to_westerosi/c7xvupd) 

I think it would be fitting if in mayhaps S6, his marriage to his new bride is crashed by Lady Stoneheart. It would give show-watchers, and readers, a nice dose of poetic vengeance.

1374110114.0,479,self.asoiaf,1ij093,(Spoilers All) Jaime Lannister and the Philosophy of Ethics,Lord_Varys,570,91,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1ij093/spoilers_all_jaime_lannister_and_the_philosophy/,"A Song of Ice and Fire is great for so many reasons.  One of those factors, for me, is the character development.  A girl becomes a boy; a boy becomes no one.  A highborn lady becomes a bastard.  A bastard becomes Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.

Another factor contributing to Martin’s legend is the commentary that the novels provide on morality and ethics.  We get an exploration of the area between “morally black” and “morally white” in the hearts and souls of every character.  Can anything else really be said about Martin’s masterful navigation of “the grey area”?

Well, I’ll give it a shot.  

A sublime collision of both factors takes place in the character arc of Jaime Lannister.  Yes, he went from one of the purest villains in the story to a fan favorite in one book, without a cheap revelation of him faking it - just character development, history, and exploration.

But that’s only part of it.

**Jaime Lannister, to me, is the ultimate commentary (case study, perhaps) on two of the most prevalent ethical theories that exist today – Utilitarianism and Kantianism.**

--------------

Some background to get you started (definitions pulled from Wikipedia):

- **Utilitarianism:** A theory in normative ethics holding that the proper course of action is the one that maximizes utility, usually defined as maximizing happiness and reducing suffering for the greatest number of people.

- **Kantianism:**  An ethical theory holding that actions are to be performed in accordance with some underlying maxim or principle, the Categorical Imperative; it is according to this that the moral worth of any action is judged.  The *Categorical Imperative* is a Kantian term which loosely means “universal duty.”  

**In short, Utilitarianism vs Kantianism can be summarized in one question: *The ends, or the means*?**  

To a Utilitarian, the end can justify the means. I think the ultimate example of Utilitarian ethics in the Song of Ice and Fire is Tywin Lannister.

&gt;*”Explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10,000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner.”*  

This is the man who engineered the Red Wedding, but Gods if you can’t at least see his side of the story!  Here is perhaps the most gruesome, chaotic, heartbreaking moment any writer has ever penned, but can’t you see things from Tywin’s perspective?  Is there not some validity to the point he’s trying to make?

The end cannot justify the means to a pure Kantian.  Davos, as the angel on Stannis’ shoulder, is the prime example here:

&gt;*”What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?”*

&gt;*”**Everything.**”*

A Kingdom won without honor is not worth winning.  Note that in Kantianism, it is not *completely* centered around protecting innocent life, but rather that innocent life and natural rights cannot be violated as a means to an end.  For example, Stannis might have been able to end the war, saving countless innocent lives, by sacrificing Edric.  But by treating Edric as a *means* to that end, you violate the categorical imperative.

---------------

Jaime Lannister had always been, first, a utilitarian.  Understandably so - he learned from the best, Tywin, and his experiences demanded it.  It started with the killing of the Mad King.  Jaime broke his holy vows to save tens of thousands of lives.  

As a Knight of the Kingsguard, it is his duty, his categorical imperative, to execute the King’s orders.  Serve.  Obey.  Protect.  Recall that Barristan comments on how he has done things he was ashamed of, but it was his *duty* to obey a King, even if that King was evil.  What we see here is an *extreme* case which pushes the boundaries of ethical thought to their furthest limits.  Still, he violates this duty so that he might minimize suffering for the greatest number of people.  Let me stress that this is obviously an incredibly difficult situation that would likely break the resolve of even the most devoted Kantian.  It is almost a traumatic experience that altered his decision making for the rest of his life.

Accordingly, when we first meet Jaime, he follows the same utilitarian rules – though he claims he acted impulsively (I would guess there is a pinch of sarcasm in this admission), his attempted murder of Bran is another *perfect* example of valuing the ends with little account for the means.  “If I push this boy out of the window, how many thousands of lives will I save?”  There is a risk that his secret could be exposed, and if that happens, how many countless lives will be lost in the ensuing war?  Honorable Ned and righteous Stannis will not accept Joffrey.  Should Bran say anything, it could mean a war for the throne.  *What is the life of one innocent boy against a kingdom?*  Nothing, to Jaime, at this point.  Bran’s life is a means to a worthy end.

But Jaime changes.  Between Riverun and King’s Landing, he becomes a new person.  Perhaps the change is not immediate, but his experience with Brienne and his fall from hubris are the catalysts.  There is still an internal struggle after he is returned to King’s Landing.  He returns to Cersei and has one last moment of weakness in the sept.  But as she bows her head over his in the White Tower of the Kingsguard, he finally takes his stand.  He realizes his “Categorical Imperative”.

He stops Cersei.  He is the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, and he has a duty; helping her in her time of need – accepting her offer to be Hand of the King – would mean breaking it.

Not only does he recommit to his duty, but living vicariously through Brienne, he swears to uphold his oath and return Sansa Stark, the ultimate symbol of innocent life in this story, to safety.  We have not seen much of the new Jaime as of yet, but we know that in rejecting his sister completely and coming to terms with his role as Lord Commander, he has thrown his old life away.  He is committed to a new kind of honor.  He is committed to his categorical imperative.

---------

The most difficult moral questions in these books tend to revolve around how a character acts when an innocent life is in their hands.  Davos, Ned, and Jon tend to be considered the most “honorable”, “good”, or “virtuous” characters in the book, and it is largely due to the way they treat innocent life (Edric; Daenerys, Cersei’s children, and his own; the old man in the Gift, respectively).  Tywin and Roose tend to be considered evil, but they are really only acting rationally in the best interest of their family, and in fact seem to try to minimize the total number of lives lost to a prolonged war.  Does this mean “Kantianism = Good, Utilitarianism = Bad?”  No, absolutely not.  Kantianism has plenty of problems.  Ned’s precious honor (not capturing Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen) enabled the war.  Davos’ smuggling of Edric prolonged it.  Jon’s insistence on fortifying Hardhome and allowing thousands of useless Wildlings pass through the Wall (granted, *some* are useful, though less than half) appear to be foolish attempts to save innocent lives at the expense of a more probable survival.  How often did your heart cry out for Dany to turn a blind eyes to her thousands of starving, pox-ridden children?  Both sides are valid in their own way.

What I see in Jaime Lannister is a battle between two of these competing ethical philosophies.  I see a man struggling with one of the great philosophical debates of our time.  Do we sacrifice rights to privacy if it means saving lives from terrorism?  Do we permit people to smoke cigarettes even though it will cost lives and money?  *Do the ends justify the means?*

While our opinion of him as a character changes, he himself changes as well, and that process is independent of our opinions.  What I mean is that even when he still has a hand, we start to like him more, and even if he never lost his hand, the revelation of why he killed Aerys would have contributed to the evolution of him as a character.  It’s not just that our opinion of him changes, he himself changes.   Both of those transformations *just happen* to occur at the same time, but they build on each other, and are separate.  What I see in him is a transition from Utilitarianism to Kantianism.  I see a compelling, imperfect character transforming into the archetype of “The True Knight”.

**TL;DR – Jaime is such a compelling character not only because of Martin’s brilliant storytelling, but because his life represents the battle between competing ethical theories, Utilitarianism and Kantianism.**",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,empty,True,t3_1ij093,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1ij093/spoilers_all_jaime_lannister_and_the_philosophy/,

**III. Swords and Roses**

&gt;She dreamt she was at Harrenhal, down in the bear pit...This time it was Biter facing he...Naked he came, fondling his member, gnashing his filed teeth together. Brienne fled from him. “My sword,” she called. “Oathkeeper. Please.” The watchers did not answer. Renly was there, with Nimble Dick and Catelyn Stark. Shagwell, Pyg, and Timeon had come, and the corpses from the trees...Brienne wailed in horror at the sight of them, and Biter grabbed her arm and yanked her close and tore a chunk from her face. “Jaime,” she heard herself scream, “Jaime.” (AFFC 42/Brienne VIII)

&gt;...Then she was back at the Whispers...and facing Clarence Crabb...Crabb’s teeth had been filed into points. When Brienne went to draw her sword, she found her scabbard empty. “No,” she cried...It wasn’t fair. She could not fight without her magic sword. Ser Jaime had given it to her. The thought of failing him as she had failed Lord Renly made her want to weep. “My sword. Please, I have to find my sword.” (AFFC 42/Brienne VIII)

Brienne's fever dreams after her fight with Rorge and Biter signal how important redeeming Jaime's honor has become to her. But her dedication to this quest is not as straightforward as it appears. Nor is her anxiety about losing Oathkeeper. In the following passage, note how Brienne rejects roses (a symbol of romantic love) in favor of swords (a symbol of violence):

&gt;...“He will bring a rose for you,” her father promised her, but a rose was no good, a rose could not keep her safe. It was a sword she wanted. Oathkeeper. I have to find the girl. I have to find his honor. (AFFC 42/Brienne VIII)

Swords will keep Brienne safe, not roses, because roses represent the danger of humiliation:

&gt;Ser Ronnet was a landed knight, no more. For any such, the Maid of Tarth would have been a sweet plum indeed. “How is it that you did not wed?” Jaime asked him.

&gt;“Why, I went to Tarth and saw her...She was a sow in silk, though most sows have bigger teats. When she tried to talk she almost choked on her own tongue. I gave her a rose and told her it was all that she would ever have from me.” Connington glanced into the pit. “The bear was less hairy than that freak...” (AFFC 27/Jaime III)

Years later, Brienne still vividly remembers that encounter with Ronnet:

&gt;She remembered a day at Evenfall, and a young knight with a rose in his hand. He brought the rose to give to me. Or so her septa told her. All she had to do was welcome him to her father’s castle. He was eighteen, with long red hair that tumbled to his shoulders. She was twelve, tightly laced into a stiff new gown, its bodice bright with garnets. The two of them were of a height, but she could not look him in the eye, nor say the simple words her septa had taught her. Ser Ronnet. I welcome you to my lord father’s hall. It is good to look upon your face at last. (AFFC 9 /Brienne II)

Humiliation frightens Brienne more than injury or even death. What makes her well-equipped to face the latter (her size and strength) are precisely what make her vulnerable to the former:

&gt;Her father welcomed [Renly] with a feast and commanded her to attend; elsewise she would have hidden in her room like some wounded beast. She had been no older than Sansa, more afraid of sniggers than of swords. They will know about the rose, she told Lord Selwyn, they will laugh at me. But the Evenstar would not relent. (AFFC 4/Brienne I)

She relived the humiliating experience with Ser Ronnet in Renly's camp when his knights competed in a cruel competition to win her maidenhead. Sadly, her experiences with men have been so bad that she actually prefers they try to injure or kill her than woo her. She is much more confident facing men armed with swords rather than roses:

&gt;In the mêlée at Bitterbridge she had sought out her suitors and battered them one by one, Farrow and Ambrose and Bushy, Mark Mullendore and Raymond Nayland and Will the Stork. She had ridden over Harry Sawyer and broken Robin Potter’s helm...And when the last of them had fallen, the Mother had delivered Connington to her. This time Ser Ronnet held a sword and not a rose. Every blow she dealt him was sweeter than a kiss. (AFFC 20/Brienne IV)

One reason she beat Loras Tyrell in the mêlée was because of the device on his shield. It's also possible Brienne resented Loras, who was not only her opposite in every way, but closer to Renly than she could ever be:

&gt;Loras Tyrell had been the last to face her wroth that day. He’d never courted her...but he bore three golden roses on his shield that day, and Brienne hated roses. The sight of them had given her a furious strength... (AFFC Ch 20/Brienne IV).

For Brienne, roses are much more hateful and threatening than swords. Interestingly, GRRM uses swords and swordplay as a metaphor for sex in the Brienne/Jaime story arc. The Bloody Mummers took Renly's sword from Brienne, but Jaime gave her an even better one:

&gt;Renly’s sword. It still hurt, knowing she had lost it.

&gt;But she had another longsword hidden in her bedroll. She sat on the bed and took it out....When she slid Oathkeeper from the ornate scabbard, Brienne’s breath caught in her throat. (AFFC 4/Brienne I)

Many have described the adventures of Brienne and Jaime as a road trip/buddy movie. But [certain romantic comedy tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension) are also evident in their story. They are an odd couple who have been forced together by unusual circumstances. They constantly bicker, but the hostility is charged with sexual tension. For example, look at the swordfight between Brienne and Jaime that led to their capture by the Bloody Mummers. Notice how it's described in terms associated with romance, like kisses and dancing (also keep in mind what else Jaime's sword might represent):

&gt;“Give me the sword, Kingslayer.”

&gt;“Oh, I will.” He sprang to his feet and drove at her, the longsword alive in his hands. Brienne jumped back, parrying, but he followed, pressing the attack. No sooner did she turn one cut than the next was upon her. The swords kissed and sprang apart and kissed again. Jaime’s blood was singing...

&gt;The dance went on. He pinned her against an oak, cursed as she slipped away...Steel rang, steel sang, steel screamed and sparked and scraped, and the woman started grunting like a sow at every crash, yet somehow he could not reach her.

&gt;[Jaime]  laughed a ragged, breathless laugh. “Come on, come on, my sweetling, the music’s still playing. Might I have this dance, my lady?”

Jaime even symbolically takes Brienne's virginity during this 'dance':

&gt;...As he felt himself falling, he twisted the mischance into a diving lunge. His point scraped past her parry and bit into her upper thigh. A red flower blossomed, and Jaime had an instant to savor the sight of her blood before his knee slammed into a rock.

GRRM has used ""red flower"" to refer to menstruation (ACOK 57/Sansa V) so it's not a stretch to see the use of the term in this scene as a reference to maiden's blood. And in case you think I'm reaching here by interpreting the above scene as a symbolic deflowering:

&gt;Brienne lurched to her feet. She was all mud and blood below the waist, her clothing askew, her face red. She looks as if they caught us fucking instead of fighting...(ASOS 21/Jaime III)

What if Petyr Baelish is uninterested in ruling anyone, and Varys has misjudged him due to a deliberate ruse and an oversight?

**The ruse:**

Petyr never had a chance with Catelyn because he was of relatively low birth and physically unimposing stature. In public he acts like he doesn't care, but he absolutely despises the society which judges his virtues (cleverness, patience, practicality) as less worthy than bloodline or musculature. Petyr pretends he only cares about anything but himself and his own position, but look at what he actually did. As master of coin under Robert, he could steal as much tax revenue as he liked. We haven't even had a clue that anyone suspected this. As long as people see Petyr as a moneygrubbing upjumped mockingbird, he wasn't a threat to them. As long as his ""goals"" remain clear and well-understood by others, they can't even begin to oppose his actual plans. So why would anyone in his position deliberately destabilize the realm? Remember, Petyr successfully formented *a massive civil war*. 

**The Oversight:**

Petyr feigns indifference to Catelyn and to matters of rank, but only on the outside. Varys thinks Littlefinger is an agent of chaos, because Varys does not understand the love or loss that drives Petyr. The loss of the woman he loved has informed everything Petyr has done since. The men who wronged him (Hoster Tully and Brandon Stark) are dead, but he doesn't care. They weren't really responsible for their own actions anyway. They were just a product of their upbringings. Petyr is taking bitter revenge on *the entire fuedal system*.
 
Imagine that you are Petyr Baelish and your goals are these:

(1) Destroy the power of the nobility, so that rank and bloodline are meaningless.

(2) Degrade the system of knighthood, so that women do not consider men who excel at killing to be more worthy than those who don't.

(3) Gather personal wealth and influence.

If these are your goals, how would you have behaved differently than he has? 

Petyr Baelish doesn't want to be king of the ashes of Westero. Petyr wants to live in a Westeros where there is no king, nobility is meaningless, and warriors are seen as brutish tools rather than paragons of virtue. He wants to live in a Westeros where a girl from an old fancy family can fall for an intelligent, patient, diplomatic young man who has genuine feelings for her instead of some asshole with old blood who can swing a sword.

In light of my theory, read some of Tyrion's thoughts about Petyr from ACOK:

&gt;Ten years ago, Jon Arryn had given him minor sinecure in customs, where Lord Petyr had soon distinguished himself by bringing in three times as much as any of the king's other collectors. King Robert had been a prodigious spender. A man like Petyr Baelish who had a gift for rubbing two golden dragons together and breeding a third, was invaluable to his Hand. Littlefingers rise had been arrow swift. Within three years of coming to court he had been made master of coin and a member of the small council, and today the crown's revenues were ten times what they had under his predecessor...through the crown's debt had grown vast as we... A master juggler was Petyr Baelish.
 
&gt;Oh, he was clever. He did not simply collect the gold and lock in a treasure vault, no. He paid the king's debts in promises, and put the king's gold to work. He bought wagons, shops, ships, houses. He bought grain when it was plentiful and sold bread when it was scarce. He bought wool from the north and linen from the south and lace from Lys, stored it, moved it, dyed it, sold it. The golden dragons bred and multiplied, and Littlefinger lent them out and brought them home with hatchlings.
 
&gt;And in the process, he moved his own men into place. The Keepers of the Keys were his, all four. The King's Counter and the King of Scales were men he named. The officers in charge of all three mints. Harbormasters, tax farmers, custom sergeants, wool factors, toll collectors, pursers, wine factors; nine of every ten belonged to Littlefinger. They were men of middling birth, by and large, merchant's sons, lesser lordlings, sometimes even foreigners, but judging from the results, far more able than their highborn predecessors.
 
&gt;No one had ever thought to question the appointments, and why should they? Littlefinger was no threat to anyone. A clever, smiling, genial man, everyone's friend, always able to find whatever gold the king or his hand required, and yet of such undistinguished birth, one step from a hedge knight, he was not a man to fear.

I am merely restating information gathered from a variety of sources. If there are any arguments I've missed I'll add them here.

****

###THE THEORY

Aegon (Little Griff) is **not** actually the baby of Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell, but is a Blackfyre impostor that Varys and Illyrio Mopatis are propping up as a real Targaryen. He is descended from the female Blackfyre line (all the males were killed). An additional variation to the theory is that Aegon is the child of Illyrio and his late wife Serra, who may have been a Blackfyre. Some think Varys may also have Blackfyre blood in him.

****

###ARGUMENTS FOR  
.  
##MUMMER'S DRAGON VISION

One of Dany's visions in the House of the Undying:

&gt;. . . Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow. **A cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a cheering crowd.** From a smoking tower, a great stone beast took wing, breathing shadow fire. . . . *mother of dragons, slayer of lies* . . .

^ACOK ^48: ^DAENERYS ^IV

Dany later discusses the vision with Jorah:

&gt;“A dead man in the prow of a ship, a blue rose, a banquet of blood . . . what does any of it mean, *Khaleesi*? A mummer’s dragon, you said. What *is* a mummer’s dragon, pray?”  
“A cloth dragon on poles,” Dany explained. “Mummers use them in their follies, to give the heroes something to fight.”

^ACOK ^63: ^DAENERYS ^V

A ""mummer's dragon"" or fake dragon could be an metaphor for Aegon being a Blackfyre, and not a true dragon (i.e. Targaryen). The line ""slayer of lies"" may indicate that Aegon is one of the lies Dany may need to slay. Another way to interpret this is to say that Varys is the mummer and Aegon is the cloth dragon he is propping up. Varys is referred to as a mummer on several occasions.

##THE GOLDEN COMPANY

Illyrio and Tyrion discuss the [GC](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Golden_Company) breaking it's contract:

&gt;“I had heard the Golden Company was under contract with one of the Free Cities.”  
“Myr.” Illyrio smirked. “Contracts can be broken.”  
“There is more coin in cheese than I knew,” said Tyrion. “How did you accomplish that?”  
The magister waggled his fat fingers. “**Some contracts are writ in ink, and some in blood**. I say no more.”  
...  [Tyrion gives a history of the Golden Company and it's Blackfyre past]  ...  
“I admire your powers of persuasion,” Tyrion told Illyrio. “How did you convince the Golden Company to take up the cause of our sweet queen when they have spent so much of their history fighting against the Targaryens?”  
Illyrio brushed away the objection as if it were a fly. “Black or red, a dragon is still a dragon. When Maelys the Monstrous died upon the Stepstones, it was the end of the **male line** of House Blackfyre.” The cheesemonger smiled through his forked beard. “And Daenerys will give the exiles what Bittersteel and the Blackfyres never could. She will take them home.”

^ADWD ^5: ^TYRION ^II

This quote is the best evidence for the Blackfyre theory and offers a lot of insight. The GC was originally founded by [Bittersteel](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegor_Rivers) (Daemon Blackfyre's half-brother and closest ally), and their original mission was to seat a Blackfyre on the throne. Even after Daemon was killed in the first Blackfyre rebellion, Bittersteel tried several more times to seat one of Daemon's heirs on the throne until the last male heir died.

The GC has never broken a contract, but if it meant fulfilling their original mission statement this makes sense. While the broken Myr contract was written in ""ink"" the mission to restore a Blackfyre to the throne was written in ""blood"". This is also supported by the GC's motto: ""Beneath the gold, the bitter steel.""

Illyrio's justification for the GC breaking contract is that ""black or red, a dragon is still a dragon"". Meaning they don't care if it's a Targaryen or Blackfyre they're backing at this point so long as he leads them to Westeros. However, this seems to contradict a recollection Dany has:

&gt;Her brother Viserys had once feasted the captains of the Golden Company, in hopes they might take up his cause. *They ate his food and heard his pleas and laughed at him.*

^ADWD ^16: ^DAENERYS ^III

It would seem they turned down Viserys, a red dragon, so maybe they still do care. Miles 'Blackheart' Toyne (former GC captain) is the one who made the contract with Illyrio in secret, and given the Toynes' bloody feud with the Targaryens it wouldn't make sense for him to make that contract to back a Targ. [[read more about it here courtesy of feldman10](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/156odh/spoilers_all_complete_analysis_of_the_blackfyre/c7jvga9)]

##ILLYRIO &amp; SERRA

Another interesting tidbit from Illyrio in the above quote includes him specifically saying the **male** Blackfyre line was extinguished. This would seem to indicate a female line survived. That female could have been Illyrio's late wife Serra. Here is what he says of her:

&gt;Illyrio thrust his right hand up his left sleeve and drew out a silver locket. Inside was a painted likeness of a woman with **big blue eyes and pale golden hair streaked by silver**. “Serra. I found her in a Lysene pillow house and brought her home to warm my bed, but in the end I wed her. Me, whose first wife had been a cousin of the Prince of Pentos. The palace gates were closed to me thereafter, but I did not care. The price was small enough, for Serra.”  
...  
“Good fortune,” Illyrio called after them. “Tell the boy I am sorry that I will not be with him for his wedding. I will rejoin you in Westeros. That I swear, by my sweet Serra’s hands.”  

^ADWD ^5: ^TYRION ^II

We know from this that Serra has Valyrian features, blue eyes and silver-blonde hair. Although it should be noted that many people in Lys have Valyrian features as they were part of the Valyrian Freehold. Also, purple eyes are a *more* Targaryen feature than blue. From the last line we see that Illyrio has a very personal stake in Aegon's success and speaks very fondly of the boy. It's possible Aegon is Illyrio and Serra's son (with Serra being a Blackfyre). This would explain why Illyrio had a chest full of clothing meant for a small boy. It would also help explain why Illyrio is even interested in Westeros. He has all the money he could ever need and Tyrion even seems skeptical of Illyrio's motivations:

&gt;“Are you quite certain that Daenerys will make good her brother’s promises?”  
“She will, or she will not.” Illyrio bit the egg in half. “I told you, my little friend, not all that a man does is done for gain. Believe as you wish, but even fat old fools like me have friends, and debts of affection to repay.”  
*Liar, thought Tyrion. There is something in this venture worth more to you than coin or castles.* “You meet so few men who value friendship over gold these days.”

^ADWD ^5: ^TYRION ^II

So what is this ""debt of affection"" Illyrio looks to repay that is worth more than ""coins"" and ""castles""? He may be trying to fulfill Serra's wish for their son to take the Iron Throne on behalf of the Blackfyres. While this all fits, it is still largely circumstantial.

Another piece of evidence possibly indicating Illyrio is Aegon's father is a statue he has in his manse that looks a lot like Aegon (Illyrio later claims it's a young version of himself)[/u/jbtalley]

&gt;A naked boy stood on the water, poised to duel with a bravo’s blade in hand. He was lithe and handsome, no older than sixteen, with straight blond hair that brushed his shoulders. So lifelike did he seem that it took the dwarf a long moment to realize he was made of painted marble, though his sword shimmered like true steel.


^ADWD ^1: ^TYRION ^I


##SEPTON MERIBALD'S STORY

Septon Meribald tells Brienne and Pod the story of the Crossroads Inn:

&gt;""...He forged a new sign for the yard, a three-headed dragon of black iron that he hung from a wooden post. The beast was so big it had to be made in a dozen pieces, joined with rope and wire. When the wind blew it would clank and clatter, so the inn became known far and wide as the Clanking Dragon.”  
“Is the dragon sign still there?” asked Podrick.  
“No,” said Septon Meribald. “When the smith’s son was an old man, a bastard son of the fourth Aegon rose up in rebellion against his trueborn brother and took for his sigil a black dragon. These lands belonged to Lord Darry then, and his lordship was fiercely loyal to the king. The sight of the black iron dragon made him wroth, so he cut down the post, hacked the sign into pieces, and cast them into the river. One of the dragon’s heads washed up on the Quiet Isle many years later, though by that time it was red with rust...""

 ^AFFC ^37: ^BRIENNE ^VII

This story could be an allegory for Aegon being a Blackfyre. A black dragon is Blackfyre and a red dragon is a Targaryen. So the black dragons (Blackfyres) were forced across the Narrow Sea and many years later one of them (Aegon) rusted over and now appears to be a red dragon (Targ). 

##VARYS IS A BLACKFYRE

Varys being a Blackfyre is the most speculative part of the theory and need not be true for the other parts to be true. The evidence for it is entirely circumstantial, but it does explain some inconsistencies with Varys's character. Why despite claiming to be a Targaryen loyalist, he was feeding Aerys's paranoia about Rhaegar usurping the throne (according to accounts of Barristan and Jaime). Why he shaves his head, so that he can hide his Valyrian hair (although the same would be true if he were of any Valyrian descent, Blackfyre or otherwise). Also, why Varys was castrated as a boy. He tells Tyrion the following about his castration:

&gt;“One day at Myr, a certain man came to our folly. After the performance, he made an offer for me that my master found too tempting to refuse. I was in terror. I feared the man meant to use me as I had heard men used small boys, but in truth the only part of me he had need of was my manhood. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a long hooked blade, he sliced me root and stem, chanting all the while. I watched him burn my manly parts on a brazier. The flames turned blue, and I heard a voice answer his call, though I did not understand the words they spoke.""

^ACOK ^44: ^TYRION ^X

We know from Melisandre's practices that sorcerers prefer to use royal blood in their rituals. If Varys was a Blackfyre he would have royal blood.

##DUNK &amp; EGG

A large portion of the Dunk &amp; Egg novellas covers the history of the Blackfyre Rebellions. This could be hinting at a greater significance for the Blackfyres in the ASOAIF series as a whole. Of course it could also just be window dressing for the novellas and have no other significance.

##AEGON BEING SAVED DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

How could Varys have known Gregor would smash baby Aegon's face beyond recognition? It's unlikely this could have been planned. [/u/jbtalley]

##AGE DISCREPANCY

Aegon was born in 282AL, so by the time Tyrion meets him he should be around 18 years old. Yet here is Tyrion's description of Little Griff [/u/jbtalley]:

&gt;He was a lithe and well-made youth, with a lanky build and a shock of dark blue hair. The dwarf put his age at **fifteen, sixteen**, or near enough to make no matter.

^ADWD ^8: ^TYRION ^III

Of course it's very plausible that an 18 year old could be mistaken for 16, so I wouldn't call this strong evidence.

##ADWD EARLY DRAFT

[/u/feldman10]  
Earlier drafts of ADWD chapters have other clues. It is speculated that Martin cut a lot this material because it made Aegon's parentage too obvious.

[From a 2005 reading of Tyrion II](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/54-pre-adwd-spoilers-tyrion-2-spoilers-for-adwd/): 
&gt;**""Illyrio says he wants to give Young Griff his blessings and has a gift for him in the chests**. Haldon tells him there is no time for the litter. **Illyrio gets angry and says there are things Griff must know.**  
...  
Haldon eyes Tyrion and then begins to speak in another language. Tyrion cannot tell what it is but think it might be Volantene. He catches a few words that come close to High Valyrian. The words he catches are, queen, dragon, and **sword.""**

It has been speculated that Illyrio was going to give Young Griff ""Blackfyre,"" the ancestral sword of House Targaryen that was taken overseas by the Blackfyres.

[From Elio](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/57038-are-there-any-blackfyre-heirs-left/page__st__60#entry2693597), who fact-checked earlier drafts of ADWD:
&gt;""An earlier draft of the ""lesson"" chapter had quite a bit more detail about Maelys the Monstrous and the Blackfyres (for those who have GoO's RPG, some of that information ended up in that book). I wonder why George decided to pull it from this book.""

****

###ARGUMENTS AGAINST  
.  
##NO PROOF!

One big argument against this whole theory is that all of the evidence is basically circumstantial. That is not to say circumstantial evidence is invalid (especially in a book), but just that there is no smoking gun yet. 

##VARYS'S TALK WITH KEVAN

This is what Varys tells a dying Kevan Lannister:

&gt;“Aegon?” For a moment he did not understand. Then he remembered. A babe swaddled in a crimson cloak, the cloth stained with his blood and brains. “Dead. He’s dead.”  
“No.” The eunuch’s voice seemed deeper. “He is here. Aegon has been shaped for rule since before he could walk. He has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be, but that was not the end of his education. He reads and writes, he speaks several tongues, he has studied history and law and poetry. A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith since he was old enough to understand them. He has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need. He can fish and cook and bind up a wound, he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be hunted, to be afraid. Tommen has been taught that kingship is his right. Aegon knows that kingship is his duty, that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them.”

^ADWD ^72: ^EPILOGUE

Varys directly answers Kevan's question about Aegon being dead and says he isn't. Why would Varys lie about Aegon to Kevan, who he was about to kill anyways? It is unlikely that if Aegon is a Blackfyre that Varys wouldn't know, because he was likely the one who smuggled baby Aegon out of King's Landing (or didn't), so he likely knows if Aegon is really Aegon. So why lie to a dying man about it? Some possible answers are:

* Varys ""little birds"" were present when Kevan was dying, perhaps Varys meant to keep the truth about Aegon from them. [/u/ChurchHatesTucker]
* Varys perhaps didn't lie. All he said is that ""Aegon"" isn't dead, but never said *which* Aegon he was referring to. [/u/jbtalley]
* Varys doesn't know Aegon is a Blackfyre. Illyrio is the only one who knows and is playing him.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1356114870.0,,EuronCrowsEye,True,t3_156odh,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/156odh/spoilers_all_complete_analysis_of_the_blackfyre/,

**Eddard + Ashara = Jon**  

A friend of mine who reads books *a lot* recently finished completely reading through the entire book series twice, completely spoiler free. He absolutely forbade any of his other friends to tell him even the slightest fact or theory from any point of the books. I think that itself is pretty miraculous.  

When he finally finished a bunch of us were talking about what various theories he has and one thing he said was: ""I reckon that Young Griff is the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna"". At no point did he mention Jon or anyone else as the 'Tower of Joy baby'.  

We told him about the R+L=J theory and he thought about it for a bit, while we were still talking, and then tried to give his reasons why R+L=J is wrong and why R+L=A is right.  

This is what I can remember:  

* Tyrion notes Young Griff to be ~2 years younger than Aegon-Original should be.   
* If Jon Connington is handed a new born babe at a time when Aegon-Original would be about 2 years old, he'd know that it's an imposter. We get the impression from his POV chapters that Young Griff is legitimately Rhaegar's son.   
* If R+L=J, then that means Varys and Illyrio must have come up with a grand, **GRAND** scheme to replace Aegon-Original before the sack of KL, whisk him off to the Free Cities, but not Rhaenys for some reason, and then hope that the Mountain smashes the face of Not-Aegon into unrecognisable smithereens **-or-** Aegon-Original isn't replaced before the sack of KL and did actually die but then Varys and Illyrio pretend that they did whisk him off and hand over a replacement baby to Jon Connington that would still not fit the age gap he should be and would question the legitimacy of claiming the baby is Rhaegar's
* Eddard would have risked taking a babe back to Winterfell that would have grown up with Targeryen features that would have been extremely obvious to any onlookers.  
* It gives Eddard a flaw, a weakness. It makes for a good character if he did actually dishonour his marriage for a woman he truly loved  
* It fits the story better, thematically. If R+L=J, then what? He'll be the one to save the Kingdom and also end up as King? Think of all the instances GRRM has specifically set out to **avoid** cliches like that  
* It's easier to explain in the last 2 books. Who can confirm R+L=J now? Howland Reed. Who can confirm R+L=A? Howland Reed still, plus perhaps Varys, Illyrio, Ashara and Jon Connington. Is GRRM basically going to have Howland Reed turn up as some kind of *deus ex machina* to say ""Oh by the way guys, Jon Snow is really the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna and should thus be King. I know there's no other evidence but you can trust me""  
* It still fits Young Griff being the Mummer's Dragon in the HOTU vision. He claims to be THE Aegon. He is still an Aegon, and is still the son of Rhaegar.  
* Varys still does not lie about Aegon's return. The only difference being that Kevan assumes a different Aegon  

* **Edit** Ned told Jon they'd talk about his mother. Would Ned have seen him again and been all like ""Psyche! I'm not really going to tell you"". He could have told him it was Ashara Dayne, and it would have been fine.


Sorry for the absolutely messy way I've presented this but I'm doing this mostly from memory of a long conversation a couple days ago.  

I'd love for people to reply about why this theory is ridiculous and break down the reasons why, because for my mind now, the story would be a mile better if the Tower of Joy baby is Aegon, rather than Jon, in almost every circumstance.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1369937138.0,,EuronCrowsEye,True,t3_1fcibo,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fcibo/spoilers_all_rla_eaj/,

I looked his up, and got excited and almost posted a response about it until I realized that thread was only spoilery up to SoS.  So I thought I'd start a new one.

Both Robb and Jon say the names of their wolves before (ostensibly, in Jon's case) kicking the bucket.

Robb:
&gt;Robb grabbed the edge of the table and forced himself to stand. “Mother,” he said, “Grey Wind . . .” 

Martin, George R.R. (2003-03-04). A Storm of Swords: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Three (p. 703). Random House, Inc.. Kindle Edition. 

Jon:
&gt;Jon fell to his knees. He found the dagger’s hilt and wrenched it free. In the cold night air the wound was smoking. “Ghost,” he whispered. 

Martin, George R.R. (2011-07-12). A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five (p. 913). Random House, Inc.. Kindle Edition. 

In Jon's case, he's been clearly established as warg, but it occurs to me that this is a pretty good hint from GRRM that Robb was too.  (Which is in keeping with the popular theory that all the Stark kids have latent warg-y tendencies.)

The only other example in the texts where the reader gets to actually witness a warg's death is the prologue to DwD, when Varymyr dies and gets all up inside of his human companion, Thistle.  You have to read a few pages back from his actual death, but it turns out that the last word he speaks out loud is, in fact ""Thistle.""

&gt;""Thistle,"" Varamyr called feebly, wondering how far she could have gone.

Martin, George R.R. (2011-07-12). A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five (p. 9). Random House, Inc.. Kindle Edition. 

So I'm thinking this is probably deliberate on GRRM's part.  Moreover, given that the whole point of the DwD prologue seems to be to illustrate the phenomenon of a warg surviving the death of their original body through inhabiting a different body, I'm thinking Robb's and Jon's last words aren't just an indication of where there thoughts are, but where their soul/spirit/essence/whatever is literally heading.  

In Robb's case, that didn't do him much good, since the sonsofbitches got Greywind too. But in Jon's case, ghost is safely locked up inside his quarters.  Should Jon's body actually be dead by the end of that chapter, dude is definitely still chillin inside Ghost's wolfy noggin.

It's a long shot, I know, but as the great Michael Scott once said, ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."".

I've decided that I will not stand idly by while the others and the wildlings and gods know what else gather their forces against me. I intend to pursue this job with all the power and might of the Night's Watch. That's where you lords and ladies come in.

Upvote this post. Tweet it. Re-tweet it. Facebook it. /r/Bestof it. Repost the hell out of it. In so doing you will make it known and eventually *it will be known* to the powers-that-be. Hell, even [fill out the application](https://reddit.wufoo.com/forms/community-manager-application/) yourself and make the answers to all of the questions, ""jmk4422 should have this job... it is known"".

The night is dark and full of terrors, my friends. Help me in this endeavor and I will forever be in your debt. And a jmk4422 always pays his debts.

P.S. Or you can just give me some advice in the comments section. Either way, thanks for the help!

1358531131.0,461,self.asoiaf,16trz3,"(Spoilers All) Lightbringer is not a Sword, but a Child",HowlandRead,585,124,169,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/16trz3/spoilers_all_lightbringer_is_not_a_sword_but_a/,"First off, I apologize in advance if this has been posted before. I tried doing a search and didn't see anything else like this although I find it hard to believe something similar hasn't been posted before. Either way, this is a theory I came up with concerning Rhaegar, Lyanna, Jon Snow, and Lyanna's death.


Lightbringer is not a sword, but a child. That child is Jon Snow.


This assumes that R+L=J and that Lyanna died giving birth to Jon Snow. Rhaegar's wife Elia Martell was also said to be pretty sickly. In Jon Connington's chapter ""The Griffin Reborn"", Connington states that Elia was bed ridden for half a year after giving birth to Rhaenys and nearly died giving birth to Aegon. After Aegon, the Maesters told Rhaegar that Elia would die if she had any more children.


Rhaegar, believing that the dragon has three heads, thought that he needed to have a third child. We know this from Daenerys visit to the House of the Undying and her vision of Rhaegar (see below). Once the Maesters told Rhaegar that Elia could not have another, Rhaegar started to look around for other potential mothers. Enter Lyanna with all her love and beauty. 


Rhaegar had a third child with Lyanna, Jon Snow, the most important of the three heads (children) of the dragon (Rhaegar). 


Jon Snow was the third (important) and the only one who killed his mother (more important). There is another prophecy that involves a forging that took three attempts, with the third one resulting in a death. Consider that Rhaegar Targeryen was Azor Ahai reborn, not Jon Snow. Perhaps Lightbringer isn't a physical sword at all, but instead a child. When forging Lightbringer it took Azor Ahai three tries before he finally got it right and then sacrificed his wife Nissa Nissa on the third and final forge.


In attempting to fulfill one prophecy, Rhaegar actually fulfilled another (or both) prophecy, but Rhaegar never realized with his third child he was bringing Lightbringer into the world and at the same time killing Lyanna (or whoever the mother would have been).


Metaphorically, just the existence of Jon Snow will ""bring"" the ""light"" (Daenerys and her dragons) back to Westeros with all of the events that his birth has caused (again assuming R+L=J):


* R+L=J
* Robert Baratheon starts a war causing all Targs to be killed or hidden
* Daenerys and Viserys are brought to Essos to hide them
* The Targs want their throne back because it was stolen from them
* Throughout Viserys plans, Dany gets her dragon eggs and hatches them
* Viserys dies, but Dany still wants to take back their kingdom
* Dany will come back to Westeros now with dragons


Indirectly, Jon is bringing the light back to Westeros.


Thoughts?


**Daenerys' Vision of Rhaegar**


Viserys, was her first thought the next time she paused, but a second glance told her otherwise. The man had her brother’s hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a dark indigo rather than lilac. ""Aegon,"" he said to a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed. ""What better name for a king?""


""Will you make a song for him?"" the woman asked.


""He has a song,"" the man replied. ""He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire."" He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany’s, and it seemed as if he saw her standing there beyond the door. ""There must be one more,"" he said, though whether he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed she could not say.

1370848142.0,456,self.asoiaf,1g16h6,(Spoilers ASOS/S03E10) Is the show trying to take Stannis in another direction?,Meoang,524,68,407,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1g16h6/spoilers_asoss03e10_is_the_show_trying_to_take/,"I've noticed in the comments on /r/gameofthrones this season that when book-readers make posts on how they support Stannis, show-watchers often reply that Stannis seems like an incompetent jerk who isn't accomplishing anything and that he only does whatever Melisandre says.  Having read the books, I usually respond to them saying something like ""you'll kind of just have to wait and see why we like him so much."" I'm starting to suspect, though, that this moment is either never going to come, or it's going to come in a different way.

I didn't really expect the scene with Stannis, Davos, and Melisandre talking about Gendry/Edric and going north this season because it happens so late in the books.  To me, that scene was either supposed to be THE moment that show-watchers realize why many book-readers love Stannis so much, or it was supposed to have been a cliff-hanger that would lead to that revelation next season.  Instead, we get neither, and the scene is subtly changed so that it takes an entirely different direction.

In the books, Davos reminds Stannis of his duty to the realm:

&gt;""I know that a king protects his people, or he is no king at all.""

With Stannis reflecting on it later:

&gt;""Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth, but he reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my rights. I had the cart before the horse, Davos said. I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne."" Stannis pointed north. ""There is where I'll find the enemy I was born to fight.""

But in the show, we get Stannis sentencing Davos to death, and only changing his mind because Melisandre tells him to.  Instead of getting the king who cared, we get someone who comes off like he doesn't actually know what he's doing and in the end only does whatever Melisandre wants him to do.

Don't get me wrong, Stannis will still most likely respond to the threat in the north the same way as he does in the books, but his motivations have been completely changed.  Show-Stannis always acted a little strangely and distinctly different from the book version, but after this it feels like D&amp;D are rewriting Stannis to be completely different because of how they felt about him.  For example: [David Benioff on Stannis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=DaslqlBtSbc), [Dan Weiss on Stannis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWQMqaFm5X0&amp;list=PL468A4537ECDC5466&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=259s).",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1370851846.0,,StannisOfDragonstone,True,t3_1g16h6,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1g16h6/spoilers_asoss03e10_is_the_show_trying_to_take/,

I speculate that Varys is the grandson of Aerion ""Brightflame"" Targaryen. This started when I saw that Varys said he'd been born in Lys. Assuming this is true, here is my proposed timeline with dates taken from the ASOIAF wiki.:


**208 AL** - Aerion Targaryen is exiled to Lys where he fathered at least one child.

**232 AL** - Aerion drank wildfire and died. 

**233 AL** - King Maekar I died. A Great Council was called to determine succession. The two oldest sons, including Aerion, were already dead. The council noted that Aerion left behind ""*an infant son*"" but they pass on the idea of offering the crown to this foreign-born, bastard infant. Instead they offered the crown to Maester Aemon, who famously refused it, and the crown went to King Aegon V.

**243 AL** - ""Mad"" King Aerys was born.

**248 AL** - Aerion's bastard son would have been 16. This seems to be a normal age to father your first child in Westeros/Esso. I propose he fathered at least Varys.

**259 AL** - Prince Rhaegar is born.

**276 AL** - King Aerys summoned Varys to court to become his spymaster. If he was born in the range between Aerys and Rhaegar, Varys would have been in his mid-20s.

**282-283 AL** - Robert's Rebellion. Most known Targaryens die.

**300 AL** -  The events of *A Dance With Dragons*, which would put Varys in his early 50s. 


**Supplemental:**

Varys says that he was born a slave in Lys. He shaves his head, perhaps to hide a distinctive hair color; there are stories of his great-uncle Aegon doing the same. Also, Aerion once physically threatened to castrate his brother Aegon; it would be ironic if Aerion's grandson suffered just this fate. On that note: Varys' castration was a blood magic ritual, similar to what Melisandre's been trying to do with ""king's blood."" This might also hint at his royal lineage. Perhaps it wasn't for magic at all; perhaps castration was simply to put an end to yet another ""splinter"" Targaryen dynasty. I also think that ""Varys"" sounds like a bastardization (no pun intended) of a typical Targaryen name ending in -eris or -erys.

This would explain a lot of his Targaryen loyalist tendencies. But the question of his complicity in sending assassins after Dany in GOT is an unanswered one. 

*If you want to upgrade to ""Tinfoil"":* Note that Illyrio's beloved wife Serra was also from Lys.

He was stabbed four (or three) times, but that’s not necessarily deadly, especially considering other apparent POV deaths (Bran and Arya come immediately to mind). I had Jon’s “death” spoiled for me, so this might have colored my interpretation of how his chapter ended. But I think the last sentence signals **Jon’s assassination attempt being interrupted by White Walkers.** Let’s look at the scant evidence. First, the final line in the chapter:

&gt; He didn't feel the fourth dagger, only the cold.

Obviously, most people read this to suggest that “the cold” is death. But death by stabbing is a slow death usually brought about by blood loss. It’s unlikely that Job would die after several seconds of stabbing. So if “the cold” isn’t his death, how could there be a cold so severe that it overwhelms the pain of being stabbed? Well, Sam Tarley has read conflicting reports that Others come when it is cold or that it becomes cold when they appear. What if the second interpretation is true and it becomes cold when Others appear? In Jon’s second to last chapter, Tormund Giantsbane describes the Others:

&gt; A man can fight the dead, but when their masters come, when the white mists rise up … how do you fights a mist crow? Shadows with teeth … **air so cold it hurts to breath, like a knife inside your chest** … you do not know, you cannot know … can your sword cut cold?

Emphasis mine. The White Walkers bring a cold that is just as bad, if not worse than, a knife inside your chest. And this comparison of a walker’s cold with a dagger in the chest comes in the last chapter before Jon’s assassination attempt. There’s obviously not much textual support for this theory, but I find it just as plausible as Jon dying, warging, being resurrected, becoming a Coldhands-esque creature, or whatever combination of those is the most popular theory.

Justice. *Fire and Blood.*' are the best. But I was rereading Dance and I came across this quote by Big Bucket Wull in one of Asha's chapters:

&gt; Winter is almost upon us, boy. And winter is death. I would sooner my men die fighting for the Ned’s little girl than alone and hungry in the snow, weeping tears that freeze upon their cheeks. No one sings songs of men who die like that. As for me, I am old. This will be my last winter. Let me bathe in Bolton blood before I die. I want to feel it spatter across my face when my axe bites deep into a Bolton skull. I want to lick it off my lips and die with the taste of it on my tongue.


Is that not a kickass quote? And plus, this, to me, just reinforces some parts of the Northern Conspiracy. The north was so intensely loyal to the Starks, and the Boltons at best don't cut it, and at worst are actively terrible. 

Wull is bloodthirsty towards the Boltons, in a somehow pragmatic and not at all insane way. Some bloodthirstiness in the books, such as that which the Mountains of the Moon clans display, shows that the men displaying it are savage. But Wull doesn't seem that way. He's righteously enraged.

No, they're not fantasy, they're science fiction.  And yet when I was reading them I felt very much like I was reading ASoIaF.  Why?

_____________


**#1)** The stories take place in believable universes, each with fascinating cultures and histories.  You really feel like you're exploring new worlds, just as you do with ASoIaF.

**#2)** If you like the battles of wits in ASoIaF (particularly employed by characters such as Varys, Littlefinger, Tyrion, Tywin, etc), you will absolutely love the Foundation series.  Every chapter and story in the series centers around intelligent schemers trying to out-scheme each other.

**#3)** The story is chocked full of mysteries and surprising twists, and each one is answered in a mind blowing way.

**#4)** Just as ASoIaF defies fantasy tropes, Asimov defies what we consider to be the Science Fiction tropes.  The world may be set up to 25,000 years in the future, but the characters, social structures, politics, and even technologies feel extremely realistic and relevant.  There are no aliens; nothing silly along those lines.  Asimov was also a biochemist, which shows in his work — a lot of the fantastical elements in the story are actually grounded in real science.
______________________
There are seven books in the Series (although technically all of Asimov's works take place in the same universe), including two prequels.  I would leave the prequels for last, and read in the following order:

• Foundation

• Foundation and Empire

• Second Foundation

• Foundation's Edge

• Foundation and Earth

• Prelude to Foundation

• Forward the Foundation

This was about the battle.  One highlight was the description of the pit fighters coming out to fight, in ridiculous armor, totally unprepared for real battle.  (One of them, a woman, was nearly naked, dressed in a snake.)  It also described the herons (the Yunkish slaves on stilts) fighting and not doing very well.  Then suddenly lots of ships arrived.  Someone noticed there were ""squids"" on the ships.  Barristan recognized that that meant Ironmen.  Someone saw that they were fighting against the Yunkai.  Barristan didn't know which Ironmen were on the ships and he first thought Balon, then remembered that he heard he died, and wondered if it could have something to do with his son who was living with the Starks.

Right after the reading, GRRM confirmed that it was, not surprisingly, Victarion and his men on the ships.  

Okay, other tidbits from the Q&amp;A that you guys might find interesting:

* He said he didn't follow the war of the roses too closely in the books and just took some ideas from it as well as from lots of other things.  He said there was no 1 to 1 correspondence between anything in the book and any other story or event.  

* The explanation for the seasons is purely magical.

* Someone asked about if he feels guilty killing characters.  He said yes.  He said the Red Wedding was the hardest thing he has written.  Then he said ""I don't kill the characters; it's the other characters who kill the characters.""   He talked about how death was a natural part of life and how he wants his stories to be realistic, so sometimes he has to kill people.
Also: ""When a character dies, you [the reader] should feel it."" 

* He was asked about how some chapters had titles instead of names.  He said something along the lines of ""There's a method behind my madness, but I'll leave it to you guys to figure out.""  He said that when an unnamed character becomes named, it means something.  Are there any theories about this?

* On Natalia Tena's audition for Osha: ""fucking mesmerizing... even with her clothes on""

**Edit:** I forgot to mention, he pronounces Dothraki like Doth-rack-eye.  I was really surprised.

**Edit 2:** Someone else took *way* better notes than me.  [Much better description of the chapters](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/81338-twow-spoilers-barristan/#entry4122024)

1339658817.0,441,self.asoiaf,v1c92,Hodor's purpose? [Major Spoilers ADWD/speculation],heimdall237,526,85,202,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/v1c92/hodors_purpose_major_spoilers_adwdspeculation/,"I've always loved mythology, and when I was younger I read a lot of Norse myths. The funny thing is that I never noticed until today that Hodor sounds awfully similar to one of the [Norse gods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6%C3%B0r), and so it got me thinking. 

WARNING: viking story

In Norse mythology, Hodur is one of Odin's (think Zeus) sons. Compared to the other gods, he is an unimpressive specimen, especially compared to his brother Baldr. In fact, Hodur is blind. He isn't very important in the pantheon, and he rarely appears in the stories. *Until he helps trigger the end of the world.*

The way the story goes is that Odin and his wife were really paranoid about Baldr dying, since it was prophesized to be one of the signs of Ragnarok, the end of the world. (Yes, Norse gods can die. Just stay with me for a bit.) So they went around to all the living things and made them promise to never harm Baldr. They made everything promise, with the exception of mistletoe, since it was so young. 

Remember, the Norse gods are viking gods, so they throw mad parties. From the looks of things, everyone got roaring drunk and started throwing things at Baldr because nothing could harm him. However, Loki, the god of mischief, found out that mistletoe never promised, so he made a spear/arrow of mistletoe and sauntered on over to Hodur, who was standing away from everyone else since he's kind of a loner. 

Loki asks Hodur why he isn't having fun with everyone else by chucking stuff at Baldr, and Hoder points out that he is blind. So Loki says he'll help Hodur out by giving Hodur the mistletoe and helping him throw it. Hodur, with the help of Loki, throws the mistletoe, and it kills Baldr. Shit goes down, there is a wild manhunt for Loki, and then one of Odin's sons goes ahead and kills Hodur to take revenge for Baldr (a dick move since Hodur is blind and Loki manipulated him). These events  lead to Ragnarok, the end of the world, and an [awesome battle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k). 

Okay, so how does this relate to ASOIAF? Besides the name, Hodur and Hodor seem to have a few other things in common. They're both swell guys who are looked down on by everyone else and usually treated badly (like when the Ironborn beat Hodor). Both of them are extremely strong (I'm kind of spitballing for Hodur, though he was a viking so he was probably jacked), but suffer from some kind of limitation. Then, and this is the big one, **they are unable to hurt other living things unless someone manipulates them.**

Bran is warging into Hodor on a pretty regular basis now, and they make a pretty good team, but I'm kind of disturbed with how easily Bran treats Hodor like Summer or some other animal. I'm not saying Bran is evil, but I do find it eerie and similar to Loki using Hodur. So, if GRRM got some of his inspiration from Norse myths, I'm thinking that someone (Bran, Bloodraven, or a third party) will use Hodor for something dark. And Hodor will die. Though let's be honest, GRRM doesn't have any qualms with killing fan favorites.

The thing is though that Hodor has done nothing bad to anyone. He doesn't deserve to die. I'm kind of thinking of when Catelyn killed Jinglebells. Hodor is one of the sweetest, simplest characters in the book, and his death would be shocking. Hodur died for something he wasn't responsible for, and I think Hodor will have the same fate. 

Though of course, what will kill Hodor? What do you guys think?

Edit: You guys have been great. We've had some good discussions, so thanks a lot, and now I'm starting to see some more parallels to Norse mythology in ASOIAF. Also, if any of you guys are interested in reading more about Norse myths, Acrossbee gave an entertaining link below to MythsRetold.

I've copy pasted the explanation countless times and have never noticed the bold part because I take R+L=J for granted.

&gt;**Since all of their mothers died**, who gave Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister their names?

&gt;Mothers can name a child before birth, or during, or after, even while they are dying. Dany was most like named by her mother, Tyrion by his father, Jon by Ned.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the in-story rumors of who Jon's mom is never include that she's dead, right? As far as everyone knows Wylla is still at Starfall and the fisherman's daughter is still off on a boat somewhere. 

The only rumored mom who's dead at this point is Ashara Dayne who supposedly committed suicide after giving birth to a stillborn daughter according to Barristan Selmy in ADWD. And if the baby was stillborn and was a girl, it couldn't have grown up to be Jon.

So it's not pointing directly to R+L=J but it does seem to discredit all the rumored moms in the story.

I'm a female fan of ASoIaF and fantasy literature in general. I'm pretty familiar with how badly female characters can be treated in the genre (it's sadly prevalent, but getting better over time...slooowly). However, I keep seeing the accusation of 'misogynist!' flung at ASoIaF, especially since the show got so popular. [Here's](http://meadowparty.com/blog/2013/06/05/a-game-of-thrones/) an excellent example of what I mean (and boy howdy does that piece make me froth at the mouth, talk about missing a point).

This is super frustrating for me, since there ARE tons of books that don't handle female characters well to the point of being straight-up misogynist and I really don't feel that Martin's one of those authors, at all.

Over here is where I talk about what the difference is between something being misogynist and something containing misogyny and how I feel Martin deconstructs crappy sexist fantasy tropes:

1362151488.0,430,self.asoiaf,19grs4,(Spoilers all) Leaked and rumored changes for Season 3,feldman10,520,90,469,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/19grs4/spoilers_all_leaked_and_rumored_changes_for/,"Last year I wrote [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/otonb/rumored_changes_for_season_2_spoilers_all_books/) compiling the leaked and rumored changes from the books for Season 2. So here's what I've seen on various sites about Season 3 changes. Last year's thread was pretty accurate, so if you don't want possible changes to be spoiled for you, don't read on.

Overall it appears that this season will stick much more closely to the books than S2 did. There will be many changes, but they'll mostly involve simplifying complex situations and substituting more prominent characters for less prominent ones while retaining the core of every book plotline. 

* **King's Landing**: The biggest changes of the year will be in King's Landing. Since Joff's wedding will be in Season 4, the importance of the Lannister/Tyrell maneuvering over who Sansa will marry will be greatly elevated and expanded. It will climax with the Sansa/Tyrion marriage in Episode 8. While this is not confirmed, it seems very likely that the Queen of Thorns will try to marry Sansa and Loras (to his chagrin), rather than Sansa and Willas. We also know there will be many invented scenes so the various Tyrell characters can share scenes with the various Lannisters and Sansa. Also, there will be a subplot with Ros (big surprise). Speculation has Ros as, in some way, a substitution for Dontos, who has been cut from the season.

* **Stannis**: The most controversial change of the year by far will likely be to Stannis. There's no word of Edric Storm being cast, but the showrunners have said that one plotline this season will be about ""a debated sacrifice."" So it seems clear that Stannis will seriously contemplate giving *Shireen* to the flames. 

* **Jon**: The recognizable actor Mackenzie Crook was cast as Orell. It seems likely that Orell will be a composite of the eagle-skinchanger Jon kills in ACOK and Varamyr (one eagle is cheaper than 6 wild beasts). The battles at the Wall and Ygritte's death are almost certainly not going to happen this season. We can assume this because the actor who plays Pyp revealed that he did only one day of filming this season. Pyp remained at the Wall and is not in Mormont's party, so it seems likely that Jon will return to the Wall in the season finale and be briefly welcomed by Pyp, with the battles taking place next season.

* **Dany**: Many think that Dany will free the Unsullied at the end of the season. In fact, leaked audition videos long ago revealed that this occurs midway through. (The videos showed a scene where Daario and Mero discuss what to do about Dany and her Unsullied army.)  The new list of episode titles strongly suggests that the season will end with Dany's victory over Yunkai'i.

* **Theon**: A leaked audition video sheds some light on Theon's (invented) scenes too. Apparently Theon wakes up and is led to believe that he is being held by the *ironborn*, and he's told that his father has locked him up because he's such a disappointment. There are some mindfuck / torture scenes with the character called ""Boy"". Probably only later in the season will it be revealed that ""Boy"" is Ramsay, to disguise the Bolton betrayal.

* **Robb**: A tweet from Oona Chaplin led many to believe that Talisa will attend the Red Wedding, and probably die there.

* **Jaime**: The Vargo Hoat role is being taken by a character named Locke, who is simply a Bolton man rather than the foreign sellsword of shifting allegiances from the book.

* **Littlefinger**: There will be invented scenes in the Eyrie with Lysa and Sweetrobin in at least one episode this year. I suspect this is Littlefinger visiting to propose marriage, but this has not been confirmed.

A big chunk of Season 4 (and perhaps even 5) for these characters could be Ramsay hunting Rickon through the north, with Reek in tow- and Reek could even find some very small and subtle ways to sabotage the hunt, and gain just a smidgen of redemption.  And it wouldn't be hard for the writers to find a way for Rickon's path to change from Last Hearth to Skagos.

*[In Defense of Hardhome](http://zincpiccalilli.livejournal.com/11089.html)* (2 Parts)

&gt; Since the release of ADWD, opinions on Jon Snow's tenure as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch have become rather polarized, with some arguing that he's a visionary leader beyond any other in ASOIAF thus far, a great king in the making, and others that he's an oathbreaker whose final act of desertion received just punishment from his men. I admit I'm more partial to the first view and, in this multipart essay, hope to present a convincing defense of Jon Snow as acting within the limits of his elected office.

Sansa gets blamed for what happened to Lady and for telling Cersei Ned's plans, but she was extremely young at the time, and Ned himself should bare a heaping of blame for *telling Cersei his own plans.* 

And there's one thing Ned should have done, but didn't: he should have given Sansa the same lecture he gave Arya. Arya had a MASSIVE advantage over Sansa in that she got a talking to from Ned about how not to trust anyone, and he provided her with an instructor who taught her even more life lessons. Sansa got none of that. She got NOTHING. Arya started the game six steps ahead of Sansa, and she barely made it out of KL as it is. If it weren't for Syrio, she would have been captured, and because she ISN'T as good at playing the political game as Sansa...she would probably have been maimed or killed by Joffrey for refusing to submit, or for humiliating him during AGOT (which, interestingly enough, was stupid of her and smart of Sansa. Arya did the RIGHT thing, but Sansa did the SMART thing. Would Cersei really have let it slide if Sansa said Joffrey was the instigator?)

But that's all a matter of opinion. What bothers me the most about how people talk about is Sansa is how they overlook the content of her chapters post-AGOT. People always say she is ""naive"" and ""shows no agency"", but this seems to be code for ""I find her chapters boring."" Most people seem to think she was naive up until her chapters became more interesting to them, but that's not true at all. There are more passages than these that show how she is not naive at all post-AGOT, but these two are my favorite. The first from ACOK:

&gt;Sansa watched him walk off, his body swaying heavily from side to side with every step, like something from a grotesquerie. He speaks more gently than Joffrey, she thought, but t he queen spoke to me gently too. He ’s still a Lannister, her brother and Joff ’s uncle, and no friend. Once she had loved Prince Joffrey with all her heart, and admired and trusted his mother, the queen. They had repaid that love and trust with her father’s head. Sansa would never make that mistake again.

The second from ASOS:

&gt;They are children, Sansa thought. They are silly little girls, even Elinor. They’ ve never seen a battle, they’ve never seen a man die, they know nothing. Their dreams were full of songs and stories, the way hers had been before Joffrey cut her father's head off. Sansa pitied them. Sansa envied them.

If you really focus on Sansa's chapters, a very clear image of her arises that is nothing like the one the fanbase ascribes to her. She still dreams of a knight in shining armor come to rescue her, but she knows that will not happen. I'm sure every prisoner everywhere dreams of a chance to escape, but they know it probably will not happen, so the dreams themselves become the only means of escape. We also see multiple instances of her stepping up and making things happen:

* She convinces Joffrey to save Dontos, simply because she couldn't bear to see an innocent man die.

* During the Battle of the Blackwater, Cersei tells Sansa that she has ordered Ilyn Payne to kill them both if it looks like they will lose. Then, when things really seem like they're going wrong, Cersei runs away, leaving Sansa to believe she's going to get beheaded at any second. However, instead of totally losing her cool like all the other noblewomen and elderly men hiding out with her, she takes charge and restores order to the situation.

* Even after being forced to marry the family of the people who killed her father, mother, and brother, she doesn't lose her ability to ACT courteous and polite. Sansa doesn't even get the opportunity to cry for her family, because the queen's eyes and ears are everywhere. She has to bottle everything up and still pretend to be happy...and she does it flawlessly.

* She realizes, without being told, that she is the one who carried the poison to Joffrey's wedding.

* She accurately pieces together Littlefinger's machinations with the Vale nobles.

Tl;dr if you really pay attention to Sansa chapters, she is nowhere near as dumb as people think she is. ",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,Bestof2012,True,t3_sgg9t,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/sgg9t/spoiler_all_rethinking_sansa/,

However, I think D and D have much more in store for Ros than the fanbase generally thinks.



When Sansa takes off with LF, I think the Lannister/Bolton alliance will pass off Ros as Sansa rather than a non-show-existent Jeyne as Arya. This makes sense for a couple reasons:


-Palatability on screen. The implication of a similarly-aged Arya stand in being brutally treated by Ramsay is a bit far for the show, which has made most acts more acceptable to the TV audience by aging up characters. 


-Previous history of abuse on screen. We have already seen Ros on the receiving end of abuse from Cersei. This creates a pattern and a built-in sympathy for Ros' plight. 


-Previous history with Theon. The potential for interaction between Theon and Ros has much more depth than Theon-Jeyne, based on their already established show relationship. Theon has fucked Ros, spoken extensively with her, even recommended her to Tyrion. This will make the reveal of Theon as Reek to Ros and the ""get her ready"" scene have much more gravity and emotion.


-Physical Similarity. Although one doesn't really think of them as physically similar, Ros and Sansa share enough traits to be passable, especially to a realm that knows little more than ""auburn hair, blue eyes.""

1370825454.0,415,self.asoiaf,1g0j43,[Spoilers All] The possibility of a certain character becoming a villain.,Hutchbugger,501,86,260,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1g0j43/spoilers_all_the_possibility_of_a_certain/,"There was another thread where this image was posted: http://imgur.com/BFSiIT8 which (I think?) got removed for being an image post but I wanted to actually discuss the possibility of it.

In my opinion it's (the image) actually a much more real possibility than you might think at first. At the very least I would say that most peoples expectations about Jon's future are completely on the wrong track.

Whenever GRRM talks about characters coming back to life in other fiction, he does it almost disdainfully. He is of the opinion that bringing a character back from the dead cheapens their deaths. Specifically he brings up Gandalf's death and return to life and the constant deaths and revivals in super hero comics. He says he never liked Gandalf the White and wishes Gandalf the Gray would have stayed dead. He says that the constant revivals in comics make death seem insignificant. Lady Stoneheart and Beric Dondarion are his answers to that trope. They get to come back, but instead of it being some great thing that improves their situation, it's horiffic, and they pretty much would have been better off dead. Beric slowly and sadly loses his identity and Stoneheart is almost an entirely new character fueled only by vengance and rage.

If we assume Jon's wounds at the end of ADWD were fatal (Though this is NOT as sure a thing as many people think), then a return to life can pretty much be expected based on all the unresolved details of his character, and the methods of resurrection that have been set up around him. What can absolutely NOT be expected is a return to business as usual for Jon. He death won't be a get out of jail free card that conveniently lets him drop his obligations to the Night's Watch. Instead, he will be changed significantly, both physically and mentally. These changes would likely be accompanied by a drastic shift in Jon's role in the story.

But what kind of shift? What seems likely, to me, is that Jon will become a sort of reverse Jaime. We need a POV to explore the lands of always winter, which we know we will see more of. It probably won't be Bran or Melisandre, and really what other options are there? Jon may very well join the Others in some capacity. It's doesn't even require him becoming totally ""evil"". Based on GRRM's ""wait and see"" comment when asked about the others being a one dimensional, evil force, we can expect that the Others are more than just simplistic bad guys. If you look for the ""A dragon plants no trees"" post it's likely that Dany will be the one fulfilling the role of the ""bad guy"". Maybe the Others are stirring in anticipation of the evil her dragons will bring. Maybe the giant wall made of ICE was actually made by the people who we know are extremely skilled at magically manipulating ice. And who better to figure that out than the one character who has the best track record at looking past his preconceptions of people(Tyrion/Satin/Wildlings)? There is certainly precedent for rouge Nights Watch Lord Commanders joining the Others. There is also precedent for a quasi-wight/warg character in Coldhands, who is clearly dead and yet seems to function fine. That fits with Bran's dream in AGOT where Jon becomes ""cold and hard"" at the wall. He is being foreshadowed to be Azor Ahai, but a straight fulfillment of the prophesy is unlikely. The outcast young man, skilled at fighting, rising to prove himself through hardships, who eventually battles against the great army of evil and then discovers he was the true heir to the Kingdom all along is the most cliche fantasy story line in existence, and entirely uncharacteristic of GRRM. GRRM has said he considers the Starks the heroes of the story, but Jon is a Snow.

1361298791.0,413,self.asoiaf,18txqb,(Spoilers ALL) Regarding Shae the Funny Whore,A_Polite_Noise,534,121,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/18txqb/spoilers_all_regarding_shae_the_funny_whore/,"I'd like to talk about Shae, and the tragic love affair she has with Tyrion.  It seems that a lot - most, even - of the readers I encounter online believe that Shae was using Tyrion for his $$$.  There are theories that Tywin or someone else ""planted"" her in the army's camp, and that the whole thing was a plot to take Tyrion down from the beginning.  I disagree as strongly as possible.


It seems like everyone looks at Tyrion's constant fretting and telling himself about how Shae is a whore and doesn't love him and is only there because of the money is part of his cleverness; bordering on prescience, he can ""see through the falsehoods"", and the tragedy is only that despite knowing all along he allows himself to play along.  I think that people tend to forgive Tyrion too quickly; all of the characters have their good and bad aspects, in differing percentages, in this series.  Tyrion is no different.  Being a fan favorite (and perhaps also being someone many fans might relate to, seeing themselves as clever and bookish and shunned unfairly by those around them), Tyrion seems to get a free pass on many of his failings and sins.



What is often looked upon as a very good piece of advice from Tyrion is, I think, emblematic of his flaws and encapsulates one of the major themes of the series:  he tells Jon to never forget what he is, because the world surely won't; he should wear it like armor so it cannot be used to hurt him.  However, this situation of identity, self identity, and identity as perceived by others is a major theme of the series.  People are constantly shifting identities, taking on disguises and false names, taking on new positions of power or lack thereof (from Hand to prisoner in the dungeon, from Lady to false bastard, from mummer to Lord of Whispers, from wilding to Lord Commander, etc.).  Who is Jon Snow?  Is he Eddard's bastard, or a Targaryen?  Is he AA come again?  Is Arya no one?  Identity is key.  And Tyrion bases identity on the opinions of *others*.


As many times as he seems to be cocky and sure and confident, more often than not it is a cover for the fact that he *does* internalize what others think of him and give it more credence than his own opinions of his self-worth.  He never forgets who he is *to other people*.  And so, to me, it isn't prescience or cleverness that tells him that because of his short stature and appearance no one can ever love him, and because of Shae's occupation as a whore she could never love him and is only around for the money.  To me that is him ignoring the evidence before him, constantly telling himself that what he sees and judges and weights with his own clever mind and his eyes is *false*; that what he sees *cannot be true* because *she and I are not possibly more than the sum of our parts; I am an unlovable freak, and she is an unloving whore.  Period.*



This, of course, mimics and sheds light on who quickly, how *readily* he believed the lie about his first wife.  *Of course* it was all a ruse and she was paid; how could it *possibly* have been real love?  When he finds out that what he had assumed was a deception for so long was true, it turns his entire idea of his identity and self-worth out the window...and as a result he collapses and tears down all the relationships that he *had* cherished post-Tysha (namely his brotherly love with Jaime and his relationship with Shae).



Many look to Shae's betrayal at the trial as proof that she was only in for the money, and never loved him, and perhaps had been a spy planted for this end all along.  I think that is unfair to Shae (and part of a larger unfairness to female characters that you see with Cat and Sansa too, but we won't get into that just now).  Shae was the private personal companion of Tyrion when he was Hand, but she was no fool.  It was clear, if not from Tyrion's own words then from her ability to see the situation, that despite the title Tyrion was not exactly the most respected of Lannisters.  It was made clear to her from the start that Tywin did not want her in King's Landing; that she was there in a clandestine manner, hidden, and that there was danger for her even while protected by the Hand of the King.  When Tyrion's status is destroyed and he is accused of regicide and kinslaying both, all of her protection is gone.


Now she is in the hands of Tywin.  She is in the hands of Cersei.  She is the consort of the already-hated imp who is now accused of killing the boy king; her status is even lower because of that than the lowliest street whore.  She is the whore of a treasonous monster.  So what else could she do?  Even if she loved him with all her heart, how many characters...even those armed and trained to fight, those with status, would suffer what Cersei (Qyburn!) and Tywin would do to her if she did not bury Tyrion?  No one is saying she is the bravest or most noble characters, but I think it is too much to deny her love.



So she said ""Giant of Lannister"".  Some would say that is evidence; why use that phrase she had shared with him if it wasn't all a lie?  Well, put up on a seat before the regal court, forced to bury Tyrion, seeing people of higher status and position in safer situations destroy Tyrion...she grasped onto the phrase she had said possibly dozens of times to him in their time together...no one said she is a mummer, or a perfect deceiver.  It was always on the tip of her tongue when she spoke to him, and she may have known how damning it sounded.  So she said it.  She didn't seem happy when she did; some would argue it was because she was a brilliant actress putting on the performance of the abused prostitute of a monster.  But maybe it was because she felt guilty.



Then she said it again in Tywin's bedchamber.  Why would she betray Tyrion for Tywin, you may ask.  For the same reasons she did it at court:  she is one of the last safe characters in King's Landing at this point; you do *not* deny the requests of the Hand of the King at this point.  Tyrion was doomed, and love him or not, she needed *safety*.  So she put on her best smile and did what she had done for years:  warmed someones bed.  The fact that she made the mistake of using the same words she used to damn him *was*, as Tyrion said, the ""wrong thing to say"".  But it is not an indication of her lying; she had said it dozens, if not hundreds (unseen to us between chapters) of times to him *in love*.  She had only said it once, in a panic state, before the entire royal court, to damn him.  It would have been quick on her lips, an automatic response...and yes, *the wrong thing to say*.


And so Tyrion, in his wroth, murdered her.  And murdered his father.  And then, racked with guilt, drank and drank and drank.  Even he, in ADWD, talks about his sins against Shae; while some readers say ""That bitch got whats coming; she just wanted the money!"", even at one point in his drunken journey Tyrion himself has a moment, a twinge, of regret.  He murdered her, and it was not a moment to cheer at.  It is his sin...she said the wrong thing, but he acted in pain and despair.  Acted too quickly.



What supports this for me is that the episode in season 2 that Martin himself wrote makes much of the love between Shae and Tyrion, and drops no hints (a writer *notorious* for hints both subtle and obvious) that she is false.  If anything, his season 2 episode *strengthens* their love...


Many would say that when Tyrion murders Shae, it is righteous; it is him finally doing what he knew he should have done all along.  I think it is tragic and horrifying, and I think that is how the show will present it, and that's how the chapter in A Storm of Swords always read to me:  A tragic, sad, end to what may have been real love, and a display of Tyrion's great flaw in never forgetting what he was *to others*, and what Shae was *to others*, and completely forgetting what they were *to each other*.


**TL;DR**:  Shae loved Tyrion and wasn't just in it for the $$$; she betrayed him for survival, not malice or as the final act of a longterm deception.  Tyrion did a horrible thing in killing her in his anger and pain, and it is a key component of the change in him to a drunken, regretful, vile monster (truly becoming what the world has always thought he is, instead of what he knew he was) in ADWD.

Joffrey is the epitome of a spoiled, neglected rich-kid. Both of his parents have failed him, (all three really.) I'm a firm believer that if you kid grows up to be a snot-nosed little brat, it's your fucking fault, and it's truly a tragedy. Cruelty is a learned behavior. Joffrey has spent his entire life yearning for the acceptance and love of his father, which he never got. Joffrey never had a true father figure (or a mother figure really.) All of the cruel things he does are for attention and acceptance. He believe that Bobby B will only love him if he shows he is ""strong,"" however nobody has ever taken the time to instill what true strength is into Joff, or any real virtues for that matter. He has been neglected by everybody who is supposed to love and raise him. Combine that with being born an heir to a kingdom, you've got a recipe for spoiled-brat syndrome. Now, I'm not saying that anything Joffrey does is justified or right, what I'm saying is that what he does, he does to fill the void inside of him. The void that should be filled with a parent's love and guidance. He's the sociopath that was raised by a host of nannies and butlers.

Let's contrast Jon with Joff. Had Ned Stark not been a stand up dude and raised him with the same love as he did for the rest of his children, Jon could've easily turned into the same, resentful, hate-harboring bastard that Joff is. Jon even plays on this when he meets Mance (""Did you see where they sat the bastard?"")

Daddy's always drunk + Mommy's always drunk + both think their jobs are more important than you = one fucked up kid. Now give that kid a kingdom and see what happens.


It's hard for me to truly hate Joffrey (not that I *like him* neccesarily, but I can understand why he thinks being such a cockbag is what's ""right."") Everything Joffrey does, he does because all he's wanted his whole life is a fucking hug. Everything Joffrey became, he became because nobody ever gave a fuck enough to teach him otherwise.

While I pondered weak and weary  
Over many a cumbersome scroll from Lord Commanders of yore,   
In the yard I hear jeering, clapping,  
My direwolf his water lapping,  
And the sound of black wings flapping,  
And suddenly there is a rapping,  
Rapping upon my chamber door.  
'Tis the Maester’s seasonal chore…  
The end of Autumn and nothing more.  

Ah, distinctly I remember, the creaking of the timber,  
The tower glowing like an ember,  
And on they came, like waves upon the shore.  
Our green boys some still unshaven,  
Our cloaks blacker than the raven,  
Yet none dare ever call us craven... ""  


You know nothing,"" I heard her implore.  


For the rare and fire-kissed maiden lay bleeding upon the floor.  


Nameless here forevermore.  


Presently my heart starts beating,  
Recalling all the moments fleeting  
Every of her jape and torment  
Stirred my desire that lay dormant.  
And all at once my honor crumbled,  
Inside the cave where we both stumbled  


I approached shyly as she undressed,  
And broke my vows upon her breast.  


Everything done has been done before,  
And there’s too many lost in this long war,  
And I fear there will be many more…  


 ""You know nothing"", she would implore.  


My direwolf on the floor is napping,  
And yet still I hear a rapping,  
Of Clydas patiently tapping,  
I rise, no longer able to ignore.  
And the gaunt face that greets me,  
Solemnly entreats me  
To let him pass beyond my chamber door.  
As he enters my safe haven,  
And offers corn unto my raven,  
I ask him what he came here for.  


As he explains, his voice starts quaking,  
And his outstretched hand starts shaking,  
A message sealed in pink comes to the fore.  


Titled “Bastard” and nothing more.  


I feel an awful dread a waking,  
And as I read a sweat starts breaking,  
He thinks the Stark home his for the taking.  


By the gods, how much longer must I endure?  


Quorked the Raven “Forevermore”  


On Northern throne he is still seated,  
And claims Stannis has been defeated,  
And with his wicked bastard blade  
Saw that the Rayder’s wives were flayed  
And offers me a coward’s trade.  


Aye, I’ll trade for the Rayder Mance,  
But with sword and axe and torch and lance,  
He’ll soon find the true cost of war…  


“You know nothing” I heard her implore  


I speak to my men, my spirits soaring,  
Like a fountain, my words come pouring,  
Then I hear a thunderous roaring,  
Roaring outside my chamber door.  


“Tis the wind and nothing more”  


As I approach, I hear a thrashing,  
Of Ser Patrek’s head a bashing,  
Crashing against my chamber floor.  


Tis our giant making war.  
Only this and nothing more.  


Upon my person, a hand is grabbing,  
And suddenly a knife is stabbing,  
My throat, my belly, my shoulder blade,  
“For the Watch” I hear, and start to fade.  

 
All around, the world grows colder,  
And I weep for what I ne'er told her,  
To lay my head upon her shoulder,  
Is all I want and nothing more.  


Quorked the raven “Nevermore”

It's that time again, the **Third Annual ASOIAF Tournament** is upon us!

Have you ever wondered whether Robert Baratheon could defeat Eddard Stark in a one-on-one fight? This fun, creative exercise is the closest you'll have to finding out! Sports fans have their March Madness. We crows have the 2013 **A Song of Ice and Fire Tournament** instead, a tradition that dates back [literally years](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/wiki/tournaments). This year, however, we aren't just taking brawn into consideration. Read on to learn more.

***

**--Background/Rules--**

* The tournament in 2011 was a very basic tournament where we simply voted for who we thought would win in a 1-v-1 fight. It ended with Barristan Selmy defeating Arthur Dayne. The tournament in 2012 was a more complicated version, where we had people write out fight scenarios, fictional encounters of who might or could defeat who in single combat, and the crows voted for which scenario they liked most. Sandor Clegane defeated Garlan Tyrell in that version. [See here for more information](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/wiki/tournaments) or just to relive the days of yore. As for 2013? Well... let us tell you about 2013: it is going to be legend (wait for it...)...

* This year is going to be **Warriors** versus **Players**. No longer shall only the strength of one's arm determine whether or not a character can win all the glory! One whole conference will be Warriors, just like normal: the strongest, the bravest, the toughest. The other will be Players, such as: Tyrion, Wyman Manderly, the Damphair, Arya, even Varys-- any character who may not survive long in a one on one fight against, say, Gregor Clegane but who, due to their wits and cunning and subterfuge, could figure out a way to defeat their opponent in other ways.

* In the Warriors bracket the writeups will go as normal with a fighting scenario: who wins in a fight, the Mountain or Ned Stark? Darrio or Rhaegar? The scenarios should explain, in some form, who would win and why: who is faster, stronger; who is better equipped, better trained. A well written scenario might make even Pod seem like the Sword of the Morning so it truly is anyone's game. 

* In the Players bracket the scenarios will be about how one player assassinates the other. How he or she conspires to manipulate events in order to defeat their chosen foe. Does Littlefinger convince Asha to poison her father, Balon? Does Arya warg into one of Tommen's kittens to trip Joffery, sending him falling down a flight of stairs to his death? Or are the mechanachians of Prince Doran so insidious and complex that even Varys didn't realize that his most trusted ""little bird"" was an Dornish assassin the entire time? These factors will be played out, and written by you crows, for the Players bracket!

* The finals will be a **Trial by Two** scenario. The winner of the Player bracket will team up with the runner-up of the Warrior bracket. The winner of the Warrior bracket will be teamed up with the runner-up of the Player bracket. So if Lord Petyr Baelish defeats Lord Varys to get to the final round, Varys will counsel his opposing Warrior for the final battle. And if Gregor Clegane defeats Eddard Stark to reach the final round, Ned will fight with the help of Littlefinger. The enemy they just vanquished in the previous round returns to get revenge. Well written scenarios by you crows will ensue and then we all get to vote on them, argue them, and cry foul when our favorite scenario loses... or brag forevermore if our favorite scenario wins (especially if we're the one who wrote it!).

* We are going to continue the tradition of not allowing any previous winners, or runners-up, to participate in this competition. Selmy, Dayne, Sandor, Garlan - all out. They cannot be nominated this year. Take heart though: with the Players bracket added, a huge amount of characters have been added to the selecting pool.

* Most of the specific rules are going to be copied from last year, which you can [view here](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/yhrgv/2012_asoiaf_tournament_central_hub/). The only major difference between this year and last year when it comes to formatting the voting will be the utilization of ""contest mode.""

***

**--Schedule of events--**

* Tomorrow we will post a thread where you can vote on participants. The highest 16 for each bracket (Warriors and Players) will go on to play in the tournament. We will use a traditional 32 person bracket format using rankings, which you can [view here](http://www.printyourbrackets.com/pdfbrackets/32teamsingleseeded.pdf). For example, if Gregor Clegane gets the highest votes tomorrow - and Balon Swann squeaks into the tournament with the lowest votes, they will face each other in the first round.

* On Friday we will post the official brackets completely filled out.

* On Sunday the first ""Scenario Submission Thread"" will open, and then we will follow the specific weekly format as described in [""Weekly Event Schedule"" on this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/yhrgv/2012_asoiaf_tournament_central_hub/)

We look forward to participating in this with you,

and as always your humble servants,

So who or what is Ned Stark, really?

Ned is a specimen uncommon to Westeros. The world of ASOIAF permits many different people to get by. Pragmatic power players at the continental level abound, and they succeed by virtue of their ability to make better chess moves than other pragmatists and sweeping the naive and the cocksure out of their way. Below them, people come in a variety of forms. Knights trying to build a reputation and gain glory through a dichotomous life of brutal conflict and courtly demeanor, sellswords readily embrace a seedy reputation and line of work for their shot at a big score, women adapt to their station in society by trying to use their femininity as a weapon or a tool.

But Ned is a rare man. Others see a world where power is a constant, a god of sorts. For Ned, honor is the only god. He is an exemplar of stoicism. A lifetime's worth of pain and loss was forced upon him when he was barely an adult, and he has born the consequences of those unexpected losses with tremendous humility and self-doubt. 

You know what intrigues me about Ned? I have absolutely *no idea* what Ned wants. Almost every character in this series, I have some idea what they want. Oh, there are characters who are enigmatic, sure. Do I know what Varys or Petyr want in detail, for certain? No, but I know that at some level, it's power and control. I know what drives the others too, be it love or spite or respect or fear or psychosis. But I simply don't know about Ned. He didn't want the throne, hell he didn't even want to be Lord of Winterfell. Can a person really exist in this universe who lives simply to do what they believe is right, and nothing more?

So what is Ned? Is he largely a plot device? Is he the vessel through which we are given much of the Starks' history in the first book, and through whom we come to appreciate their family? And then, in perhaps the truest sense, does he exist so that he can die and set in motion the war that will come to dominate the rest of the series?

Or is Ned's story meant to be a parable, and if so, what are we supposed to take away from it? Do we look at his life, his actions, and his fate and conclude that in a world where you cannot trust ideals to supplant your fellow man's base nature, honor is an empty value, and as such it should be maligned? Or should we view it such that honor makes a life something more virtuous than what it was otherwise, and Ned's death, for choosing honor rather than what some realists might call the ""smart choices"", is a testament to the horrific injustice that has permeated Westerosi society?

There are complications to these questions too, I feel. The evidence mostly supports the idea that Ned is one of the truly honorable men in the kingdoms, but the biggest mystery we've yet to unravel is his relationship to Jon Snow. The most commonly accepted ideas at this point are either that R+L=J, and that Ned's promise to Lyanna has been to conceal Jon as his ""bastard"" son for his safety, or that Jon is indeed Ned's son by an as-of-yet undetermined woman. What does the true outcome mean for his honor, and for how we view him? Is he not the man we think of if he really did stray from his wife? Is he even nobler than we could imagine for being willing to take the stain on his honor of claiming a bastard that isn't his, when only he will ever know the truth?

Sometimes, I wonder if perhaps Ned died at the Tower of Joy. He lost a brother and a father. He went to war and sent thousands of his men to their deaths to help his friend and throw down a monstrous ruler. And when he finally reached the place where his missing sister had been hidden for so long, he arrived just in time for her dying words and the loss of the last of his family besides Benjen. What must he have felt, his history burnt to ashes and his destiny to return to a castle he did not feel he deserved, honors he did not want, and a wife whose very existence must have reminded him of the brother she was pledged to marry first? Was he the same man he had been in his youth? Could any lifetime of happiness have made up for what had happened to him and the burdens he went on to bear? I really don't know.

What do you think about Ned?

Introduction
-
In my [first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1hibqm/spoilers_all_a_complete_analysis_of_robb_stark_as/), I laid out my initial case on Robb Stark as the greatest tactician and the worst strategist of the War of the 5 Kings. In this post, I will continue exploring Robb's military campaign as it heads into tactical victory after tactical victory in the Westerlands. Yet amidst these victories, Robb paved the way for the great strategic defeat of the Northern Rebellion through poor endstate conception.

When we left Robb yesterday, he had just accomplished the unthinkable. He and his army had defeated Jaimie Lannister in the field, smashed the Lannister host outside of Riverrun and forced Tywin to withdraw back towards Harrenhal. Crowned king by river and northern lords shortly thereafter, Robb began to turn his focus westward.

Politics by Another Means
-

&gt; ""Dad, how do soldiers killing each other solve the world's problems?""  - Calvin &amp; Hobbes, *Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday Pages 1985-1995*  

I left out a lot of the political side of the equation yesterday, somewhat intentionally. I didn't want to review the dealings with the Freys, northern lords or lords of the Riverlands, because well, honestly I'm not anywhere close to an expert, and I wanted to jump right into the military tactics and strategy. But I'll try in an attempt to summarize as it relates to the Robb's military strategy.

What was the endstate of Robb's objective in fighting this war against the Lannisters? We get an idea of his objective when Robb instructs Cleos Frey of his demands to give to KL. He says the following:

&gt; ""Lastly, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claims to dominion over the north. Henceforth we are no part of their realm, but a free and independent kingdom, as of old. Our domain shall include all the Stark lands north of the Neck, and in addition the lands watered by the River Trident and its vassal streams, bounded by the Golden Tooth to the west and the Mountains of the Moon in the east."" - *ACOK, Chapter 7, Catelyn I*

Essentially, Robb's stated ambition was the control of half of Westeros. However, a little further down, Catelyn makes this curious observation:

&gt; ""But bearded or no, he was still a youth of fifteen, and wanted vengeance no less than Rickard Karstark.""

Revenge as an endstate is not a clear goal or objective (As the BWB will come to find out with Stoneheart at the healm). It has a cataract effect on the individual and has the ability to make the mission and endstate of a war unclear or at least myopic.

Anyways, Robb used a combination of honor and strategic alliances to strengthen his position prior to his movement to Riverrun and thereafter. The marriage-promise alliance with the Freys was key to his army's crossing into the Riverlands and key to shoring up the number of soldiers (particularly levy infantrymen) he had at his disposal. Furthermore, the rescue of Riverrun gave Robb command of the levies and knights of the Riverlands. However, it also had the effect of expanding the territory which Robb was forced to defend.

Realizing he needed more allies to win his war, Robb made his worst political decision. He sent Theon Greyjoy to Pyke to propose an alliance between the Greyjoys and the Starks. Releasing the only factor that kept the Greyjoys from roaring back into rebellion, he figured he could trust his closest friend. What he failed to recognize is that blood ties run deeper than friendship ties. Not even ill-treatment by an emotionally abusive, asshole father could keep dissuade Theon from becoming the turncloak. Even Catelyn, not known for being the most foresighted politician in Westeros, realizes this.

&gt; ""I'll say again, I would sooner you sent someone else to Pyke, and kept Theon close to you."" - *ACOK, Chapter 7, Catelyn I*

His other political decision was only foolish in retrospect. He sent his mother south to entreat with Renly Baratheon. Now, my intent is not to start a debate on whether this was the morally correct choice, but rather, to argue that it made the most **pragmatic** sense to ally with the strongest anti-Lannister faction in the realm. Of course, that ended in complete disaster, but not on account of Catelyn's attempts.

I'll leave it for there on the political side.


Tit for Tat: The Westerlands Campaign
-

&gt; ""The Young Wolf was paying the Lannisters back in kind for the devastation they'd inflicted on the riverlands."" - *ACOK, Chapter 39, Catelyn V*

[Simple Map of Disposition of Forces Prior to Start of the Westerlands Campaign](http://imgur.com/sVtp9B2) (**Note**: I ~~may have~~ placed Roose Bolton's host too far north on my map. [A wiki of ice and fire](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/b/b2/War_in_the_North3.png) has Roose just east of the Twins at this time.)

Following the Battle of the Camps, Robb reorganized his host and prepared to move west. The general thrust of this strategy was that the Lannisters were weak and divided by geography. Tywin Lannister was in an extremely tough spot. Renly Baratheon and his Tyrell allies were slowly advancing northeast towards King's Landing while Robb Stark and the Tullys were northwest of his position.

In this position, Robb made a fateful decision. He decided to move West to attack the Westerlands. He left Edmure Tully in command of the Riverlands. After leaving (vague - we'll get to this in pt 3) instructions to Edmure Tully, Robb Stark and Brynden Blackfish led a (again) mostly mounted force west.

Now here I'm going to admit confusion. Was Robb's intent to take the Westerlands while they were weak, sacking and burning the Westerlands? Or was it rather like what Brynden Tully says to Edmure in ASOS?

&gt; ""We planned to run Lord Tywin a merry chase up and down the coast, then slip behind him to take up a strong defensive position athwart the gold road, at a place my scouts had found where the ground would have been greatly in our favor..."" - *ASOS, Chapter 14, Catelyn II*

To this end, I'm not entirely sure whether this was the strategy or a way for Robb Stark and Brynden Tully to CYA for their failures, but again, I'll get to that later. 

Turning back to the Westerlands campaign, Robb and the Blackfish learned that a new Lannister host was being raised at Oxcross by Tywin Lannister's cousin Ser Stafford Lannister. The problem in confronting this force lay in the terrain. The road leading to Oxcross ran into the Golden Tooth with high mountains running west to east on both sides. The Golden Tooth was a traditional choke-point to the movement of any Army towards Lannisport and Casterly Rock. The question of how to get around the Golden Tooth probably plagued Robb (We don't know - no POV sadly), but a solution came to him at some point: GreyWind.

&gt; ""He (Robb) slipped around it at night. It's said the direwolf showed him the way..."" - *ACOK, Chapter 39, Catelyn V*

One of the more interesting responses I received yesterday came from /u/I_Said who [posited that Robb warged into Greywind](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1hibqm/spoilers_all_a_complete_analysis_of_robb_stark_as/cav4q0o?context=3) to accomplish this task. I don't have an opinion on it, but it's plausible to me that Robb would use the wolf and his senses to accomplish this objective. Bran warged into Summer to save Jon Snow for instance, but I digress.

Having successfully passed through the Golden Tooth without detection, Robb continued in his good tactical footing by having the Blackfish and his scouts kill any Lannister outriders. There were few enough to kill, as Stafford Lannister foolishly believed that he was completely safe on account of the terrain. (Note: no matter how great your position is, a dedicated enemy can and will find a way to kill you.) The Lannister scouts dead, Robb descended on the host utilizing one of my favorite terms: **violence of action**, that is: moving quickly and violently in order to leave your enemies, scattered, leaderless and unable to defend themselves from the onslaught. The result was a rout. The new Lannister host was destroyed, Ser Stafford Lannister was dead and the Westerlands were ripe for plunder.

Ashemark fell to the Stark/Tully host and was sacked partially in retribution for the burning that the Lannisters did in the Riverlands, but more practically to re-supply his Army. Galbart Glover and Rickard Karstark raided the coast along the coast of the Sunset Sea, the Mormonts captured livestock and sent the cattle back to Riverrun. Finally and most importantly, the Greajon Umber seized the goldmines in Castamere. This seizure of the gold and denial of a source of income may have been the linchpin which forced Tywin to move west, though that's a topic for debate. 

While Robb's leal lords upended the Westerland economy, Robb moved toward the Craig...

Conclusion
-

I did not get as far as I wanted to in this post, meaning that I'll do a part 3 next week (if folks are interested) which will deal with Edmure/Roose, the Westerlings and y'know finally delve into my theory of Robb as the worst strategic thinker of the War of the Five Kings. I hope I've demonstrated enough in this post and the previous one how formidable of a tactician I think Robb was (Remember, I think he was the greatest tactician in the war) and set the stage for why I consider Robb the worst strategist.

1365955854.0,400,self.asoiaf,1cbwef,(Spoilers All) Complete Analysis: The Blackfyre claim to the throne and illegitimacy of the current Targaryen line.,pimpst1ck,476,76,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1cbwef/spoilers_all_complete_analysis_the_blackfyre/,"About a month ago, u/SawRub posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/19j3j5/spoilers_all_is_it_possible_that_daenerys_isnt/) thread, considering that Daemon Blackfyre was the true heir to the Iron Throne based on the argument that Daeron II was an illegimate offspring of Naerys and Aemon the Dragonknight (from henceforth N+A=DII).  I thought this theory deserved a full exposition, including its possible impact on the Golden Company

*Note: This theory assumes that Aegon ""Young Griff"" Targaryen is in fact a Blackfyre.  You can argue over this elsewhere, I'm just making an assumption for arguments sale*

**1. The Accusation**

One of the biggest reasons for the Blackfyre rebellion was the accusation that King Daeron II The Good was not the trueborn son of Aegon IV and his sister-wife Naerys, but rather of Naerys and his younger brother Prince Aemon the Dragonknight.  Here are some of the main reasons why.



* Naerys loathed her husband, and was often distraught when he flaunted his many mistresses at court

* Prince Aemon was one of the only two people who could make Naerys smile.  The other was her son Daeron - possible link.

* Naerys was slandered by Ser Morgil for some yet unknown reason.  Prince Aemon was famous for defending her honor and slaying Ser Morgil.  The slander could possibly have been of her affair with Prince Aemon, thus raising the stakes for Prince Aemon, requiring his to die.

The accusation was no doubt well known, as testified by Maester Aemon about his namesake

&gt;My grandfather named me for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, who was his uncle, or his father, depending on which tale you believe (AGOT)

And Aemon's love for Naerys was also testified by Sansa

&gt;Prince Aemon the Dragonknight cried the day Princess Naerys wed his brother Aegon (ACOK)

Therefore the circumstances regarding the possible affair were certainly well known.

This accusations answers the question why Aegon IV decided to legitimise all his bastards on his deathbed.  Aegon IV had already acknowledged Daemon I after Baelor I's death and even given his the ancestral Targaryen Valyrian sword *Blackfyre*, causing people to talk about Daemon becoming his heir.  Yet despite all this, Aegon IV never legitimised him.  Then on his deathbed Aegon IV legitimises not only Daemon, but ALL his acknowledged bastards (Bittersteel, Bloodraven and Shiera Seastar), even though Daemon was the eldest and the only one with pure Targaryen ancestry (his mother was Daena the Defiant).

If for some reason Aegon IV discovered N+A=DII (maybe Naerys told him as a last ""Fuck you"", or maybe discovered some other way too late), he would realise that would put Daeron II behind all his bastards in the line of succession.  So as his last act, Aegon IV legitimises all his bastards, thus putting them on equal standing to Daeron II and letting them sort it out for themselves.  This is also consistent with Aegon IV's character, as he showed certain affection towards his sons (bastards or not), but didn't really care about the fate of the realm.

**2. Parallels with the present timeline**

One of the most compelling arguments for N+A=DII comes not from evidence present in the story, but in the literary parallels between Aegon IV and Robert I.

* Both Aegon VI started their reigns young and handsome, and ended fat, drunkards and corrupt.

* Both rulers were more or less completely arbitrary about governing the realm, with exception to war (Aegon IV's invasion of Dorne and the Greyjoy Rebellion)

* Both rulers were notorious womanisers and had multiple whores and mistresses.  Both were fine flaunting it in front of their significant others.

* Both rulers had wives who utterly loathed them

* Both rulers' wives were accused of incest with their younger brothers, their dearest companions

* Both died leaving a huge succession crisis, both instigated in les than honourable ways (Aegon IV legitimises his bastards on his deathbed; Robert names Joffrey his heir on his deathbed, but Ned changes it to ""my heir"")

* Both had sons accused of being bastard abominations ascend to the throne in wars of succession (Blackfyre Rebellion, War of Five Kings)

* Both sired numerous bastards used in the succession wars (Bloodraven/Bittersteel, Edric Storm as proof of Joffery's illegitimacy)

As shown above, the amount of parallels between Aegon IV and Robert I is seemingly too uncanny to just be mere coincidences.

**3. Parallels with real history: Henry VII**

As said above, let's assume Aegor VI is indeed a Blackfyre by female descent.  He is the son of Illyrio Mopatis and his dead wife Serra, who was reputed to have Targaryen features, including golden hair with a silver streak (fun fact, this is the reverse of Elaena Targaryen, Daena's sister, who had silver hair with a golden streak - possible tinfoil reference to inverted Blackfyre colours).  Thus when the male line of Blackfyres died out with Maelys the Monstrous, only the female line remained.  Aegon Blackfyre's ancestry would share similar traits to that of Henry Tudor, also known as Henry VII of England.

Henry Tudor's claim to the English Throne was quite weak.  Not only was it derived from his mother, but also through illegitimate birth later legitimised.  His ancestor was John of Gaunt, the 3rd son of Edward III.  John of Gaunt already had four children by his mistress Katherine Swynford before they married, making them technically illegitimate.  Richard II, John of Gaunt's nephew, officially declared them legitimate.  However when John of Gaunt's son by his first wife Henry IV came to the throne, he upheld their legitimacy, but disqualified from the line of succession (although this wasn't really legal, it just weakened Henry Tudor's claim).  Henry Tudor's claim came from his mother Margaret Beaufort, who was granddaughter to John Beaufort, one of the offspring of Jon of Gaunt and Katherine Swynford.

Therefore in terms of claims we see similar circumstances between Henry Tudor and Aegon Blackfyre.  Both come from legitimised bastards who were disqualified from succession, and both derive their claim from their mothers.  Yet it goes deeper.

Firstly let us quickly remind ourselves of the similarities between Richard III and Stannis Baratheon that others have pointed out.  Both previously were loyal to their families, but upon the monarch's death, both killed their younger brothers and claimed their nephews were illegitimate.  Both would be fair and just rulers but are despised by everyone.

When Henry Tudor came to claim the throne of England, much of his success derived from there being no more male Lancastrian candidates.  On top of that, the line his mother belonged to, House of Beaufort had also recently died in the male line in battle, thus leaving no other Beauforts descended from John of Gaunt.  Henry had spent 14 years across the English channel in Brittany and France, where he borrowed supplies and soldiers from Lancastrian loyalists and jumped back across the channel attempting a quick invasion. 

Sound familiar?  Some of the more important details:

* Both Aegon Blackfyre and Henry Tudor have claims derived from their mother and legitimised bastards

* Both have been in exile across a narrow sea, eventually gathering supplies and troops from loyalists

* Beaufort = Blackfyre, both similar sounding names. Would fall in with York = Stark + Baratheon/Tully alliance and Lancaster = Lannister + Lannister/Baratheon offspring.

* Opponents include Stannis Barathon/Richard III

**4. Implications with the Golden Company**

One of the pieces of evidence used for the Blackfyre theory is that the Golden Company, the most loyal sellsword company known, dropping their contract to aid Aegon.  The Golden Company was founded by Aegor ""Bittersteel"" Rivers after the Blackfyre rebellion, when he saw exiled Westerosi Lord and Knights disbanding.  Even today, the Golden Company is filled with many descended from Blackfyre loyalists.

Most notable of these include the current and previous Captain-Generals of the company, Homeless Harry Strickland and Myles Toyne.  Now Harry Strickland comes from four generations of men in the Golden Company, right back to when his house was exiled from the Seven Kingdoms - going right back to his house's Blackfyre allegiance.

Previous to him was Myles Toyne, who is descended from Torrence Toyne, a Kingsguard knight who caught sleeping with one of Aegon IV's mistresses, resulting in him being slowly executed by dismemberment.  Following this Torrence's brothers attempted to kill Aegon IV, but were foiled by Prince Aemon who sacrificed his life to save Aegon IV.  Considering if N+A=DII, that would have meant the Toynes would have a strong antagonism against the memory of Prince Aemon.  Thus who better than to organise the Golden Company for a plot that would disgrace the memory of Aemon the Dragonknight?  Myles Toyne died in 297 AL, meaning by then he most certainly would have been contacted by Varys/Illyrio to assure their allegience.  Tristan Rivers mentioned the previous plan of Viserys joining them with the Dothraki, so this speculation can fairly be taken for granted.

**TL;DR** Therefore, the Targaryen line from Daeron II is illegitimate (including Danaerys), and the true line was the Blackfyres, due to Daeron II being the illegitimate son of Naerys and Aemon the Dragonknight (N+A=DII).  This is supported in the text as well as literary comparison between Robert I and Aegon IV

Also Aegon ""Young Griff"" Blackfyre is Henry Tudor, descended from the House of Beaufont.

&gt;That took Lord Janos aback. He smiled uncertainly and began to sweat, but Bowen Marsh beside him said, “Who better to command the black cloaks than a man who once commanded the gold, sire?”


&gt;“Any of you, I would think. Even the cook.” The look the king gave Slynt was cold. “Janos was hardly the first gold cloak ever to take a bribe, I grant you, but he may have been the first commander to fatten his purse by selling places and promotions. By the end he must have had half the officers in the City Watch paying him part of their wages. Isn’t that so, Janos?”Slynt’s neck was purpling. “Lies, all lies! A strong man makes enemies, Your Grace knows that, they whisper lies behind your back. Naught was ever proven, not a man came forward . . . ”


&gt;“Two men who were prepared to come forward died suddenly on their rounds.” Stannis narrowed his eyes. “Do not trifle with me, my lord. I saw the proof Jon Arryn laid before the small council. If I had been king you would have lost more than your office, I promise you, but Robert shrugged away your little lapses. ‘They all steal,’ I recall him saying. ‘Better a thief we know than one we don’t, the next man might be worse.’ Lord Petyr’s words in my brother’s mouth, I’ll warrant. Littlefinger had a nose for gold, and I’m certain he arranged matters so the crown profited as much from your corruption as you did yourself.**”**

&gt;“The singers may do as they like,” Stannis snapped. “Spare me your fawning, Janos, it will not serve you.” He rose to his feet and frowned at them all.**""**

4\. **Unconfirmed But Possible POVs**

- Not going to table this, but I'm not sure if **Jon** will return as a POV (or if he's alive or will return in some form). I don't think I need to link to threads on Jon as it is one of the more popular topics on this sub, but I can and will if requested.
- ~~**Catelyn** - This is tinfoil at best, but I'd love to read a Stoneheart POV and understand the complexities, horror, terrors, thought, feelings (if any) of an undead person. GRRM has said (can't find the source at the moment) that there will be no more POV chapters, but is it possible to bring back Catelyn's perspective? I think it may give us a window both into her newfound personality as well as give some small insight into the personality and activities of wights.~~ /u/feldman10 [linked](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1115) to a So Spake Martin where GRRM said, ""And by the way, there will no Catelyn POVs in future volumes, which may tell you something."" 

Anyways, thanks for reading. Did I catch everything? If I missed something, let me know.

Given the pace that GRRM writes, I have been amusing myself coming up with other shows set in the ASOIAF universe that HBO could do once the Dunk &amp; Egg and Robert's Rebellion miniseries were over.

These are my favorites so far, but I want to know what you all can come up with too:

**Rangerman**: In the style of Survivorman, a self-filmed documentary about Benjen's travels North of the Wall.

**Falling Snow**: A buddy-comedy about Ned Stark and Howland Reed taking the baby, Jon Snow, from The Tower of Joy to Starfall. There are plenty of comedic hijinks; in the end they both learn something about what it means to father.

**Real Housewives of Slavers Bay**: Featuring occasional appearances by the Dragon Queen herself.

**Fire and Blood**: A daytime soap opera set in Dorne, during the time of the first Daenerys Targaryen.

**Westeros, A Living History**: Barristan Selmy visits historical sights all around Westeros. With the help of a mummers troupe, he retells the history or each location.

**Wights on Boats**: A Marx-Brothers styled screwball comedy about a couple of Wights stowing away on a slavers ship traveling out of Hardhome.

**Checking Inn**: A travel show hosted by Tyrion and Bronn. They taste the local fair, crack wise at each other's expense and bang chicks in brothels all over the Seven Kingdoms.

1372169860.0,390,self.asoiaf,1h1dr5,(Spoilers All) The strongest evidence for Varys's endgame,CobaltThunder,500,110,394,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1h1dr5/spoilers_all_the_strongest_evidence_for_varyss/,"After several weeks of lurking, finally got round to writing up something to post. Nothing completely new, but just sharing my thoughts over one particular aspect of the Varys/Illyrio = Blackfyres theory.  

There are two schools of thought as to Varys's motivations - I won't go into all the details, but they can be summarised as follows.

1) Varys is acting in the best interests of the 'realm' and the common man of Westeros.

2) Varys is a secret Blackfyre working to put Illyrio's son (also a Blackfyre) on the throne.

I initially didn't like the Blackfyre theory at all, but I'm now convinced it must be true. Not necessarily because of any visions, prophecies or foreshadowing around Young Griff and mummer's dragons, black and red dragons and the rest of it. Namely, because I think there are two known pieces of evidence that completely disprove Varys's stated intentions of purely working for a peaceful and stable Westeros:

* When Rhaegar is planning his great council to deal with his father and possibly the Lords of Westeros are plotting for his removal, Varys helps stoke Aerys's paranoia by convincing him Rhaegar is plotting against him. Presumably Varys has some inkling of any potential plot to depose Aerys and knows Aerys's reaction to learning of such plots will increase the likelihood of open conflict between father and son and decrease the stability of the kingdom. 

* At the end of ADwD, just as the kingdom looks to be regaining some semblance of stability (Tommen is not a psychopath, Kevan is a competent regent, Cersei has been removed from her position of fucking everything up, alliance being cemented with the Tyrell family, end of the war), Varys directly causes instability by killing Kevan to cause the Tyrells and Lannisters to turn on each other. 

That's two chances for a peaceful, stable kingdom that he's blown apart.

Given that Varys is now working to put Young Griff on the throne, the only explanation that makes both of those actions consistent is if he is a Blackfyre loyalist. Why would he destabilise the Targaryens so thoroughly and reduce the chances of Rhaegar becoming king unless he was sowing the seeds for the long game of replacing the Targaryens? How does causing conflict between the Lannisters and Tyrells in King's Landing help the realm? I suspect that if Young Griff is indeed Illyrio's son, Varys has been working to put him on the throne since his birth, or even before as Illyrio would presumably have told him his wife was pregnant.

It's also entirely possible that Varys *also* wants stability and peace, but believes the strongest chance of achieving this is with a ruler that has been groomed from birth to be a good king and is loyal to him. I don't think either Varys or Illyrio would shout about the Blackfyres having 'won' (need to keep Dorne on side etc.) and would be content with the personal knowledge that they have triumphed. Ends justifying the means and all that.

It would be a very GRRM thing to do - subverting the trope of ""guy you can root for because he is working towards a bigger cause"" by revealing that in fact, he is just like the rest of the characters - self interested, trying to improve his family's lot in life and secure a legacy. 

**TL;DR - Varys is a Blackfyre loyalist because he directly contributed to the Targaryen downfall by turning Aerys against Rhaegar, then killed Kevan to create the turmoil that Young Griff can ride in to fix.**",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,ReedOfGreywaterWatch,True,t3_1h1dr5,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1h1dr5/spoilers_all_the_strongest_evidence_for_varyss/,

**Who Are Jon Snow's Parents?**

It's the question all A Song of Ice and Fire readers ask themselves in book one, and never stop asking. The most prevalent theory is that Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, who abducted Eddard's siter Lyanna and the love of Robert Baratheon's life and inadvertently started the rebellion that deposed the Targaryens, had sex with Lyanna –- maybe consensually, maybe not –- and Lyanna died giving birth to Jon. Knowing that Jon would be in considerable danger if his half-Targaryen blood were revealed (remember, Robert was determined to kill every last Targaryen on the planet), he pretended the boy was his own bastard, and took him to Winterfell, telling nobody the truth. Although Ned is incredibly secretive regarding Jon's parentage, he does remember making Lyanna a promise on her death bed, which was likely to keep Jon secret and safe.

Jon's parentage seems likely to most readers – so likely, in fact, that some people believe it's too obvious to be true. Other fans have theorized that Jon is genuinely Ned's child, possibly with some random woman, or possibly with Ashara Dayne, whom Ned was rumored to love. The question is whether Ned's honor is great enough to have precluded him from fathering a bastard — certainly Catelyn and Ned's friends were shocked at the idea Ned had cheated –- and as shown in GoT, Ned is honorable to a fault. So it seems unlikely, although if he did lapse, his shame might be the reason he's so quiet about Jon's parentage. But if his mother is Ashara Dayne or some random wench, that doesn't really explain why he wouldn't at least tell Jon.

Certainly, George R.R. Martin loves his head games, but the idea that Rhaegar and Lyanna are Jon's true parents makes the most narrative sense. And it seems unlikely that Martin would be hinting at the mystery so much only to reveal Jon is just Ned's regular ol' bastard.

**Who Is Azor Ahai?**

Azor Ahai (also commonly called the Prince That Was Promised) is the legendary hero who defeated the Others long, long ago, and is said to come again to fight the Others again, when they return, with his sword Lightbringer. The red priestess Melisandre clearly believes Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai, and wants everyone to know it. However, Melisandre's visions of Azor Ahai don't seem to be nearly as Stannis-oriented as she seems to think, and most readers think if one character fits the bill, it will be Jon Snow, despite –- or perhaps because of –- his current, uh, situation, which would make being ""reborn"" rather… uniquely appropriate.

But it might not just be one character. In The House of the Undying, Daenerys sees a prophecy/vision of Rhaegar naming his son Aegon, claiming he will be the Prince That Was Promised –- but then he also says ""The Dragon shall have three heads."" Could that means Azor Ahai is not one person, but three? That would hint that Daenerys and Jon Snow are two of the Dragon's heads, but then who would be the third? There are two possible answers below. [For more](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai/Theories)

**Might Tyrion Lannister Actually Be a Targaryen?**

We all know ""dragons"" equal ""Targaryens"" in A Song of Ice and Fire. Daenerys is already a Targaryen, and as per above, most people think Jon is, too. So what about Tyrion? Some readers believe that the Mad King Aerys is Tyrion's real father, having forced himself on Tywin's wife Joanna, with Tywin never knowing, or possibly even being a willing pimp. GRRM mentions at one point that Aerys definitely found Joanna attractive. Jon describes Tyrion as having hair so blonde as to be white, which sounds a lot more like Targaryen's hair color than the Lannister blonde; plus, Tyrion has one green eye (very Lannister) and one black eye… and Daenerys' eye color is described as to be so purple it's practically black. Last but not least, Tywin himself tells Tyrion he's ""no son of mine,"" although admittedly, that's immediately after Tyrion shoots him with a crossbow, so perhaps he was just being shitty.

The biggest reason for this theory seems to be Tyrion's prominence in the story, which equals Jon Snow and Daenerys, making them the three primary protagonists. Tyrion being a secret Targaryen would easily explain why GRRM has followed his story so closely, even when he flees King's Landing at the end of A Storm of Swords, and essentially leaves the ""Game"" for quite some time. Besides, the next most obvious Targaryen candidate is Aegon (more on him below), who only showed up in the most recent book, and has had no point-of-view chapters.

On the other hand, someone claiming Aerys found Joanna hot is hardly proof he took her for her own. And Tyrion being a Targaryen would negate all the wonderful issues he's had with his father and Lannister siblings, and that would be an enormous waste.

**What Is Varys' Deal?**

We all know what Littlefinger wants –- power. But what about the eunuch Varys? He does at least as much political maneuvering as Littlefinger, but his intentions are not nearly so clear. He tells the imprisoned Ned that he's trying to help the people of Westeros, which is a situation he definitely didn't need to lie in. But if he's telling the truth, how does he plan to help the people?

Arya hears him plotting with Illyrio Mopatis in GoT, planning for the Targaryen-led Khals to attack while Westeros is already at war., and the possibility of needing to kill Ned. And Illyrio is the one who wed Daenerys with Khal Drogo, theoretically giving Viserys a cavalry of barbarians (we all know ho that worked out, but still). He also helped warn Daenerys that Robert had sent assassins after her. More importantly, Varys is reportedly the person who apparently spirited Prince Rhaegar's infant son Aegon VI out of Westeros to be raised by Illyrio. It seems quite obvious that Varys is a Targaryen supporter, albeit one that realized King Aerys was too mad to rule. The real question is whether Varys truly puts the smallfolk ahead of Targaryen rule –- and if it comes down to Aegon or Daenerys, who would he pick? [for more](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/53705-adwd-spoilers-the-varys-illyrio-conspiracy/)

**Is Aegon VI Real?**

The biggest gamechanger in A Dance with Dragons was the supposed arrival of Aegon, Prince Rhaegar's lost son, who was reportedly killed as a baby by The Mountain (along with all the other Targaryens they could get their hands on) at the end of the Rebellion. It's not at all impossible to believe that someone switched infants before the Mountain's rampage, and spirited Aegon away. Illyrio has spent time and money raising Aegon in secret, educating him to be the best king possible, having him work with the people and experience life as a commoner so he'll be sympathetic to the plight of the smallfolk. If Varys' (and Illyrio's) real goal is to help the people, building a king from the ground up is a pretty smart move.

Certainly, Aegon believes himself to be legitimate. Many ASoIaF fans don't, mostly because 1) they don't believe that GRRM would bring in another Targaryen this late in the game, and 2) they really want Tyrion to be that third head of the dragon. However, Aegon being real makes the most sense. This theory explains all the reasons, but most of all, Daenerys' prophetic dream about Rhaegar saying the dragon has three heads? In it, he names his infant Aegon, and explains the child is one of the heads. It would be an odd thing for a prophetic dream to get wrong. And last but certainly not least. Varys tells the dying Kevan Lannister that Aegon VI is real, and he'd have absolutely no reason to lie to a man seconds from death.

There's a more elaborate theory here, about Aegon -– and possibly Varys –- being Blackfyre, a part of the Targaryen family that split off over 100 years ago, tried to take over the throne, and was outlawed and (supposedly) destroyed. GRRM has been discussing the Blackfyre rebellion in his ""Dunk and Egg"" short stories, but whether that means the Blackfyre line will play a part in the ASoIaF books remains to be seen.

**Was Balon Greyjoy Murdered?**

The king of the Iron Islands is currently Euron Greyjoy, one of the biggest assholes in the entire series (and that's saying something). He gained the throne when King Balon was walking along one of the high bridges that connected the islands rocky spires, when he fell off and died. Shortly after Balon's death, his brother Euron coincidentally arrives even though Balon had exiled him and there's no way he should have been able to know about Balon's death. The leading theory is that Euron, who had been sailing and pirating in the East, hired a Faceless Man to assassinate his brother, making it look like an accident (their specialty). He had the means, the motive and the opportunity. Plus, the old prophet woman known as the Ghost of High Heart says, ""I dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung. On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings."" So most fans believe it's pretty much a lock.

**Is Syrio Forel Alive?**

Everyone wants Syrio Forel, Arya's awesome ""dancing instructor"" from A Game of Thrones, to be alive. That's how awesome he is. In truth, he doesn't die ""on page,"" so to speak — he sends Arya away, and takes on the armed Lannister guards sent to capture Arya with a wooden training sword. It's dire, but Syrio is the First Sword of Braavos, so it's not completely unreasonable to imagine he still beat the guards, and then went on his merry way. But given that Syrio is Braavosi, and Arya's next adult friend is the Braavosi assassin Jaqen H'ghar, who takes an odd interest in Arya and who can also magically change his face, a lot of people think Jaqen might have been Syrio, still watching over his charge. This would indicate a very early interest in Arya by the Faceless Men, the highly skilled league of assassins that Arya has ended up with, but for no known reason. Still, such is the awesomeness of Syrio. [For more](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/32010-syrio-neither-dead-nor-jaqen/)

**What Is Jaqen H'ghar Doing?**

When Jaqen leaves Arya (with the Braavosi coin and the phrase ""valar morghuli,"" which eventually brings her to Braavos and the Faceless Men), that's not the last we see of him. It is undoubtedly Jaqen in the prologue to A Feast for Crows, who –- in the guise of the Alchemist, the face Arya saw him change into –- murders the novice Pate at the Citadel… the same Citadel where Sam Tarly has gone to become a Maester and research the Others… and who meets the same Pate, alive and well. So Jaqen is definitely at the Citadel. Seeing as the Citadel is the most learned place in the world, it seem Jaqen is trying to learn something… or prevent someone else from learning something. The real question is if he's working for someone specific, or on behalf of all the Faceless Men? [For more](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/32010-syrio-neither-dead-nor-jaqen/)

**What Was the Real Reason for Robert's Rebellion?**

There's no real easy way to summarize the amazing fan theory usually referred to as ""Southron Ambitions,"" but the simplest version is that there was a lot more going on in Westeros before Rhaegar kidnapped Lyanna Stark and kickstarted Robert's Rebellion. In fact, Rickard Stark, Ned's father, may have had a grand plan to unite the kingdoms against the Targaryen rule on his own, creating relationships with House Tully Baratheon, Arryn, and even House Lannister in preparation for this war. It all went to hell when Rhaegar stole Lyanna and Aerys burned Rickard and Ned's brother Brandon alive, but seriously, read this admittedly lengthy theory here, and prepare to have your mind blown.

Ever since the death of Kahl Drogo and the birth of her dragons Dany has been been coasting on the promise of power that the dragons will be. What she's gotten she has gotten because of the dragons potential has made people either want to gain her favor or try to trick her so they can take or buy the dragons. 

On that promise of power alone she has accomplished quite a lot. She has raised armies and conquered cities. However I think that in ADWD she began to lose steam. She was ruling a city with nowhere to really go from there. There was an army sieging her. The Meerenese resented her. They did not care about her dragons. They saw them locked up and knew Dany was afraid to set them loose. Dany's ability to milk her dragons for extra favor and control had run out. 

I think her last scene where she is with Drogo and meets the Dothraki is incredibly significant. She has finally ridden her dragon. That scene signifies that Drogo has moved past being a potential power. He now is a great power. The Dothraki will respect that power and therefore Dany. They did not respect her as a Kahlessi before because she was not stronger than them. Sure she had dragons but she couldn't yet ride them. 

""A kahl who cannot ride is no kahl."" 

Now that she can ride her dragons she is the baddest Dothraki out there. She can fill her khalasar with Dothraki warriors. She then can use Drogo and her new warriors to beat off the siege and once again be the badass we know and love. She got so much done with only baby dragons.

1371010228.0,391,self.asoiaf,1g6azq,[Spoilers All] S3E10 completely changed my opinion of Ramsay's portrayal.,FatCatThreePack,467,76,257,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1g6azq/spoilers_all_s3e10_completely_changed_my_opinion/,"Throughout season 3, I felt that the show's portrayal of Ramsay was *off* somehow. I don't have any issue with the show shaping and shifting character's roles a bit - in some cases it makes for an even more compelling character (i.e. Tywin) - but Ramsay seemed unrecognizable and not nearly as impactful.

In the books, Ramsay's defining characteristic was his uncontrollable rage bubbling right beneath the surface. One of the reasons he was so terrifying to read, and the reason why each Reek chapter had so much unbearable tension, was because we never knew when Ramsay would *snap*. Never a theatrical suddenly-furious snap, but the spittle would form around his lips and he would change his mind from rewarding Reek to flaying him. He had a very imposing physical presence, and the almost sexual dominance factor made it extremely unsettling.

For the first 9 episodes of the show, I feel like they focused too much on the playfulness and mind games that Ramsay lieks to play, and not enough on *why* he plays them, and why he enjoys them. The boyish glee and ""acting"" that Ramsay does was definitely creepy, but it never felt right to me. They made him seem too in control of his emotions, almost *too* cunning and smooth... I don't know.

But episode 10's teaching of Reek's name and the way he let his fury go during their ""lesson"" seemed much more like the Ramsay I imagined.

I suppose I'm posting because I'm having trouble articulating what I mean. Maybe it's in part because of how different show Ramsay looks than the description of ugly, fleshy book Ramsay. Thoughts?

**Excerpts of Old Nan's Stories:**

1. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-human children.


2. Old Nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning, and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes.

3. “Oh, my sweet summer child,” Old Nan said quietly, “what do you know of fear? Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods.” 
 
     “You mean the Others,” Bran said querulously. 

      “The Others,” Old Nan agreed. “Thousands and thousands of years ago, a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man. There came a night that lasted a generation, and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels. Women smothered their children rather than see them starve, and cried, and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks.” Her voice and her needles fell silent, and she glanced up at Bran with pale, filmy eyes and asked, “So, child. This is the sort of story you like?” 

     “Well,” Bran said reluctantly, “yes, only  …” 

     Old Nan nodded. “In that darkness, the Others came for the first time,” she said as her needles went click click click. “They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its veins. They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain. All the swords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them. They hunted the maids through frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children.” 
 
     Her voice had dropped very low, almost to a whisper, and Bran found himself leaning forward to listen. 
 
     “Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men, who had taken these lands from the children of the forest. Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch. So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions. For years he searched, until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it. And the Others smelled the hot blood in him, and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds—""

4. In that darkness, the Others came riding, she used to say, dropping her voice lower and lower. Cold and dead they were, and they hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every living creature with hot blood in its veins. Holdfasts and cities and kingdoms of men all fell before them, as they moved south on pale dead horses, leading hosts of the slain. They fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children…

5. “There was a knight once who couldn’t see,” Bran said stubbornly, as Ser Rodrik went on below. “Old Nan told me about him. He had a long staff with blades at both ends and he could spin it in his hands and chop two men at once.” “Symeon Star-Eyes,” Luwin said as he marked numbers in a book. “When he lost his eyes, he put star sapphires in the empty sockets, or so the singers claim.

6. “Old Nan says the children knew the songs of the trees, that they could fly like birds and swim like fish and talk to the animals,” Bran said. “She says that they made music so beautiful that it made you cry like a little baby just to hear it.”

7. Though Old Nan did not think so, and she’d lived longer than any of them. “Dragons,” she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she claimed she could smell it. “It be dragons, boy,” she insisted.


8. “Please.” She remembered a story Old Nan had told once, about a man imprisoned in a dark castle by evil giants. He was very brave and smart and he tricked the giants and escaped . . . but no sooner was he outside the castle than the Others took him, and drank his hot red blood. Now she knew how he must have felt.


9. The nightfires had burned low, and as the east began to lighten the immense mass of Storm’s End emerged like a dream of stone while wisps of pale mist raced across the field, flying from the sun on wings of wind. Morning ghosts, she had heard Old Nan call them once, spirits returning to their graves. And Renly one of them now, gone like his brother Robert, like her own dear Ned.

10. Old Nan told scary stories of beastlings and shapechangers sometimes. In the stories they were always evil. “I’m not like that,” Bran said. “I’m not. It’s only dreams.”

11. “Wildlings come over the Wall or through the mountains, to raid and steal and carry off women. If they catch you, they make your skull into a cup to drink blood, Old Nan used to say. The Night’s Watch isn’t so strong as it was in Brandon’s day or Queen Alysanne’s, so more get through. The places nearest the Wall got raided so much the smallfolk moved south, into the mountains or onto the Umber lands east of the kingsroad. The Greatjon’s people get raided too, but not so much as the people who used to live in the Gift.”

12. “There are abandoned castles along the Wall, I’ve heard,” Jojen answered. “Fortresses built by the Night’s Watch but now left empty. One of them may give us our way through.” The ghost castles, Old Nan had called them.

13. It was the end of the world, Old Nan always said. On the other side were monsters and giants and ghouls, but they could not pass so long as the Wall stood strong.

14. “Some say he was a Bolton,” Old Nan would always end. “Some say a Magnar out of Skagos, some say Umber, Flint, or Norrey. Some would have you think he was a Woodfoot, from them who ruled Bear Island before the ironmen came. He never was. He was a Stark, the brother of the man who brought him down.” She always pinched Bran on the nose then, he would never forget it. “He was a Stark of Winterfell, and who can say? Mayhaps his name was Brandon. Mayhaps he slept in this very bed in this very room.” No, Bran thought, but he walked in this castle, where we’ll sleep tonight. He did not like that notion very much at all. Night’s King was only a man by light of day, Old Nan would always say, but the night was his to rule. And it’s getting dark.


15. “It was not for murder that the gods cursed him,” Old Nan said, “nor for serving the Andal king his son in a pie. A man has a right to vengeance. But he slew a guest beneath his roof, and that the gods cannot forgive.”


16. The sentinels never left the Wall. But there might be other ghosts in the Nightfort, ones even more terrible. He remembered what Old Nan had said of Mad Axe, how he took his boots off and prowled the castle halls barefoot in the dark, with never a sound to tell you where he was except for the drops of blood that fell from his axe and his elbows and the end of his wet red beard. 

    Or maybe it wasn’t Mad Axe at all, maybe it was the thing that came in the night. The ’prentice boys all saw it, Old Nan said, but afterward when they told their Lord Commander every description had been different. And three died within the year, and the fourth went mad, and a hundred years later when the thing had come again, the ’prentice boys were seen shambling along behind it, all in chains. That was only a story, though. He was just scaring himself. There was no thing that comes in the night, Maester Luwin had said so. If there had ever been such a thing, it was gone from the world now, like giants and dragons. It’s nothing, Bran thought.


17. The Titan of Braavos. Old Nan had told them stories of the Titan back in Winterfell. He was a giant as tall as a mountain, and whenever Braavos stood in danger he would wake with fire in his eyes, his rocky limbs grinding and groaning as he waded out into the sea to smash the enemies. “The Braavosi feed him on the juicy pink flesh of little highborn girls,” Nan would end, and Sansa would give a stupid squeak. But Maester Luwin said the Titan was only a statue, and Old Nan’s stories were only stories.

18. Bran found himself remembering the tales Old Nan had told him when he was a babe. Beyond the Wall the monsters live, the giants and the ghouls, the stalking shadows and the dead that walk, she would say, tucking him in beneath his scratchy woolen blanket, but they cannot pass so long as the Wall stands strong and the men of the Night’s Watch are true. So go to sleep, my little Brandon, my baby boy, and dream sweet dreams. There are no monsters here.


19. The monsters cannot pass so long as the Wall stands and the men of the Night’s Watch stay true, that’s what Old Nan used to say.


20. “Do all the birds have singers in them?” “All,” Lord Brynden said. “It was the singers who taught the First Men to send messages by raven… but in those days, the birds would speak the words. The trees remember, but men forget, and so now they write the messages on parchment and tie them round the feet of birds who have never shared their skin.” Old Nan had told him the same story once, Bran remembered, but when he asked Robb if it was true, his brother laughed and asked him if he believed in grumkins too.

21. They rode the winch lift back to the ground. The wind was gusting, cold as the breath of the ice dragon in the tales Old Nan had told when Jon was a boy.

22. The snowfall was light today, a thin scattering of flakes dancing in the air, but the wind was blowing from the east along the Wall, cold as the breath of the ice dragon in the tales Old Nan used to tell.

23. He remembered tales Old Nan had told them of storms that raged for forty days and forty nights, for a year, for ten years…storms that buried castles and cities and whole kingdoms under a hundred feet of snow.

Jon Snow talks about ""kill the boy"" within himself and he works the whole time in ADWD to start to become the man he needs to be, well I think it's his turn to transform.

1364327380.0,390,self.asoiaf,1b27te,(Spoilers All) Ice and Fire: a theory on Lightbringer,Lord_Varys,444,54,160,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1b27te/spoilers_all_ice_and_fire_a_theory_on_lightbringer/,"I am aware of the theories which say Lightbringer is a person (Jon, Dany, etc.); is the Night's Watch; is something other than a sword like Dragons or a Dragon's horn.  

Assuming we will see a sword Lightbringer before the end of the series, I think there is evidence which points to one sword in particular.  I don't have a lot of quotes right now, nor do I have much tinfoil to spare, but I don't think we'll need either.  **My theory is that Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, will be forged by Gendry from Oathkeeper, which was forged by Tywin Lannister from Ice, the ancestral sword of House Stark.**

The thought first came to me after the Hound's trial by combat versus Beric Dondarrion.

In that chapter, Arya sees Beric sitting entwined in a chair/tangle of weirwood roots.  This was seen by me maybe not as foreshadowing of the three eyed crow, but at least as a vivid picture of the Old Gods meeting the New (The Lord of Light, represented by Beric).  He comes from the 'throne' and after some talking the battle begins.  Beric drags the sword along his hand and ignites it with his blood.  Gendry comments that it's not wildfire causing the flame, it's magic.  The battle ends and the sword is broken.

From this scene I gather that a) the magic of the Red God can be used to light a sword ablaze b) the Old Gods and the Red God are not exactly antithetical and c) lesser swords may break from the heat.

But I wonder what would happen if you lit a Valyrian sword ablaze in a similar fashion?  Surely it would not break from the heat, being made of stronger stuff?

Later in the book, we learn that Lord Tywin Lannister has gifts for Joffrey and Jaime.  He has Ice reforged into two twin swords with black and red ripples.  No proof past circumstantial evidence here, but **a Valyrian steel sword is forged for the second time by a Lannister, and now that sword is red.**  [Wasn't there another sword tempered for the second time by a lion?](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer)

Now Gendry.  I don't believe that his character will serve no purpose.  Arya has made plenty of friends, and Robert Baratheon has made plenty of bastards.  Why write Gendry in?  Well, he appears to have as much skill as any smith we know of in the book - sure, he was just an apprentice when we last saw him, but he's by now had plenty of experience with the brotherhood without banners; a brotherhood devoted to the Red God, I'll add; a brotherhood in possession (through Brienne) of this one-of-a-kind red Valyrian steel blade, I will also add.

There are also signs in dreams, including Jaime's dream ([linked here](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/71337-ice-lightbringer/) on the [Forum of Ice and Fire](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/)), and Dany's dream (in ASOS)  of a battle against wights on the Trident.  Dreams point to this region, characters are converging around it, and a sword which is thus far compatible with dreams and ancient prophecy alike is right there in the middle of it.  I think this is enough to warrant the assumption that Ice and Fire will become one in the Red Sword of Heroes, Lightbringer.

*edit: grammar

*edit 2: I will grant that it is very possible Gendry is not involved in the forging of the sword.  Even so, the sword itself still seems to be the one.

Introduction
-

In my first two posts analyzing Robb Stark as a military commander, I painted the picture of Robb Stark as the greatest tactician of the War of the Five Kings. However, the second part of my thesis was that Robb Stark was the worst strategist of the War of the Five Kings. As I reflected on it since the first two posts and upon reading the great replies, I want to amend my initial thesis. Robb Stark was **not** the worst strategist of the War of the Five Kings. Balon Greyjoy has that dubious distinction. 

Rather, Robb was 15 and made teenage decisions on the battlefield and in his long-term goals. I’ll admit that in evaluating Robb as a military strategist, I look at him not from the vantage point of a commander, not a teenager. Even the concept of a teenage wartime leader has a historical basis. One of the more famous examples is [Baldwin IV]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_IV_of_Jerusalem) who defeated Saladin at the Battle of Montgisard at the age of 16. So Robb, as a boy commander, isn’t without some historical parallel. I’ll still argue that Robb’s strategy was poor, but I’ll try to give the boy a little bit of slack.

Unclear and Unconcise: Robb’s Intent
-

&gt; “If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, then the general is to blame. But, if orders are clear and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their oficers.” - Sun Tzu

So while Robb and Brynden were out west defeating untested/untrained Lannister hosts and generally sacking/raiding their way from the Golden Tooth to the Sunset Sea, Edmure Tully, Robb's Uncle, was left to defend the Riverlands. A major point of contention is what instructions Robb and the Blackfish left with Edmure before they departed for their merry campaign. We don't get a POV of the instructions in real-time, but when Robb and his host returned to Riverrun from the Westerlands, they made the following claim.

&gt; ""You were commanded to hold Riverrun, Edmure, no more."" - *ASOS, Chapter 14, Catelyn II*

How clear were those instructions? Let's take a quick look at how the U.S. Army plans their missions via the [Operation Order](http://www.armystudyguide.com/content/army_board_study_guide_topics/training_the_force/the-operation-order-opord.shtml). Now, I won't go into detail and explain how Robb didn't follow the NATO classes of supply or failed to properly account for MOPP-level planning, because that's both ridiculous and entirely unfair. However, I will point your attention to Paragraph III, Execution and specifically to the first sub-paragraph: **Intent** defined as ""A stated vision that defines the purpose of an operation and the end state."" This is an ancient concept, not a modern one. Intent is the key to communicating purpose and end-state to subordinate leaders like Edmure Tully. Was Robb's intent briefed to Edmure? I don't think so.

&gt;  ""Lord Stannis was about to fall upon King's Landing,"" Robb said. ""He might have rid us of Joffrey, the queen and the Imp in one red stroke. Then we might have been able to make a peace.

&gt;Edmure looked from uncle to nephew. **""You never told me.""**

Now, let me ask a simple question. Is the command ""hold Riverrun"" a clear and concise intent? To me, it absolutely is **not.** In his essay, [The Riverrun Decision](http://towerofthehand.com/blog/2013/06/06-riverrun-decision/index.html) Stefan Sasse makes the following statement:

&gt; A lord is sworn to defend all his subjects, and in contrast to some (hi there, Brynden), Edmure takes his oath seriously. He can be no lord if he hides behind the castle walls, a point that is made through the series time and time again, because he would violate his oath and be seen as a coward, which is nothing a lord could stand for if he ever wants to command respect and obedience among his vassals.

This point rings true to me. Lacking a clear, concise intent from his commander, Edmure set about defending Riverrun and the Riverlands when the Lannister host moved from Harrenhal in an attempt to make it to the Westerlands. Edmure and his banner lords met Tywin's host near the Red Fork in a series of engagements known as the Battle of the Fords. And let's give credit to where it's due. Edmure actually turned out to be a pretty decent tactician. Utilizing the wooded terrain to conceal his numbers, Edmure was able to successfully repulse assault after assault by Tywin Lannister and Gregor Clegane. He also utilized his key assets wisely, holding his heavy lance in reserve and placing scorpions and archers at key terrain points to kill enemy soldiers at their most exposed point (crossing the river). The effect was that the Lannisters were thrown back, key Lannister lords were killed and the Riverlands were safe. All was well until Robb and the Blackfish arrived back in Riverrun...

For his actions, Edmure received praise in public and utter damnation in private from his commander when he returned from the Westerlands. The intent all along, you see, was for Tywin and his host to pass through the Riverlands.

&gt; ""We planned to run Lord Tywin a merry chase up and down the coast, then slip behind him to take up a strong defensive position athwart the gold road, at a place my scouts had found where the ground would have been greatly in our favor..."" - *ASOS, Chapter 14, Catelyn II*

Well, that sounds like a pretty decent plan, doesn't it? It almost sounds like **the type of plan you'd probably brief the guy who's supposed to lead your rear detachment so he doesn't, y'know, fuck up your plan by blocking Tywin Lannister's westward advance...**

Final point on Edmure/Robb: It's very possible that the 'merry chase' strategy was one that was thought up by Robb Stark and Brynden Tully to guilt Edmure into marrying one of the Frey girls to re-cement the shattered Frey/Stark alliance. Robb, being 16, had sex with Jeyne Westerling after being wounded at the Crag and then married her out of a sense of duty. But in doing his duty, Robb shattered the alliance with the Freys. Without the Freys, Robb saw no pathway to victory. So the theory is that Robb Stark and Brynden Tully left for the Westerlands without much of a strategy and then retroactively came up with this grand strategy, casting all the blame at Edmure's feet, so as to force him into marrying a daughter of Walder Frey. To me, this is plausible but not wholly convincing. I do think that the merry chase strategy was decided from the outset or fairly early on. I don't think it was communicated **at all** to Edmure. And lest we forget, it wasn't Robb who suggested Edmure's marriage.

&gt; ""We must win back the Freys,"" said Robb. ""With them, we still have some chance of success, however small. Without them, I see no hope. I am willing to give Lord Walder whatever he requires... apologies, honors, lands, gold... there must be *something* that would sooth his pride...""

&gt; ""Not something,"" said Catelyn. ""Some*one*.""

Deadly Friends: Roose Bolton
-

&gt; ""Treason is like diamonds; there is nothing to be made by the small trader."" - Douglas Jerrold

From the start of the northern rebellion, Robb had one key confidant whom he (never should have) trusted: Roose Bolton. Lord of the Dreadfort (even the goddamn name is ominous) and future Warden of the North, Roose Bolton was key to Robb's early strategy of bottling up Tywin Lannister at the Green Fork while he (Robb) moved to relieve the siege of Riverrun. Now, we all know how it turns out, but I want to talk a little about Roose Bolton prior to the Red Wedding, when he turned on Robb and how inattentive senior leadership on Robb's part played a decisive role in letting Roose operate the way he did.

So, when we last left Roose Bolton, he was just east of the Twins having been defeated by Tywin Lannister at the Green Fork. What were his orders at that point? Well first, he was no longer being commanded by Robb Stark. When Robb left for the Westerlands, he fell under Edmure Tully's command. Edmure Tully then ordered Roose Bolton to re-take Harrenhal which he did by bribing Vargo Hoat and the Brave Companions to turn cloak on the Lannisters. 

All was well until Roose Bolton sensed that Robb Stark was losing and then switched sides, right? Maybe. /u/indianthane95 made this point in a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1hibqm/spoilers_all_a_complete_analysis_of_robb_stark_as/caupnx5) from my first post.

&gt; ""I think it stands to reason that Roose sent those Stark-loyalists against Tywin knowing full-well what the likely result was. Due to his lack of morals or misgivings or loyalty, Lord Bolton saw a win-win situation. The one thing he had to make sure of was that he himself didn't get close to any harm, and he did that very successfully, retreating after seeing a full 33% of his host get chopped up.""

Was Roose killing off loyal Stark bannermen in an attempt to position himself for the future? I actually kind of think is plausible. Roose's orders were to block Tywin's advance into the Riverlands so that Robb and his main host could attack Riverrun. Instead, he chose to attack the Lannisters, and wound up defeated, losing a lot of soldiers, but few to none (as /u/indianthane95 points out) of his own Dreadfort men. GRRM, himself, is a [bit opaque](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Roose_Bolton) on the subject itself, though he seems to hint at Bolton's treason from the get-go. 

Besides failures of communicating his intent, one of Robb's other key strategic failures was mis-managing his subordinate leaders. And let's not judge him too harshly, Robb's liege lords both in the Riverlands and the North are **all** (unless I'm misremembering) older than him and most have battlefield experience. Roose Bolton, for instance, served under Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon at the Battle of the Trident. So, it stands to reason that Robb would have little reason not to trust in their ability. And yet, Robb's generals go badly mismanaged. From Edmure in the Riverlands (lack of clear intent) to Roose at Harrenhal, Robb just sort of lets them do their thing. And for a while it works. The Riverlands aren't the focus of Robb's campaign in ACOK. Edmure and Roose's efforts are a sideshow, so Robb doesn't need to really need to manage his subordinates, right?

This is a pretty serious error on Robb's part as we'll see with the Disaster at Duskendale and Roose Bolton. And before we move too much further along, it's worth remembering that Robb told his mother that Roose Bolton scared him. So, there was an element of fear/mistrust that Robb had for the man. And yet, he gave him a wide berth, and by wide berth, I mean the widest. No orders, no commands, no recall for (intentionally) mismanaging the war. These types of decisions that are essential for an Army commander to make were simply *not* made. 

So, picking up the story again, Roose suddenly orders Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart to seize Duskendale , a strategic point located northeast of King's Landing. They are set upon by Randyll Tarly and Gregor Clegane who wipe the Northern host out. We, as readers, are initially led to believe that this was all Robett Glover's doing, but eventually we find out that the disaster was implemented and planned by Roose Bolton, who by this point has fully turned cloak. **Small theory**: in addition to simply putting Glover and Tallhart in a position to die, Roose informed the Lannisters of the location and direction of the attack which allowed Clegan and Tarly to plan the best terrain for their attack and fully rout the northerners. 

After being summoned to the Twins for Edmure's marriage, Roose continues to let loyal Stark bannermen die on the way up while keeping disloyal Dreadfort men away from danger. He accomplished this by slowly moving to the Twins and when they reached the Ruby Ford, he safely evacuated Dreadfort men while leaving 2000 loyal Stark men behind who were set upon by Gregor Clegane.
 
Strokes of Brilliance at the End 
-

&gt; “So long as Theon Greyjoy sits in your father’s seat with your brothers’ blood on his hands, these other foes must wait,” Catelyn told her son. “Your first duty is to defend your own people, win back Winterfell, and hang Theon in a crow’s cage to die slowly. Or else put off that crown for good, Robb, for men will know that you are no king at all.” - *ASOS, Chapter 14, Catelyn II*

A point I didn’t bring up in the previous installments is how impossible Robb’s strategic picture was. Having (foolishly in my opinion) dispatched his closest friend Theon to the Iron Islands to bring the Greyjoys into an alliance, Robb was stunned when the Ironborn launched a full-scale invasion of a weakened north. To top it all off, a further blow came when Robb was told that Winterfell had been put to the torch by the *Ironborn.

But more to the point, Robb was left in an untenable position whereby he was fighting in one place while his kingdom was held by another. On a personal level, I can't imagine the thoughts that would have gone through my head had my homeland been seized while I was in Afghanistan. I can't think of a worse morale-crusher than this for the northern rebels. Robb Stark was a king without a kingdom, and let's face it, the Riverlands weren't a part of the Kingdom of the North originally and served only to broaden the territory Robb was forced to defend. Read more [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1f3le7/spoilers_all_asoiaf_debate_series_2_robbs_choice/). But I digress.

At the start of ASOS, Robb is about to be cornered by 3 armies to his south, east and west. Tywin and the Tyrells are in KL, Gregor Clegane is in Duskendale and a new host is being formed by Devan Lannister in the Westerlands (ASOS, Tyrion III). At this point, Robb finally sees the precariousness of his situation and opts to move back north to retake the north from the Ironborn. In this, we see strokes of tactical brilliance again. Robb's would attack Moat Cailin from two sides and would re-conquer the north, but that was not meant to be. Realizing he needed the Freys again, he attempted to re-secure the alliance through Edmure's marriage. The Red Wedding followed.

One reason is that he has kept Dorne out of the war until now, *and* he has a good heart for both his people and his family (this sets him apart from Littlefinger, who is pretty much the only other ruler whose kingdom so far has been left untouched by war).

Another reason, however, is Doran's strategy in the game of thrones. One thing that is apparent when reading what other people think about the prince of Dorne is that he is invariably described as weak. Especially those close to him, eg. Arianne and the sand snakes, say that he does nothing, he thinks too much, he only delays, he is feeble. In his ADWD chapter, Areo Hotah notes that half the Dornish lords want to go to war and that they think that Doran is weak. Harry Strickland (Golden Company) later notes that Doran is ""scared of his own shadow. Not what you call daring.""

However, this is in stark contrast with what Doran is actually plotting to do. In the Arianne reveal chapter in AFFC:

&gt; I have worked at the downfall of Tywin Lannister since the day they told me of Elia and her children. It was my hope to strip him of all that he held most dear before I killed him, but it would seem his dwarf son has robbed me of that pleasure. I take some small solace in knowing that he died a cruel death at the hands of the monster that he himself begot.

And in ADWD when talking with the sand snakes:

&gt; I am not blind, nor deaf. I know that you all believe me weak, frightened, feeble. Your father knew me better. Oberyn was ever the viper. Deadly, dangerous, unpredictable. No man dared tread on him. I was the grass. Pleasant, complaisant, sweet-smelling, swaying with every breeze. Who fears to walk upon the grass? But it is the grass that hides the viper from his enemies and shelters him until he strikes. Your father and I worked more closely than you know … but now he is gone. The question is, can I trust his daughters to serve me in his place?

The grass comparison makes it clear that Doran only feigns to be an insipid ruler. In AFFC, for example, he tells the kingsguard Arys Oakheart that he thinks he himself is ""frail and failing, and sometimes... Sunspear wearies me, with its noise and dirt and smells. As soon as my duty allows, I mean to return to the Water Gardens."" But this talk of duty is nonsense of course, since Doran has been planning for many years to take revenge on the Lannisters  - a plan which has recently come into its main phase when Tyrion decided to send Myrcella to Dorne and to give the Dornish a seat on the small council. He is already actively executing this plan, which he had so long desired to do, at the moment he has this conversation with Arys. 

So what game does Doran play? He presents himself as a frail prince, so that firstly he hasn't had to involve Dorne in the war so far - giving him the great advantage of having his enemies kill eachother, and having his army (not to mention finances and food stores) still fully intact whereas half of Westeros is now devastated. It's an excuse to not be involved. Secondly, people see that he is doing nothing and think he is not much of a threat whereas he is in secret hatching various schemes and forging alliances wherever they can be found, to further strengthen his position. And now the viper that is Dorne is ready to strike from the grass.

&gt; Sometimes it is best to study a game before you attempt to play it. My brother loved the fight for its own sake, but I only play such games as I can win.

**TL;DR:** Doran intentionally cultivates a picture of himself as a weak ruler, so that he can in secret strengthen his position in the game of thrones.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,Martell,True,t3_1g5bf7,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1g5bf7/spoilers_all_the_game_that_doran_martell_is/,

**V. Knights in Shining Armor**

[The previous post in this series](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dmz7p/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/) demonstrated how Brienne's relationship to Jaime subverts the typical male/female relationship in Westeros. Jaime gave Brienne a sword and a fight instead of roses and kisses. For Brienne, there's much symbolic importance in Jaime's gift of Oathkeeper. It represents a chance for her to redeem herself and Jaime's honor. More importantly, the sword grants her the ability be self-sufficient instead of relying on male gallantry to accomplish her goals ([as most women are forced to do](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dxv4m/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/)). 

Another way their relationship subverts gender roles is that Brienne and Jaime have taken turns playing the rescuing knight and maiden to be rescued. At first, the references to traditional gender roles are mostly ironic:

&gt;Armed men lined both sides of the brook... “Well met, friends,” [Jaime] called to them amiably. “My pardons if I disturbed you. You caught me chastising my wife.”

&gt;“Seemed to me she was doing the chastising.” (ASOS 21/Jaime III)

Later:

&gt;After the second time he fell from the saddle, they bound him tight to Brienne of Tarth and made them share a horse again. One day...they bound them face-to-face. “The lovers,” Shagwell sighed loudly, “and what a lovely sight they are. ‘Twould be cruel to separate the good knight and his lady....Ah, but which one is the knight and which one is the lady?” (ASOS 31/Jaime IV)

And:

&gt;The eyelid was swollen, but Jaime found he could force it open halfway. Qyburn’s face loomed above. “How did you come by this one?” the maester asked.

&gt;“A wench’s gift.”

&gt;“Rough wooing, my lord?”

&gt;“This wench is bigger than me and uglier than you. You’d best see to her as well. She’s still limping on the leg I pricked when we fought.”

&gt;“I will ask after her. What is this woman to you?”

&gt;“My protector.” Jaime had to laugh, no matter how it hurt. (ASOS 31/Jaime IV)

Then Jaime does take on the chivalric role of male protector by preventing Brienne from being raped by the Bloody Mummers (ASOS 31/Jaime IV) and rescuing her from the bear in the pit (ASOS 44/Jaime VI). But what distinguishes Brienne and Jaime's relationship from the knight/maiden trope is that they are essentially equal. They've each in turn assumed the role of rescuer and rescued: Brienne saved Jaime from being recaptured by the Starks. Jaime prevented Brienne from being raped. Brienne kept Jaime's spirits up after he lost his hand. Jaime rescued Brienne from the bear pit. Brienne goes off to redeem Jaime's honor. This basic equality was evident when each (amuthingly) kept trying to protect the other in the bear pit:

&gt;“What are you doing here?”

&gt;“Something stupid. Get behind me.” He circled toward her, putting himself between Brienne and the bear.

&gt;“You get behind. I have the sword.”

&gt;“A sword with no point and no edge. Get behind me!” (ASOS 44/Jaime VI)

Afterwards, Jaime again ironically casts himself as Brienne's hero, but without the nasty edge:

&gt;“Her name is Brienne,” Jaime said. “Brienne, the maid of Tarth. You are still maiden, I hope?”

&gt;Her broad homely face turned red. “Yes.”

&gt;“Oh, good,” Jaime said. “I only rescue maidens.” (ASOS 44/Jaime VI)

There's always been some mockery mixed in with Jaime's 'flirting'. He behaved similarly to Catelyn Stark while he was a prisoner of war. But at a certain point, he starts to actually care about what Brienne thinks of him. Jaime became aroused in the Harrenhal baths when he saw Brienne naked, though he dismisses it as evidence that he's been celibate too long (ASOS 37/Jaime V). He then tells her his greatest secret though he's not sure why (""Why am I telling this absurd ugly child?"" ASOS 37/Jaime V). After he tells Brienne about Aerys's plans to burn down King's Landing with wildfire:

&gt;The wench looked ridiculous, clutching her towel to her meager teats with her thick white legs sticking out beneath. “Has my tale turned you speechless? Come, curse me or kiss me or call me a liar. Something.” (ASOS 37/Jaime V)

After that moment of honesty and intimacy (Jaime bares pretty much everything to Brienne) in the bathhouse, he starts to suppress his urge to be mean to her (ASOS 44/Jaime VI). When Brienne learns about the Red Wedding, ""She looked so miserable that Jaime almost found himself wanting to comfort her."" (ASOS 62/Jaime VII). He even compliments her appearance at one point:

&gt;“Blue is a good color on you, my lady,” Jaime observed. “It goes well with your eyes.” She does have astonishing eyes. (ASOS 72/Jaime IX)

To be clear: this isn't simply a case of 'shipping Brienne and Jaime. I think their changing relationship is significant for their character development. Brienne's growing regard for Jaime, a disgraced knight, echoes her disillusionment with knighthood. Jaime's growing regard for Brienne, a naive idealist, has changed his attitude towards knighthood in a positive direction. 

Just as he used to defend Cersei from rude remarks, he chivalrously defended Brienne from Ser Ronnet:

&gt;Jaime’s golden hand cracked him across the mouth so hard the other knight went stumbling down the steps. His lantern fell and smashed, and the oil spread out, burning. “You are speaking of a highborn lady, ser. Call her by her name. Call her Brienne.” (AFFC 27/Jaime III)

Jaime is so disgusted by Ser Ronnet that he ""charged Red Ronnet with the task of delivering Wylis Manderly to Maidenpool, so he would not need to look on him henceforth"" (AFFC 30/Jaime IV).

Contrast the above to the deterioration of Jaime's feelings toward Cersei. Back at the beginning of their journey, Jaime defended Cersei against Brienne (""'You will be courteous as concerns Cersei, wench,' he warned her"" ASOS 1/Jaime I). But in the Harrenhal baths, Jaime compares her favorably to Cersei ""Brienne caught him before he could fall. Her arm was all gooseflesh...but she was strong, and gentler than he would have thought. Gentler than Cersei,"" (ASOS 37/Jaime V). Unlike Cersei, Jaime can rely on Brienne, who is kinder and more selfless. Their relationship is *far* less one-sided.

-------------------------------------------
**VI. Warrior, Maid, Strangers**

In AFFC, Jaime becomes increasingly disenchanted with his beautiful twin. He's still physically attracted to her, but realizes what a terrible person she is:

&gt;Of late, Cersei always seemed to have a flagon of wine to hand, she who had once scorned Robert Baratheon for his drinking. He misliked that, but these days he seemed to mislike everything his sister did (AFFC 16/Jaime II)

Besides comparing her unflatteringly to King Robert, he also compares her to King Aery when she watches the Tower of the Hand burn:

&gt;The green light of the wildfire had bathed the face of the watchers, so they looked like nothing so much as rotting corpses, a pack of gleeful ghouls, but some of the corpses were prettier than others. Even in the baleful glow, Cersei had been beautiful to look upon (AFFC 16/Jaime II)

And:

&gt;Cersei had never taken kindly to being balked, he knew that. Softer words might have swayed her, yet of late the very sight of her made him angry. (AFFC 27/Jaime III)

Maybe falling out of love with Cersei was inevitable. Jaime's journey with Brienne has changed him so much that even self-absorbed Cersei has noticed:

&gt;""...What did they do to you?”

&gt;“They cut off my hand.”

&gt;“No, it’s more, you’re changed.” (ASOS 62/Jaime VII)

Jaime himself feels like a different man. He's lost everything that made him who he is:

&gt;...Half the court no longer seemed to know him. I am a stranger in my own House. His son was dead, his father had disowned him, and his sister... she had not allowed him to be alone with her once, after that first day in the royal sept where Joffrey lay amongst the candles. (ASOS 67/Jaime)

The cooling of Jaime's relationship with Cersei is connected to the evolution of his relationship to Brienne. Her idealism about knighthood has actually rubbed off on the cynical Jaime--a change that irritates the hell out of Cersei, who is more interested in having a co-conspirator than a hero by her side:

&gt;[Jaime] Once a man puts on that cloak, it changes him.”

&gt;[Cersei] “It certainly changed you, and not for the better.” (AFFC 12/Cersei III)

The twins have become estranged from each other. Remember that Jaime joined the Kingsguard for Cersei, that he tried to kill an innocent child for Cersei. Now he is a stranger to her:

&gt;He was your twin, your shadow, your other half, ...Once, perhap...No longer. He has become a stranger to me. (AFFC 12/Cersei III)

And she has become a stranger to him:

&gt;I thought that I was the Warrior and Cersei was the Maid, but all the time she was the Stranger, hiding her true face from my gaze. (AFFC 30/Jaime IV)

Embracing knighthood has distanced Jaime not only from Cersei, but from his father as well. Jaime rejected Tywin's offer of Casterly Rock and Lady Margarey's hand in marriage. Astonishingly, the notorious oathbreaker and kingslayer asserted the priority of his vows as a knight and Lord Commander of the Kingsguard even over loyalty to his House:

&gt;“I am a knight of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard! And that’s all I mean to be!” (ASOS 62/Jaime VII)

This is a significant change. When Roland Crakehall found Jaime standing over Aerys's body, ""[h]e had not seemed surprised to find Aerys slain; Jaime had been Lord Tywin’s son long before he had been named to the Kingsguard"" (ASOS 11/Jaime II). In AGOT, Jaime thought it was more important to avenge Tyrion than it was to remain at his post as kingsguard. Now Jaime prioritizes his duties as Kingsguard over his family duties. 

Later, Cersei attempts to seduce him in the White Tower and he rebuffs her advances, telling her he won't have sex with her in that particular place (ASOS 72/Jaime IX). This is interesting since he had no problem violating the sanctity of a sept and his own son's wake in order to fuck his sister. Yet he refuses to do the same in the Lord Commander's apartment. Jaime is taking his position as Kingsguard very seriously.

---

**See No Evil - Waymar Royce**

- Figuratively blind to the threat of the Others until it is too late

- Literally blinded when his sword shatters

Relevant quote:

&gt; When the blades touched, the steel shattered. 

&gt; A scream echoed through the forest night, and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces, the shards scattering like a rain of needles. Royce went to his knees, shrieking, and covered his eyes. Blood welled between his fingers. 

**Hear No Evil - Gared**

- Literally lacks ears from frostbite

- As far as we know, Gared never encounters the Others. He flees, presumably because he hears Waymar being slaughtered. In that sense, he does not hear the Others because we know they make no sound when moving. I acknowledge Gared is kind of a tougher fit than the other two.

- You could kind of stretch it and say that Gared dies because Ned is deaf to his warnings. 

Relevant quotes:

&gt; “Can’t you feel it?” Gared asked. “Listen to the darkness.” 

Courtesy of /u/Petycus, who pointed out Ned's comments regarding Gared in Catelyn I are relevant:

&gt; ""The poor man was half mad. Something had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him.""

**Speak No Evil - Will**

- Consciously decides not to warn Waymar when the Others appears and remains silent 

- Strangled to death, rendering him unable to speak.

Relevant quotes:

&gt; Will’s voice abandoned him. He groped for words that did not come. It was not possible.

...

&gt; They emerged silently from the shadows, twins to the first. Three of them … four … five … Ser Waymar may have felt the cold that came with them, but he never saw them, never heard them. Will had to call out. It was his duty. And his death, if he did. He shivered, and hugged the tree, and kept the silence.

Not really much to discuss. I'm pretty sure it's a coincidence, but I thought it was interesting.

Its got a similar ripple/banding effect on the surface AND the method to its production has been lost to time. It's supposed to be shatter resistant and can maintain a sharp resilient edge.

It originated in the 3rd century in India/Sri Lanka where it was manufactured and shipped over to Persia and Middle East (the former being were it got it's name and popularity). Geopolitical upheavals along trade routes are commonly thought to be the reason for its decline in production.

Contemporary attempts at reproduction have been somewhat successful (depending on who you ask of course). One can purchase [novelty Damascus knives](http://www.damascusknifestore.com/index.html) that replicate the look of Damascus Steel, but sadly not it's strength and stiffness properties.

**Technical info ahead**

There are three promising methods to reproducing the steel though:

* The Wadsworth/Sherby method [paper here, paywall warning](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0079642580900146):

This method uses a type of Russian steel called bulat (1.6% Carbon). The bulat is subject to a long heat treatment (15 hours) at a temperature of 1150 °C, to ensure austenitic grain growth. It is then slow cooled (10 °C/hour) to allow carbide/cementite precipitation to occur, which creates the ripples/bands effect on the surface.

* The Moran method:

I can't find any detailed info online on this method but according to this [Washington Post article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/14/AR2006021402058.html) it was developed by William F Moran. He welded three layers of iron and steel together then folded it in on itself, rewelded it and hammered it out (repeating 8 times, building up to 500 layers). Moran founded the American Bladesmith Society. In order to obtain the Master Smith designation within the Society one must make a Damascus Steel blade with at least 300 layers [source, pdf warning](http://www.americanbladesmith.com/uploads/file/Testing/MS%20Test%20FINAL%204-24-2010.pdf)

* The Verhoeven/Pendray method [paper here, paywall warning](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/104458039290115X):

Using wootz steel (1.5% carbon, and authentic ingredient to making Damascus steel), Verhoeven/Perdy initially sought to reproduce the Wadsworth/Sherby method but failed. As a result they sought to develop their own method. They forged the steel in a 7 stage sequence. Each stage consisted of heating the wootz (to temperatures between 1000 °C and 1250 °C), folding the steel in on itself then hammering it out. Each stage was also repeated for a number of cycles (ranging from 5 to 17 cycles). See Table 4 in the referenced paper for the details.

It forces us to realize that this child, who we've pinned all of our hopes on, is not the perfect King we wanted him to be.

If Talisa is a backstabbing spy, the RW would be more about a woman's treachery than a boy's inexperience. It would be more about how good of a backstabber Talisa is than how stupid Robb's decisions were.

Furthermore, it just seems implausible that Tywin would plant some woman in Robb's camp in the off chance that he would fall in love with her.

Rumor has it that Martin makes a cameo in this week's episode, *The Bear and the Maiden Fair*. There's a lot of evidence for this although most of the cast and crew have been very tight lipped about it:

1. It was leaked that Martin made a surprise visit to the set a few months ago.

2. The bear pit scene was filmed in LA, the first scene of the show to ever be shot in the United States. They had to do this because the bear, Bart the Second, is not allowed to leave the country.

3. Martin was in LA around the the time of the filming of that scene.

4. This episode is written by Martin himself.

5. In an interview I can't find right now Martin all but admitted that he'd be showing up on the show sometime this season.

The last sentence had about the impact the RW had when I read it the first time. Thanks, George! Everything about Alyssa, including the ""shed no tear in life"" part is basically Cat's story from here on.

But what if her whole purpose was to die at Jof's hands?  I mean show viewers see that he is a prick, whining about everything and running away when the going gets tough. Easily make him one of the most disliked characters.  But the show needed something to take him from disliked to heartless bastard who should die.

* Roose Bolton ended the pretensions of the traitor boy king Robb Stark in a spectacular fashion.
* ""The man scares me"" - Robb Stark.
* Demolished the army of Northern savages. Where Edmure was shamelessly bullied, Roose was given a pat on the back by Robb Stark.
* Best parent in the Westeros. Understands Ramsay's special needs and doesn't chide or judge him for his amusements. 
* Married a fat girl. Not a fat shamer.
* Makes ample use of leeches to provide employment to lowborns like Chett's father. 
* Cut out the tongue of Ramsay's uncle who slut shamed Ramsay's widowed mother for a little affair. 
* Health conscious. Eats Prunes.
* Hunted wolves in Riverlands to save the people from the maneaters.
*  Restored Winterfell.
* He will kill the cliche main male character.
*  Hopes to restore Theon ""I will kill children so people don't laugh at me"" Greyjoy to his rightful Seastone chair despite Theon being his enemy. Such benevolence!
* Gifted livestock to Ramsay.
* Silences the filthy drunken rapist Greatjon with a look.
* Performed admirably against Tywin without any cavalry. Nearly killed Tyrion.
* Sent the angry Robett Glover to let off some steam near Duskendale. The fool managed to kill all of his men.
* In an act of heartbreaking loyalty to the true king Robert Baratheon, he torched castle Darry which was a den of filthy Targaryen supporters.
* Against overwhelming odds and surrounded by backstabbing faithless northlords, he is trying to save the godswood of Winterfell from Melisandre's fires.
* He is not a man to be undone.
* Tried his best to not  bother Rickard Stark.
* Sent Jaime's message to the boy king.
* Lives near a volcano.
* Took revenge upon the Starks for killing his ancestors despite the godawful plot armour of Starks.
* Wisely counseled his king to slit the traitor false knight Barristan Selmy's throat. You know what they say about knights, if the knight will betray his king for you today, he will betray you for someone. Proving Roose's fears right, Selmy shamelessly turned his cloak before Robert's bones were buried.
* Rejects the hypocrisy of knighthood.
* Employs Steelshanks Walton.
* Took in and cared for his bastard.
* Unlike men like Oberyn Martell who steal children from their mothers after sleeping then slapping them, Roose cares for all women he sleeps with.
* Loves his horses. Still fondly remembers his beloved courser after all these days.
* Married into the family of upstart Freys to shore up alliances for the traitor Robb Stark.
* Sense of humour. Selected 'Rains of Castamere' as one of wedding songs.
* Raised the lowborn Vargo Hoat to lordship.
* Braved the curse of Harrenhal for the boy king.
* Wanted the boy king to judge his own son.
* Doesn't eat people.
* Moved by Cat's motherly anguish over her sons' deaths, ordered Theon flayed and presented Cat a token of vengence.
* Continued employing Reek even though he stank and stole.
* Leeches out his bad blood.
* Blessed by gods.
* Provides his wife with tarts.
* In an act of extraordinary self control that dwarfs a certain Lannister's inhuman and praiseworthy  display of nobility of refusing to rape a crying twelve year old girl, Roose refused to rape two beautiful *adult* women, Dacey and Catelyn.

* Didn't fall in the trap set by Tywin for the greenboy.

* Grudgingly supports his son's love of nudist women.

* Gave his bastard son a personal servant.
* Gave his bastard a ring and finery.
* Gave justice to Rhaenys, Riverlands and Yoren by feeding Amory Lorch to a bear.
* Unlike some of the ""good guys"" and ""heroes"", Roose does not kill children. 
* Rescued Lord Edmure Tully and Lord Walder Frey from Robb Stark who had the mark of beast. Robb turned into a wolf and attacked people at his own uncle's wedding.

 

## A selection of quotes

&gt; His face was clean shaved, smooth skinned, ordinary, not handsome but not quite plain . Though Roose had been in battles, he bore no scars. Though well past forty, he was as yet unwrinkled, with scarce a line to tell of the passage of time. His lips were so thin that when he pressed them together they seem to vanish altogether. 

&gt; There was an agelessness to about him, a stillness; on Roose Bolton’s face, rage and joy looked much the same. All he and Ramsay had in common were their eyes. His eyes are ice. Reek wondered if he ever cried. If so, do the tears feel cold upon his cheeks? 

&gt; Once, a boy called Theon Greyjoy had enjoyed tweaking Bolton as they sat at council with Robb Stark, mocking his soft voice and making japes about leeches. He must have been mad. This is no man to jape with. You had only to look at Bolton to know that he had more cruelty in his pinky toe than all the Freys combined. - An impressed Reek.

*****

&gt; Jaime Lannister sends his regards.

*****

&gt; Roose has no feelings, you see. Those leeches that he loves so well sucked all the passions out of him years ago. He does not love, he does not hate, he does not grieve. This is a game to him, mildly diverting. Some men hunt, some hawk, some tumble dice. Roose plays with men. You and me, these Freys, Lord Manderly, his plump new wife, even his bastard, we are but his playthings. - Lady Dustin.

*****

&gt; Fear is what keeps a man alive in this world of treachery and deceit.

*****

&gt; Bolton's silence was a hundred times more threatening than Vargo Hoat's slobbering malevolence. - Jaime.

*****

&gt; A peaceful land. A quiet people. 

*****

&gt; The lord’s bedchamber was crowded when she entered. Qyburn was in attendance, and dour Walton in his mail shirt and greaves, plus a dozen Freys, all brothers, half-brothers, and cousins. Roose Bolton lay abed, naked. Leeches clung to the inside of his arms and legs and dotted his pallid chest, long translucent things that turned a glistening pink as they fed. Bolton paid them no more mind than he did Arya.

1341359054.0,359,self.asoiaf,w077d,Anyone else think AFFC was massively underrated?,PrivateMajor,461,102,216,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/w077d/anyone_else_think_affc_was_massively_underrated/,"** ***Edit, I forgot...this post has spoilers*** **

A friend of mine warned me that I would not like AFFC, that it was nothing compared to ASOS, and that I was going to be severely disappointed with what I read.  This was the same friend that got me into the books in the first place, so I was understandably worried as I began the read.

Three re-reads later, I still don’t really know what he is talking about.  He, and many…many others will harp on the issue of Dany/Tyrion/Bran remaining absent in the book – but these characters were not the reason that I read ASOIAF.  I read ASOIAF for the level of detail, the character development, the mysteries, the hints, and the political intrigue.  These are thing AFFC has in ample supply.

Even more than the missing chapters from some of their favorite characters, people seem to hate that it focuses on Cersei.  Readers who find her maddening to the point of distraction will not enjoy her chapters, as they are generally filled with Cersei celebrating her intelligence after committing some folly. Subjective opinions of Cersei aside, her chapters are subtly handled; it's easy to cast her aside as a madwoman or an idiot, but GRRM implies throughout it all that the core of Cersei's motivation is fear. She fears for her only son and daughter, she fears for her own safety and the safety of her house, and her throne. The pillars of her world have been pulled from under her: the rock that was Tywin Lannister lies rotting on a bier, and her brother/lover Jaime has changed, in her mind, for the worse. In her inability to cope with events, she mistakes folly for genius, and her actions ultimately seed her own doom.

The other reason people seem to mislike AFFC is Brienne of Tarth. In terms of the number of chapters and page time given, Brienne comes in a close second only to Cersei. So, again, the subjective dislike of Cersei and Brienne have a very significant impact on the opinions of Feast at-large. However, Brienne's story, despite being full of what Jaime calls ""bleating,"" contains the larger portion of action in the entire book. Jaime is forced to fight his battles with wits and words instead of steel, and aside from the Ironmen, the rest of the realm is winding down from the war and fighting grows less frequent. Mileage may vary, but for my money Brienne's quest was a fascinating look at the deplorable state of the seven kingdoms, and there is a brutal grimness to her chapters that suggests that Westeros will get worse before it gets better.

Jaime is at his best in AFFC, hands down. His chapters are more interesting, if less action-focused, than his chapters in ASOS. It is in Feast where Jaime truly begins to change. Tyrion's mocking words at the end of Storm haunt him to the extent of rebuffing his sister, and as her attitude abruptly changes toward him, his own changes toward her as well. His struggle is largely personal, as he has to contend with the demons of his past while at the same time relying on them to keep him alive; the very reputation that he loathes is, right now, the only thing staying the blades of so many people who would see him dead, and House Lannister cast down.

AFFC also features Littlefinger at his best, divulging more of his plans than in any other book, and Sansa's growth from a dreaming woman-child to an intelligent, capable young adult is astonishingly well handled. Samwell Tarly advances the master-plot of the Prince that was Promised and gives a quick look at the developing understanding of events to come, and the focus on the Ironmen, as well as a much-needed look at Dorne rounds out A Feast for Crows as one of the more comprehensive entries in the series, despite the exclusion of Jon, Tyrion and Dany.

I'm still at a loss as to what people expected from Feast; no, it doesn't end in an epic confrontation like at the end of ACOK or ASOS, but the subtle advances of the master plot and the focus on the fallout of the War of Five Kings is just as important in the grand scheme.

Feast is a worthy entry in the series, and well worth re and re-reading, as are all the rest. The subtlety of the writing and characterization, the hints and snapshots we get of the larger events, the development of the characters and the overall tone of loss in this book are not the flashy, quippy, action-packed events of ACOK. Nor are they the epicly brutal events of ASOS. This is a book about the victors licking their wounds, the losers facing their fate, and those who have been left untouched preparing for worse.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1341361678.0,,ManderlyOfWhiteHarbor,True,t3_w077d,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/w077d/anyone_else_think_affc_was_massively_underrated/,

Good morning fellow crows,

By now, you've all either seen [this absurdity](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1be9an/major_spoilers_twow_spoilers_crow_business_super/) or you're just waking up to it too. I hope you're just as upset about this as I am. 

Back in January when they came to us with this promotion, I was excited. A look at TWOW? Who wouldn't want to see that? I've never been against preview chapters being on /r/asoiaf and I actively read them. Not like this. This promotion strikes me as some bullshit corporate public relations effort and *not* a venue through which to get fans excited about The Winds of Winter.

I mean come on. Aren't we ALL already exited for The Winds of Winter? Is there *seriously* anyone out there who can say that they weren't after reading the final chapters in ADWD? So what the fuck is this promotion for then? It's a vehicle for the publishing company to lure new readers in through some bullshit viral campaign simply to increase profits. 

Obviously I'm not against companies making profits. But what I am against is companies using /r/asoiaf to do it. We complain and debate about individual users monetizing /r/asoiaf and yet we don't bat an eye when large corporations do?

This whole post belongs in /r/HailCorporate because the boys were all played for fucking fools. Hell, I think most of them were just excited to be talking to GRRM's people and didn't want to consider the effect of this on /r/asoiaf.

So now here we are. We get to see vague references to these chapters until TWOW actually comes out. Do you think any of the guys who read the chapters wanted to discuss a new spoiler scope for them? Or a policy on what to do about other people repeating the stuff that the mods wrote? Does that violate the NDA? 

The guys rightly assumed I'd be pissed when I woke up and logged on to check in on things as I do every morning. They knew I'd just remove the post and force another discussion on the undecided details if they did it during daylight hours on the east coast. So what did they do? They made sure to post it when they knew I was done for the night. 

Finally, because they seem to have no compunction in taking jabs at me -- and yeah, I've seen them -- I just want to say what a disappointment kendo, PrivateMajor, jmk, TPOG, and rabble have been throughout this entire discussion. I thought we were all rational adults and could talk about things that affect the community. Instead, once the idea of belonging to a special secret club of ""elite moderators"" (so not my words. Guess which mod said *that*.) took hold, trying to have a rational discussion wasn't possible. 

I don't lump dipotassium and gh5 in as they're new hires and couldn't be involved in this process in the first place. (Though the few times they've chimed in on mod mail discussions leads me to believe they'd stand with the guys who've read the chapters.)

So that's it, my fellow crows. I know some of you will enjoy hearing about the TWOW stuff. I hope more of you, however, realize the damage this has done to our community and boycott this entire debacle.

Yours,

Jen_Snow

Sansa Stark        |          Gates of the Moon|Learning the ways of Littlefinger, pretending to be Alayne Stone

Samwell Tarly        |          The Citadel at Oldtown|Starting maester training

So, I know that the chart does not encompass information from the released TWOW chapters, but I figure I'd shade on the cautious side for those who wish to remain completely unspoiled. I also know that I left out a fair number of characters (such as Melisandre, the Tyrells, Brynden Tully, Lady Stoneheart, etc).

I explained that all the dragons are dead and as such, just one of them is worth an unimaginable amount. My friend still unconvinced, I began explaining medieval warfare tactics and how just one dragon can be crucial to break siege, disrupt armies and overall gain supremacy. Also mentioned how the Targaryans first conquered Westeros thanks to these.

My friend, somewhat more convinced, replied: ""Yeah, but wouldn't 8000 soldiers kill a dragon pretty quickly? I mean, the other dragons must have been killed somehow"".

And then I realized that I don't really know how dragons die or how easy it is to kill one. Obviously we haven't seen a dragon die in the books or in novellas, but do characters recall this?

In ACoK, Davos tells Melisandre that he's part good and part bad. Melisandre says ""If half an onion is black with rot, it is a rotten onion.  A man is good, or he is evil.""

Later, in ASOS, Sam is at Craster's Keep, eating some food. He picks up an onion, and  ""One side was black with rot, but he cut that part off with his dagger and ate the good half raw"".

Am I overanalysing a meaningless coincidence, or is there a message in this? What do you make of it?

Here's my interpretation: the reason that Stannis gives for cutting off Davos' fingers before knighting him is that ""the good action does not wash out the bad, nor the bad the good"". Similarly, the fact that part of this onion is rotten does not mean that there is no nourishment in the onion, and the other side still has the potential for acts of good (in this case, feeding a hungry man).

Between that and my last read of DwD, I'm noticing a lot of references in Theon's mind to names. Specifically, the phrase ""you have to remember your name.""

It's obvious why Theon is constantly thinking that-- his time as Reek made him scared of having the wrong name, and his redemption afterward taught him to remember who he was. But that's only periphery to what I'm thinking of.

What struck me about this is actually something I realized about Arya-- they consistently ask her who she is. And she is no one. The whole point of the Faceless Men is to forget your name. And that's what Arya is doing. Yeah, she tucked Needle away where it would be safe, and still has the wolf-dreams. But she's less and less Arya as her training continues. She's forgetting her name.

So, I'm going to pitch my own speculative theory forth for TWOW: 

We know Ser Justin Massey has been sent to hire sellswords in Braavos. We also know Ser Justin is a bit less bold and frontal than most knights. We know that Ramsay Bolton is a monster. And I'm fairly sure Justin knows that. 

My theory-- Arya's return to Westeros will be as an acolyte assigned to kill Ramsay Bolton. Ramsay is someone she does not know, so there's no conflict of interest perceived. When she arrives, she's going to run into Theon Greyjoy, who will recognize Arya Stark, even if nobody else does. And he's going to insist upon the importance of her name. 

This is how Arya Stark gets out of the FM. Because it's inevitable that she does. Arya has the wolf blood. The FM are too calm and rational about death for her. Arya is fire, vengeance, passion. The Faceless Men are no one. 

Arya is forgetting that in Braavos. Who she is, why she's there. She has to remember who she is. She has to remember her name. ",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,RoyceJuniorLine,True,t3_v4to6,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/v4to6/spoilers_all_about_a_name/,

&gt;Speaking of Valyria... right from the start I wanted the Targaryens, and by extension the Valryians from whom they were descended, to be a race apart, with distinctive features that set them apart from the rest of Westeros, and helped explain their obsession with the purity of their blood. To do this, I made a conventional 'high fantasy' choice, and gave them silver-gold hair, purple and violet eyes, fine chiseled aristocratic features. That worked well enough, at least in the books (on the show, less so). 
&gt;
&gt;But in recent years, it has occured to me from time to time that it might have made for an interesting twist if instead I had made the dragonlords of Valyria... and therefore the Targaryens... black. Maybe I could have kept the silver hair too, though... no, that comes too close to 'dark elf' territory, but still... if I'd had dark-skinned dragonlords invade and conquer and dominate a largely white Westeros... though that choice would have brought its own perils. The Targaryens have not all been heroic, after all... some of them have been monsters, madmen, so...
&gt;
&gt;Well, it's all moot. The idea came to me about twenty years too late.

So the theory goes that Illyrio has a Blackfyre wife, Serra, and they have a son. They conspire to convince the world that their son is actually Aegon Targaryen, who is actually dead. They will get Jon Connington and the Golden Company to support this claim because the GC was created to bring the Blackfyres back to Westeros.

What bothers me is: why the hell would Illyrio ever help Viserys or Dany?? They are legitimately targaryens, and have a better claim to the throne. If he were a blackfyre supporter, he would share the same hatred that the other blackfyres have for the Targaryens. And *second*, they would be competition for Fake Aegon in claiming the throne. He would have killed Dany and Viserys immediately and buried them in an unmarked grave. But instead, he supports them for a year and a half? He then arranges the marriage of Dany and one of the most powerful warlords on the continent? And then, he gives her three *priceless* dragon eggs, 3 of the only 4 we know of? **Why??**

I have an alternative theory: Illyrio Mapatis is a religious fanatic, a follower of R'Hllor. I started a re-read recently and noticed that Illyrio blesses Dany with ""the blessings of the lord of light,"" and references it several other times. 

As a follower of the R'Hllor, Illyrio would be well-aware of the prophecised ""Prince that was Promised,"" and that the prophecy requires that the Prince be of the ""blood of the dragon."" So, Illyrio supports the Targaryens, ensuring that the line survives, in order to bring about the fulfillment of the prophecy. This means that he protects Aegon **and** Dany and Viserys, not knowing which one will eventually become (or give birth to) the Prince that was Promised.

In addition, I feel that Illyrio must have a particular red priest in his service, the way Victarion has Mqorro and Stannis has Melisandre. This red priest foresees the future for Illyrio. This has led to great business success for him, and this is how Varys knows some of the best-kept secrets. There aren't 'little birds' gathering them; the red priest is able to see it like Melisandre can. This red priest foresaw that Dany would hatch dragons from the eggs, which is why Illyrio gathered them and gave them to her. 

**Tl;Dr** Illyrio Mapatis is a believer in R'Hllor and the prophecy of the Prince that was Promised, so he supports all Targaryens to bring that about. ",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,Tawney,True,t3_1ic7xm,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1ic7xm/spoilers_all_magister_illyrios_motives/,

Hi, I'm fortunatemend from the WesterosCraft project. We usually showcase our builds in /r/minecraft, but I'm not sure if we've shown our work here in /r/gameofthrones yet. Basically, we're building the continent in Minecraft for it to be a role-play map, and after that, Essos! 

The builds in order are Winterfell, Castle Black, Dragonstone, Pyke, Moat Cailin, the Eyrie, Casterly Rock, Harrenhal, and Lannisport. We always research from the books to provide as much detail and accuracy as possible, and for our builds, we look at art history, architectural history, social history, and other concept art / art direction (including HBO's) to compare ideas. 

We have *lots* of other locations in the ASoIaF universe as well, so feel free to come in and explore the server at mc.westeroscraft.com if you have the game - you get to warp and fly around so you can see everything better!

I figured that the work might transcend its Minecrafty-ness for you guys and you'd appreciate the chance to walk freely through a visualized environment of the books you've loved reading and the episodes you've loved watching. Hopefully you guys like it!

Our website is www.westeroscraft.com and full-resolution wallpaper images are available in [this thread](http://mc.westeroscraft.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=1084) on our forums.

I understand the fundamentally literary quality of ASoIaF and don't mean to make spam or whatever; I figured you might enjoy the chance to explore the world your minds have already been simmering for so long.

**EDIT:** I'm sorry! The server IP is mc.westeroscraft.com, come visit!

**EDIT 2** Lots of you guys in this post have said you've bought Minecraft just to see the server. We really appreciate having as loyal and attentive a userbase as there is in /r/asoiaf on our server, and it's been a pleasure talking to all of you that have been coming on! Hopefully in the next few days, the Reddit rush will die down, and you'll be free to explore without all the craziness. Thanks for your patience so far.

In the story he sets out with a dozen companions, and his dog,  but one by one each one of them dies. 

&gt;For years he searched, until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it. And the Others smelled the hot blood in him, and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders as big as hounds-

Unfortunately she is cut off by Maester Luwin before we can hear the end, but my theory is that the hero from Old Nan's story is Coldhands. I'm not sure what happened that allowed him to unlive for so long without being under the Others' influence, but perhaps the Children of the Forest were able to save him some how. This would explain why he seems aligned with the CotF, and satisfies the requirement of dying a long time ago.

Sorry if this theory has been presented, and picked apart, but I've never heard of it.

Thoughts?

EDIT: Well it seems like a lot of you like this theory, but a few of you have poked holes in.

But I am missing one view of it. Everyone seems to be focused on finding evidence for the theory and sometimes speculating in what this will mean for the future in the books. This nitpicking of trying to find words and sentences that could be interpreted becomes pretty boring and turns an amazing story into a hunt for trivia and loses the focus on the story. 


I would like to propose a more poetic view of it. I believe the entire ""Song of Ice and Fire"" is a metaphor for the love between Rhaegar and Lyanna. It might become a fight of survival between Others and dragons later, but the basis for the story is the love that were so impossible that it cause not one, but several civil wars for years. Romeo and Juliet cause a lot of death, and GRRM would probably find a way to bring in elements from old epic stories into his own story and supercharge them like he did with all the other old tales we can find traces of in the books.


One of the main strong arguments in the theory of R+L=J is that it bring the one strange and uncharacteristic move from Eddard and not only explains it, but it fits so well that its arguable the situation that best shows the personality of Eddard.


On top of this it fits with the described personalities of Lyanna and Rhaegar too. Lyanna is the rebellious one and would never back down if she wanted Rhaegar. And Rhaegar, the warrior with a lovers heart, would definitely go for the love, and then bravely fight everything the world would throw at him just to protect it.  


And its here that I think the poetic parts of the story comes alive. Wouldnt it just be amazing that the entire Song of Ice and Fire is about two people who arent even a part of the story? I think this creates a depth thats just awe inspiring when you think of that the main characters are only featured as tales or a statue in the background.


On top of this it creates an amazing situation for when Daenerys and Jon meet. The horrible life that Daenerys had to experience with begging and being shunned her entire life is caused, not by hate, greed, violence and power that is so prominent in the story, but by love between two (and this is rare in GRRMs books) good people. Jon, the outsider and bastard, is at the same time the most high born of them all, also a twist typical for GRRM.


I am looking forward to the scene when the J and D finally meet. I believe Daenerys will first pour all her anger and hate she nurtured during her childhood over Jon as she tries to get back at the so hated Usurper and killers of her family. Then she (or in sad way, maybe only we, the readers) will discover that he isnt a symbol for the treachery between the families, but a symbol for the love between Stark and Targaryen that could exist, even under the threat of war.


As GRRM said, the story might end with just death for everyone. If this is the case I would like to think that in some way, the bones of Lyanna would be joined by Rhaegars in the end. But a lot of possible endings can end it in a beautiful way. Maybe Jon and Daenerys will be that love they felt reincarnated? Or destiny will once again tear them from each other. Maybe love will overcome all this hate and violence thats everywhere in the story, and show that love can exists even in a world of hate. Maybe everyone will die in the end in an unhappy ending while we readers scream at the characters to stop being stupid and embrace the huge potential for good thats just an abstract dream of love (or spring?) in the background of the story.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,,True,t3_1e4oci,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1e4oci/spoilers_all_the_real_beauty_of_the_rl_theory/,

1361017271.0,346,self.asoiaf,18mvd4,(Spoilers ADWD) A Certain Stark Analysis &amp; Speculation.,InflatableNipples,387,41,147,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/18mvd4/spoilers_adwd_a_certain_stark_analysis_speculation/,"As a character that has seen almost minimal “screen time” per se, the cloud of mystery surrounding Benjen Stark has sparked much and more debate across ASOIAF boards and forums alike. Benjen’s unexplained disappearance would not be nearly as heavily questioned had he been born of any other name, but alas us readers love us some Starks and here I am attempting to piece together the puzzle of what logically could have happened to him without making too many random jumps out of convenience.


I won’t go into too much detail about Benjen before his final ranging, as his history is often nothing more than speculation as to why he joined the Night’s Watch in the first place. Many theorise it was out of grief for the death of Lyanna, others suggest it was out of honor as he was not the heir to Winterfell with Robb born and crazier still some have concocted a notion that he knew the true nature of Jon’s parentage long before the war began and took the black out of shame for what transpired. Regardless of his reasons, he was sworn in as a brother and soon after became the First Ranger, a title that makes him well known amongst the wildings. And thus we arrive at the beginning of ASOIAF.


In the prologue of A Game of Thrones, Ser Waymar Royce leads a wilding tracking ranging that goes awry when then come face to face with the Others in which Royce and Will are slain and Gared flees to be executed as a deserter. As First Ranger, Benjen’s responsibility is to search for them when they do not return. We hear of this once Jon arrives at the Wall.


&gt;**Three days after their arrival, Jon had heard that Benjen Stark was to lead a half-dozen men on a ranging into the haunted forest.**
&gt;
&gt;*JON, AGOT*

From this statement we can assume Benjen’s ranging party itself consisted of approximately five or six men. We learn the fate of two of these party members when Ghost finds Othor and Flowers in the Haunted forest when Jon and Sam swear their oath. We can safely ascertain that they were both from Benjen’s party:

&gt;**“It has been close on half a year since Benjen left us, my lord,” Ser Jaremy went on. 
&gt;“The forest is vast. The wildlings might have fallen on him anywhere. I’d wager these two [Othor &amp; Flowers] were the last survivors of his party, on their way back to us... but the enemy caught them before they could reach the safety of the Wall.""**
&gt;
&gt;*JON, AGOT*

This is further proven by Jon’s recollection of Othor:

&gt;**Jon remembered Othor; he had been the one bellowing the bawdy song as the rangers rode out.**
&gt;
&gt;*JON, AGOT*

This makes up three of an estimated five or six man ranging party. So what happened to the other members that went out with Benjen, Othor &amp; Flowers? It is safe to assume from now that Benjen’s party encountered the Others in the haunted forest. As only two bodies were found dead (Othor and Flowers), we can also assume that the remaining party members survived the initial attack. Due to the nature of many of the Night’s Watchmen being robbers, rapists &amp; murderers, it shouldn’t be hard to believe that upon seeing their comrades attempt to slay the white walkers go without success and in turn leading to their deaths, they should flee with their life. It wouldn’t be the first time they have made that decision, for that’s probably how they got to the Night’s Watch in the first place – a decision between life of service, but a life nonetheless; or a certain heroic death. 

So which Night’s Watchmen can we recall that were once rangers that have fleed North of the Wall in that time frame? Oh yeah, our good ol’ Stark robbing friends Stiv and Wallen. If you’ve forgotten these minor characters, along with a couple of wilding spearwives, were involved in the attempted robbery of Bran Stark south of the wall near Winterfell. As far as timings go, as we do not specifically hear of any additional patrols or rangings occurring besides Royce’s party which we definitely know who was involved and how it ended up, Stiv and Wallen being part of Benjen’s party is not too great a leap of faith to believe. Stiv’s familiarity with Benjen when encountering Bran further suggests he knew him well enough that it’s likely he was from Castle Black.

&gt;**The gaunt man [Stiv] with the grey stubbled face laughed. “The boy’s a Stark, true enough. Only a Stark would be fool enough to threaten where smarter men would beg.”** 
&gt;
&gt;*BRAN, AGOT.*

Stiv further provides evidence that he was part of Benjen’s party by his knowledge of the Others aka the white walkers.

&gt;**“You want to go back there, Osha? More fool you. Think the white walkers will care if you have a hostage?” He turned back to Bran and slashed at the strap around his thigh.**
&gt;
&gt;*BRAN, AGOT.*

Since at this stage there have been no other rangers that have come into contact with the Others, it is safe to assume these two were once part of Benjen’s failed ranging.

So if Benjen’s body wasn’t found with Othor and Flowers, and hadn’t deserted with Stiv and Wallen, what really happened in that small battle in the haunted forest? Was he taken captive by the Others and may come into the story later in league with the Great Other? Possible, however unlikely I believe that ending may be, GRRM always finds a way to shock us.

Before I continue we need a better understanding of where exactly Benjen’s party encountered the Others. Craster’s memory aids that problem. 

&gt;**“I’ve not seen Benjen Stark for three years,” he was telling Mormont. “And if truth be told, I never once missed him.” A half-dozen black puppies and the odd pig or two skulked among the benches, while women in ragged deerskins passed horns of beer, stirred the fire, and chopped carrots and onions into a kettle. 
&gt;“He ought to have passed here last year,” said Thoren Smallwood. A dog came sniffing round his leg. He kicked it and sent it off yipping. 
&gt;Lord Mormont said, “Ben was searching for Ser Waymar Royce, who’d vanished with Gared and young Will.” 
&gt;“Aye, those three I recall. The lordling no older than one of these pups.”**
&gt;
&gt;*JON, AGOT.*

So Benjen didn’t make it quite as far north or west as Craster’s Keep or he surely would have sought shelter, albeit begrudgingly. Therefore it is only logical that his party instead searched north-east of Castle Black, most likely in the direction of Hardhome. 

Back to Benjen’s fate. Benjen was an adept swordsman, had a great understanding of the forest and from what we can gather about his personality, has always acted in a way that signifies honour and benefits the watch. He neither fleed south, nor died. From an earlier reference, Stiv said “The boy’s a Stark, true enough. Only a Stark would be fool enough to threaten where smarter men would beg.” Which may or may not be a direct reference to Benjen’s encounter and reaction to the Others. So I don’t think he was captured either. Could he have scared them off with fire after everyone else was dead or had fled? Did he figure out a way to escape, in the hope of returning to the Wall to let everyone know of the situation at hand? My gut tells me yes, should some miracle occur in which he did survive, his first priority after escaping would be to warn the Watch.

Going back to what I said before, Benjen was renowned for his knowledge of the haunted forest. If the Others had returned west, perhaps Benjen’s first thought would be to continue east and attempt to catch passage back to Eastwatch-by-the-sea. The best place to do this would be Hardhome. 

&gt;**Jon had a map before him on the table. He turned it so they could see. 
&gt;“Hardhome sits on a sheltered bay and has a natural harbor deep enough for the biggest ships afloat. Wood and stone are plentiful near there. The waters teem with fish, and there are colonies of seals and sea cows close at hand.”**
&gt;
&gt;*JON, ADWD.*

If Jon has knowledge of this, it is more than likely that a seasoned ranger such as Benjen would have this exact knowledge if not a better understanding of Hardhome. Benjen’s decision to seek passage by boat from Hardhome would also be the quickest way of travel.

&gt;**The fastest way to Hardhome was along the coast … from Eastwatch. The woods were thinner near the sea, the terrain mostly flatlands, rolling hills, and salt marshes. And when the autumn storms came howling, the coast got sleet and hail and freezing rain rather than snow.**
&gt;
&gt;*JON, ADWD.*

Assuming Benjen was able to make it Hardhome in one piece which I very much believe he would be able to do even alone, he has the means to stay alive by the abundant presence of fish, seals and sea cows. The next progression could occur in two possible ways, either Benjen found passage on a trade galley venturing further north than intended, or spent enough time to build his own ship (Benjen the Builder, eh?). He certainly had enough wood and stone to do so and may have found the necessary building equipment in the ruins of Hardhome. 

Moving forward, so once this has happened, why hasn’t Cotter Pyke seen Benjen arriving on the shores any time throughout the series? It would be a shame if he crashed, being so close to surviving an Others ambush and battling the increasingly bad weather alone in order to let the realm know of its impending doom. We would have heard about that kind of wreckage from Cotter Pyke at some stage over his constant voyages along the coastline right? Right…?

Oh wait, we did. 

&gt;**If he does return. Jon feared for Sam and Maester Aemon. Cotter Pyke had written from Eastwatch to report that the Storm Crow had sighted the wreckage of a galley along the coast of Skagos.
&gt;Whether the broken ship was Blackbird, one of Stannis Baratheon’s sellsails, or some passing trader, the crew of the Storm Crow had not been able to discern.**
&gt;
&gt;*JON, ADWD*

This would mean that Benjen is now stranded on Skagos amidst a bunch of cannibal wildings and unicorns, which may explain why he has not yet returned to Eastwatch-by-the-sea. If he survives that, looks like he’s in for a big motherflippin’ surprise when his nephew Rickon rocks up with Osha. I do wonder how these three would react once Davos joins the party and tells them what’s been going on in Winterfell. Will Benjen finally cast down his vows to help his family? Or will he return to the Night’s Watch to find his other nephew has just been murdered by his “brothers”. Either way, I reckon shits going down and Benjen’s going to be a big part of it.

TL;DR: Benjen is just Benjen, he’s been through a hell of a fucking lot.

1356511013.0,353,self.asoiaf,15glpt,(Spoilers All) A mundane take on Jon's fate,int3rcept,453,100,158,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/15glpt/spoilers_all_a_mundane_take_on_jons_fate/,"Just so my own theory of Jon's fate is out here, I'm making a thread about it. I'll be addressing the popular objections below but basically here's what I think: Jon is alive and badly wounded but not in critical condition. This would eliminate the need for Melisandre to revive him through supernatural means and I believe he will heal naturally.

Wun Wun did a number on all the conspirators before the fourth dagger could finish Jon off, perhaps assisted by the wildlings and loyalist black brothers. He might be believed dead and most likely stripped of his command, placed either in prison or in some safe place elsewhere on the Wall. He did not warg into Ghost during his ""death"". 

While he is bedridden, his wolf dreams grow more intense and frequent, eventually catching the attention of Borroq or Melisandre who assist him in develop his warging potential. This is when we'll see the next stage of Jon's development. First we saw him becoming skillful in battle, then command, and now the realm of the supernatural. It's a classic example of [the monomyth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth). It's also consistent with the warging development of Arya and Bran. Bran's greenseer powers begin manifesting after he's crippled and Arya learns to skinchange on command after going blind. Jon's possible training in warging while abed would fit the theme of the spirit developing only when the flesh has been taken away.

Now, on to the three claims:

1. Jon is dead and gone
2. Jon is ""dead"" but lives on through warging into Ghost
3. Jon is dead and will be resurrected through Melisandre


**The prologue featuring Varamyr pretty much confirms that Jon warged into Ghost.**

No, it does not. None of the prologues exist to push the characterization of only one or two characters. That would go against the entire spirit of GRRM's writing format. He writes from multiple POVs to show that all their stories are more or less equally important. Who you deem to be important is who you like the most. The purpose of the prologues are to reveal general themes or foreshadow the entire novel itself, not develop specific characters.

**Game of Thrones:** The Others and the wights are real despite the vast majority of people in Westeros believing they are simply myths. If we didn't have this prologue, we would have assumed the beliefs of most characters in ASOIAF who think that the Others and the Children of the Forest are nothing but myths.

**A Clash of Kings:** Magic is real and it works. This prologue serves the same purpose as the previous novel's, letting the readers know that magic is real and it can be invoked by will, though it is not always reliable. 

**Storm of Swords:** The Night's Watch is at its lowest point in history, the lords of the realm are oblivious to the true threat, and the Others are approaching. Some people claim that this foreshadowed the death of Jorah Mormont because it specifically spoke about the conspiracy against him. I believe it is moot because the Bear was a capable leader -- the intent is to show that the Night's Watch is doomed no matter who's leading it because it has forgotten its original mission and most of the people in it are either criminals or desperate runaways. Serving in the Watch is no longer seen as a noble sacrifice but rather a penal sentence. This could also be a slight foreshadowing that the Wall itself will eventually fall.

**A Feast for Crows:**  There is a strange conspiracy afoot. The Citadel has had a hand wiping out all the dragons in the world and the dragons are tied somehow to the existence of magic. As readers we're supposed to be curious what Jaqen is doing at the Citadel, but the real question it should lead us to is what interest do the Faceless Men have with the maesters? Jaqen is not there to kill anyone. He's there to get a book. A very unusual contract indeed for a monastic order of assassins.

**A Dance of Dragons:**  Human warging is possible and there is life after death. That's a nice lore bonus but the key thing to remember here is where Varamyr died. He died fairly close to the Wall when he sees the wights. This is a set up for Winds of Winter. The Others have nearly reached the Wall and the realm is thrown into yet another civil war with the Second Aegon's Landing.

I mean if you had to jiujitsu Varamyr's scene into relating to warging somehow then why not Bran who actually does warg into a human being? Or Arya who used it on command to skinchange into a cat and identify the Kindly Man? What compelling evidence is there that this POV *must* be about Jon when his wolf dreams are not even growing more frequent or more intense? Just because he got stabbed?

**Melisandre sees visions of Jon turning from a man, a wolf, and back to a man again. So far we've seen that prophecies and visions in the series are very reliable.**

It's weird to me that the simplest interpretation of this dream is never entertained. Those visions could just represent Jon's current wolf dreams. He's a man while awake, a wolf while dreaming, and a man again when awake.

**What about the introduction of Borroq?**

As another poster pointed out in a different thread, I believe he was introduced as a red herring. The foreshadowing that Jon was running into danger was obvious. Ghost was going nuts prior to Jon's fateful meeting in the courtyard just like Grey Wind was going nuts when Robb approached the Frey camps for his wedding. Jon attributed Ghost's hostility to the presence of Borroq's boar.

Borroq threw most readers off the scent, pun unintended, but I also think that he might play a bigger role if my theory turns out to be correct and he decides to train Jon.

**But Jon was stabbed fatally!**

He wasn't. He was stabbed once in the gut, once in the shoulder, and grazed around the neck and collarbone. The gut wound is pretty serious, possibly life threatening if not treated in time, but the other two are pretty minor. It is very common for healthy people to survive stabbings like this especially with the level of medical knowledge in ASOIAF. There are many potential candidates that could nurse Jon back to health -- black brothers with basic medical training, wildling folk healers, and maybe even maesters that came with Queen Selyse.

As mentioned before, this would naturally discount the need for Rh'llor healing since Jon wouldn't be dead or in critical condition.

**Ah, but what about the ""fourth knife"" he never felt? And later he ""only felt the cold""?**

Perhaps he never felt it because the fourth knife never actually landed. Remember that in the same scene, Wun Wun was using Ser Patrek as a human mace and mauling everyone in sight. The giant could have easily beaten the piss out of the conspirators by that time before they could land a fatal blow. There were also wildlings present. Are we to believe that they would stand there and let Jon die? The man who vouched for their safe passage through the Wall and integration into the Night's Watch, much to the ire of his own sworn brothers? It wouldn't exactly be difficult to save Jon during the chaos.

And consider how many ""fake"" deaths there were in the series. Jon Connington drinking himself to death, Theon being tortured to death at the Dreadfort, Bran and Rickon being beheaded, Brienne being lynched... One of Arya's chapters ended with ""The Hound's axe took her in the back of the head"", yet clearly she's alive and her noggin isn't cleaved in half. The meticulous, accurate prose GRRM used to specify the manner in which Jon was stabbed mixed with the cryptic prose describing the fourth knife leads me to believe the final stab never came. The cold could be Jon going into shock, a common response in stab victims.

And finally, GRRM is reluctant to confirm Jon's death. Here's the [Entertainment Weekly interview of him again](http://shelf-life.ew.com/2011/07/21/dance-with-dragons-shocking-twist-g/):

&gt; **ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY:** So why did you kill Jon Snow?

&gt;**GEORGE R.R. MARTIN:** Oh, you think he’s dead, do you?

&gt;**ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY:** Well, I guess. Yes. That’s how I took it. The way it was written, it sounded like he was mortally wounded — and, you know, it’s you!

&gt; **GEORGE R.R. MARTIN:** Well. I’m not going to address whether he’s dead or not. But as to why — didn’t you think the text established why they would want to assassinate him?

He was also famously dodgy about Aegon's death while simultaneously confirming his sister Rhaenys' death. Well now after Book 5 we know why. Of course there are theories that Aegon actually is dead but that's been discussed in other threads. The point is that near death scenes are a common motif in the series. In line with GRRM's closing statements about Jon's ""death"", I think the important thing is not to debate whether Jon is dead or not, but to discuss the literary significance of why he was killed, what purpose it serves in the narrative, and what purpose it serves for the future of the character.


**Well I still think that Jon will live on as a warg in Ghost.**

Given all the points I presented above and the vast unlikelihood of it, why? Is there any strong anecdotal evidence of it at all? Does all the evidence actually add up and come together?

There must be *some* indication in Jon's own development for something like this to happen. He never consciously controls his powers. He doesn't receive more wolf dreams. He doesn't receive more intense wolf dreams. There's just no foreshadowing of it in his own character, that he is becoming someone capable of warging into his companion at will.

I don't think the prologue can make a case for it because of (1) how people are interpreting it is extremely narrow given that there are other wargs *in the same book* with more skill and talent at it than Jon and (2) no prologue in the previous books has been used to serve the development of just a few characters.

I have a theory of why people want to believe in the Jon=Ghost theory so strongly. A lot of people unintentionally read ASOIAF like a conventional fantasy series, meaning that they elevate the importance of certain characters because the typical fantasy novel has 2-3 superheroes guiding most of the plotlines. The purposes of ASOIAF's POV format are to have separate plot threads occurring at different parts of the world in one timeline, introduce unreliable narrators and thus moral ambiguity, and to eliminate the trope of ""main"" characters. Everybody is doing important things or on the way to doing important things. They're just doing it all in different places. It's bad writing to use a prologue to push the agenda of only 2-3 characters of a book filled with half a dozen POVs. GRRM very clearly doesn't do this with his prologues but Jon is understandably a fan favorite so he gets elevated in the eyes of many readers.

Truthfully, Jon is my favorite character but he's just one of many important characters. To say that the prologue exists solely to foreshadow his storyline is not what GRRM is trying to do and discounts the importance of all the other POVs.

**What about when Jon yelled out for Ghost in his final moments? It's a parallel to when Varamyr's last thought was of his wolf One Eye as he tried to warg into him for his Second Life.**

Jon whispered for Ghost, not yelled out for him. I've seen a lot of people claim that Jon yelled for him but the text specifically says he whispered.

As for Varamyr, he searched for any one of his wolves to warg into. When he couldn't find them in time he died for good and he *saw* One Eye as a wraith/specter/whatever he became.

If Jon actually warged into Ghost, why isn't there a similar process? It's Jon's POV after all. Why don't we see Jon's thoughts as he searches frantically for Ghost? In actuality his final thoughts are actually for Arya before the ""cold"" takes him, pulling out the dagger inside of his gut and thinking ""Stick them with the pointy end"".

Why did Jon whisper ""Ghost""? Because Jon realized that Ghost wasn't actually edgy about Borroq's boar. Ghost was trying to warn him. This is actually a parallel to Robb's final moments at the Red Wedding. Both Catelyn and Robb hear Grey Wind howling when the Red Wedding is nearly finished. Robb also whispered the name of his direwolf. Is this compelling evidence that Robb was unconsciously warging into Grey Wind? Of course not. He simply realized the real reason why Grey Wind was so acting so unruly before entering the camp.

Joffrey is in the fifth or sixth hell, and Ned is rolling over in his grave at how badly he fucked up.

But the war isn't over.

Daenerys Targaryen stands against Khal Jhaqo and hopes to cross the Narrow Sea this century. Littlefinger is setting up Sansa to inherit Robb's crown, while certain events may be aligning to give Jon that same opportunity. Stannis still lives, although he'll be fighting in a different part of Westeros in this part of the war. A (younger) boy sits on the Iron Throne surrounded by dying lions and the thorns of roses. Asha and Victarion both have plots to dethrone Euron, while a dead baby has landed and set his sights on Storm's End.

So, in the War of Five Kings (Monarchs if you want to include the gals in on this one) Part 2, who will win and who will die? Who will sit the Iron Throne, the Seastone Chair, and whatever other thrones out there? Here's my official analysis and prediction.

---

First, let's get to know the players--all of them, not just our kings and queens.

**King Stannis** is poised to have the loyalty of much of the North, although that loyalty is through loyalty to Ned and Robb. The Mountain Clans ride with him to save ""Arya,"" and White Harbor will declare if Robb's heir can be found. But if Sansa or another Stark (Jon, if some theories are true) is crowned as the King/Queen in the North, I don't think Stannis will keep their loyalty. He has Karhold, and a sort-of alliance with the wildlings, although the first is weak and the second is up in the air with Jon's death. He's strong now, but that strength doesn't look likely to last.

Of course, how can we talk of Stannis and not the other claimants to the North?

**Jon Snow** is probably the biggest wild card in the whole series right now. He could be living or dead. He might be in Ghost's skin, or he could be getting a particularly warm kiss from Melissandre in a bit. But if he lives, we have a few possibilities:

* He will be legitimized by Robb's decry, thereby making him King in the North. In all likelihood, most northern lords would flock to him, while the Riverlords might be torn. While he is Robb's heir, he doesn't share the Tully blood that made Robb so acceptable to the Riverlords.

* He will continue as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. I don't really see this happening, as he was just mutinied against. But if he wants to be honorable, there is no way out of his oath. Except...

* ...he is dead and reborn, his watch having ended. He is now free from his vows. He would most likely go to Stannis and be legitimized as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell.

Of course, we are also forgetting a few other wildcards. If R+L=J is true, then he is also the heir to the Targaryen claim (if Aegon is a Blackfyre). If not, he's definitely a contender for that title, and could be included as a third aspect of the next Dance of Dragons. Plus, we have the wildlings. They mostly like Jon, and would probably follow where he goes. They may not kneel the way that Westerosi would, but they would fight for Jon and possibly Stannis if things go on the right way.

We could also see another fighting force declare for him should the dominoes fall the right way. The Queen's Men, while Stannis', belong more to Melissandre. And if she believes Jon to be Azor Ahai reborn, then he will likely have a large part of the Queen's Men on his side. The whole of them if Stannis falls in the upcoming battle.

**Sansa Stark** is in a wonderful position as far as alliances go. If Jon is not legitimized, assuming that Bran stays in Canada and Rickon is out of the picture for a good portion of the war, she is the Queen in the North. Through Robb, she has claim to North and Riverlands, and through both blood (through Cat to Lysa and Robert Arryn), alliance (through Littlefinger), and possible marriage (Robert or Harry the Heir), she will have the Vale with her. It's also possible Littlefinger could maneuver some sort of plot so that Tyrion's claim to Casterly Rock is recognized through Sansa ""Lannister,"" giving her the West as well.

What would this mean? The Knights of the Vale. The Lords of Winter and River. And depending on what other alliances LF can arrange, more than just that. But four kingdoms is more than enough to be one of the most powerful people in the world.

**Rickon Stark** is also a claimant to the north. Ramsay (and possibly Roose, though I don't recall) knows he's alive, as does Wyman Manderly and Davos. Davos is currently on a mission to find Rickon. If he's found, Stannis may either use him to cement his claim on the North, or some northern lords will act as regent for Rickon and rise for him. He's also a bit of a wild card.

Though Bran has the strongest claim of the Starks and Arya has a claim as long as Sansa's missing, I don't consider them players in this. Certainly not at the moment.

Our other claimant to the north is none other than **Roose Bolton**, though he doesn't claim to be king of anything. He's Tommen's Warden of the North, and his family holds both the Dreadfort and Winterfell. Of course, Winterfell might not stay in his hands for long. He currently has the cooperation of the northmen, if not their loyalty. We'll see how far that gets him, though I wouldn't count him out of the fight just yet. But we can't discuss Roose's claim as overlord of the North without disussing his king...

**King Tommen** is in a wholly different position from Stannis. He has inherited the hatred of the Lannisters by the smallfolk, and the Tyrell popularity that boosted Joff in ASOS for a bit isn't so strong anymore. He has a bad regent and schemers as his in-laws. As bad a king as Robert was, at least he surrounded himself with compotent people. Still, Tommen has the West and Crownlands, as well as the Reach, and (officially) Dorne (as they have not declared open rebellion).

When talking of Tommen, we have other power players to consider. One would be **Cersei Lannister**, who served as Queen Regent for most of the period since Robert's death. She currently has as little power as ever. She holds no respect from smallfolk and the pious, and she may well be a head shorter after Ser Robert Strong's battle with the Faith's champion. That'll be a big factor in her power through the end of the song, but it might be for naught. Even if she wins and regains her place as regent (without any other Lannister choice), she has lost not only her respect, but her savviness.

Then it is time to talk of the younger queen, **Margaery Tyrell** and her entire family. Believe which parts of the Grand Tyrell Conspiracy you wish, but you must acknowledge they might be the most powerful family in the series at the moment. After Cersei, there is no one who could be considered for Tommen's regent but Mace Tyrell. The entire city is nearly void of Lannisters now, replaced by the Tyrells. Cersei once said that power was lying on a bed of thorns, ripping them out one by one before they could strangle you (possibly from the show). Well, the bed of roses is King's Landing, and Cersei is gasping for breath.

Moving from King's Landing to Storm's End, we have a different Southron king to discuss.

**King Aegon** is another wild card, though his arc may seem most predictable of all. He has the Golden Company by his side, and the Targaryen name to garner support. He is on his way to conquer the Stormlands, and Dorne is ready to rise up for him. He has ""friends in the Reach,"" and is the only Targaryen in the war as of now. He may even be the only king supported by the Faith, depending on how Cersei's trial ends.

Unlike Stannis, who wanted to war with every false king in the first WoFK, Aegon is now only contending with Tommen. After Dorne and the Stormlands fight the Reach and the Rock, he may turn to the Iron Isles or the North to cement his claim. But for now, his only war seems to be with the Lannister/Tyrell forces. And he seems to be making good work of them fast.

Of course, how can we talk of one Targ and not the other?

**Daenerys Targaryen**, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, *Khaleesi* of the Great Grass Sea, called Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Mother of Dragons. Say what you want about Dany, but her titles are pimipin'.

Some say she's slipping towards madness. Others call her outright cruel. Then there are those loyal to her, who call her kind and just. But we can all agree on one thing: Dany could be set to have the largest fighting force in the world. She currently has the strongest infantry, the Unsullied. In just a chapter or two, she might have a large khalasaar of the strongest cavalry in the world, the Dothraki. Depending on how the Battle of Meereen ends up, she may just have the strongest naval force in the world, the Iron Fleet, ready to bring the Unsullied and Dothraki across the Narrow Sea. Oh, and did I mention she has *mother fucking dragons*?

Still, it's taken five books to get her almost to Westeros, whose to say she'll even land? Well, you may have a point. But the stronger point against her would be her allies in Westeros. She may have Victarion and the hated Imp. She could forgive an heir to Bear Island, but what will that win her? Barristan the Bold might sway some to her cause, but how many? Once upon a time, we could say that she would have the Targaryen legacy to give her strength, but Aegon has already taken that card. She might have earned the Martell loyalty, but through little fault of her own, that was denied.

Could Dany the Conqueror defeat her adversaries and win her throne? Or should she have taken a page from Littlefinger and played the game of thrones for longer? Only time will tell. And despite the naysayers, I do truly believe that she will return to Westeros by the end of the next book. What will happen then is anyone's guess.

Finally, we'll look to our last batch of maybe-kings (and queen)

**King Euron** is no stronger or weaker than he was a when he was crowned. He has the Iron Fleet, although Victarion is not loyal to him. He has grand plans for dragons and conquering, but most of them seem unlikely to come to fruition. Under his rule, the Ironborn have taken the Shield Islands and have been raiding the Reach. It could be enough to sate the ironborn and keep him on the Seastone Chair should Asha contest the kingsmoot.

It's too soon to really say what another kingsmoot will mean, however. **Theon Greyjoy** would be an obvious choice to follow Balon, but would a broken man who could hardly remember his name earn the respect of the ironborn? I think not. Of all the people in **bold** in this post, Theon is the least likely to don a crown.

But what of **Asha**? She will be one of the contenders for the Seastone Chair once more in a second kingsmoot, but what will she have now that she didn't have before? There's Stannis' support (as Lady of Pyke), but she has no significant improvements from the first kingsmoot.

Who does? **Victarion Greyjoy**. When he returns, he might bring Dany and/or dragons. If that happens, he's a shoo-in for the Seastone Chair. He was close as it was, but that might just push him over the edge. Of course, whether he is allied with her or married to her could make a difference. Would she give him the Isles if she has help winning her throne? Or will they sit the Iron Throne together after the war? If Tyrion is part of her entourage, she could have Casterly Rock in addition to Pyke behind her. That trio would be fearsome indeed.

I've maxed the limit of the thread, so my prediction will be in the comments.

He raised the Lannister house from disgrace after their bannerman walked all over his father Tytos. He was Hand of the King for 20 years, and even after Aery kicked him out of Kings Landing he (after some delay) proved himself to the Baratheons by sacking Kings Landing and was able to make Cersei a Queen, giving the Lannisters more power than ever. 

In come his kids. Jaime and Cersei put a bastard on the iron throne, and the threat of the discovery of that secret destableizes the kingdom he worked so hard to keep in order. Cersei decided to kill Robert, putting Joffrey the Prick on the throne. Even Tywin can tell he is a terrible ruler, and Cersei is no better as a Queen Regent. Then the whole kingdom believes his youngest son murders his grandson, and escapes from his cell to kill Tywin. Cersei does her very best in running the kingdom into the ground, and is disgraced and paraded naked through the city. 

After Tywin's rise to being hand of the King, he is descended by a ""Kinslayer,"" a one handed Kingslayer, and a disgraced queen. Also a fat bastard grandson who names his kittens Ser Pounce and Lady Whiskers. 

I don't often feel bad for the ""bad guy"" in a series, but regardless of how ruthless Tywin was, he raised his house from the ground only to have it crumble again, and that sucks.

It's a long list so I won't copy all the questions but here are some that I found interesting:

**Q: Will we know in the next book more things about
Rhaegar? Why he waited a year to join the fight against the
rebellion, Lyanna’s kidnapping…?**

A: We will know more things, but I can’t assure you that it
will be in the next book. You know, keep reading.

**Q: Is there a closer connection between the Children of
the Forest and the Others than it seems?**

A: There could be. This is a developing theme in the story.
I can’t tell you much more right now.

**Q: The Lannisters and the Freys have so many relatives,
while there are very few Starks. Didn’t Ned have any
distant relatives that could claim Winterfell?**

A: It’s true that right now the Freys and the Lannisters
have very large families. The Starks are few now. But there
were many factors to this: in the North, conflicts are
habitual; branches of the Starks have separated from the
main family long ago and formed their own House (the
Karstarks for example, but there could be more…)… and
**you have to take into account the situation at the moment:
we already know how Ned’s children are; Brandon and
Lyanna died with no children**; Benjen joined the Night’s
Watch. And there’s something else to consider: the North
is special. In the North not everyone can rule. Remember
the conversation between Robb and Cat when they are
speaking precisely of this: Cat was talking about a distant
relative from the Vale with Stark blood, and Robb says “he
can’t rule the North, he never set foot there. There’s a
much closer option”, and then it’s Cat who says “never”.
Well, they just denied two options at once there.

**Q: Arthur Dayne has been held up as the epitome of
chivalry. How could he put up with Aerys' crimes, ones
which horrified even Jaime?**

A:Well, keep reading...

**Q:Why did Melisandre (initially) leave to meet
Stannis?  Did she see something at the flames and went of
her own accord, or is she following orders?  At no moment
one gets the sense that she is following orders as we know
that, say, Moqorro is.**

1375900940.0,336,self.asoiaf,1jwfjn,(Spoilers All) A Little Town Called Pennytree,berthok,389,53,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1jwfjn/spoilers_all_a_little_town_called_pennytree/,"While reading ADWD I was caught up by the mention and description of Pennytree. This was where Ser Arlan of Pennytree was from in the Dunk and Egg novellas.  Here's some of the excerpts from ADWD:

    .

&gt; ...the village had a holdfast as strong as any in the riverlands, with thick stone walls twelve feet high, and Jaime knew that was where he'd find the villagers.

&gt; ***--Chapter 48: Page 645 - Jaime - A Dance With Dragons***

    .

&gt; Pennytree proved to be a much larger village than he had anticipated. The war had been here too; blackened orchards and the scorched shells of broken houses testified to that. But for every home in ruins three more had been rebuilt. Through the gathering blue dusk Jaime glimpsed fresh thatch upon a score of roofs, and doors made of raw green wood. Between a duck pond and a blacksmith's forge, he came upon the tree that gave the place its name, an oak ancient and tall. Its gnarled roots twisted in and out of the earth like a nest of slow brown serpents, and hundreds of old copper pennies had been nailed to its huge trunk.

&gt; ***--Chapter 48: Page 644 - Jaime - A Dance With Dragons***

    .

&gt; He tried to count the pennies nailed to the old oak, but there were too many of them and he kept losing count. *What's that all about?* The Blackwood boy would tell him if he asked, but that would spoil the mystery.

&gt; ***--Chapter 48: Page 645 - Jaime - A Dance With Dragons***

    .

The following passage is from the same chapter, and it struck me as quite interesting and thought it might merit some analysis.

    .

&gt; (Jonos) Bracken's mouth set stubbornly. 'All these lands belonged to Stone Hedge once. The Blackwoods stole them from us.'

&gt; 'What about this village here, between the Teats?' Jaime tapped the map with a gilded knuckle.

&gt; '**Pennytree. That was ours once too, but it's been a royal fief for a hundred years.** Leave that out. We ask only for the land stolen by the Blackwoods. Your lord father promised to restore them to us if we would subdue Lord Tytos for him.

&gt; ***--Chapter 48: Page 637 - Jaime - A Dance With Dragons***

    .

We learn that Pennytree has been sworn to the crown for the past hundred years, and no longer belongs to the Blackwoods or the Brackens.  It seems strange to me to find a royal fief so far from King's Landing, as I would expect to see them in [the Crownlands](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Crownlands). It is stranger still that these lands rest in the middle of the blood feud contested lands of Bracken and Blackwood.

Have we seen any other fiefs reporting directly to the crown (outside of the Crownlands)?

What sort of event had happened 'a hundred years' previous which would cause Pennytree to be taken out of the affairs of the local lords? 'A hundred years' back in history from the present ADWD year of 300 would put us in the year 200 (or thereabouts). There were a few people we know who were wandering around the world around that time. Here's a breakdown of some of the dates of note that I was able to quickly compile from the [wiki](http://awoiaf.westeros.org).

* 150 AL - Arlan of Pennytree born *(approximate year)*
* 172 AL - Aegor Rivers 'Bittersteel' born
* 175 AL - Brynden Rivers 'Bloodraven' born
* 192 AL - Duncan the Tall born *(approximate year)*
* 194 AL - Roger of Pennytree dies (Battle of the Redgrass Field)
* 194 AL - Bittersteel flees Westeros
* 200 AL - Pennytree made a royal fief *(approximate year)*
* 205 AL - Otho Bracken 'The Brute of Bracken' slays Lord Quentyn Blackwood at a King's Landing tournament
* 209 AL - Bloodraven becomes Hand to the King
* 209 AL - Arlan of Pennytree dies
* 211 AL - Beron Stark attempts to repel Dagon Greyjoy from Stony Shore
* 211 AL - Otho Bracken becomes Lord of Stone Hedge
* 211 AL - House Blackwood declares war upon Bracken to oust 'The Brute of Bracken'
* 212 AL - Second Blackfyre Rebellion at Whitewalls

I have a suspicion about it, and it doesn't have any supporting evidence, so take it as you will.  I believe Dunk and Egg were responsible for Pennytree's current state, in one way of another.

**I believe that Dunk and Egg (maybe on their way back from visiting Winterfell) stopped by Pennytree so that Dunk could finally see Arlan's origins. They find a war-torn and ragged ruin from The Brute of Bracken and the Blackwoods feuding, and then they find themselves thrown in the middle of it.**

The only other person I can think who would be involved is Bloodraven, but he was really concentrating on Bittersteel and preventing him from having opportunity to return to Westeros at the time, even to the point of ignoring Dagon Greyjoy's invasion.

Bloodraven certainly had ties to want the 'teats' and what lay between, as we see in the following excerpt.

    .

&gt; 'Aegon the Unworthy took Barba Bracken as his mistress,' the bookish boy (Hoster Blackwood) replied. 'She was a very buxom wench, they say, and one day when the king was visiting at Stone Hedge he went out hunting and saw the Teats and...'

&gt; '...named them for his mistress.' Aegon the Fourth had died long before Jaime had been born, but he recalled enough of the history of his reign to guess what must have happened next. 'Only later he put the Bracken girl aside and took up with the Blackwood, was that the way of it?'

&gt; 'Lady Melissa,' Hoster confirmed. 'Missy, they called her. 
There's a statue of her in our godswood. She was *much* more beautiful than Barba Bracken, but slender, and Barba was heard to say that Missy was flat as a boy. When King Aegon heard, he...'

&gt; '...gave her Barba's teats.' Jaime laughed.""

&gt; ***--Chapter 48: Page 643 - Jaime - A Dance With Dragons***

    .

We see here a small anecdote of the ongoing opposition between Bracken and Blackwood, but an important insight into the history of two of the realm's past (or ongoing) influences. Aegon the Unworthy's lovers Barba Bracken and Melissa Blackwood are Bittersteel and Bloodraven's mothers, and here we see Aegon the Unworthy adding fuel to the feud-fire.

There's one person who probably knows the truth and history of all of it, but Jaime doesn't seem to want to ask any questions of him...

    .

&gt; The Blackwood boy would tell him if he asked, but that would spoil the mystery.

Haven't you arrived too early in King's Landing?"" After all, with both there while Sansa is still there, shouldn't Brienne rescue her? Here's what I think will happen:

* Jaime and Brienne will try to take Sansa away, but now that she's married, she's Tyrion's property in sight of gods and men; you can't separate a couple that has been officially married as that would be an affront to the gods. (I think Robb mentions this in ASOS; he couldn't just take Sansa away; he would need to actually kill Tyrion to rescue her.)

* However, Tyrion (who also wants to help Sansa) will mention that he never consummated the marriage, so it can be annulled; this requires the High Septon, which is under Tywin's control. Now, obviously, Tywin would never accept Tyrion asking to annul the marriage, but if Jaime asks, it's another story altogether.

* Jaime has a little chat with Tywin. Tywin is all ""why the fuck would I annul the marriage"", to which Jaime replies that he swore an oath to Catelyn Stark. But Tywin replies ""lol wut Catelyn is dead I don't care"". Then the scene proceeds with the other discussion Jaime and Tywin had in the books, about Jaime being released from the Kingsguard. Jaime gets pissed that his dad wants him to break both oaths, you know how the scene ends, etc.

* Jaime, Brienne, Tyrion and Varys plot to smuggle Sansa away. Jaime and Brienne can't just stand idle with Sansa there, otherwise Lady Stoneheart's claims that Brienne broke her oath have merit. EDIT: Some people have asked where exactly they would send Sansa to. The easiest answer is to the Vale, since Lysa is the only family she has left (and like someone said it would really ironic, given it's where Sansa ends up anyway), but there are other possibilities. I leave to D&amp;D to decide.

* Dontos is reintroduced to save Sansa. Show-watchers think he's part of Varys's schemes.

* Then during the Purple Wedding, Dontos rescues Sansa. Jaime and Brienne are all ""where the fuck is Sansa"" so the audience has no idea what is happening until BAM! Littlefinger!

As I was rereading one of my favorite scenes in aSoS, Oberyn vs the Mountain, I noticed something. Cersei had Gregor paint his shield over with the seven pointed star of the seven. As Oberyn fights him, some of the paint is chipped away to reveal two dogs. 
Assuming Robert Strong is the Mountain (mostly), then one of these two dogs would represent him. Qyburn dressed Robert up in religious accessories (Rainbow plume, seven-pointed star) to ornament his Kingsguard armor. So he is a dog hiding behind the faith (figuratively speaking).
Now, Assuming Sandor is the gravedigger on the Quiet Isle, we have our second dog. 
The Hound and the Mountain are both hidden, partially by the Faith.

I was a fool, I never put myself in her place because of her constantly being hung up on her fairy tales (this was made even more difficult because her sister is a little miss badass) and I missed one of the most interesting and profound character developments in the series.  Sansa is no longer a vapid minded little girl wanting only to be the Queen of some dashing King, she is jaded, slightly cynical (Arya will love that bit for sure) and first and foremost she is learning to play the game of thrones and is now apprenticed to the master.  I'll leave it here, if anyone wants to make fun of me for taking so long to come to this conclusion feel free I deserve it.

1374094311.0,330,self.asoiaf,1iift6,"(Spoilers All) Coldhands, the Night's King and Bran's Weirwood Visions.",AerionTargaryen,381,51,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1iift6/spoilers_all_coldhands_the_nights_king_and_brans/,"Hello all, I wish to make the case that Coldhands is the Night's King and that Bran witnesses his execution in his final weirwood vision.

If you are unfamiliar, read up: http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s_King

Bran's final weirwood vision in DwD: 
&gt; And now the lords Bran glimpsed were tall and hard, stern men in fur and chain mail. Some wore faces he remembered from the statues in the crypts, but they were gone before he could put a name to them. Then, as he watched, a bearded man forced a captive down onto his knees before the heart tree. A white-haired woman stepped through a drift of dark red leaves, a bronze sickle in her hand. ""No,"" said Bran, ""no, don't,"" but they could not hear him, no more than his father had. The woman grabbed the captive by the hair, hooked the sickle round his throat, and slashed. And through the mist of centuries the broken boy could only watch as the man's feet drummed against the earth . . . but as the life flowed out of him in a red tide, Brandon Stark could tasted the blood.

Starting with Bran's weirwood visions at Winterfell. Bran's visions progress backwards, with each jumping backwards further and faster. After the second to last vision (which I believe is Brandon Snow planning to kill Aegon the Conqueror's dragons), the visions start to progress *really fast* with Bran barely recognizing the ancient Stark lords from Winterfell's crypts. We then get the final vision, the execution scene quoted above. The first thing to clarify is the time frame: It's then pointed out that the woman has a bronze sickle. This is crucial because the First Men used bronze weapons before the Andals brought iron to Westeros 6,000 years ago. This allows us to place the execution between 8,000 years ago (the Long Night) and 6,000 years ago.

Now what Starks do we know from this era from legends and Old Nan's tales? There are very few: Bran the Builder, the Night's King and his brother, a Stark lord of Winterfell. The problem with Bran the Builder is we don't know of any execution he was involved in. The Night's King, however, makes perfect sense considering his Stark lord brother supposedly took him down and presumably executed him. 

This is where it gets interesting. Old Nan explicitly said that she thought the Night's King name was Brandon/Bran. What if Martin's last line in Bran's weirwood vision is a double entendre? ""but as the life flowed out of him in a red tide, Brandon Stark could taste the blood."" Perhaps Martin means that both Bran and the executed man are named Brandon Stark, the latter being the Brandon Stark who was the Night's King.

But there's more. This very same double entendre occurs at least one other time - when Bran first meets Coldhands north of the Wall. When Bran asks him who he is, Coldhands replies: ""Your monster, Brandon Stark."" I believe that this is *incredibly* significant and is meant to tie Coldhands to the Night's King.

What do we know about Coldhands? He's a black brother - the Night's King was Lord Commander. According to Leaf of the CotF, he died ""long ago"" - the Night's King died 6-8,000 years ago, long even in CotF time (this is usually used to rule out Benjen). Finally, Coldhands is said to be wearing *chain mail armor* under his cloak. Now this is often used against Coldhands being the Night's King, the logic being chain mail only came when the Andals brought iron. However, as Bran's last visions approach the execution scene, he actually sees ""tall and hard, stern men in fur and *chain mail*."" I take this to mean that chain mail (perhaps made of bronze) existed contemporaneously with bronze weapons (the executioner's sickle) *before* the arrival of the Andals. This means that Coldhands's chain mail could feasibly come from the pre-Andal era. Or he looted it from someone he killed, which works too.

And finally, the Night's King's copulation with an Other and ""giving her his soul"" could explain Coldhands's strange condition as a sentient wight.  It also makes sense that Coldhands keeps his face covered, given that he had his neck gruesomely cut by a sickle.

I think it's all there: the execution, the weapons, the chain mail, the double entendre (this is my favorite), the death ""long ago,"" both being black brothers and explaining the existence of a sentient wight.

Man, i have so much respect for this character and he appears only four to five times, but he's just such a badass.

He couldn't afford knighthood, so he *earned it* by kicking ass in the Greyjoy rebellion and losing his right hand while doing so.

Does that stop him? Fuck no, he get's himself and iron prosthetic hand and becomes Captain of the Gold Cloaks at the Mud Gate.

He's honorable, brave and follows orders faitfully and he's like Tyrion's Davos for a while: he speaks his mind calmly and politely to him, speaking his mind and offering help and never tries to brownose Tyrion for favors. He earns them with his deeds. He always gives Tyrion what he needs to hear.

During The Battle of Blackwater, after seeing his men flee after Joffrey retreated, this amputee with an irnohand rallies them back for battle.... aaaand promptly get's hit in the throat, dying for his efforts to keep the city safe.

He doesn't appear that many times, but by the Gods he's just such a badass.

Another shout out to the Crannogmen and The Mountain Clans.

The Crannogmen mind their own bussiness, don't bother a whole lot of people, but you better kiss your ass goodby if you try to pass through by force and try to take over The North.

It is because of the skill and wit of The Crannogmen and the hostile enviroment of The Neck that for thousands of years, The Andals couldn't conquer The North.

When the Ironborn, armed with their sense of superiority and sheer lack of judgement, attacked The Neck, they loose Moat Cailin but the Ironborn suffer horibly the entire time, and it doesn't seem that the people of The Neck will take kindly to the new Warden of The North.

And now The Mountain Clans.

Good Gods these guys are just awesome. They live in a very hostile enviroment, plauged by Wildling raiders. They are *unflinchingly loyal* to the Starks and fought along with Robb. The only reason why they went along with Stannis is because they wanted to save Eddard's ""daughter"".

They call Eddard ""The Ned"". Not Stark, not ""My Lord"", not even ""The Stark"". No, they call him ""The Ned"" because they see him as a friend rather than a lord and vasal.

So yeah, show your appreciation here :P

For years now one of the most important rules/policies that our subreddit has had is our so-called ""Don't Be a Dick"" policy. Essentially this rule means that we crows can disagree without being disagreeable. I believe this fundamental belief has made the Wall one of the friendliest and most mature places on all of the Internet to constructively discuss all things ASOIAF related.

My fellow Maesters and I recently looked over the policy as it currently stands and decided to clarify more specifically what this rule actually means based on our years of subjectively enforcing it. What follows, then, is the language of the brand new DBAD policy:

***

*A violation of the Civility Policy, AKA the Don't Be a Dick (or DBAD) policy, would include clear malicious intent to offend or anger others whether via comments, post titles, or user-names.*

**Being a dick means:**

* outright insults to another person (*You're an asshole, you're stupid, you're fucking useless*, etc.)

* posting any image as a response to a comment where the image is clearly intended to be disrespectful (e.g. the Stalin *""Dear Diary, Today OP was a Fag""* image).

* using movie/book/TV quotes to insult someone (*""There's no cure for being a cunt.""*)

* Being condescending (*""Aren't you and your opinions just precious you sweet summer child?""*)

* Being disrespectful when telling someone they've made a mistake (*""Can't you fucking read? That fact is right in the book.""*)

**Being a dick is not:**

* blunt language where there is no intent to insult or disparage a fellow crow (e.g. *""I fucking hate, HATE that god-damned Walder Frey!""*).

* simple disagreements (*This is the way I think it should be interpreted. This is the way it should be done. This is what it says. etc.* As compared to the dick response: *Your point of view is completely invalid because you clearly don't have the mental capacity to understand what you're doing. My way is the right way and the only way.*, etc.)

* telling someone they're wrong in a respectful manner (*""You're mistaken, the actual quote says...""* The dick response is: *""You're wrong you complete moron.""*)

Posts and/or comments violating this policy will be removed and in most cases the Maesters will issue warnings to those in violation of this Civility Policy. In extreme cases the Maesters do, however, reserve the right to issue an out-right ban.

***

For 99.9% of you this updated version of our DBAD policy will mean little and less. Most of you are awesome, respectful, and mature readers of these books. For the rest of you? Be forewarned: we will be stricter than ever now with this policy going forward. As reddit in general, and /r/asoiaf in particular, have grown there has been a noticeable increase in trollish/dickish behavior all across the site. This will not be tolerated on the Wall. Remember that we can be passionate about our beliefs and arguments about this or that theory while still being polite to one another.

We're all adults here. This is not XBox Live or 4chan or any of the many other outlets for immature, childish behavior. This is the Wall: we're all brothers and sisters here. If you see someone behaving otherwise please utilize the report button and we Maesters will take the necessary action to enforce this policy.

Feel free to discuss or nit-pick this policy here in the comments. As of right now [this policy is official](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/wiki/faq#wiki_6._what_kind_of_limits_do_you_put_on_people_being_.201Crude.201D.3F).

***
* Sam runs away by himself and finds a headless brother freshly frozen in the snow.  He turn to find a White Walker (maybe a wight) coming at him with an axe, but Ghost (?) attacks it.  Mormont and the other black brothers come across sam and burn it with a fire arrow.  Mormont asks Sam if he sent the Ravens and Sam says no, and gets chastised for it.  Mormont gives a speech to the brothers, then the GoT intro happens.

* Jon is led to the wildling camp with Ygritte and her buddies. A GIANT! Looks amazing, CGI for this season is awesome already.  Ygritte and Jon talk while she leads him to the leaders.  Rattleshirt, Tormund, and Mace.  Jon mistakes Tormund for Mace.  Mace and Jon talk and shake hands.  Jon tries to convince Mace that he wants to join Mace. To get crossed over Jon tells Mace that he saw an Other, and that when he told the Lord Commander, he didn't get a proper response.  He asks Mace if he joined the side that wants to kills them, and Mace accepts him.

* Bronn is with a whore.  Pod comes in and interrupts him and tells Bronn that Tyrion needs him immediately. Bronn doesn't want to go.  Tyrion looks at his scar on his face, and Cersei enters. He doesn't trust her and won't let the guards in.  He grabs and axe and lets her in.  They chat for a bit and then Bronn talks with the two Kingsguard outside the door.  Cersei leaves and Bronn enters.  Bronn agrees to work with Tyrion for double the price.

* Davos looks like death on the fingers as he sees a passing ship.  They send a rescue boat and ask him which king he supports.  He tells them Stannis, and they let him on board.  Davos chats with Salla on board the ship.  Salla tells Davos about how dire things look for Stannis and tries to convince Davos not to go to Dragonstone.

* Robb and Roose look at Harrenhal before entering with their army.  It's deserted, with dead bodies of Northman everywhere.  They find Qyburn alive and give him water.

* Tywin and Tyrion meet while Tywin signs paperwork.  Tywin chastises Tyrion about having brought whores into the hand's bed.  Tyrion is pissed that he hasn't got any congratulations for his work in the battle.  Tyrion asks for Casterly Rock, and Tywin tells him he will get something significantly less than that, and then makes him feel like shit for killing his mother and sleeping with whores.

* Sansa talks with Shae and Littlefinger comesin and talks to Sansa privately.  He tells her he saw his mom and Arya recently, and that he is going to send her away with him when he asks her on a whims notice.  

* Drogon flying around the ship with Dany, frying food and eating it - they look amazing. They will be in Astapor next, and Dany tells Jorah that she needs an army.  

* Mel and Davos argue in front of Stannis. She tells Davos that she burned his son, and he tries to kill Mel and gets thrown into a dungeon. 

* Joff is getting transported through the city in his litter.  The litter stops as Maergery walks among the people and people are surprised she is walking among the people.  She talks with a group of orphans who lost their dads in the war.  She gives them a speech to encourage them - they are loving it.  Joff looks pissed.

* There is a dinner with Maergery, Joff, Loras and the Queen.  It's pretty damn awkward.  

* Dany meets with the owner of the Unsullied and hears about their training and history. An assassin tries to kill her and Selmy shows up to stop it. Jorah knows him immediately and calls him out.  He swears fealty to her and the episode ends.

As the conversation comes to an end, we get this tidbit:

&gt;Maester Aemon closed his eyes, and for a brief moment Jon was afraid that he had gone to sleep.  Finally he said, ""Maester Luwin taught you well, Jon Snow.  Your mind is as deft as your blade, it would seem.""

On my first read through, I didn't give this much thought, figuring that he was just conceding that he'd try to help Sam.  Now, however, I'm starting to wonder if Jon inadvertently set himself up to being chosen as a Steward instead of a Ranger.  We know that he's widely regarded as the best swordsman in his graduating class (so to speak) and his peers expected him to be a Ranger.  I think that his conversation convinced Aemon not only to ask for Sam as a Steward, but maybe bring to the Old Bear's attention that Jon may be a good choice for future leadership.  By trying to help out Sam, Jon accidentally gets his career assignment changed.

**VII. No True Knights**

*In the name of the Warrior I charge you to be brave.*

*In the name of the Father I charge you to be just.*

*In the name of the Mother I charge you to defend the young and innocent.*

*In the name of the Maid I charge you to protect all women...* 

&amp;#32; &amp;#822;&amp;#32; oath of knighthood (The Hedge Knight)

...

When they first start traveling together, Brienne scornfully calls Jaime, ""Kingslayer"" and Jaime derisively names her, ""wench"". The nicknames highlight how each of them is no true knight. Jaime can't leave his crime behind; it taints everything he does (""Why must they misunderstand every bloody thing he did? Aerys. It all grows from Aerys."" ASOS 62/Jaime VII). Brienne can't leave her gender behind; it limits her choices and opportunities. Her gender is even posited as the reason she supposedly killed Renly--she was lovesick or maybe (&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;) on her period. The significance of the nicknames is foregrounded at the start of their journey:

&gt;“You will call me Brienne. Not wench.”

&gt;“My name is Ser Jaime. Not Kingslayer.”

&gt;“Do you deny that you slew a king?”

&gt;“No. Do you deny your sex? If so, unlace those breeches and show me.” (ASOS 1/Jaime I)

Jaime has repeatedly broken his vows, which she never fails to point out:

&gt;...“I did not intend to give offense, Brienne. Forgive me.”

&gt;“Your crimes are past forgiving, Kingslayer.”

&gt;“That name again...Why do I enrage you so? I’ve never done you harm that I know of.”

&gt;“You’ve harmed others. Those you were sworn to protect. The weak, the innocent...”

&gt;...

&gt;“Why did you take the oath?...Why don the white cloak if you meant to betray all it stood for?” (ASOS 11/Jaime II)

Brienne loathed Jaime because he has besmirched a role that she idealized:

&gt;“It is a rare and precious gift to be a knight...and even more so a knight of the Kingsguard. It is a gift given to few, a gift you scorned and soiled.”

&gt;A gift you want desperately, wench, and can never have. “I earned my knighthood. Nothing was given to me. I won a tourney melee at thirteen...At fifteen, I rode with Ser Arthur Dayne against the Kingswood Brotherhood, and he knighted me on the battlefield. It was that white cloak that soiled me, not the other way around. So spare me your envy....” (ASOS 11/Jaime II)

Jaime missed Brienne's point--prowess in battle isn't the only thing that distinguishes a knight. He is also supposed to be a moral paragon. Barristan Selmy taught his squires that ""it is chivalry which makes a true knight, not a sword … without honor, a knight is no more than a common killer."" (ADWD 68/The Kingbreaker). Jaime claimed the white cloak soiled him, but it becomes apparent that this doesn't reflect his true feelings about the matter.

Brienne is also angry at Jaime because he reminds her of her own limitations and failures. Despite her efforts to be worthy of Renly's rainbow cloak, she is nearly as infamous as Jaime Lannister is. At one point, he points out that they are both kingslayers:

&gt;Jaime said, “You are not old enough to have known Aerys Targaryen...”

&gt;She would not hear it. “Aerys was mad and cruel, no one has ever denied that. He was still king, crowned and anointed. And you had sworn to protect him.”

&gt;“I know what I swore.”

&gt;“And what you did.” She loomed above him, six feet of freckled, frowning, horse-toothed disapproval.

&gt;“Yes, and what you did as well. We’re both kingslayers here, if what I’ve heard is true.”

&gt;...

&gt;“Tell me true, one kingslayer to another did the Starks pay you to slit his throat, or was it Stannis? Had Renly spurned you, was that the way of it? Or perhaps your moon’s blood was on you. Never give a wench a sword when she’s bleeding.”

&gt;For a moment Jaime thought Brienne might strike him... (ASOS 11/Jaime II)

Brienne harped on him for having failed to keep his Kingsguard oath because she too failed to keep her Kingsguard oath. Loras directly connected her failure as a Kingsguard to her gender (""She deserves death. I told Renly that a woman had no place in the Rainbow Guard. She won the melee with a trick"" ASOS 67/Jaime VIII). Brienne failed Renly just like Jaime failed Rhaegar. Her anger at Jaime was partly a case of projection. Her scornful treatment of him was an attempt to distance herself from him, to convince the world (and herself) that she was nothing like the despised Kingslayer: 

&gt;He turned abruptly and galloped back to find Brienne...The wench rode well behind and a few feet off to the side, as if to proclaim that she was no part of them. (ASOS 62/Jaime VII)

For his part, Jaime vacillated between wry amusement and irritation at Brienne's naivete (""She is such an innocent."" ASOS 37/Jaime V) and dedication. He grew as tired of hearing her stubbornly repeat, ""I swore a vow"" as most readers probably did (""Has anyone ever told you that you’re as tedious as you are ugly? ASOS 11/Jaime II). But ultimately, he came to appreciate Brienne's persistence and gave her another quest to complete, one that happened to perfectly encapsulates the core values of chivalry: fulfill a holy vow to rescue and protect an innocent maid.

Jaime has come to realize the worth of the Maid of Tarth. She is brave, dedicated, honorable, kind to the weak, and incorruptible--the ideal knight. This was something even Renly realized:

&gt;[Loras] “Renly thought she was absurd. A woman dressed in man’s mail, pretending to be a knight.”

&gt;[Jaime] “If he’d ever seen her in pink satin and Myrish lace, he would not have complained.”

&gt;“I asked him why he kept her close, if he thought her so grotesque. He said that all his other knights wanted things of him, castles or honors or riches, but all that Brienne wanted was to die for him. (ASOS 67/Jaime VIII)

Brienne's purity is partly due to her naïveté. [Brienne is nearly as sheltered, innocent, and romantic as the girl she's been looking for.](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dl37d/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/)  Like Sansa, Brienne has been brought up on tales of knightly valor:

&gt;“There was always a singer at Evenfall Hall when I was a girl,” Brienne said quietly. “I learned all the songs by heart.”

&gt;[Catelyn] “Sansa did the same, though few singers ever cared to make the long journey north to Winterfell.” (ACOK 45/Catelyn VI)

In a revealing conversation, Brienne told Nimble Dick about The Perfect Knight (note how similar his name is to [Sir Galahad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galahad)):

&gt;“Every place has its local heroes. Where I come from, the singers sing of Ser Galladon of Morne, the Perfect Knight.”

&gt;“Ser Gallawho of What?...Never heard o’ him. Why was he so bloody perfect?”

&gt;“Ser Galladon was a champion of such valor that the Maiden herself lost her heart to him. She gave him an enchanted sword as a token of her love. The Just Maid, it was called. No common sword could check her, nor any shield withstand her kiss. Ser Galladon bore the Just Maid proudly, but only thrice did he unsheathe her. He would not use the Maid against a mortal man, for she was so potent as to make any fight unfair.”

&gt;...“The Perfect Knight? The Perfect Fool, he sounds like. What’s the point o’ having some magic sword if you don’t bloody well use it?”

&gt;“Honor,” she said. “The point is honor.” (AFFC 20/Brienne IV)

Yet we meet Brienne while she's in the process of realizing that the songs of her childhood are bullshit. This disillusionment comes about because she is a living challenge to the social system that produced those songs. She has discovered that knights are as apt as the rest of us to engage in unworthy behavior. [Her terrible experiences with Ser Ronnet and Renly's knights of summer](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dmz7p/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/) taught her she could not rely on the code of chivalry to protect her. The social contract between women and men in Westerosi society--women had no rights and little freedom, but could count on protection and gentle treatment from honorable men--does not extend to ugly, mannish women:

&gt;I was not always wary...When I was a little girl I believed that all men were as noble as my father. Even the men who told her what a pretty girl she was, how tall and bright and clever, how graceful when she danced... Septa Roelle...had lifted the scales from her eyes. “They only say those things to win your lord father’s favor,...You’ll find truth in your looking glass, not on the tongues of men.” It was a harsh lesson, one that left her weeping, but it had stood her in good stead at Harrenhal when Ser Hyle and his friends had played their game. A maid has to be mistrustful in this world, or she will not be a maid for long, (AFFC 20/Brienne IV)

Brienne's disillusionment with the songs of her girlhood was cemented by the death of Renly (the chivalric ideal for Brienne) and her journeys in ASOS and AFFC. Her travels through the riverlands showed her the things that the singers never mentioned, the death, atrocities, and suffering caused by war and gallant knights.

The chivalric system is meant to protect women, but because Brienne has refused to adhere to gender norms, it actively works against her. Roose Bolton clad her in pink silk, but gave her back to Vargo Hoat (ASOS 37/Jaime V). Randyll Tarly relished pointing out that Brienne would probably be raped if she continued on her quest (""Lord Randyll is of the view that you might benefit from a good hard raping"" AFFC 25/Brienne V). The hedge knights she meets on the road are either ineffectual or untrustworthy. Every armed man she encounters is a potential predator, not a protector.

Having said that, lets begin.

If there was ever a record for the house that fucked up the most stuff, it would be the Tullys.

Let's begin with Lysa.  Lysa's got a pretty good thing going for her.  She's in the capital where she can spend time with her true love Littlefinger.  She doesn't have to do anything but dote on her son.  She's rich and she gets to live in the lovely climate of Kings Landing, not the cold harsh Eyrie which she says she hated.  But, to be able to finally be with her true love, she poisons her husband, and drags the whole realm down the rabbit hole.  Lovely.  It all turned out so well for her too /s  If she could have just kept it in her pants, this whole damn thing might not have happened.  You got played.  Dude never even liked you but you were too blinded by your own emotions to realize it.  You crazy, ho.

Then, you've got Catelyn, the overreaction queen.  Hey Ned, you had sex with a whore while you were at war like EVERY SINGLE OTHER MAN in the Seven Kingdoms?  I'm going to make both of your lives a living hell for the next 14 years, then I'm going to send him off to the Wall where I hope he freezes and dies.  I only wish she had survived until the end of the series so that she could find out about R+L=J and off herself for being such a douche to her truly faithful husband for so damn long.  Then she thinks a Lannister pushed her son out of a window.  Okay, pretty reasonable.  OBVIOUSLY it was the dwarf, who is the same damn size as the kid and probably couldn't overpower him if he wanted to.  After all, he stopped by Winterfell to pay his respects and give them plans for a saddle to help Bran ride.  Obviously he's just trying to cover up for himself, he must have done it!  Lets arrest him on the road, nothing could possibly go wrong!   Sigh.  Maybe you should have talked that over with Ned first, hun.  Now she's out prancing around being a vengeful bitch as this ""Lady Stoneheart"" character, and I swear to god if she/the BWB kills Jamie Lannister as he's in the middle of his road to redemption and trying to become a better man I'm going to be livid.

Oh, and then you've got Mister ""I need to make a name for myself"" Edmure.  Enjoy living the rest of your life as a prisoner in Lannisport, jackass.  If you would have just stayed inside your walls and defended Riverrun like you were told, The Mountain would have led the Lannister host west, been crushed by Robb, and Kings Landing would have fallen to Stannis.  Congratulations, you fucked up the lives of TWO kings.  If Robb comes back with the Lannister army defeated and Kings Landing in Stannis' hands, there is no way Walder Frey has the balls to pull the Red Wedding.  Robb gets to move his army north, retakes Winterfell and puts the Bastard of Bolton's head on a spike.  And we likely get to meet Howland Reed sooner as a result so we wouldn't still be left wondering about R+L=J.

Oh, and Hoster Tully, I know I said you were exempt, but there is this.  How the hell did you let Walder Frey live so damn long?  The dude should win the award for ""worst bannerman ever"" every single effing year.  You should have Tywin Lannistered' that shit a long time ago and given the Twins to a more loyal contingent.  Then Robb wouldn't have had to agree to that idiotic wedding contract in the first place.

So Blackfish, I'm glad you escaped.  You're a pretty cool guy, and you have your work cut out for you.  Best get started cleaning up that family name.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,,True,t3_zn8ha,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/zn8ha/spoiler_all_rant_i_hate_the_tullys/,
1341644700.0,320,self.asoiaf,w64za,(SPOILERS BOOKS 1-4) Was the connection between Melisandre's vision and the dragons obvious? It was just pointed out to me. ,Static_Line_Bait,401,81,133,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/w64za/spoilers_books_14_was_the_connection_between/,"According to Melisandre's visions: to create a dragon you're supposed to have the blood of a king, and the dragon itself will come forth from stone. What she doesn't realize is that the dragons have already come forth from the ""stone"" (Daenerys's eggs before they were ""triggered"" with blood and fire, so to speak). 


A couple (?) of the later Targaryen kings were convinced they could be reborn as dragons (my memory is patchy on this; at least one, Aerion, thought he would be reborn as a dragon, and drank wildfire). Aerion almost had it right... except there was no egg for his soul to pass into, and the fire was supposed to be for the egg, not him.


Three ""royal"" lives were lost fairly close to the eggs- Khal Drogo, Viserys, and Daenerys's unborn child, with each death unlocking/preparing one of the eggs for hatching as per Melisandre's vision(as the soul of the deceased passed into the egg). As Daenerys herself says, two of the dragons remind her of her husband and brother... and for a very good reason.


Dragons take on characteristics of the life used to hatch them- the later Targaryen dragons were stunted and twisted due to the inbreeding and madness in the Targaryen line (or was it that the Targaryens refused to sacrifice a royal life and used only a little blood, like Stannis wanted to do?). The hatching of eggs would have been a very closely guarded secret, and the knowledge was lost over time- did Aerion see a glimpse of the truth in his madness, or was it an old (and altered) tale that led him to do what he did?


(Forgive the scattered-ness and the crappy grammar, I'm very tired but wanted to fire this off before I go to bed. Oh, and one last thing- the prophecy concerning Daenerys's son could still theoretically come to pass; his death and rebirth as a dragon may have been required to even begin to fulfill it. Makes me wonder about Azor Ahai).


TLDR: Melisandre's late to the game, the dragon(s) has been hatched from the ""stone"" (egg) already, using the blood of kings- dragon eggs are all lifeless without a soul to inhabit them, which is where the deaths of Khal Drogo, Viserys, and Rhaego come into play.

1371557767.0,315,self.asoiaf,1gkvyq,(Spoilers TWOW) On the accuracy of a particular letter received by one Jon Snow.,thesearmsshootlasers,408,93,236,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1gkvyq/spoilers_twow_on_the_accuracy_of_a_particular/,"Let me preface by saying this stuff doesn't seem particularly clever to me, especially since I myself managed to arrive at this conclusion. I'm also reasonably certain some discussion on this must have been done before. I wouldn't even be posting this is someone hadn't linked to [this article](http://branvras.free.fr/HuisClos/Guide.html) (warning spoilers all). I'm sure the letter Jon receives from Ramsay regarding the fate of Stannis has been discussed before, but I wasn't sure if we had an agreed upon theory of what actually happened. The linked article assumes it's accurate for the sake of discussion, but in my mind there is little to no chance Ramsay was successful in defeating Stannis and I feel the need to prove it goddammit.

**The meta stuff**

* GRRM has already set a precedent for giving ""false positives"" in regards to characters' deaths, as he did with the fate of Davos at White Harbour. This means we can't trust what we read if it's not actually confirmed in a character's POV. You could in fact argue that we *shouldn't* trust it. As good a writer as GRRM is, he does have his ""tells"" or habits that practised readers will recognise, which leads to my next point.

* In the preview chapters for TWOW, Stannis is tight-lipped about his plans for defeating the approaching army and reveals nothing to Theon. GRRM loves to have his characters give an exposition of their grand plans right before they fail. When a character has great and hopeful plans revealed to us, it makes their death or failure harder to bear as readers. Unfortunately, this pattern can be easy to spot. I'm sure others noticed it earlier than me but as soon as Arianne gave her exposition in AFFC I knew it was never going to work. Stannis has not given anything away and so still has a pretty good chance of survival. The reveal will not be given in exposition, but shown in action when the battle occurs.

**The plot stuff**

* In TWOW Theon estimates Bolton will send out half of his forces, this is a match for Stannis' depleted army, but at least some of those soldiers are Manderleys, who will switch sides as soon as the battle begins or even beforehand. Additionally, as speculated in the article linked above, there is a good chance the Umbers are not divided, but working together in secret against the Boltons and will also switch sides at the time of battle. This will both bolster Stannis' army and weaken Bolton's. Add to this Stannis' plan, whatever it is, and there's a good chance the offensive against Stannis will be a blood bath, but not the one Bolton and Theon are expecting.

* With all this in mind, there is still the fact that the letter was sent, so how and why? With the Bolton loyalists utterly defeated, Manderley can return and give a ""false positive"" in regards to the defeat of Stannis. He's got form here, as I mentioned above. Umber could support him. A few random heads posing as friends of Stannis to be mounted on the wall and a lend of Stannis' sword and we have enough to convince Ramsay.

* The idea that Ramsay was lied to is supported by the fact that he thinks Theon has gone to wall with Jeyne. They haven't, and so perhaps this was invented to spare Theon returning to Ramsay's clutches (or for a good old fashioned bonfire). Regardless, they are unaccounted for, and likely still in the possession of Stannis and not at the wall.

So, we have a lie told to Ramsay, a Stannis army ready to attack outside, and a Manderley and Umber alliance on the inside. Ramsay thinks he is in a good position, and his cockiness in sending the letter hints at an imminent fall. He's also making a bit of an empty threat, since he's got a long and deadly cold march if he wants to reach jon and cut his heart out. Tactically, Jon would have been better off sending a raven back just saying ""Bring It"" rather than attempting to sway the Night's Watch. They likely would have even ended up fighting for him rather than turning on him if a Bolton army turned up and started attacking. A difficult battle, sure, but no harder than marching on and attacking Winterfell.

I admit I'm not sure how Mance Rayder's being revealed fits in, but that was outside the knowledge of Stannis and the others in any case. I also admit that the main reason I think this is an accurate theory is due to the meta stuff and GRRM's prior form. I'm fully aware GRRM likes to mess with us and surprise us as well, so this could all be bunk. But I doubt it.

As I said above, I don't think any of this is particularly clever thinking, but the assumption in the linked article made me want to debunk the idea that the letter was true. If all this has been discussed before I hope there is at least some value in collecting it all in one long post.

Fire away, haters.

I've been totally stumped when speculating on who the third head of the dragon is (assuming Dany and Jon are the first two). A lot of subtle evidence points to Aegon being fake, and ending up at odds with Dany. All of the other theories seem much too convoluted, and none seemed to ""fit"". Yesterday, though, I read this quote from Alfie Allen, talking about Jon's parentage (which Martin told him the truth of):
 
""it involves a bit of a Luke Skywalker situation."" 

This could mean nothing, just that Jon was raised to think of his parentage a certain way, only to find out things were in truth very different from what he suspected. Or, (and please hear me through on this), it could mean Jon has a twin sister, from whom he was separated at birth. I started checking AWOIAF and the books, and came to this:

**Meera Reed is Jon's twin sister, and the third head of the Dragon**. Lets break down the pros and cons.

Pros:

* Meera was born in the same year as Robb and Jon, and we know nothing whatsoever about her mother. We've assumed up to this point that her mother is Howland's wife, Jyana, but we know nothing about this character except her name and that she exists (because Jojen has to come from somewhere, and I don't buy the theory that he's Howland in disguise). 
* Meera's physical description is very similar to Lyanna's and Arya's. She's slim and flat-chested, attractive without being traditionally beautiful. She's got the martial prowess that Lyanna had, and her cheerful but fiery personality is reminiscent of what we know about Lyanna.
* The odds of Lyanna dying in childbirth seem more likely if she had twins.
* Howland certainly owes Lyanna a debt, which we know thanks to the story of the Knight of the Laughing Tree. Him taking a second child and hiding it at Greywater Watch could certainly have happened in the time between the TOJ and Ned returning to Winterfell (Ned returning with TWO bastards would have been a real stretch, and having the children in the same place would have put them in much worse danger if their true parentage was discovered.). Is there a more perfect place to hide someone who doesn't want to be found than Greywater Watch?
* The northern houses that could propose marriage alliances with the Starks seemed to be at least interested (the Karstarks wanting to marry Alys to Robb), but despite Howland having a daughter of the exact same age, he shows zero interest in such an arrangement (Close friends/allies with children of the same age generally seem very interested in marrying their kids off to each other...but not here...).
* It gives the dragon a third head in a very ""neat"" way, which seems much more up Martin's alley than making Tyrion a bastard or having Bran warg into the third dragon.

Cons:

* The biggest hole in this theory, no doubt, is that Meera has green eyes. No Starks have green eyes (Lyanna and Jon both have gray eyes), and no recent Targaryens have had green eyes either (1/2 of Shiera Seastar doesn't count). However, wouldn't giving Meera gray (or violet) eyes give this away way too soon? Howland Reed knows some magic thanks to his time on the Isle of Faces, and crannogmen have been described as being able to ""blend in"" to the neck. Changing her eye color to throw the readers off the scent isn't something I'd put past Martin, if he really wanted this to be a surprise.
* She doesn't show up in any of the prophecies. There's no foreshadowing or prophecy that mentions twins (AFAIK). 
* Bloodraven or the COTF might sense her importance (she's in their cave, after all), but if she seems significant to them, they aren't showing it. 
* She's short (which I don't remember being particular of Lyanna), but could this be a byproduct of growing up in the (presumably cramped) Neck? 
* If she's stuck in that cave north of the wall when winter hits, how is she going to become relevant to the story anytime soon? No easy answer here.

So that's my theory. There is certainly solid evidence against it, but I don't think any of the cons are enough to completely, 100%, rule it out. Thoughts?

So I was looking in my copy of Lands of Ice and Fire the other day and for whatever reason I happened to focus on the Summer Islands. The name of the Island that contains the Red Flower Vale is called Jhala.


This would mean that Jhalabar Xho is from Jhala; at first I thought that was stupid. I mean, this would be like Paxter Redwyne naming his son ""Arborbar Redwyne"". But then I thought about it for a while; what if Jhalabar **isn't** a first name?


What if Jhalabar is what he is called as an exile? His name is actually Xho, but when he leaves the Summer Isles, a Prince from Jhala, everyone starts calling him, ""The Jhalabar"", i.e., the guy from Jhala.


Now, in our world, in Aramaic, ""bar"" means ""son ; as in Bar Mitzvah, or Jesus' patronymic, Bar Joseph (not actually Christ...). GRRM has gotta know this detail- the man's from the East coast...


Now, we've heard about some Valyrian bastards, but we haven't seen a bastard naming system for The East; feasibly it should be something as elaborate as a new last name per where they were born, like in Westeros. My theory is that in the ASOIAF universe, ""bar"" in a name is the Valyrian way denoting bastards. 


There are two Westerosi houses with ""bar"" in their names. The first is House Bar Emmon. We know almost nothing about them, save for they are a small house in Blackwater Bay (on the tip of Massey's Hook) sworn to Dragonstone. My theory is the Bar Emmons came to Westeros with the Targareyns and the Velaryons. Being led by a bastard out of The Doom, House Bar Emmon had no prestigious member, like Aegon Targareyn or Daemon Velaryon, so their house exists, but is rather small and obscure to this day. Perhaps they have the Valyrian look, but there's too little info about them to know. 


The other ""bar"" house is another Valyrian name: Baratheon. We know Orys Baratheon was a bastard. I'd venture to guess when he took the Storm Land's he agglutinated his name from Bar Atheon to Baratheon, as to wipe away his bastard name from his new line of Lords of Storm's End. 


So if ""bar"" is the Valyrian bastard modifier, what does this mean for Jhalabar Xho? 


He's in King's Landing now, but [look at the map](http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e4/Werthead/Maps/WorldofIceandFireNamesandScale_zps2aecc8fb.png). In traveling from The Summer Isle's to King's Landing, Xho would have to pass through at least Tyrosh, possibly Lys. Let's say at the beginning of his exile, he goes to the Free Cities, looking for mercenaries to help him take the Red Flower Vale. The mercenary companies of Lys and Tyrosh have more pressing matters to deal with, like the Disputed Lands, so they send Xho away, not before giving him a new and disparaging nickname, ""Jhalabar Xho"", or, ""Xho, the bastard of Jhala"".


He makes it to King's Landing to petition Party-King Robert to drink with him, *then* give him an army. But by the time Xho reaches Westeros, his reputation proceeds him; he is already known to King Robert's court as Jhalabar Xho. Now the King will keep him in his company, which is the first step to taking back The Red Flower Vale; if he get's an army, it doesn't matter what name they call him. At that point, and especially because the Westerosi don't understand that it's a rude nickname, he's cool with being called Jhalabar. 


**tl;dr** Jhalabar Xho is not his given name- he is Xho from the Island of Jhala. If  Bar is the Valyrian bastard modifier; ""Jhalabar"" (the bastard of Jhala) is a derogatory nickname he picked up in the Free Cities. 

**edit** A couple people are asking if Jhalabar is his family name, but comes first, as in East Asian names. I had considered that, but I'd think the evidence against it Quhuru Mo and his daughter Kojja Mo; as far as I can tell, family names come last in the Summer Islands.

If the rock was barren it would explain:

*The ambitious hunger to acquire political power rather than just bask in material wealth. Once they have political power, it would be easier to weather their poverty. Tywin speaks at length about leaving a legacy, and being the richest family in Westeros is not enough?

*The seeming stinginess in lending the throne more money or paying for the royal wedding. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't the Lannisters also come from a mythic figure in Westerosi history, the same way the Starks came from Bran The Builder? It was a witty, puck/trickster being, and we know how much they love deceit. Perhaps all Lannister gold is fool's gold.

Varys insinuates that he believes another man is responsible. Another man, behind the scenes.

&gt;Varys smiled. “Here, then. Power resides where men believe it resides. No more and no less.”
“So power is a mummer’s trick?”
“A shadow on the wall,” Varys murmured, “yet shadows can kill. And ofttimes a *very small man* can cast a very large shadow.”
Tyrion smiled. “Lord Varys, I am growing strangely fond of you. I may kill you yet, but I think I’d feel sad about it.”
“I will take that as high praise.”

Tyrion, in his conceit and self-satisfaction, immediately assumes this ""very small man"" to be him. The show furthers his conceit, making it seem as if Varys is referring to him. The small man Varys speaks of is Littlefinger, whom we suspect to have whispered in Joffrey's ear, setting the wheels in motion for Ned's exectution. 

While not a revolutionary find, I love this passage because of the ships-passing-in-the-night feel. Tyrion, smug as he is, thinks himself on par with the true master.

1335832141.0,305,self.asoiaf,t0oxf,(Speculation ADWD) Birth of the Old Gods,myzteryz,373,68,169,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/t0oxf/speculation_adwd_birth_of_the_old_gods/,"One thing about Bran and the Three-Eyed Crow seemed to click for me for the first time today.  I always understood that Bran's role in the story was to become a powerful Greenseer, and that the Greenseers had a connection with the Wierwood Trees of the Godswood.  

Furthermore, even though I hadn't thought much of it during my first read of A Dance With Dragons, it seems to make sense that the Wierwood Paste is made from a combination of Wierwood seeds and the blood of Jojen Reed.  

The part that only started to make sense now is that the Wierwood Paste is so named for the fact that it turn the person consuming it into a Wierwood tree.  This is why the Three-Eyed Crow (who himself will most likely turn out to be Brynden Rivers) has lived such a long life in his suspended half-man half-tree state.  

But the Three-Eyed Crow is a character who lives in isolation, guarded by one of the last children of the forest.  It makes sense that in earlier times the powerful Greenseers in a community would retreat to the Godswood to meditate and focus on expanding the scope of their vision.  I'm sure they would also seek out the blood of a sacrifice to combine with Weirwood seeds, which once consumed would help that Greenseer begin their own transformation into a Weirwood tree.

Nevertheless, I can only imagine that these Greenseers in half-man half-tree form would be sought out by other children of the forest who did not possess the gift of greensight, yet who were looking for the advice or wisdom of those who did.  

Therefore, as we see Northerners going to pray in the Godswood out of habit, it is entirely possible that the Old Gods they were praying to were nothing more than the wise men of the earlier communities who devoted their lives to Greenseeing.  Over time these Greenseers became more Weirwood tree than human, but so long as there were other living Greenseers, some living person could see through the eyes of the Wierwood tree and offer their council to those who sought it.  But as the children of the forest were killed off, and fewer and fewer were taught the gift of greenseeing, there was no way for anyone to communicate to those who came to pray to the Weirwood trees.  After a certain point those who sought the council of the Weirwood trees were no longer given answers from the Greenseers, but had their questions only answered with the silence of the forest.  The Weirwood trees, which still bear faces, are the barely sentient husks of those early Greenseers who have been forgotten as men and remembered as the Old Gods of an earlier era.  

EDIT: Thanks for the huge response.  Also, props to Benevolent_Overlord for finding the passage that backs up much of this theory.  It's in spoiler text, so I won't copy it here, but it's worth reading. 

There are a number of questions over whether the Old Gods are prior to the Greenseers, or if there were Wierwood trees before the arrival of Greenseers.  Of course, only GRRM is going to answer with these questions with any finality, but I'll offer my own speculation:

I think that the Children of The Forest had a reverence for nature before anyone discovered the gift of Green Sight.  I'd imagine that the first Greenseer was a Buddah like figure who went out to an area in the forest to mediate, and discovered that he or she could see through the eyes of certain animals, or predict future events.  The gift of Greensight then, is an innate power that some Children of the Forest have that somehow needs to be awakened.  

Somehow, this first Greenseer was given the blood of a sacrifice to expand their powers and even though the blood enhanced their power, it started to rob them of their more human side and caused them to physically transform.  This first Greenseer then became the first Weirwood tree.

pilinisi notes that the weir in Weirwood is linguistically similar to the were in werewolf, and that we should assume that the term Weirwood holds the connotation that a human has transformed into wood.  

My guess is that this first Greenseer was sought out by others as a teacher/man of wisdom like the Buddah, or Jesus, or a prophetic figure like the Oracle at Delphi.  Before the first Greenseer became more tree than man, the Children of the Forest would go to him or her for seeking guidance and wisdom.  After the first Greenseer became more tree than man he was worshiped by the Children of the Forest as the first God.  Later Greenseers would take the seeds of the Weirwood tree, and the blood of a sacrifice as sacrament, and go off to meditate in a new forest, where they would learn to communicate with the Old God, and the animals.  

From the perspective of the books, we see the Northmen of 300AL praying before the Weirwood trees seeking guidance from the Old Gods.  But in this time the Greenseers are all but extinct, so no one answers their prayers.  These Northmen like Eddard Stark have to find guidance in the silence of the Old Gods.  So we say that the Northmen are hard men who pray to a hard god.  

I'm suggesting that what we're seeing is a people who are carrying on the traditions of the Children of The Forest, who prayed to the Weirwood Trees and often got the answers they sought from the powerful Greenseers who could communicate their wisdom through those trees.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,True,,ManwoodyOfKingsgrave,True,t3_t0oxf,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/t0oxf/speculation_adwd_birth_of_the_old_gods/,

Is this ludicrous to anyone else, besides me? Sandor is, if he is still alive, a crippled man. He has no idea and no proof that his undead brother could be walking around in Kings Landing. The idea that he would just suddenly up and leave the quiet Isle to pit his recently diminished self against a recently upgraded version of his brother is stupid. Just stupid. After having just found peace with himself he would not just throw his life away in what he must know, and what the elder brother would tell him, is a lost and hopeless cause. As much as I know people would like to see this happen, and as neat an idea it is for the brothers to finally have their fight, this simply will not be. My Theory, which is something that I saw echoed here the other day is that the faith, or more specifically, the high septon, will insist on Lancel lannister fighting this battle. He is the only person who in addition to supporting the claims of cersei's adultery has provided evidence to her kingslaying. Osney provided evidence to the deicide but I would think that the faith has broken him to the point where they would not have him as their champion, especially considering they're putting him to death for his crimes anyway.

1364569936.0,297,self.asoiaf,1b8tum,(Spoilers All) Euron's Master Plan,ttmlkr,364,67,166,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1b8tum/spoilers_all_eurons_master_plan/,"So its commonly stated on here that Euron is using Victarion as a pawn, and it typically involves the Dragonhorn given to him. I have a theory (with minimum tin foil required) about Euron's goals and his overall plan. I have a few parameters for my theory:

- The first thing that needs to be accepted is the Euron-Faceless Men theory, or else this will all fall apart. 

- Next, GRRM has stated Vic is as dumb as we think he is. Thus, if he thinks of something, then Euron has already thought of it twice.

Alright, here we go.

Euron recruited the Faceless Men to kill Balon after he escaped from the ruins of Valyria. He has plenty of riches and rare treasures, but the only thing that the FM want is the dragon egg. Why? Well for one thing, Dany just went and hatched three dragon eggs in the East. Also, the FM have their origins in the slaves of Valyria; the last thing they want to see is the dragonlords becoming powerful again. They demand the dragon egg as payment from Euron so they can destroy it. But this is all familiar territory right? Lets move on.

Euron claims the Seastone chair due to the help of the FM, and begins to fulfill his aspriations for conquest. He realizes how powerful the FM are as an ally, and approaches them for further help (perhaps with people such as the Damphair). They ignore him, as he no longer has anything of interest to them. However, he promises them the death of dragons in return. No, not the book sitting in a vault in Oldtown, but the actual death of dragons. How? Let's take a look at Victarion and the horn that Euron sent with them.

Euron sends Vic with a horn that can control dragons to Meereen so he can claim Dany as Euron's bride. For a man who sailed into Valyria and back, that's a pretty stupid plan. Let's break it down:

- Euron sends Vic. Why would he send Vic, the man whose wife he raped, to go claim him a new wife? He must know that Vic is going to try to betray him in some way, either by taking Dany/the Dragons as his own. 

- With such a risk of betrayal, it just doesn't fit that he would give Vic a weapon so powerful as the horn. On that note, isn't it a little convenient that a horn with the ability to control dragons has just made its way to a location where dragons are being unruly? It just doesn't fit with the series. It's too straightforward, simple, and non-convoluted. 

- It's also worth noting that ""All Euron's gifts are poisoned.""

- If Euron wants to claim a wife at all, why is he sending his brother in his stead? Won't that come off as cowardly and weak to the *Mother of Dragons*? Unless he doesn't want to marry Dany at all...

... But wants to kill her dragons. Think about it. Why else would Euron send a person that despises him, to claim a bride who won't take him, with a weapon/tool that has some effect on dragons. Euron sends an unknowing Vic to blow the horn, which will in turn (1) Kill the dragons or (2) severely incapacitate them or (3) Drive them insane. Either way, the end result will still be the same: Victarion will likely die, and Rhaegal/Viserion are taken out, thus when Dany returns she will think the Iron Fleet was sent specifically to kill her dragons. She now has a reason to get her ass in gear and get to Westeros. All the while Euron sits on his throne, laughing as the alliance with the Faceless Men is secured. Also, its pretty convenient that the FM have agents ready in Oldtown right as Euron is attacking the Reach... If Euron's plan succeed I can see the FM helping him take Oldtown. This conspiring would also provide a path for Arya back to Westeros, while still being a part of the FM.

 Also didn't Moqorro say that ""A tall and twisted thing with one black eye and ten long arms, sailing on a sea of blood"" was the greatest danger to Dany? What greater danger would there be other than her dragons being killed? Curious, very curious.

I'll end with these quotes from Euron's wiki:

""I am the storm, my lord. The first storm, and the last.""

""Perhaps we can fly. All of us. How will we ever know unless we leap from some tall tower? No man ever truly knows what he can do unless he dares to leap.""


TLDR - Euron wants to ally with FM after they kill Balon for him, so he promises to kill Dany's dragons. He plans on doing so by tricking Vic into thinking the horn will bind the dragons when it will actually kill/incapacitate them. He then uses his alliance with FM to help take Oldtown/the Reach, while Dany seeks revenge for the death of her dragons and finally leaves for Westeros.

I think it would feel haphazard and lazy to have two secret Targs conveniently jump out of nowhere (and I think R+L=J is more sensible). That said, as someone who is adopted, there is an argument that almost always gets brought up when people explain why they hate it, and it always drives me crazy.

Namely, people say Tyrion's biological paternity being anyone but Tywin negates any issues he has with being Tywin's son, and takes away a lot of the drama and struggles he has with his family. No, it doesn't. I'm sorry, but Tywin is still the man who raised Tyrion and called him son, however reluctantly he did that, and Tyrion has often strived for Tywin's approval and love, no matter what his DNA says. People tell me I have my mother's laugh and that I'm stubborn like my father, and it's true, because they are the ones who raised me. And I hate to see family be brushed aside, as if who raised, clothed, and cared for you, however poorly Tywin did those things, means nothing.

You can argue that genetics are more important in the ASOIAF world than they are in ours - I've had people tell me that (the whole ""the seed is strong"" thing). But even the strongest believer in R+L=J would readily admit that, where it matters, Ned Stark is Jon Snow's father, in fact as well as spirit, for better or for worse. 

I certainly hope that Tyrion does not turn out to be the illegitimate child of Aerys for many reasons, but if the series goes there, then it does not make anyone's statements about Tyrion's relationship with his family any more true or false.

**IX. WAR OF THE SEXES**
&gt;Each of the Seven embodies all of the Seven...There was as much beauty in the Crone as in the Maiden, and the Mother could be fiercer than the Warrior when her children were in danger (ACOK 33/Catelyn IV).

Brienne didn't have to spend much time in Catelyn Stark's company before realizing that Cat was as brave as many knights (“...you have courage. Not battle courage perhaps but...a kind of woman’s courage. ACOK 39/Catelyn V). It was this courage, derived from Catelyn's motherhood, that led her to defend Bran from an assassin armed with Valyrian steel. Later, Catelyn tells Brienne about how motherhood is a kind of battle:

&gt;[Catelyn] “Knights die in battle”...

&gt;[Brienne] ...“As ladies die in childbed. No one sings songs about them.”

&gt;“Children are a battle of a different sort....A battle without banners or warhorns, but no less fierce. Carrying a child, bringing it into the world... your mother will have told you of the pain...”  (ACOK 45/Catelyn VI)

Perhaps this idea of motherhood being its own sort of battlefield is common in Westerosi society. Randyll Tarly said something similar while trying to force Brienne to leave Renly's camp: “The gods made men to fight, and women to bear children...A woman’s war is in the birthing bed"" (AFFC 14/Brienne III). As a warrior-maid, Brienne defies this strict division of labor. Her very body challenges the gender divide. She is taller and more muscular than many men. She cross-dresses. Podrick habitually calls her ""Ser/my lady"". 

Catelyn pitied Brienne's ugliness, ""Is there any creature on earth as unfortunate as an ugly woman?"" (ACOK 22/ Catelyn II). Beauty is a kind of currency in this world. Beautiful women will attract more suitors and more opportunities for social advancement for their families. Tywin Lannister hoarded Cersei as greedily as any miser, only consenting to sell her to a crown prince or king (ASOS 11/Jaime II). 

But beauty can be a double-edged sword for women, a trap that prevents them from being viewed as anything but ornamental and sexual objects. During the Battle of Blackwater, Cersei bitterly reflected on how her gender has condemned her to passivity and thus, vulnerability:

&gt;The queen’s face was hard and angry. “Would that I could take a sword to their necks myself....When we were little, Jaime and I were so much alike that even our lord father could not tell us apart. Sometimes as a lark we would dress in each other’s clothes and spend a whole day each as the other. Yet even so, when Jaime was given his first sword, there was none for me. ‘What do I get?’ I remember asking. We were so much alike, I could never understand why they treated us so differently. Jaime learned to fight with sword and lance and mace, while I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, while I was to be sold to some stranger like a horse, to be ridden whenever my new owner liked, beaten whenever he liked, and cast aside in time for a younger filly. Jaime’s lot was to be glory and power, while mine was birth and moonblood.”

&gt;“But you were queen of all the Seven Kingdoms,” Sansa said.

&gt;“When it comes to swords, a queen is only a woman after all.” (ACOK 60/Sansa VI)

Queen is the very highest social rank a woman in Westerosi society can attain, yet ultimately, a queen is nothing more than a glorified wife and mother. There's very little actual power in the position. Any influence the queen may have is derived from her husband or the power of her house. Being queen didn't prevent Rhaella and Cersei from being abused by their husbands. Being queen didn't prevent Elia from being raped and murdered by Gregor Clegane. Being queen didn't prevent Criston Cole and Aegon II from overthrowing and executing Rhaenyra. 

Though it's limited her life in certain ways, Brienne's ugliness has given her the opportunity to escape the constraints of womanhood. Men don't want her, so she is free from the cycle of birth and moonblood that trapped Cersei and so many other women. Brienne doesn't have to sit back and hope she and those she cares about won't be raped, tortured, or killed. She can fight if she wants to:

&gt;“Fighting is better than this waiting,” Brienne said. “You don’t feel so helpless when you fight. You have a sword and a horse, sometimes an axe. When you’re armored it’s hard for anyone to hurt you.”(ACOK 45/Catelyn VI)

Though she pitied Brienne for being so ugly, Cat also envied how comparatively straightforward her life is, ""It is simpler for her, Catelyn thought with a pang of envy. She was like a man in that. For men the answer was always the same, and never farther away than the nearest sword. For a woman, a mother, the way was stonier and harder to know"" (ACOK 45/Catelyn VI)

In this society, to be female is to be passive. Catelyn spent many days watching and waiting for Hoster Tully, Brandon Stark, and Ned Stark to return from war. Cersei was furious about being cooped up in Maegor's Holdfast with the ""hens"" while the Battle of Blackwater raged. It probably seemed ludicrous to her that she had to defer to her hated dwarf brother and pubescent son when it came to the defense of the city. In this society, women have to rely on men if they want to accomplish anything. 

In a martial society, passivity is vulnerability. It is part of a knight's sacred vows to protect women because they cannot protect themselves. But Sandor Clegane warned Sansa not to trust the songs about the selfless gallantry of knights:

&gt;""True knights protect the weak.”

&gt;[Sandor] snorted. “There are no true knights, no more than there are gods. If you can’t protect yourself, die and get out of the way of those who can. Sharp steel and strong arms rule this world, don’t ever believe any different.”

&gt;...“You’re awful.”

&gt;“I’m honest. It’s the world that’s awful (ACOK 52/Sansa IV).

[Knights are not the exemplars of chivalry that the songs and men like Barristan Selmy believe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dxv4m/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/) There are very few knights (or men) like Barristan the Bold. For the most part, knights are merely glorified soldiers: ""What do you think a knight is for, girl? You think it’s all taking favors from ladies and looking fine in gold plate? Knights are for killing"" (ACOK 52/Sansa IV). Sandor's rescue of Sansa from a mob of smallfolk is brutal and ugly, not romantic: 

&gt;She’d thought she was going to die then, but the fingers had twitched, all five at once, and the man had shrieked loud as a horse. When his hand fell away, another hand, stronger, shoved her back into her saddle. The man with the garlicky breath was on the ground, blood pumping out the stump of his arm, but there were others all around, some with clubs in hand. The Hound leapt at them, his sword a blur of steel that trailed a red mist as it swung. When they broke and ran before him he had laughed, his terrible burned face for a moment transformed. (ACOK 52/Sansa IV)

Unlike Brienne and Sansa, Cersei has no illusions about the nobility of knights--that's the stuff of children's tales:

&gt;“True knights would never harm women and children.” The words rang hollow in [Sansa's] ears even as she said them.

&gt;“True knights.” [Cersei] seemed to find that wonderfully amusing. “No doubt you’re right. So why don’t you just eat your broth like a good girl and wait for Symeon Star-Eyes and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight to come rescue you, sweetling. I’m sure it won’t be very long now.” (ACOK 57/Sansa V).

Like Sandor and his twin, Jaime did his best to disabuse a sheltered girl of her romantic notions of knighthood:

&gt;The crows had scarcely started on their corpses. The thin ropes cut deeply into the soft flesh of their throats, and when the wind blew they twisted and swayed. “This was not chivalrously done,” said Brienne...“No true knight would condone such wanton butchery.”

&gt;“True knights see worse every time they ride to war, wench,” said Jaime. “And do worse, yes.” (ASOS 1/Jaime I)

It made me wonder about Joffrey's relationship with his parents. So, I have some questions for you smart people in this subreddit. 

1. Did Joffrey believe the rumors about his parentage? Did he actually think Jaime was his father? Assuming he didn't believe the rumors, and then he learnt they were true, how would he react? Would he demand Jaime's head?

2. How did Joffrey view Robert Baratheon? I've heard some people say he glorified him, others say he hated him, and that sort of stuff. From what I understand, Robert was disappointed in Joffrey, and considering Joffrey tried to have Bran killed, he wanted Robert's approval. But really I wanna know more.

3. How would Joffrey react if he learnt that his mother was sleeping with, ""Lancel Lannister and Osmund Kettleback and Moon Boy for all I know""? He genuinely loves his mother and she loves him, but if he also glorified Robert, he probably wouldn't like his mother's partners either. Would he treat them well? Would he kill them like Tyrion is suggesting? What's the deal with that whole scenario?

1370875394.0,293,self.asoiaf,1g1oqe,(Spoilers All) Why we shouldn't be too worried about Stannis in the show,aphidman,358,65,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1g1oqe/spoilers_all_why_we_shouldnt_be_too_worried_about/,"I'm not an avid Stannis fan but I certainly find him to be one of the most interesting and enjoyable characters in the series. After rereading ASOS recently there were a few scenes, lines of dialogue that I would have preferred to be kept intact in Davos' storyline. (Mel meeting Davos in the dungeons etc)

Now, I see a lot of Stannis fans are disappointed in his portrayal in this weeks episode. Towards the end of ASOS Stannis utters these words to Jon Snow that highlight an important change in his character.

“Lord Seaworth is a man of humble birth, but he reminded me of my duty, when all I could think of was my rights. I had the cart before the horse, Davos said. I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne.”

Now, Davos neither utters those words in the books or the show. The only difference is that we do not see this scene in the books - it ends with Davos reading the letter from Aemon with his life at stake. In the show we see Stannis changing his mind.

Now, a lot of people hate the way D&amp;D chose to portray Stannis's reaction with this news. Before immediately choosing his new path he waits for Melisandre's counsel. They feel this makes him look as if he's only doing it because Melisandre says so - not because Davos said so and it is the right thing to do. So why do I think people shouldn't be worried? It is because this is the beginning of Stannis' redemption arc. It would not be keeping in line with the show's continuity to do a 180 on the character and have him completely ignore Melisandre's counsel or his determination to win the Iron Throne.

Now, in the books we never see how Stannis reacts to this news. We just know Davos is spared and Stannis goes to the Wall. At the wall he tells Jon what Davos said and how he had lost his way.

""I was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom, when I should have been trying to save the kingdom to win the throne.""

This is a great piece of dialogue and I hope D&amp;D use it but there's nothing to suggest that Stannis is not going to change as a character. He's not going to redeem himself and come to this realisation. I believe this will be an example of delayed characterisation. Just like Arya's murderous tendencies. It's not hard to imagine that, even in book canon, Stannis would seek Melisandre's advice on the matter since he's essentially given in to all her advice following the Battle of Blackwater. Sure, in the show he's a lot less hesitant to kill Gendry after Robb's death than Edric in the books. But the result is essentially the same.

If you completely disagree and think Stannis would not have bothered with Melisandre's counsel at that point in time - judging by his exchange with Jon Snow - then I still don't think there's been a character assassination. Most characters in the show have been altered somewhat in the adaptation - for good or for bad - and Stannis is no different. But really, the core of his character is not going to be thrown out the window.

Stannis comes to Jon and tells him how he was wrong during the War of the Five King's. That's what's important. That he comes to realise his greater purpose. That Davos was right. That he was misguided. This small exchange with Melisandre and Davos is not what's important. What's important is that Stannis changes as a character. He leaves the war as the bitter king fighting for his lawful duty to be King to the King Who Cared. That's what's important for Stannis's character and I think people should really hold off before throwing around ""character assassination"". Stannis needs a character arc and it makes no sense, at this stage in the show, to give him the 180 treatment.

Let's see where the show takes him and hopefully by the end of next season we get to see the Stannis that fan's love (or hate).

On a side note, I know a lot of people use the interview with D&amp;D to justify their opinions but I think that's too strong a reaction. There's nothing to suggest that Stannis *would* be a great ruler. It's a very debatable issue and D&amp;D obviously think he wouldn't be as good as Renly. It isn't a lack of understanding of the character but simply an opinion. They think Renly would be better. So do many other fans. We'll never actually know since GRRM never had Renly or pre-Blackwater Stannis win the throne and rule the Seven Kingdoms.

Also, D&amp;D mention his desire to have the Throne which fans disagree with. That's not too unreasonable. Deep down Stannis doesn't exactly wish to be King but this is not the situation he's in and he certainly has a desire to win the Throne at any cost.

But anwyay, yes, show Stannis is not book Stannis. Just like nearly every other character in the show. But I think people who love Stannis need to be patient. We'll more or less get that character in the future. We'll never get a 100% faithful adaptation of the character so I know that some fans will never be satisfied with his portrayal but I think we'll get there. Just like we're getting a more murderous Arya. Just like we'll get a more politically savvy Sansa.


Just like we'll get a more jovial Tormund!!

**tl;dr - Character progress with Stannis is slow, not 1:1 with the books, but I'm hopeful we'll get there and you shouldn't be too worried - if you want details read above and disagree accordingly**

She's not walking anywhere, drinking way too much, and I'd have to double check her eating comments but there are pointers there too. There is also comment (from her perspective) about dresses being shrunk by washer women (or are they) and a newly made one being tight across the belly. Two thoughts immediately leapt to mind.

1. She's just letting herself go and is oblivious to it. Body following mind on the downward spiral. Adds weight to why everbody starts to treat her differently.

2. Pregnancy. Now there are monthly reminders to a woman that mean this is unlikely, but then maybe not if she's so distracted and self-absorbed. Jaime did finish with her in the Sept, and if I recall came into the world clutching her foot - so her little brother, if only by seconds. And a pregnancy would really leave her in trouble given where ADWD left her story.

“One of Lady Maege’s daughters, Sire. The youngest. She was named for my lord father’s sister.”
“To curry your lord father’s favor, I don’t doubt. I know how that game is played. How old is this wretched girl child?”
Jon had to think a moment. “Ten. Or near enough to make no matter. Might I know how she has offended Your Grace?”
Stannis read from the letter. “ ‘Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is STARK.’ A girl of ten, you say, and she presumes to scold her lawful king.”


This passage is one of my favourite passages in Dance. Just to think of a little girl telling of *Stannis Baratheon* is hilarious.

1370522769.0,289,self.asoiaf,1fsc5l,(Spoilers All) - Don't hate the player ...,Lord_Varys,350,61,196,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fsc5l/spoilers_all_dont_hate_the_player/,"I am halfway through *Dance* on my first re-read, and I've been paying closer attention to a lot of the subtleties.  At this point, it is crystal clear for me what is driving Littlefinger, and what his end-game is.  And though he has created ""evil"", I can at least start to see why...

His whole life is driven by love (obsession, maybe) for Catelyn Stark.  He suffered a trauma when he was younger, and it drives him.  Think of him like Batman - he lost someone he loved when he was younger, and it drives his actions for the rest of his life.  He loved a girl who was too high-born for him, and she denied him (*had to deny him*, in his eyes) for that reason.  To Petyr Baelish, the very system of Lords and Ladies, crowns and kings, knights and serfs - the Game of Thrones itself is responsible for this tragedy.  To him, this is a trauma on the scale of Romeo and Juliet.  Two people love eachother, but the very world they live in will not allow them to be together.

So what is his goal?  To tear that world apart.  To create chaos.  He will never, ever be able to win the game - he is too low born.  Honestly - who thinks that Petyr's goal is to sit the Iron Throne?  No, in his mind, the game fucked him.  So now he means to destroy the game.

And what better way to accomplish that goal than from the inside?  What will he do, storm the gates of King's Landing by himself?  No, he is a metaphorical Frodo, sneaking into the heart of darkness, disguised as ""one of them"", only to tear the very foundations of that world apart.  It is a brilliant strategy, an ingenous means for accomplishing what is to him a morally justified end - vengeance.

He walks around with a mocking-bird pinned to his chest.  Every time he interacts with a high-born lord or lady at court, he is laughing in their face.  ""You take yourselves *so* seriously, but this is all just a joke, a farce.""  He has nothing but contempt for the game, and therefore thinks next to nothing of the players.  He finds himself morally absolved from all the evil he creates - the game itself is evil, and you only have yourself to blame for playing it.

His whole world changes when he meets Sansa.  When he first meets her, he sees Cat again.  He is visibly shocked.  A normally well-spoken man is dumbfounded, at a loss for words.  This young girl *is* Catelyn Tully - the one completely changed his life.  They look nearl yidentical.  Now that he is in a position of power, he has a second, better chance to win the woman he loves.  He doesn't want Sansa.  He wants Catelyn - 13 year old Catelyn Tully.  That is what Sansa represents.  A chance for vindication.

So now his goal has moved, but the path to it remains the same.  Undermine the game.  This is all some game of monopoly that he's forced to watch, but he's slowly cutting away at the legs which hold the table up.  So he engineered the purple wedding, and through that chaos, he achieves two goals.  First, he takes Sansa.  Second, he continues to undermine the game.

Good, evil, in-between, who can say.  Obviously, he has selfish intentions when it comes to Sansa.  Daenerys, in one of her earlier *Game of Thrones* chapters, mentions how in all of the books and tales she read, you can tell that a man is evil because his eyes are always shifting, strange.  When Sansa meets Petyr, she notes that he smiled with his mouth but not his eyes.  Petyr then continues to eye her awkwardly on his way through the bedding ceremony with Lysa in *Storm of Swords*.  We have every reason to believe he has selfish intentions with Sansa, but again, in his mind, this is revenge.  For all of the evil he created (by lying to Catelyn about ""Tyrion's"" dagger, he essentially set off the chain of events in this series), I simply cannot hate this man.  Based on his experience, the game itself is evil.  He must tear it down, and if you happen to be taken down with it, well, you are to blame for participating in a fundamentally flawed exercise in governance.  

**TL;DR**  The Baelish House Words are:  *""Don't hate the player, hate the game""*

*edit: formatting*

**edit 2: Everyone needs to let go of the Batman reference.**  It is an example that only goes so far - a child is traumatized and he takes that trauma with him for the rest of his life, defining his actions.  That's at far as it goes.  Littlefinger cares nothing for the common good like our caped crusader does.

Littlefinger could be likened more closely to a jihadist, to be honest.  Imagine you life in Pakistan and your family is killed by a drone when you are young.  The rest of your life might be hell-bent on destroying the system that caused you this pain.  Maybe you think it's capitalism.  Maybe you think it's America.  Whatever it is, you will try to take it down, and the people who support it (taxpayers, consumers, etc.)

Now that I've cleared that up, let me also say that **absolutely none of this absolves Littlefinger or a terrorist from blame**.  I should not have said that ""I don't fault him for it.""  If there are gods in Westeros, then Petyr Baelish will surely be suffering through hell when he is dead.  Killing innocents is not justified.

This wasn't meant to defend Littlefinger.  It was to get inside his head.  He is a very intriguing character.  A tragic one, even.  He is as close as it gets to a criminal mastermind in Westeros - an evil genius.  And it is all the more poetic when you ask yourself *why*, and try to look at things from his perspective.  None of it is *irrational*, it is merely self-serving behavior rooted in the illusion that Catelyn loved him.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1370551991.0,,empty,True,t3_1fsc5l,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fsc5l/spoilers_all_dont_hate_the_player/,

1365681127.0,286,self.asoiaf,1c4ns4,(Spoilers All) Have We Already Been Told What the Others Are?,hamishwilson,359,73,297,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1c4ns4/spoilers_all_have_we_already_been_told_what_the/,"Now, I've seen plenty of discussions concerning the origin of the Others, ranging from them being warped-CoTF to a completely different entity, separate from humans and the CoTF. What I haven't seen discussed is something that stems from a couple of clues, from both the books and HBO series. 

The first clue is the second Sam chapter from ASoS. After Lord Commander Mormont bites it and gets his face happily pecked by a crow, there's chaos in Craster's Keep. Gilly wants to leave with Sam, but he is unsure of her safety, until he is warned by an old wife of Craster that *they* are coming. When Sam asks who they are she replies:
&gt;""The boy's brothers"", said the old woman on the left. ""Craster's sons""
ASoS (p. 460).

To me that is a huge hint. Whenever I try to explain this theory to my friends and they aren't buying it, I'll screech this quote until I black out. That old woman has been north of the wall her entire life, which has probably been pretty long compared to other wildlings. We know that Craster has no sons; maybe some are killed by Craster himself to stop any sort of future power struggle, maybe some died in childbirth. But we definitely know, from this quote, that some have been taken away by the Others. Why else would that old woman make that connection? She must have known of dozens of Craster's sons who have been taken by the Others, she's so confident that *that is what they are*, there's no hesitation. 

The second clue is from the TV show, and you probably know what it is. The scene where Jon witnesses an Other taking Craster's son away. If this scene doesn't meld perfectly with the passage I previously mentioned  then I'm George Martin, the record producer. We know that the HBO series cherry picks what it wants the viewer to see, and they wanted us to see that. The Other doesn't grab the baby by his head, or by his leg. He's not slung over it's shoulder in haste and hostility; he is very gently, very *caringly* picked up and held in the (m)Others arms (sorry I had to). 

So, you all know what I'm getting at now. I believe that the Others are humans that have been turned into whatever they are now. I'm not saying that ALL the Others are Craster's sons, just that probably quite a lot of them are. Think about it, Craster had been living in that location for a long time and, I'm not sure where it is (maybe someone could help me), but I'm sure a character (possibly in the show or book) questions how Craster could have survived that long. Easily, make a deal with the Others, 'I'll give you some boys to bolster your numbers, and you can make sure me and my wives don't die'. 
I believe that little baby is currently front row in a workshop titled 'How to be an Other 101'

My own little tinfoily theory is that they are priests, like the red priests. And like the red priests buy children, the Others take them.
Anyway, criticism is welcome, as it always should be.

I'm sort of new to this subbreddit, so sorry if this has been brought up before. Just wanted to share something that impacted me with some fellow readers and fans that may appreciate it, and see if you had a similar experience.

I just finished reading the series. I saw the show first. I love them both in different ways, but that's a whole 'nother discussion.

I hear a lot of people citing phrases from the books as inspirational/motivational mottos in their real lives. The most stunning example I've seen was a post over in r/gameofthrones where a young man who went into cardiac arrest (and was clinically DEAD) for hours was revived. He opted to have ""Not Today"" tattooed over his heart. It really moved me. 

As for me, while not being as severe a story as his, I had my own life impacted from the ASOIAF world. I think it's a line that's probably not very memorable to others, as it is very small and seemingly insignificant sentence.

It's when Dany asks Barriston Selmy about Rhaegar. She was trying to understand more of who he was as a person. I've forgotten the exact lines of context leading up to it, but the line that struck me most in the whole series was ""But I am not certain it was in Rhaegar to be happy.""

For a long time I've struggled with depression in my life. A lot of events in my personal life, involving loved ones and the tragedies we see in life, sent me into a very low and dismal state for a long time. Without divulging too much or being verbose, I was really down. 

And then I read that line.

It really struck me. It made me take hold of myself and made me think about what happiness was. Its not something that happens TO you. It's sourced within. It comes FROM yourself. 

Now, whenever I find myself feeling sad or depressed, I ask myself, ""is it in you to be happy?"" Like a mantra, it focuses me to rethink my place in the world and the way my mind works.



TL;DR, ASOIAF made me reexamine what happiness means because of Selmy's line about Rhaegar. 

My question to y'all is this:
Is there something, a quote or line or action, that has effected your life in a deep or meaningful way? I'd like to know. Thank you.

Maybe it's just me but I find but the actions of the crannogmen during the War of Five Kings, and on into its aftermath in ADWD, absolutely amazing. They're not traditional warriors, meaning they'd be of little help in the fields of the Riverlands/Westerlands/non-Neck North, but they sent their lord's two heirs to swear banners to The King In The North, and when Robb passes down orders, well, fuck if the crannogmen don't stick to them.

The collected leadership of the north was slaughtered at the Red Wedding, along with a huge portion of their armies. The Riverlords have run back to their castles, and Riverrun is surrounded by a massive seige force. The ironborn are raiding the north, and the traitorous Boltons are consolidating power, bringing the other northern houses to heel. Cowering before the the Iron Throne, most of the north falls in line. 

But not the crannogmen. Their king told them to hold The Neck, so that's what they fucking do. They don't give up; they don't slink back to Greywater Watch and tell Howie that the north is through. They do what they can, despite being unsuited for the straight-up fight most Westerosi prefer. When the ironborn come, they make life a swampy hell for them. When Roose Bolton's army passes through Moat Cailin, he uses a decoy and hides in a covered wagon, for fear of being surprised by a poisoned dart to the dome. They fought on after everyone else, and when they let the turncoat Boltons and Freys pass, it was out of tactical shrewdness.

Sure the crannogmen couldn't throw back the Bolton forces, but I can't imagine they're taking this lying down. The Reeds have an ancient and abiding loyalty to the Starks, and Howland Reed bears great love for his departed friend Eddard. The crannogmen are out there waiting and, though they may dwell in their bogs amongst the flies and snakes and lizard lions, they're still Northmen after all, and the north remembers.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1360205853.0,,WhentOfHarrenhal,True,t3_180wis,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/180wis/spoilers_all_crannogmen_an_appreciation/,

In the story of the Knight of the Laughing Tree, Meera makes Howland Reed out to be a pretty mystical character, talking about how he learned all the old magic of the Crannogmen and when he was done there, he went to the Isle of Faces to learn all he could from the Green People. Surely, all this training in the magic of the Children of the Forest must have paid off.

I'm thinking that it did and in big ways. I think it's possible that Howland Reed had the most influential and important green dream in the history of Westeros and set the Song of Ice and Fire in motion. Howland saw the long winter that is coming and he also saw the only way to save the world from the Others. He needed to attend that Tournament at Harrenhall so Lyanna could save him from the squires and enter the tournament as the Knight of the Laughing Tree. Who knows if this is what caught Rhaegar's attention but the next day after the mystery knight is gone and Rhaegar, who is commissioned with the task of identifying this knight, comes back empty handed, he crowns Lyanna the Queen of Love and Beauty, thus setting the Song of Ice and Fire in motion. None of this would have happened had Howland Reed not showed up to this specific tournament and been bullied by those specific squires.

So I'm proposing that Howland Reed saw the fate of Westeros without Rhaegar and Lyanna's child, knew what he had to do, and did it to make sure this match was secured. I think that's why we haven't seen him at all too. Howland Reed could very well have an idea of how the entire war with the Others will turn out. So much so, that he attended this one tournament to ensure that the war would not be lost by helping to deliver the prince that was promised.

DESTRIERS

* Large, powerful horses used to carry knights into battle. Destriers were very expensive and rather rare; only knights of high birth and stature owned them. Destriers were usually stallions, trained from a young age to withstand the rigors of battle. They were fast, strong, and intelligent. An example of a horse that would fit the destrier category would be a [Friesian.](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/145/7/7/Friesian_stallion_beache2_by_lifaya.jpg)

PALFREYS

* Long limbed, graceful horses used for general riding by nobility. Palfreys were chosen for their smooth, comfortable gait (known as [ambling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambling) if anyone's interested). Palfreys were also very expensive, and a well bred palfrey was highly prized. An example of a palfrey would be either the [Paso Fino](http://horsebreedsinfo.com/images/Paso_Fino.jpg) or the [American Saddlebred](http://modernsporthorses.com/img/jasluca.jpg?60).

COURSERS

* Light, strong, speedy horses capable of carrying a fully armoured knight into battle. More preferred for battle than a destrier for most knights, as destriers are crazy expensive. Courser is really a very general term, and can be applied to any well bred horse fast and strong enough for battle. An example of a courser would be an [American Quarter Horse](http://www.best-horse-photos.com/images/Wild_Quarter_Horse.jpg) (I say quarter horse because they're used for herding cattle and are quick, agile and strong, good battle qualities).

ROUNSEY

* Basic riding horse, often used as a pack animal or a mount for hedge knights, men at arms and squires. Reliable and strong, but not specially trained or highly bred. An example of a rounsey would be an [Australian Stock Horse](http://southernson.com/photos/nsw/border_ranges_national_park/australian_stock_horse_1bb.jpg).

GARRON

* Small, sturdy, strong horses or ponies suited to extreme weather and terrain. Garrons can take on mountains like a goat, and have no problems with snow. An example of a garron would be a [Highland Pony](http://www.somis.dundee.ac.uk/~amdouglas/winter.gif) (these guys have their winter coats, which is why they're so shaggy).

ZORSE

* It's a zebra. [Duh.](http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-live/photos/000/007/cache/zebra_764_600x450.jpg)


SAND STEED

* Fast, light, small horses used for desert travel. Sand steeds are native to Dorne, and can run for a day and a night without stopping. They require little water, and tolerate extreme heat well. An example of a sand steed would the [Arabian](http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/vikarus/vikarus1005/vikarus100500008/6938324-white-arabian-horse-running-gallop-on-the-meadow.jpg) or the [Akhal Teke](http://horsebreedslist.com/horse_breed_images/60/big/akhal-teke-picture-2.jpg).

STOT

* Worthless horse. Generally old and overworked, often [swaybacked](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_SGy6jIXdDDw/RxNE4fNFg8I/AAAAAAAAAIg/Z8YoqKzbPxE/s320/Els20Aug05.jpg). Can be any breed, any type.

1366124354.0,285,self.asoiaf,1cgpb1,(Spoilers All) About the Others...,frogma,323,38,360,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1cgpb1/spoilers_all_about_the_others/,"I mentioned this in a comment, but also wanted to make a post so we can all be on the same page. First, here are some quotes from GRRM:

&gt;""In real life, the hardest aspect of the battle between good and evil is determining which is which.""

&gt;""Much as I admire Tolkien, and I do admire Tolkien... there are things about it, the whole concept of the Dark Lord, and good guys battling bad guys, Good versus Evil, while brilliantly handled in Tolkien, in the hands of many Tolkien successors, it has become kind of a cartoon. We don’t need any more Dark Lords, we don’t need any more, ‘Here are the good guys, they’re in white, there are the bad guys, they’re in black. And also, they’re really ugly, the bad guys.""

&gt;""We all have good in us and we all have evil in us, and we may do a wonderful good act on Tuesday and a horrible, selfish, bad act on Wednesday, and to me, that’s the great human drama of fiction. I believe in gray characters, as I’ve said before. We all have good and evil in us and there are very few pure paragons and there are very few orcs. A villain is a hero of the other side, as someone said once, and I think there’s a great deal of truth to that, and that’s the interesting thing. In the case of war, that kind of situation, so I think some of that is definitely what I’m aiming at.""

I know there was another quote that seemed to be a more direct reference to the Others, but it's hard to find it. Anyway, now for some actual scenes with the Others:

&gt;Behind him, to right, to left, all around him, the watchers stood patient, faceless, silent, the shifting patterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood. Yet they made no move to interfere.

Ser Waymar's fighting one of them, while the *other* Others just stand and watch. They easily could've helped in the fight, but they chose not to. Then later:

&gt;The Other said something in a language that Will did not know; his voice was like the cracking of ice on a winter lake, and the words were mocking.

So they speak a language and openly mock Ser Waymar. Then later:

&gt;The Other's parry was almost lazy.

So they understand their own strength, to the point where they'll even be *lazy* in a fight, just because they feel like it. Then later:

&gt;Far beneath him, he heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles.

Again, openly mocking these people, and laughing about it.

So they're calculated enough to have a language, to pick the people they want to kill, to mock people, and to purposely be lazy in a fight just because they can. They also don't mind standing back and watching a one-on-one fight, again, just because they can.

At the very least, we can say the Others are fairly intelligent. They're not mindless, and based on some of GRRM's quotes, they might not even be purely evil. As to their endgame, who knows, but here's another interesting quote from GRRM:

&gt;""The Others are not dead. They are strange, beautiful… think, oh… the Sidhe made of ice, something like that… a different sort of life… inhuman, elegant, dangerous.""

There's far too much info about the Sidhe for me to give much of an explanation here, but here's the [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidhe) about them. The mythology is pretty interesting, and I have to wonder if GRRM was only making a shallow comparison, or if there's something more to it.

tl;dr -- I don't think the Others are purely evil, I think they're pretty damn intelligent, and I think they likely have a good reason for doing what they do. Hopefully the next book will shed more light on it.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,Stark,True,t3_1cgpb1,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1cgpb1/spoilers_all_about_the_others/,

While, the recent book made me feel sorry for him like I hadn't before, the show has added a level of depth to character that I didn't personally find while reading. The struggle in identity he is dealing with, his long/slow and painful downfall (made all the worse by knowing whats to come)... and most of all, Alfie Allen, have made Theon one of my favorite characters.

Alfie adds an emotional core to the character beyond the stuck up brattiness of the books. Even when the worse aspects of his character are evident, his eyes and posture betray his sadness. I can easily see him as the competent warrior, ladies man, and future broken pathetic creature that's to come. In a show filled with awesome performances, his is near the top IMHO.

ADWD was basically step one in sowing the seeds of her turn-around. I mean honestly, how many people were loathing Dany at the end of ADWD?

This is how I think it will go down:
She's already pissed about the near miss Drogon suffered.
Her other two dragons are loose in the city, she is going to get there just in time to see one of them go down. Or, she's going to get there and find the mangled corpse of her dragon/s in Meereen. This, combined with the constant thorn in her side that is the Sons of the Harpy, will get her to just snap and raze the city to the ground.

Then after that it's on the warpath to Westeros, with her massive army of Dothraki, Unsullied, Ironborne, and Freedmen cutting a bloody swathe from Dorne to the Wall.

Tyrion, ironically - will find himself in the same position as his father - serving as hand to a dangerous and maniacal tyrant, treading carefully with every word.

Jorah - put to the sword probably, or in some weird relationship with Dany, hell who knows here.

Victarion - put to the sword as well. Alternatively, Victarion will be the one to kill one of the dragon's with his horn and trigger Dany's snap.

##RESULTS

Here are the top ten most upvoted topics from the [Debate Topic Vote thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1den5w/spoilers_all_asoiaf_debate_series_topic_selection/) as of 10AM GMT, May 5, 2013:

|VOTES|TOPIC
|-:|:-
|156|If Robb had not bedded and married Jeyne Westerling, he would have won his campaign and reigned over a newly-independent North. Agree or disagree?
|150|Is Tyrion a reliable narrator? Since the events he describes are significantly more isolated than any other POV character, we are more dependent on his viewpoint to understand what is going on. We sympathize with him because we hear his side of the story. Is this correct though? Every other POV character (except Jaime) thinks of him as being the embodiment of evil and when his secret plots are revealed by other characters, they present a significantly more cynical interpretation of his motives and deeds. Any competent villain can delude themselves and others into thinking they are doing the right thing even when it's something objectively horrible.
|149|Varys vs. Littlefinger, who is more effective and who will win in the end?
|145|Most Moral Character: Jaime or Ned?
|140|Did Jon Snow hold true to his Night's Watch vows and duties in ADWD?
|135|Varys is doing what is best for the realm. Agree or disagree?
|130|Do Gods Exist in ASOIAF? Are deities in the world truly real and do they influence the lives of mortals?
|126|Is Bran being corrupted or improved by the children of the forest and the three-eyed crow above The Wall?
|117|Although their methods differ, Wyman Manderly was playing the Game just as early and effectively as Roose Bolton. Agree or disagree? Expanded: Do you believe in the Northern Conspiracy? Why or why not?
|117|Daenerys Targaryen is at least partially mad: agree or disagree?
***
##SCHEDULE

Only the top five make it, so below is the *tentative* schedule. I have reworded some topics as impartial propositions, so that they have clear affirmative and negative sides to argue. Some I have changed to be more specific and less speculative. I appreciate input on the changes.

|DATE|TOPIC
|:-:|:-
|May 12|Varys vs Littlefinger: Varys is more effective and better positioned to win in the end than Littlefinger. Agree or disagree?
|May 26|If Robb had not bedded and married Jeyne Westerling, he would have won his campaign and reigned over a newly-independent North. Agree or disagree?
|June 9|Tyrion is not a reliable narrator. He is more evil and less sympathetic than his POV would have us believe. Agree or disagree?
|June 23|Jaime vs. Ned: Jaime is more moral than Ned. Agree or disagree?
|July 7|Jon Snow did not hold true to his Night's Watch vows and duties in ADWD. Agree or disagree?

These are the dates the topics will be debated. The champions and moderator will be selected one week prior to each debate. The actual debate day and times may vary somewhat depending on moderator and champion availability, but the selection thread will always be the Sunday before the debate @ 10PM GMT. Just as a reminder, **you cannot be a champion in consecutive debates.** So if you want one in particular, don't sign up for the one before it.
***
##UPCOMING DEBATE

We will have a debate every two weeks (for now). As you can see our first proposition -- *Varys vs Littlefinger: Varys is more effective and better positioned to win in the end than Littlefinger. Agree or disagree?* -- is set for next Sunday (5/12). We will be voting on the two debate champions and moderator for the debate in a thread this **Sunday (5/5) @ 10PM GMT (6PM EST)**.

The earlier your nomination is in the selection thread the better your chance to win the vote. If you cannot be logged on when the selection thread goes live you can have someone else nominate you by proxy, or [PM me directly](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=galanix) to do so. Just state what you want to be nominated for: moderator, champion for, or champion against; **you can only pick one**. You can accompany your nomination with a short ""sales pitch"" explaining why you should be selected (200 word maximum). Please refrain from being too in-depth about the actual debate topic in your sales pitch, since we hope to save as much of that for the actual debate. You can nominate someone other than yourself as well, but obviously he/she will have to accept the nomination if selected.

##REMINDER

If you are particularly passionate about one or more of the above scheduled topics, I can give you a reminder a day before the selection thread is put up. To receive this reminder leave a response to the appropriate ""ADVANCE NOTICE"" comment below.

**NOTE:** There are a ton of people asking for reminders, which is fine, but I just wanted to clarify that the reminders are intended solely for people who intend to act as champion or moderator for a particular debate. I suspect some of you may just want a reminder of when a debate is coming. If indeed there really is this much enthusiasm for applying (which is great btw)... well godspeed, but remember only one moderator and two champions are selected per debate.

Note, there is considerable overlap (i.e. the various plotlines currently converging in Meereen are mentioned separately). Chapters/excerpts from TWOW thus far are not being taken into account.

Grouped (very broadly) by rough geographical location:

* Daenerys, currently in the Dothraki sea with Drogon, found by Khal Jhaqo
* Victarion and Moqorro, about to arrive at Meereen
* Barristan, preparing for battle with the Yunkai
* Tyrion, currently with the Second Sons on the other side of the battle, plotting to bring the sellswords to Daenery’s side

* Euron and the Ironborn, raiding along the Reach
* Cersei, the Faith, the Tyrells and the King’s Landing politics: specifically her trial
* Aegon and Jon Connington at Griffin’s Roost, about to attack Storm’s End
* Arianne and the rest of the Dornish in Sunspear, planning to join their forces with Aegon’s
* Sam and Gilly at the Citadel in Oldtown, where Alleras (presumably Sarella) and Pate (presumably Jaqen) are also

* Brienne and Jaime, presumably on their way to Lady Stoneheart
* Sansa/Alayne and Littlefinger at the Gates of the Moon, plotting her marriage to Harry (and, subsequently, returning Sansa to her birthright of Winterfell)
* Arya/No One in Braavos learning to become a Faceless Man

* Jon and Melisandre, at the Wall, Jon possibly killed
* Bran, Jojen and Meera, beyond the Wall with Bloodraven, Coldhands and the Children of the Forest
* Theon, Asha, Jeyne, Mance, Stannis, the Boltons and the Northmen, at or surrounding Winterfell
* Davos, currently on his way to Skagos to find Rickon

**Other things worth noting:** The Blackfish’s escape from Riverrun, the horns currently in the possession of Sam and Victarion, the possibility that the Hound is still alive, “Ser Robert Strong” Cersei’s champion for her trial, Kevan Lannister’s death at the hands of Varys, the possibility of something seriously shady going on with the Maesters, the fall of Dragonstone at the hands of the Tyrells, Wyman Manderly’s plots in the North, what the hell happened to Benjen Stark, Maege Mormont and Galbert Glover's plots in the North, Shireen and Connington’s Greyscale afflictions, Illyrio's plans, we still don't know who the Harpy is, Nymeria has a pack of wolves currently terrorizing the Riverlands, and the fact that there’s an army of Ice Zombies presumably moving south. 

And of course, winter has officially arrived. GRRM has some serious ground to cover.

""When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.""

------------------------------------------------------------

**When the sun rises in the west**

The Martells, who have a **Sun** in their sigil, are rising against the Iron Throne in **Westeros**

**and sets in the east**

Quentyn **Martell died** in Mereen, far **east** from his homeland.

**When the seas go dry**

After many years, the Ironborn are raiding the mainland again. They are the **sea** (as seen in Brans dream) and they are going far inland, into ""dry"" areas.

**mountains blow in the wind like leaves**

Ser Gregor Clegane, The **Mountain** that Rides, is dead (or is he?)

**When your womb quickens again**

Danys probably miscarried.

**and you bear a living child**

Even if she miscarried, the child could have been alive, or maybe this is yet to happen.

---------------------------------------------

Here's the thing: **I don't think that was a prophecy**. Why would Mirri Maz Duur make a prophecy about Drogo actually returning and Dany being able to have children again? I think she was just trying to say, in a very omnious way, ""never!!!!! mwahahaha"". She wanted to piss Dany off. 

And yet, while I agree some of the items I listed before may be tinfoily, you have to admit the ""sun rises in the west and sets in the east"" part is kinda interesting.

So, what does this mean? Is it actually a prophecy? or just poetic justice? is this just Gurm telling us that in this world, even what is supposed to mean ""impossible"" can actually happen, and that every word can have countless meanings and repercutions? or is my brain finding patterns were there are none? (who's ever heard of a brain doing something *that* crazy?)

--------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT:** 

Lots of people have pointed out that the sea going dry could mean the Dothraki sea, which I think makes much more sense than my theory. It's also been suggested that the ""mountains"" are the Mereen Pyramids, I think this makes more sense than Gregor, but I'm not really convinced.

1366813781.0,273,self.asoiaf,1d0eeb,(spoilers all) Really sick of hearing a certain theory regarding the parentage of Tyrion and an alternate theory,johnnywup,391,118,245,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1d0eeb/spoilers_all_really_sick_of_hearing_a_certain/,"I really don't understand why so many people think Tyrion is a Targaryen. Is it just because he's a fan favorite and people want him to have a dragon? It seems much more likely that Jaime and Cersei are Targaryens, to me.

cersei was definitely born first and a lot of people think jaime may be the volanqar (I won't dispute this-- I'm just providing an additional interpretation).

It is known that Aerys took a... liking to Joanna, Tywins wife. If Jaime &amp; Cersei are in fact children of Aerys, then a ton of things begin to make sense.

For one thing, about half of the targaryens were crazy. The quote was something like ""the gods flip a coin every time a Targaryen is born"", yeah? Well, Joffrey and Cersei seem to be pretty crazy, while Tommen, Myrcella and Jaime don't seem crazy. That's 2/5 crazy, pretty close to 50%. 

There's also the incest, but I don't really see how it can be genetic to want incest, but there's that.

In Jaime's dream about his mother, Joanna, she says that 
&gt;We all dream of things we cannot have. Tywin dreamed that his son would be a great knight, that his daughter would be a queen. He dreamed they would be so strong and brave and beautiful that no one would ever laugh at them.
Jaime responds 
&gt;I am a knight and cersei is a queen.
Now obviously that's true so what did Joanna mean? Tywin wishes that they were his children.

Genna Lannister says to Jaime
&gt;Tyrion is Tywin's son, not you. I said so once to your father's face, and he would not speak to me for half a year.

Tyrion is the only one between himself, Jaime, and Cersei that is ""intelligent"", a Lannister trait. Being beautiful is a Targaryen trait, not a Lannister trait. And the only one that shared Tywins love for whores was Tyrion.

That's why tywin is so bitter all the time. He knows that the two children he loves as his own aren't actually his and the one that is his he wishes was not.

Cersei also has a fixation on wildfire and takes her family icon very seriously like the Targaryens. Aerion attacked a puppeteer ""making fun"" of targs, and cersei did the same thing about someone with puppets of Lions

Also explains why Aerys kept Jaime so close...he was his son. This also draws a nice parallel between Jaime and Tyrion, both having killed their fathers.

If you're wondering about the tywin whores thing, Varys once told Tyrion that a certain hand once made a tunnel to go to Chatayas brothel. The only person who varys could know did that in the time Varys was in KL is Tywin. Not to mention that he was with Shae when he died. The apple didn't fall very fall from the tree.

&gt;	Oh my sweet summer child … What do you know of fear? Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundered feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north, when the sun hides it face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move through the woods.
The Others … Thousands and thousands of years ago, a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man. There came a night that lasted a generation, and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels. Women smothered their children rather than see them starve, and cried, and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks.
&gt;      In that darkness, the Others came for the first time … They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its veins. They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding pale dead horses, and leading hosts of the slain. All the swords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes, found no pity in them. They hunted the maids through the frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children.
&gt;      Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men, who had taken those lands from the children of the forest. Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods, the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch. So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog and a dozen companions. For years he searches until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it. And the Others smelled the hot blood in him and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds –

He would only be there if he wanted to be, and the only reason for that would be to kill someone. I think Jaqen was hired to kill Ned Stark. Jaqen gets himself thrown in the dungeon to try to get close and once he learns that Ned will be taking the black, he gets himself selected by Yoren.

At this point, no one knew Jeoffrey was going to kill Ned, so it seemed like a good plan. And Jaqen only tries to get away once he is on the way to the wall, where he would have figured out Ned wasn't there and had already been killed.

People have talked about him becoming a wight and helping the Others. People have talked about Mel reviving him. People have talked about him warging into Ghost. People have talked about him warging into Ghost and then being revived and returning back to his body. People have talked about him being reborn in a funeral pyre.

While similar events have happened through the series, I was thinking about a possibility that is a bit more simple and has also happened. In GoT one of the Stark children suffers from something that every character says should have killed him. Bran is thrown out a window and manages to survive. Not only does he survive, but he talks to the Three Eyed Raven and gets shown all kinds of cool stuff. Then he wakes up and has more control over his warging abilities. 

Isn't it possible that rather than needing Mel to revive him or a funeral pyre or any of the other possibilities mentioned, that Jon will just be in a coma. Either Bran or Bloodraven will be able to talk to him and show him whatever floats their boat, and then after some time passes he can wake up.

##MODERATOR [GALANIX'S](/u/galanix) OPENING WORDS

Varys and Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish are both introduced to us as very enigmatic characters with hidden agendas. Both are major players in the game of thrones, having influenced many of the events in the books thus far.

I won't go over their entire histories and what events they have been involved in, but I encourage everyone to briefly read up on the histories of [Varys](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Varys) and [Littlefinger](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Littlefinger) on the wiki. I presume both of our champions will touch on many of the book events. Concerning their beginnings; both had humble beginnings. Varys allegedly as a slave in Lys and Littlefinger the son a lesser lord on the Fingers. Both also established themselves in powerful positions on the King's small council.

So who is the more effective of the two and who is better positioned to win? This largely depends on how you determine ""winning"". For the purposes of this debate let's assume this means winning the game of thrones. Both are trying to amass power in Westeros through different routes with both of them presumably wanting control over the Iron Throne. It will be the job of our champions to determine whose route to power is more effective, and who has done a better job of enacting their plans.

In terms of positioning, Littlefinger has positioned himself as the Lord Paramount of the Riverlands (via Harrenhal), Lord Protector of the Vale (for a year at least), and plans to marry Sansa to Harry the Heir and consolidate power thusly. Varys meanwhile has been lying in wait for a while with plans of seating a Targaryen on the Iron Throne along with his powerful ally [Illyrio Mopatis](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Illyrio). He currently is backing Aegon and the Golden Company who have most recently landed in the Stormlands and are poised to make that their base of power. There is also a Dornish alliance in the works, possible Reach allies, and Dany and her dragons. Most recently of course Varys has assassinated Kevan Lannister, Lord Regent of the realm.

Varys or Littlefinger? Who is the better of the two? Our champions will certainly have something to say about it.

Somehow he's so proficient at with these ladies that they forego any payment which astounds both highborn and lowborn alike. Now, some fans based on this some are joking he's ""Pod the tripod"" or some such which I found funny but off. Seems odd as I doubt women that have sex for money care too much about a guy with a large penis. Size does not equal pleasure and at a point creates too much discomfort. Likewise, there's bound to be guys skilled in standard intercourse which can be learned.

Anyway, it just hit me that the joke will be he's a natural master of the Lord's Kiss. This is mentioned in the book as happening between Jon and Igrid in a way to make it seem a rare occurrence beyond the wall. Perhaps it's just as rare south of the wall. I found it a funny theory given that his uncle (or distant cousin) Illyn Payne has no tongue. What would be interesting is if in the show, we learn that Illyn lost his tongue not by bad mouthing the king (say that Tywin is the true ruler of the throne IIRC), but because he pleasured the wrong woman with his tongue. 

So, a pointless theory to explain why the show producers deemed it necessary to spend five minutes on the sexual escapades of Tyrion's page.

1364076538.0,272,self.asoiaf,1avqyx,(Spoilers All) Another theory on Eddard's bastard,Schmogel,351,79,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1avqyx/spoilers_all_another_theory_on_eddards_bastard/,"Tinfoil material I hope you enjoy. 

*There are flaws for sure and I hope you point them out to deepen my understanding of the ASoIaF universe.*

**Love affair**

Ned has an affair with Ashara Dayne, which starts at the Tourney at Harrenhal in 281AL. Brandon is alive and betrothed to Catelyn. So Ned doesn't feel that bad about premarital intercourse and accidentally gets her with child, but the girl is stillborn. In 282AL Brandon and his father get killed, so Catelyn is passed on to Eddard. He stops the affair, but Ashara already is pregnant a second time. She travels home to Starfall. The rumors about her being mother of Eddard's bastard are true, but it's not Jon Snow.

**""Promise me, Ned""**

Rhaegar's wife Elia Martell is weak and bedridden, the Maesters say she can't be with child again, so Rhaegar starts dating Lyanna, ""abducts"" her and hides her in the Tower of Joy. She gets pregnant with Jon. Lyanna's cause of death remains unknown, but probably it's been done under Aerys II command shortly before his death by Jaimie's hand. Eddard rides with his companions to free his sister, finding her in a bed of blood. He promises her to take Jon with him as his own bastard son.

**Farewell**

After the fighting Eddard rides south, taking Dawn, the greatsword of house Dayne south. Why would he do it himself if he has a dead sister to entomb in the crypts of Winterfell? Because this is his last chance to see his first love, Ashara. To apologize for the death of Arthur Dayne, her brother, sworn member of the Kingsguard and still loyal to the Mad King. And to take a look on his true bastard son, who is wetnursed by Wylla. That's a common practice at house Dayne, as Edric will be wetnursed, too. But there's one major problem; Eddard can't suddenly have two bastards of the same age out of nowhere, as he promised to claim Jon his own. He tells Ashara to leave the realm to hide their son. Then he leaves to live with Jon and Catelyn in Winterfell.

**Spiderman**

Now some important Varys background. A famous quote is his riddle about power: 
&gt;In a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword, a little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two. ‘Do it’ says the king, ‘for I am your lawful ruler.’ ‘Do it’ says the priest, ‘for I command you in the names of the gods.’ ‘Do it’ says the rich man, ‘and all this gold shall be yours.’ So tell me-who lives and who dies?

In my opinion the eunuch is a man of gold himself, being paid by his old friend Illyrio Mopatis, who only seeks for money in Westeros, nothing else. He does not care who sits the iron throne, by helping Viserys and Daenerys he hopes to become Master of Coin. But he's not stupid and relies on their success alone. He looks out for every chance to put himself in power. He is quoted: 
&gt;The world is one great web, and a man dare not touch a single strand lest all the others tremble.

He dares to touch all the strands. Also Varys once said: ""Power resides where men believe it resides. No more and no less"". They just don't care who rules over Westeros as long as they get money out of it. Varys was put in place by Illyrio, so he can deploy spiders all over the realm. He also drives Aerys II to madness, pushing Westeros in chaos.

**Violet Eyes**

Ashara Dayne has dark hair and violet eyes, common amongst house Dayne. So does her infant son. They flee to Braavos, somehow with help from Varys and Haldon Halfmaester, who is paid by Illyrio. They fake her suicide. Why do they help her? They already rescued Daenerys and Viserys, but were not able to protect Rhaegar's kids. Their plan is to disguise him as Aegon, to raise him up and educate him. He shall be a king one day. Varys kept in touch with exiled Jon Connington, he knows about JonCons remorse about failing  Rhaegar: 
&gt;I failed the father, but I will not fail the son.

He believes the tale of switching the babe with the [pisswater prince](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Pisswater_prince). Many young children have the tendency to be blond, changing to a darker color over the years. So they started dying him blue at an early age. Ashara disguises as Septa Lemore, having stretch marks from two birthings. Tyrion being fixiated on her body never realizes her eye color. GRRM mentions nearly everyones eyes, so there has to be something special about hers. Jon Connington of course recognizes her (He danced with her at the turney of Harrenhal), but does not become suspicious, as she's sister to Arthur Dayne, best friend of Rhaegar. Even Aegon himself does not know about his real parents.

He believed Bran and Rickon to be dead, which would mean Sansa would be the heir to the north. So, having Sansa in his possession, he counters the Tyrell's plot to marry her to Willas by marrying her to his son Tyrion.

What I'm wondering is *why would he do that?* Yes, if the union went off without a hitch, Tyrion would be lord protector of the North, and his sons would rule Winterfell. All well and good, but what other Lannister is unmarried? *Tywin Fucking Lannister.*

If *Tywin* had married Sansa himself, he wouldn't have had to worry about consummation, and further more, he could get a son on her. A son that would be heir to the North *and* the Westerlands. After that, he could dispose of Tyrion entirely and the entire issue of his succession and legacy would not only be resolved, but also be bolstered by the addition of the North.

It's true he never remarried after Joanna's death, but given Shae, he was obviously not above whoring. Some might object to his marrying of Sansa, given the political implications of it, but the same could be said about Tyrion and wasn't. Tyrion was heir-apparent to the Westerlands, and his children would be lords of the North and Westerlands. It's not as though Tywin had officially (or rather, publicly) disinherited Tyrion after all. Most importantly, he was the most powerful man in the realm at the time of Tyrion's marriage. No one would dare object to this decision to marry Sansa.

Might there be some magic at the Wall/beyond that specifically affects those with dragon blood (aka Targaryens), allowing them to live longer? We know Bloodraven is likely being kept alive by the weirwood itself, but he was likely at a fairly advanced age by the time he even got there. According to the wiki, he was 58 when he first went to the Wall and it's likely he was there for a fairly long time as he was eventually raised to Lord Commander (though Jon was only there for a couple of years before that happened).

On the other hand, we know Aemon is 102 years old when he leaves the wall. He's gone blind and is fairly weak, but he is still completely lucid. It isn't until after he leaves, and almost as soon as he leaves, that he starts to lose it. Sam notes in AFFC:

&gt;Some days he would lose his way when saying something and begin to ramble on about his father or his brother. He is one hundred and two, Sam reminded himself, but he had been just as old at Castle Black and his wits had never wandered there.

And Aemon later says:

&gt;“Or I am an old man, feverish and dying.” He closed his white eyes wearily, then forced them open once again. “I should not have left the Wall. Lord Snow could not have known, but I should have seen it. *Fire consumes, but cold preserves.* The Wall... but it is too late to go running back."" [emphasis mine]

&gt;The slaver shrugged. “Tell her to consider quickly. There are many other buyers. Only three days past I showed these same Unsullied to a corsair king who hopes to buy them all.”

&gt; “The corsair wanted only a hundred, your worship,” Dany heard the slave girl say. He poked her with the end of the whip. “Corsairs are all liars. He’ll buy them all. Tell her that, girl.”

Martin, George R. R. (2011-02-24). A Storm of Swords Complete Edition (Two in One) (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3) (p. 264). Harper Collins, Inc.. Kindle Edition. 

I think that given Euron is going to explore Valyria, with tales that men desert their captains, purchasing 100 Unsullied would not be out of the question.

Secondly ADWD Dany III:

&gt;“Not all your enemies are in the Yellow City. Beware men with cold hearts and blue lips. You had not been gone from Qarth a fortnight when Pyat Pree set out with three of his fellow warlocks, to seek for you in Pentos.” 

&gt;Dany was more amused than afraid. “It is good I turned aside, then. Pentos is half a world from Meereen.” 

&gt;“This is so,” he allowed, “yet soon or late word must reach them of the dragon queen of Slaver’s Bay.”

Martin, George R. R. (2011-07-12). A Dance With Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 5) (p. 211). HarperCollins Publishers. Kindle Edition. 

Are these the 4 Warlocks that Euron captures and locks up?

&gt;“Shade-of-the-evening, the wine of the warlocks. I came upon a cask of it when I captured a certain galleas out of Qarth, along with some cloves and nutmeg, forty bolts of green silk, and four warlocks who told a curious tale. One presumed to threaten me, so I killed him and fed him to the other three. They refused to eat of their friend’s flesh at first, but when they grew hungry enough they had a change of heart. Men are meat.”

&gt;Under the sea the mermen feast on starfish soup, and all the serving men are crabs

The Merman is almost certainly Lord Manderly's forces/himself, but the starfish is something different.

I've seen some [valiant attempts](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/66847-patchface-prophesies/) to figure out whose starfish sigil can possibly connect to this prophecy, but I think GRRM is throwing us a curveball here. **Patchface saw the Bolton's flayed man sigil with his limbs outstretched in his vision and reinterpreted it as a starfish**. We know Manderly wants to supplant Bolton and has a scheme to that effect. We also know his Frey pies and prodigious appetite make him a shoe in for food metaphors. It's a satisfying explanation for me but based on insufficient evidence.

Readers try to connect ""the serving men are crabs"" to someones sigil as well (Such as [House Borrel](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Borrell)), but they may be wrong again. There are two interpretations here that I consider plausible...

1. The former Stark men serving Bolton in ADWD can rightly be described as scavengers picking up whatever scraps they can get. In this case the crabs will switch their allegiances to Manderly just as soon as the soup is ready. 

2. If we want to connect it to a sigil, the crabs line may be a reference to the sigil of House Magnar of Skagos, whose sigil is a green *lobster*. Davos is off to Skagos to retrieve Rickon Stark, and mayhaps the Skagosi will be willing to march off to support the new Wild Wolf reclaim his birthright.

1342652717.0,262,self.asoiaf,wsbsm,(Spoilers all) Character analysis: In defense of Catelyn Tully,soigneusement,375,113,394,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/wsbsm/spoilers_all_character_analysis_in_defense_of/,"(I apologize in advance for the length, but I believe it is a necessary read for everyone in this fandom)

In defense of Catelyn Tully:

For some reason a very large part of this fandom enjoys to heap an exorbitant amount of blame for half the things that go wrong in this series on Catelyn. She is crucified for her mistakes (and the mistakes of others!) while other characters in this series are given a free pass (Ned Stark, Arya Stark and even Jaime Lannister come to mind). I don't think that's very fair, and I'm going to try and break down a couple of reasons why.

**Cat hates Jon Snow, she is such a huge bitch to him!**

I dont't think people that come to this conclusion really take the time to think about the situation Cat is in from her perspective. She was betrothed to Brandon Stark, Brandon was killed, and now she's to marry his quiet younger brother. Cat does her duty without any complaints, they marry, she gets pregnant with their first son, and Ned goes off to war. This man, her husband, returns from the war with a bastard son. Not only is this a huge affront to Catelyn and absolutely disrespectful to her in every way (the man she married as a replacement for Brandon not only slept with another woman, but he has the gall to *bring the evidence home with him*), but is extremely, *extremely* unusual in Westerosi society. Men don't bring home the products of their conquests at war. They just don't. It is an unspoken rule, these ladies will pretend that their lords don't sleep with whores and camp followers, and the lords will share in that denial of knowledge. They don't sleep with a woman and bring the bastard back to their castle to be raised alongside their trueborn children. It is simply not done.

So now imagine you're Cat. You're already extremely hurt that your supposedly incredibly honorable husband who you weren't even supposed to marry in the first place cheated on you with some nameless whore (he won't even tell you her name, ffs, don't you at least deserve to know who he's been fucking while he's away, who the mother of this child is?) but now you have to see the product of his shame (*your* shame) every single day until this child leaves. Every day you are reminded of your husband's infidelity, the shame and embarrassment and disrespect he's brought upon you is embodied in this child. He even plays with your trueborn children as if they were equals (they aren't, he is a bastard, and Robb is to be the lord of Winterfell, they aren't equals and bastards aren't normally raised in castles).

Catelyn has no obligation to play step-mother to Jon. Ned made the bad decision to bring this child home, he is responsible for him. She owes Jon nothing, and their relationship is basically nonexistent, with an understandable undercurrent of anger coupled with non-interaction. Catelyn does not abuse Jon, she does not beat him or berate him or toss him out to live in Winter Town. She is cold toward him, yes, but not cruel. And after all is said and done, when Jon goes to the Wall, Cat even feels *guilty* about the way she treated him.

&gt;Catelyn had nothing against this girl, but suddenly she could not help but think of Ned’s bastard on the Wall, and the thought made her angry and guilty, both at once.

Her relationship with Jon is complex and she wasn't a kind cookie baking step-mother to him, but you cannot blame her for that.

**It's Catelyn's fault that the War of the Five Kings was started in the first place, she kidnapped Tyrion and pissed off the Lannisters!!**

Again, let me place you in Cat's position. Your son has taken an almost fatal fall, and you've been sitting by his side day and night since, barely sleeping, barely eating, your thoughts only of your son and his recovery. One night an assassin comes, and if it hadn't been for your son's direwolf you would both be dead (you have the scars on your hands for your trouble). This assassin is obviously a catspaw, that much is sure, and in his possession is a Valyrian steel dagger. Obviously, you're going to want to find out who is so adamant about wanting your son dead.

So Cat goes off to King's Landing where she meets with Petyr Baelish, someone she believes she can trust, someone who has loved her since childhood.

&gt;“He was my father‟s ward. We grew up together in Riverrun. I
thought of him as a brother...""

Why wouldn't Cat think she could trust Petyr? He's never led her astray before, he almost *died* he loved her so much. And so Catelyn makes her first mistake, a mistake another dear character (Ned Stark, in case you were wondering) made that cost him his life. Another mistake that is seen as a great catalyst in starting the War of the Five Kings. Oddly, Ned doesn't get blamed for putting his trust in Littlefinger, even though it results in his death, his 11 year old daughter becoming a political prisoner, and his son going off to war to avenge him. Moving on...

&gt;Ser Jaime lost a hundred golden dragons, the queen lost an emerald
pendant, and I lost my knife. Her Grace got the emerald back, but the winner kept the rest.”

&gt;“Who?” Catelyn demanded, her mouth dry with fear. Her fingers ached with remembered
pain.

&gt;“The Imp,” said Littlefinger as Lord Varys watched her face. “Tyrion Lannister.”

Littlefinger explicitly tells Cat that Tyrion Lannister is responsible for the attempt on her son's life. If you were in her position, I doubt you would sit back idly doing nothing. It's also interesting to me that Varys is there as well, it's really quite fishy. It makes me wonder if perhaps Littlefinger and Varys had possibly been in cahoots about this, from the moment that Varys slips Petyr's dagger to Joffrey and whispers in his ear about gaining Robert's approval (this is speculation, but I think it has merit). 

So, with this information, Catelyn captures Tyrion, the man she believes responsible for trying to kill Bran. You know how it ends, and I will concede that Cat didn't go about this in the best possible way. However, I believe that her mistake is totally justifiable and not something that should be touted as the reason for the war. Even if she hadn't taken Tyrion the war would have erupted, everything was on unstable ground just waiting to collapse. Cat nabbing Tyrion was just a convenient catalyst to finally set the ball rolling. The war would have happened regardless, and the amount of blame placed on Cat for it is absurd.

**Cat is an idiot and it's her fault Robb died and Jaime lost his hand, she's an emotional hot mess and her mistakes are unforgivable!**

Okay. First let's establish Cat's mindset around the time of the war. She has just lost her husband, she hasn't seen 4/5 of her children in months and 2/5 are in grave mortal danger. And despite all of this, Cat remains a levelheaded woman trying with all her might to reconcile Robb the lord and Robb her son, as well as counseling him as best she can in terms of decisions about the war. She tells Robb not to send Theon back to Pyke.

&gt;“I‟ll say again, I would sooner you sent someone else to Pyke, and kept
Theon close to you.”

&gt;“Who better to treat with Balon Greyjoy than his son?”

&gt;“Jason Mallister,” offered Catelyn. “Tytos Blackwood. Stevron Frey. Anyone . . . but not Theon.”

&gt;Her son squatted beside Grey Wind, ruffling the wolf's fur and incidentally avoiding her eyes.

It is also Cat's decision to call upon Renly Baratheon for help.

&gt;“We have some time yet before we must face them. This lot will be sellswords, freeriders, and
green boys from the stews of Lannisport. Ser Stafford must see that they are armed and drilled before he dare risk battle . . . and make no mistake, Lord Tywin is not the Kingslayer. He will not rush in heedless. He will wait patiently for Ser Stafford to march before he stirs from behind the walls of Harrenhal.”

&gt;“Unless . . .” said Catelyn.

&gt;“Yes?” Ser Brynden prompted.

&gt;“Unless he must leave Harrenhal,” she said, “to face some other threat.”

&gt;Her uncle looked at her thoughtfully. “Lord Renly.”

&gt;“King Renly.” If she would ask help from the man, she would need to grant him the style he had claimed for himself.

Cat is a politically savvy creature where her son is young and reckless (understandably, he is a boy of 15 who has just been shouldered with an immense amount of responsibility). She prefers to be cautious about things instead of rushing into battle at every opportunity.

Her holds were huge, and Victarion packed them with armed men. With her would sail the other, lesser prizes that the Iron Fleet had taken on its long voyage to Slaver's Bay, a lubberly assortment of cogs, great cogs, carracks, and trading galleys salted here and there with fishing boats. It was a fleet both fat and feeble, promising much in the way of wool and wines and other trade goods and little in the way of danger. Victarion gave the command of it to Wulf One-Ear.

""The slavers may shiver when they spy your sails rising from the sea,"" he told him. ""but once they see you plain they will laugh at their fears. Traders and fishers, that's all you are. Any man can see that. Let them get close as they like, but keep your men hidden belowdecks until you are ready. Then close, and board them. Free the slaves and feed the slavers to the sea, but take the ships. We will have need of every hull to carry us back home.""

""Home,"" Wulf grinned. ""The men'll like the sound o' that, Lord Captain. The ships first – then we break these Yunkishmen. Aye.""

The *Iron Victory* was lashed alongside the *Noble Lady*, the two ships bound tight with chains and grappling hooks, a ladder stretched between them. The great cog was much larger than the warship and sat higher in the water. All along the gunwales the faces of the Ironborn peered down, watching as Victarion clapped Wulf One-Ear on the shoulder and sent him clambering up the ladder. The sea was smooth and still, the sky bright with stars. Wulf ordered the ladder drawn up, the chains cast off. The warship and the cog parted ways. In the distance the rest of Victarion's famed fleet was raising sail. A ragged cheer went up from the crew of the *Iron Victory*, and was answered in kind by the men of the *Noble Lady*.

Victarion had given Wulf his best fighters. He envied them. They would be the first to strike a blow, the first to see that look of fear in the foemen's eyes. As he stood at the prow of the *Iron Victory* watching One-Ear's merchant ships vanish one by one into the west, the faces of the first foes he'd ever slain came back to Victarion Greyjoy. He thought of his first ship, of his first woman. A restlessness was in him, a hunger for the dawn and the things this day would bring. *Death or glory, I will drink my fill of both today.* The Seastone Chair should've been his when Balon died, but his brother Euron had stolen it from him, just as he had stolen his wife many years before. *He stole her and he soiled her, but he left it for me to slay her.*

All that was done and gone now, though. Victarion would have his due at last. *I have the horn, and soon I will have the woman. A woman lovelier than the wife he made me kill.*

""Captain."" The voice belonged to Longwater Pyke. ""The oarsmen await your pleasure.""

Three of them, and strong ones. ""Send them to my cabin. I'll want the priest as well.""

The oarsmen were all big. One was a boy, one a brute, one a bastard’s bastard. The Boy had been rowing for less than a year, the Brute for twenty. They had names, but Victarion did not know them. One had come from *Lamentation*, one from *Sparrow Hawk*, one from *Spider Kiss*. He could not be expected to know the names of every thrall who had ever pulled an oar in the Iron Fleet.

“Show them the horn,” he commanded, when the three had been ushered into his cabin.

Moqorro brought it forth, and the dusky woman lifted up a lantern to give them all a look. In the shifting lantern light the hell-horn seemed to writhe and turn in the priest’s hands like a serpent fighting to escape. Moqorro was a man of monstrous size – big-bellied, broad-shouldered, towering – but even in his grasp the horn looked huge.

“My brother found this thing on Valyria,” Victarion told the thralls. “Think how big the dragon must’ve been to bear two of these upon his head. Bigger than Vhagar or Meraxes, bigger than Balerion the Black Dread.” He took the horn from Moqorro and ran his palm along its curves. “At the Kingsmoot on Old Wyk one of Euron’s mutes blew upon this horn. Some of you will remember. It was not a sound that any man who heard it will ever forget.”

“They say he died,” the Boy said, “him who blew the horn.”

“Aye. The horn was smoking after. The mute had blisters on his lips, and the bird inked across his chest was bleeding. He died the next day. When they cut him open his lungs were black.”

“The horn is cursed,” said the Bastard’s Bastard.

“A dragon’s horn from Valyria,” said Victarion. “Aye, it’s cursed. I never said it wasn’t.” He brushed his hand across one of the red gold bands and the ancient glyph seemed to sing beneath his fingertips. For half a heartbeat he wanted nothing so much as to sound the horn himself. *Euron was a fool to give me this, it is a precious thing, and powerful. With this I’ll win the Seastone Chair, and then the Iron Throne. With this I’ll win the world.*

“Claggorn blew the horn thrice and died for it. He was as big as any of you, and strong as me. So strong that he could twist a man’s head right off his shoulders with only his bare hands, and yet the horn killed him.”

“It will kill us too, then,” said the Boy.

Victarion did not oft forgive a thrall for talking out of turn, but the Boy was young, no more than twenty, and soon to die besides. He let it pass.

“The mute sounded the horn three times. You three will sound it only once. Might be you’ll die, might be you won’t. All men die. The Iron Fleet is sailing into battle. Many on this very ship will be dead before the sun goes down – stabbed or slashed, gutted, drowned, burned alive – only the Gods know which of us will still be here come the morrow. Sound the horn and live and I’ll make free men of you, one or two or all three. I’ll give you wives, a bit of land, a ship to sail, thralls of your own. Men will know your names.”

“Even you, Lord Captain?” asked the Bastard’s Bastard.

“Aye.”

“I’ll do it then.”

“And me,” said the Boy.

The Brute crossed his arms and nodded.

If it made the three feel braver to believe they had a choice, let them cling to that. Victarion cared little what they believed, they were only thralls.

“You will sail with me on *Iron Victory*,” he told them, “but you will not join the battle. Boy, you’re the youngest – you’ll sound the horn first. When the time comes you will blow it long and loud. They say you are strong. Blow the horn until you are too weak to stand, until the last bit of breath has been squeezed from you, until your lungs are burning. Let the freedmen hear you in Meereen, the slavers in Yunkai, the ghosts in Astapor. Let the monkeys shit themselves at the sound when it rolls across the Isle of Cedars. Then pass the horn along to the next man. Do you hear me? Do you know what to do?”

The Boy and the Bastard’s Bastard tugged their forelocks; the Brute might’ve done the same, but he was bald.

“You may touch the horn. Then go.”

They left him one by one. The three thralls, and then Moqorro. Victarion would not let him take the hell-horn.

“I will keep it here with me, until it is needed.”

“As you command. Would you have me bleed you?”

Victarion seized the dusky woman by the wrist and pulled her to him. “She will do it. Go pray to your red god. Light your fire, and tell me what you see.”

For example, the scene where Thoros of Myr meets the Red Priestess blew my fucking mind.  I tried to start up conversation with show watchers about the scene, but it was nothing special to them.

One of the changes in the Red Wedding seemed to be for the benefit of book readers, too.  I'm sure we've all heard the rumors that Jeyne Westerling was prego with Robb's heir, and escaped with the Blackfish.  And even if we knew it was an unlikely theory, I'm sure many of us *wanted* it to be true at some point.  Then when Talisa becomes pregnant in the show, I'm sure many of us remembered our Jeyne Westerling theory, and allowed ourselves some hope (even if irrational and fleeting) that perhaps this is proof Jeyne really is pregnant, too!

I think D^2 knew all this, and when they stabbed Talisa in the abdomen multiple times, I felt that hope lost.  If they were going to just kill Talisa, they would have just killed her, but stabbing her in the abdomon in-universe seemed like a pretty clear message to book readers out of universe; ""get the notion that Jeyne is pregnant out of your head, now.""  Obviously the Red Wedding on screen was never going to be as devastating for a book reader as it is for a show watcher, but it was.... Nice(?) too see them put so much thought into making me feel hopeless, too.

The logical part of my brain had already come to terms with Jeyne's not-pregnant status, but the naive optimist side was pretty distraught, if for nothing else than just the shear brutality of the scene.

**Benfrey Frey**: Deceased

**Willamen Frey**: Not present at the Twins since the beginning.

**Olyvar Frey**: Robb's squire who had to be pretty much dragged away by the other Freys after Robb broke his vows. Described as a very good and loyal squire who fought alongside Robb in all his battles. Also sent away from the Twins before the wedding due to loyalty to Robb.

Introduction
-

[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1kav1n/spoilers_all_a_complete_analysis_of_stannis/)

In part 1, I made the claim that ""through a good grasp on strategy and an even better understanding of tactics, Stannis Baratheon is the most well-rounded military commander in Westeros"" and hopefully demonstrated this claim by taking a look at Stannis's actions pre-ASOIAF. Today, I'd like to expand that thesis through looking at Stannis Baratheon during the opening acts of the War of the Five Kings with an emphasis on the Siege of Storm's End of 299 AL. Through this post, I hope to demonstrate that:

**Stannis Baratheon used ethically suspect tactics, but they were effective in achieving his strategic ends.**  
_____________

The Strategic Picture at the Start of A Clash of Kings
-

Stannis Baratheon is introduced to the readers in the prologue of A Clash of Kings. I don't want to get too bogged down with the how Stannis came to view himself as the rightful king of Westeros. Suffice to say that when his older brother Robert died, Stannis believed that the children of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister were not Robert's. Being the second son of Steffon Baratheon, Stannis was the heir to Robert *if* Robert had no trueborn sons. Believing Robert had no trueborn heirs, he prepared to fight his way to the throne. For more on Westerosi succession, I highly recommend /u/galanix's [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/16mqp1/spoilers_all_complete_guide_to_westerosi/) on it. 

Unfortunately for Stannis, there were other claimants to the throne, including his brother. Shortly after the death of Robert, Renly Baratheon, the youngest Baratheon son, crowned himself King and secured Tyrell loyalty by marrying Margaery, the daughter of Lord Mace Tyrell. Robb Stark, son of Eddard, defeated the Lannisters in battle and declared himself King in the North and the Greyjoys were preparing to declare their own independence.

With Renly claiming the loyalty of most Stormland lords, Stannis was denied a regional base to build his army. He was well aware of the numerical inferiority of his army as well as the superiority of his enemies.
 
&gt; It was said that Stannis knew the strength of every house in the Seven Kingdoms. - *A Clash of Kings, Prologue*

However small his army was, Stannis had superiority in one key element: his navy. Drawing from about 100 ships of the royal fleet and an additional 100 sellsail ships, Stannis could boast in having naval superiority if not supremacy along the east coast of Westeros.

Besides military strength, Stannis had something else going for him: Melisandre of Asshai. Lacking much in the way of religious motivation himself, Stannis became a nominal believer in R'hillor, the Lord of Light. He used Melisandre as a means of projecting this eastern ethereal power into Westeros. And while Melisandre and R'hillor are unpopular, their power will come to have great strategic and tactical significance at Storm's End.   
_____________ 

Force Multiplication and Unsavory Tactics
-

&gt; ""I was helping Renly into his armor, and the candles blew out and there was blood everywhere. It was Stannis, Lady Catelyn said. His … his shadow."" - *A Storm of Swords, Chapter 62, Jaimie VII*

Recognizing that his was an untenable position, Stannis acted decisively. He sailed from Dragonstone and besieged Storm's End while Renly was still slowly making his way up the Rose Road. Unable to take the fortress by force of arms, Stannis surrounded the castle with his meager force and blockaded it from the sea. But Renly was coming. He left the majority of his infantry at Bitterbridge and rode hard with his cavalry for Storm's End.

Here, I'm not entirely sure what Stannis planned to do in this situation. It would seem that he wanted to seize Storm's End by force as opposed to giving a long siege to the castle.

&gt; Stannis Baratheon's foragers had cut the trees down for his siege towers and catapults. - *A Clash of Kings, Chapter 31, Catelyn III*

But what was his plan when Renly arrived? Did he expect Renly to capitulate to his claim during their parlay? I guess we're led to believe that Stannis expects to win Renly over on the strength of his claim, or more that Melisandre has seen Renly die in her flames, so he doesn't put a lot of thought into the battle itself. Still though, it would be unlike Stannis not to have a plan. Renly had 20,000-odd soldiers to Stannis's maybe 5,000. Barring an act of *God*, Stannis would face destruction.

As Stannis and Renly rode back to their camps, everyone expected Renly to triumph over Stannis. Some of Renly's lords cautioned Renly to wait for his infantry to arrive. Others such as Randyll Tarly urged speed. None of it mattered. Unbeknownst to Renly (or Stannis himself), Stannis had a weapon which would change the outcome of the war: Melisandre and her Shadow Assassins.

The U.S. Army has a [3:1 rule](http://onviolence.com/?e=191) when attacking or defending. However that ratio can be altered by what are known as force multipliers defined as:

&gt; A capability that, when added to and employed by a combat force, significantly increases the combat potential of that force and thus enhances the probability of successful mission accomplishment. [Department of Defense Joint Publication 3-05.1, pg 394](http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_05_01.pdf)

Melisandre's Shadow Assassin was a force multiplier in that it increased the combat potential (defined very narrowly in this case) of Stannis's force. When Renly was killed by the shadow baby, the odds of Stannis's success improved. Most of the soldiers under Renly's command defected to Stannis as they had nowhere else to go. Without Renly, the loyalty of most of the Stormlander lords and their bannermen came to Stannis. But key leaders from the Reach, to include Loras Tyrell and Randyll Tarly, fled back to Bitterbridge to join with the rest of Mace Tyrell's army.

With Renly dead, his army bolstered by ranks of Stormlanders and Florents, Stannis was finally in a position to seize Storm's End. The only thing standing in his way was a stubborn castellan by the name of Ser Cortnay Penrose.

Cortnay Penrose refused to surrender, because he did not trust Stannis with Edric Storm, Robert's only acknowledged bastard. Cortnay was not out of bounds with his rationale (as was demonstrated in a Storm of Swords). After insulting R'hillor, Stannis, all the newly-sworn lords of Stannis, Cortnay threw his glove at Stannis and challenged him to single combat.

&gt; ""Bring on your storm, my lord—and recall, if you do, the name of this castle."" - *A Clash of Kings, Chapter 42, Davos II*

It would have been foolishness for Stannis to accept or to allow any of his bannermen to fight in his stead. He was assured victory in taking the castle, but he also did not want to storm the castle itself.

Unwilling to lose thousands of his soldiers in taking Storm's End by force or to let one of his knights or lords face Ser Cortnay Penrose in single combat, Stannis elected to send Melisandre to deal with this stubborn knight. An interesting parallel is that Stannis's decision mirrors Tywin Lannister's later justification for the Red Wedding.

&gt; ""Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner."" - *A Storm of Swords, Chapter 53, Tyrion VI*

The result of utilizing a Shadow Assassin was much as it had been with Renly. A shadow warrior was birthed under the walls of Storm's End and pushed Ser Cortnay Penrose to his death, the castle surrendered and Stannis prepared to march on King's Landing. 
_____________

Moral Culpability?
-

A question that's asked frequently is how much Stannis knew about the Shadow Assassin. My answer is that on a conscious level, Stannis did not know about the Shadow Warriors that Melisandre birthed. On a subconscious level, Stannis wracked with guilt at the use of under-handed tactics.

&gt; ""I dream of it sometimes. Of Renly's dying. A green tent, candles, a woman screaming. And blood."" Stannis looked down at his hands. ""I was still abed when he died. Your Devan will tell you. He tried to wake me. Dawn was nigh and my lords were waiting, fretting. I should have been ahorse, armored. I knew Renly would attack at break of day. Devan says I thrashed and cried out, but what does it matter? It was a dream. I was in my tent when Renly died, and when I woke my hands were clean."" - *A Clash of Kings, Chapter 42, Davos II*

Stannis's moral culpability in utilizing this tactic lies in not asking questions, but I don't believe that Stannis consciously endorsed Shadow Assassins, but I believe that sub-consciously, he feels guilty from it. He also did profit **greatly** from this tactic.

Conclusion

I started writing this post with the idea of writing about Storm's End and the Siege of King's Landing, but the writing got a bit unwieldy to try to tie everything together. The good news is that I have about half of the Siege of King's Landing post written, and I will do my damndest to get it written and posted by tomorrow afternoon.

1375905082.0,259,self.asoiaf,1jwlm5,(Spoilers All) Another (Possibly New) Theory On the Fate of Jon Snow,Odd_or_Even,368,109,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1jwlm5/spoilers_all_another_possibly_new_theory_on_the/,"So I know this might seem like a really anti climactic theory on what happened to Jon at the end of ADWD but **I think that there is a chance that Ghost is the one that was stabbed and possibly killed, not Jon**. While I think its not the most likely theory, I do think it would be one of the more surprising. I'm not sure if there is anything directly disproving this theory considering I have only read through the books once.

We know that Jon is a warg and that he is not aware of how to use his power. The only time he has warged into ghost have been in dreams. So I think it is conceivable that he could have accidentally warged into Ghost and not have realized it. After his speech he goes outside and hears a scream and runs off to see where it came from and stumbles on to Wun Wun tearing apart one of the queens men. As Jon is running to where the scream is coming from GRRM is very non descriptive, which is very unlike him. Typically it would have taken Jon a whole page to find where the screams were coming from. It is at this point that I think Jon could have warged into Ghost without knowing. 

When Jon is trying to calm down Wun Wun he shouts orders at people but nobody even acknowledges that he is saying anything. If Jon was Ghost at this point it would make sense that no one could hear what he is say because 1.) Ghost is silent and 2.) Ghost is a wolf. When Wick slashes at Jon's throat and is rejected Wick backs away with his hands up almost as if he is afraid of being attacked by a wild animal and not a surprised Jon. When Jon goes to reach for his sword he fumbles with it and can't even bring it out. To me this seems uncharacteristic of Jon, who comes off as a good swordsman, unless he could not bring it out because he was not in his own body. After he was stabbed the first time it says that he pulled out the blade, but it never says how he did it. He could have easily have done it as Ghost with his mouth. Also he is stabbed four times, which feels like overkill unless they were trying to bring down a large Direwolf. As for the cold that Jon feels after being stabbed it could just be the affect of the animal he is warging into being killed. We know from the prologue and ASOS that when the animal that a warg uses is killed it has an effect on the warg himself. When Varamyr sixskins is inside the eagle and Melisandre burns it Varamyr goes insane for a short period of time. Overall the whole attack on Jon was very vague which lends itself to so many possible theories.

Now you might be wondering why they would have wanted to kill Ghost. earlier in the same chapter it is noted that Ghost had been acting strange since Borroq came to castle black and even nipped at one of the members of the nights watch. I think that in his current state he could have done something that was seen as an attack and caused Wun Wun to freak out. It Also could be that that the members of the nights watch just wanted to send a message to Jon or they wanted to get rid of his Direwolf before they came after him. Also earlier in the chapter Melisandre tells Jon how he needs to be fearful and cautious, and asks him where Ghost is, to which Jon does not reply.

As for why GRRM would do this when he has shown no hesitation to kill or maim popular characters before I think you have to turn to Petyr Baelish who said ""I had no motive. Always keep your foes confused. Sometimes the best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose…Remember that when you come to play the game of thrones."" With GRRM's style of killing popular characters very well known by now this is the only way that he can 1.) kill a popular character, Ghost, without the reader realizing it till they are directly told, 2.) keep Jon alive without using a previously used method of bringing the dead back to life, and 3.) keep the readers guessing.

...

**XII. Walking with Ghosts**

[The Hound](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1elahs/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/) isn't the only figure haunting Brienne's chapters. Dead bodies appear at the start and end of her travels in ASOS and AFFC. At the beginning of their overland journey to King's Landing, Brienne, Jaime, and Cleos encountered the bodies of women hanged from a tree:

&gt;...Jaime made out the smoldering remains of a large building, and a live oak full of dead women.

&gt;The crows had scarcely started on their corpses. The thin ropes cut deeply into the soft flesh of their throats, and when the wind blew they twisted and swayed (ASOS 1/Jaime I).

Brienne felt sorry enough for the women that she cut them down and tried to bury them. Hanged bodies also mark the end of her travels in AFFC. Prior to arriving at the inn of the orphans:

&gt;They came upon the first corpse a mile from the crossroads.

&gt;He swung beneath the limb of a dead tree whose blackened trunk still bore the scars of the lightning that had killed it. The carrion crows had been at work on his face, and wolves had feasted on his lower legs where they dangled near the ground....

&gt;...

&gt;Fifty yards farther on they spied the second body

&gt;...

&gt;After that, hardly a hundred yards went by without a corpse. They dangled under ash and alder, beech and birch, larch and elm, hoary old willows and stately chestnut trees. Each man wore a noose around his neck, and swung from a length of hempen rope, and each man’s mouth was packed with salt...

&gt;Some of the dead men had been bald and some bearded, some young and some old, some short, some tall, some fat, some thin. Swollen in death, with faces gnawed and rotten, they all looked the same. On the gallows tree, all men are brothers. Brienne had read that in a book, though she could not recall which one (AFFC 37/Brienne VII)

Despite herself, Brienne felt just as bad for the hanged raiders as she did for the hanged tavern women: ""These were evil men, Brienne reminded herself, yet the sight still made her sad."" 

Brienne's pity even for these apparently evil men is perhaps justified. These men and women did not have much choice in their fates--the women ""earned their traitors’ collars, with a kiss and a cup of ale"" while the men were ""dregs from a dozen armies, the leavings of the lords"" (recall Septon Meribald's monologue about broken men in Ch 25/Brienne V). Unlike highborn traitors like Robb Stark or Renly Baratheon, the names of these hanged women and men won't be recorded in any histories, their deeds won't be recounted in songs. 

It's significant that these hanged common people mark the start and end of Brienne's journeys in ASOS and AFFC. First, they foreshadow her own fate. Second, her travels through the riverlands offer readers a close look at the devastation wrought on the land and people by the War of the Five Kings: ""It is being common-born that is dangerous, when the great lords play their game of thrones"" (AFFC 37/Brienne VII). But even the nobly born are not necessarily masters of their destinies. Like the hanged people, Brienne was given an impossible choice, doomed no matter what she did.

As I've discussed in previous posts, [gender and birth](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1e1o19/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/), and the codes of [honor](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dl37d/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/) and [chivalry](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dxv4m/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/) constrain the choices and decisions of the characters. But the deeds of living men and women are also, in many ways, predetermined by the departed. Robb Stark carried out a war to avenge his dead father. Ned Stark did the same for his dead father and brother. After learning about [Tywin's role in Robb's downfall](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1c9c19/spoilers_all_lord_tywins_plan/), Jaime reflects, ""Even from the grave, Lord Tywin’s dead hand moves us all"" (AFFC 44/Jaime VII). Brienne herself was on a quest to fulfill a promise to a dead woman. It's no wonder, perhaps, that the Maid of Tarth encountered the dead everywhere while on this quest.

The dead haunt the memory of the living. One ghost who appears several times in Brienne's chapters is Ser Goodwin, who had been the master-at-arms for Lord Selwyn. This shade gives Brienne advice that helps her survive several fights:

&gt;Old Ser Goodwin was long in his grave, yet she could hear him whispering in her ear. Men will always underestimate you, he said, and their pride will make them want to vanquish you quickly, lest it be said that a woman tried them sorely. Let them spend their strength in furious attacks, whilst you conserve your own. Wait and watch, girl, wait and watch. (AFFC 37/Brienne VII)

.

&gt;His strength, his speed, his valor, all his hard-won skill... it was worth less than a mummer’s fart, because he flinched from killing. Remember that, girl.”

&gt;I will, she promised his shade, there in the piney wood...I will remember, and I pray I will not flinch (AFFC 20/Brienne IV).

But for the most part, the ghosts haunting Brienne are not kindly: 

&gt;That was where the archers hid and slew poor Cleos Frey...but half a mile farther on she passed another wall that looked much like the first and found herself uncertain....Had she ridden past the place where Ser Jaime had snatched his cousin’s sword from its scabbard? Where were the woods they’d fought in? The stream where they’d splashed and slashed at one another until they drew the Brave Companions down upon them?

&gt;“My lady? Ser?...What are you looking for?”

&gt;Ghosts.... (AFFC 14/Brienne III)

And later: 

&gt;Ser Myles was bold as brass till that Robert killed him.”

&gt;More ghosts, Brienne thought. (AFFC 14/Brienne III)

Although she is a warrior maid, Brienne has no taste for killing. ""You have a man’s strength in your arms,” Ser Goodwin had said to her, more than once, “but your heart is as soft as any maid’s"" (AFFC 20/Brienne IV). Ser Goodwin used to make her slaughter lambs and piglets to toughen her up, but Brienne still hasn't become desensitized to killing. Her guilt over it infects her dreams:

&gt;...[S]he dreamed about the men she’d killed. They danced around her, mocking her, pinching at her as she slashed at them with her sword. She cut them all to bloody ribbons, yet still they swarmed around her... Shagwell, Timeon, and Pyg, aye, but Randyll Tarly too, and Vargo Hoat, and Red Ronnet Connington. Ronnet had a rose between his fingers. When he held it out to her, she cut his hand off. (AFFC 25/Brienne V)

She doesn't even feel good about killing scumbags like Shagwell, Timeon, and Pyg: 

&gt;Hunt would not listen. He hacked through the dead men’s necks himself, tied the three heads together by the hair, and slung them from his saddle. Brienne had no choice but to try and pretend they were not there, but sometimes, especially at night, she could feel their dead eyes on her back, and once she dreamed she heard them whispering to one another. (AFFC 25/Brienne V)

Even though she is a warrior, Brienne feels profoundly guilty about every life she has taken (or failed to save). Brienne has a lower body count than many other POV characters, yet she's one of the few who spends much time regretting her kills. In fact, the dead are everywhere in Brienne's chapters, watching her, judging her. Why?

-------------------------------
**XIII. What Is Dead May Never Die**

The many instances of Brienne seeing or thinking about ghosts and dead people in her chapters are laying the groundwork for a pivotal moment in her penultimate POV chapter.

Besides [the Hound](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1elahs/spoilers_all_brienne_and_jaime_an_indepth/), the most important ghost that has been haunting AFFC is Renly. The first notable appearance of Renly's ghost was in ACOK when Garlan Tyrell wore Renly's armor to lead the Lannister-Tyrell forces against Stannis. There are many who believed Renly had returned from the grave to avenge himself on his elder brother:

&gt;[Tyrion] “Is it true that Stannis was put to rout by Renly’s ghost?”

&gt;Bronn smiled thinly. “From the winch towers, all we saw was banners in the mud and men throwing down their spears to run, but there’s hundreds in the pot shops and brothels who’ll tell you how they saw Lord Renly kill this one or that one. Most of Stannis’s host had been Renly’s to start, and they went right back over at the sight of him in that shiny green armor.”

&gt;After all his planning, after the sortie and the bridge of ships, after getting his face slashed in two, Tyrion had been eclipsed by a dead man. If indeed Renly is dead. (ASOS 4/Tyrion I)

The losers of the Battle of Blackwater have also spread the tale of Renly's avenging ghost:

&gt;Captain Khorane had told [Davos] of the end of Stannis’s hopes...The Lannisters had taken him from the flank, and his fickle bannermen had abandoned him by the hundreds in the hour of his greatest need. “King Renly’s shade was seen as well...slaying right and left as he led the lion lord’s van. It’s said his green armor took a ghostly glow from the wildfire, and his antlers ran with golden flames.”

&gt;Renly’s shade. Davos wondered if his sons would return as shades as well. He had seen too many queer things on the sea to say that ghosts did not exist.... (ASOS 10/Davos II)

There's even a song at Joffrey's wedding feast about Renly's ghost:

&gt;...Hamish the Harper announced that he would perform “for the ears of gods and men, a song ne’er heard before in all the Seven Kingdoms.” He called it “Lord Renly’s Ride.”

&gt;His fingers moved across the strings of the high harp...“From his throne of bones the Lord of Death looked down on the murdered lord,” Hamish began, and went on to tell how Renly, repenting his attempt to usurp his nephew’s crown, had defied the Lord of Death himself and crossed back to the land of the living to defend the realm against his brother. (ASOS 60/Tyrion VIII)

I will say that some of her activity is a little sketchy, especially when taken in context of the Roose Change video. But to me her being a Lannister spy doesn't explain some changes. Principally, why make her from Volantis? Is it just to remove the house politics the Westerlings? Or was it a calculated change to play into the bigger plot?

To me the later makes more sense. Consider this theory if you will. What if the letter we see her pen in last night's episode was indeed to her mother? We also see her at the RW in some of the previews, and it is likely that she dies there. What happens when this noble family from Volantis find out their daughter was murdered and their unborn grand children were murdered? Vengeance of course, Fire and Blood specifically.

My thoughts are that Talisa's mother will replace the role of the Widow of the Waterfront who Tyrion meets while in Volantis. It makes sense that she would seek vengeance against the Iron Throne. It would also make sense that she would actually think favorably of Tyrion, in spite of being a Lannister, because he killed the man who plotted her daughter's death (Tywin). To me this is a way to simplify the politics of Volantis, and makes that storyline much more relevant both to the plot and the the emotional core of the story.

Since there isn't much new material to discuss on this subreddit, I thought I'd ask another hypothetical. Who does everyone think Ned would have married if Rhaegar had never taken Lyanna? This would of course prevent the Rebellion, as well as ensured that Brandon married Cat. I thought of three major candidates :

1. Ashara Dayne. She is an obvious candidate. It seems from the Laughing Knight story that Ned might have had a crush on her. We also know that a Stark ""dishonored"" her at the tourney. Even if it was Brandon, not Ned, who did the deed, she is still an attractive daughter of a powerful Southern lord. Additionally, it's not like she is the only candidate potentially dishonored by Brandon.

2. Cersei. She is a candidate that would fit the bill if you believe Lady Dustin about Rickard's Southron Ambition. Ned, being of a great house, would have potentially been a satisfactory candidate for Tywin. It is true that Ned wasn't Winterfell's heir, but at the time there was a general lack of available great lords/heirs for Cersei to wed, Jon Arryn being the only one I can think of.

3. Lady Dustin. She was the daughter of a Northern Lord (who had the ambition to marry her to a Stark). She would have been a suitable match if Rickard decided to marry Ned to one of his Northern subjects.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1360087860.0,,DuncanTheTall,True,t3_17xp5t,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/17xp5t/who_would_ned_have_married/,

Barristan loved her, her brother was the Sword of the Morning, a Stark 'dishonored' her, and she was apparently beautiful to all. Since her body was never found after her apparent suicide after Robert's Rebellion, there's been a lot of speculation. I've heard that she's young Griff's Septa, young Griff's real mother, Darkstar's mother, and more. 

However, I am putting forward what I think happened all those years ago, mainly because I'm sick of long-gone dead people coming back to life, and mainly because this just makes sense. I'm sure this version of events has been put forward before, but here goes.

Barristan mentions in ADWD that Ashara birthed a still born child, and said ""Stark dishonored her"". Judging by how how he acts with and talks about Ned, I highly doubt Ned is that Stark. Ned's brother Brandon though, fits perfectly. He had the Wolf's Blood and it wouldn't be the first noble lady he 'dishonored' (see: Lady Dustin). This may also be how Howland got to be in the Starks' tent, since Brandon was with Ashara.

So, she gets pregnant by Brandon at Harrenhal. Then, Brandon gets betrothed to Cat and leaves.

Unfortunately, his rage at Lyanna's 'kidnapping' by Prince Rhaegar leads him to King's Landing, where he calls for Rhaegar to fight him. To make this all worse, Rhaegar and Lyanna are at the Tower of Joy in Dorne, so only cruel, paranoid Aerys is there. Her lover *strangles himself watching his father burn to death* thanks to the king. That's awful enough, but remember, Ashara's beloved brother and his friends guard this royal family with their lives, and did nothing. 

Thanks to all the above, war breaks out, thousands die. Her brother is guarding Lyanna, her lover's sister. She feels terrible about that, Lyanna's 'kidnapping' is the indirect cause of Brandon's death and the reason for the war. She thinks that her brother is allowing her to remain captive while Rhaegar is raping her. 

Anyway, the war reaches its' violent finale, and the Targs are practically wiped out. Now, her lover's honorable brother is searching for their younger sister. Considering Arthur is at the ToJ, and that Wylla likely was there as well to nurse Lyanna, Ashara knows her location.

Ashara decides to help him, she knows him and he is as honorable as they come. She gives Ned the location of the Tower of Joy, explaining how Ned knew where Lyanna was. Ned and his loyal friends go there, they find the Kingsguard. We all know what happens next. Ned is forced to cut down Arthur to get to his sister, only to find out that Lyanna went willingly with Rhaegar and had a child (Jon) with him.

So he returns to Ashara with Arthur's sword and tells her that Arthur was in fact good and honorable to the end, and that Lyanna hadn't been taken against her will. It was all for nothing. Ashara's full of remorse and grief for her brother and her lover. On top of all that, her child by Brandon is stillborn. Her hear and spirit shattered and broken, she commits suicide and throws herself off a tower.

Due to the very surprising high participation associated with the [House of the Undying](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/y0r30/spoilers_all_visionbyvision_breakdown_for_house/) thread yesterday (and a great idea by [relikter](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/y0r30/spoilers_all_visionbyvision_breakdown_for_house/c5rcutx)), I've decided to make a similar thread for Patchface.  

I'm going to post each part in individually comments down below, so we can have an organized discussion.  **If I missed a patchface quote, please just write it for me in the same format as I do them.**

# **---The Part about ""Mother of Dragons---""**

Due to a **great** catch by [udontneedaweatherman](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/y0r30/spoilers_all_visionbyvision_breakdown_for_house/c5rc3x1), I want to also have a specific discussion about the *""Mother of Dragons""* creepiness that the Undying were spouting to Dany.  The way I organized the discussion yesterday made a few of the parts we discussed, as [jcamilo70](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/y0r30/spoilers_all_visionbyvision_breakdown_for_house/c5rf6qo) puts it, moot points.  The following paragraph shows a lot of visions in rapid fire, but it does it in groups of three.  See for yourself.  

&gt; Viserys screamed as the molten gold ran down his cheeks and filled his mouth. A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him. Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a woman’s name***. . . . mother of dragons, daughter of death . . .***Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow. A cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a cheering crowd. From a smoking tower, a great stone beast took wing, breathing shadow fire***. . . . mother of dragons, slayer of lies . . .*** Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars. A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly. A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness. . . . ***mother of dragons, bride of fire . . .***

# As such, we're going to discuss them in three different parts down below.

Now i certainty don't think he is dead for good. Snow will either survive his near death experience (though this is not very likely), or he dies and gets resurrected by Melisandre. (We already know that Thoros can bring the recent dead back to life, so why couldn't Mel?) But Jon Snow is not the topic I would like to talk about right now. 

The Wall. There is much and more that could happen. For example, the Night's Watch gave no secret to their disapproval of Snow's choice to bring the wildings beyond The Wall. And I'm willing to bet that the wildings are smart enough to know that Jon Snow is the only thing that is keeping them on the safe side of The Wall. So what would the wildings think to do when they see their only one ""friend"" in the Night's Watch getting stabbed to death?

The moment Snow is dead the rest of the Night's Watch will have no reason to want to keep the wildings with them. The wildings should realize this as well. But we know that the Black Brothers are low on men, and are in no fit condition to fight a battle within The Wall. The wildings are going to kill every last Black Brother in the Night's Watch. While the battle is going on Mel will restore Jon to life. But here we get to a bittersweet moment. Jon Snow is brought back to life, but the Night's Watch is no more.

This will be a pivotal moment for the story. Most of the wildings will likely leave The Wall, and the small amount that remain will not be able to defend The Wall. Leaving Westeros vulnerable to attack. 

There is a lot that could happen here. But then again this is only my personal prediction.

Cogman describes the rationale for various show changes, and also describes their recent several-day trip to GRRM's house to discuss what he's planning for the unpublished books. 

But the writing geek in me found this part most interesting -- he described, in detail, how each season gets plotted out:

&gt; Anyway, if we take Season Three as an example, this was the process:

&gt; 1. I reread A Storm of Swords (and any relevant chapters from other books in the series) and wrote up brief summaries of each chapter, listed the potential new characters, locations, and mapped out the story arcs. (This was during production of Season Two, in Belfast).

&gt; 2. The major characters were then divided up between David, Dan, Vanessa, and myself — with each of us doing a first pass at mapping out the Season Three storyline for each. In my case, I was assigned Stannis/Mel/Davos, Arya, and Bran. This work was done as we were finishing up Season 2 production and over the holiday break.

&gt; 3. In January, back in Los Angeles, the four of us met, threw all our first drafts up on the board and hashed out the season, combining stuff, throwing stuff out, coming up with new stuff, going back to the books for stuff we might have missed, etc… this took a couple of weeks. By the end, we had a rough season mapped out on the board.

&gt; 4. Each of us was then assigned a cluster of episodes to outline… I can’t remember which ones I worked on… Once those were turned in, David &amp; Dan did a final pass on all of it and we had a solid, detailed outline for the season.

&gt; 5. I was assigned episode five. I had about a month to write the first draft, as I recall. I worked off the outline, but there was room (within reason) to invent new scenes, change the order, etc… Then I get my notes, do revisions, etc… we tweak the scripts as we go and, in some cases, come up with new scenes during production. Sometimes those later scenes are written by D&amp;D — for example, there’s an encounter with Jon &amp; Orell in 305 that I didn’t write. And sometimes, storylines shift — usually this is with Dany. All the Essos scenes in 305 were originally scripted by D&amp;D for 306 but moved into my script early in pre-production.

1373976315.0,247,self.asoiaf,1iepin,"(Spoilers All) Jon Snow prediction, perhaps a new theory as to his fate.",TommyShambles,346,99,210,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1iepin/spoilers_all_jon_snow_prediction_perhaps_a_new/,"Alright, I’m not sure if this has been put out there before, but I’ve seen a lot about Jon Snow being brought back by Mel.  But I have a tinfoily theory I’d like to share. If this has been fleshed out, I apologize but I have not seen it on any of the theory compendiums.

I believe that Jon Snow comes back as an other.  Not just some run of the mill other, but of some kind of leadership caste.  We’ve seen others as more than mindless evil killers, and clearly their presence is important, or they wouldn’t have been included in the prologue of GOT, or their return be a once in 8000 year event.

So why would Jon become an other?  

First, it would be very obvious for Mel to just revive him and show him how powerful and fantastic the Lord of Light is.  That type of resurrection would also be virtually identical to Catelyn's.  That the two who never shared any love, and were barely even on speaking terms would make it odd that their experience with death be identical.  Anytime something is ""obvious"" GRRM likes to throw a curve ball.  To me that resurrection seems way too obvious as to be what happens.

As for textual clues, two major ones stand out.  The first from when Snow is stabbed repeatedly.

“When the third dagger took him between the shoulder blades, he gave a grunt and fell face-first into the snow.  He never felt the fourth knife.  Only the cold…” – ADWD 913 of 1016 Kindle Edition.

The cold what? Not ground, not air, just “the cold.”  I don’t need to go over all the allusions about the others relationship with the cold (paraphrasing Sam) “it gets cold when they come, or they come when it gets cold.”  We know that “Coldhands” who may be an other seems to live in a perpetual state of cold.  

When people are stabbed or blood flows, GRRM likes to describe it as hot.  ""The taste of hot blood filled Jon's mouth, and he knew that Ghost had killed that night"" - 145 of 1016 ADWD Kindle Edition.

""He had gorged on human flesh and lapped the blood of dying men as it gushed red and hot from their torn throats."" - 12 of 1016 ADWD Kindle Edition.

It is interested that Jon springing leaks from multiple stab wounds did not feel any warmth, “only the cold”.  That seems somewhat out of the ordinary, even in a cold place like the wall.  ""Only"" seems to exclude any feeling of warmth that would ordinary accompany someone being stabbed.

We don’t know what the process is like when one turns into an other, but I suspect it involves cold.  We also know the dead don’t immediately pop back up and become an other, so perhaps one immediately is taken by the cold, but does not rise until later.  Jon wouldn’t have to immediately pop up and become a walker in view of everyone for this theory to hold. 

Secondly, we have our favorite fool, Patchface!  “Under the sea the crows are white as snow, I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.”   – ADWD 706 of 1016 Kindle Edition.  This fits in two ways.  One, the allusion that in death, the men of the night watch become others.  That theory has been expressed before, that “under the sea” means “in death” which makes a pretty good amount of sense.  What I propose is that he is being more specific, the crows killed after Jon (assuming the scene turns into a bloodbath after Jon’s death) become “white as snow”.  This time, snow means Jon Snow.  So the dead crows become white like him.   Instead of this being a general prophecy for dead at the wall, it is one specific to Jon, who is there when Patchface is speaking.

We know that Mel doesn’t like Patchface, we suspect that he is more than just a fool. If he truly is a prophet of the other, or the drowned god, or some other force of evil, this would make sense.  Patchface gets real excited when Jon walks in referring to him as “The Crow, the crow”, rather just any old crow.  He definitely knows who Jon is.

Mel also keeps seeing snow in the flames.  We know that she is terrified of the other, and she cannot look there to see him in the flames.  Perhaps what she is seeing when she envisions Jon in the flames is snow, endless, white snow, because he has become what she cannot see, the embodiment of the other against which she must fight.

Last, (and this is the biggest stretch) Jon Snow’s name alone.  We know how important his identity and name is.  It has defined him throughout his arc.  We also have many theories that his real last name shouldn’t be Snow, as he might not be a bastard of the north, but of royal blood.  His name Snow, would be another prophecy, disguised by the naming pattern of bastards in Westeros.

Anyway, wanted to see what you all thought.  I know there are other visions out there in the series, and some may fit this, some may not.  I have only read over the books once so I apologize if this is truly half baked!  

**EDIT** No edits to the text above, because that always confuses the discussions but /u/lethargicsquid included one of Bran's dreams which I should not have missed:

&gt;""Finally he looked north. He saw the Wall shining like blue crystal, and his bastard brother Jon sleeping alone in a cold bed, his skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from him.""

&gt; I'm surprised that you didn't mention Bran's dream, as it fits the theory perfectly. Jon's skin growing pale and hard could be a sign of the transition to coldness you are mentioning. In any case, it tends to reinforce the idea that Jon didn't die on the wall when he was stabbed. The mention of cold both at the end of the chapter and in Bran's dream could be a sign that Jon will turn into a white walker.

1349203065.0,243,self.asoiaf,10tv6i,(Spoilers ALL) Benjen Stark's Secret Identity Theory,JayisforJokes,326,83,223,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/10tv6i/spoilers_all_benjen_starks_secret_identity_theory/,"Alright everybody, get ready for this one... This is going to seem farfetched but at least this theory hasn't been discussed yet so it will give you something to ponder! Before I continue I would like to say that this theory came to me after reading the books and as the books are not with me at work right now nothing is referenced and therefore some details could be off (although this isn’t so much as a line for line theory as a bigger idea right now).


Benjen Stark's whereabouts always has intrigued me in large part because he went missing early on in the first novel and has yet to resurface.


The first option for Benjen that most people (myself included) go to is that he is Coldhands. Easy enough right? The child of the forest disproves this in my eyes by implying that Coldhands has been around for a lot longer than Benjen has been missing for. We all know that GRRM likes to disguise his characters as other characters and no character is ever dead without a firsthand account. By this logic I will make the argument that no, Benjen is not frozen to death in a ditch North of the Wall but instead he is in disguise as another character we know.


Well that raises a lot more questions since there are so many characters. Ones that can be ruled out immediately are people that would recognize Benjen. Therefore, he isn't with any of the Starks or with anyone familiar with the Stark family. Wow, that doesn't leave us many options now does it?

 
Before moving on with this I will also state that I believe Jon Snow is the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar. Also, Benjen was said to be close with Lyanna and therefore I will make the biggest assumption of this theory (please don't condemn me for this one): Benjen Stark is aware that John is Lyanna's son and that Lyanna loved Rhaegar (also an assumption, I know). The justification for this is that if Lyanna didn't ever make her feelings towards Rhaegar known to Benjen, Ned would. Why would Ned? To me it seems like why wouldn't Ned? Benjen is family and would deserve to know the truth about his sister and since he is safe on the wall, Ned wouldn't be paranoid that Benjen could let it slip after a few too many brews at the family reunion.

 
Okay so to summarize where our thought process is right now:


Benjen is alive and disguised as another character


Benjen is aware of Lyanna's relationship with Rhaegar and her Targaryen sympathy (she chose Rhaegar over her own brother and father even if unintentionally)


Alright so back to who could Benjen be in disguise? As already demonstrated by Barristan, Dany is the perfect victim to be fooled for a character in disguise. She was raised in Essos and literally is not familiar with most of the characters in Westeros and she is willingly accepting help from strangers (from her perspective) for the most part. Therefore it is conceivable that Benjen is with Dany and she has no idea.


The next question that this brings up is why would Benjen go to Dany? Here there is definitely room for interpretation so this next part is completely what I feel makes sense.


Benjen is the First Ranger of the Nights Watch. He understands the true magnitude of the danger (the Others) that the Seven Kingdoms is about to be faced with. If Benjen was to learn about Dany and her dragons he could reason that they would be a huge help in the coming war against Ice. How did Benjen learn of Dany and her dragons though? Ships from Essos occasionally make their way North so that's possible. Information tends to move through Varys so maybe he even suggested it to Benjen as a part of his grand scheme. Or maybe Benjen saw her in the fire similar to the way others have (I know Benjen hasn't had any Fire Priest tendencies before but this could be an exception). If Benjen knew of Lyanna’s love for Rhaegar and that they had a child together he would be much more receptive to helping Dany.


Okay, so if you've stuck with me to this point, Benjen possibly could have gone to Dany to help her and guide her to the wall where he knows she needs to be (by instinct, Varys or prophecy I don't know). Another side point to make is that Dany is unwillingly collecting a legendary assortment of individuals about her in preparation for her destiny. A Stark would definitely be an asset to her.


Who then could Benjen be if indeed he went to Dany? This is where the theory materializes.


I think that Benjen Stark is undercover as Daario Naharis. I can hear some of your screams of denial already. Why Daario you ask? That seems completely random and improbable!!! Yes, maybe that is true or maybe there's more to meet the eye.


First let's start with their appearances. Both seem to be of similar age and average build (warrior types smaller than the Hound/Mountain). Not saying much I know but at least they aren’t worlds apart. I believe both have blue eyes but once again I don’t have the book with me to quote anything. Both have beards and long hair (hardly a tell tale sign but still a match nonetheless). My next point convinces me the most however. Daario seems like he is in a disguise. Yes, technically all Tyroshi would seem that way but what better person for Benjen to pretend to be than a man that dyes his hair blue, has piercings and wears bright, distracting colors? One glance and you say ""Oh that's a Tyroshi sell sword"" and think nothing of it. If Benjen were to hide his appearance, a Tyroshi get up is the equivalent to a costume.


Alright so maybe these two guys look similar and maybe Benjen is posing as a Tyroshi sell sword as a disguise but how would it come about? The timeline seems to work for them both. Benjen disappeared early on and could have gone East and joined a mercenary band. He's a very capable fighter as are most Starks and particularly the First Ranger of the Night's Watch. Therefore it is believable that Benjen rose in the ranks of a mercenary group very quickly, just in time for Dany to come strolling along. The company had three leaders at the time so it seems as if the leaders are flexible and probably combat based (not as formal as the Golden Company per say). But before I continue on this thought let me jump away briefly.


I'm sure many of you are still feeling like Daario was just a random guess of who Benjen could be and you're right, it is. However, I have been suspicious of Daario right from the start. What are his motives? He meets Dany for the first time and immediately kills his fellow leaders to gain control of the mercenary band and support her. Why do this? Certainly sell swords are treacherous so the betrayal isn't the surprise but why betray his comrades to join Dany? She has dragons and she's hot and she has the makings of an army and potential to be Queen. If that's enough for you than you should stop reading this. If you are like me and you don't think it’s enough, let’s continue. A sell sword would want to see a return on his investment, in this case for supporting Dany. As Davos' pirate demonstrated, sell swords and pirates are typically not patient when it comes to compensation. Yet Daario is so patient and utterly loyal right from the beginning...... two characteristics that scream out to me as him being a fake sell sword!


If Daario is Benjen in disguise, his rapid loyalty and support for Dany makes sense. Having sex with her seems like a random thing for Benjen to do but if she is as hot as she sounds and Benjen wants to earn her trust why not? I definitely would in his situation. 


The next question one might have would be why would Benjen just abandon his brothers on the Night's Watch like this? He swore an oath to serve the realm until his death! Starks do not take oaths lightly. Well technically he still is keeping his oath. In fact, helping Dany and enlisting the best chance for help the Night's Watch has ever had is doing more for the realm than any of the boys freezing their dicks off on the wall. But why wouldn't he tell anyone? Well the Commander would probably argue he has more value on the wall than chasing a wannabe princess so faking his death would be the only option for an extended leave of absence like this. Once again, if Varys has a role in this, that would be the first thing he would suggest to do.


Another point is that Benjen's disappearance with Jon's arrival seems coincidental but what if it was intentional? It is said that a Stark must always be on the wall. Perhaps Benjen, knowing Jon's background and maybe he has some other insight as well about Jon's importance (Azor Ahai anyone?), needed to bring Jon to the wall prior to leaving to help Dany. Sure, some say that Benjen came to Winterfell due to the rarity and grandeur of the King coming North but there could be more to that as well. What if Benjen, privy to the fact that Robert was coming to drag Ned South, knew a visit to Jon would convince him to join him on the wall. By playing a little devil's advocate and saying the wall will always be there for him, he gambled that Jon would be more excited rather than deterred. Benjen might not have known for sure if it would work but maybe once Jon joined the Night's Watch so quickly Benjen was able to proceed with his bigger plans and head East.


So to summarize a bit, I think that Benjen Stark is Daario Naharis in disguise because:


1) It is likely Benjen is alive and another character (GRRM's style).


2) Dany is ignorant about the people in Westeros making Benjen joining her possible and also she is important making Benjen's purpose more plausible.


3) Daario hasn't behaved like a typical sell sword would and his dyed beard and piercings would make a perfect disguise for Benjen.


4) Benjen must have a bigger role to play in the grand scheme of things or he would have been found dead already. What bigger role could he have than helping Dany bring the dragons to the wall and save the Seven Kingdoms from the Others?


I think that covers all I wanted to say AND I effectively wasted an hour at work. Double success. Let me know what you guys think if any of you have the heart or stomach to get through this and try not to ruthlessly rip it apart since I haven’t even reread the books with this theory in mind. Sorry for the length of the post but I wanted to convey all of my thoughts since this theory is walking on thin ice (pun intended).

EDIT: Something to consider as well that I thought of after that some of you might find interesting would be that Benjen=Daario would have very strong parallels with Jon going undercover with the wildlings. Both had to abandon their brothers in a time of need for a greater cause, both had to lie about being brothers of the Nights Watch and both even had to forsake their vow to never have sex for the success of their missions (once again assuming Benjen/Daario did so in order to gain her trust and protect her). Also related to protecting her, if Benjen was a pawn of Varys maybe it was Varys' idea to gain a mercenary group so that Dany had more soldiers at her disposal for her protection.

edit: I've had a few people asking why I didn't make a map of the entire world, well, there are a few reasons. First, all of the 'complete' maps that I've seen are fan-created &amp; not from the books, so I'm not sure if they're 100% accurate with either scale or placement.

Now, I'm going to assume that the man who ""rescued"" Theon (Iwan Rheon) is, in fact, Ramsay. Episode 3 took me by surprise because Ramsay rescues Theon again... despite my belief that he would simply hunt him down (just like in the books). 

After watching the episode 4 preview (link below), there's a scene where Ramsay is leading Theon to a castle where he claim's Asha (Yara in the TV show) is waiting for him. I immediately thought Deepwood Motte. However, in Episode 2, when Theon is freed from what is presumably the Dreadfort, Ramsay tells him to ride east. 

The only castle east of the Dreadfort... is Karhold. 

Now here's my suspicions: they've been playing up the Karstarks as a force that is slowly moving away from Robb. Could it be that the Bastard gets unveiled at the same time that they reveal an alliance between Bolton and Karstark against Robb? Is the bastard in league with the karstarks?

Our community has grown quite a bit since the last time the issue of piracy came up here at /r/asoiaf. I thought a reminder of the rules in this regard was especially needed in light of the recent release of [*The Lands of Ice and Fire*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lands-Fire-Game-Thrones/dp/0345538544).

The rule is quite simple and was agreed upon by the community a long, long time ago: **no form of piracy is tolerated on the Wall**. Links to torrent files, .pdf files, *.jpg files, or any other files/links that provide copyright infringed media will result in warnings and/or bans. Trying to find clever ways to circumvent this rule will result in a ban with no warning.

This includes the maps from the new [*The Lands of Ice and Fire*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lands-Fire-Game-Thrones/dp/0345538544) book. Posting a picture of the book itself is fine. Posting pictures of the maps the book contains is not.

&gt; **But Maester! Why have pictures of maps been allowed in the past?!**

&gt;&gt; The maps that have been featured here in the past were fan created images that were available all over the Internet. The maps in the new book are ""official"" maps that are copyrighted. We suspect Martin and his publishers aren't going to take kindly to them being disseminated without their permission.

&gt; **But you let a link to that app of a Westeros map a fellow redditor made stay up for a long time!**

&gt;&gt;We allowed that on the false assumption that since it was in the iTunes app store it was kosher. When that app was mysteriously removed from the store we learned better. We suspect its creator either took it down voluntarily or Apple removed it themselves probably for, you guessed it, copyright issues.

&gt;**Don't act so high and mighty about copyrights! Some of the most popular threads around here include quotes directly from the books and you allow those to stay.**

&gt;&gt;Those are not copyright violations. Look up ""fair use"" when you get a chance.

&gt;**I don't care about your rules, I'll do what I want!**

&gt;&gt;Fetch me a block.

I know that this rule doesn't affect the vast majority of you but history has proven that there is a small minority of people in any reddit community who think it's cool to put the whole subreddit at risk by violating the law, reddit's TOS, and the subreddit's own rules by posting pirated materials. We Maesters would appreciate it if you Rangers out there would **utilize the report button** to flag any comment and/or post that is in violation of this policy.

Let me say that again: **please use the report button on any post or comment that even hints at piracy on the Wall**! You are the swords in the darkness and your watch will not end until your death.

This build up allows for the full force of Ned's death and the Red Wedding to really hit home.

Like many though, I think that the Starks are likely to make a 'comeback' in the coming books, and its interesting to consider how this might occur, given that they are scattered all over the place.

I have therefore developed something of a theory based on the apparent parallel's between the storyline of the Starks, and that this could continue in the future. Apologies if this has been brought up previously and done to death!

One could argue that Jon (who most likely is a Stark one way or another) and even Rickon could be included in this. However, I think Jon's role in the series is seperate, and that the lack of Rickon information makes it hard to say, and I am also wary of merely fitting evidence to suit my theory. So I have focussed on Arya, Bran and Sansa.

The theme is perhaps most strong in Arya's storyline but I think all three have significant parallels.

All 3 of these character's have ended up in positions where they are learning a set of skills that are very specific, hard to come by and can be immensely useful in the future:

Arya- how to be a Faceless Man

Bran- the art of Greenseeing

Sansa- how to play the Game of Thrones

It is also interesting how these skills match the personality traits and characters that we met from an early stage. Arya was always quick on her feet, intelligent, had a keen sense of justice, stealthy, wished she was a fighter etc. Bran loved to climb Winterfell so he could look down on the whole castle and he revelled in knowing the secret passages. Sansa loved the Southern courtesies and knowing the right thing to say, as well as the heraldry.

They are also all being taught these skills by experts in their given fields:

Arya- The Kindly Man who is clearly one of the most learned in the arts of the Faceless Men

Bran- Bloodraven who, to our knowledge, is one of the only Greenseers and has huge knowledge

Sansa- Littlefinger who has been repeatedly presented as the master of politics and the ultimate Machiavellian character.

One could easily argue that they are being taught by the very best in their field.

So what do these parallels mean for their possible futures? Well I think we are already given hints about what lies ahead, most strongly in Arya's story:

The names recited are a clear indication she has 'unfinished business', the hiding of needle also demonstrates that she couldn't leave her past entirely behind her, the warging into a cat also suggest that in some way she is straying from the expected path, furthemore Nymeria is still lost in Westeros and a reunion could still be on the cards. I therefore think that at some point its likely Arya will turn her back on the faceless men and return to Westeros with a whole heap of deadly talents.

There have also been hints as to Sansa's growing confidence and ability. Her story thus far has been pretty low key in that she hasn't achieved much. From the very beginning she frustrated us by being disloyal to Arya when talking about the fight with Joffrey, generally following Lannister orders and not doing enough. Many have already theorised that she is likely to turn her back on Littlefinger (I don't want to rehash these theories as I'm sure most have been read). Again, she could therefore end up with a bunch of political skills to use to the Starks advantage.

Bran has been lead north essentially on Jojen Reeds advice. He does not appear to have any long term plans, beyond learning about Greenseeing. However, I think many would agree that Bloodraven and the CotF are quite sinister and not perhaps as 'good' as one might initially have thought. I think there is a good chance that Bran's fate will therefore continue to mirror that of his sister's and he will also turn his back on his master, who appears to want him to become a greenseer sitting in a tree too (I just don't think this is Bran). 

Quite how this would work I am not sure, but I believe there is a strong possibility that each of them will fundamentally remember that they are Starks, and that they can't leave their pasts behind. They are therefore going to abandon their tutor's who all have very different ideas for their futures, and return with a set of skills that can make the Stark's great again.

Maybe this is just wishful thinking though! What do you think?

**XI. Why Sleeping Dogs Won't Lie**


Something I noticed while rereading Brienne's chapters in ASOS, AFFC, and ADWD, is that 'the Hound' keeps popping up, even though the last time we saw him, he was in very bad shape. Throughout AFFC, there are confused reports that the Hound has been terrorizing the Riverlands, particularly the town of Saltpans, in a way that's reminiscent of the Mountain's depravities in AGOT: 

AFFC, Chapter 12/Cersei III:

&gt;...The bird had come last night, from a septry on an island hard by the mouth of the Trident. The nearby town of Saltpans had been savagely raided by a band of outlaws, and some of the survivors claimed a roaring brute in a hound’s head helm was amongst the raiders. Supposedly he’d killed a dozen men and raped a girl of twelve.

Chapter 16/Jaime II:  

&gt;...Sandor Clegane is raiding along the Trident, it would seem. Your sister wants his head. It may be that he has joined Dondarrion.”
&gt;Jaime had heard about Saltpans. By now half the realm had heard. The raid had been exceptionally savage. Women raped and mutilated, children butchered in their mothers’ arms, half the town put to the torch.

Chapter 25/Brienne V:

&gt;“We only seek one outlaw,” Brienne said. “The Hound.”

&gt;“So Ser Hyle told me. May the Seven save you, child. It’s said he leaves a trail of butchered babes and ravished maids behind him. The Mad Dog of Saltpans, I have heard him called.

Chapter 28/Cersei VI:

&gt;“Some of my sparrows speak of bands of lions who despoiled them... and of the Hound, who was your own sworn man. At Saltpans he slew an aged septon and despoiled a girl of twelve, an innocent child promised to the Faith. He wore his armor as he raped her and her tender flesh was torn and crushed by his iron mail. When he was done he gave her to his men, who cut off her nose and nipples.”

Chapter 30/Jaime IV:

&gt;What they were describing sounded more like Gregor’s work than Sandor’s. Sandor had been hard and brutal, yes, but it was his big brother who was the real monster in House Clegane. 

&gt;“He was seen,” Ser Arwood said. “That helm of his is not easily mistaken, nor forgotten, and there were a few who survived to tell the tale. The girl he raped, some boys who hid, a woman we found trapped beneath a blackened beam, the fisherfolk who watched the butchery from their boats...”

&gt;“Do not call it butchery,” Lady Mariya said softly. “That gives insult to honest butchers everywhere. Saltpans was the work of some fell beast in human skin.”

&gt;This is a time for beasts, Jaime reflected, for lions and wolves and angry dogs, for ravens and carrion crows.

...

During her encounter with Timeon, Shagwell, and Pyg, Brienne learned that the Hound had a Stark girl with him and had last been seen at the inn at the crossroads. Brienne thought the girl was Sansa, but it was actually Arya. Unbeknownst to Brienne, this information is old. Readers know Arya has long since escaped Sandor Clegane and has been in Braavos. 

Arya had left Sandor Clegane dying on the banks of the Trident, near Saltpans. He was found there by the Elder Brother, who later told Brienne, ""The Hound died there, in my arms"" (AFFC 31/Brienne VI). But it's likely he was speaking metaphorically--the tormented warrior called 'the Hound' died, but Sandor Clegane survived his wounds and was taken to the Quiet Isle to be a brother. The Elder Brother is well aware that many people are hunting Clegane and that Sandor no longer has Arya with him. He wants to both protect Sandor and help Brienne:

&gt;The man you hunt is dead.”

&gt;...“How did he die?”

&gt;“By the sword, as he had lived.”

&gt;“You know this for a certainty?”

&gt;“I buried him myself. I can tell you where his grave lies, if you wish. I covered him with stones to keep the carrion eaters from digging up his flesh, and set his helm atop the cairn to mark his final resting place. That was a grievous error. Some other wayfarer found my marker and claimed it for himself. The man who raped and killed at Saltpans was not Sandor Clegane, though he may be as dangerous. The riverlands are full of such scavengers. I will not call them wolves. Wolves are nobler than that... and so are dogs, I think. (AFFC 31/Brienne VI)

Later in the same conversation, the Elder Brother told Brienne about how he had 'died' at the battle of the Trident:

&gt;All in all, I was a sad man. When I was not fighting, I was drunk. My life was writ in red, in blood and wine.”

&gt;“When did it change?” asked Brienne.

&gt;“When I died in the Battle of the Trident....I heard hooves behind my back...but before I could turn something slammed into my head and knocked me back into the river, where by rights I should have drowned.

&gt;“Instead I woke here, upon the Quiet Isle...I had washed up on the tide, naked as my name day. I can only think that someone found me in the shallows, stripped me of my armor, boots, and breeches, and pushed me back out into the deeper water. The river did the rest. We are all born naked, so I suppose it was only fitting that I come into my second life the same way...” (AFFC 31/Brienne VI)

The Elder Brother was probably not lying about having dug a grave for the Hound. I think he buried Clegane's arms and armor and other belongings in order to symbolically bury his former life. In this way, Sandor too could 'wash up' on the Quiet Isle, naked and reborn. Brienne may have actually seen him at one point without realizing it. Remember that Sandor had been wounded in the thigh during his fight with Polliver and the Tickler (""He was bleeding like a butchered pig...and dragging one leg when he walked"" ASOS 74/Arya XIII) and that he's fond of dogs:

&gt;...they passed a lichyard where a brother bigger than Brienne was struggling to dig a grave. From the way he moved, it was plain to see that he was lame. As he flung a spadeful of the stony soil over one shoulder, some chanced to spatter against their feet. “Be more watchful there,” chided Brother Narbert. “Septon Meribald might have gotten a mouthful of dirt.” The gravedigger lowered his head. When Dog went to sniff him he dropped his spade and scratched his ear.

&gt;“A novice,” explained Narbert. (AFFC 31/Brienne VI)

It's significant that Sandor is last seen in a lichyard, burying someone. As the Hound, he killed countless people (ACOK 52/Sansa IV). As Sandor, he will spend his days burying them. But one could also interpret that scene as one in which Sandor was putting his old self to rest.

Unfortunately, the Hound did not truly die in the Elder Brother's arms. 'The Hound' has transcended Sandor Clegane and become a sort of malignant spirit possessing those who don the snarling dog's head helm. Those who have chosen to show the Hound's face to the world have behaved more like beasts than men. The first Hound

&gt;...was a bitter, tormented soul, a sinner who mocked both gods and men. He served, but found no pride in service. He fought, but took no joy in victory. He drank, to drown his pain in a sea of wine. He did not love, nor was he loved himself. It was hate that drove him. Though he committed many sins, he never sought forgiveness. Where other men dream of love, or wealth, or glory, this man Sandor Clegane dreamed of slaying his own brother, a sin so terrible it makes me shudder just to speak of it....Ignoble as it was, the hope of seeing his brother’s blood upon his blade was all this sad and angry creature lived for... and even that was taken from him, when Prince Oberyn of Dorne stabbed Ser Gregor with a poisoned spear (AFFC 31/Brienne VI).

Interestingly, it wasn't until *after* Brienne learned about his death that she encountered the Hound. She was attacked by the second Hound (Rorge, who's wearing Sandor's old helm) at the inn at the crossroads. She fights him and Thoros of Myr later confirms that ""The Hound is dead and buried"" (AFFC 42/Brienne VIII). Yet while she was being held captive by Lady Stoneheart's band, Brienne saw the Hound again:

&gt;One of the shadow men shoved the girl aside. He was clad in rusted rings and a studded belt. At his hip hung longsword and dirk. A yellow greatcloak was plastered to his shoulders, sodden and filthy. From his shoulders rose a steel dog’s head, its teeth bared in a snarl.

&gt;“No,” Brienne moaned. “No, you’re dead, I killed you.”

&gt;The Hound laughed. “You got that backwards. It’ll be me killing you. I’d do it now, but m’lady wants to see you hanged.” (AFFC 42/Brienne VIII)

This third Hound turns out to be Lem Lemoncloak:

&gt;The biggest of the four wore a stained and tattered yellow cloak. “Enjoy the food?” he asked. “I hope so. It’s the last food you’re ever like to eat.” He was brown-haired, bearded, brawny, with a broken nose that had healed badly. I know this man, Brienne thought. “You are the Hound.”

&gt;He grinned. His teeth were awful; crooked, and streaked brown with rot. “I suppose I am. Seeing as how m’lady went and killed the last one.” (AFFC 42/Brienne VIII)

Notice how Lem seems like a scarier figure now. Back in Arya's chapters in ASOS, he was just a grumpy guy in a yellow cloak. Now he's being portrayed as vicious and literally rotting. He is happy to wear the same helm that Rorge had worn while terrorizing the Riverlands. Thoros is deeply disturbed when he sees that Lem is now wearing it:

&gt;“There is nothing good about that helm, nor the men who wore it,” said the red priest. “Sandor Clegane was a man in torment, and Rorge a beast in human skin.”

&gt;“I’m not them.”

&gt;“Then why show the world their face? Savage, snarling, twisted... is that who you would be, Lem?”

&gt;“The sight of it will make my foes afraid.”

&gt;“The sight of it makes me afraid.” (AFFC 42/Brienne VIII)

1361803095.0,238,self.asoiaf,196yjj,(Spoilers All) Ser Robert Strong and a certain King's blood.,pimpst1ck,313,75,179,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/196yjj/spoilers_all_ser_robert_strong_and_a_certain/,"So its fair to assume that Ser Robert Strong is in fact the reanimated corpse of Ser Gregor Clegane, or UnGregor.  Yet I've seen another intriguing theory floating around regarding what exactly is under Ser Robert's helm.  This theory suggests that Ser Robert Strong is in fact the corpse of Ser Gregor Clegane with Robb Stark's head sewn on top.  The base evidence for this theory is as follows.

* Ser Gregor's skull was allegedly sent to Prince Doran Martell to appease them (although some speculate is was actually Oppo's skull, the malformed dwarf performer at Joffrey's wedding)

* Grey Wind's head was sewn onto Robb's corpse after the Red Wedding, yet the fate of Robb's head was not mentioned.  This works as a Chekov's gun.  The mention of Robb's and Grey Wind's mutual decapitation served at least one purpose - to prevent any rumours of Robb surviving by warging into Grey Wind, but it also points out that Robb's head was cut off and we don't know what happened to it - surely if it was put on a spike it would be mentioned and it probably wouldn't have just been tossed aside.

* It makes sense for the Lannisters to be in possession of Robb's skull, as proof that the Frey's and Boltons did the deed (remember they were former servants of Robb), also note much writing was dedicated to Cersei wish to have Tyrion's head for his crimes.

* The name.  The word 'Stark' in German can be translated to mean Strong.  Thus Robb Stark = Robert Strong, a veiled code name for the reader.

Just as a quick aside I'll explain why I doubt the head sent to Doran was Oppo's, and also why I doubt Gregor still has his head.  

* Whilst it was malformed like Oppos, so was Gregors.  That's a very weak piece of evidence.  Furthermore, Gregor suffered from Giantism and Oppo Dwarfism.  Even though both had misformed bone structures, I still doubt Oppo's skull would be big enough.

* Bran's vision in AGOT speaks of ""a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood"".  It's quite clear this is mentioning the Mountain who Rides after being poisoned by Oberyn (black blood).  Whilst the reference to 'nothing in the helm' could simply mean Ser Robert Strong has no head and that's why his visor is always shut, it clearly alludes to Ser Gregor being decapitated.  Thus it makes it far more likely for Ser Robert Strong to have a new head, thus involving decapitation at some point, rather than never being decapitated at all.

**NOW FOR THE MAIN PART OF MY THEORY**

It is well known that King's blood is a powerful agent in blood magic.  It was most likely Khal Drogo's blood that accidently caused the hatching of Danaerys' dragons.  However the fiasco with Khal Drogo also proves that inferior blood used in blood magic results in a inferior result.  Mirri Maz Duur's use of a stallion's blood to merely save Drogo from death resulted in him awakening in a vegetative state.  Also remember that Dany offered her own life to save Drogo's thinking:

 &gt;She told herself she would die for him, if she must  She was the blood of the dragon, she would not be afraid.

Yet Mirri Maz Duur refuses, even though she has the blood of Kings, as considering she planned to put Drogo in a vegetative state, she would need to use inferior blood.

So if the inferior blood of a stallion cannot succeed in preventing a sick man from dying, clearly a much more powerful blood is needed to resurrect a dead man, especially one the size of Ser Gregor Clegane.

Qyburn is well-versed in necromancy, and it's most likely the magic he used to resurrect Ser Gregor Clegane was blood magic, especially considering he has a taste for torture and mutilation and blood magic being the most prevalent in the series.  He is also alluded to his knowledge of magic, as he remarked that Oberyn most likely used magic in his poison to lengthen Ser Gregor's death.

Thus if Qyburn wished to reanimate Ser Gregor to create the ""unbeatable champion"" for Cersei, he can't have just used any inferior blood.  I theorize that only the blood of a king would be powerful enough to reanimate a dead corpse, especially one such as Gregor, with enough mental capacity to fight and follow orders.  The only unaccounted notable source of King's blood we know of so far is Robb Stark's head (which has had a suspicious lack of mention), and sewing the head onto the corpse of Ser Gregor certainly seems a solid way to provide this magic.

Another thematic piece of evidence is the idea of king's blood waking stone.  Khal Drogo's blood awakened Danaerys' dragon eggs, which had been turned to stone.  Melisandre wishes to use Edric Storm's blood to awake stone dragons.  Wouldn't it be very thematically consistent for Robb Stark's king blood to awaken the ""giant in armor made of stone"", the Mountain who Rides?

Now I know our knowledge of resurrection is limited, especially in regards to Thoros and Beric Dondarrion, but I've pieced together what I know and think I've given a good case for what I'll call Ser UnGregor Stark.  It's not conclusive by any means, but this is the evidence I've accumulated.  Thoughts?",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,TheImp,True,t3_196yjj,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/196yjj/spoilers_all_ser_robert_strong_and_a_certain/,
1354392686.0,237,self.asoiaf,14470f,(Spoilers All) The second most powerful house in each region,Kordyon,283,46,168,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/14470f/spoilers_all_the_second_most_powerful_house_in/,"I was thinking about the great houses and liege lords of each of the regions of Westeros.  At the beginning of AGoT we have the Starks, Tullys, Arryns, Greyjoys, Lannisters, Baratheons, Tyrells, and Martells.  By the end of ADwD, the Starks number four + Jon, the Tullys are down to the Blackfish, Edmure, and Edmure's child, the only living Baratheons excluding Robert's bastards are Stannis and Shireen, only five Greyjoys remain, and twitchy little Sweetrobin is the last of the Arryn line.


If any of these families are extinguished, or are completely removed from power such as the Tullys, Arryns, and (temporarily) Starks, then which houses stand to become the most powerful in the region?  I am not asking which houses will necessarily be given the rule, but rather which is most powerful. For example, Littlefinger is technically the Lord Paramount of the Riverlands, but that does not make his house powerful, as he has no armies and the Riverlords do not seem to respect his authority in any way.

So who are the second most powerful houses in each region?

-
The Riverlands: House Frey. 
-

I'm starting here because it seems to be the most obvious.  The Freys are rich and powerful from the tolls they have collected from the crossing over the years.  They were able to amass approximately 4000 men when Edmure first called the banners way back in AGoT.  For all the fighting in the Riverlands, the Freys haven't experienced terrible losses and they still represent the biggest fighting force of any of the Riverlands houses.  Furthermore, after Edmure's surrender, Riverrun was given to Emmon Frey, and I believe that the Riverlords will ultimately follow whoever holds Riverrun, not LF and Harrenhal.  I actually believe that the Freys are the most powerful ""non-Great"" house in this list.

Honorable Mention: House Mallister

-
The Vale: House Royce.  
-

Stinky Pinky's machinations aside, the Royces are a very old and very respected house with multiple powerful branches.  We are only just starting to get an accurate view of the politics of the Vale thanks to the Sansa POVs, but the Royces seem to be the house that is looked to for leadership now that Jon Arryn is dead.  If LF's schemes fall flat, I believe Bronze Yohn is the clear frontrunner for stewardship and possibly lordship of the Vale.

Honorable Mentions: House Hunter, House Waynwood, House Corbray

-
The North: House Bolton.  
-
The Boltons are the clear winners in this category by the end of ADwD, but that may be only because of the cold genius of Roose Bolton, and to a lesser extent the actions of Ramsay Snow.  At the beginning of AGoT, I feel as if this category would be a toss up between the Umbers, the Boltons, and the Karstarks in terms of sheer numbers/strength.  However, this is definitely a case of brains over brawns and R&amp;R Bolton have definitely cemented themselves as the house to beat in the North.

Honorable Mentions: House Umber, House Karstark

-
The Iron Islands: House Harlaw.  
-
This is a case where being the most powerful won't necessarily equate to being the ruler.  Rodrik Harlaw seems to be one of the most intelligent men on the Iron Islands (with the exception of Euron), and he is certainly the most educated, but he doesn't seem as if he would be a likely contender in any kingsmoot.  The Isle of Harlaw is the second largest  in the Iron Islands and it features 5 keeps, including Ser Rodrik's home of Ten Towers.  All of the other houses on the Isle of Harlaw pledge fealty to Ser Rodrik.  All of these things combine to make House Harlaw the second most powerful on the Iron Islands, but the Ironborn seem more impressed with powerful individuals than powerful houses.

-
The Reach: House Hightower.  
-
This was a tough one to decide.  The Redwynes have played a big role in the story so far as being the naval power behind the Tyrell strength.  However, it has been stated that Leyton Hightower could summon three times as many men as any other Tyrell bannerman and even more if he picked Oldtown clean.  Also, the fact that the Hightowers have kept out of the conflict so far means that they probably have the most strength remaining of any non-Tyrell House in the Reach.  Also, the Arbor has already been attacked by the Ironborn and the Redwyne fleet will certainly sustain further losses at the hands of Euron Crow's Eye before all is said and done.  Add this to the fact that, as an island, the Arbor is slightly isolated from the rest of the Reach, whereas Oldtown is on the mainland and I think that we have to recognize House Hightower as the No. 2 in the Reach behind the Tyrells.

Honorable Mentions: House Redwyne, House Tarly

-
Dorne: House Yronwood.  
-
Yronwood is at an important strategic position at the mouth of the Boneway Pass so it has been the ancient responsibility of House Yronwood to guard the pass against intruders from the North.  This has been a very important task given the long-time on and off conflict between the Reach and Dorne.  Thus, House Yronwood has become both respected and strong.  Also, it says a lot that Doran Martell would send his firstborn to foster with House Yronwood in order to cement and repair relations with them.

Honorable Mention: House Dayne

-
The Westerlands: Undecided. 
-
 I tried doing some research on this one and I am unable to come to a firm conclusion.  It seems to me that the Lannisters are so dominant and prolific in the Westerlands that they allow their bannermen as little power as possible.  Possibilities include House Brax, House Swyft, House Crakehall, House Clegane, and House Payne.  Of these, I would probably pick House Brax, but I would love to hear any other ideas on this.

-
Crownlands/Stormlands: House Velaryon. 
- 
If I remember correctly, House Velaryon comprised the largest component of Stannis' fleet in the Battle of the Blackwater.  They are a very old and respected house.  Like the Targaryens they contain ancient Valyrian blood.  They seem to command some level of navel power, which makes their island home of Driftmark very defensible.  Should Stannis die or be removed from power, I imagine that the Velaryons would attempt to take control of Dragonstone.  Furthermore, Aurane Waters is currently MIA with the newly made Royal Fleet and he is a bastard of House Velaryon.  We do not know how loyal he is to House Velaryon, but he could be a wildcard asset for them.

Honorable Mentions: House Swann, House Estermont, House Dondarrion.


Anyway, I know this was a wall of text, but I thought I'd put it out there and I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on my choices and maybe some theories as to what might happen to these houses if their liege lords are taken out of the picture.

***

Would people be interested in a regular (every 1-2 weeks) topic thread where we host a *moderated* debate on a specific subject? The difference between this type of debate and your average back-and-forth is that the debate is moderated, more structured, and follows a specific set of rules. Also, a winner is chosen based on voting.

First we would select our debate topic, then our moderator for the debate, and then our champions arguing for each side. The moderators and champions would self-nominate and then be selected by the community based on votes. Once selected they would have a week or so to prepare for the debate and compile their opening statements. The same champions couldn't be selected for consecutive debates, just so we don't see the same people arguing every topic. I was thinking only one champion per side for simplicity, but if the topic calls for it we could do 2-on-2.

It would follow an adapted version of the Oxford style debate format. If you're familiar with the popular Intelligence Squared debates they follow the same format. It goes as follows:

1. **Moderator Opening Words:** Introduce proposition and give brief background information.
* **Opening Vote:** Users vote on proposition (for, against, or undecided) and votes are tallied.
* **Opening Statements:** Pre-written opening statements from both sides (limited word count).
* **Floor Debate:** Moderator questions, champions back-and-forth, user submitted questions (selected by moderator). The moderator sets the pace, number of questions, and can decide if a topic needs to move on to a different area. Predetermined time limit for all of this (~1-2 hours).
* **Closing Arguments:** Each champion presents his/her last argument.
* **Closing Vote:** Users vote on proposition one last time.
* **Winner Declared:** The winner of the debate is the side that *sways* the highest percentage of people to their side.

To clarify how a winner is determined, let me give an example... The topic being argued is Benjen=Daario and the opening vote is 6% for, 86% against, and 8% undecided. The closing vote is 10% for, 88% against, and 2% undecided. The winner would be the champion arguing for Benjen=Daario, because his/her arguments swayed more people.

The type of debate topics I had in mind would be along the lines of:

* Sexism in ASOIAF
* Who is the better player, Varys or Littlefinger?
* Is [blank] (e.g. Stannis, Dany, Jon) a good/bad ruler?
* Various contested theories (e.g. R+L=J, Blackfyre theory)

I'm sure there are plenty of good debate topics we could choose from. So is this something that interests people? If so I can put it all together, or one of the mods can take it over if they want to make it an official /r/asoiaf thing.

Long read!",oddment,310,72,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1jzp1i/spoilers_all_while_reading_the_five_books_i_wrote/,"Once upon a time, I saw the first season of GOT. I got hooked and bought the five books. But halfway through GoT, I came across R+L=J and, feeling thoroughly spoilered, I didn't continue after finishing GoT. A year later, I picked the series up again, this time with a notepad. Be aware that some notes were written mid-chapter. Page numbers are from the US paperbacks.

**A GAME OF THRONES**

* The man with the yellow beard Arya follows in the dungeons – Lannister?
* I think Robb &amp; Catelyn will have to, in essence, sacrifice Sansa, i.e. do something that makes Cersei/Joff kill her.
* R + L = J and that’s a fact. [[I don't remember exactly what this was a response to?]]
* Not that it’s important, but Brynden Blackfish Tully is either gay or asexual, I wonder which. 
* Mya Stone, Robert’s first bastard in the Vale, is DEFINITELY going to pop up later.
* Old Mormont says Jorah was married to a “vain woman”(pg 561) – who?
* It seems weird that Robb isn’t a narrator and yet playing such an important part. It’d also be a waste of narrator if Bran did nothing important. So I think in a few books’ time when Bran’s old enough, Robb dies and Bran becomes Lord of Winterfell / King in the North. IF the narrators are consistent between books, that is! Bah, they probably aren’t.
* Ew, Jon Arryn married his cousin.
* Hypothesis: Everybody mentioned in the appendix will be at least mentioned in the actual books. This explains bannermen and such, but it also means we should keep an eye out for the bastards mentioned! They are:
 * Mya Stone
 * Joy (father: Gerion Lannister)
 * Garse&amp;Garrett Flowers (father: Garth Tyrell)
* Ending thought: It's really heartbreaking how Tyrion is essentially paying Shae to be his girlfriend.
* Something I noticed: Whenever a character dreams about the future, either they die or their plans go very sour in that same chapter.

**A CLASH OF KINGS**

* This prologue has nothing to do with anything or anybody I know.
* Okay no, Stannis is there.
* I wonder if Melisandre used magic/miracle or just had built up an immunity?
* Some way or another, Arya won't reach Winterfell.
* Yup, complications arose.
* Are you allowed to root for Tyrion, Dany and the Starks at the same time?
* Theon *will* be forced to go against the Starks. And have to choose. And it *won't* be an easy choice.
* Littlefinger is DEFINITELY the chessmaster. He has the money, and money equals power. BUT WHY DID HE LIE ABOUT THE KNIFE? *WHY?*
* Dontos just offered Sansa a way home. She's dreaming about the future. It will not happen.
* I'm at page 334, and I've had 1 Dany chapter, 1 Theon (and 1 Davos). I wonder how they're doing?
* Arya will never reach Winterfell, because then her narration would be redundant with Bran's.
* Theon is such a manwhore but holy shit he's funny!
* THIS IS SO GROSS AND UNCOMFORTABLE I HATE ASHA
* ...I kinda want *Tyrion* as King-in-the-South (and Robb in the North, obviously)
* Dany will be so disappointed when she actually sees the Seven Kingdoms.
* Well holy fuck Renly just died. This ""Light God"" is evil sorcery. Reminds me of Mirri Maz Duur - Melisandre must be a maegi because of the deadly shadows.
* That green dream - if Bran&amp;Rickon die, and Robb's at war so he might die too, who'll rule as Stark? And what'll Theon do if it comes to it?
* Seems like I had too much faith in Theon's Starkness.
* Pg 571, who's Lysa's ""stripling""?
* Pg 623, WTF JUST HAPPENED (Melisandre birthing an evil murdershadow)
* Pg 706, Dany is at the Undying Ones, they show her visions. She just saw Rhaegar's death. Says he murmurs a woman's name with his last breath - I bet it's ""Lyanna"".
* Characters and their Hogwarts Houses:
 * Catelyn - Hufflepuff (because family and duty)
 * Robb&amp;Ned - Gryffindor (this is what killed Ned!)
 * Sam Tarly - Ravenclaw, obviously
 * Every single Lannister except Joffrey - Slytherin (this is not a bad thing, I like Tyrion)
 * Littlefinger - Slytherin I guess? We don't know his plans and motives and values, but he's *such* a chessmaster.
* Jon's too much like Ned, he just let Ygritte the Wildling go. Which might be the honorable thing to do, but he's going to get them all killed now.
* Well FUCK. Bran &amp; Rickon are dead. FUCK Theon Greyjoy, I hope he DIES.
* Catelyn-talking-to-Jaime, great scene. Though it seems like it, she won't kill him.
* BRAN &amp; RICKON AREN'T DEAD! THEY LIVE! I still want Theon and the other Greyjoys to die or at least lose, though.
* Dear Cersei, please don't kill Sansa, it'd be strategic suicide.
* Theon's feeling so sorry for himself, but the stupid idiot brought this on himself.
* Hah, there are 4 pages of Walder Frey's descendants.
* 2nd book is now over, and we *still* don't know what side Littlefinger is chessmaster for (why did he lie about the dagger?) The longer GRRM waits, the more I'm expecting.

Safe to say that if something is impossible as the show presents, it will not be revealed in future books.

That said:

**Robb Stark's wife and heir have been hiding under the protection of the Blackfish**: Man oh man did they go out of their way to make this one clear. Ned Stark has no grandchildren, ok we get it.

**Robb named Jon his heir**: This one may still be true in the books, but I don't think that letter is ever going to be a plot point.

**Too little, too late on Beric's resurrection resulted in Crazy-bitch Catelyn**: Yeah.... Michelle Fairly did a great job showing that Cat snapped like a shattered glass before she'd even died. What came back from Beric's kiss was a broken, vengeful, unable-to-trust wraith because of the things that happened to Cat before her death, not in the days afterward.

I've gone through and collected pretty much every instance of dreaming throughout the series. Most of these dreams aren't prophetic in any sort of way, but even so, they still provide interesting insight into the characters' state of mind.

I decided not to include some of Bran's later warging dreams, because some of them are quite long, and I think once he's aware of his ability the distinction between warging and dreaming becomes a bit more defined.

If there's anything I missed or any inaccuracies please let me know and feel free to add.

Regarding identity and becoming a Faceless Man: 

The common belief is that in order for Arya, or anyone, to become a FM, she must give up her whole identity and sincerely become ""no one."" However, while doing a combined AFFC/ADWD re-read, this passage in AFFC with Arya and the waif really stood out to me:

&gt;One day at supper [the waif] turned to Arya and asked, ""Who are you?""
&gt;""No one,"" Arya answered, in Braavosi.
&gt;""You lie,"" said the waif. ""You must lie gooder.""
&gt;Arya laughed. ""Gooder? You mean *better*, stupid.""
&gt;""Better stupid. I will show you.""
&gt;The next day they began the lying game, asking questions of one another, taking turns. Sometimes they would answer truly, sometimes they would lie. The questioner had to try and tell what was true and what was false. The waif always seemed to know. Arya had to guess. Most of the time she guessed wrong. 

- AFFC, Ch. 22, Kindle edition page 363

This made me think that perhaps she *doesn't* have to become no one. ""Who are you?"" ""No one."" ""You lie."" She has to learn how to lie well enough that this obvious lie - because no one is truly no one - is believed to be the truth.

blue roses and a white gown spattered with gore** could only be Lyanna. Her brother Brandon stood beside her, and their father Lord Rickard
just behind. Along the walls figures half-seen moved through the shadows, pale shades with long grim faces. The sight of them sent fear
shivering through Theon sharp as a knife. And then the tall doors opened with a crash, and a freezing gale blew down the hall, and Robb
came walking out of the night. Grey Wind stalked beside, eyes burning, and **man and wolf alike bled from half a hundred savage wounds.**""

There is a lot of theories about Patchface predicting the Red Wedding but not Theon. He is having dinner with the dead and yet Robb is there. He sees all the wounds of Robb and Greywind get. He even sees the colors of Lyanna's dress and flowers. He should not know these things. He is a first men and his dreams seem to have more to them. I think he has the power of greensight or at least some association with the old gods. Why else would he see these things? 

Also he seems important to Bran and Bloodraven.

&gt;And suddenly there came a wild thumping, as the maester's ravens hopped and flapped
inside their cages, their black feathers flying as they beat against the bars with loud and raucou caws. ""The tree,"" one squawked, ""the tree, the tree,"" whilst the **second screamed only, ""Theon,

She rebuffs him because of what Tywin's reaction would be - you know the drill.

1349751002.0,228,self.asoiaf,116cbh,(Spoilers All) Why was Tywin furious when Tyrion...,Arthur_Dayne,261,33,187,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/116cbh/spoilers_all_why_was_tywin_furious_when_tyrion/,"Why was Tywin furious that Tyrion demanded a trial by combat in the matter of murdering Joffrey?

&gt; “This is folly, Tyrion,” declared Lord Tywin. “Speak to the matter at hand. You are not on trial 
for being a dwarf.” 

&gt; “That is where you err, my lord. I have been on trial for being a dwarf my entire life.” 

&gt; “Have you nothing to say in your defense?” 

&gt; “Nothing but this: I did not do it. Yet now I wish I had.” He turned to face the hall, that sea of pale faces. “I wish I had enough poison for you all. You make me sorry that I am not the monster 
you would have me be, yet there it is. I am innocent, but I will get no justice here. You leave me no choice but to appeal to the gods. I demand trial by battle.” 

&gt; **“Have you taken leave of your wits?” his father said.**

&gt; “No, I’ve found them. I demand trial by battle!” 

&gt; His sweet sister could not have been more pleased. “He has that right, my lords,” she reminded the judges. “Let the gods judge. Ser Gregor Clegane will stand for Joffrey. He returned to the city the night before last, to put his sword at my service.” 

&gt; **Lord Tywin’s face was so dark that for half a heartbeat Tyrion wondered if he’d drunk some poisoned wine as well. He slammed his fist down on the table, too angry to speak.** It was Mace Tyrell who turned to Tyrion and asked the question. “Do you have a champion to defend your innocence?” 

&gt; “He does, my lord.” Prince Oberyn of Dorne rose to his feet. “The dwarf has quite convinced me.”

Later, Tyrion hypothesizes that his father was angry about the damage he'd caused the Tyrell-Dorne alliance:

&gt; No matter what happened, Tyrion had the satisfaction of knowing that he’d kicked Lord Tywin’s plans to splinters. If Prince Oberyn won, it would further inflame Highgarden against the Dornish; Mace Tyrell would see the man who crippled his son helping the dwarf who almost 
poisoned his daughter to escape his rightful punishment. And if the Mountain triumphed, Doran  Martell might well demand to know why his brother had been served with death instead of the justice Tyrion had promised him. Dorne might crown Myrcella after all.

But note the chronology: Tywin is furious at Tyrion's demand *before* Oberyn Martell shocks them by agreeing to champion Tyrion.  Tyrion also hypothesizes that Tywin thought he would ""go meekly"":

&gt;  Did you think I would go meekly, Father?

But again, none of this explains why Tywin would be so furious at the request for a trial by combat.

There are two possibilities:

1.  Tywin wanted Tyrion to take the black.  This seems plausible, since Kevan repeatedly urges Tyrion to take the black.  However, Tywin asks Tyrion to offer a defense - not a confession.  When Tyrion asks for a trial by combat, Tywin does not urge him to confess - he asks him if he's gone crazy.

2.  Tywin was planning to have Tyrion acquitted somehow, and Tyrion's demand for a trial by combat prevented him from acquitting his son.  This seems implausible at first, but what other reason does Tywin have to be so angry and surprised at Tyrion for demanding a trial by combat?  Tywin is no fool, so he'd surely realize that a trial by combat would be the obvious fallback for a man with no other options - a man who was facing a jury sure to convict him.  Is it possible that Tywin was planning to somehow convince Tyrell to vote against convicting Tyrion (only convincing Oberyn would have sewn emnity between Dorne and Martell).  If Oberyn and Martell had both voted innocent, Tyrion would have gotten off and no one could say it was just Tywin favoring his son.

The other evidence in favor of this theory is that Tyrion's trial follows Tywin essentially 'disowning' Jaime.  Tywin NEEDS an heir to Casterly Rock.  Could it be that he was coming around to the idea of Tyrion inheriting the Rock after all?  I doubt he'd want to leave it to Lancel or another relative - he definitely respects Tyrion's intelligence and cunning.

&gt; ""The history of any country, presented as the history of a family, conceals fierce conflicts of interest (sometimes exploding, most often repressed) between conquerors and conquered, masters and slaves, capitalists and workers, dominators and dominated in race and sex."" - Howard Zinn, [A People's History of the United States](http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinncol1.html)

One of the more enjoyable (if not the most enjoyable for me) aspect of ASOIAF is the in-book history of the realm. It's a testament to GRRM's love of real-world history that the history of Westeros is so fascinating to the reader. But there are problems with what's presented. The history of Westeros, as we know it, is the history of the nobility. We generally get the perspective of what the nobility thinks and feels about past and present events of Westeros. What's lacking is the perspective of the Smallfolk. Do they care that Rhaegar fought valiantly, nobly and died on the Trident? Do they have strong opinions on whether Robert was right to rebel against the Targaryens? How did they view Aegon's original conquest? How will the Smallfolk remember the events of the Seven Books?

The Areo Hotah Problem
-

&gt; Areo Hotah did not know what to say to that. He was only a captain of guards, and still a stranger to this land and its seven-faced god, even after all these years. Serve. Obey. Protect. - *AFFC, Chapter 2, The Captain of Guards*

Though a foreigner to Westeros, **Areo Hotah best represents the noble idealization of the Smallfolk.** Namely, they are to be silent, servile, obedient and answer the lord's call militarily when needed. The major complaint about Areo as a POV is that he is mostly there to observe the events of House Martell, and yet I wonder whether Areo might serve (probably unintentional) purpose of showing the nobility's concept of how regular folks should act. The history of Westeros, as told by the nobility, is one of dynastic power struggle and war between great houses and great lords. The Smallfolk endured and served the great lords often at a much greater expense than the lords they served.

Broken Men: the People's Perspective of History
-

&gt; ""They have little to touch, my lady. Their treasures are shells and stones and leather boats, their finest weapons knives of rusted iron. They are born, they live, they love, they die. They know Lord Mooton rules their lands, but few have ever seen him, and Riverrun and King's Landing are only names to them."" - *AFFC, Chapter 25, Brienne V*

Though the historical perspective is limited, it is not fully absent from the story. The best example of this comes through Septon Meribald and his Broken Man Monologue. It's been [commented on](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/41024-meribalds-speech-is-the-heart-of-feast/) at length previously. For purposes of this post, it best represents the people's perspective on the historical event known as [The War of the Ninepenny Kings](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/War_of_the_Ninepenny_Kings).

Through Meribald's perspective, we understand why the common people of Westeros fought in the war. 

&gt; ""They've heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know.""

To the Smallfolk of Westeros, their perspective initially seems to be one of advancing their station in life. To the Smallfolk, the War of the Ninepenny Kings meant getting out of the short, nasty brutish lives that they endured previously. Through war, they lose their identity as Smallfolk and begin to commit the various crimes and brutalities that they endured previously.

&gt; ""If they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands they're fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there it's just a short step to carrying off their daughters too.""

During the war, the common people who fought in it became as bad as the nobles who routinely stole from them, but when they broke, they had no hold to return to, no family name to rely on for protection, and God forbid they were captured. Tyrion makes this comment on the War of the Five Kings:

&gt; ""That was the way of war. The smallfolk were slaughtered, while the highborn were held for ransom."" - *A Clash of Kings, Chapter 20, Tyrion V*

And in the end, did Meribald gain anything through the war? What was final perspective on his involvement in the war?

&gt; ""The War of the Ninepenny Kings?"" asked Hyle Hunt.

&gt; ""So they called it, though I never saw a king, nor earned a penny. It was a war, though. That it was.""

Conclusion
-

There is no possible way to craft a full or really a good incomplete history of Westeros as seen through the people's perspective. I hope that [The World of Ice and Fire](http://www.amazon.com/The-World-Ice-Fire-Official/dp/0553805444) may contain something of a people's perspective on past events, but I think that it will be more of the same history of the nobility that we admittedly love. And this isn't limited to a fantasy series either. Medieval History, as know it today, is the history of the nobility. The peasant classes of Europe in the Middle Ages didn't have time to write down their thoughts of events as they happened. They were too busy surviving than to learn to read and write. The same goes for the people of Westeros.

*The Tickler backed away. Arya could smell his fear. The shortsword in his hand suddenly seemed almost a toy against the long blade the Hound was holding, and he wasn’t armored either. He moved swiftly, light on his feet, never taking his eyes off Sandor Clegane. It was the easiest thing in the world for Arya to step up behind him and stab him.

“Is there gold hidden in the village?” she shouted as she drove the blade up through his back. “Is there silver? Gems?” She stabbed twice more. “Is there food? Where is Lord Beric?” She was on top of him by then, still stabbing. “Where did he go? How many men were with him? How many knights? How many bowmen? How many, how many, how many, how many, how many, how many? is there gold in the village?”

Her hands were red and sticky when Sandor dragged her off him. “Enough,” was all he said.*

It occurred to me that Rugen was probably one of Varys's disguises, and that brought up a couple questions, which I will get to in a minute. First, some evidence that Rugen is actually Varys:

* In AGOT, Varys visits Ned Stark in the black cells disguised as a gaoler. GRRM describes him as short, stout, with plump cheeks ""covered with a dark stubble of beard"" and ""reeking of sweat and sour wine""
* In AFFC, Qyburn describes Rugen as ""portly, unshaven, gruff of speech"" to Cersei. The chief undergoaler, Rennifer Longwaters, gives a similar description to Jaime, consistent with that of Varys in AGOT.
* Both Qyburn and Longwaters note that Rugen held his appointment of the old king, Aerys. This is consistent with the time period that Varys is known to have been in Kings Landing. 
* Qyburn says that Rugen came and went as he pleased, while Longwaters says that he was seldom at his post, except when there were actual prisoners in the Black Cells, such as Ned Stark, Pycelle and Tyrion. That would make sense if Rugen was just an alias, as Varys could hardly spend all his time pretending to be a gaoler.

So, all of that is probably not a surprise to hardcore readers. What I'm really interested in is what the possible implications of this could be. 

1. Qyburn discovers a gold coin, minted in Highgarden in the days before the conquest, hidden in Rugen's cells. Why would Varys have Tyrell gold? My best explanation is that Varys probably planted it there to sow suspicion between the Lannisters and the Tyrells, which is exactly what happens. Seems pretty straightforward. Though there's always the slim chance that the Varys is somehow involved in the [Tyrell Conspiracy](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/8204-grand-tyrell-conspiracy-theory/), but I doubt it. 

2. Jaqen H'ghar. The chief undergaoler (and GRRM, by extension) makes a point of bringing up the three men that were being kept in the Black Cells before Lord Stark was arrested as a traitor, and that they were given to Yoren for the Wall under Rugen's watch. We still have no indication of how Jaqen got into that cell in the first place. Got me to wondering whether Varys and Illyrio are responsible for Jaqen's mission in Westeros, to somehow aid in their plot of putting a Targaryen back on the throne. The two of them would certainly have the resources to pay for a Faceless Man. Then again, sending your assassin to the Wall in chains seems like a bad strategy, unless that's where his target was... And, of course, it could just be a complete coincidence and I might be reading way too deep into this.

1357144046.0,227,self.asoiaf,15txnx,(Spoilers ALL) Theory concerning Robert Arryn's illness and Littlefinger.,GiuseppeZangara,287,60,211,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/15txnx/spoilers_all_theory_concerning_robert_arryns/,"I was re-reading AFFC and I came upon a few passages that caught my attention. In Sansa's second chapter, she aids Robert Arryn down the mountain and Littlefinger divulges a large chunk of his master plan. A couple of things that are said in it give me cause to think that with the help of Maester Colemon, Littlefinger is either the direct cause of Robert Arryn's shaking illness or that he is purposefully exacerbating it.

While Sansa is attempting to coax Robert into willingly leave the Eyrie, he mentions that:

&gt; Maester Colemon put something vile in my milk last night, I could taste it.

When Sansa mentions this to Coleman he says:

&gt; ""Vile?"" Colemon blinked at her, and the apple in his throat moved up and down. ""I merely...is he bleeding from the nose?

He is obviously uncomfortable and seemingly hurries to changed the subject. Sansa doesn't seem to notice anything and doesn't bring it up again. He brings up the bloody nose later on:

&gt; you're *certain* he was not bleeding from the nose.

After their treck down the mountain Sansa arrives at the Gate of the Moon and finds that Littlefinger has returned from his trip. There, he tells Sansa of her betrothal to Harry the Heir and a part of his grand plan. Through a good deal of explanation Sansa realizes how Harry the Heir received his nickname, and that he is in fact Robert's Heir and if Robert were to die, he would inherit the Eyrie and the Vale. To which Littlefinger says:
&gt; *When* Robert dies. Our poor brave Sweetrobin is such a sickly boy, it is only a matter of time. *When* Robert dies, Harry the Heir becomes Lord Harrold, Defender of the Vale and Lord of the Eyrie.

So we know the following: that Littlefinger expects Robert to die, that Colemon has been Robert's primary caregiver for some time (possibly since his birth, we don't know when he entered Jon's service, just that he was his personal Maester by his death), and that Colemon was evasive about what he gave Robert.

My theory is that Colemon is in Littlefinger's pocket and has been for some time. And that he has slowly been poisoning Robert and causing his illness for some time.

1341377454.0,229,self.asoiaf,w0mrp,(Spoiler TWOW) Some notes (and 2 brief chapter recaps) from GRRM's reading in Seattle tonight,yeswithanh,260,31,220,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/w0mrp/spoiler_twow_some_notes_and_2_brief_chapter/,"Thanks everyone for [suggesting such great questions earlier today](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/vzpno/im_seeing_grrm_speak_in_seattle_tonight_what/). I didn't end up asking anything because, seriously, the first 10 people who went asked such great questions. Also, I got shy. But as a thank you to this amazing community, I took pretty extensive notes and figured I'd share them. Nothing earth-shattering, but a lot of fun stuff and a few promising nuggets.

**Reading:**

He read two chapters from TWoW. One was the full version of the Victarion chapter that's been going around (I'm not sure where it is online - I downloaded a PDF someone posted here). The other was a Tyrion chapter. Both were set-up chapters for the battle of Mereen, which is shaping up to make Blackwater look like a schoolyard scuffle.

**Victarion:** this chapter takes place on a ship. Victarion calls three thralls to his cabin and orders them to blow the dragon horn. Each will blow it once, hopefully avoiding the fate of the man who blew it three times at the kingsmoot and then died. Then the dusky woman bleeds his hand and there was some sex that was pretty awkward to hear GRRM read. Finally, he gets dressed up in some intense armor, goes to the deck, the war drums start beating and they prepare to attack. It was a pretty badass ending.

**Tyrion:** This scene takes place in Brown Ben Plumm's tent. He and Tyrion are playing cevasse. This chapter seemed to have 3 major plot points:

- Setting the stage for what's going on in Mereen, all the various factions, etc. Most of this is a recap from the end of DwD. One interesting thing is that several of the Yunka'i have split the three remaining hostages amongst them and Tyrion seems to be trying to figure out a way to capture Daario. Oh also: the Yunka'i are loading trebuchets with pale mare corpses and lobbing them into Mereen.

- Tyrion begins trying to persuade Brown Ben to go turn cloak again and go back to Dany, which Ben seems amenable to.

- Jorah shows up at the end and tells them that there are ships in the bay with black sails and kraken sigils and everyone goes ""what the fuuuuuck?""

**Fun tidbits from the Q&amp;A, in no particular order:**

- Morrocco will be the location for the Slaver's Bay cities next season.

- Apparently, he wrote 3 characters that are meant to be the 3 Stooges into the first book! But he wouldn't say who they were, just that they'd died. I'm not entirely sure he wasn't fucking with us. Any ideas?

- Victarion is ""dumb as a stump."" I think this tells us everything we need to know about his eventual fate (my thoughts, not GRRM's words).

- He was asked a bunch of questions about his writing process. He told us that he does, indeed, know where the plot will end up, but not how it will get there. He said it would be like if he drove from Seattle to NYC - he'd know the destination and the general route, but not everything that was going to happen along the way. He also said that his characters were ""treacherous"" and sometimes forced him to change his plans. :)

- One of my favorite questions was about Howland Reed. A woman asked if his children might know anything about what happened at the Tower of Joy. He scoffed a little and said he couldn't tell us that, but then admitted **""yes, the Reeds *may* know some things.""**

- He assured us that we will learn about Jon's parentage: ""all will be revealed.""

- Someone asked if he reads fan theories and he said no, because it would be too tempting to change things if people got things right that he wanted to be a surprise, which would mess everything up, so he just stays away.

Whew, that's all I can remember/have in my notes for now. Again, nothing earth-shattering, but still, interesting stuff.

EDIT: a few points others made, and something fun I forgot: 

- Samer791 made [a separate post](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/w0ply/football_reference_the_life_of_the_triarch/) about the Bill Belichik connection.

- It may have been both krakens and dragons on the sails of Victarion's fleet.

- I thought this was funny. Someone asked a question about Renly and Loras' relationship. GRRM said that he gets lots of emails asking him for some explicit sex scenes between men in future books. He deadpanned: ""these always come from female fans.""

but how much actual sex is there in the books? from the top of my head i can remember only like 6 or 7 sex scenes in +4200 pages.

is that fact that a novel does not completly ignores the topic of sex (like most literature) make it seems loaded with sex? this may be me just not being from the USA but i did not think that the books where all about senselessness sex.

&gt;“I can describe an axe entering a human skull in great explicit detail and no one will blink twice at it. I provide a similar description, just as detailed, of a penis entering a vagina, and I get letters about it and people swearing off. To my mind this is kind of frustrating, it’s madness.

1358871848.0,224,self.asoiaf,17273w,[Spoilers All] Irony in death,Pihlbaoge,277,53,233,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/17273w/spoilers_all_irony_in_death/,"As many have probably already noted, it is hard predicting the outcome of the story in advance. Things get turned over quite often, some characters die, and others emerges to win our hearts.

One thing I have noticed though is the irony. The irony of all deaths. 

When people die, they die in a very ironic way, in reference to how they lived or behaved as a person. 

To make somewhat of a list.

**Lysa Arryn/Baelish/Tully** Killed by her lover, murder framed on someone else. Like hwne she killed Jon Arryn.

**Tywin Lannister** Proud lord Tywin died with a whore in his bed while taking a dump. His corpse smelled bad and the never smiling lord's corpse had a stupid grin on his face.

**Ned Stark** The honorable Lord Stark was forced to admit to a crime and dishonor he never committed and still lost his head when Joffrey didn't keep his promise of Mercy. 

**Robb Stark** The honorable Robb, his fathers son, who Married for honor, who beheaded one of his most loyal bannermen for honor, who never lost a battle, in the end lost his head and kingdom when two of his bannermen who dishonored themselves by breaking the most sacred of wows. 

**Quentynn Martell** Goes around the world to take his place besides the Dragon Queen, becoming the Dragon King. Keeps telling himself and his friends that he does have the blood of the dragon in him. Killed by a dragon, realizing that he is in fact not a dragon only when it is too late. 

**Khal Drogo** The most fierce warrior in the world, who has 100 000 Dothraki screamers under his command, who's hair had never been cut, fell from his horse and was in the end suffocated by a woman. 

**Joffrey** The proud king, who didn't discus battle plans with women, who was going to bring Sansa the head of her Brother. Who was going to give Stannis a ""red smile"". In the end he choked on his own pie, his final words calling for his mommy. 

**Catelyn** (Disregard the Lady Stoneheart part, as she did in fact first die, and honestly, there doesn't seem to be much of Catelyn left in Stoneheart) Refused to go to the Twins to look at brides for Robb, refused to go back to Winterfell because Robb needed her more than Bran and Rickon. Died at the Twins when Robb married another woman. Died believing that Bran and Rickon were dead. Died believing that all her children but Sansa were dead. Died unaware of that the only child to die was Robb, whom she was there to look after.



**With this in mind, I find it very funny to speculate in how others will die. As there has to be irony in it.**

**Carsei** Runs around all her life trying to protect her children and herself from Tyrion, never realizing that the Brother who was about to kill her was her lover Jaime. 

**Walder Frey** Tries to build a dynasty. Betrays Robb Stark to get a better postion. Sees his house crumble before him, and finally dies as the last Frey. 

**Ramsay Snow/Bolton** After spending his entire life trying to was away the Title ""Bastard of Bolton"" he is finally killed by the Bastard of Stark, Jon Snow. Or getting killed by his dogs that seem to prefer Theon to him now. 


**EDIT. As there has been some confusions to this, my last three characters are speculations for the future. Some people seem to have missed that part. Also, expanding the list a bit**

**Robert Baratheon** Killed by his vices. Women, Alcohol and Hunting. 

**Viserys Targaryen** Khal Drogon gave him his golden crown as he was promised.

If Brown Ben's dragonblood is from the reign of Aegon V or Aegon IV and twice as strong as Quentyn's, he could be a dragonseed and quite useful to Dany down the road.

His brothers held a kingsmoot, but instead of them being chosen, Urragon Goodbrother was chosen and then killed Torgon's brothers. Torgon later returned, announced that the kingsmoot was unlawful since he was not there, and became King of the Iron Islands due to the Ironborn not like Urragon's rule. So why does Asha kiss Tris after he tells her this tale? Theon is Balon's last surviving son, so he should have been present at the kingsmoot. If Asha can somehow find Theon (which she later does) and bring him to the Iron Islands, she can have him call the kingsmoot unlawful and repeat what Torgon did. Yet there are a few things going against Theon becoming King which are:
*The Ironborn actually like Euron's rule so why would they choose Theon unless Euron somehow screws up.
*Theon isn't seen as an Ironborn, since he spent so much time with the Starks.
*Finally, he lost his manhood.
While these do go against him, there is a possible answer to the last problem. In ACOK, Theon beds the captain of the ship's daughter, and says that she might be pregnant with his bastard.

Tyrion dying. Can't imagine that.

The Wall falling somehow. It is a thing that for a moment worried us then it was discarded and if it was retaken suddenly, without warning I'll be F'd up.

RLJ being a lie. I think as some of you I am so convinced that this is true that I would'n believe it not to be.

This has been discussed on this subreddit, but many people seem to have misunderstood what he said. They believe he said Jon's situation was similar to Luke and Leia from Star Wars.

Here is the important part of the interview for the lazy people:

&gt; **What did you ask him about in return?**

&gt; You know, I asked him about who Jon Snow's real parents were, and he told me. I can't say who, but I can tell you that it involves a bit of a Luke Skywalker situation.

Just to clear something up: ***He didn't say it was a Luke and Leia situation***.

What he says is that Luke's situation is similar to Jon's. That probably means that Jon Snow believes his father is a different person than he actually is. Quite possibly, Eddard Stark wasn't his father.

* Does that mean R+L=J is confirmed? **No.**

* Did Alfie Allen say it was a Luke/Leia situation? **No.**

* Does Jon have a sister or brother? **It's possible but the interview doesn't contain information on that question**.

* Is Daario = Benjen? Is Varys a Merling? **Possibly**.

I have just watched episode 9 and was wondering if Robb did warg into his wolf because after Greywind died Robb was still alive inside the castle.

I think however that when Robb was unconscious he warged into his wolf, was then murdered again in his wolfskin, and then went back to his own body when he stood up in the hall. This would mean Robb saw Arya just before he died in Greywind's skin. It would also explain the order of scenes as in: Robb gets shot and is unconscious in the hall; Greywind gets really pissed and tries to escape form his cage but ultimately dies again; Robb stands back up in the hall.

Further evidence of this is that when Jon killed Orell he went into his eagle and attacked him again, I think this hints that Robb went into Greywind to try and attack the Freys and maybe burst into the castle and try save them.

Any thoughts?

Edit: Sorry I get confused with all the different characters I meant Orell not Varamyr

Also I would like to add I am not trying to read into this too far or anything I was merely stating that that's what I think happened on the TV show and I think it makes it all a lot more emotional and sad.

A lot of people have said that because we didn't see Robb do the white eye thing for warging is proof he didn't warg but when Robb was collapsing and on the floor in the hall we didn't see his face. I still maintain that because of the order of scenes and the behaviour of GW and Robb's actions that he warged into GW as he was being attacked.

That being said I DO NOT think Robb said 'Mother' to warn her about Arya, I think he knew they were screwed and he said it just to say goodbye. Realistically what could he have done? Shout 'Mother Arya is outside' and have every fucking Frey go after her? Also there was no urgency in Robb's speach. But this does not mean he didn't see Arya through GW.

I think the creators of the show put this in to make it more sad and emotional for us book readers (and possibly show readers if they could pick up on it which is doubtful) and when I was watching it I immediately thought it was Robb in GW. Maybe next season or next episode even we will have Arya saying something like 'I saw the Freys butchering Robb' which would hint that it was Robb in GW?",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1370384870.0,,,True,t3_1fnk1u,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fnk1u/spoilers_asos_did_robb_warg_into_greywind/,

The Mountain murdered, raped, looted and tortured his way around the Riverlands, probably murdered his sister and father, burned half of his brother's face off, raped and murdered Princess Elia with the brains of her child on his hands and probably a million other horrible things along with his merry crew of psychopaths.

Qyburn... His experiments... Let's just call him a Mengele expy and a sick fuck and leave it at that. 

Cersei has sex with her brother, has her husband's bastards murdered, emotionally abuses her youngest son, turns over innocent people and friends over to Qyburn for torture, abuses Sansa and through her sheer incompetence turns the realm into a giant clusterfuck.

Tywin (Jesus, the Lannisters are fucking awful people) started the whole fucking war by invading the Riverlands in response to Cat abducting Tyrion and later tries to get Tyrion killed in battle. He had half of his household guard rape a 13 year old girl and forced his son to rape her too, telling him that she was a whore when in reality she actually did love him. He orchestrated the Red Wedding, sacked King's Landing, protected monsters like Amory Lorch and Gregor Clegane so he could unleash them on innocent people... 

Walder Frey turned on Robb due to the insult to his honor and broke the most ancient law of Westeros in the Red Wedding, causing the deaths of who knows how may people. Also, his creepy-ass family doesn't speak well of his parenting skills, only his ability to keep churning out kids. 

Craster rapes his daughters to breed more wives for himself and gives the boys as human sacrifices to the Others. 

Pretty much any of the Masters of Mereen, Astapor or Yunkai. Just read the part about the training of the Unsullied or how the slavers crucified child slaves (163 of them) pointing the way to Mereen. 

Last, and certainly not least, Ramsay Bolton. You learn ALL about him in ADWD, and I'm guessing that more than a few readers were extremely disturbed by him. Listing all of the awful things that he's done would be too time consuming, so please, feel free to reference them in your arguments. 

Edit: After reading through some of the comments, I definitely agree that King Aerys deserves a spot on the list. His horrendous executions of pretty much anyone who crossed him, as well as his brutal rape of his sister-wife easily make him one of the most awful people on the list.

Rorge is certainly awful and evil, but compared to so many others on the list, he's a puppy. His dog-fighting ring, his treatment/raising of Biter, his numerous rapes and murders certainly put him on the list, which leads to...

Ser Amory Lorch is probably best known in Westeros for his brutal murder of the Princess Rhaenys, who was four years old at the time. When trying to capture Beric Dondarion, he crossed into Hollywood villain territory. He grabbed a husband and wife and threatened to hang them unless Dondarion turned himself in. Dondarion turned himself in of course, and Lorch hanged the couple with him. 

The best that can be said of the Mountain's men is that they aren't as vile as the Brave Companions. When you consider just how awful many of the Mountain's men are, that's saying something.
http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_Mountain%27s_men

The Brave Companions and their leader Vargo Hoat are quite possibly one of the few organized groups that could be said to be on par in sheer viciousness as the Masters of Slavers Bay, IMO, and look, Qyburn was one of them!
http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brave_Companions

Euron Greyjoy...hell, most of the Greyjoy family except Asha and Theon (to an extent). They randomly murder a ton of people. Hell, read Victarion and Asha's POVs in ADWD. They have a royally screwed up ruling family on the Iron Islands. 

I can't believe that I left out Roose! Yes, Roose Bolton is certainly one of the most evil bastards walking on Westeros.

As well all know, the Lannisters trace their house back to Lann the Clever, who used his legendary wit to trick the Casterly's out of Casterly Rock all by himself.

Tyrion is presently outside Mereen, and as many have noticed, is in position to return to Westeros in league with Dany as her adviser/hand.  This will prove extremely important in the claiming of Casterly Rock.

I believe the tale of Lann the Clever is foreshadowing how Tyrion will reclaim Casterly Rock, which had previously been denied to him by Tywin.  This will show that Tyrion is the 'heir' of Lann the Clever and thus the truest Lannister.

Firstly Tyrion is extremely clever; his wit is legendary and may be on par of that of Lann the Clever.  Secondly, we know from his past that he used to be in charge of all pipes and cisterns in Casterly Rock.  Thirdly, we know from The Mystery Knight, that Whitewalls was breeched by a dwarf climbing up a privy shaft.

I believe Tyrion will use his wit, knowledge of Casterly Rock's plumbing and diminutive size, to sneak into Casterly Rock and claim it all by himself.

(Spoilers all),tembaarmswide,274,57,179,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/19z8c8/when_the_smoke_clears_spoilers_all/,"I have a mental exercise that has been bouncing around my head for a few weeks now. I was listening to an early episode of the podcast [Boars, Gore, and Swords](http://boarsgoreandswords.libsyn.com/) when friend-of-the-show Kelly Anneken mentioned a theory that she had during her early days of reading the books. 

Her theory was, that once the smoke cleared, there would be 7 characters left alive. Each of these 7 characters would represent the Seven gods of Westeros. I thought that bringing this idea here would provide for some interesting dialogue. 

The Seven of Westeros are as follows, for those of you who have made it through all the books without picking it up. (Copy and Paste from the wiki)

 &gt;**Father**, or the Father Above, representing judgment. He is depicted as a bearded man who carries scales, and is prayed to for justice.

&gt;**Mother**, or the Mother Above, representing motherhood and nurturing. She is prayed to for fertility or compassion, and is depicted as smiling with love, embodying the concept of mercy.

&gt;**Warrior**, representing strength in battle. He is prayed to for courage and victory. He carries a sword.

&gt;**Maiden**, representing innocence and chastity. She is usually prayed to to protect a maiden's virtue.

&gt;**Smith**, representing crafts and labor. He is usually prayed to when work needs to be done, for strength. He carries a hammer.

&gt;**Crone**, representing wisdom. She carries a lantern and is prayed to for guidance.

&gt;**Stranger**. An exception to the other aspects, the Stranger represents death and the unknown. Worshipers rarely seek favor from the Stranger, but outcasts sometimes associate themselves with this god. &gt;


Rules:

*The character must be alive at the end of aDwD (Jon Snow being the exception, as his fate is still unknown)

*The character has to be a major character 


*Hard mode: The character has to have a PoV chapter



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My lineup is as follows...

**The Father** - Jon Snow - This has been my pick since before I finished aDwD, though admittedly it's a little far fetched now. Thematically it makes sense. He's always talking about he doesn't want to be a father, it's one of the reasons he joins the NW in the first place. I can see him knocking someone up - Dany maybe - and he's a strong pick for surviving to the end, even with his current complications.

**The Mother** - Dany - this one is easy, Mother of Dragons.

**The Maiden** - Sansa - She's all about being a Lady, and she's still a virgin by the end of the fifth book. One a side note, Arya will probably still be a maiden by the end of the books, though I have my doubts about Sansa.

**The Warrior** - Jaimie -  I would really like Jamie Lannister here, but there are so many contenders, picking him would be tough. I could also see Brienne in this role.

**The Smith** - Tyrion - This is where it gets messy. Ideally, I would say Gendry, but he's not a PoV character. Rickon, who represents the Smith in the Stark family paradigm, is still alive (for all we know), but once again, not a PoV character. This would leave Tyrion as the obvious choice. He had the chain built, and he seems like he's about to forge some new alliances with Dany in the future. 

**The Crone** - Bran - Bran represents the Crone in the Stark family, and it doesn't look like he's going to die anytime soon. My guess is that he's going to in the story for one reason from here on out - exposition. He's going to light the way and answer some of those mysteries lost to time that we can only guess at. 

**The Stranger** - Arya - Who is she? Nobody. I don't think she's making it back to Westeros anytime soon, and when she does get back, no one will know who she is, and she's going to leave a trail of bodies behind her.

I find this statement so ridiculously simple that it really makes me mad.

It is true that there are a lot of influences of the War of the Roses: The Council, the Hand of the King, the Civil War, even the names of two of the main houses Lannister (Lancaster) and Stark (York). But there are so many other influences, especially of Britain’s history, but also of Europe’s history.

For a start, the population process of Westeros is parallel to that of the British Isles. Even the Children of the Forest, the first inhabitants of Westeros can be compared to the pre-Homo Sapiens hominid settlements in Europe.

The first humans to arrive to Westeros are the First Men, they use bronze weapons, and after fighting the Children of the Forest, they manage to settle an agreement with them, it is important to point out that they adopt the Children’s religion. The First Men can easily be identified with the Celts, a Bronze Age people originating in Central Europe which expanded through most Western Europe, including the British Isles. When the Celts arrived to Britain and Ireland they met pre-Celtic peoples which had been in the Isles for hundreds of years, among which the most known are the Picts. The Celts adopted the Drudistic religion of these pre-Celtic peoples just as the First Men adopted the Children’s religion. Both religions are similar, having strong views in the divine aspect of mother nature, especially trees.

The language of the First Men is just spoken by the wildlings North of the Wall, just like the Celtic languages are spoken by a few people in countries with a long and strong Celtic tradition (Wales, Scotland and Ireland). The First Men are fair skinned, dark haired and medium to light eyed. They worship the old gods, probably a Forest Children cultural influence, not a rare phenotype in the British Isles.

The Andals come with the second colonization wave. They are a tall, fair skinned, and light haired and eyed folk. They have iron weapons and easily defeat the First Men. It is easy to identify the Andals with the Germanic invasions Britain suffered after the fall of the Roman Empire. The phenotypical description matches with that of the Germanic peoples in Northern Europe, let’s remember that the Germanic tribes that invaded Britain, the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes, came from Jutland (Denmark), Northern Germany and Frisland. Even their name, Andals, could come after the Vandals, one of the Germanic tribes that invaded the Roman Empire.

The Andals worship the Seven, principal faith in Westeros. The Anglo-Saxons and the Jutes were pagan people who worshipped the Germanic Pantheon of gods. The Germanic invaders were stopped in Northern England by the Scots and the Picts, just like the Andals were stopped by the First Men in the North, that’s why the Northerners remain loyal to the Old Gods, just like the Scoti/Picti remained loyal to the Druidistic tradition and to the Celtic Gods. The Anglo-Saxons organized themselves in Seven Kingdoms just like Westeros is divided in the Seven Kingdoms.

The third and last colonization wave comes under the Warrior Queen Nymeria, the Rhoynar. It is difficult to identify these people with any historic people that settled in Britain. Due to their phenotypical description, they could be considered of Mediterranean appearance. So they could represent Roman or even Phoenician influence prior to the Germanic invasions.

The last of the invaders is Aegon Targaryen, of Valyrian stock, with a small Valyrian army (among which we can find other current Westerosi houses: Baratheons, Velaryons, etc.), and with the strong dragons, they come from Dragonstone, although their ancestral homeland is Valyria.  It doesn’t take a genious to identify Aegon with William the Conqueror, of Norman/Viking stock, who invaded England with a small Norman army, and not with dragons but with war boats with dragon heads, just like Viking Drakars. The Normans came from Normandy, just as close to England as Dragonstone from Westeros, but their ancestral homeland is Scandinavia.

Valyrians have their own traditions and language, and are the fairest of all the humans. Normans spoke their all language, Norman French, which remained as the King’s court language for hundreds of years, being of Scandinavian stock, they are as fair as one can be.

This is just a small example of how ASOIAF has so many other influences than the War of the Roses, we could identify the Wall with Hadrian’s Wall in Northern England to stop the wild Picts, Khal Drogo and the Dothraki with Attila and the Huns and the Medieval Bulgar (or even Mongol) Khans, the Free Cities with the Renaissance Italian city-states, and so many other things.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,RestoredBlackfyre,True,t3_141sls,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/141sls/spoilers_all_asoiaf_much_more_than_the_war_of_the/,
1343590111.0,217,self.asoiaf,xcpqj,(Spoilers ALL)  Ser Jaime has a dream in ASOS...,bass_voyeur,254,37,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/xcpqj/spoilers_all_ser_jaime_has_a_dream_in_asos/,"TL;DR  Ser Jaime's dream in ASOS was not a fever dream, but an old-god/weirwood dream.  Speculation it could be from Bloodraven or COTF.

This is long...

After leaving Harrenhal, the now maimed and feverish Ser Jaime is on his way to King's Landing.  He sleeps on a stump and has what is initially described as ""a bizarre fever dream"".  The sleeping area is described in ASOS, page 504:

&gt;A grove of trees... The moonlight glimmered pale upon the stump where Jaime had rested his head.  The moss covered it so thickly he had not noticed before, but now he saw that the wood was white.  It made him think of Winterfell and Ned Stark's heart tree.  *It was not him* he thought.  *It was never him*.  But the stump was dead and so was Stark and so were all the others... ""Do you believe in ghosts, Maester?"" he asked Qyburn.

The dream Jaime is one of the longest dream sequences in all of ASOIAF and touches on much of Jaime's current state of mind/personality including: guilt over his failed oath to Aerys and the Kingsguard, the loss of his hand and strength, Cersei controlling and abandoning him, the burden of Casterly Rock and his father, and Brienne.  Arguably, this dream and his decision afterward, is his turning point as a character.  He turns back to Harrenhal to save Brienne and symbolically begins turning his back to Casterly Rock and Cersei.

Given the above passage, I submit that Jaime slept on an old weirwood.  

1. The dead old tree is described as white and is in a grove which shares characteristics with the grove of weirwoods north of the Wall (AGOT, Jon Snow's oath), the weirwood in Winterfell (AGOT Ned), the weirwood in the Frostfangs (ACOK Jon), and 

2. Ned Stark is specifically referenced both in the dream and after the dream.  Further, the tree reminds him of the heart tree in Winterfell.  There is little doubt that the stump Jaime slept on was an old weirwood.

Given that we know that weirwoods are the source of power for greenseers from ADWD and the Bran/Bloodraven passages.  We know that greenseers have a pseudo-communication with the living via the dialogue from Bran to Jon Snow in ACOK (the passage where Bran encourages Jon to use his 3rd eye in the Frostfangs) and a passage from ADWD where Theon feels the presence of Bran from the weirwood in Winterfell.

I speculate that the dream Jaime has is no fever dream, it is a dream gifted by the weirwood.  My evidence is that: 

1. Jaime thinks and dreams of Ned Stark, a strange thought given that Jaime had small, though noteworthy interactions with Ned throughout his life.  However, I think that Ned represents both the North and the old gods to Jaime; if he had a dream from the old gods, this may be a deliberate connection.  

2. He also asks Qyburn what might be an embarrassing question regarding the existence of ghosts.  Remember that Jaime up until recently has been so full of pride that he withholds most comments about his true thoughts from Catelyn, Brienne and Roose.  *Why would he question Qyburn about ghosts?*  I think it is because Jaime felt a deeper connection from his dream and is profoundly disturbed from this dream.  It shakes him so much that he does a literal turnaround from his intended destination, delays meeting Cersei and his father and saves Brienne.  Truly a life-changing dream.  

3.  In our ASOIAF passages, many other characters have had deep changes to their personality from encounters with either greendreams and/or weirwoods including: Ned, Bran, Theon, and Jon with Sansa and Sam also having connections with weirwoods.

I think that with Jaime having slept on a weirwood, having a deep profound dream, changing his decisions/personality from that dream, connecting that dream to Ned and the old gods, and with ADWD evidence that Bran and Bloodraven communicate through weirwoods, we have ***reasonable*** evidence to believe that Jaime had some old god dream.

Speculation:
If Jaime truly was given a dream from the weirwood, what does this imply?  Was it a deliberate dream from the old gods, the COTF or perhaps Bloodraven?

---

Tywin: The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position, regardless of his own selfish desires.

[Tyrion looks away with a smirk.]

Tywin: Does that *amuse* you?

Tyrion: No, it's a very good lesson, only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions.

Tywin: Easy for me, is it?

Tyrion: When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interests, but solely for the benefit of the family?

Tywin: The day that you were born!

[There is a pause, and Tywin looks like he reconsiders what he is about to say.]

Tywin: I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away.

---

What if that was a deflection of what Tywin was about to confess? What if, in fact, Tywin ordered a Caesarian section, knowing it would sacrifice Joanna, the only woman he ever loved, for their child, a stranger? What if Tywin is one of the few men we have met who chose duty over love when the choice was hard? What if Tyrion is a reminder to Tywin of that choice in the same way Jon is a reminder to Cat of Ned's indiscretion?

We are repeatedly confronted with the choice between family and honor; love and duty. For our favorite characters, it has usually been a clear choice: Ned lies for the safety of his daughters, Robb puts Jeyne's honor before his own since she might mother his child, Jon betrays his vows to protect Arya. (For Jon, we actually get to witness this choice in his final chapter, which I found particularly heartbreaking; I recently took a close look at this choice here: http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fyo4i/spoilers_all_the_death_of_duty_a_mosaic_of/)

But for Tywin Lannister, family *is* duty *is* honor. If he was confronted with the choice to order a Caesarian section, it would have pit all of them against love. And perhaps Tywin was that one man in ten thousand Aemon speaks of who can make the hard choice, and we are introduced to the man he has become decades later. All that Pycelle does seems rooted in his educated opinion that Tywin is such a man:

I started reading ASOIAF as soon as I finished season 1 on HBO, and after completing the 5th book a month ago, I'm now on my first re-read and starting ACOK. To this point, only one other person in my life has read all of the books, and that is a guy I work with. To be brutally honest, he isn't an intelligent person, and so the intricacies and behind-the-scenes plotting goes largely amiss to him. My best friends are currently trying to catch up on books 3, 4, and 5, but they simply don't read quick enough. I have all of these thoughts swirling in my head about the wonderful universe that GRRM has created, and at all times I feel like I'm trying to contain a firework with a lit fuse.

This sub-reddit is the only place I can go to read and comment about the things that are on my mind, and may very well be the only reason I haven't spoiled anything (I hope) for my 2 best friends who are desperately trying to catch up to me.

They've been rattling around in my head for a while now! This post draws heavily on both of those posts, so I figured I'd start off by giving credit to them. **edit: both of those posts are spoilers all**

From the second post, most of the ""good Freys"" are children of Bethany Rosby. I checked out the history of House Rosby, and it seems like they're a pretty weak house.  They're a sickly bunch, and with the exception of Bethany, most of them die young without children.  Gyles Rosby, the head of house Rosby, didn't have an heir.  They don't have much land or wealth from what I can see.  House Rosby is very weak politically and physically.

Looking at the previous wives (Royce, Swann, Crakehall, Blackwood, Whent- in order),  Walder's marriages get progressively worse and worse, so far as house name goes.  House Royce is a very old and powerful house, and Swann is also old and powerfu.  Marrying a woman from house Crakehall was a downgrade for ol' Walder; at this point, he already has five sons, so nobody's going to give him their choice daughters.  Still, Crakehalls are known for their robustness, and according to Walder, they're ""sluts"", so at least he gets a strong woman who's fun to have around.  His fourth wife was a Blackwood, a good match, but still doesn't live up to the first two.  His fifth, a Whent, comes from a house known for its infertility (and Sarya Whent bears him no children); it's clear that his wives are progressively getting worse and worse.  At this point, nobody wants to marry their daughters to an old man with dozens of heirs.

Anyway, Walder marries Bethany Rosby after all that.  He's married a woman from yet another house known for its frailty and infertility; Walder values having a large family with lots of heirs, so he's pretty ticked that he got saddled with another narrow-hipped waif of a woman, even if she is pretty.  She does give him a child every year, but the damage is done; Walder's delicate pride is hurt!  He feels that he's married beneath himself.  As a result, he resents the children of Bethany Rosby.  He allows Bethany to raise the children as she pleases, resulting in a bunch of kids that actually aren't half bad, as far as Freys go.

So what does Walder do with these misfit kids?  He gets rid of them.  He sends the sons away whenever possible, and he marries the one daughter to a Tully.  It's a nice bonus that Roslin is pretty enough to be good ""bait"" for Edmure, but that's not what Walder cares about.  He wants to get rid of her, because she looks just like her mother.  Roslin is a reminder to Walder that his wives just ain't what they used to be.

All his actions in ASOIAF seem to support this. However, his actions before the series, during Robert's rebellion, suggest otherwise.
From all accounts, Aerys the mad was in no way a suitable leader, ruling based on his whims, alienating allies, and just destabilising the realm as a whole. Yet, Varys continues to support him, warning him against a potential plot by his son, and advising against letting Tywin into the city.

Given Varys' intricate spy networks, he likely would've known of Tywin's plans, and of Aerys' plans to burn King's Landing to ashes. 
So with these 2 points, and the fact that Aerys had pretty much lost the war, why would Varys continue to support him if he does indeed serve the realm?

And this is where I put on my tinfoil.

It seems to me that at the very least the pact between the wildlings and the Watch would disintegrate. This may lead to the Others crossing the wall much sooner than expected and invading westeros. 

Assuming that they move quite fast, they could very well decimate what's left of Stannis' army. As they move further down westeros, they could possibly put an end to a lot of the subplots here.

Perhaps this is how GRRM plans on finishing the series in two more books? The invasion would perhaps prompt Dany to finally return to westeros with her dragons.

1342536018.0,219,self.asoiaf,wpb27,(Spoilers All) I have a confession asoiaf Reddit. I like Feast better than Dance.,Hibno,293,74,156,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/wpb27/spoilers_all_i_have_a_confession_asoiaf_reddit_i/,"Now that I've finished Dance a few weeks ago and have a little distance from the series, looking back I enjoyed AFFC better than ADWD. Here is why:

GRRM seems to have stacked all his A-list character in Dance. Jon, Tyrion, Dany. They are the movers and shakers, and Dance is about all these big plot movements. Where Dance seems to be more plot oriented, Feast feels more focused on character development and the relationships between characters. Some of the stories I found to be moving:

You have Brienne's futile quest driven by her relationships with Jaime and Catelyn, and her gradual shift from mistrust to friendship with Pod, Hyle, even ol' Dick Crabb.

Everything about Jaime. Coping with the loss of his hand, as well as the loss of his father and brother. He's trying hard to be an honorable man. And there is a whole shifting dynamic in his relationship with Cersei.

Speaking of Cersei, I find her whole demise interesting. She sort of reminds me of Stalin. Paranoid and merciless. I like seeing her compete with Margery, and for all her flaws I find her affection for her boy king Tommen touching.

And I can't forget Sam's desperate and heart breaking journey. I don't need to tell you how touching his scenes with Aemon are, and he also has a very sweet relationship with Gilly. Definitely one of the nicer relationships in the book. Plus it is very satisfying to see Sam grow into this leadership role with his misfit companions.

Overall, I just think the stories in Feast have more sensitivity. There are some emotionally strong stories in Dance. I felt pity for Theon, and I like the nostalgic tone of the Barristan chapters. But when I look back I feel like Feast overall has the more emotionally powerful stories. I mean, the big plot points keep me coming back, but when it is all said and done it's those deeper personal stories that stick with me.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,,True,t3_wpb27,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/wpb27/spoilers_all_i_have_a_confession_asoiaf_reddit_i/,

And I know the AV Club reviewer wrote the same. But when Arya named The Tickler last season, we knew this scene would be fundamentally different. And I personally feel it was a fantastic change.

The main difference here is what actually happened from a legal point of view (humor me). If Arya had been arrested for The Tickler's death, she could have claimed self defense. Yeah, sure...she was stabbing him in the back. But they were in a full-on fight at the Inn and her life was very much at risk. 

That, of course, was not the case in the scene last night. She committed murder. Like straight up, first degree, premeditated capital murder. She didn't have to jump off that horse and engage that dude. She was going to kill him for vengeance. And she did so in a very cold and calculating way, like a murderer.

The scene mirrors not The Tickler scene, but actually the one with the guard at Harrenhal. It goes down in the exact same way, with her openly approaching her target as an innocent and dropping the special coin. But in the case of the guard, there was a slight air of justification to it. She couldn't stay at Harrenhal, not with Vargo Hoat coming to take over. Her life was in danger there as well. The scene also mirrored the vengeance in The Tickler scene. But she was not raging last night in the same way.

The show has given Arya a much lower body count so far, but it made that kill last night more murdery than any other in books (up to this point). I think it's a great way of showing what Arya is becoming rather than taking the scenic route that GRRM took.

All it does is mark it so that mods' attention are drawn to it.

I think, however, there is some confusion and I hope to clear that up.

Several recent posts having to do with Season 3 have been marked with the spoiler tag (Spoilers ASOS) in their titles. There's nothing wrong with this.

**If a post is marked (Spoilers ASOS), the *entirety* of ASOS is fair game.** It doesn't matter if you're talking about season three of the show and the event from the book hasn't aired yet. If someone reports a comment talking about [Spoilers ASOS](/s ""the RW"") but it's within a (Spoilers ASOS) post, that comment isn't going to be removed. 

Of course, if there are comments about later books in (Spoilers ASOS) posts, those comments will be removed if they have uncovered spoilers. 

That all said, please don't stop reporting comments and/or posts when you think it's necessary. Better to be too cautious than let things slide. It just marks the comment or post for us to take a look at. It doesn't auto-ban the poster or anything of the sort.

I'll start with the passage:

&gt;Roose Bolton removed a ragged strip of leather from the pouch at his belt. “My son sent this with his letter.” Ser Wendel turned his fat face away. Robin Flint and Smalljon Umber exchanged a look, and the Greatjon snorted like a bull. “Is that . . . skin?” said Robb. “The skin from the little finger of Theon Greyjoy’s left hand. My son is cruel, I confess it. And yet . . . what is a little skin, against the lives of two young princes? You were their mother, my lady. May I offer you this . . . small token of revenge?” Part of Catelyn wanted to clutch the grisly trophy to her heart, but she made herself resist. “Put it away. Please.” “Flaying Theon will not bring my brothers back,” Robb said. “I want his head, not his skin.” “He is Balon Greyjoy’s only living son,” Lord Bolton said softly, as if they had forgotten, “and now rightful King of the Iron Islands. A captive king has great value as a hostage.”


And with that the mater is whisked away and quickly forgotten. At my first reading I barely cared, I sort of thought ""well good; fuck him"" and moved along with the story. 

This is a very standard trope in a lot of literature and other media. Some minor villain gets his comeuppance and we don't really see it happen, he falls down a pit, or gets left behind in a terrible place, or we hear about it second hand before moving on. So when Theon has been captured and is being flayed for his crimes. I didn't really think about it, or care. But think about it.

Even without what we now know this is beyond horrible. Ramsey's murderous, rapist bastard has captured Theon Greyjoy and is *flaying him alive*? and why? It's clearly not because he really cares that Theon killed a couple of boys he's never met, he's flaying him because he likes flaying people and he can get away with it. He's removing his skin layer by layer for fun and he now has complete control of Theon. What else is he going to do?

And Theon really isn't **that** bad a character, I mean he's certainly misguided but with good cause, he doesn't have a place in the world and he made a series of bad choices that just made things worse and worse, did he really need to be **flayed**?

But we don't think of any of this because who cares about some minor character being tortured a bit for murder? Then Reek comes a long and, oh, oh god. How horrid, poor poor Theon. But by this time you've long forgotten this passage until you come back to it. GRRM put this in not because it foreshadows what's coming (though it does). It's far less subtle then almost all of his foreshadowing in the books. I believe this passage exists for when you reread the book. So that you can examine your attitudes towards characters you don't really care about.

So often in literature and in life we ignore bad things happening to bad people without really considering it. Most people are not purely evil, just misguided, or stupid, or bad but with some good. When we think of WWII we don't consider that every Nazi shot was a man, a lot were just men who needed money, or were proud of their country. They didn't realize they were on the bad side, and thousands of them were shot, and bled to death in the muck, and who cares? Had to be done!

Not to be overly political but an example is Obama and his drone attacks, to which most of us don't really care much about. ""Well it's less harmful then going in, and we don't put troops in harms way"". And he's killing terrorists and yeah some civilians get it, but it's not like Obama gets off on it, he's doing what he thinks is right. Yet somewhere across the world some little kid got ripped in half by an explosion he had nothing to do with, he experienced that pain, actual true horrible pain.

I think this passage is to remind us of how we ignore the pain of those we deem unimportant. Anyways, thanks for reading.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,Bloodraven,True,t3_14iekt,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/14iekt/spoilers_all_an_interesting_passage_i_overlooked/,

We have this family, of two parents and five kids, four of whom are alive and going through their own individual apprenticeships, and I started wondering about the Seven.

**Father** - Ned: Check

**Mother** - Catelyn: Check

**Warrior** - Robb: Not much of a stretch; this is all we got from Robb before RW

**Maiden** - Sansa: She's always been The Maiden, and thus not growing into this one so much.  Unless you consider most of her leverage at this point comes down to her being a maiden heiress (most people believe her brothers to be dead) and she (of Littlefinger) will be using that to her (or his) advantage.  Not much of a reach here, either.

**Stranger** - Arya: Easy. Check.

**Crone** - Bran: The crone carries the lantern, and people pray to her for guidance.  Bran now inhabits the weirwoods with greensight (I know, mixing religions, but there are a lot of things that we don't know about the foundations of these religions), and people literally pray to them for guidance.  Also, his mentor guided him North through dreams; it stands to reason Bran would be able to do the same.

and, the clincher,

**Smith** - Rickon:  Because he's going to come back, rebuild Winterfell and basically do all the work of restoring the family as Lords/Kings of the North.  Maybe he'll reforge Ice.  That would really seal it.

It's kind of hard to pin Rickon down because we don't know how/if he'll come back, so this is really all just random guessing.  But as I went through, it was kind of shocking how line by line, they all seemed to fit.   Now if we could just get some back story on the origin of the Faith of the Seven mythos.  I don't have the books with me, but it would be interesting to read about the ""exposition"" of this religion in GoT.

Anything I'm missing?  I'm not sure it's going anywhere, or if it's intentional.  There aren't any prophecies about the Seven having magic rings and getting together for a ""POWERS COMBINED!"" kind of apocalypse or anything, but it's an interesting angle.

This theory is drawn from [this very interesting thread](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/59217-the-northmen-inside-and-outside-winterfell-conspiration/), along with a couple of things I noticed when rereading ADWD. Apologies for the length, but I believe in being thorough :)
 
1. Lord Manderly reveals to Davos that he is still loyal to the Starks and is planning on betraying the Boltons and Freys. I think it's unlikely that the Manderlys and Glovers (Robett is with Wyman) are wholly alone on this project to reinstate a Stark in Winterfell. (ADWD Davos IV).

    Interestingly, Manderly only seems interested in finding Rickon, but we know from Wex that Bran, the elder brother, is also alive. Seemingly, Manderly makes no plans to look for Bran. Or at least, he doesn't reveal any such plans to Davos. He also makes no mention of Jon Snow, who could easily confirm the identities of any Stark children, whether they have direwolves or not.

2. The northmen who are with Stannis demonstrate that they're still loyal to the Starks. They are really only with him in order to rescue Arya and to take Winterfell from the Boltons (ADWD, ""The King's Prize"")

3. Bran and company meet up with a Liddle (one of the northern mountain clans) while they're on their way north. It is likely that the man knew who Bran was--the direwolf accompanying them is a dead giveaway. The Liddle mentions how much better things used to be when there was a Stark in Winterfell (ASOS, Bran II). There are Liddles with Stannis.

4. Lady Barbrey Dustin's odd behavior at Winterfell (ADWD, ""The Turncloak""). First, she confides a great deal in Theon, who, besides being a stranger, is a known turncloak and Bolton lackey. It's possible she told him about her hatred of the Starks in order to allay Bolton suspicions about her loyalty. After all, her husband (William Dustin) had apparently been close enough to Ned that he was brought along to the Tower of Joy. Yes, she claims to despise Eddard because her husband died in his service, but that seems weirdly irrational. The risk of your husband dying in service to his liege lord is just part of the price of being the wife of a lesser lord.

     You could argue that Barbrey's just vindictive and crazy, but she tells the Freys at one point that ""the North remembers"". This suggests that she doesn't buy their story about what happened at the Red Wedding. Rather odd thing for a woman who hates the Starks to say, don't you think? She also reminds the Freys that the Flints, Cerwyns, Tallharts, Slates, Hornwoods, Umbers, and Ryswells also had relatives who were guests at the Red Wedding (ADWD ""A Ghost in Winterfell""). 

    If Lady Dustin is working with Manderly, then this statement suggests that the north knows very well that the Boltons betrayed Robb and aren't willing to forgive and forget. There are also some hints that they aren't fooled by 'Arya Stark' and know that the Boltons have zero claim to Winterfell.

    Second, Lady Dustin really, really, really wants to check out the Stark crypts, but her visit seems oddly pointless. She talks some more about how much she dislikes the Starks and notice that some swords are missing. But let's say Lady Dustin is working with Manderly. Lord Manderly has Wex, who saw Bran et al. talking to Maester Luwin in Winterfell's godswood (ACOK, last Bran chapter). They told Luwin that they'd been hiding in the Stark crypts. Maybe *that's* why Lady Dustin needed to go see the crypts in ADWD--she was assigned to find evidence that someone had been hiding down there. The missing swords corroborate Wex's story (and the Liddle man's too). Now they know for sure that Rickon and Bran were not killed by Theon.

5. Theon sees Whoresbane quietly talking to Harwood Stout--who is a bannerman to Lady Dustin--after Ramsay's wedding (ADWD ""The Turncloak""). Maybe this means nothing, though GRRM doesn't usually have characters notice such details if they're not important in some way. Perhaps this is evidence that Whoresbane, Lady Dustin, and Manderly are all conspiring together?

6. There's some weirdness going on with a couple of letters that the Boltons sent to Jon (ADWD, Jon VI) and Asha (ADWD, ""The Wayward Bride""). First, both letters are signed by Whoresbane Umber, who is a reluctant ally of the Boltons due to the Greatjon being captive at the Twins. He signs with a crudely drawn version of his house sigil, even though he once studied to be a maester at the Citadel. It would be implausible for him to be illiterate, but maybe this is just how Umbers sign their names. 

    But here's another bit of weirdness: the 'wedding announcement' Ramsay sent to Jon has the signature of *Lord* Dustin (ADWD, Jon VI). But Lord Dustin is dead and has been for many years. Presumably, Lady Dustin signed the letter, but why did she sign it like this? Is this just a typo? Or was it meant to be some sort of message to Jon? Perhaps Lady Dustin was counting on Jon knowing that that Lord Dustin is dead and to be suspicious of anything Ramsay says. If so, it's too bad he didn't notice--this might've made him more cautious about that final letter from Ramsay at the end of ADWD.

So what do you all think? Does the north remember? Is a sigil just a sigil? Or will *The Winds of Winter* reveal there's been a vast northern conspiracy in the works?",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,True,,,True,t3_ppt6y,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/ppt6y/spoilers_all_the_north_remembers/,
1371156815.0,209,self.asoiaf,1gakpm,[Spoilers All] Theon's (possible) new heir,Kralizecc,264,55,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1gakpm/spoilers_all_theons_possible_new_heir/,"I'll admit this is a bit unlikely/tinfoily, but I thought I'd post it anyway to see what the community thought.

In ACOK Theon arrives on the Iron Islands on a trading vessel called the Myraham. During this voyage he repeatedly sleeps with the captain's maiden daughter, even commenting that he likely got her pregnant. 

The Myraham is prevented from leaving the Iron Islands to keep Balon's new rebellion a secret. The Myraham escapes months(?) later during the confusion of Balon's death and Euron's return. I believe that the captain's daughter ran away (or was disowned by her father) to live on Pyke. If she was pregnant it is extremely likely that the child is Theon's.


&gt;He put an arm around the captain’s daughter. “Summon me when we make Lordsport,” he told her father. “We’ll be below, in my cabin.” He led the girl away aft, while her father watched them go in sullen silence.

&gt;The cabin was the captain’s, in truth, but it had been turned over to Theon’s use when they sailed from Seagard. The captain’s daughter had not been turned over to his use, but she had come to his bed willingly enough all the same. A cup of wine, a few whispers, and there she was. The girl was a shade plump for his taste, with skin as splotchy as oatmeal, but her breasts filled his hands nicely and **she had been a maiden the first time he took her**. That was surprising at her age, but Theon found it diverting. **He did not think the captain approved, and that was amusing as well, watching the man struggle to swallow his outrage while performing his courtesies to the high lord, the rich purse of gold he’d been promised never far from his thoughts.**

The captain is outraged at the disrespect and general douchyness of Theon, and he's probably pissed at his daughter too

&gt;“Take me with you, milord,” the captain’s daughter begged. “I don’t need to go to your castle. I can stay in some town, and be your salt wife.” She reached out to stroke his cheek.

&gt;Theon Greyjoy pushed her hand aside and climbed off the bunk. “My place is Pyke, and yours is on this ship.”

&gt;“I can’t stay here now.”

&gt;He laced up his breeches. “Why not?”

&gt;**“My father,” she told him. “Once you’re gone, he’ll punish me, milord. He’ll call me names and hit me.”**

&gt;Theon swept his cloak off its peg and over his shoulders. “Fathers are like that,” he admitted as he pinned the folds with a silver clasp. “Tell him he should be pleased. As many times as I’ve fucked you, you’re likely with child. It’s not every man who has the honor of raising a king’s bastard.” She looked at him stupidly, so he left her there.

If the captain was abusive before, he's going to be much worse now that Theon has been pissing him off non-stop for a month.

A few weeks later Theon walks past the ship with Asha
&gt;Theon quickened his stride as they neared the Myraham, rocking high and empty by the quay. Her captain had tried to sail a fortnight past, but Lord Balon would not permit it. None of the
merchantmen that called at Lordsport had been allowed to depart again; his father wanted no word of the hosting to reach the mainland before he was ready to strike.

&gt;“Milord,” a plaintive voice called down from the forecastle of the merchanter. The captain’s daughter leaned over the rail, gazing after him. **Her father had forbidden her to come ashore**, but whenever Theon came to Lordsport he spied her wandering forlornly about the deck. “Milord, a moment,” she called after him. “As it please milord...”

&gt;“Did she?” Esgred asked as Theon hurried her past the cog. “Please milord?”

At this point its several weeks since Theon began sleeping with her, enough time for her to miss her period. I believe she's trying to talk to Theon about it.

Also, she's been locked aboard the Myraham for several weeks, so its safe to say no one else has been sleeping with her. She was likely locked aboard for several months until the Myraham escaped. This is important because it conviniently proves any child she has must be Theons (if she was left on Pyke she would probably have to whore herself).

My last piece of evidence is that she was included in the show, even the bit about her probably being pregnant.

**TLDR: The chick Theon sexed on the boat is probably pregnant with his bastard and still on pyke, meaning his line wouldn't end with him if he happened to be chosen at a kingsmoot.**

Catelyn II



I always found Cat's POV to be the most consistently harrowing to read. Her cataclysmic griefs and worries are inescapable and on top of that she must function as a major strategist in a war. Robb is the only child she has access to but for him she must hide her fears and pain to advise him as a king while her husband and other children are dead or in the hands of enemies. Cat's priorities in order are the words of House Tully, *Family, Duty, Honour*, and for most of the time we know her the Stark family is scattered, leaving her to struggle with duty and honour alone. One of the biggest mindfucks of the series for me was fleetingly experiencing the united and content Stark family then realising the relentless extent to which Gurm splits the pack. Catelyn's chapters embody this shock and pain.

Furthermore, we’ve complained about how we’ve run out of good theories, and the rise of bad theories, to the point where that’s not fruitful anymore either. Instead of complaining about this more, I’ve decided to try and introduce a shift, suggestions for the themes of the series overall. I think identifying themes can be just as fun as, and even more important than, just as useful as theorizing about characters.

Without further ado, I present my theory to you fine people. In my opinion (please note the word opinion) that one of the main themes in ASOIAF is identity. As the book series is huge, this theme is similarly encompassing, dealing with many facets of identity, such as who a person really is, how that person views him or herself, whether you shape yourself or not, and more. Unfortunately, I’m a college student, and (Brace yourselves) finals are coming, so I can’t go as in depth as I’d like to with this, and instead will hit on some of the bigger points I’d like to make. I’m sure as a group we can fill in places I missed. Second of all, if I accidentally mistake a book quote for a TV show quote, I deeply apologize. I’ve spent a few days working on this, but I can only work on it very late at night, so I’m not functioning at my best.

First and foremost, I’d like to touch upon what Tyrion said Jon in the beginning of the first book. Tyrion said “Let me give you some advice bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you.” I find this quote extremely important to my theme, and so I rely on it heavily when casting judgments on any character. I’d like to review a few characters in terms of this quote. For the sake of making my argument, I’m going to try to pair up characters in ways that helps prove my point.

We’ll start, logically enough, with Tyrion himself. The speaker of this quote, it cannot be said that Tyrion does not know who he is. On the contrary, he has a very firm grasp of his skills, limitations, and how others view him. Of course, Tyrion makes mistakes, as everyone does. However, I do not think his lapses in judgment overpower his generally correct views. I do not believe that one instance of Tyrion being wrong defeats this theory.

Opposing Tyrion is Cersei, his elder sister. Physically beautiful, politically inept, exceedingly unfriendly and not particularly charming, Cersei is in many ways the opposite of Tyrion, as well as in how valid her views on herself are. In reference to her beliefs as to who she is, Cersei believes herself to be the female counterpart of Tywin Lannister, her father (or not, if you subscribe to certain theories). After her father’s funeral, someone (I’m sorry, but I can’t really look this scene up right now, so the quotes might be a little, and I’m hazy on the other speaker here) said that they would never see Tywin’s like again, and Cersei thought to herself something along the lines of “You’re looking at his like right now”. Of course, the reader knows this to be false, and that belief is further confirmed by none other than Jaime, who thought to himself ""His Sister liked to think of herself as Lord Tywin with teats, but she was wrong. Their father had been as relentless and implacable as a glacier, where Cersei was all wildfire, especially when thwarted...She does not lack for wits but she has no judgement, and no patience."" We can clearly see that Cersei has no conception of who she is, and as a result, she’s completely incompetent.

While Tyrion and Cersei are very interesting, they don’t require any great lengths of thought. The third Lannister (a Lannister for all intents and purposes, for those who think he’s a bastard, a theory which I do subscribe to) is rather different. Jaime’s notions of who he is are a little bit blurred, likely because he changes quite a bit as the story progresses. We get the sense that, for the greater part of his life, Jaime did not give any serious thought to who he was, or anything of the like. Instead, he let others make those decisions for him. Tywin said he was to become a knight, he became a knight. Cersei said (essentially) that he was to join the Kingsguard, and so he did. Jaime’s life is a long practice in obedience, and so he never forms any opinions of his identity. It’s hard to say when this changes, but I would say it’s largely due to Brienne, a statement I don’t think will be too controversial. I’m not going to talk about Brienne too much, but for a female knight who sticks to that path very devoutly, we all know that Brienne knows who she really is. This self-awareness probably makes Jaime question who he is a bit, and the result is evidence. Before this change, Jaime is not that great a guy, even though he had done good, and even great, things. After the change, though, he becomes quite honorable, and a much more likeable and effective character.

Another very important character coupling to look at is the two bastards, Jon and Ramsay, paying special attention to the latter. I don’t think we need to go too in depth with Jon, but he’s important to mention because of Ramsay. Jon follows Tyrion’s advice, and remembers who he is. As a result, Jon is an effective character, at least in the eyes of the reader. Ramsay, on the other hand, is a stark (Haha, see what I did there?) comparison to Jon Snow. Ramsay Snow/Bolton is probably among the most hated characters by readers. Most subreddits I’ve seen where readers are asked who they hate most, or who they want to see get their comeuppance, always have Ramsay numerous times. My analysis of Ramsay here relies on a couple of other great posts that I unfortunately cannot find again, but will probably be remembered by many readers of this subreddit.

I read an essay awhile back that tried to defend some of the actions of the more despicable characters in ASOIAF, and of course Ramsay was prominent on that list. The author in question made a small defense for Ramsay, saying that his one desire was to be a Bolton, not a Snow. The author went on to say that being a Bolton meant, at least in historical terms, flaying people. Ramsay’s brutal treatment of other’s, then, is just him trying to fit in his the family he feels he is a part of, though the society of Westeros disagrees.

A recent post here expounded on that idea, saying that Ramsay’s treatment of Theon was an extended experiment of sorts, in which Ramsay was trying to find if it was possible to truly change one’s identity. As he was a bastard of a lord and a common girl, Ramsay ranks higher than many on the social scale, but in all reality, he was still a bastard of a lord and a Miller’s wife, and therefore looked down upon by the rest of the Westerosi powerful. Theon, then, is the perfect person for Ramsay’s experiment. Heir to the Iron Islands, skilled in battle, rather handsome and excessively arrogant, Theon represents the traits many feel a lord should have, and the setbacks many lords do have. In Ramsay’s mind, he probably felt if he could successfully turn Theon Greyjoy into Reek and keep him alongside him, everyone that witnesses that will see and understand how Ramsay Snow could become Ramsay Bolton. In short, Ramsay’s treatment of Theon evolves from a need for himself to prove that he could be a true Bolton. Ramsay feels the need to shed his Bastard identity to be an effective leader, whereas Jon Snow does not. This is what sets Jon Snow apart from many characters of the book, and how characters like him and Tyrion are so effective at being in command. It’s the outcasts of the society that are aware of who they are, and they use that in order to effectively apply their talents.

I’ll give one final example of the opposite of that, and it’s another POV character. I’m talking, of course, about Daenerys Targaryen, a fan favorite of many. I loved Daenerys when I was first introduced to her, but as the books went on it got to the point where she gave me headaches. It was Quaithe who finally revealed (subtly, of course) why that was. It came at the end of the fifth book, when Dany is wandering in the Dothraki Sea. She heard Quaithe’s voice saying “Remember who you are, Daenerys. The dragons know. Do you?”

Suddenly, Daenerys’ time in Meereen makes a lot more sense, as does how she’s so incompetent when she used to be so effective. It’s because Dany is not, and never will be, the Queen of Meereen. I feel this might be George R.R. Martin’s way of telling us that just because you sit on a throne does not make you a leader of that land. In playing the Game of Thrones, this could be of extreme importance. As Dany was not the Queen of Meereen, she was unable to rule it effectively, and that’s why her character bumbled around so much. Previous to that, when she was with the Dothraki or in Quarth, she had a much more accurate view of who she was, and was therefore able to handle herself much more effectively.

I think I’ve spoken enough now, though there’s much more to touch on. I hope that on my next reread I can pay more attention to alternate names at the beginning of POV chapters and further my analysis of those. Honestly, I think each character should be held up to this lens, and if we ever succeed in that momentous effort as a subreddit, we may be able to predict the events of future books with greater accuracy, instead of reading about the latest unsupported theory, which will probably be that Howland Reed is secretly warging into every character, so he’s actually the only character we really ever know.

And I noticed this passage: ""Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were kingdoms of the First Men, who had taken these lands from the children of the forest. Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faced in the trees kept watch. **So cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in hopes that their magics could win back what armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions. For years he searched, until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it. And the others smelled the hot blood in him, and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds**--""

Old Nan is interrupted so we don't know the end of the story.

So I'm thinking that the last hero survived/was saved by the children and became Coldhands.

Has anyone mentioned this passage before? All I've heard are theories of Coldhands being Benjen. 

I would love some input! 

EDIT:  Thanks for the feedback guys! I really like the [Night's King theory](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?title=Night%27s_King) as well. It might make more sense that Coldhands is the Night's King and that this passage is just an allegory for Bran or Jon. 

I also read a little bit further into the chapter and Bran mentions the story again. I don't know how relevant it is but here it is (Bran just heard that Benjen never came back from beyond the Wall):
    ""He was afraid for a moment, until he remembered how the story ended. ""The children will help him,"" he blurted, ""the children of the forest!""
    Theon Greyjoy sniggered, and Maester Luwin said, ""Bran, the children of the forest have been dead and gone for thousands of years. All that is left of them are the faced in the trees.""

When [last we discussed this](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/vmz0z/meta_about_spoilers_all/), most people seemed to favor changing the subreddit's spoiler policy to make the sub entirely ""spoiled."" A few people raised some reasonable concerns about this. I'm going to quickly outline the major points in the discussion and then put forward what I think is a thoughtful compromise. **It would be great if we could hear something from a mod about this.**

**Major points:**

- Almost every single thread is already ""spoilers all."" It's redundant to have ""(Spoilers all)"" at the beginning of every thread and the giant box of spoiler rules above the new thread box is annoying.
- There is major ""spoiler creep"" into threads with lesser scope because everyone is used to posting in threads with spoilers for all books. If the subreddit remains unspoiled, people may not realize that this could happen and accidentally get spoiled.
- This subreddit has a more restrictive spoiler policy for thread titles than /r/gameofthrones, which is meant for show viewers (who are ""behind us"" by three books) in that they are allowed to post characters' names in titles and we are encouraged not to (which is a policy that *almost no one* here follows).
- Allowing blatant spoilers in thread titles would be a major problem for anyone who happens to accidentally visit the subreddit or is already subscribed without having finished the books.
- Some people may want to have a serious discussion of the first couple books without the memes and ""it is known"" nonsense in /r/gameofthrones before they finish the series.

**The proposal:**

- Make (Spoilers ADWD) the default for this subreddit, and make sure this information is very prominently displayed. Posts with this scope *do not need tags*
- Allow people to *restrict* the scope of their posts by adding tags like (Spoilers ACOK) to their threads.
- Posts relating to TWOW must be tagged as such.
- Remind people that they should try to come up with clever ways to convey information to those who have finished the books in their titles while keeping out major spoilers.

This system has the major benefit of making threads with restricted scope (which is already the major outlier) stand out, so people will actually notice them and act appropriately.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,,True,t3_w9tdi,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/w9tdi/reviving_the_discussion_about_spoiler_policy/,

Azor Azhai is reborn into Berric Dondarrion after he is slain by the mountain, with a little help from Thorros. This explains Dondarrions additional lives, flaming sword and other supernatural powers. 

As we know Dondarrion revives Cat stark with the last kiss and I pretty sure dies in the process. Azor Azhai is passed with this final kiss and is now in lady stoneheart. 

From here my speculation gets a little wilder. As we know from the last chapter of ADWD John Snow get stabbed a few times. I think that he will die and remain die for most if not all of TWOW. Missisandre,  who I think knows more about JS's future than she has let on thus far, will saved his body and freeze it in an ice cell in the wall. 

Lady Stoneheart mean while will be getting the truth out of people and judging them as she has did with Brienne. She's comes across the R+L=J truth (unsure which person will give this up, thoughts???) and heads to the wall to judge JS in his own right. She gets to the wall to find him dead but with her AA supernatural powers she judges him through ghost. This proves to her that she was wrong about him all along (as well as Ned). Stoneheart then judges herself less worthy than JS and revives him passing on AA and dying in the process.

Yes, it's absolutely impregnable, but at what cost? Martin describes the ordeal that lords and ladies must go through to come and go as almost more arduous than what the wildlings must do to scale the Wall. Sure the castle can never be stormed, but I feel like it leaves itself very vulnerable to a siege. A relatively small army could block the delivery of provisions and starve out the castle's residents.

Yes, the people of the Vale seem very loyal to House Arryn, but I can't help but think of Robert's hypothesis of a Dothraki invasion that he gives in the tv show:

&gt; They leave us in our castles they go town from town looting and burning, killing every man who can’t hide behind a stone, taking all our livestock, killing all our women and children. How long to the people of the Seven Kingdoms, stand behind their absentee king? Their cowardly king? Hiding behind high walls, when do we people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful king after all?

Finally, you've got the fact that the castle is COMPLETELY uninhabitable in winter, which can last for decades. The Lord of the Vale and his family must spend years and years living in some lower holdfast which offers none of the benefits of the Eyrie.

I will be the first to say that the moon door and the sky cells are completely bad-ass, but at what cost??

1345335640.0,204,self.asoiaf,yg8md,(Spoiler All) A comparison of the plot progression of Dany and Jon.,Badenoch101,250,46,230,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/yg8md/spoiler_all_a_comparison_of_the_plot_progression/,"So here in [/r/asoiaf](/r/asoiaf) we are no strangers to the myriad tinfoil theories on the series and one that had always seemed alittle baseless to me was the 'Jon and Dany will end up together' theory. However despite it being abit too much like a fairy tale ending I have come to notice certain comparisons between Dany and Jons story progression in the series which actually makes this outcome more believable in my eyes.
I'll list to make it quicker.

1) Both unexpectedly fall in love with a barbarian (Drogo/Ygritte) and even resist it at first. Both these relationships end tragically and are actually inadvertantly caused by Dany and Jon themselves. They both have guilt over this.

2) Both have been made to travel beyond Westeros in the series into harsh and cruel lands unknown to them. Furthermore both have survived it, become stronger from it and made allies from different cultures. Notably, Despite arguments from establishments such as the Ghiscari elites for Dany and Nights Watch for Jon, Dany's merciful and empathetic actions to the slaves in Essos mirror Jons attitude to most of the wildlings looking for safety. In short they are of a similar mindset here.

3) Both have a complicated relationship to their ancient families (Stark/Targ). Neither are entirely a part of their familial lineage nor are they entirely seperate from it. They both bear burdens from their familial connections (Jons bastardry, Dany's fear of asassination and then continuation of goal of restoring the throne). This fact i think could help overshadow the fact that the Starks helped overthrow the Targs.

4) Both Dany and Jon found themselves suddenly in positions of power (Nights watch commander/ Queen of Mereen). Both tried to use their position to affect positive change with disaterous results and betrayal.

5) A little less philosophical but still worth the mention as a link, both found a supporter from the Mormont family (Jeor/ Jorah), though I wont go as far as saying Jeor wanted the same from Jon as Jorah wanted from Dany. 

6) The obvious link in Jon and Ghost and Dany and Drogon/Rheagal/Viserion.


Im sure there is more that I noticed on my last re-read that im forgetting. It seems to me that Dany and Jon's plot progression by this point is far too similar to be entirely a coincidence, it seems more feasible upon comparion that they are going to get drawn closer together in the story. From their similar experiences i think they would have a very captivating chemistry to read about. At any rate i was just curious to see if others saw these similarities and what they thought of them... nothing wrong with a little discussion.

1376403034.0,209,self.asoiaf,1ka0wc,[Spoilers All] A twist on a popular Patchface Theory,Salacious-,289,80,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1ka0wc/spoilers_all_a_twist_on_a_popular_patchface_theory/,"I've seen the theory on here that Patchface's prophecies are a prediction from the Drowned God, and that ""under the sea"" means ""in death."" Patchface's prophecies have come true in the past (predicted the Red Wedding) so it is worth looking at.

My theory, instead, is that ""Under the sea"" refers to *The Land of Always Winter*. With that in mind, here are some of his sayings (in no particular order) that refer to ""Under the sea.""

----

1\. ""Under the sea, the crows are white as snow, I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.""

The men of the Night's Watch from the Fist of the First Men are part of the wight army in the Land of Always Winter.

---

2\. ""We will march into the sea and out again. Under the waves we will ride seahorses, and mermaids will blow seashells to announce our coming, oh, oh, oh.”

Into the sea and out again means that they will march against the Others into the Land of Always Winter. Seahorses are dragons, or possibly wyverns (which GRRM has confirmed will be in the series at some point). The mermaid part may refer to the Manderly army, indicating that his forces will survive against the Boltons. Mermaid could also refer to a half other (fish) half human hybrid, indicated by the next quote:

---

3\. ""Under the sea, men marry fishes. They do, they do, they do.""

I think this is a reference to the Night's King, and possibly Craster's children. ""Fishes"" may be the Others, and would refer to some union of man and Other. 

---

4\. ""Under the sea, smoke rises in bubbles, and flames burn green and blue and black,” Patchface sang somewhere. “I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.""

Not too sure about this one. Some sort of sorcery in the Land of Always Winter? 

---

5\. ""Under the sea, the birds have scales for feathers.""

Again, referring to dragons. I think this means that Dany will use her dragons to fight the Others. 

----

6\. ""Under the sea, the old fish eat the young fish, . . ."" 

Again, I think ""Fish"" refers to the inhabitants of the Land of Always Winter. The Others might be cannibals?

----

7\. ""Under the sea, the mermen feast on starfish soup and the serving men are crabs.""

This is the one that I have a problem with. I think that this refers to the upcoming battle between Stannis and the Bolton/Frey/Manderly army. The mermen (Manderly forces) feast on Starfish (Karstark) soup (the ice on the lake will break and they'll all be drowned) and the serving men are crabs (armored knights). 

That interpretation does not work with the theory that ""under the sea"" means ""in the Land of Always Winter."" Any alternate thoughts?",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1376403912.0,,Tawney,True,t3_1ka0wc,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1ka0wc/spoilers_all_a_twist_on_a_popular_patchface_theory/,

1369641992.0,207,self.asoiaf,1f4m9y,(Spoilers All) Regarding Tyrion,DiggSuxNow,253,46,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1f4m9y/spoilers_all_regarding_tyrion/,"So there's been a bit of talk recently about the differences in narration between different POVs, and seems to be quite a bit of debate over how reliable Tyrion's perception of himself is compare to other characters. People seem to believe that perhaps Tyrion has been written to make it so that he sounds better in his own POVs than he does to everyone else, in other words, that Tyrion is a monster in real life but doesn't realise it himself.

In that regard I don't necessarily believe it is true. Let's look at the way other characters perceive him:

* Sansa: This is the most obvious, as we get POVs from her during their marriage. Now Sansa is clearly horrified by the idea of marrying him, not only because of his appearance but also his family, allegiance and the fact that she had hope of escaping KL through the Tyrells. However, she does note in her POV that he is not a monster, and treats her far better than Joffrey would have (I know being better behaved than Joffrey is not setting the bar high, but it's something). She also indicates gratitude that he did not force her to consumate the marriage, especially after hearing about the RW. So Sansa isn't a big Tyrion fan, but she clearly doesn't see him as horrid (other than appearance).

* Catelyn: This one's unusual, as Catelyn's two main interactions with Tyrion are when she arrests him and puts him on trial for attempted murder, and again when she decides to trust him when she frees Jaime. She says in ACOK that she trusts the word of the Imp to free her daughters, not Jaime's honour. This seems a little contradictory, but perhaps suggests that Catelyn's actions when she arrests Tyrion were more based on her perceptions of Lannisters as a whole rather than Tyrion alone (that is, she could imagine Tywin, Jaime or Cersei killing Bran, therefore she doesn't question that Tyrion would). Despite her dislike of Tyrion because they're on other sides, it's hard to say whether she thinks him completely without honour.

* Other Starks: They have frosty relations with Tyrion, but once again this seems more because of his family than he himself. Robb is suspicious towards him when he visits Winterfell after his trip to the wall in AGOT, but that's mainly because he is distrusting of Lannisters as a whole after Bran's fall. Bran notes Tyrion's kindness when he gives him the saddle and says the ""Cripples, bastards and broken things"" line. 

Jon Snow also gets along with him when he travels to the wall. Ned would not have counted Tyrion amongst his friends, but that once again was influenced by a broader distrust of Lannisters. He does believe LF's story about the knife belonging to Tyrion, but he even acknowledges that Catelyn acted rashly.

* Cersei and Tywin: Ok, clearly these guys don't like Tyrion, but they pretty much didn't from the day he was born. Both of them do note that he is not without a degree of intelligence. Tywin once says that Tyrion is full of ""low cunning"", but that is pretty much just a way of Tywin saying ""I don't like you, but you are fairly competent"". I mean, this is the guy who planned the RW, what does he define as ""low cunning"" as opposed to ""skilful diplomacy""?

So whilst they don't like Tyrion, the recognise he's not an idiot. As for his ethics, Cersei in AFFC can't be considered a good source considering she has an irrational paranoia about Tyrion, so she was always going to perceive him as a monster. Tywin doesn't get a POV so it's hard to say, but like above with the ""Low cunning"" comment, he probably is biased so that he would see Tyrion doing something and think it sneaky, but he would have probably done a similar thing in the same circumstances and perceived it as brilliance. Tyrion is his son, after all. 


* Jaime: Jaime was said to treat Tyrion a lot kinder than Cersei or Tywin did. We don't see all that much interaction between the two, but in ASOS when Jaime is leaving camp with Brienne, he remarks about how he and Tyrion would laugh about him sleeping through his own escape, which implies that he enjoyed Tyrion's company. 

The only interaction we've actually seen between them is when Jaime rescues him, which suggests that Jaime knew Tyrion's personality well enough to judge that he wouldn't have killed Joff, and they actually do have a laugh before Jaime mentions Tysha. 

After all that went down that night (Tyrion telling him he was guilty, Tywin dying as a result of Jaime freeing Tyrion, the ""and Moonboy for all I know"" line), I'm sure Jaime's thoughts on Tyrion won't be as high, but they haven't had a scene together since (In fact, I hope that they do meet up again before the end of the books, either on the same or opposing sides).

* Other characters: There are no other POV characters I can think of which directly interact with Tyrion, but there are plenty of non-POV who don't think him horrid. Bronn clearly like him, and not entirely for his gold (""enhances our friendship, really""). Varys tells Tyrion that there are many who knew that he saved KL during the Battle of the Blackwater (they wouldn't publicly acknowledge it, perhaps, but they knew). Hell, the Red Viper puts his life on the line to defend him (yes it was mainly to get at the Mountain, but I believe Oberon saw through the sham trial and knew that it was probably not Tyrion who actually killed Joffrey, and he also indicated he wouldn't have minded Tyrion coming and working with him and his brother in Dorne).

So in conclusion, the POV characters who have directly interacted with Tyrion are:

- Sansa (didn't find him horrible)

- Jon Snow (liked him)

- Bran (Apprehensive, but found him kind)

- Catelyn (Arrested him on a trumped up charge. Later seems to trust his word to an extent. Probably despises his family more than him per se)

- Cersei (Hates him, but is pretty irrational)

- Jaime (Liked him until the night he rescues him)

**tl;dr**: I believe Tyrion doesn't seem to be a monster through other POVs. Most of the characters who have negative opinions of him are because they either don't like any Lannisters as a whole, or Cersei who's always hated him. Is he a perfect character? God no, but he's really not THAT horrendous, and his character is really no worse through others eyes than through his.

1366296827.0,202,self.asoiaf,1clwsh,(Spoilers all) Lady Stoneheart and Jon Snow,Sputnik3001,242,40,162,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1clwsh/spoilers_all_lady_stoneheart_and_jon_snow/,"[In one of the recent previews](http://youtu.be/FlmTBjE2kgg?t=8m12s), it's shown that Melisandre visits Thoros, and there is a short scene where she looks at Beric.

What I found particularly interesting is the look on her face. She actually seems to be shocked at his revival.

I know this could be nothing, but I found it interesting that Melisandre is the only important person around Jon Snow after his ""accident"" at the end of ADWD.

Could it actually be Lady Stoneheart, not Melisandre, that passes the kiss of life onto him? Talking strictly hypothetically, but the show runners are both making Catelyn more regretful towards the way she behaved to Jon, and they're also establishing Melisandre's knowledge of the kiss of life.

So, a wild guess would be that near the end of TWOW, Lady Stoneheart meets up with her children, somehow finds out about Jon's true parentage, and Melisandre asks her to pass on the kiss of life. If you think about it, it'd be kind of heart-breaking, she finally learns her kids are okay, she gets to understand Ned's motives, and she finally accepts Jon, making the ultimate sacrifice to redeem herself.

Then, in ADOS we get a shitload of Azor Ahai/TPTWP kickassery.

EDIT: /u/Zecowsay also reminds about another thing Melisandre mentions:

&gt;Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.

Some of mine are more evidence-based than others. A few are...less so; nevertheless, I will still believe them until GRRM tells me different.

Aside from the generally-accepted ones of R+L=J, Frey pies, etc., here are my more well-thought out ones: 

1. [Littlefinger's entire endgame was designed to ""save"" Catelyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/xvqua/spoilers_and_speculation_all_petyr_baelish_is_a/). Now that she's dead, he's transferred that desire to save the damsel in distress to Sansa. 

2. Benjen Stark is still alive (and is himself). He's being held hostage by the Others and they're planning to use him to get through that gate under the Nightfort that Bran, Jojen, Meera, and Hodor go through. 

3. Bejen witnessed Lyanna's marriage to Rhaegar. It took place in Winterfell before they ran off. The reason Jon has to go into the Stark crypts is because [that's where Lyanna's Targaryen bridal cloak is hidden](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/10pt18/spoiler_allspeculation_whos_gonna_spill_the_beans/c6flxiy) (Credit for that theory goes to /u/angrybiologist). Benjen's guilt over what happened as a result of this (deaths of his brother, father, sister, and many more in the ensuing war) is what prompted him to join the Night's Watch. 

Edit: Adding:

4. Queen Jeyne Stark is the more beautiful queen from Cersei's prophecy. Finding out that she's Maggy's great-granddaughter is what made me believe this one.

I agree with this interpretation of the past. However, I have a somewhat unorthodox idea that in the scope of current events these titles refer to three different people. I think GRRM is going to subvert the idea that one single person is the savior of humanity and this is where I think the three heads of the dragon come into play.

In the House of the Undying, Daenerys comes across a vision of Rhaegar saying 
&gt; He appears to look at Dany then, as if seeing her, and then he adds that ""There must be one more,"" and ""The dragon has three heads.""

Dany thinks on this and often repeats it to herself. I don't think the statement is meant to be taken literally that there will be three dragonriders.  I think instead Rhaegar misinterprets that there needs to be three working against the Others.

**The Prince that was Promised**
Rhaegar in the same vision above believed that his son Aegon was the Prince that was promised saying:
&gt; ""He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire.""

However, I think Rhaegar knew this was incorrect and was something he said to comfort his wife Elia. Additionally, I believe Aegon was killed by Gregor Clegane and that the Aegon in ADWD is a Blackfyre (but that is a topic for another time).  I believe **the real Prince that was Promised is Daenerys**.  Maester Aemon lays out my thoughts quite clearly:
&gt; ""What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. Dragons are neither male nor female, Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years.""

and
&gt; ""Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it.""

Once Maester Aemon has the proper information he is easily able to figure out that Daenerys the Prince that was Promised. 

**Azor Ahai Reborn**
The first clue that lead me on this goose hunt was that Maester Aemon when speaking of Daenerys as the Prince that was Promised, never refers to her as Azor Ahai which I find telling.  Aemon is very familiar with the tale of Azor Ahai. In AFFC/ADWD he specifically marks a passage for Jon to read from *The Jade Compendium* that passage reads:
&gt; ""The pages told of Azor Ahai. Lightbringer was his sword. Tempered with his wife’s blood if Votar can be belived. Thereafter Lightbringer was never cold to the touch, but warm as Nissa Nissa had been warm. In battle the blade burned fiery hot. Once Azor Ahai fought a monster. When he thrust the sword through the belly of the beast, its blood began to boil. Smoke and steam poured from its mouth, its eyes melted and dribbled down its cheeks, and its body burst into flame.""

Yet, Aemon never claims Daenerys is Azor Ahai despite knowing the prophecy.  Additionally in ASOS Aemon asks Melisandre:
&gt; ""It is the war for the dawn you speak of, my lady. But where is the prince that was promised?"" 

Melisandre replies:
&gt; ""He stands before you ... though you lack the eyes to see. Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai come again, the warrior of fire. In him the prophecies are fulfilled. The red comet blazed across the sky to herald his coming, and he bears Lightbringer, the red sword of heroes.""

Melisandre claims that Azor Ahai and the Prince that was Promised are the same person. But it has been established that Melisandre is not the most reliable interpreter (Renly smashing Stannis at KL, thinking Alys Karstark was Arya, etc.) and Maester Aemon never agrees that Prince that was Promised and Azor Ahai are one in the same.
Melisandre may not be the best interpreter of visions or prophecy yet everything she has seen has come true in some way, just not always the way she suspected. Which leads to why I think **Jon Snow is Azor Ahai Reborn** in Melisandre's POV chapter in ADWD she looks into the fires:

&gt; ""I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and R'hllor shows me only Snow.""

Melisandre has found Azor Ahai in Jon Snow but her desire to be right about Stannis blinds her from realizing it.  Jon's actions lead directly to the death of Ygritte which is his Nissa Nissa. And his dream in ADWD is telling:
&gt; ""Burning shafts hissed upward, trailing tongues of fire. Scarecrow brothers tumbled down, black cloaks ablaze. ""Snow,"" an eagle cried, as foemen scuttled up the ice like spiders. Jon was armored in black ice, but his blade burned red in his fist. As the dead men reached the top of the Wall he sent them down to die again. He slew a greybeard and a beardless boy, a giant, a gaunt man with filed teeth, a girl with thick red hair. Too late he recognized Ygritte. She was gone as quick as she’d appeared.""

Assuming R+L=J, this dream could very well be prophetic.  We know that those with Targayen blood have had prophetic dreams before (Daenys the dreamer, Daeron the drunken, Daemon II Blackfyre, and Daenerys has some as well). I believe Jon is seeing what his future holds. Jon's assassination will and subsequent resurrection will act as his rebirth into Azor Ahai. Quickly during the assassination Jon's wounds are smoking, Bowen Marsh is crying giving salt, and Ser Patrek's star is covered in blood thus the red star. 

**The Last Hero**
We receive the story of the Last Hero from Old Nan as she tells it to Bran Stark:
&gt; ""Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow sea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the First Men, who had taken those lands from the children of the forest. Yet here and there in the fastness of the woods, the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept watch. So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the hopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead lands with a sword, a horse, a dog and a dozen companions. For years he searches until he despaired of ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by one his friends died, and his horse, and finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it. And the Others smelled the hot blood in him and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white spiders big as hounds –""

Clearly only one person in the books fights this story and that is **Bran Stark as the Last Hero**.  He alone has sought out the Children of the Forest (with an assist from Bloodraven) and came with Summer (""his dog"") and companions Hodor, Meera, and Jojen (and Coldhands kind of). Bran is not literally alone but he constantly thinks about how isolated he is from everyone else and how lonely he fells.  I feel at some point that his companions will die (either by the wights or something Bloodraven does) and he will suffer their deaths.  
Bran has shown remarkable skinchanging skills and while he may skinchange into a dragon I don't think he has to to be considered one of the dragon's heads (just as I don't necessarily think Jon needs to ride a dragon to be one of the heads).
It is interesting that no where in the books does anyone compare the Last Hero to Azor Ahai or the Prince that was Promised even though the stories of the three are all remarkably similar.  

**TL;DR: By having one mythical person from the past return in three different ways I think the three heads of the dragon are fulfilled in Daenerys Targaryen (The Prince that was Promised), Jon Snow (Azor Ahai Reborn), and Bran Stark (the Last Hero).**

If I had any talent, I'd make an infographic similar to [this](http://religionnerd.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/world-distribution-weighted-thumb32.png) but since I don't, you'll get tables.

I counted 343 chapters in total. Out of these, 282 (82.2%) take place in Westoros, and 61 (17.8%) take place in Essos. Breaking the continents up in regions gives us the following table:

A lot of people seem to think that AA and the PtwP will turn out to be the same person, but what if they aren't? 

From what we know about Rhaegar, he seemed to be a stand-up guy and might have been a great king. Dying ended the possibility that he might have been the PtwP. But does dying preclude every prophecy from being true? 

What if Rhaegar is AA and Lyanna his Nissa Nissa? ""Sword"" has been the euphemism of choice for some characters when talking about someone's penis. The act of sex would be AA metaphorically plunging the sword into his wife. Rhaegar's seed would be the catalyst for him saving the world from the others. Jon Snow would be Lightbringer. His birth would cause Lyanna's death. And he would ALSO be the PtwP. It's a stretch but it would be a cool twist to all the AA speculation.

I was disquieted to read about Tywin Lannister's supposed incompetence. Being an excellent schemer is important, but not necessarily sufficient to win the Game of Thrones. One can also do well by being cautious and relatively inactive. The only important measure is results. Here is my proposed list of the players and pieces:

**Top Tier - Those who are both successful and cunning**

1. Petyr Baelish, Lord of Harrenhal and the Riverlands, Lord Protector of the Vale - Rich and with many allies all across the South, he rose from the son of an unimportant lord to the Master of Coin. He easily plays other pieces off each other. At the end of ADWD, he is incredibly well-situated.

2. Varys, Master of Whispers and secret Targaryen agent -  He is playing a very long game with Illyrio Mopatis and manages to have almost every other contender in the palm of his hand, save Petyr Baelish. He has even had several horses in the race with Viserys, Daenerys, and Aegon.

4. Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North - Bolton wrests control of the North from the Starks and seizes Winterfell in Arya Stark’s name. The masterful destruction of the loyal Stark forces and alliances with the Freys and Lannisters could put him on equal footing with the likes of Baelish. He loses points however for both underestimating the long memories of northmen (Grand Northern Conspiracy) and for eating Frey Pie.

5. Daenerys Targaryen, Queen of Meereen (titles, titles) - Starting with zero friends and three dragons as her only assets, she acquired an enormous army of fearsome warriors and freed tens of thousands of slaves while easily sacking three cities. Aside from being stranded in the Dothraki sea with naught but rags and loose stools, her prospects are outstanding.

6. Stannis Baratheon, King of Westeros - Despite being usurped by his own younger brother and routed by Lannister and Tyrell forces on the Blackwater, Stannis is backed by the Iron Bank of Braavos andpoised to win the North. His loss at Blackwater docks him points, though he has ably recovered thus far. Could argue for placement in the Second Tier.

7. Euron Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands - The Crow's Eye usurped his royal brother and outwitted his warrior brother and niece to seize the Seastone Chair by popular vote at a Kingsmoot. He is downright scary and might have the ability to control dragons. He is presently very well situated.

**Second Tier - Those otherwise successful, but undone by powers outside their control.**

1. Renly Baratheon, Lord of Storm’s End, developed a powerful alliance with the Tyrells and marshalled a massive army of over 100,000 strong - almost certainly would have taken King’s Landing had he not been assassinated by Melisandre’s shadow demon. 

2. Doran Martell, Prince of Sunspear, a controversial entry in the second tier, but he is a patient, capable schemer whose three major plans look OK on paper but never quite work out. He might be able to save the Martell-Targaryen alliance and the Dornish people are unbloodied by the war.

3. Wyman Manderly, Lord of Whiteharbor - His position in the second tier is largely due to future prospects. That, and Frey Pie. He is presently playing the Freys and Boltons false while sending Ser Davos to retrieve the Stark heir. White Harbor survived the war unscathed and he remains rich and well-provisioned for winter. Oh yeah and he built a secret fleet of warships. All that, and Frey Pie.

4. Olenna Tyrell, Queen of Thorns - She helped navigate the Tyrells to the Throne and orchestrated the Purple Wedding which advanced Tyrell power and protected Margaery. She is docked points for allowing her plot to marry Sansa to Willas be thwarted by Baelish. The Tyrell lands are relatively untouched by war, its forces strong, and its grasp on the Throne is strong. We'll see how she handles the Ironborn.

**Third tier - Those with moderate success, but beset by one or several poor decisions**

1. Tywin Lannister, Hand of the King - Lord Tywin would almost certainly be ruling still had he not treated Tyrion so poorly his whole life. Lavishly rich and arguably the most powerful man in the Kingdoms, he won the War of the Five Kings for Houses Lannister and Tyrell.

2. Tyrion Lannister, Seeker of Where Whores Go - Despite successfully maneuvering his sister and other players around and winning the Battle of Blackwater Bay, Tyrion failed to make friends at court which made it easy for Cersei to balance the trial in her favor. His love for whores and his alcoholism ultimately did him in, but he is a capable player and his prospects will improve if he can bring the Second Sons over to Daenerys' cause and become her Hand.

3. Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch - rises from bastardy to Lord based almost exclusively on merit and must navigate the most trying reign of any Lord Commander in memory. He is nonetheless consigned to the third tier for losing the loyalty of his men and compromising the values of the Night's Watch.

4. Walder Frey, Lord of the Twins - always manages to come out on the winning side, and he gets points for the Red Wedding. However, many many Freys have perished since the Red Wedding and his alliances are in peril thanks to Tywin Lannister’s death and Roose Bolton’s upcoming battle with King Stannis. He could belong in the second tier. Also, Frey Pie.

5. Asha Greyjoy, Captain of *Black Wind* - Lady Asha captured a castle and wisely knew when to desert. She is by all accounts a capable warrior and was mostly undone by her father's sad rebellion and Euron's superior planning.

6. Robb Stark, King in the North - He won all the battles and lost the war in the bedchamber. He is the true picture of the third tier.

**Fourth Tier - Those who have been met with little success or are just pieces**

1. Cersei Lannister, Queen Regent - she enjoyed moderate success prior to Tyrion’s arrival in King’s Landing by ruling over 16 years of peace, thwarting Ned Stark, and orchestrating the premature death of Robert Baratheon. After that, however, she was headed off at every turn by Tywin, Tyrion, Petyr, or Varys. Her firstborn died, she lost much of her power to her father and the Tyrells, and by condemning Tyrion in her blind, paranoid rage, she ultimately effected her father’s murder. After that, she kicked off a real hot streak by stocking the Kingsguard with either morons or agents of Petyr Baelish, refusing to pay the Crown’s debt to the Iron Bank, allowing Faith Militant arms, spurning Jaime, and botching her frame job of Margaery Tyrell. To cap it off, she is captured by the Faith and forced to take her walk of shame. She is now at the mercy of a trial by combat, championed by a possibly undead monster.

2. Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King - a nuance-free performance in King’s Landing, capped by his fatal decisions to (a) reveal his hand to Cersei Lannister and (b) trust Littlefinger, kicked off a war and the eventual ruin of his house. Even more brittle than Stannis Baratheon.

3. Theon Greyjoy, Reek - He was dealt a bad hand, but his decisions to first leave Robb’s side and to then take Winterfell have condemned him to the worst fate in Westeros this side of Gregor Clegane.

4. Catelyn Stark, Undead Hanger of Freys - An otherwise capable woman who gave good council to Robb, Lady Stark committed two abominable follies: capturing Tyrion and releasing Jaime. The first led Tywin Lannister to call his banners and the second led to discord in Robb’s camp and severely weakened his position.

5. Sansa Stark, a piece formerly under Cersei Lannister’s control, and now Petyr Baelish, she has never made a move on her own accord other than to reveal her father's plans to Cersei Lannister.

6. Janos Slynt, a piece under Tyrion Lannister’s control, an active player who is manipulated by everyone around him before being forced to take the black and later be beheaded.

7. Robert Baratheon, a piece under both Jon Arryn and Cersei Lannister’s control - He was a great warrior and a terrible player. A drunken, wasteful king who allowed himself to be used and played by the Lannisters.

8. Lysa Arryn, a piece under Petyr Baelish’s control - She murdered her husband at the behest of Littlefinger, who later murders her for likely being insane.

9. Viserys Targaryen, a piece under the control of Varys and Illyrio Mopatis - He both lost the Game of Thrones (failed to use his name to secure alliances and became the Beggar King) and was murdered in a brutally humiliating fashion. By an ally.

10. Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands - He led one failed rebellion that saw the loss of all three of his sons, two to the grave and one to Winterfell. He was later either assassinated by his own brother or fell off a bridge.

11. Arianne Martell, Princess of Dorne - She hatched her Queenmaker scheme which ultimately led to the maiming of Princess Myrcella and the death of a Kingsguard knight.

**Notable Omissions**

* Jaime Lannister and Arya Stark - They are more characters undergoing a transformation rather than contenders in the Game of Thrones.

* Sam Tarly - He did get Jon elected, but he's also more a transformation story.

* Bran Stark - He might later become a player, but for now is an observer rather than a ""piece.""

* Victarion Greyjoy - He is arguably a piece under Euron's power, but may become a player. Jury is still out.

* Aegon - It's too early to tell, though taking Storm's End would be a promising start.

* Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy - These knights are important role players who aren't exactly pieces themselves.

* Bronn - He has raised himself high through luck and skill at arms, but does not strike me as a true player as much as a Lannister piece.

* The various Harzoos - I don't really care.

From my understanding Rickon was around 3 years of age when Ned &amp; Cait left for KL. Jon Snow went to the wall leaving him with only Maester Luwin &amp; Robb as adults.

Robb is also described as pretty much ignoring Rickon for the most part, and is to busy acting as the lord of winterfell and later king in the north. 

If I remember right it is also shown that Rickon doesn't really listen to Luwin at all, so essentially he is a 3 year old running free with no one taking care of him. He's described as aggressive. 

Reading the series we also see how their direwolves reflect the personality of their owner and shaggydog is described as feral &amp; untamed even attacking Luwin.

I can't remember if it was ADWD or AFFC but there it was revealed that Rickon was on Skagos, who's people are described as savages &amp; cannibals. It is unknown if he's living amonst them, or if he's just hiding in the island eitherway, he is now about 8 (Edit: 5 years, I counted wrong) years old being raised under this conditions.

Where he's smart is that his ""holdings"" are contiguous and would be formidable if joined. I wonder if he's planning on making a play on a larger prize at some point.

1375769045.0,200,self.asoiaf,1jsnrl,(Spoilers All) A Small Twist in the Future of Jaime and Cersei That Makes it Much More Exciting,Boromir_Stark,244,44,155,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1jsnrl/spoilers_all_a_small_twist_in_the_future_of_jaime/,"I, like many, am somewhat expecting an eventual showdown between the Lannister twins. One that may or may not end with Jaime ensuring Cersei's ""golden silence."" 

However, I noticed a small detail today that may make any future showdown even more layered and dramatic. As the reader, we know that Jaime has effectively abandoned Cersei, commanding her plea for help to be thrown into the fire. He is consumed with bitter thoughts about the ""Queen of Whores"" and it seems like the sort of bitterness that will continue to grow and gnaw at him.

Cersei, on the other hand, knows none of this. She sent her plea for help fulling expecting the love of her life to come rushing in to save her. If she knew he burnt the letter, she might feel different, but she doesn't!

 Here's the small detail: long before enough time has passed for Cersei to guess that Jaime has ignored her, Jaime meets up with Brienne and disappears from the Riverlands. He does not appear to tell anyone where he is going or even that he is leaving, and thus is likely to be presumed captured. This is the version of events that will make it back to Cersei, and so she'll have a very different view of what happened than reality.

To summarize:
Cersei's opinion before sending the letter: The love of her life, Jaime, will surely come riding to her rescue in dramatic fashion. 
Reality: Jaime burns her letter and disappears with Brienne.
Cersei's opinion after hearing of Jaime's disappearance: The love of her life, Jaime, was surely riding to her rescue before he was captured by the enemy. No reason to think he isn't still dedicated to saving her.

Here's where it gets a bit speculative, but I think it's pretty reasonable. I can imagine Cersei in this situation to begin to fantasize about her heroic knight escaping capture to save her. She tells Kevan that she knows Jaime isn't dead when they haven't heard from him, as she believes she would know. So she definitely thinks he is still coming. I believe Cersei will continue to build up an idealized image of Jaime as her white knight riding to save her, and thus will be overcome with positive emotions if she ever sees Jaime again.

On the other hand, (pun intended) if Jaime survives his experience with Brienne, Lady Stoneheart, and the BWB, I think we can all agree he will not do so unscathed. He'll be coming out of that with all sorts of emotional trauma. Now, remember his ""Queen of Whores"" mentality at the outset of his travels with Brienne. It is my belief that this hatred of his sister will continue to fester throughout his coming experiences, definitely spurred on by the fact that Cersei can share some blame for his current predicament. If he does survive and makes his way towards Cersei again, I think it will be with a heart full of rage and a burning enmity for his twin.

So the scene is: An extremely desperate Cersei finally sees her white knight, Jaime, coming towards her, and knows she is saved and loved and that all is right in the world. A bitter and traumatized Jaime finally sees the ""Queen of Whores"" and target of his hatred, and knows that he has to kill her. I can totally see them rushing towards each other, with very different intentions.

I really hope it plays out similar to this.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,,True,t3_1jsnrl,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1jsnrl/spoilers_all_a_small_twist_in_the_future_of_jaime/,
1371135215.0,202,self.asoiaf,1g9quu,(Spoilers ALL) Speculation on the next Dance with Dragons,dtm9k,277,75,327,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1g9quu/spoilers_all_speculation_on_the_next_dance_with/,"I've been rolling this theory around in my head for a while and wanted to get it written down. I've been thinking about what will happen between Dany and Aegon if/when Dany finally reaches Westeros. I think by the time Dany lands Aegon will be well established within the nobility, and Dany will incite an uprising of the lower classes to overthrow him.

For the sake of this, I'm assuming Varys and Illario married Dany to Khal Drogo to get rid of her, paving the way for Aegon, and that they did not expect her to escape the Dothraki.

So right now Aegon is pretty well positioned within the Game, he has started gathering allies amongst Westori nobility. Perhaps most importantly he has the support of Varys, one of the 2 biggest players in the game. I think with Varys' continued support Aegon is well positioned to gather the allegiances of many major houses.

Dany on the other hand currently has no Westori noble allies and has apparently lost the Varys/Illario support with Varys throwing down for Aegon. However, what she does have is a history of overthrowing current regimes.

Going back to her time with the Dothracki, Dany has consistently been about saving the downtrodden, be it Mirri-Maz Dur or the 3 cities she sacked/liberated because they practice slavery. Dany has never interacted well with the local nobility/ruling class and in almost every case the ruling class has been overthrown or suffered substantial casualties. Her chief advisors are not nobles, but members of her group who have risen up the ranks, eg Grey Worm.

Furthermore, while Dany has been busy overseas, a new religion has taken hold in Westeros, the faith of R'hollor. The practitioners of R'hollor are primarily from the lower classes of Westeros and literally worship the fire. I imagine they would welcome a liberator on dragon back, and that Dany could incite the unwashed masses to revolt.

This would position the nobility of Westeros backing Aegon's claim against the lower classes backing Dany. While the nobility would posses the arms, knights and wealth to win battle, we all know from the field of fire that when dragons are involved the size of an army means nothing.

Ghost has been his companion for a long time now, sleeping with him day and night and protecting him. And yet Jon isn't concerned at all with his disappearance? In the books Jon has to explain to Ghost that he needs to leave him when he goes over the Wall. In the show, Jon just peaces out, something completely out of character and frankly, cruel. 

Basically, the show needs to somehow address this, instead of having Jon climbing the wall and focusing on kissing his new lady. And now my rant is ended. 

EDIT: To all the people saying where Ghost is in the books and how Jon leaves him, I know that. My main complaint here is that Jon has not even acknowledged Ghost's disappearance. He just climbed a 700 foot wall, leaving Ghost on the other side of it, without even looking for his wolf.

We all know the famous, “The North Remembers” monologue, but just in case, here it is:

&gt;My son Wednel came to The Twins a guest. He ate Lord Walder’s bread and salt, and hung his sword upon the wall to feast with friends. And they murdered him. *Murdered*, I say, and may the Freys choke upon their fables. I drink with Jared, jape with Symond, promise Rhaegar the hand of my own beloved granddaughter…but never think that means I have forgotten. The north remembers, Lord Davos. The north remembers, and the mummer’s farce is almost done. My son is home.&gt; 

Another line that really got me in the same chapter: 

&gt;Roose Bolton has Lord Eddard’s daughter. To thwart him, White Harbor must have Ned’s son… and the direwolf. The wolf will prove the boy is who we say he is, and should the Dreadfort attempt to deny him.

Besides having a cool Latin name (Mimus polyglottos), the mockingbird imitates the sounds of creatures around it to achieve its goals of protecting territory. As others have suggested, Sansa is already adept at saying things she does not mean (singing a song that isn't hers). Perhaps this bird imagery around her indicates she will take on Littlefingers role and become THE mockingbird (whether or not she partakes in his downfall/disappearance). 

This would ""fit"" Sansa in with the other surviving Stark children, all of which are in training to hide their true selves by taking on the aspects of something else. Bran, the true warg, transfers into other things and hides in them. Arya transfers the faces of others onto herself and hides behind them. Rickon, the scared little boy, hides behind his wilding persona. And Sansa hides behind the voices and words of others.

While I was briefly reading up on the physiological effects of castration the other day, mostly thinking about the Unsullied and poor Theon, I noticed an interesting fact. Apparently, [castration prevents male pattern baldness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration#Medical_consequences), at least when the castration occurs before the onset. 

Varys was castrated as a young man, and so clearly would have still his hair, implying that his baldness is a choice. While there are many other characters in the series that are bald, it does not appear to be a common style as most of those characters are older. 

Others have noted elsewhere that the use of his genitals in a priest of R'hllor's ceremony implies that he may have royal blood, which as we all know is of greater value in the Red God's rituals. 

Perhaps he shaves his head to hide the tell-tale silver hair of the Targaryens? I don't think his eye color is ever mentioned in the books, though I haven't made a concerted effort to check. But he does tend to wear bright colored clothing and is a master of disguise, so if he had the violet Targaryen eyes, he could hide it. 

My theory is that he is the son of Prince Aerion (the guy who tried to drink wildfire because he thought it would turn him into a dragon).

     No building remained on the hill
     Where once a great battle had been.

     The gates of the tower were gone.
     Its stones the silent graves adorned.
     Rusted swords of mourning marked each cairn.
     “Kingsguard don’t flee,” The White Bull had warned.

     And two high towers fell that day,
     And Dawn was not to rise again: 
     And septons in brown now walking around
     Were singing of three with unbended knees.

Most of her family has been murdered (incl. Bran and Rickon, to her knowledge), she's been on the run for a long time, and she's been immersed in an environment where death is omnipresent and life is worth little. In such a situation, a man can make some allowances.

That being said, she's a ten-year-old ruthless murder machine. I don't have a full count of all those she's killed, but I'm sure it would be quite a tally, especially including those deaths she had an indirect or assisting role in (like the whispers and the weasel soup). She goes from killing a stableboy in the heat of the moment to coldly tricking a guard to bend over so she can slit his throat, as well as having Jaqen H'ghar murder Weese just because he was abusive to her, in a terrifyingly short period of time. What ordinary ten-year-old girl would, upon learning that she had a private assassin, have him kill her boss in the kitchen because he occasionally hit her and wouldn't share his goddamn capon?!?

Then there's the prayers. I find it quite disturbing that she, every night, recites a list of people who she not only would like to see dead, but whose deaths she actively works towards and who she is willing to murder at any opportunity. Honestly, some of them haven't done anything especially bad, like Dunsen and Polliver, whose only real crimes were being part of Gregor Clegane's band.

And then there's the tavern scene. Just... the *stabbing*... and repeating the questions, over and over and over... And then, when she's done with him, finishing off that squire, just like that. It's chilling. Of all the kids, she's adapted to the war quicker and more fully than anyone, even Jon. He's still got his honor, despite doing some questionable things; she happily sails off to Braavos to become an assassin. There's quite a divide there.

In the end, the truly frightening thing is how quickly and easily she has given up her innocence. Yes, there was some resistance along the way, but they end up being mere stumbles in a general headlong rush into darkness.

Nope. Busy teaching some little girl how to swordfight.

* Varys having a heart attack, because he is a fat middle aged man with a lot of stress in his life. Actually, in its own way, I think this might be good. Varys is being built up too much.

It would be nice if there's a reminder that he's not infallible (but I still don't want him to have a heart attack).

* Dany dies without ever reaching Westeros. She's a terrible politician and she can't keep her dragons under control. Actually, just due to how irritating her chapters have been recently, I'm starting to root for this.

GRRM likes to follow a certain symmetry in his writing and to me it seems likely that Bran will have the last ever chapter. Not only does it fit since he had the first one but Bran also makes sense as a logical choice for the final chapter.

As we know, Bran is in the north with the assumed last CotF and has the ability to see through the weirwood trees. Bran also will likely play an important role in ending this long winter (debatable but I personally believe he will make a difference) so he could have important insights to the final showdown whatever it may be. Also, his ability to see through the weirwood trees at any time could be a useful device to tie up all of the loose ends and show where the Seven Kingdoms stand after everything is said and done.

Bran, similar to Bloodraven, will also have an extended lifespan so it could be a case where his final chapter is many years after the final events of the books and shows how everything turned out.

I'm thinking that he was actually meant as a parody of more traditional fantasy characters.

First off, him and his gang bear a striking resemblance to Rand Al'thor and his friends from The Wheel of Time. You have Quentyn, the average-looking, middle-of-the-road leader, his fast-talking jokester friend (Gerris Drinkwater/Matt Cauthon), and a third that's large and strong, yet intelligent (Archibald Yronwood/Perrin Aybara). 

The second point is that his storyline matches that of a typical fantasy protagonist. A young man journeys to far off lands on a quest for some enchanted MacGuffin (In this case, it's a wife). In The Wheel of Time, the characters are always talking about how they're on an adventure, ""like in the stories."" This is echoed by Quentyn's claim that he's on a ""grand adventure"" (pretty funny in hindsight, if you like dark humor).

The final point is his death. As readers with knowledge of ASOIAF's world, Quentyn's plan seems obviously stupid, but think about it: would it have been so stupid in another series?

I hear people talk about what plans she might have, why she's helping Stannis, and so on. There is so much evidence that Stannis isn't Azor Ahai, and it is possible that she knows this, but feeds Stannis the lie for her own ends. But I never hear any support for the theory that she's just a crazed religious fanatic who can't admit she made a mistake, which I believe to the case.

Melisandre definitely has powers. There is no question about that. But we know that her powers are not unique to her (Morqorro's predictions appear to be as accurate as, if not more accurate than, hers), that her powers are not limitless (she apparently almost fainted trying to keep the glamour up around ""Mance"" while he burnt), and that she admits to herself that she frequently misinterpretes her visions (thinking that Arya was on her way to the Wall).

Furthermore, Melisandre is obstensibly part of a larger organization. We know that this organization is centralized to some extent; it buys slaves, and is capable of sending its members on missions. But we never see Melisandre communicating with this organization, and no other Red Preist is ever seen or heard to mention that Stannis is believed to be Azor Ahai. This implies that, if Stannis is Azor Ahai reborn, then Melisandre knows something that no other Red Preist in the world has seen or acted upon.

That being said, I believe that she honestly, 100% believes that Stannis is Azor Ahai, but is just wrong about it. The above can all be used as evidence that she's just pretending to believe it; however, her POV chapter appears to show an honest devotion to Stannis. As with so many other predictions, she's somehow just misinterpreted it; however, as we've seen with her other misinterpretations, she never admits that she might be wrong until after it has been proven. She doesn't have any intention other then helping Azor Ahai defeat the other and save the world; her ego is just getting in the way of her doing it properly.

Martin has invested much time in building her up throughout the series.

I think this is a remarkably clever red herring by GRRM.   Let me first state my reasons for why I think it would be foolish for the QoT or Littlefinger to want to kill Joffrey.   
  
1st)  There is no guarantee the Lannisters would marry Margaery to Tommen.  With Joffrey gone the Tyrell claim to the throne is non-existent.  You would think they would have at least waited until Marge was with child.  
  
2nd) Littlefinger’s entire powerbase comes from brokering the Tyrell/Lannister alliance.  If it falls apart he falls out of favor.  
  
So with that being said, who killed Joffrey?  I began poring over ASOS looking for evidence of another with the intent of placing the blame on Tyrion.  I thought it would be delightful if the “unreliable narrator” that GRRM is so fond of could extend to something as grand as this.  Tyrion taking credit for it later (we think as a lie as readers) would be even more ironic.  What I found though was even more shocking.  
  
Let’s begin with a few choice excerpts from Tyrion (chapter 60).   
  
&gt;  my lady,"" said Shae wistfully. ""Couldn't I come serve at table? I so want to see the pigeons fly out of the pie.""  
  
&gt; Sansa looked at her uncertainly. ""The queen has chosen all the servers.""    

Which queen though?  It is implied Cersei but could it be the Queen of Thorns or even Margaery?  
  
Now let’s take a look at the finale so to speak.  
 
&gt; 	**A serving man placed a slice of hot pigeon pie in front of Tyrion and covered it with a spoon of lemon cream.** The pigeons were well and truly cooked in this pie, but he found them no more appetizing than the white ones fluttering about the hall. Sansa was not eating either. ""You're deathly pale, my lady,"" Tyrion said. ""You need a breath of cool air, and I need a fresh doublet."" He stood and offered her his hand. ""Come.""

&gt; But before they could make their retreat, Joffrey was back. ""Uncle, where are you going? You're my cupbearer, remember?""

&gt; ""I need to change into fresh garb, Your Grace. May I have your leave?""

&gt; ""No. I like the look of you this way. Serve me my wine.""  



&gt; The king's chalice was on the table where he'd left it. Tyrion had to climb back onto his chair to reach it. Joff yanked it from his hands and drank long and deep, his throat working as the wine ran purple down his chin. ""My lord,"" Margaery said, ""we should return to our places. Lord Buckler wants to toast us.""
  
Here is where we all assume the poisoning happens.  Tyrion left the cup on the table, the QoT or a servant spiked the punch and Joffrey dies.  But wait, Joffrey doesn’t start choking yet.  When Maester Cressen drinks the Strangler in the ACOK prologue he cannot even mutter another word and that was only half a gulp.  
    
&gt;  There was only half a swallow of wine remaining when she offered it back to him.  “And now you.”  
...  
&gt; He let the empty cup drop from his fingers to shatter on the floor.  ""He does have power here, my lord,"" the woman said.  ""And fire cleanses.""  At her throat, the the ruby shimmered redly.  
  
&gt;  **Cressen tried to reply, but his words caught in his throat.**  His cough became a terrible thin whistle as he strained to suck in air.  
    
So mere moments after swallowing the strangler poison Cressen cannot even breathe let alone speak.  After downing *an entire goblet of wine* though something more happens to Joffrey.  

&gt; ""My uncle hasn't eaten his pigeon pie."" Holding the chalice one-handed, Joff jammed his other into Tyrion's pie. **""It's ill luck not to eat the pie,"" he scolded as he filled his mouth with hot spiced pigeon. ""See, it's good.""** Spitting out flakes of crust, he coughed and helped himself to another fistful. ""Dry, though. Needs washing down."" Joff took a swallow of wine and coughed again, more violently.  
  

Joffrey coughs first from the pie and then finishes his wine....  
  
  
&gt;  ""I want to see, kof, see you ride that, kof kof, pig, Uncle. I want . . . "" His words broke up in a fit of coughing.

&gt; Margaery looked at him with concern. ""Your Grace?""

&gt;  ""It's, kof, the pie, noth - kof, pie."" Joff took another drink, or tried to, but all the wine came spewing back out when another spate of coughing doubled him over. His face was turning red. ""I, kof, I can't, kof kof kof kof . . . "" The chalice slipped from his hand and dark red wine went running across the dais.  
  

Could it be that it wasn't the wine that was poisoned at all, but the pie.  Yet the pie wasn't meant for Joffrey it was meant for Tyrion and who would want Tyrion dead?  We have two distinct possibilities.  
  
The Queen of Thorns wanted Tyrion dead because of his marriage to Sansa.  With Tyrion out of the picture there would be no one to stop them from spiriting Sansa off to marry Willas.  
  
Or in a cruel twist of fate Cersei, in an attempt to kill Tyrion, murdered her own son with poison.  This seems even more likely when we consider the QoT reaction to Joffrey:  
  
&gt; ""He's choking,"" Queen Margaery gasped.

&gt; Her grandmother moved to her side. ""Help the poor boy!"" the Queen of Thorns screeched, in a voice ten times her size. ""Dolts! Will you all stand about gaping? Help your king!""  
    
And Joffrey dies, not from a sip of wine, not from being a cruel malicious bastard to the small folk, for treating Sansa like an object.  He dies because he couldn't help but mock and degrade his uncle Tyrion.  
  
tl;dr  -  Joffrey was poisoned by the pie not the wine and it is likely Cersei is the one who did it or perhaps it was the Queen of Thorns and Littlefinger",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1368404718.0,,Stark,True,t3_1e76oo,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1e76oo/spoilers_allan_accidental_death/,

It seems that the best candidate for this is Aegon, who, as has been pointed out on here, could easily be a Blackfyre or other pretender. So if Aegon is the Mummer's Dragon who is the mummer; the answer Varys.

Throughout the novels we see Varys take on a number of disguises, and use a variety of mummer's tricks to move secretly throughout the kingdoms. Multiple characters comment on this, and we know that Varys was at some point trained by a group of Mummers.

Furthermore, Varys throughout the first four novels never endorses a single person for the Iron Throne, he claims he is serving the realm, but doesn't seem to support any of the claimants to the Throne. That is, until he takes out Kevan Lannister and reveals he believes Aegon should be King. This is his first full-fledged endorsement of someone for the throne, and seems to add more credence to Aegon being the 'mummer's dragon' and a Blackfyre pretender.

**TL;DR Varys is the Mummer mentioned in Dany's prophesy making Aegon the Mummer's Dragon who Dany must be wary of**

EDIT: I've seen the theory on here before that Aegon is the Mummer's Dragon, but never seen Varys referred to as the Mummer. I think the definition of Mummer's Dragon given by Dany and brought up by u/xiann is a red herring, it what Dany thinks a Mummer's Dragon is, not necessarily the actual definition.

The bastard born from Barbra Bracken was Aegor Rivers, or as some of you might know him as Bittersteel. On the other hand, the bastard born from Mysella Blackwood was Bryden Rivers, also known as Bloodraven.

Tyrion has the odds stacked against him from the opening of ACOK to his departure from KL at the end of ASOS. Several events have led me to believe the following thesis points:

1) Tywin intended for Tyrion to die in King's Landing.

2) Tywin first intended for Tyrion to die at Blackwater.

3) Tywin eventually came to realize that Joffrey would be a terrible King.

4) Tywin used Tyrion as a scapegoat, and conspired with Highgarden to murder Joffrey and place Tommen on the Iron Throne.

5) Tywin's plan was foiled/interrupted by a singular event: Jamie's refusal to leave the Kingsguard. Jamie's reaction to his father's ensuing rebuke, led to Jamie releasing Tyrion, who in turn murdered Tywin.

**Evidence**

- The previous four Hands of the King all died. Tywin was abundantly aware of this fact.

- Ser Mandon Moore was specifically assigned to accompany Tyrion during the battle. Obviously, Tyrion was nearly killed by him, and was only saved by the miraculous intervention of Podrick Payne. 

- Tyrion's attempts to investigate Moore's attack were stymied and eventually dropped, as he was forced into a marriage with Sansa Stark, then eventually arrested for Joffrey's murder.

- In ASOS, Tyrion POV, Joffrey openly rebukes Tywin. Tyrion notes that Tywin was ""much more upset than he let on"". Joffrey clearly was displaying his inability to lead the Kingdom, nor his capacity to be led around by the nose and told what to do. Bronn had implied this in ACOK. In totality, Tywin had to have seen that Joffrey would have never become a successful King. His invocation of Tywin's ""fear of Aerys"" was particularly egregious.

- It has long been discussed that Tyrion may have been Aerys's lovechild with Joanna Lannister, Tywin's wife. I won't rehash all the evidence for this here, but needless to say, there is the possibility that this is true. Tyrion's dragon dreams, Tywin's hatred of Tyrion (which obviously has other explanations as well), Tywin's dying declaration (you are no son of mine), Tywin's refusal to grant Casterly Rock to his only remaining heir not already pledged to a life of non-Lordship... 

- Tywin is in a spectacularly complex and troubling situation. He needs an heir to Casterly Rock. He doesn't want to use Tyrion, for whatever reason. He can't get Jamie out of the Kingsguard, even following Joffrey's death. He has to marry Cersei off to someone. He also doesn't seem to want to kill Tyrion outright. Now, the initial response is ""of course he doesn't. Tyrion is his son."" That being said, Tywin has put Tyrion in a position of extreme danger before, for little potential gain. Why was Tyrion sent into battle in AGOT? Why was he ordered to King's Landing as Hand? Why was he married to the one person who could essentially incite half a continent to want to murder him?

Thus, I would posit that Tywin took the opportunity of Joffrey's assassination (which may have been completed with his complicity with LF and Highgarden) to rid himself of Tyrion. Tywin was present at the wedding. He could have easily stopped Cersei from ordering the arrest. He could have easily brought Cersei back from accusing Tyrion. He chose not to. Why not? He has no other heir (presumably). What interest does it serve Tywin Lannister to have his only remaining heir executed/banished before the whole of the realm?

In conclusion, I think Tywin wanted Tyrion dead. He wanted Joffrey dead. He could kill two birds with one stone. Sansa's disappearance complicated matters, as LF may have turned on Tywin in this regard. The likely assassin, the Queen of Thorns (or another Tyrell, perhaps Margaery) would not have been so bold without the say-so of the Hand of the King. Further, there is no evidence that Tywin had the same enmity towards Highgarden that Cersei displayed later in AFFC. If Tywin had lived, it is doubtful that the same problems would have arisen. Tommen would have married Margaery and the Tyrells and Lannisters would have cemented their alliance further. Only Tywin's death and Cersei's stupidity ruined this strong alliance.

Obviously, there are arguments against all of this, but I will leave that to you wonderful redditors to parse out, if you choose.

**TL;DR** Tywin may have allowed Joffrey's death in a conspiracy with Highgarden to also rid himself of Tyrion.

Now, as we know from the epilogue to ASOS, the resurrected Catelyn has taken on the identity of Lady Stoneheart and has taken over the Brotherhood without Banners for the purpose of slaying as many Freys as she can. Moreover, as Wyman Manderly has reminded us, The North Remembers, and they too will seek a bloody path of vengeance against House Frey. However, the fact is that there are so many Freys means that it's rather unlikely for them all to be baked into pies and slain by outlaws. Such a practice would just take too long. Instead, the main and most likely way for the Freys to get karma'd is a large sort of extinction event, but who would cause such a thing? The Freys themselves.

It's been foreshadowed throughout the books that, when Lord Walder dies, House Frey may get rather competitive for the seat of Lord of the Crossing. The line of succession is essentially memorized by Big Walder and Little Walder, many of Lord Walder's descendents name their offspring in his honor to seek his favor, and the tensions among his brood seek to tear the House apart. In AFFC, Cersei comments that Lord Walder's successor would be more than willing to trot out some undesirable relatives. And as Merret Frey states in his epilogue:

&gt; He [Lord Frey] could not possibly last much longer, all his sons agreed. *And when he goes, everything will change, and not for the better*

[Galanix's Guide to Westerosi Succession] (http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/16mqp1/spoilers_all_complete_guide_to_westerosi/)

The above link has the complete listing of House Frey's line of succession. It's very long. Rather than analyzing each one, I will be focusing on the major contenders for the seat of Lord of the Twins or those who may otherwise be significant.

### **Edwyn Frey and Black Walder**

It is impossible to discuss one brother in this context without the other. Edwyn is the current heir, and after Edwyn's daughter comes Black Walder. For those looking at the family tree, they are the grandsons of the deceased Stevron Frey, Lord Walder's eldest son, by way of Stevron's eldest son via Stevron's first wife, Ryman Frey. Ryman was slain by the BWB on his way back to the Twins. Ryman had three sons, Edwyn (who married Janyce Hunter), Black Walder, and finally Petyr ""Pimple"" Frey (deceased, married Mylenda Caron).

These two are at the top of the line of succession, and thus have the most legal claim to the seat. But there's some complications. Firstly, know that these two are described as being rather hateful, cold, and easily angered. Generally not nice guys. But as much as they're like to toss out half the House when they takeover, they hate each other even more (as stated by Merrett Frey). When their father, Ser Ryman, died, Edwyn immediately thought to blame Black Walder, and tells Jaime he believes that Black Walder will kill him next. When Lord Walder dies (likely in TWOW), this cold feud will turn hot.

Now, here's where things get interesting. Black Walder is unmarried, and has slept around quite a bit within the Frey household. His affairs include relations with Fair Walda, Gatehouse Ami, Lord Walder's 7th wife, and most importantly, the wives of both his brothers. This casts paternity doubts on several Freys, most importantly Edwyn's young daughter. Combine this with Big Walder and Little Walder placing Black Walder as fourth, and later third in line when (at those times), he should have been fifth and fourth indicates that Edwyn's daughter Walda is not expected to be a contender. Combine this with our knowledge of Black Walder's affairs, and it could very well be that Walda is another bastard and Edwyn has no legitimate offspring, and if Big and Little Walder believe it, then part of Black Walder's play for the Twins could be declaring Walda illegitimate, thus meaning the only thing in between him and his seat is Edwyn. No matter who wins in the end, one of these two will die. And once that is over with, both are fully willing to exile most of the rest of their house without any guilt. The rest of Stevron Frey's progeny do not seem to be of any note, nor are the remainder of Aenys, Perriane, or Jared Frey's offspring, and are thus unlikely to be major contenders. Though there is an Aegon ""Bloodborn"", an outlaw.

### **Emmon Frey**

Emmon is the second son of Lord Walder, married to Genna Lannister, and is currently serving as Lord of Riverrun. Stevron's offspring are all ahead of him in the legal line, but things may get a bit quirky with the line of succession in the Frey civil war. However, as the Lord of Riverrun (though not Lord Paramount of the Riverlands) Emmon still stands at a fairly good position regardless of whether he inherits the Twins. It is unlikely that he and his offspring will attempt to seize the Twins.

However, he may very well be seen as a refuge for many fleeing Freys. Riverrun has a garrison of 300, is a fairly defensible castle, can call on a reliable bit of Lannister support, and Emmon does not seem to be a man who has any feuds with his family (though who knows if Genna would truly allow any Freys in). Despite this though, the fact that Emmon and his children are essentially 'in the way' of the line advancing could cause a conflict for any major players for the seat later down the line, especially if other Freys who are 'in the way' flee to Riverrun, but ultimately it presents an obstacle.

Or at least it would if Emmon Frey had any sort of expected lifespan. He has replaced the Tully's as the owner of Riverrun. And there is a Tully running around, leading a pack of outlaws, hunting down Freys. And one of those outlaws seems to have found a place as a singer in Genna's household. In Riverrun. The math here is simple. Hopefully Genna will live, because Genna's pretty awesome. But that's a prominent Frey removed from the equation (even if some of his children are elsewhere). Moreso if Lady Stoneheart waits until after the Freys collapse and some go to Riverrun (if that happens).

### **Offspring of Amarei Crakehall, The Third Lady Frey**

None of these are likely to make any major plays, but, for the sake of thoroughness, it is worthwhile to detail where they stand.

Hosteen Frey is the eldest of this brood, and he is in command of the Frey forces at Winterfell. Stannis refers to him as 'Ser Stupid'. Let's put our money on him getting killed by Stannis the Mannis. Many of these Freys are at Darry with Gatehouse Ami, another member of this group, and may also be a home for fleeing Freys, but it is hard to tell. If Lady Stoneheart is able to infiltrate Darry as she has Riverrun, she cross many Freys off her list, but the ravaged lands of Darry could be facing winter related problems instead. Others, like with many Freys, are scattered across Westeros (and some in Essos) as squires, pages, septons, etc. The only other one of note is Fat Walda, the wife of Roose Bolton, who may very well be at risk of Ramsay.

### **Lame Lothar Frey**

Aaaaaand we're back to a major player. Lothar Frey is the Steward of the Twins, and while he is far far down the line, if the line gets thrown out the window then he is a man who is very likely to win it all. Lothar is the twelfth son of Lord Walder, born to Alyssa Blackwood. Despite being son number 12, keep in mind that sons 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, and 10 are dead, son 2 seems to be doomed to die at Riverrun, son 6 is at risk of Stannis, and son 5 is a septon. This leaves sons 8 and 11 left (not to mention the progeny of the other sons), and son 8 has no children. Frankly, House Frey would have to increase GRRM's body count by half for Lothar to take the title of Lord of the Crossing by lineage, so I somewhat doubt that's how it will happen as there are so many descendents scattered about.

Luckily for Lothar, he doesn't need to depend on lineage. Lothar is described as intelligent, cunning, and well spoken, and is clearly trusted and liked enough by Lord Walder to have been made steward, to have been allowed to lead the negotiations with Robb at Riverrun regarding Edmure's wedding, and planning most of the details of the Red Wedding with Lord Roose Bolton (it being Lothar's idea to use the song ""The Rains of Castamere"" as the signal). Merrett Frey describes him as being particularly dangerous, and judging by his character, it's in a wholeheartedly different manner of dangerous than Black Walder.

### **The Rest Of Them**

Most of the rest of the Freys are rather decent people, or simply irrelevant, aside from Big Walder, who is at Winterfell and may also fall victim to Stannis Justice. Lothar's full blooded siblings are minor. Lord Walder's living children off his next wife, Bethany Rosby, are Perwyn Frey (who held serious Stark sympathies), a maester at Longbow Hall, Olyvar Frey (Robb's squire), and Roslin, Edmure's loving wife. Personally, I think it'd be funny for Edmure and Roslin to wind up as heirs, but it's both horribly unlikely and just flat out not gonna happen. The children of Lord Walder's next wife, Annara Farring, could possibly also be Black Walder's, but it's hard to tell, and likely won't as none of them are, as of yet, important.

The only other Frey of note isn't technically a Frey, but is Bastard Walder. Bastard Walder obviously has a very *very* long road ahead if he seeks to take the Twins as, even if legitimized, he is behind all other trueborn descendents of Lord Walder. And there's a lot of them. However, Bastard Walder is of note because, despite his low ranking in inheritance, he is regarded as rather competent and a ferocious fighter. His reputation as a warrior has earned him several responsibilities among the house, and odds are he will not be a player for the seat but instead may wind up as an ally of somebody who is. Wedding his daughter to a male heir is the closest he'll get. He fiercely defends Edwyn in the feud at Riverrun between the Freys and the other lords, though this could be him defending the family (as well as a likely heir to the Twins) more than particular loyalty to Edwyn. He is also found with Lothar on two occasions, the first being when Lothar treats with Robb at Riverrun (he leads Lothar's guard) and the second being when he and Lothar welcome Robb to the Twins for the wedding. Again, this could simply be Bastard Walder obeying orders rather than an allegiance to Lothar, but the seeds are there if this goes forward.

### **The Verdict**

Ultimately, due to interference from Lady Stoneheart or Stannis Baratheon, the likely remaining major players among the Freys are Edwyn, Black Walder, and Lothar. The rest have either not been made major characters, or are holed up in Darry. Edwyn has the advantage of being the next in line, and when Lord Walder dies will be able to immediately remove his rivals (or as stated at the beginning, name them the architects of the Red Wedding and have them killed or Walled). However, this also puts a major target on his back, particularly by Black Walder. Black Walder, in turn, merely needs to eliminate Edwyn, name First Walda illegitimate, and the Twins are his, however his reputation puts a target on his back. Lothar, while the cleverest of the bunch, likely has been working up enough support to make a play for the Twins when Lord Walder dies to circumvent the line of succession, however his reputation for his cunning and as a rival may make him an inconvenient relative for Edwyn or Black Walder to have around, and his position as architect of the Red Wedding will be justification for his slaughter.

These are their strategies: 

Edwyn merely needs to survive until Lord Walder dies, and from there he can be rid of Black Walder, Lothar, or any other rivals or inconvenient relatives he believes he has.

Black Walder needs to get rid of Edwyn before Lord Walder dies, or at least before Edwyn can take Black Walder out of the picture, and then expose Walda as illegitimate to give himself the seat, after which he can toss out or turn in any inconvenient or unwanted relations.

Lothar has a trickier path. He needs to survive the first battle between Edwyn and Black Walder without being tossed out or hung, and then turn them and perhaps some other sons of Lord Frey in as the plotters of the Red Wedding to be hung or sent to the Wall to clear the line of succession using whatever support he's mustered to surpass the authority of Black Walder and Edwyn. Off the top of my head, I think his best option is (if he can't take the seat himself) clear things so that he can take the position of Lord Protector of the Twins over a young male Frey, and then wed one of his four daughters to that Frey. I also put my money on Lothar being the one who wins over Bastard Walder in the end due to Lothar being far more intelligent than his grand nephews.

Ultimately, I don't think the line of succession will be tossed out the window too horribly, and even if Lothar takes the Twins, he may very well lose them if the North marches South again, but frankly, I'm putting my bet on Black Walder besting Edwyn, but Lothar sweeping in on Black Walder.

You want the Freys to face justice? Well here it is. The Freys that took part in the Red Wedding are either in Riverrun, where the BWB will come knocking; in Darry, where winter could end them (as well as a Darry-Frey feud as indicated by the Elder Brother); in the North, where those still not baked into pies face the wrath of Stannis; and the rest will be casualties in the threeway war between Lothar, Edwyn, and Black Walder. Or, worse, they'll be forced out from the Twins into the hands of the BWB to the South or the Reeds in the North. This will leave a very very weak House Frey standing if/when Stannis marches south after taking back the north.

* Qarth really doesn't matter after ACOK in any visible way.
* It serves as a lazy layover for Dany to get books until she bumbles into the Houses of the Undying and Drogon has a BBQ.
* You can't have her hang around half topless not doing much in the show for 5 to 7 episodes. 
* The show needs an easy to digest character progression each season.
 
My takeaway from Dany in the show's version of Qarth is:

* She'll learn very directly to trust no one. Qarth itself came across as salvation, and was ready to hang her out to dry in return. Then Xaro stepped forward the same, only to betray her and use her as a means to an end--exactly what only moments before she lamented to Xaro that the Silk King wanted her for.
* She'll learn how perilous her position really is. She knows from this season already from the death of her blood rider at the hand of a khalasar, so she's cut off from the Dothraki. She's now cut off from the Qartheen, leaving her only friends as Jorah, the survivors of the lamb people and her own khalasar, and theoretically… Illyrio.
* She will have to man up and deal with Pree and the Warlocks directly. Aside from ordering the death of the witch and walking into the flames last year, everything show Dany has done has been purely reactionary. Even the flame walk--to non book people--will read as going off to join Drogo in death. Now, we'll see Dany begin her role as not just mother of dragons but as bad ass, assertive conqueror. 
* This will open the doors in even better and logical fashion for a dockside rescue by a fat mercenary and an old swordsman, at the docks, especially when they say Illyrio sent them.

There are some theories that she will be sent to kill Tommen or Cersei ... but I have a different theory. (and I think the rule about not being able to kill those whose name you know is extremely strict, ruling them out).

I think she may very well be sent as an assassin, but the target will be Qyburn. As we see at the end of ADWD and all throughout AFFC when we hear rumors of experimentation ... Qyburn seems to be hellbent on discovering a way to cheat death. This obviously doesn't sit well with the Faceless Men seeing as how they revere the concept of death, and the resurrecting of the Mountain (assuming it is the Mountain) as a tool for the Queen to cheat death was the signal for them to intervene.

Since Arya never met or knew Qyburn this also fits the ""you cannot kill those you know"" rule. Also, with her experience warging into cats along with her past involving chasing cats throughout the dungeons - which is where Qyburn is conducting his 'experiments' - it seems the perfect job for Arya because of how storied the labyrinth of the dungeons are (whereas another FM could get lost, a dungeon-cat would know where to find him, thus why Arya must be the one assigned to him).

What happens afterwards is beyond me, I could theorize a thousand different scenarios... but it just feels right: Qyburn has become a clear mortal enemy of the FM, and Arya has to find a way back to Westeros.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,True,,,True,t3_t6vhp,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/t6vhp/aryas_future_spoilers_all/,

We are starting a series of debates about ASOIAF. You can view the [central hub](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1dbe5l/spoilers_all_asoiaf_debate_series_central_hub/) to see the debate format and rules. This thread is for determining the debate topics.

###**THE VOTES DO NOT MATTER IN THIS THREAD**

The votes will matter in the Part 2 thread tomorrow. The **five** topmost voted topics in the thread tomorrow will be our first five topics to debate. The order in which the topics will be debated will be determined separately by me.

We are looking for topics that can sustain a lengthy debate and ones that obviously aren't clear cut. The topics may be reworded, and similar topics may be combined into one. These topics need to be something that have an affirmative and negative position in order for a structured debate to work. For example ""Who is the most evil character?"" wouldn't really work as a topic since there aren't two defined sides to take. A possible rephrasing is: ""Ramsay Bolton is the most evil character. Agree or Disagree?""... or ""Ramsay Bolton is more evil than Gregor Clegane. Agree or Disagree?"". Both of those rephrased topics have two defined sides to argue.

Also try to keep the topics well-defined and not overly subjective. For example ""Stannis is the best character. Agree or Disagree?"" is quite vague and hard to debate as a result. A possible rephrasing is ""Of the remaining living characters, Stannis would make the best ruler of Westeros.

Of course in aDwD Strong Belwas gorges himself on the poisoned honeyed locusts and Dany is turned off by this and declines Hizdahr's offer to eat any.  Strong Belwas eats so many that Dany wouldn't have gotten any leftovers anyhow.  So in a sense he saved her from a poisoner, as predicted.

I love GRRM's small foreshadowing like this (even if changed in editing).  This quote by Dany is similar, and her attempted poisoning two books later is fulfilled.    

On the foreshadowing note, I've seen so many references to Freys and ""boiling"" in the reread that I'm convinced they will end by the Children of the Forest calling down smoldering water on the Twins, boiling all the Freys inside :)  Too soon to tell on that one though.

&gt;Cersei: ""When will I wed the prince?""
&gt;Maggy: ""Never. You will wed the king.""
&gt;Cersei: ""I will be queen, though?""
&gt;Maggy: ""Aye. Queen you shall be... until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear.""

First, let's think about what Cersei really holds dear. I personally think she only loves Jaime and power; her children are only really avenues to those two things.

Now, let's think about the younger, more beautiful queens -

* Margaery Tyrell (Companion queen)
* Daenerys Targaryen (Queen of Meereen and of the Dragons)
* Sansa Stark (Queen in the North)
* Princess Arianne Martell (throwing this in as a wild-card; should Dorne ever raise its banners against KL with Aegon, Doran Martell will presumably style himself as King of Dorne - he is not a man of well health, and Arianne is next in line. She has already tried to spirit away Myrcella)

I'm finding this one a little difficult to pin down, even in speculation. The most likely candidate I can think is Sansa; however, I don't think she'll ever accrue enough swords to march against the Baratheons/Lannisters and rob Cersei of her power.

The second prophecy however, is much more interesting.

&gt;Cersei: ""Will the king and I have children?""
&gt;Maggy: ""Oh, aye. Six-and-ten for him, and three for you. Gold shall be their crowns and gold their shrouds, and when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.""	

I'm a firm subscriber to the opinion that the *valonqar* isn't a Baratheon or a Lannister. Tyrion is too far away, not to mention the most obvious choice for the *valonqar*, and I believe GRRM is setting up a death scene where Jaime and Cersei die together, or at least Jaime kills himself out of grief. Note how Maggy doesn't say ""**your** *valonqar*"" - she just mentions a younger brother.

Let's review a list of male youngest brothers from houses she has made enemies of:

* Rickon Stark
* Stannis Baratheon
* Osney Kettleblack
* Aegon Targaryen/Blackfyre
* Theon Greyjoy
* Edmure Tully
* Sandor Clegane

However, I still believe there's the possibility of Tommen being the *valonqar*. Cersei arrives to him after the walk of shame in hysterical tears, noticeably more subdued and quiet after the ordeal. Cersei's tears have drowned her. Now all it takes is years of repression to come undone within Tommen, and for him to realise his power and really make Cersei suffer for it. He won't physically choke her to death - he'll do it through sadistic abuse of power.

After-note: I'm seeing a lot of parallels between Tommen and the Roman emperor Nero. Nero was a quiet, physically meek boy who preferred poetry and playing with animals, until he was suddenly thrust into power after his uncle was poisoned. He acted as a conduit of power for others, chiefly his tutors and his mother. His mother was an incestuous she-beast bent on ruling the realm in all but name, and manipulated Nero by sleeping with him. 
Suddenly, he realised the true extent of his powers, and began acting like an insane tyrant, severing his mother from all power in the process. Distraught at this loss, she soon began pushing for her stepson to become Emperor. Nero responded by moving her away and torturing her, eventually sending guards to stab her to death.

I hope this is where GRRM is going with this. I'd hate to see Tommen become little more than throne fodder, especially now that he is standing up for himself somewhat more.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,,True,t3_yv9dc,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/yv9dc/spoiler_all_lets_discuss_another_looked_over/,

Initially, I did not think much of this line on my first reading. I thought it was just a cruel and callous reminder to Ramsay to be as successful in retrieving his bride as Roose had been in his turncloack endeavors. On my most recent re-reading of ADWD however, I realized that before this Ramsay had little to no idea what the circumstances of his birth were. Presumably, the miller's wife did not tell Ramsay that his father, the Lord of the Dreadfort, hanged her husband and raped her to conceive him because she feared repercussion. It is known for having a ""quiet land, a quiet people."" Roose also demanded that she never tell Ramsay who his father is, so it stands to reason up to this point that Ramsay does not know the circumstances of his conception. 

We know the Ramsay does not take accepting his bastardy well. Anyone who presumes to call him ""Snow"" or even worse call him a bastard will most likely be at the business end of his flaying knife. We also know that Ramsay possess many of the same psychopathic tendencies as his father without the leechings to clear out the ""bad blood."" One of his favorite sports is hunting whores, which he then rapes, kills and then flays if they provide him good sport or rapes and flays them alive. He thinks of them as nothing more than playthings, sexual and sadistic objects for his amusement.

Suddenly, this myth he has constructed of his conception comes crashing down. Roose has revealed that he is the result of a rape. He is already ashamed to be a bastard but the bastard of a rape is something else entire. His mother was nothing more to his father than Kyra or any of the other women Ramsay has hunted, raped and flayed. An object. So what does that make him? Being a bastard left him without a name, being the bastard of rape leaves him with nothing. And with Fat Walda preparing to give Roose a proper son (as opposed to Domeric who was likely poisoned by Ramsay), Ramsay's world is shattered.

We have seen the downfall of many families in ASoIaF. Some like the Starks were destroyed because of their attachment, love and caring for one another. Eddard Stark lost his head not because he was unwilling to forsake his honor, but because mercy he had extended to Queen Cersei and the love for his children imprisoned by the Lannisters. Catelyn's death at the Red Wedding was in part due to her love too for Arya and Sansa; by releasing the Kingslayer, she turned Rickard Karstark against Robb and forced his hand to execute him. In turn, this drove Robb back into the clutches of the Freys where he was murdered. 

Other families such as the Lannisters have been destroyed by the animosity between each other. Yes, their willingness to destroy their enemies by any means makes them formidable but it also makes them resent one another. Tywin's treatment of Tyrion resulted in his own demise, Cersei's downfall is in part due to her paranoia of Tyrion and  Jaime has realized the manipulation of his sister and leaves her to her fate in KL. A convincing prediction I read about TWOW posits that Freys may soon join the Lannisters in the collapse-from-within team, as Walder Frey will likely die of old age in the next book, leaving his many children to fight among themselves for the Lordship of Riverrun. 

Where do the Boltons fall then? Given the last conversation between Roose and Ramsay, I think we're seeing the beginning of the downfall of House Bolton. So far, Roose's plans have been well-implemented: say what you want about the Red Wedding, but it was damn effective in the short-term at subduing the Northmen. Likewise sending the Freys and the Manderlys out into the blizzard to engage Stannis might seem foolhardy but it empties space in Winterfell. Dead men don't eat up the winter stores. 

However one great hole in his plan is Ramsay. In contrast to Roose's subtle cunning and intrigue, Ramsay is a sadistic (although deviously clever) maniac and his ""games"" are not subtle in the least. Every Northman knows of Lady Hornwood and Ramsay's ""hunts."" 

The downfall of Bolton then will be when Ramsay decides its no longer prudent to keep his father alive. Revealing the truth of Ramsay's birth only shows how little regard Roose has for his son and Ramsay won't forget that. His shame of being a bastard will compound with being the product of rape, no better than any of the possible bastards he could have sired on the women he hunted had he not flayed them. If the Freys are defeated in the Battle of the Ice as the evidence seems to point towards, then Ramsay will also no longer require the alliance to the Freys. He'll eliminate his father out of spite and aggression, then dispose of Fat Walda so that he alone rules in the North. Of course then it is only a matter of time until the North comes for Ramsay.

**TL;DR**: Ramsay will be responsible for Roose's demise because he now knows the truth of his conception and Fat Walda is prepared to give Roose a proper heir.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1370806601.0,,DayneOfStarfall,True,t3_1fzw7w,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fzw7w/spoilers_all_the_rue_of_roose_bolton/,

Other threads have compelling evidence on the matter: the spearwives' denial of the murders, Theon skipping periods of time in his head (sitting down for breakfast, getting up from lunch), and his encounter with a mysterious hooded figure who others have speculated could be a Tyler Durden-esque figment of his imagination.

**TIMELINE:** Reek 2, aka Ramsay, is brought to Winterfell by Rodrik prior to Theon's capture of it ACOK. Reek 3, aka Theon, appears in ADWD and returns to Winterfell with Ramsay and Roose.

In ACOK, after Theon comes up empty-handed on a hunt for Bran and Rickon, he takes Reek's suggestion to kill and flay the miller's boys in their place. After that, the men he went hunting with start showing up dead.

&gt;Outside his door, Reek waited with Urzen and Kromm. Theon fell in with them. These days, he took guards with him everywhere he went, even to the privy. Winterfell wanted him dead. The very night they had returned from Acorn Water, Gelmarr the Grim had tumbled down some steps and broken his back. The next day, Aggar turned up with his throat slit ear to ear. Gynir Rednose became so wary that he shunned wine, took to sleeping in byrnie, coif, and helm, and adopted the noisiest dog in the kennels to give him warning should anyone try to steal up on his sleeping place. All the same, one morning the castle woke to the sound of the little dog barking wildly. They found the pup racing around the well, and Rednose floating in it, drowned.

&gt;He could not let the killings go unpunished. Farlen was as likely a suspect as any, so Theon sat in judgment, called him guilty, and condemned him to death. Even that went sour. As he knelt to the block, the kennelmaster said, “M’lord Eddard always did his own killings.” Theon had to take the axe himself or look a weakling. His hands were sweating, so the shaft twisted in his grip as he swung and the first blow landed between Farlen’s shoulders. It took three more cuts to hack through all that bone and muscle and sever the head from the body, and afterward he was sick, remembering all the times they’d sat over a cup of mead talking of hounds and hunting. ***I had no choice***, he wanted to scream at the corpse. ***The ironborn can’t keep secrets, they had to die, and someone had to take the blame for it.*** He only wished he had killed him cleaner. Ned Stark had never needed more than a single blow to take a man’s head.

I didn't realize this until today: he had his men killed so they would not speak. Wex was spared, as Theon's squire and being, well, mute, but the others couldn't keep secrets and Farlen was the scapegoat. But who did the killing?

&gt;“Gone, has she?” Reek was at his elbow.

&gt;Theon had not heard him approach, nor smelled him either. He could not think of anyone he wanted to see less. It made him uneasy to see the man walking around breathing, with what he knew. ***I should have had him killed after he did the others, he reflected***, but the notion made him nervous. Unlikely as it seemed, Reek could read and write, and he was possessed of enough base cunning to have hidden an account of what they’d done.

Quite interesting. 'Twas Reek 2's hand that held the blade, and likely hatched the plot as well.  The loose end about a written account is unimportant in my opinion as Ramsay would destroy anything that might challenge his legitimacy as Lord.

Skip ahead to ADWD. Men are turning up dead in Winterfell. 

&gt;The next morning Ser Aenys Frey’s grizzled squire was found naked and dead of exposure in the
old castle lichyard, his face so obscured by hoarfrost that he appeared to be wearing a mask. Ser Aenys
put it forth that the man had drunk too much and gotten lost in the storm, though no one could explain
why he had taken off his clothes to go outside. *Another drunkard*, Theon thought. **Wine could drown a
host of suspicions.**

(the first 'accident' was a drunkard as well)

Reek 3 is suspected, but Roose finds him too weak and subservient to Ramsay to have committed the murders. Shortly before he's questioned, he meets a strange figure walking outside.

&gt;Farther on, he came upon a man striding in the opposite direction, a hooded cloak flapping
behind him. When they found themselves face-to-face their eyes met briefly. The man put a hand on his
dagger. “Theon Turncloak. Theon Kinslayer.”

&gt;“I’m not. I never … I was ironborn.”

&gt;“False is all you were. How is it you still breathe?”

&gt;“The gods are not done with me,” Theon answered, wondering if this could be the killer, the
night walker who had stuffed Yellow Dick’s cock into his mouth and pushed Roger Ryswell’s groom off
the battlements. Oddly, he was not afraid. He pulled the glove from his left hand. “Lord Ramsay is not
done with me.”

&gt;The man looked, and laughed. “I leave you to him, then.”

Very odd. Few men recognize him at first, though this figure may have seen him around beforehand. I take the interpretation that he's coming across himself, his inner Theon who still nurses hatred and vengeance--but Reek says that Ramsay is not done with him, and the figure lets him go.

Two paragraphs later:

&gt;He was trapped here, with the ghosts. The old ghosts from the crypts and the younger ones that
he had made himself, Mikken and Farlen, Gynir Rednose, Aggar, Gelmarr the Grim, the miller’s wife
from Acorn Water and her two young sons, and all the rest. My work. My ghosts. They are all here, and
they are angry. He thought of the crypts and those missing swords.

Gynir, Aggar, and Gelmarr were the men Reek 2 killed. I don't think it's coincidence that Reek did the deed the first time and Reek is the prime suspect again. I'm trying desperately to connect the victims (a man-at-arms of Roger Ryswell, a squire of Aenys Frey, both drunkards, a crossbowman of the Flints, all three suspected accidents, and Little Walder) but that may not bear fruit. All in all, I think the evidence is quite compelling.

Lastly: The chapter is called ""A Ghost in Winterfell"". He skips from breakfast to lunch:

&gt;As the garrison broke its fast that morning on stale bread fried in bacon grease (the lords and
knights ate the bacon), the talk along the benches was of little but the corpse.
“Stannis has friends inside the castle,” Theon heard one serjeant mutter. He was an old Tallhart
man, three trees sewn on his ragged surcoat. The watch had just changed. Men were coming in from the
cold, stomping their feet to knock the snow off their boots and breeches as the midday meal was
served—blood sausage, leeks, and brown bread still warm from the ovens.

The spearwives admit to killing Yellow Dick but deny a role in Little Walder's death. Theon thinks they've done the other murders as well but there's no confession to that from them which leaves the question open.

For me it is the in ASOS when Tyrion kills Tywin. So much happens in this chapter: we find Shae in Tywin's bed. Did Tywin give Shae to Tyrion (through Bronn) to keep an eye on his son?

We find Tywin on the toilet with a really bad case. Did Oberyn poison him over diner? He always said he wanted revenge not only on the Mountain, but the man who gave the order.
Would Tyrion had killed Tywin if he gave him Casterly Rock? He should have just given him his birthright...

Did Varys knowingly set Tyrion loose on Tywin knowing Tyrion would kill him? His killing Kevan certainly makes it seem that way. To sew chaos in King's Landing. 

But nothing confuses me more than the interaction between Jaime and Tyrion. Why did Tyrion lie about killing Joffrey? But in this same sequence Tyrion tells Jaime about Cersei and Lancel. Jaime was always faithful to Cersei but she wasn't faithful. This sets in motion Jaime's heroics with Brienne I suppose.

They say Robb Stark won every battle but lost the war. This chapter really shows that the Lannisters won the war but lost the realm.

If Jon Snow was still a bastard, naming him after Jon Connington would have the same problems as naming him after Jon Arryn.

Fellow Crows:

After consulting with the community we maesters have decided to implement the following policy effective immediately: from now on any sexist or misogynistic post **or** comment directed at any of the female characters in the ASOIAF universe will be removed. Violators of this new rule shall receive one and **only one** warning before being banned. Please note that due to our close working relationship with the moderators at /r/gameofthrones anyone banned here will likely be banned there as well.

Before anyone thinks otherwise let me be clear: **this rule only applies to the fictional characters of the ASOIAF series**. Sexist and/or misogynistic comments aimed at other crows (i.e. redditors) are obviously still acceptable. Unlike the characters Catelyn, Sansa, and Brienne real people can defend themselves. Since **fictional** characters such as Cersei and Melissandre obviously cannot fight back it is left to us, the moderators, to do it for them.

A sexist and/or misogynistic comment shall be defined as follows:

&gt;Any post or comment that demeans, criticizes, objectifies, or otherwise insults or belittles any female character in the ASOIAF series of novels and the television show, novellas, or any other medium based in the world of Westeros.

In order to help us maesters more easily enforce this new policy we have compiled a short list of adjectives and obscenities that, when directed toward female characters of ASOIAF, will result in removal and possibly a ban. **This list is not yet complete. Please feel free to suggest other terms we should add to it in the comments of this post.**

* annoying

* attractive

* bitch

* childish

* evil

* hot

* idiot

* incompetent

* mean

* moron

* prostitute

* sexy

* stupid

* ugly

* whiny

* whore

This list is **not** all encompassing and is meant only to give a general framework for what is unacceptable. We maesters retain the right to remove any post or comment that violates the spirit of this new rule at our sole discretion.

I think that we can all agree that there is no place for any form of sexism or misogyny on the Wall. The insults directed toward characters such as Cersei, Melisandre, or Mirri Maz Duur ends today and is likely well overdue. Having to live in George RR Martin's world is hard enough. These characters should not also have to suffer insult and injury from us fans of Martin's work, too.

We maesters thank you in advance for your compliance with this new policy and appreciate the Rangers who utilize the report button to notify us of any violators.

Your humble servants,

The maesters of /r/asoiaf

&gt; On the crown of the hill four-and-forty monstrous stone ribs rose from the earth like the trunks of great pale trees.

*****

&gt; From here he ruled both stone and salt, wearing robes of woven seaweed and a tall pale crown made from Nagga's teeth.

Pale trunks of trees are weirwood trunks. They have turned to stone like the weirwood in the castle Raventree of House Blackwood.

&gt; ""For a thousand years it has not shown a leaf. In another thousand it will have turned to stone, the maesters say. Weirwoods never rot.""

We have other mentions of groves of weirwoods on hills.

After Bran climbs the hill to reach the cave of COTF he notes

&gt; The world was black soil and white wood. The heart tree at Winterfell had roots as thick around as a giant's legs, but these were even thicker. And Bran had never seen so many of them. There must be a whole grove of weirwoods growing up above us.

Arya on the hill named High Heart,

&gt; The next day they rode to a place called High Heart, a hill so lofty that from atop it Arya felt as though she could see half the world. Around its brow stood a ring of huge pale stumps, all that remained of a circle of once-mighty weirwoods. Arya and Gendry walked around the hill to count them. There were thirty-one, some so wide that she could have used them for a bed.

Tom and the Ghost point out that magic still lingers here. Victarion felt the magic of Nagga when he arrives. Admittedly it could just be religious fervour.

There are members of House Stonetree on the island. It also provides an interesting parallel to Bloodraven. Nagga was trees becoming a dragon while Bloodraven was a dragon who became trees.

The COTF lived near weirwood groves. They called down the hammer of the waters in an attempt to shatter the neck to stop the invasion of First Men from the Children's Tower at Moat Cailin. Nagga supposedly drowned whole islands in wrath. We know that COTF shattered the Arm of Dorne by drowning it. This hammer of waters  was called down from the hill that later became Nagga. The COTF connection ties in with the mythical Naggas of Asia that protect nature. The COTF went to war to stop the deforestation committed by FM.

The slaying of Nagga by the Grey King represents the triumph of the First Men over the COTF that lived in the grove. In time, the tale became the myth we hear today.

*****
I am fairly confident of the theory above. This is a continuation of the theory of Nagga being a COTF colony in a grove. Of course a lot of it is speculation without proof. So it could be considered crackpot.

Black Harren is one of my favourite Kings of the past. He built Harrenhal. However Ironborn seldom build so far from the sea. The location of Harrenhal is extremely strange as it sits on the banks of God's Eye. The castle itself is a monstrous folly that took fourty long years to build. History tells us that Harren was an arrogant man. But, why make a castle that you won't live long in? There is also a small matter of the curse. So i present this theory.

Harren visited Nagga and realized that the bones are just stone weirwoods. Harren's grandfather had conquered Raventree hall already and Harren made the connection. Perhaps he slept there and had prophetic dreams like Jaime and The Ghost of High Heart about something that lead him to construct Harrenhal. He adopted the Faith of Old Gods. Why else would a Drowned God worshipper have a weirwood in his castle? He however kept the thrall and saltwife  aspects of his Ironborn  culture and continued raiding the nearby kingdoms. The Isle of Faces is an island in the God's Eye lake. Here the pact of friendship was signed between the first men and COTF. There is a grove of living weirwood trees protected by Green Men. As Howland Reed has visited them, we know they exist. Perhaps Harren wanted to make his own Grey Hall like the Grey King. However the green Men refused permission to build the castle at Isle of Faces. So, Harrenhal was built at it's present location.

Perhaps it could even be with the help of Green Men. Cat says that Harren cut down weirwoods for beams. There are many followers of First Men who use weirwood trees to create tools. Ygritte has weirwood bow. Bloodraven had a similar bow. A man possibly Brandon Snow in Bran's vision was making weirwood arrows. A raider had a weirwood spear. So using weirwood materials is not immoral. Weirwood beams were used in construction of Harrenhal.

The vision of Harren could be  a vision of an invasion. Harren must have interpretated as an Others' invasion when it was in fact a vision of Aegon invading. His brother was packed off to the NW and the brother kept his vows even when Harren died.  Harren was also extremely arrogant when dealing with Aegon. He proclaimed that [stone does not burn](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6592/) Such arrogance in face of 8000 men and Balerion seems like a folly. Perhaps he believed that the Green Men would protect him as he had a destiny to fight the invasion of Others. Of course they didn't and Harren burnt. Aegon wrote the history we read about. He  promptly demonized Argilac as the Arrogant and showed himself as a good guy. Perhaps he never knew about Harren's plans or he simply ignored them. Harren was Ironborn and hence unpopular in Riverlands. The smallfolk quickly picked up the tale.

Ofcourse, Harrenhal could just be a metaphor for the Seven Kingdoms and I am looking too much into it.

1368136973.0,189,self.asoiaf,1e12ib,(Spoiler All) Speculation for Season 4: the show could be catching up with GRRM faster than you think,DirtyMerlin,242,53,196,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1e12ib/spoiler_all_speculation_for_season_4_the_show/,"Let me preface this by saying that I would like to see the show go for 10 seasons. However, David and D.B. have described their goal as an 80-hour series—only 8 seasons. If the ratings hold where they are or grow for the rest of the show’s run (unlikely, but possible), I imagine we could end up seeing 9-10 seasons. Television shows need to exhibit constant momentum to keep viewers interested, and while us here in r/ASOIAF may watch to whatever end, the show needs to hold onto casual viewers and non-book readers in order to survive and I imagine that 3 seasons of Dany in Meereen would tax even the most fervent “Danaerio” ‘shippers. So, right now I want to speculate how and why the show may be catching up with GRRM faster than we might expect if they hold to an 8 season goal.

We already know that seasons 3 and 4 correspond roughly to the first and second halves of ASOS. This season will end with the Red Wedding in episode 9 (“The Rains of Castamere”) and Dany’s conquest of Yunkai in ep. 10 (“Mhysa”). This puts us at around the 2/3rds mark the ASOS. Season 4 will be a barnburner, and probably make everyone forget about depressing the RW was as just about everything progresses happily (sorry, Ygritte): the Purple Wedding, the battle at the Wall and Stannis the Mannis saving the day, Jon becoming LC, the conquest of Meereen, Sansa’s escape and arrival in the Vale and Lysa’s flight out the Moon Door, the Red Viper v. the Mountain, and Tyrion’s escape and killing spree. The first appearance of Lady Stoneheart will be the cliffhanger for one of these two seasons, and, based on the ep. 10 title, there is a solid chance that it’s this one (easier than having UnCat and Beric around for one episode of next year after not seeing them all season).

Even all this isn’t enough to fill an entire season, however. The show has already taken significant liberties in showing Theon and Ramsay this early, and I imagine these will continue through the fourth season. The producers aren’t going to let us forget about Roose and the Freys or about the Ironborn for an entire season between the RW and season 5+, where a combined AFFC/ADWD timeline will finally appear in full. I have some thoughts as to what the show might do in regards to including book material past ASOS. I'll list them in short here and put the long text in the comments to facilitate easier commenting on specific elements:

1) Bran and Arya pushing on ahead 

2) Theon's around, so use him/Don't forget about the Boltons 

3) The Kingsmoot 

4) Intro to Dorne/Copious T&amp;A 

The Dorne addition might be a little more of a stretch, but I feel confident that Theon, Roose/Ramsay, Arya and Bran will push ahead into AFFC/ADWD by the end of season 4. If Theon’s story was going to go at the same pace, they wouldn’t have shown him for these two seasons. Arya and Bran just got unlucky with how their chapters were stacked in the book, but I just don’t think there’s any way that they each spend yet another year trudging through the woods. It’s simply a question of what works better for the new format based off where they divided ASOS. 

If some or all of these changes are made, I believe that we could be in for AFFC/ADWD to be covered in just one season. The pieces in this great cyvasse game would be all set up already, and so everything can move ahead smoothly. AFFC/ADWD both feature really long segments of characters travelling, and I think Dan and D.B. would be wise to speed those parts up by placing them right before the season 4/5 break. Sam takes an entire book to get to Oldtown, Vic and Tyrion take more than that to get to Meereen, Brienne goes nowhere in particular. Many of the character arcs work better over one season as well: Brienne would have more than enough time to follow a few dead ends, meet the BWB and UnCat, and find Jaime in ten episodes; Jon Connington and Aegon don’t need more than a season to be introduced and get to Westeros; and basically everything after Tyrion leaves the Golden Company can be cut and changed to “largely uneventful traveling to Meereen"" (I highly doubt pig jousting will come into play). Cersei’s growing madness and downfall would be more effective and Jon’s tenure as LC and his subsequent betrayal would be more shocking in just one season as well. As for most of the new POVs introduced post-ASOS, I think we have to give them less weight that the ones around from the beginning. Aeron is unlikely to have a significant contribution to the show and Areo or Arys are unlikely to be anything more than side characters. Most of the newer ones were introduced to observe anyway, not to do. 

My big concern with a one season-AFFC/ADWD is less that much will be excised and more that there is a lot of content in the forthcoming TWOW that probably need to be included at the close of the season. I imagine that a fair amount of the start of TWOW will have to be placed at the conclusion of the season covering ADWD because of GRRM skewing the timeline towards the end (some of the pre-released chapters occur before the end of ADWD). When the AFFC characters rejoin ADWD at around the 2/3rds mark, the book slows down and you never hear from many important characters again (Davos, Bran) and so we don’t know what happens to them over the last 300 pages. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Battles of Winterfell and Meereen occurred at the climax of season 5 as well because they are the logical conclusion to many of the stories that started in AFFC. For budget reasons, I doubt HBO will fork over money for huge battles at the beginning of the season as well as at the end (assuming some serious shit goes down at the end of TWOW) and they simply work to keep the season a little more self-contained and set up everything for the even bigger finale that will start with TWOW. 

So, that leaves us with:

Season 4: final 3rd of ASOS and non-timeline essential parts of AFFC/ADWD

Season 5: the bulk of a combined AFFC/ADWD, plus some of the beginning of TWOW

Season 6-8: TWOW and ADOS

Please let me know what you think and if I’ve missed anything. This is all speculation. What should the show do? What shouldn’t they do? What will they do?

Sorry about the wall of text but I was bored at work and have wanted to post this here for a while.

1363275330.0,187,self.asoiaf,1aaenu,(Spoilers All) Theory on Rhaegar's Plans ,Book_1love,224,37,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1aaenu/spoilers_all_theory_on_rhaegars_plans/,"This is my first post, comments are very appreciated. 

I'd like to submit my theory on Rhaegar's plans and goals before he died on the Battle of the Trident.  

It appeared to me on my second reading of the books that Rhaegar was planning to depose his father (likely non-violently) and become king.

I thought this based on the following events: 

Rhaegar tells Jamie before he leaves for his final battle that he is going to make some changes to the way things are run when he returns.  As only the heir to the throne, he really has no right to decide how the kingdom is run without his father's approval, and it appears that Aerys was suspicious that Rhaegar was trying to usurp his power, which would make it unlikely for him to listen to any suggestions Rhaegar may have given him.

Rhaegar's wife Elia and their children are effectively acting as Arey's hostages at this point.  He keeps them close by him to ensure Rhaegar's loyalty.  Rhaegar's response to this is to find a new wife (Lyanna Stark) and hide her not only from her own family and former fiance, but also from his father and his army.

Rhaegar sets tells the most loyal members of the Kingsguard his plans, including his best friend Arthur Dayne, and has them guard his new wife (and possibly his child) so that if his father decides to have Ageon and Rhaenys killed, he will still have an heir and the crown will not pass to his little brother Viserys (Jaime Lannister and Barristan Selmy noticed that Viserys might be mad when he was a child, so its not unreasonable to think that Rhaegar noticed as well)

He takes the remaining members of the Kingsguard, aside from Jaime Lannister, the youngest, least experienced and least politically savvy of the Kingsguard, with him to battle Robert Baratheon.  He may have also told Barristan, Lewyn Martell and Jonothor Darry his plans, or maybe he didn't but hoped that removing them from the capital would allow for a smoother transition to power (in case they were not ready to support his claim).

I would also argue that Rhaegar  planned to stage a non-violent coup, as opposed to killing his father.  This is based on Rhaegar 's apparently sensitive warrior-poet personality, the cultural taboos against kinslaying, and the fact that once the Kingsguard was removed, Aerys had almost no powerful supporters due to his craziness (after alienating Tywin Lannister and exiling/murdering his other Hands) and wouldn't have been much of a threat (his current Hand Rossart, is clearly a lackey without the command of any troops of his own, besides the pyromancers, who are not warriors and could be easily subdued)

If Rhaegar had been able to end the rebellion, he would have been able to march back to King's Landing with the royal army at his command to take control.  Young Jaime favoured him and likely wouldn't have opposed him, and he could have bought the loyalty of the Gold Cloaks or threatened to crush them with his army.  He would have had the loyalty of his 1st wife's house (Dorne never deployed an army during the rebellion and was at full strength) and maybe would have tried to win Tywin back to his side (he could have offered to free Jaime from the Kingsguard, or offered to marry Cersei to Viserys).
He could have exiled his father to Dragonstone with a small contingent of guards and become a beloved and effective ruler, but of course all then ended the day Robert gave the Ruby Ford his name...

TL;DL: Rhaegar planned to depose his father and take over the Iron Throne himself before he was killed.

1370783261.0,184,self.asoiaf,1fz9nk,(Spoilers ALL) Lady Stoneheart and the Rape-Revenge story trope,Bookshelfstud,234,50,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fz9nk/spoilers_all_lady_stoneheart_and_the_raperevenge/,"There's this genre known as ""Rape and revenge"" stories (here's a [tvtropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAndRevenge) link for a fuller explanation and better examples). The general plot of each of them is that the main character, usually a woman, undergoes some sort of horrible trauma, whether violent beating or rape or *something.* The second act is usually her building her strength up and hardening as a person, and the third act is her glorious revenge. The Kill Bill movies are probably the most well-known homage to this trope. I hadn't thought about Stoneheart as ""Rape and revenge"" character until now, but it really does make sense in terms of turning that trope on its head in classic GRRM style. Here's what I mean:

The classic rape-revenge protagonist is usually sympathetic. I say usually; there have been some examples of the protagonist going just absolutely apeshit and doing things much worse than what was done to them. But the classic intent of this trope is to give the reader a cathartic experience - ""Yeah! Woohoo! The bad guys get it in the end!"" Given GRRM's propensity for just turning shit on its head left and right, it wouldn't surprise me if Stoneheart's catharsis becomes more and more dismaying to us. She already went to hang Brienne and Pod, something that, while definitely rationalize-able from her perspective, is worrying. 

And now, of course, Jaime and Brienne are both headed to LSH. This is probably what I'm most excited to see in TWOW, because I honestly can't figure out how this is going to play out. It's a puzzle, really; two POVs headed towards LSH. Does Brienne kill Jaime in trial by combat? Vice versa, perhaps? Does Brienne kill LSH, breaking her oaths for Jaime? WHO KNOWS. 

But LSH is definitely some sort of send-up of the rape-revenge trope. ",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,SeaworthOfRainwood,True,t3_1fz9nk,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fz9nk/spoilers_all_lady_stoneheart_and_the_raperevenge/,

But let's take a moment to consider the opposite approach.

**Are there any characters that you think, allowing for the difference in medium, or in the context of show-canon v. book-canon, have been handled more effectively than were their book counterparts? Any that you think were handled more effectively, period?**

My nominations:

* **Cersei** - book!Cersei is a more-or-less straight villain, and generally it works pretty well up until AFFC, where the whole reveal about the prophecy was, I think, meant to inspire some sympathy for her in a similar fashion to the reveal about Jaime's reasons for killing Aerys, but came too little and too late. Cersei is still an antagonist on the show, no doubt, but the most excessively evil things that she does in the book are generally transferred to Joff and season one does a lot of work in establishing sympathetic reasons for the failure of her marriage to Robert, and honestly? I prefer the more balanced, less idiotic Cersei. I think that Show!Cersei still retains the general 'feel' of book!Cersei while being a more realistic, well-rounded character and I think that this will make the AFFC reveal a lot more effective when they get there.
* **Shae** - More of a departure, but book!Shae was so obviously and transparently a gold-digger that she made Tyrion look like a complete idiot for not realizing it. I don't know how they're going to handle her eventual betrayal, but I think they have the potential to make it have more of a tragic impact, whereas in the book I was frustrated at Tyrion for not seeing that coming when he's such an otherwise intelligent and savvy character. 
* **Theon** - while I'm not the biggest fan of how they're managing the pacing on his storyline this season, I again think that the work that they've done with making him a more sympathetic character earlier on will benefit his ultimate ADWD storyline. I think that the showrunners did a good job with bringing his internal conflict to the forefront while still maintaining him as sort of a sad-sack douchebag. 

I suspect that many of you will disagree with me, but GRRM is no more an infallible writer than are the people writing the show.

This was the most demanding chapter on me as a reader so far in any book. Cersei has always been a character I've hated; there have been pitiful moments (her regret at having been born a woman in the patriarchal society of Westeros, for instance), but she's still been pretty easy to hate.

Until now. I don't know if it was the hugely unsubtle Christian imagery or just the abject shame as you gradually watched her spirit break throughout the walk, and finally covering herself when she'd vowed to herself that she wouldn't... It was like BAM! Right in the feelings.

I don't know what her future holds, and I really hope GRRM doesn't turn every character likable, but it was a real moment of empathy with a character who I have no time for, and a very impressive piece of writing.

&gt; A dark-eyed youth, pale and fierce, sliced three branches off the weirwood and shaped them into arrows.

From [a report](http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6592/) of GRRM's ""World of Ice and Fire"" reading:

&gt; Torrhen Stark had raised a large army (30,000) and had crossed the Neck. Aegon marched with an army half again that size. The Starks waited at Moat Cailin and took counsel. Torrhen's bastard brother, Brandon Snow, offered to sneak into the Targaryen camp and kill the three dragons. Instead, Torrhen sent three maesters to meet Aegon across the Trident. Torrhen would bend the knee and would be forever known as ""The King Who Knelt"".

No proof that Brandon Snow is the youth in Bran's vision, but definitely possible -- three weirwood arrows for three dragons. It's an interesting moment when the history of Westeros could have turned out very differently. If he succeeded, the Targaryens could've been defeated and Westeros would've remained 7 kingdoms. If he tried and failed (which I assume was the far more likely), the North would've been utterly devastated and House Stark likely extinguished (replaced by Boltons, like the Tyrells replaced the Gardeners?).

The trial takes place in Episode 6: A Golden Crown but for me, the whole Viserys angle was not what I was focusing on, I was more interested in the Vale. So I'm like half paying attention during the scene where Viserys tries to steal the dragon eggs and Mormont stops him. I heard the exchange between them and then stopped dead in my tracks and hit rewind. The exchange that caught my attention went something like this VT: ""Does honor not matter to you?"" JM: ""Honor is the only thing that matters to me."" VT: ""And yet here you stand..."" JM: ""**Here I Stand**"". Just thought is was pretty cool that they added in the Mormont words without actually giving them away in the series. It's one of those little things that only readers would know.

1. It was founded by escaped Valyrian slaves, and was a secret city until the Doom of Valyria.    
2. Slavery is forbidden in Braavos, and they imposed a slavery ban in nearby Pentos as part of war reparations.    
3. The Faceless Men are based in Braavos, and have a history intertwined with Valyrian slaves.    
4. The Iron Bank of Braavos is referred to as the most powerful bank in the free cities. It considers political coup a successful debt collection technique.    
5. The Iron Bank was a major creditor to Westeros under Robert Baratheon.    
6. Petyr Baelish is of Braavosi descent.    
7. Tyrion's former wife is possibly a whore in Braavos.
8. The Sealord of Braavos was the Red Viper's witness on Willem Darry's Dorne-Targaryen marriage contract, a plot guaranteed to cause war if the Baratheons (or Lannisters) discovered it.
9. Braavos has a powerful navy, and the Arsenal of Braavos is reputed to be able to construct a galley in a day.

In response, the Boltons flee south to escape their wrath, and the Freys amass a goddamn MASSIVE army to fight back against them.

This seems to contrast the idea we have of Stannis(I admit show Stannis has skewed my take on him).  The 'myth' of Stannis is that he doesn't desire power but is simply doing what he feels is his duty, by law.  How does that myth hold up given his clear desire to have been named hand?

This theory recently came to mind in a thread on this subreddit about Darkstar possibly being Aegon. What if Darkstar was Rhaegar's son but not with Ellia; what if Lyanna had twins.

I believe that R+L=J like a lot of people. Instead of one son though what would the outcome be if Lyanna had twins? Ned finds his sister in a bed of blood with one child bearing dark hair and dark eyes like that of a Northerner, and another child that took more after his father with dark purple eyes and silver hair. Promising to his sister to protect her children from Robert's fury, Ned takes the child with the Targaryen features to the only place in the realm he might fit in: Starfall to be raised as a Dayne. He was taken in by Ashara Dayne(because Arthur was so close to Rhaegar, or since Eddard was an aquaintaince of Ashara's) who faked her death to raise Darkstar(named Gerold Dwayne after the two Kings guard members that died ""protecting"" him) in hiding and prevent people from asking questions. She raised the child as her own to replace the child she lost. 

Eddard then takes the child with the dark features North with him forsaking his own honor for his sister and naming him his bastard( then naming him after either Jon Arryn or Conning ton.)

This theory would also work with the title; Jon Snow as the calm, honorable, Northerner as Ice and Darkstar representing the violent, angry Southerner as Fire in A Song of Ice and Fire.

 If this some how turned out to be true I could image some epic showdown between these two bad asses of Westeros or maybe teaming up.

The young prince is about the right age and has Targaryen features, so his claim is generally accepted by those who hear it.

There's a reader-theory, though, that Aegon is actually a Blackfyre heir (and probably Illyrio's son) and not a Targaryen.  Some evidence for this theory:

* The Golden Company, a mercenary group founded by Blackfyre survivors with the express purpose of eventually seating a Blackfyre on the Iron Throne, is supporting Aegon's claim.
* Although we're told that the Blackfyre's ""male line"" has died out, the odd specificity of this statement combined with the physical description of Illyrio's late wife seems to imply that the female line survived.
* The backstory of Robert's Rebellion suggests that Varys was feeding King Aerys's paranoia by claiming that Prince Rhaegar was attempting to organize lords to help depose him.  This probably played a role in ensuring a violent transition of power, eventually eliminating (almost) the Targaryen line.  If Varys is a Targ loyalist, this seems like a pretty bad move; as a Blackfyre supporter, though, his actions make perfect sense.

None of that is new, but yesterday I was rereading *A Feast for Crows* and found a passage that seems to foreshadow Aegon's appearance in *ADwD*, specifically supporting the Blackfyre angle.  In Brienne 7, Septon Meribald explains the history of ""The Old Inn:""

&gt; ""...He forged a new sign for the yard, a three-headed dragon of black iron that he hung from a wooden post.  The beast was so big it had to be made in a dozen pieces, joined with rope and wire.  When the wind blew it would clank and clatter, so the inn became known far and wide as the Clanking Dragon.""  
""Is the dragon sign still there?"" asked Podrick.  
""No,"" said Septon Meribald.  ""When the smith's son was an old man, a bastard son of the fourth Aegon rose up in rebellion against his trueborn brother and took for his sigil a black dragon.  These lands belonged to Lord Darry then, and his lordship was fiercely loyal to the king.  The sign of the black iron dragon made him wroth, so he cut down the post, hacked the sign to pieces, and cast them into the river.  One of the dragon's heads washed up on the Quiet Isle many years later, though by that time it was red with rust.""

Targaryens use a red dragon as their sigil; a black dragon is the sigil of house Blackfyre.  After their defeat, the Blackfyres were diminished in number and forced across the narrow sea (""[he] hacked the [black dragon] to pieces, and cast them into the river"").  Could this passage foreshadow the reappearance of a Blackfyre heir (""one of the dragon's heads"") on Westeros's Western shore, whom - given the amount of time since Blackfyres were defeated - everyone takes for a Targaryen instead (""by that time it was red with rust"")?",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,True,,,True,t3_p844r,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/p844r/adwd_spoilers_and_speculation_septon_meribald/,

A lot of people have been debating if they'll show the Beric's Kiss/Cat's resurrection and if they do how they will do it. I tend to be in the camp that they will do the revival. It occurred to me that Arya will (hopefully) be knocked unconscious at the end of episode 9. This sets it up perfectly for her to have a wolf dream during her unconsciousness. The wolf dream shows Nymeria pulling Cat out of the water and witnesses Beric's Kiss of Life onto Cat. And then the closing scene could be instead of watching Cat's eyes open, Arya's eyes opening revealing her to be alive. Yet still leaving a cliff hanger on Cat's resurrection. This makes the Stoneheart reveal (hopefully at the end of Season 4) not only make sense but much more powerful because it also affirms that Arya's wolf dreams are real.

No Patchface, no Butterbumps, very little Dontos, and probably no Moonboy for all I know.  That makes me wonder if everybody's favorite doomed fool Jinglebell is going to make an appearance at the Red Wedding, or if he's going to be written out as well. 

Why does it matter? Well, in the books it's sad when Catelyn kills Jinglebell, but I think the show's setting us up for a much more dramatic murder than that. I think Catelyn's going to kill Talisa instead of Jinglebell at the Red Wedding's climax.  

In the books, it's heavily implied that some of the Westerlings are conspiring with the Lannisters. But with the Westerlings written out of the show, who takes that place? I think there's some pretty [compelling evidence that Talisa is a Lannister spy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsTVnZm9hFg) If that's true, I think it would make a lot of dramatic sense for Catelyn to cut her throat instead of Jinglebell's.

He could only be Prince Maekar, the youngest of King Daeron's four sons. Prince Aerys was bookish and Prince Rhaegel was mad, meek, and sickly. Neither was like to cross half the realm to attend a tourney, but Maekar was said to be a redoubtable warrior in his own right, though ever in the shadow of his older brother.

+++Raymun Fossoway, *The Hedge Knight*

""Maekar's heir. Daeron, he's named, after the king. They call him Daeron the Drunken, though not in his father's hearing. The youngest boy was still with him as well. They left Summerhall together but never reached Ashford."" Raymun drank from his cup and set it aside. ""Poor Maekar."" ""Poor?"" said Dunk, startled. ""The king's son?"" ""The king's *fourth* son,"" said Raymun, ""not quite as bold as Prince Baelor, nor as clever as Prince Aerys, nor as gentle as Prince Rhaegel. And now he must suffer seeing his own sons overshadowed by his brother's. Daeron is a sot, Aerion is vain and cruel, the third son was so unpromising they gave him to the Citadel to make a maester of him, and the youngest-""

+++Egg, *The Hedge Knight*

""I never heard of a Prince Egg."" ""It's short for Aegon. My brother Aemon named me Egg. He's off at the Citadel now, learning to be a maester. And Daeron sometimes calls me Egg as well, and so do my sisters.""

+++Baelor Breakspear, *The Hedge Knight*

""My brother has a prickly nature, and he has placed all his best hopes on Aerion, since Daeron has been such a grave disappointment to him.""

+++Egg, *The Mystery Knight*

""Aemon and I used to fight the battle on Maester Melaquin's green table with painted soldiers and little banners.""

""Aemon and I used to pretend that our dragon eggs would be the ones to hatch. If they did, we could fly through the sky on dragonback, like the first Aegon and his sisters.""

+++Aemon, *A Game of Thrones*

""Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms...or the memory of a brother's smile?""

""We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love. That is our great glory, and our great tragedy.""

The old man laid a withered, spotted hand on his shoulder. ""It hurts, boy,"" he said softly. ""Oh, yes. Choosing...it has always hurt. And always will. I know."" [...] Maester Aemon sighed. ""Have you heard nothing I've told you, Jon? Do you think you are the first?"" He shook his ancient head, a gesture weary beyond words. ""Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows. Once when I was a boy, once in the fullness of my manhood, and once when I had grown old. By then my strength was fled, my eyes grown dim, yet that last choice was as cruel as the first. My ravens would bring the news from the south, words darker than their wings, the ruin of my House, the death of my kin, disgrace and desolation. Why could I have done, old, blind, frail? I was helpless as a sucking babe, yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brother's poor grandson, and *his* son, and even the little children..."" Jon was shocked to see the shine of tears in the old man's eyes. [...] The old man touched the maester's chain that hung loosely around his thin, fleshless neck. ""My father was Maekar, the First of his Name, and my brother Aegon reigned after him in my stead. My grandfather named me for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, who was his uncle, or his father, depending on which tale you believe. Aemon, he called me..."" [...] ""So you see, Jon, I *do* know...and knowing, I will not tell you *stay* or *go*. You must make that choice yourself, and live with it all the rest of your days. As I have."" His voice fell to a whisper. ""As I have...""

+++Jeor, *A Clash of Kings*

""Blind he may be, but Aemon knows what he's about. I pray the gods let us keep him another twenty years. Do you know that he might have been king? [...] His father's father was Daeron Targaryen, the Second of His Name, who brought Dorne into the realm. Part of the pact was that he wed a Dornish princess. She gave him four sons. Aemon's father Maekar was the youngest of those, and Aemon was *his* third son. Mind you, all this happened long before I was born, ancient as Smallwood would make me."" ""Maester Aemon was named for the Dragonknight."" ""So he was. Some say Prince Aemon was King Daeron's true father, not Aegon the Unworthy. Be that as it may, our Aemon lacked the Dragonknight's martial nature. He likes to say he had a slow sword but quick wits. Small wonder his grandfather packed him off to the Citadel. He was nine or ten, I believe...and ninth or tenth in the line of succession as well. [...] Aemon was at his books when the eldest of his uncles, the heir apparent, was slain in a tourney mishap. He left two sons, but they followed him to the grave not long after, during the Great Spring Sickness. King Daeron was also taken, so the crown passed to Daeron's second son, Aerys."" [...] ""How long ago was this?"" ""Eighty years or close enough,"" the Old Bear said, ""and no, I *still* hadn't been born, though Aemon had forged half a dozen links of his maester's chain by then. Aerys wed his own sister, as the Targaryens were wont to do, and reigned for ten or twelve years. Aemon took his vows and left the Citadel to serve at some lordling's court...until his royal uncle died without issue. The Iron Throne passed to the last of King Daeron's four sons. That was Maekar, Aemon's father. The new king summoned all his sons to court and would have made Aemon part of his councils, but he refused, saying that would usurp the place rightly belonging to the Grand Maester. Instead he served at the keep of his eldest brother, another Daeron. Well, that one died too, leaving only a feeble-witted daughter as heir. Some pox caught from a whore, I believe. The next brother was Aerion."" ""Aerion the Montrous?"" [...] ""The very one, though he named himself Aerion Brightflame. One night, in his cups, he drank a jar of wildfire, after telling his friends it would transform him into a dragon, but the gods were kind and it transformed him into a corpse. Not quite a year after, King Maekar died in battle against an outlaw lord."" [...] ""That was the year of the Great Council. The lords passed over Prince Aerion's infant son and Prince Daeron's daughter and gave the crown to Aegon."" ""Yes and no. First they offered it, quietly, to Aemon. And quietly he refused. The gods meant for him to serve, not to rule, he told them. He had sworn a vow and would not break it, though the High Septon himself offered to absolve him. Well, no sane man wanted any blood of Aerion's on the throne, and Daeron's girl was a lackwit besides being female, so they had no choice but to turn to Aemon's younger brother - Aegon, the Fifth of His Name. Aegon the Unlikely, they called him, born the fourth son of a fourth son. Aemon knew, and rightly, that if he remained at court those who disliked his brother's rule would seek to use him, so he came to the Wall. And here he has remained, while his brother and his brother's son and *his* son each reigned and died in turn, until Jaime Lannister put an end to the line of the Dragonkings.""

+++Jon, *A Clash of Kings*

Maester Aemon had counted more than a hundred name days, Jon knew. Frail, shrunken, wizened, and blind, it was hard to imagine him as a little boy no older than Arya.

+++Aemon, *A Storm of Swords*

""I am a maester chained and sworn. My order serves, Jon. We give counsel, not commands.""

+++Aemon, *A Dance with Dragons*

""Allow me to give my lord one last piece of counsel,"" the old man had said, ""the same counsel that I once gave my brother when we parted for the last time. He was three-and-thirty when the Great Council chose him to mount the Iron Throne. A man grown with sons of his own, yet in some ways still a boy. Egg had an innocence to him, a sweetness we all loved. *Kill the boy within you*, I told him the day I took the ship for the Wall. *It takes a man to rule. An Aegon, not an Egg. Kill the boy and let the man be born.*"" The old man felt Jon’s face. ""You are half the age that Egg was, and your own burden is a crueler one, I fear. You will have little joy of your command, but I think you have the strength in you to do the things that must be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy and let the man be born.""

+++Aemon, *A Feast for Crows*

""My own father raised the same objections when I chose a life of service,"" the old man said. ""It was his father who sent me to the Citadel. King Daeron had sired four sons, and three had sons of their own. *Too many dragons are as dangerous as too few*, I heard His Grace tell my lord father, the day they sent me off.""

""I was not born blind,"" he reminded them. ""When last I passed this way, I saw every rock and tree and whitecap, and watched the grey gulls flying in our wake. I was five-and-thirty and had been a maester of the chain for sixteen years. Egg wanted me to help him rule, but I knew my place was here. He sent me north aboard the *Golden Dragon*, and insisted that his friend Ser Duncan see me safe to Eastwatch. No recruit had arrived at the Wall with so much pomp since Nymeria sent the Watch six kings in golden fetters. Egg emptied out the dungeons too, so I would not need to say my vows alone. My honor guard, he called them. One was no less a man than Bryden Rivers. Later he was chosen lord commander."" ""Bloodraven?""

""Once I was as young as you."" That seemed to make him sad.

""The rain feels good against my face, Sam. It feels like tears. Let me stay a while longer, I pray you. It has been a long time since last I wept.""

Aemon's blind white eyes came open. ""Egg?"" he said, as the rain streamed down his cheeks. ""Egg, I dreamed that I was old.""

""It is not fear you hear,"" the old man told him. "" That is the sound of grief, and there is no potion for that. Let her tears run their course, Sam. You cannot stem the flow.""

""Egg? It's dark. Why is it so dark?"" *Because you're blind.* Aemon's wits were wandering more and more since they arrived at Braavos.

""Oldtown,"" Maester Aemon wheezed. ""Yes. I dreamt of Oldtown, Sam. I was young again and my brother Egg was with me, with that big knight he served. We were drinking in the old inn where they make the fearsomely strong cider.""

""When will I be stronger, Sam? Tell me that.""

""I shall not see Oldtown again. I know that now."" The old man tightened his grip on Sam's arm. ""I will be with my brothers soon. Some were bound to me by vows and some by blood, but they were all my brothers. And my father...he never thought the throne would pass to him, and yet it did. He used to say that was his punishment for the blow that slew his brother. I pray he found the peace in death that he never knew in life. The septons sing of sweet surcease, of laying down our burdens and voyaging to a far sweet land where we may laugh and love and feast until the end of days...but what if there is no land of light and honey, only cold and dark and pain beyond the wall called death?"" *He is afraid*, Sam realized.

""I dreamed...in the black of night a man asks all the questions he dare not ask by daylight. For me, these past years, only one question has remained. Why would the gods take my eyes and my strength, yet condemn me to linger on so long, frozen and forgotten?""

""My brothers dreamed of dragons too, and the dreams killed them, every one.""

""Stannis has some of the dragon blood in him, yes. His brothers did as well. Rhaelle, Egg's little girl, she was how they came by it...their father's mother...she used to call me Uncle Maester when she was a little girl.""

""Death should hold no fear for a man as old as me, but it does. Isn't that silly? It is always dark where I am, so why should I fear the darkness? Yet I cannot help but wonder what will follow, when the last warmth leaves my body. Will I feast forever in the Father's golden hall as the septons say? Will I talk with Egg again, find Dareon whole and happy, hear my sisters singing to their children?""

""The dragon must have three heads,"" he wailed, ""but I am too old and frail to be one of them. I should be with her, showing her the way, but my body has betrayed me.""

+++Sam, *A Feast for Crows*

Sam donned his blacks to say the words, though the afternoon was warm and muggy, with nary a breath of wind. ""He was a good man,"" he began...but as soon as he had said the words he knew that they were wrong. ""No. He was a *great* man. A maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn, and Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch, ever faithful. When he was born they named him for a hero who died too young, but though he lived a long long time, his own life was no less heroic. No man was wiser, or gentler, or kinder. At the Wall, a dozen lords commander came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He counseled kings as well. He could have been a king himself, but when they offered him the crown he told them they should give it to his younger brother. How many men would do that?"" Sam felt the tears welling in his eyes, and knew he could not go on much longer. ""He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. He was Aemon Targaryen.

After searching high and low, I finally unearthed a dusty old copy of *The Iron King* by Maurice Druon, the first in a series of seven books called *[The Accursed Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Accursed_Kings)* 

The series charts the rise and fall of the French House of Capet during the high and late Middle Ages. Violence, political intrigue and sexual license are the hallmarks of the narrative, much like *Song*. 

From the outset, the inspiration that GRRM took from Druon is painfully evident. And if the influence isn't clear enough, Martin himself has made [several shout-outs](http://grrm.livejournal.com/316785.html) and even helped re-publish the series in English. 

No doubt, thousands among us have hit the proverbial wall at the end of *A Dance With Dragons*. So instead of writhing in pain, why not make the wait for *The Winds of Winter* a little easier by picking up Druon's first book. Odds on favor, you'll pick up the next book and the one after that! 

Finding the book was made easier for me, since I live in France. But I found an English copy, and I'm sure there are others lurking around elsewhere in the world. 

Am I the only one who's snuffed this series out? I hope not.

* I think the Grand Maester Conspiracy is too complicated for the casual reader to ever be realistically a major plot point. It may end up as something that is subtlety hinted at, but for the most part, it will be disregarded by GRRM.

*  I can reasonably envision that the story will end with Tommen still on the throne.

* There will be only one big reveal of a surprise birth, most likely R+L=J. There's no way GRRM is going to play that card 3 times with Jon, Aegon, and Tyrion.

* Given her knowledge at the time, Catelyn's actions Pre-RW were pretty logical. She was a concerned mother who just got played by Littlefinger, as did many others.

* Jaime is possibly the best developed character of the series.

But one of the characters that I don't see mentioned as much is Euron, which is interesting because I think he is one of the more compelling villains in the series. I would say Euron is actually one of the most mysterious characters we've yet encountered. Similar to Varys and Littlefinger, we only have a vague outline of his life, and what details we do have only serve to make him more difficult to figure out.

What is his endgame? On the one hand, it seems like Euron may just be a run-of-the-mill warlord with a lust for power. He has always wanted the Iron Isles, but as Balon was the eldest son, that was never very likely. He was banished for raping Victarion's wife, which must have fueled his resentment for his family, and perhaps culminated in his decision to pay an assassin to take Balon's life so he could swoop in and claim the throne.

But if you ask me those ambitions seem too small for the man Euron has been sketched out to be. We know he has been traveling the breadth of the known world for years. He has an extensive knowledge of the mystical and the foreign: he's drunk shade of the evening, he has plundered distant coasts, supposedly sailed the smoking seas of Valyria itself, captured Pyat Pree and other warlocks from Qarth, an most important, acquired the dragon horn that he gave to Victarion before he left.

So how much does he really know, and what is his plan? Is he certain his dragon horn will work? Is it a trap to kill Victarion? Is it truly intended to bind Dany's dragons to the Greyjoys? If Euron does manage to acquire a dragon, either himself or by proxy through Vic, what exactly does he intend? He tells the Ironborn he wants to revive their ancient legacy and restore them as the terrifying reavers they once were, but as destructive as the Ironmen might have once been, possession of a dragon is simply orders of magnitude beyond it.

Does he want a coastal kingdom like in their glory days? Or does he want the throne itself? What might he know of the twisted game of politics on the mainland, the arrival of Aegon, or even of the Others in the north?

To me Euron is particularly fascinating because there are no other villains like him. Varys is calculating, but not necessarily sadistic. Joffrey and Ramsay are seemingly insane and vindictive, but not necessarily known for any grand scheming or foresight. Euron is a cipher. He's cruel and seems to delight in abusing others--we know he raped Victarion's wife and we pretty much know he molested Aeron in his youth--yet his cruelty is made all the more terrifying by his cunning. He's known for his tricks and manipulations: **""All Euron's gifts are poisoned""**. I feel like his great advantage beyond these is also simply that no one on the mainland knows what's going on with him. He's been missing for years, and when he makes his true strike, wherever it may be, it is going to be devastating and I don't think anyone will be able to anticipate it, even Varys.

Obviously we don't know how Martin will end the story, but its fun to speculate.

I think it would be very cool if the epilogue, or end of the last book, featured someone giving a romanticized retelling of the books; either in the form of a song (called ""Song of Ice and Fire""?) or someone telling a tale of it (like the stories from the Age of Heroes told by Old Nan and other characters).

We start the books in a land full of wonder, with stories of knights, heroes and magic; but we learn throughout the series the ugliness, hardship, and actual human aspect of the various conflicts throughout the novels. Especially with characters like Sansa, but really across the board, we learn that the fairy tales aren't true - that the world is gritty, and real, and has ugly, mean parts to it.

Given this deconstruction of the fairy tale, I think a fitting end of the series would somehow feature a romanticized telling of the age of the books. This would recast the story in the mythological light present at the start of the series; with brave, honorable knights, and a sort of fairy tale feel to it. Yet, we as the readers will know the fairy tale is false, that in actuality there was ugliness and brutality throughout. I think this would bring the series full circle, we would see the fairy tale myth reconstructed with the characters from the books cast as the various heroes. However, we would know the fairy tale is false, the myths exaggerated, and the truth of what happened during the time of the Song of Ice and Fire.

Just my thoughts, but I think it could be a cool deconstruction of the books, that would give the 'bitter-sweetness' that GRRM has said the ending will feature, what do you guys think?

&gt; A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness.

Now most people take this as being a blue winter rose: A symbol of Lyanna Stark. The crown that Rhaegar gave her at the tourney at Harrenhall was made of them and when Ned is hallucinating about the Tower of Joy he sees them. And the most common interpretation is that this represents Jon at the Wall, the supposed product of Rhaegar and Lyanna's love.

But I've not really seen the other character that the blue rose is associated with brought up in regards to this vision: Bael the Bard. Copied from the wiki at Westeros.org:

&gt; Bael the Bard climbed the Wall, took the Kingsroad, and entered Winterfell as a singer under the name of Sygerrik of Skagos. There he sang until midnight for the lord. Impressed by his skills as a singer Lord Brandon Stark asked him what he wanted as a reward. Bael asked for the most beautiful flower blooming in Winterfell's gardens. As the blue winter roses were just blooming, Brandon Stark agreed to offer him one. The following morning the single virgin daughter of the lord had disappeared. In her bed was the blue winter rose Bael had received from her father.

Here the blue rose is representative of the daughter of the Lord of Winterfell who is stolen away but how could Bael the Bard be relevant now? Well if there's any still living characters that Bael and Lyanna are compared to it's Mance and Arya respectively. Arya is compared to Lyanna in looks and if she was also the Knight of the Laughing Tree that would probably give a tomboyish personality similar to Arya. Mance is quite directly compared to Bael the Bard and when he goes to rescue ""Arya Stark"" from Winterfell he takes on the name Abel, an anagram of Bael.

So what's the point of all this? My idea, though I will not really say I'm confident in it, is that perhaps the blue rose in Jeyne Poole. She is ""Arya Stark"" who was considered so similar to Lyanna. She is being stolen away by a bard King Beyond the Wall from under the nose of the Lord of Winterfell and currently on her way to the Wall. I have no idea what sort of sweetness she could possibly bring to the place though, poor girl.

The implication is that he was going to kill Tyrion. But really, if:

* We assume that the Sailor's Wife is, in fact, Tysha.
* Littlefinger has lots of contacts in Braavos (his homeland) and he owns brothels. Also, he knows freaking everything. It makes sense he might know about her, 
* Tysha's marriage to Tyrion is still, technically valid. Tywin tried to make it go away by brutalizing her and sending her off. But Ty &amp; Ty had a valid ceremony and consummated their marriage. No High Septon ever set it aside, or could. They are still married. Any kid Tysha had from that marriage, that was Tyrion's, is Tyrion's heir.
* Assuming all the other major Lannisters end up dead and Tyrion is stripped of titles..
* And if lineage still passes through him (in spite of being a traitor and all), the heir of the West is a fourteen year old whore. 

Holy shit.

My prediction: Tyrion's going to have to make an awful choice. He'll be in some position to marry someone powerful, come sweeping in with sellswords and take control of the Rock and other bonus lands. However, fucking Littlefinger is going to show up with Tysha &amp; Lanna in tow. Tyrion will have the choice of recognizing Lanna as his kid and Tysha as his wife and losing the political alliance vs. saying that Lanna's a bastard and he doesn't know Tysha, thus keeping the alliance but purposfully turning away the only woman (besides Penny) who ever loved him, and his daughter.

1366143638.0,177,self.asoiaf,1chfek,"(Spoilers All) Nymeria, Gloves!",DatGrag,217,40,173,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1chfek/spoilers_all_nymeria_gloves/,"So I recently finished up ACoK for the second time and just started ASoS for the second time, and I am noticing a few more things in Arya chapters that I totally missed the first time around! I'm sure all of this has been found and talked about before, but I thought I'd share a few quotes from Arya's last chapter in ACoK (Her escape from Harrenhal), and her first chapter in ASoS.

As a preface, I'd just like to make sure that people are aware of what's going on with Arya's direwolf, Nymeria, during this time. The wolf escaped at the bidding of Arya and Jory after it bit Joffrey on their way to King's Landing. Around this time in the books, nearly every character in the riverlands mentions at one point or another about a huge pack of wolves that is running around terrorizing the countryside, and that they are led by one gigantic wolf. This is heavily implied to be Nymeria. Okay, back to the quotes:

1. During Arya's last chapter, this pack is known to be near Harrenhal. Recently a Bolton hunting party went out and killed 7 of them. Arya is in the Godswood, when *""far off, beyond the godswood and the immense stone walls of Harrenhal, from somewhere out in the world, came the long lonely howl of a wolf. Gooseprickle's rose on Arya's skin and for an instant she felt dizzy""*. After this, Arya hears her father's voice telling her to be strong, and that she *""has the wolf blood in her""*. As she lays in bed later that night, *""she could hear the sound of her own breath, and the wolves as well, a great pack of them now. They are closer than the one I heard in the godswood, she thought. They are calling to me.""* It is after all of this, and hearing that the castle will be left to the Bloody Mummers, that Arya is finally emboldened to risk escaping the castle. I think many would argue here that the ""voice"" Arya hears as well as the howling of the wolves all can be attributed to either Bran, coming back through time using weirnet(edit: this is not possible, according to Bloodraven, so disregard my points about it being Bran!), or maybe just Bloodraven. I **completely** missed the meaning of all of this the first time through, and had honestly forgotten it ever happened.

2. Now we go to Arya's first Chapter of ASoS. She has just killed the sentry and escaped with Gendry and Hot Pie. She knows that they will be pursued because of the killed guard, and all of the things that they stole on their way out, so she makes the boys drive their horses very hard, and deprives them of sleep. Here's the first quote from ASoS: *""she should be more frightened herself, she knew. She was only ten, a skinny girl on a stolen horse with a dark forest ahead of her and men behind her who would gladly cut off her feet. Yet somehow she felt calmer than she ever had in Harrenhal. The rain had washed the guard's blood off her fingers, she wore a sword across her back, wolves were prowling through the night like lean grey shadows.""* So all of a sudden after Arya has this touch with either Bran or Bloodraven, she is feeling super badass instead of afraid, and she somehow senses not only that there are wolves prowling around her, but also that these wolves are a source of **safety** to her. During ACoK she is terrified of wolves in the woods.

3. Later on in the chapter, *""Once, from the crest of the ridge, she spied dark shapes crossing a stream in the valley behind them, and for half a heartbeat she feared that Roose Bolton's riders were on them, but when she looked again she realized they were only a pack of wolves. She cupped her hands around her mouth and howled down at them, 'ahooooooooo, ahoooooooooooo.' When the largest of the wolves lifted it's head and howled back, the sound made Arya shiver.""* So now we have total proof that Nymeria's pack seems to be following Arya and protecting her. On top of this, Arya instinctively howls the moment she catches sight of the wolves, and ""the largest""(Nymeria) howls back at her.

4. Finally the three cannot ride any longer and doze in their saddles, they agree to stop and sleep. I'll spare the gigantic quote, but here Arya has a **full blown** warg dream. Like I'm talking just as much as Bran has, she dreams that she is Nymeria with her pack and she is mercilessly slaughtering Bloody Mummers in order to protect herself. 

That's all, I just was blown away when reading these two chapters. I did not grasp the first time through how much **power** this little girl has. She is literally controlling an entire pack of wolves to wreak havoc on the people who stand in her way, or who have wronged her family in the past. She feels comfortable in the knowledge that the wolves are protecting her even this early in the game. I just didn't realize how important Nymeria's pack was or that they had already had in person encounters with Arya. And I thought it was really cool!

**TL;DR:** Arya communicated with either Bran or Bloodraven while she was in Harrenhal, this was a huge reason she tried to escape in the first place, she is protected by Nymeria and her wolfpack during her runaway, and she wargs into Nymeria during a dream and fights the exact Brave Companion men that are coming to recapture her.

She explains to Jon that to make the glamor really work, bones work the best: ""a dead man's boots, a hank of hair, **a bag of fingerbones.""**

When I read that I was taken aback - a bag of fingerbones is an awfully *specific* and somewhat random ingredient for a glamor. The only other reference to a ""bag of fingerbones"" in the entire ASOIAF universe is Davos' bag around his neck, which he loses in the Battle of Blackwater.

Some will include popular speculation, some may get a bit tinfoily. It will heavily rely on a belief in RLJ theory.

The story is introduced by Meera: ""in the year of the false spring. The Knight of the Laughing Tree, they called him. He might have been a crannogmen.."" Which Jojen responds with ""or not.."" Jojen here automatically assumes that Bran has heard the story a ""hundred times before"" and is genuinely flabbergasted when he finds out Lord Eddard had never shared it with his son. Why would he be so surprised about Bran not knowing the story, just because it is cool and interesting, or is there a deeper meaning here?

The story begins with a Crannogman who is clearly special from a young age, and ""learns all the magics of his people."" Interesting because around this time magic was pretty nonexistent in the world. Anyways, this crannogman ""wanted more"" so he seeks out the ""green men"" on an island near Harrenhal. The crannogman spent an entire winter there with the green men, and when spring broke and he left, he found himself walking into a tournament.

*Quick Break:* So I'm pretty convinced here that this crannogman is almost definitely Howland Reed. I consider this story to be almost proof that he definitely has some *sick* magical powers that he is most likely using in a similar manner to what Bloodraven has done with Bran. Howland is watching. 

Back to the story, Meera briefly describes the ""fair maid"" of the tournament. ""but there were others fairer still. One was the wife of the Dragon Prince (Elia, wife of Rhaegar) who'd brought a donzen lady companions to attend her.""

At this point, our crannogman, whom I will now just refer to as Howland, he runs into some Freys. If you don't know, the Freys live very close to the swamps and generally hate people like the Reeds. The Walders at Winterfell both shit on the Reeds constantly. Howland runs into these Freys, three squires, and they rough him up a bit, kicking him on the ground. ""That's my father's(Rickard Stark's) man you're kicking, howled the She-Wolf.(Lyanna Stark)"" Lyanna enters the story for the first time, and she comes with more proof that this crannogman is Howland Reed. Meera continues, ""The she-wolf laid into the squires with a tourney sword, scattering them all.(Ahem, Arya's Aunt.) The crannogman was bruised and bloodied, so she took him back to her lair to clean his cuts and bind them up with linen. There he met the pack brothers: the wild wolf who led them (Brandon Stark), the quiet wolf beside him (Eddard Stark), and the pup who was the youngest of four (Benjen!). ""

Lyanna *insists* that Howland attend the feast that was to come for the tourney at Harrenhal. He was of high birth, with as much right to such as any other man. ""She was not easy to refuse, the wolf maid."" At the feast, we get the famous ""The dragon prince sang a song so sad it made the wolf maid sniffle, but when her pup brother teased her for crying she poured wine over his head."" Howland spots the Freys who beat him up, and Lyanna offers to find *Howland* some armor so he can take revenge on them. Howland thinks about it, but decides he is too shitty of a warrior and better to not attempt it. Howland sleeps in the Stark tent that night, and just outside the tent he says a prayer to the old gods for someone to take revenge on the Freys. 

It is my belief that, since he was so close to the Stark tent, and at Lyanna's invitation, that she overheard this prayer.

The day of the tourney the Frey's knights are doing really well, but late in the day the mystery knight appears. I believe that this mystery knight is 100% Lyanna Stark. Her face concealed, she ""was short of stature, and clad in ill-fitting armor made up of bits and pieces. The device upon it was heart tree of the old gods, a white weirwood with a laughing red face."" Lyanna likely painted the device to make it seem as though Howland's prayers had been answered. The mystery knight challenged the three knights of the squires who beat up Howland.When the Frey knights went to give the ransom, The knight answered in a ""booming voice"" through her huge helm saying ""Teach your squires honor, that shall be ransom enough."" Remember, Loras has been quoted as saying that being good at jousting only really requires skill on horseback, and we know Lyanna was one of the best horse riders of her time.

Later that knight, all the lords wanted to unmask the KotLT, and the mad king declared that the man was ""no friend of his."" He sends Rhaegar out to find the mystery knight, who claims all he ever found was his shield with the laughing tree. My theory as that Rhaegar succeeded in finding out Lyanna was the KotLT, and instantly falls in love with her because of it. Lyanna has already been wooed by Rhaegar's singing the night before, so the match is super possible. They spend some time together, Rhaegar decides to lie to his father and say he never found the knight. The KotLT never shows her face at the tourney again, and Rhaegar goes on to win the tournament.

Meera goes on to say that Rhaegar named Lyanna queen of love and beauty, in front of the whole entire realm, when the two did not even know eachother? I think not. He even did this in front of his own wife Elia and her attendants. 

**TL;DR:**

Lyanna was the KotLT.

Her idea to become a mystery knight and protect Howland Reed is the initial reason Rhaegar noticed her and was interested in her.

All of this is the catalyst for RLJ

Howland Reed has some decent ""green"" powers.


EDIT: Some people are saying this is the widely accepted view. This is true among the most diligent of readers, but I though it was worth posting because there are many on the subreddit who have never put all this together.

So I decided to break down each of the people that I see could fight Strong. These assume that Strong is headless Mountain.


[**Sandor Clegane**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sandor_Clegane)

*Pros*

* Sandor will get the fight and vengeance he wanted for so long.

* If Sandor is the gravedigger then he is part of the faith and can fight for it.

* *Valonqar* prophecy (loosely)

*Cons*

* He is at peace and “The Hound” is dead

* How will he find out and get there

* Potential Leg Injury

[**Nymeria Sand**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Nymeria_Sand)

*Pros*

* She will be pissed to see her father’s killer alive and want revenge

* Martel v. Clegane 2.0

* Her sister Tyene is trying to befriend the new High Septon

*Cons*

* She is not likely to win and I think she knows it.

* She could lose her spot on the small council

[**Ser Loras Tyrell**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Loras_Tyrell)

*Pros*

* It would be a good reveal if he is unharmed.

* Get revenge on Cersei for accusing his sister

*Cons*

* It is possible that he is extremely hurt

* He is also a kingsgaurd, and I do not know if he could participate

[**Random Faith Knight**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Warrior%27s_Sons)

*Pros*

* See how strong, “Strong” is.

* It would be kind of funny if Strong got beat by some noname.

*Cons*

* It would be kind of a letdown if there wasn't anyone important in this fight.

[**Ser Lancel Lannister**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lancel_Lannister)

*Pros*

* Extremely Pious

* Feels Guilty for helping kill Robert

* Not very bright

* Will Lose

*Cons*

* Will Lose

* I do not believe he is stupid enough to go against a ""Mountain"".

* Would go against his own Family

[**Ser Jaime Lannister**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaime_Lannister)

*Pros*

* Get revenge on Cersei

* *Valonqar* prophecy

*Cons*

* One Hand

* With Breinne and no intention returning to KL anytime soon

* There is a chance he would not have fought the Mountain with 2 hands if he had a choice

* He has better things to do, like trying not to be killed by Stoneheart.

* Kingsgaurd 

[**Garlan Tyrell**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Garlan_Tyrell)

*Pros*

* Better with a sword than Loras according to Loras

* Get revenge on Cersei for accusing his sister

* It is in Tryell interest for Cersei to be guilty, due to Margaery being accused as well and Cersei would be out of their way politically.

*Cons*

* Off fighting the Iron Men

* Extremely minor character

* Could lead to loss of Lordship

* If Cersei is found guilty, Tommen could be discovered not to be rightful king and Margaery will no longer be Queen. 

[**Ser Bronn of the Blackwater**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bronn)

*Pros*

* He knows Tyrion would love to see Cersei convicted

*Cons*

* He is preparing for his own thing

* He is not stupid

* He already refused to fight ""The Mountain""

**[Aegon Targaryen](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_Targaryen)/[Jon Connington](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Connington)**

*Pros*

* It would help the common folk see that Aegon is the rightful heir

* The could win King's Landing in the process

*Cons*

* A lot would have to fall in place in order for them to be there in time.

* There would be have to be a siege in order for them to get into King's Landing

[**Ser Theodan Wells**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Theodan_Wells)

*Pros*

* Commander of the Warrior's Sons

* Does not like Lannisters

* Keeps the Seven

*Cons*

* Whereabouts unknown

* Does not strike me as a Pious man

* Extremely not stupid

[**Lady Brienne of Tarth**](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brienne)

*Pros*

* Will gain some honor with Lady Stoneheart and Jaime

* Prove she is a knight

*Cons*

* Current whereabouts unknown with Jaime

* On a quest to find Sansa

If there is anyone else you think could play part in this trial please talk about it. Thank You.

Edit: I will try to keep this list updated with peoples suggestions 

Edit 2: I am going to add Jaime to the list even though there is no chance in hell he will fight ZomGor, he does have reasons why he would.

Edit 3: This is turning out way better than I expected, thank you everyone for contributing.

Edit 4: There have been some things brought up on whether certain people want Cersei to be convicted so here I am going to list some points people have brought up regarding what will happen if Strong wins or losses

**Cersei ""Innocent""**

* The people in direct power stay in power.

* It is proven that even the Queen regent can be judged by the Faith

**Cersei ""Guilty""**

* Raise doubts on Tommen's legitimacy

* Could lead to the reveal Tommen is not the rightful king

* Tyrell's could lose their control

* Stannis would be the rightful heir in place of Tommen, possible conflict between followers of the Seven and followers of R'Hllor

* Cersei will be punished

* It is proven that even the Queen regent can be judged and punished by the Faith

Edit 5: I have gone through and add links to the asoiaf wiki for each of the characters and clarified that if Cersei is found guilty it is not guaranteed that Tommen would be dethroned but it does raise his legitimacy it into question and could lead to his dethronement.

Her husband was always with his whores, and openly disrespected the marriage, and Naerys hated him.

Is there a chance that the son she bore him was indeed Aemon's, making the child illegitimate? And if Aegon found out about it, could that be why he legitimized all his bastards and gave the ancestral sword Blackfyre to Daemon instead? Because he found out that his only trueborn son was not even his own son?

People might ask that despite being on his deathbed, why didn't Aegon make his wishes known more clearly then? Maybe he did. Maybe he had it written on a piece of paper and signed it. Maybe the piece of paper was promptly torn up by his wife, who resented him for all his whoring, and wished her son, however illegitimate, to sit on the Iron Throne, or at least, not suffer from Aegon's wrath?

Maybe people knew about it, and that was why there was so much support for the Blackfyres.

People might say that it was just a rumor spread by enemies of Daeron, but Stannis Baratheon spread a similar rumor about Joffrey and not too many people took that one seriously either.

There are too many parallels to Robert and his family.

Young good looking man becomes King. Starts eating and whoring and disrespecting his marriage. Fathers numerous bastards. Wife seeks comfort in the arms of her brother, ends with a son that the King thinks is his own. On the King's deathbed, he makes decisions about the transfer of power, which is disregarded by his wife who was sick of him, and thus the illegitimate son of the Queen and her brother sits the Iron Throne, while the honorable, rightful heir tries to tell everyone about his right and wages war against the pretender occupying the throne.

By all accounts, Daemon Blackfyre was considered one of the best dudes around, a real stand up guy, so why would he wage a war unless he had reason to believe his cause was just?

Its pretty commonly accepted around here that Jon has warged in to Ghost by the time his body dies, and there is a lot of evidence that at his death, Winter finally arrives with the White Walkers.  I think that as the Others are attacking the Wall and the Night's Watch, Jon's body will be resurrected into a Wight, sans his mind, which is in Ghost.  However, Jon will then warg back into his body, essentially leaving him with a Wight's body, but a human mind.  That sounds similar to Coldhands or possibly even the Night's King.

Since season 3 of A Game of Thrones started, we saw a significant increase in subscribers.  Since we have so many new crows who have only recently taken their vows, we thought it appropriate to go over the more intricate parts of our title policy.  The following title spoiler tags are not the only spoiler tags, just the ones we are talking about today.  To read the full policy, [please refer to our FAQ.](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/wiki/faq)

Please remember that title spoiler tags set the level of spoilers in a post. They do not try to anticipate them. Therefore, commenters will adhere to what level you, as the poster, set - and if they go past that, they will use comment spoiler tags.

***

**(Spoilers All)**

These titles indicate that the following thread wishes to discuss anything, and everything related to ASOIAF.  Whether it be Dunk and Egg, the novels, future novels, interviews, the television show, *anything*.  Spoilers all means exactly what the name suggests...all things are allowed to be spoiled.

**(No Spoilers)**

This indicates that the author does not discuss any spoilers in their original post.

**(Spoilers ADWD)**

This indicates that the author wishes to discuss the five main novels, but nothing else.  Things like Dunk and Egg, and TWOW are not allowed to be discussed in these threads unless spoiler tags are applied. If you don't intend the thread to discuss TWOW, Dunk and Egg, or any other works, consider using (Spoilers ADWD) instead of (Spoilers All)

**(Spoilers TWOW)**

This tag is for when you want to talk about TWOW, and the five novels preceeding it, but do not want to talk about anything else.

**(Spoilers D&amp;E)**
  
This tag is for discussing all five novels, as well as Dunk and Egg - both nothing else.

[**Click here for the answer, it's long.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/125iad/meta_can_we_make_rasoiaf_a_spoiler_zone_by_default/c6scrma)

**Question:** The people who use (Spoilers All) are lazy, and could use a more specific spoiler tag. Why can't we get rid of the (Spoilers All) tag completely? 

**Answer:** People use the ""Spoilers All"" tag for any post that doesn't revolve around a single minor or specific detail. It's not out of laziness, it's because they want to have a discussion that brings everything we know about the ASOIAF universe.

**Question:** Why are there posts for discussion about the show? Isn't that what r/GameOfThrones is for?

**Answer:** This subreddit has a focus on the books but that doesn't mean discussing the show is inappropriate here. We're for all things related to ASOIAF just not the ""silly"" content.

__TL;DR - Stuff about Hospitality laws and Game Theory, Boltons/Freys are all going to die.__

###In honor of Sunday's glorious events this post is specifically built around the Wedding Party.

The laws of hospitality protect guests and more specifically people on diplomatic missions. You feed the message bearer salt and bread so he doesn't have to worry about getting his throat slit for his lords parchment (it is also an incentive for lords to go to other castles and try to make deals and shit). 

Player A has a decision to make, he can play the game normally and get a normal payoff or he can cheat(defect) and get a one- time massive payoff. Player B has several options at this point - he can [tit-for-tat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat) or [grim trigger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_trigger). I only give these two options because they are the only two that can return the game to normalcy and in ASOIAF there are multiple Lords filling the player B role. Tit-for-tat might work if there was only one family slighted, but since the number of families slighted is great I don't think Tit-for-Tat is a viable strategy. I should clarify: in this case tit-for-tat would be a single person coming to say...the Umber's house and being slaughtered. This leaves Grim Trigger as the only viable option, which means every slighted house _should_ (if they took game theory classes or are a ""rational actor"") punish the defector on every turn until the game ends (death for A or B). 
  
Roose and Walder defected and if Westerosi society has any wish of normalizing they have to reset the game because now it is stuck in grim trigger mode. Manderly is following the proper strategy, and I believe more players will (and probably already are) following the same course of action. I should note that while Manderly is actively pursuing the destruction of Bolton; many other houses don't have that option. The only way they may be able to punish the defector is something much smaller like not coming when banners are called. I would also like to note that once the grim trigger has been pulled the honor is off the table. We notice this when Roose only eats things Wyman does first. In a [culture of honor](http://www.gladwell.com/outliers/outliers_excerpt2.html) (especially in the north where IMO honor is even more important) when someone breaks an honor law, all bets are off. Which means Roose, Walder and everyone involved in the killing will all be murdered. The Dreadfort and the Twins will probably go to some other families.

Ramsay: ""But you've already told me everything, remember?  Your daddy was mean to you.  The Starks didn't appreciate you.  One good bit though: the Stark boys.  They're still alive.  Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember?  You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you.""

But I think some of those people don't realize the issues that plauged him with the two most recent books ""A Feast For Crows""  and ""A Dance With Dragons"" and why he took so long to get those books out.  We'll return to that in a bit, but if you look at the publication of the first three novels, you can see that GRRM is certainly capable of writing quickly, and without sacrifice of quality, let's looking at the publication history to demonstrate...

-  Start of writing to to publication of ""A Game of Thrones"": 1991-Aug 1996

Writing Time: 5 years/2 years

At first glance it seems like the first and shortest of the novels in ASOIAF took him a good deal of time to write, that being 5 years, and while technically correct, his main gig was still screenwriting at the time, and for three years after he started AGoT was sparingly being written.  GRRM didn't really start working on the first novel ""in earnest"" until 1994...  So if you want to look at this honestly it really only took him about a couple of years to get out the first novel..


-  ""A Game of Thrones"" Aug 1996 - ""A Clash of Kings"" Feb 1999

Publication Gap: 2 years, 6 months

The second novel was more rich, dense, and longer that the first, Martin now working on an Epic Fantasy series was able to expand his world building and create a plethora of new characters and interweave them into a better follow up in only 2 and a half years, not to mention the first of the Dunk and Egg novellas ""The Hedge Knight"" was published during this time. 

- ""A Clash of Kings"" Feb 1999 - ""A Storm of Swords"" Aug 2000(UK)/Nov 2000(US)

Publication Gap: 1 year, 6 months (UK)

Wow, if you need definitive proof that GRRM can write fast and with the best of quality, just look at this.  Only a year and a half to write what many consider the best, and one of the longest and densest novels in the series.  And according to the Wiki of Ice and Fire (where I'm sourcing these dates from), ASOS was considered ""several months late"" by his publishers.  But still, seeing this fact can't help but make someone optimistic for TWOW.

---------------

Now to the not-so-good publication times going into the two most recent novels, and the reasons why people cite this as their worry that the upcoming novels are still a long way off and that the series may catch up with the books, I want to illustrate some of the issues GRRM had with the two most recent books, and why since those issues no longer plague him that these worries are (to a degree) somewhat in-founded.

- ""A Storm of Swords"" Aug 2000 - ""A Feast for Crows"" Oct 2005

Publication Gap: 5 years, 4 Months

To understand why GRRM took so long to write book 4, you need to understand how the planned publication of book 4 changed multiple times.  When GRRM set out to write book 4 (Then titled ""A Dance With Dragons"") he had planned to advance the story 5 years after the events of ASOS and had begun work on a long extended prologue to do so, sometime later he decided against that route and had to take what he was working on in that prologue and translate that into actual chapters, including several more viewpoint characters, and had to start the book from scratch.  But the real biggest set back came when the Novel's length had grow larger than the 1500 manuscript page length of ASOS with (directly quoting GRRM here), ""No foreseeable end in sight"", he determined he would have to split the book in half.  As most people know (readers as well as non readers) ""A Feast for Crows"" and ""A Dance With Dragons"" were split geographically, not chronologically, and only half of the characters appeared in book 4, and the others appear in book 5.  Both pick up immediately after the events of ASOS.  When GRRM decide to split in this manner it forced him to again, almost start the book from scratch as many re-writes and edits were required to release the book in this fashion... but finally after 5 years ""A Feast for Crows"" was published.  He did however also publish the 2nd Dunk and Egg during this time as well, so blame a bit of the wait on it... Lol (but D&amp;E is worth it and helped readers at the time cope with the long wait).

- ""A Feast for Crows"" Oct 2005 - "" A Dance with Dragons"" July 2011

Publication Gap: 5 years, 9 months

With AFFC finished and GRRM heading into book ADWD readers were given a promise by GRRM when he stated that book 5 would ""be out next year"" in a authors's note present in AFFC.  GRRM also stated at that time that ADWD was half finished to back that up.  Since he didn't dispose of the ADWD POV chapters that were already written when ADWD and AFFC were one book, most assumed that he meant he was already halfway to home and would use those chapters...  Alas, no as with AFFC most of those chapters had to be re-written and he had to start ADWD from, you guessed it.... Scratch.  Whereas the problem with AFFC long write time was the decision to split the novel that forced re-writes, the big problem was organization and where to fit and how to structure ADWD. Not only was ADWD an organizational nightmare for GRRM, just within itself (more on that in a second), but he had to take great lengths to make sure the even though the books were split that the events taking place are chronologically in order. (Certain characters make references to other plot threads, and plot threads relate to each other cross-book). And making that all consistent was a major hurtle and influenced the long delay. But the biggest reason GRRM cites as his delay for ADWD is the ""Mereenese Knot"" (don't google that non-readers) which, without going into spoilers, was the complications that GRRM had within ADWD of getting a handful of interwieving characters to certain locations at certain points and have it all logically and chronogically consistent with each other. And if you've read ADWD, you know how interwoven some of these plot threads are and how such a thing could pose a problem.

Another thing to take into consideration into the delay for ADWD was the start of the HBO adaption of the novels that began in when HBO acquired the rights and started work on the show in the late 2000s... I'm not too sure of how involved George was early on, or if it was more than just the role of consultant and writing one script a year, but I'm sure once the show was greenlit, a considerable amount of his time was taken away by the show.  George also wrote and published the 3rd Dunk&amp;Egg novella during this time as well.  

- A bit of Optimism for a quick(er) ""Winds of Winter"" 

If there is any good news in looking forward to a quicker book 6, it is that the massive issues that plagued AFFC and ADWD are over.  As readers know 2/3 of the way through ADWD the plots from the split were rejoined when ADWD caught up with AFFC, and characters from the 4th book appeared in the last third of ADWD.  This means going forward GRRM is back to writing a straight forward and focused narrative.  I therefore, with the struggles of Feast and Dance behind him, see no reason fans should be overly worried about the final two books taking an overly long time to be finished, when he's demonstrated that when he writing on a focused story he can do it well and quickly.  

I don't expect the short gaps in publication for the final 2 books that we saw with the first 3, but I'm fairly confident that the era of 4+, or even 3+ year waits are over.   The biggest problem GRRM has now with getting the final books out are distractions.  We know he writes an episode a year, and still acts as an EP and consultant for the HBO show; as well as several public appearences he's made and interviews he's done are a large part of that distraction.  But I also think people over estimate exactly how much of a distraction it really is.  Several evenings a year to make these appearences, and some time to write a screenplay are not as large of a distraction as I think people make it out to be.  

I think it's within reason, that even with the distractions, that readers could possibly be reading ""The Winds of Winter"" by mid-2014.  We have not had a good update on his progress for a while now, but I'm optimistic that the light at the end of the tunnel is within Martin's view.  I also think while it will be close, that if GRRM keeps up a good pace ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" will be finished up with a nice lead way ahead of the show when ""A Dream of Spring"" will eventually be published..

These are of course my opinions, though I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback.  Thanks for reading.

1347900700.0,168,self.asoiaf,1012qg,(Spoilers / Speculation) Where in seven hells is Benjen?,tinydan,211,43,309,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1012qg/spoilers_speculation_where_in_seven_hells_is/,"Ok so we all know Benjen has been lost and assumed dead by many in the nights watch since he left in game of thrones. I’ve read theories that he is dead but resurrected and is now coldhands, other suspicions have been that he’s a warg. Neither really sits right with me. Two years is not a “long time” by the children’s reckoning or by man’s. Ned’s death would not be considered a long time ago assuming the occurred at the same time. With family histories that stretch back thousands of years a few years is nothing in comparison (regardless of how eventful). I personally hold the belief that Coldhands is the last hero from the long night but that’s another discussion. With the Starks, if you don’t have a direwolf, you’re not a warg. Seems to me if he were a warg, tree-Bran would find out.

So if Benjen is not Coldhands or a warg, where is he? Well not dead for one thing. A character like Benjen is a bit too notable to die without a POV character there to see it. Assuming he is alive where in seven hells is he?

**Tin foil hats on past this point**

Benjen has a rangers mentality, less likely to sit and wait for the foe to come to them much like Thoren Smallwood at the fist, but more like Halfhand in the way he’d be willing to get as close to the enemy as possible to learn as much as he can without the danger of certain death for his men.  Therefore I believe he is in some way involved with the others, most likely in an attempt to help the watch. There is much we don’t know about the others, other than (haarr) they’re smarter than the mindless wights they command. From what we have seen they have a language, fight like knights, armoured and armed with swords, and perhaps have a sense of honour, standing back to allow Waymar Royce fight one instead of many in the prologue though that may have been for fun. I do not believe they would kill a man like Benjen if they knew who he was; neither would they kill a man unless they didn’t have a reason for him to live. For this reasoning why would he be with them?

Benjen has been north of the wall for a while and has had time to discover things long forgotten by the watch. It is very likely that he has been in touch with the children of the forest or wildlings who know about the effectiveness of Dragonglass against the others and about the horn of Joramun, though it is likely he knew about the latter anyway. I lean more towards the children as they would be more likely to have an obsidian cache with very few hands to use them. They’d be more than happy to arm the watch with spare weapons.  With this knowledge and a mission to find the horn Benjen and his men would have a reason to stay north of the wall for longer than necessary. 

With no idea where or how I believe Benjen found the true horn of Joramun and stored it along with his cache of dragonglass at the fist when he knew he was done for in order to keep it out of the hands of the others. The cloak there was in too good condition to have been there for a long time so it stands to reason that the ranger to go north recently would have been likely to have stored it there. Being a man of forward thinking Benjen would have know the fist was a likely stopping point for any man, wildling or brother who wanted a defensible place to stay that far north, therefore increasing the chance it’d be found by a living man.

So his knowledge of the horn and perhaps his station in the watch and the north has kept him breathing. This is all going on his the assumption that the others can use the horn to bring down the wall and therefore the magic that prevents them from passing. This would explain their presence at the fist; the watch being a hindrance to them getting the horn and an added bonus, letting them kill some of the few defenders easily. They came for the horn. This could be why they came after Sam and Gilly in particular while other brothers survived for longer such as the ones Coldhands kills in dance. Gilly’s baby could be the reason but I like to think that the Martin would keep the horn as low key as possible. 

What purpose do the Others have for Benjen now? Only the weirwoods know but he could be attempting some form of diplomacy or it could be a darker reason. He could be a hostage, or they could need his blood and life for their own reasons (he does have kings blood). Only death can pay for life and it’s obvious that no matter how cold the others are they are fighting for their survival and lives.

So that’s my tinfoil essay, he wouldn’t have been north for so long without reason nor would he have died without some significance.

**tl;dr** Benjen is alive being held with the others.

I wish to produce some text evidence to support a new theory:

-----
Jeyne Poole wept so hysterically [after Ser Hugh is killed] that Septa Mordane finally took her off to regain her composure, but Sansa sat with her hands folded in her lap, watching with a strange fascination.
-----

-----
By then Septa Mordane had returned, alone. Jeyne had been feeling ill, she explained; she had helped her back to the castle.
-----

It would be extremely unlikely for Jeyne to become ill in such a short period of time. While Septa Mordane is an honest woman, she also is an expert at ladylike courtesy. I propose that in fact Jeyne has not taken ill, but that she is still hysterical and would be an embarrassment in public. ""Being ill"", then, is a euphemistic excuse of Septa Mordane to avoid more embarrassing truths. Tyrion comments that most men deny hard truths; perhaps courtesy at court is to conceal hard truths.

-----
He [Joffrey] raised his hand to summon a servant with a flagon of iced summerwine, and poured her a cup. She looked anxiously at Septa Mordane, until Joffrey leaned over and filled the septa's cup as well, so she nodded and thanked him graciously and said not another word.
-----

Here we see that Septa Mordane drinks alcohol.

-----
Even Septa Mordane was helpless before him [Moon Boy]; when he sang his little song about the High Septon, she laughed so hard she spilled wine on herself.
--
-----
She looked for Septa Mordane, and was startled to find her with her head on the table, snoring soft and ladylike snores.
-----

My theory here is that Septa Mordane has had enough alcohol to become very drunk. She is not simply clumsy, loud, and tired - she is intoxicated.

-----
Ned walked with the king to the jousting field. He had promised to watch the final tilts with Sansa; Septa Mordane was ill today, and his daughter was determined not to miss the end of jousting.
-----

Here is the tinfoil part of my theory: Septa Mordane is not ill; she has a hangover. This is why she misses the last day of jousting. She is using the same ""ill"" euphemism she used just a day earlier about hysterical Jeyne.

Maester Pycelle?,Manakin,204,35,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fvsmw/spoilers_all_oooohhh_maester_pycelle_who_did_you/,"I was doing a re-read of good old GoT. When I reached the conversation Ned and Pycelle have in his chambers about Jon Arryn maybe being poisoned, Pycelle states the following:
""Near 40 years I have been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms, Under our good King Robert, and Aerys Targaryen before him, and under his father Jaehaerys the Second before him, and even for a few short months under Jaehaery's father, Aegon the Fortunate, the Fifth of His Name""

It was at this point, my blood ran cold.

I'm sure a lot of people know, that this Aegon the Fortunate is Egg from Dunk and Egg. As mentioned in Later books, and the official Royal timeline, (hence the spoilers all tag I've put in). We are also told that Dunk and Egg died in a Mysterious fire in Summerhall castle.

Now, some people say he died in an accident trying to hatch dragons, but that sounds like a rumour to me, hundreds of people died in Summerhall, with no-one who knew exactly what the King was up to before he died living to tell the tale.


Guys, I think Pycelle killed Dunk and Egg.


I know it's quite a leap, Pycelle gets into the King's inner circle, and then the king dies, that doesn't mean Pycelle killed him, I'll give you all that.

But let's look at Pycelle's history.

He told Mad Kings Aerys to open the gates to Tywin Lannister's forces, thus intentionally leading to the Aery's death. 

And from ADWD:
Marwyn smiled a ghastly smile, the juice of the sourleaf running red between his teeth. ""Who do you think killed all the dragons the last time around? Gallant dragonslayers armed with swords?""

So yes, if you're willing to buy into the Maesters Conspiracy. It's entirely possible the Citadel sent Pycelle to be Grand Maester to kill Aegon, and future Dragon Kings. A little tin-foil hatish, but I think it's pretty plauseable.

Editing to update the list.

**Notable corpses:**

* a corpse of a young Westerosi man with thick curls, no obvious wounds and four golden dragons, found by blind Arya in the House of Black and White (I wonder if she finds him when she's blind so we don't learn hair color? Or perhaps it's even someone she'd seen in the past?) - mid ADWD, but after all Arya chapters from AFFC. Potential candidates: Tyrek Lannister

* there's a corpse pickled in brine on the ship from Volantis (the corpse's fate is unknown) - left Volantis mid ADWD

* a corpse of extremely fat pirate, killed in attempted attack at the ship Quentyn took to Volantis, that was dumped into sea - possibly Salladhor Saan?

**Mysterious appearances:**

* a hooded man in Winterfell who despises Theon, but who isn't recognized by him - can be part of Theon's delusions (**Munstered**), or can be real

* Lady Taena's first lover, a Myrish sea captain, half a pirate, with black hair to the shoulders and a scar that ran across his face from chin to ear. Possibly the face later used by Jaqen as the Alchemist.

* the Alchemist - identity Jaqen takes on when leaving Arya: ""his nose hooked, a scar appeared on his right cheek where no scar had been before. And when he shook his head, his long straight hair, half red and half white, dissolved away to reveal a cap of tight black curls.""

**MIA:**

* Edric Storm - last seen sailing off to Essos in ASOS, hiding in Lys according to ADWD appendix
 
* Tyrek Lannister - last seen during the riot in KL, back in ACOK. Would have been fourteen by AFFC, has golden curls and green eyes.

* Salladhor Saan - sailed off after becoming disappointed with Stannis

* Aurane Waters - sailed off with Cersei's fleet at the end of AFFC

* Darkstar - presumed to be hiding at High Hermitage in ADWD, but it's possible he fled from Dorne in mid-to-late AFFC

* Rhaegar
* Lyanna
* Eddard
* Ashara
* Septa Lemore
* Jon Snow

----
First, let's start with some relevant backgrounds to this case.

----
**Ashara Dayne**

Ashara Dayne was a noblewoman of House Dayne, the younger sister of the famous knight Ser Arthur Dayne. She committed suicide shortly after the end of Robert's Rebellion.

Ashara was tall, with long dark hair and haunting violet eyes. She had a reputation for great beauty. Many men were infatuated with her, including Barristan Selmy and, according to rumor, Eddard Stark.

Ashara was a lady-in-waiting to Princess Elia Martell. She was present at the Tourney at Harrenhal, where she danced with several men, including Eddard Stark after his brother Brandon spoke with her. 
After the events of the Tower of Joy, Ned Stark went to Starfall to inform House Dayne of Ser Arthur's death and return to them his greatsword, Dawn. Ashara jumped from the top of one of the towers of Starfall, called the Palestone Sword, on the cliff atop the sea. Her body was never recovered. After these events, Ned Stark returned to Winterfell with the infant Jon Snow, whom he claimed as his bastard son, refusing to name the child's mother. This sparked rumors that Ashara had been the mother of Stark's bastard, and that grief at learning that her lover had been responsible for her brother's death was the cause of her suicide.
Ser Barristan Selmy believes that Ashara gave birth to a stillborn daughter. According to Selmy, a man dishonored her at Harrenhal during the tourney and got her with child. In Selmy's account, it was grief at the death of her child (and possibly of her brother's death) and shame at being dishonored that led to Ashara's suicide. Also, Selmy thinks that he could have prevented Ashara's suicide if she had known of his feelings for her; that he thinks would have led her to seek his aid instead of a Stark's aid.

**Ned Stark**

[...] Once the conflict had ended and Robert had taken the throne, Ned returned home, bringing with him a bastard son, Jon, about whose origins he refused to speak, even to his own wife; he quickly silenced rumors that the boy's mother was the Dornish noblewoman Ashara Dayne.[...]

----

My question: Why are the subtles hints of R+L=J accepted as hard rock canon by most of ASoIaF fans while not-so-subtle hints of Ned + Ashara are constantly overlooked.
----

**Things that are well hinted or known inside the Lore**

* Ned and Ashara had a thing.
* Ned visited her, after killing her brother in a bloody senseless war.
* She jumped of a tower after Ned visited her.
* Ned gets furious when he hear talks of Jon being the child of Ashara

----

**Relevant Book Parts:**

* Cat

&gt; Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband's soldiers. They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys's Kingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur's sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet eyes.

* Cersei:
* 
&gt; You've a bastard of your own, I've seen him. Who was the mother, I wonder? Some Dornish peasant you raped while her holdfast burned? A whore? Or was it the grieving sister, the Lady Ashara? She threw herself into the sea, I'm told. Why was that? For the brother you slew, or the child you stole?

* Cat:
* 
&gt; If Jon had been born of Ashara Dayne of Starfall, as some whispered, the lady was long dead;

* Harwin:
* 
&gt; ""Aye, he told me. Lady Ashara Dayne. It's an old tale, that one. I heard it once at Winterfell, when I was no older than you are now."" He took hold of her bridle firmly and turned her horse around. ""I doubt there's any truth to it. But if there is, what of it? When Ned met this Dornish lady, his brother Brandon was still alive, and it was him betrothed to Lady Catelyn, so there's no stain on your father's honor. There's nought like a tourney to make the blood run hot, so maybe some words were whispered in a tent of a night, who can say? Words or kisses, maybe more, but where's the harm in that? Spring had come, or so they thought, and neither one of them was pledged.""

* Jojen on KotLT:
* 
&gt; the knight of skulls and kisses in a wine-cup war. The crannogman saw a maid with laughing purple eyes dance with a white sword, a red snake, and the lord of griffins, and lastly with the quiet wolf ... but only after the wild wolf spoke to her on behalf of a brother too shy to leave his bench.

**Bonus Facts:**

- Wylla was Ashara's servant

- GRRM:

QUESTION (1): will we learn more about the Sword of Morning? And, can you tell me anything of Ashara Dayne to sock it to the R&amp;L group?

ANSWER: Yes (regarding Sword of Morning); no comment about Ashara; and ""Have some more cheetos."" *GRRM grin*

QUESTION (2): I will spare you the rest of my speculations about the date of Jon's birth, since their only real conclusion is that Catelyn seems a little thick when she thinks that Ned fathered Jon as he returned 'Dawn' to Ashara Dayne.

ANSWER:As to your speculations about Catelyn and Ashara Dayne... sigh... needless to say, All Will Be Revealed in Good Time. I will give you this much, however; Ashara Dayne was not nailed to the floor in Starfall, as some of the fans who write me seem to assume. They have horses in Dorne too, you know. And boats (though not many of their own). As a matter of fact (a tiny tidbit from SOS), she was one of Princess Elia's lady companions in King's Landing, in the first few years after Elia married Rhaegar.

I'm not disputing nor advocating Jons parentage here, but something is not right.

If Jon is Ashara child, what is ""Promisse Ned... Promisse me?"", what was all the Rhaegar deal with Lyanna and what happened in the Tower of Joy and why is it so mysterious and important? 

What does Howlland Reed knows?

And if R+L=J why is Ned so upset about Ashara, just because he liked her and killed her brother and she killed herself? 

And if that's the case, why so much talk and red herring about it on the books and on GRRM comments aswell.


----

My personal opinion is that there are 2 plots there, one involves Jon Snow, and the other is something completely relevant albeit very different that is getting away from the eyes of people because of the shadow of Jons parentage.

Which is which, I do not know.

**TL;DR: 4 parents, 1 child.**

1340120265.0,165,self.asoiaf,va2tb,"(Spoiler Speculation ALL) Mental state of a Greyjoy, 
theory.",Iron_Felix,213,48,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/va2tb/spoiler_speculation_all_mental_state_of_a_greyjoy/,"No, not that one without his skin. Or that other one-eyed one. Nor wet one. Nor the who fell off a bridge. That other one. Victarion.(even though on mental issues he's a bit overshadowed).

So the question is:

Does Victarion Greyjoy have aspgergers, or autism, or some other similar form of a mental condition?

(NOTE: I'm using the 'old' portrayal of these kinds of mental conditions, as they would have been seen before the days of modern psychology, I don't mean any offense to anyone with autism or asperger's or other similar diagnoses.)

Reading through Vic's chapters, it always felt to me like the style of Martin's writing always had a different tone inside Vic's head. I don't know what to put a finger on, I'm not a professor of Literature, but on the whole, Vic's chapters feel more different to me than any other POV.

But there are a few individual phrases and other thoughts throughout his POV that got me thinking about this. Things like Victarion's views on laughter.

* ""Victarion Greyjoy mistrusted laughter. The sound of it always left him with the uneasy feeling that he was the butt of some jape he did not understand. Euron Crow’s Eye had oft made mock of him when they were boys. So had Aeron, before he had become the Damphair. Their mockery oft came disguised as praise, and sometimes Victarion had not even realized he was being mocked. Not until he heard the laughter. Then came the anger, boiling up in the back of his throat until he was like to choke upon the taste. That was how he felt about the monkeys. Their antics never brought so much as a smile to the captain’s face, though his crew would roar and hoot and whistle.""

That kind of dissonance between him and everyone around him, could be a sign that he lacks an understanding of empathy that comes more naturally to people with those mental conditions. It is in particular one of the stereotypical hallmarks of Aspergers.

I can't remember a single actual example of empathy being shown by him to any character. In many battle scenes throughout the series, there would be a little note to a 'poor' or 'unfortunate' man who is struck down, or suffers some horrific injury. We saw Tyrion's recoil of horror at the knight holding his own dismembered hand out as a token of parley, and Brienne's internal dialogue whether she can kill without hesitation, will she be able to ignore a person's humanity at the crucial point? 

But from all the battles from Vic's view, he is utterly dismissive of his opponents. He never once shows any hesitation in battle, he sneers at men who are afraid of drowning. He seems incapable, (or at least never shows the capability), of thinking inside someone else's head, of seeing another's point of view. Almost as if he assumes that the world as seen through his eyes is the same one everyone else must see. One line in ADWD, and it's implications, could be a hint towards this.

* ""The dragon queen awaits me in Meereen.""

At face value this looks like an announcement of intentions with a combination of a bit boasting, arranged as a slight twist of a normal phrase. But what Vic means exactly that? That he literally believes that Dany expects him? This would go right in line with the way he thinks that she will just obey, marry him and he will take her dragons. It is obvious to Vic that this will happen. He cannot think of a world that doesn't conform to his expectations.

And does Vic actually have any friends? I know these are hard men, even among hard men, but most POV's show us each character connecting with some of the others around them in some emotional way. But Vic compatriots just seem to be a crew that shows him respect and deference towards a commander. The closest he comes to a confidant is the Dusky Woman, who he uses as something to wank into.

His perceived ""simpleness"" was another thing thing that piqued my interest. He portrays himself at the Kingsmoot as nothing more than the continuation of the old line. Everything he says is short and concise. He never makes any metaphors, elaborations or any sort of 'creative' leaps of language at all. Asha describes him as a dutiful 'Ox', who will just plod along.

He states that it is his duty to obey his elder brothers in all things.

He kills his wife, because his tradition demanded it, even though he obsesses over it internally, constantly rationalizing it to himself that it was right, and when he thinks about it, his wife isn't even that important in the thought. It is *Euron* that occupies this obsession. Because it humiliated him. 

And yet he obeys Euron once he has been crowned, even though he despises him, as laws command.

This kind of almost blind adherence to a system of codes and rules makes Stannis look like Littlefinger. He thinks that if the rules are followed, (even if those rules are utterly insane and barbaric to us outsiders), then the natural order of things will be preserved.

Any of these things on their own could be seen as the manifestations of a very rigid personality. But combined together, Vic still seems very odd.

Remember, we are talking about a time with no concept of treating those with mental health issues. The existence of all but the most obvious and disturbing conditions would be thought of as nothing more than ""That man is odd, lets stay away from him"". How would they deal with a child showing signs of such conditions? Options are;

* Beat it out of him. Then beat harder.

* Keep him out of sight, make him do nothing but simple work.

* Send him to the Wall/wolves

We know the Greyjoys didn't exactly grow up in an understanding and nurturing climate. Their childhoods were hard and hellish by all accounts. I'm willing to bet that is was all stick and no carrot. Can you imagine a childhood on the Islands that doesn't involve hellish beatings for not falling in line and acting 'normal'?

 I think the Iron Islands are the only place in the world that Victarion could 'hide' his mental states in the already existing insanity of the Iron Islanders. In fact, it would seem that this is the one environment that someone with severe types of empathy and emotional disorders could not only fit in, but thrive. A condition molded to use its weaknesses as strengths in a hell-world.

(And of course this being a fantasy world, it doesn't have to actually be aspergers/autism or other actual condition that exists as we know it. But something of the same ilk, just as greyscale is the fantasy equivalent of leprosy/smallpox. So if a single aspect of those conditions does or does not exist in reality, then it could be an aspect taken from disease.)

TL;dr: Vicky-Joy has some sort of autism or aspergers that's not only exacerbated by the barbarity of the Islands, but *accepted and lauded* by his comrades, and actually is what makes him so deadly an Ironman.

Signs of some mental disorder;

* No understanding of humour.

* No empathy.

* No emotional expression at all to people he acknowledges as human.

* Rigid, almost irrational adherence to 'law/code'.

* Possibly doesn't understand that others actually think differently from him, (there's a specific word for this, can't think of it).

Some might claim that he does this because he is obviously undead and attempting to hide it, but truly he makes no attempt to hide his undeath. He only tries to hide his identity. This would imply that it is someone that Bran would recognize, the only possibility being Benjen.

With that assumption out of the way, we can move to my actual theory, which attempts to answer ""Why is coldhands good instead of evil?""

I believe that Benjen was actually a Warg. This is not too rare in the Stark Family, as can be seen. When he was killed, I believe that he warged into a bird or tree or any other generic animal.

I've always seen ""the North remembers"" as threat of vengeance or a call to honor, but I was thinking about that phrase in the context of the different religions in ASOIAF when this thought occurred to me.

The North is defined not only by a location, but also a religion. The Old Gods of the North are, as we've seen in Bran's arc, at least somewhat based on truth. When Bran wargs into a weirwood, he can see back as long as the tree had lived. Essentially, he shares the tree's memory.

If we take 'the North' to refer to to Old Gods, and further take the Old Gods to refer to Bran... Well, Bran can 'remember' a great deal of history.

In other words: Bran **is** the North, and he remembers.

I was rereading A Dance with Dragons for clues and found something that I haven't seen brought up before.

&gt; Jon took a knee. The king frowned at him, and rattled the parchment angrily. “Rise. Tell me, who is Lyanna Mormont?”

&gt; “One of Lady Maege’s daughters, Sire. The youngest. She was named for my lord father’s sister.”

&gt; “To curry your lord father’s favor, I don’t doubt. I know how that game is played. How old is this wretched girl child?”

&gt; Jon had to think a moment. “Ten. Or near enough to make no matter. Might I know how she has offended Your Grace?”

&gt; Stannis read from the letter. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is STARK. A girl of ten, you say, and she presumes to scold her lawful king."" (Jon I, ADWD)

Sassiest ten-year-old in the North. Also, the only outspoken supporter of a Stark king. That is, until...

&gt; “I know about the promise,” insisted [Wylla]. “Maester Theomore, tell them! A thousand years before the Conquest, a promise was made, and oaths were sworn in the Wolf’s Den before the old gods and the new. When we were sore beset and friendless, hounded from our homes and in peril of our lives, the wolves took us in and nourished us and protected us against our enemies. The city is built upon the land they gave us. In return we swore that we should always be their men. Stark men!” (Davos III, ADWD)

There's a common connection here. *Lyanna* Mormont. *Wylla* Manderly. If R+L=J is true, they're the names of the two women who took maternal roles towards Jon. Might this be a subtle hint by GRRM towards Jon's legitimacy and his future position as king?

**Edit for clarification: I'm remarking on GRRM's choice to name the characters supporting a Stark king after the characters who played a nurturing role in Jon's life. All I expect is that he will become King in the North – beyond that, I have no speculation. It's not an in-universe plot, it's a literary choice.**",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1369367507.0,,MormontOfBearIsland,True,t3_1ex7iy,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1ex7iy/spoilers_all_on_jons_preteen_fangirls/,

As many of you are aware we at /r/asoiaf have been holding an annual ""tournament"" for the ASOIAF characters since 2011. [You can read more about them here](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/wiki/tournaments). The first one was run by the good crow /u/Unbeliever03 with some assistance from myself. Last year's tournament was run by then-crow, now maester /u/PrivateMajor with a little assistance from myself as well. Both tournaments were a lot of fun and many people enjoyed them a great deal. However, we also received some complaints.

What was the primary complaint? Simple: that the tournament postings were cluttering up the front page of our subreddit and distracting from serious discussion about the books. Whenever someone PM'd us mods with such a concern, or made a public post about this concern, I was quick to point out that since 2011 it had basically become a tradition here. And *since it happens only once a year* I did not see any problem with allowing the tradition to continue.

Today user /u/asoiafmadness took the initiative to start his own March Madness style tournament [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1aos4m/spoilers_all_rasoiafs_64character_march_madness/). The post has been removed. 

It is the belief of the maesters that having multiple tournaments a year is not a good idea for this subreddit. Not only would they begin to pile up and overrun this subreddit but also it'd be like having multiple World Series' a year: eventually it'd feel like ""everybody gets a trophy!"" day. 

There should be one champion a year and one time of year *only* where a tournament takes place on this subreddit.

It is our hope that /u/asoiafmadness will work with us this **coming June** to help manage the next tourney. Clearly this crow has the chops and the enthusiasm to help make the **Tournament of Ice and Fire III** the best one yet. In the meantime for all of you who were excited to participate in a tournament of this style, please be patient. June is only three months away. In the meantime you can visit the [central hub post for the 2012 tournament](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/yhrgv/2012_asoiaf_tournament_central_hub/) which provides links to all the ""battles"". Or take a look at how it was done [the previous year](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/jkra3/official_asoiaf_reddit_tournament_discussion/).

Like you, I know that in the game of thrones you either win or you die. Considering this severe penalty, it is understandable that many of you out there are hesitant about playing. That’s why I’m here. This post will serve as a guide to any of you who wish to take your chances playing the game of thrones. We will start with the two principles that should guide every player of the game of thrones.

1.	Forget honor. Honor has zero place in the game of thrones. Bringing honor to the game of thrones is the equivalent of wearing a boat anchor to a swim meet: you could be the Michael Phelps of political maneuvering, but in the end the only race you’ll win is the one to the bottom of the pool.

2.	Trust no one. Period. Not your friends. Not your family. Not your house. No one.

With the burden of honor and trust off your back you are ready to play the game of thrones. While playing there are certain rules you should keep in mind.

1.	Killing children. In the game of the thrones, if you haven’t killed/attempted to kill children, you aren’t playing the game right. Pushing kids out windows because they overheard your plans, sending assassins after heirs to the throne, and killing kingly bastards are all things you should be doing while playing the game of thrones.

2.	Keep a personal food tester. If you are playing the game of thrones, somebody will try to poison your food.

3.	Never travel by ship in autumn. Ever. Statistics from Oldtown show that 99% of ships are lost in the autumn and that of the 1% of the ships that do make it to their destination, half are overrun by pirates and sold into slavery. However, if you are lucky enough to be on one of the .5% of ships that do make it to their destination, you will get laid.

4.	Religion. Choose the Red God. Happen to be poisoned. BAM, Red God. Need a shadow baby to kill another player of the game of thrones. BAM, Red God. Has a wound you received in battle festered? Bam, Red God. The Red God is definitely the best choice.

5.	Never put money in your mouth. You never know if there is left over poison on it from a Faceless Man assassination.

This is just a start for the ultimate guide. Are there more that you can come up with?

Edit: Some new rules. (Reddit formating sucks!)

6. I don't care how much ""dragon blood"" you have in you, you're not going to tame two feral dragons with a god-damn WHIP!!!!!!

7. If a red priest, who's made an absurd amount of true profosies, tells you you're going to be stabbed in the back, please listen to them.

Tyrion is a very complex, conflicted and likable character, has a great backstory and is just really awesome when he's on his element (politics). I find none of that complexity in Arya. I don't *dislike* her, she has her moments (the prayer of names, valar morghulis), and her path to becoming an assassin in the last books intrigues me a lot, but I don't see anything super special about her. Like Sam, she's just an OK character to me. She's a girl with a sword who defies gender expectations and kills people, alright.

Apologies if this has been mentioned before but I have read many of the theories and not seen it dealt with directly, if it has been then please link me in the right direction!

I am intrigued by the fate of Jon Snow post ADWD and likewise curious as to the identity and nature of Coldhands.

I am generally speaking in the camp that Jon Snow will be returning, though believe (mainly due to the Varamyr prologue) that this is likely to be via Warging to Ghost rather than Melisandre/other possibilities.

On Coldhands my main issue is rationalising how what appears likely to be a 'Wight' of a dead member of the Night's Watch could behave differently to other Wights. As with any magic in fantasy it is far strongest with some sort of rational basis or 'science' behind it. 

My theory is thus, that Coldhands is a NW Wight that has been warged into by someone with the ability to Warg. The quote that he died long ago could therefore take a different meaning and relate to the original Warger rather than corpse used (although the corpse could be the Warger anyway). The fact that Coldhand's can help Bran rather than act in a zombie like manner is therefore explained. His identity is then called into question (there are then various candidates who could be the Warger). 

Likewise, Jon Snow could warg into Ghost and subsequently Warg his corpse should it be animated by an Other. This could explain the blue eyed king with a flaming sword vision. The manner of his animation one could speculated as if he is put in the frozen cells with existing Wights (who's existence I feel could yet have more importance).

I have not entirely aware of the limitations of warging, except that I remember the human side fades once the body dies, which could refute this theory as Coldhands died so long ago he would have degenerated to Wight behaviour. Arguably though the fact that there is a human carrier lessons this effect.

I have not examined the evidence extensively but have yet to discover anything against this, what are your thoughts? 

Apologies again if this has been discussed.

   I was talking with another asoiaf nerd today about R+L=J, and we started talking about Ned.  I guess I've always focused only on what it meant for Jon, and not really considered what it *really* meant for Ned.  

   These were some of my thoughts:

   Ned gets to the TOJ to claim his sister, only to find it guarded by Kingsguard.  We know what follows, he makes the promise, etc.  (Again, these thoughts are based on the assumption that Jon is a Targ, and would be king instead of Viserys.)

   Think about how much that must have **sucked** for Ned!  He:

* is fresh off a years long war in which he led rebellion armies and saw thousands on both sides die - all to depose a (totally batshit) Targaryen king, and won  
* already has a taste of disgust for his best friend Robert when Tywin presented Rhaegar's murdered children and all Robert did was smile
*  has just discovered his sister has created a new king, who is not only his nephew, but a Targaryen
* has to promise to keep the baby's identity safe to protect him from Robert, his best friend
* just helped to kill three Kingsguard who were totally in the right by protecting Jon


   While choosing anything else was probably never going to happen, what that meant for Ned is staggering to consider.  By doing what Lyanna asked, his honor took a huge undeserved hit, his new wife was humiliated, the boy who should have been king had to live the life of a northern bastard, who wound up at the Wall.  Ned had to carry all of that.  No wonder he felt such guilt.  

But what was he going to do?  Switch sides immediately and try to put his new nephew on the throne with some regent?  Tywin had just sacked King's Landing, and the loyalist forces were decimated.  

I'm aware all of these things are obvious, but stopping to think about them is why I love Ned's arc so much - it's just such a beautifully tragic scenario that GRRM cooked up.   The ToJ and the mystery around Rhaegar is my favorite part of ASOIAF.

I've tried to -- I saw Parris there a moment ago, my lovely wife, who I've also recently named my ""Vice President in Charge of Saying No,"" uh -- I've always had a certain amount of difficulty saying no, so -- and these days I'm getting so many convention invitations and literary festival invitations and invitations to speak here and there and to travel to exotic places, you know.

For those of you not in the know, 
[Other-in-Law](http://www.reddit.com/user/other-in-law) is a bit of a legend over at [westeros.org](http://www.westeros.org). His beautiful maps of the fictional lands we all love, his extensive knowledge of heraldry, and his insightful comments about all things ASOIAF made him ""internet famous"" over there. It was from his artwork that we derived the vast majority of the shields you get to choose from for your flair.

Recently he contacted us mods, having just discovered our community here on the Wall. He was initially annoyed, and rightly so, that he had received no credit for creating the artwork that our team sampled in order to generate our amazingly [huge selection of flair](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/jr2m3/attention_heres_a_new_fully_automated_system_to/). He asked that we stop using his artwork.

However, it turns out he's a reasonable bloke. After some rational discussion and our sincere apologies for only ever crediting him in our CSS stylesheet, he has essentially agreed to allow us to continue using his work. For that, he has my thanks. You will also note that we have added an ""It is known"" section to our sidebar under which we give him the full credit he has always deserved.

For me, though, that isn't enough. OIL mentioned to me that one reason he didn't want to see his artwork anywhere on the web was because he was tired of seeing people criticize it. Apparently over at westeros.org, he's endured more than his fair share of trolls.

Let's show him how we do things on the Wall. My fellow Crows: how much do you love your flair? How awesome do you think his artwork is? Let's make this an epic thread of thanks and gratitude and well deserved praise for the man responsible for some of the best Westeros maps ever created.

Who knows... maybe if he gets the thanks he's long overdue for he'll even un-retire his DeviantArt account. Even better, perhaps he'll decide to take the black and join us here at /r/asoiaf.

1374751318.0,162,self.asoiaf,1j0roz,(Spoilers all) GRRM drawing inspiration from Black Death for oncoming Winter [TWoW/ADoS],TimSnowningBear,262,100,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1j0roz/spoilers_all_grrm_drawing_inspiration_from_black/,"[Dead men mocking the living](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Holbein-death.png)

We all know of the [long night](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_Long_Night), where death roamed among the living for a generation. Our favorite bitch (jape, see comments) Old nan told us following
*""Thousands of years ago, there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts; and women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept, and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks...In that darkness the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds...""*

It is basically the same with as in IRL europe - 
*Mothers killed their own children, kings died in their castles, fields got overgrown, spiderwebs grew in empty shacks, moss lingered on statues, open stinking massgraves everywhere, demons and foul minions rode on great hellish felhounds, everyone believed the great death was a punishment sent from God, or the Satan was unleashing the plague to pull with the sinners down to the eternal flames!*

With that said, I was thinking of when GRRM taking a lot of inspiration from the hundred years war, War of the Roses and other medieval events! Then why not, he is taking the great [Black Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death) as inspiration, transforming it from a pathogen infection into the Others.

Black Death **mocked the living**, agriculture fell, the population got decimated by 75 - 200 millions (which is fatal comparing to (if assuming) Westerosi having around 45 - 100 million population.  [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1ilzgl/spoilers_all_what_is_the_population_of_westeros/)!). 


All while Melisandre says the others are demons of the Great Other, roaming the Westerosi earth to pull with everyone into the dark void.

As IRL in medieval europe, everyone believed the invisible skeleton reapers roamed everywhere, to slay and take with everyone to hell.

Also the [artistic expressions of the Black Death](https://www.google.se/search?q=black+death+art&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=1gnxUb6vNsHetAbx94HYCQ&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=973&amp;sei=2AnxUeXbKojQsgakloCQCA#imgdii=_), often contains skeletons, demons and zombies dancing with the living ones. There is where GRRM took also inspiration, making the others (sometimes called as demons) and wights (skeletons, zombies) dance with the living.

So basically, the oncoming great winter is like a plague coming to infect the overripe Westerosi grape population, killing almost everything and make the lands inhabitable due to large amounts of people dying, thus leaving agriculture and commercial to its fate. And then trees, flowers, bushes start to grow where grain and corn grew earlier!

However IRL, after the Black Death, Europe got into a population boom and everyone had better life than before as there were vast areas of empty houses, farmlands, commercial to take control, the peasants going from serfdom to freewill, citizens came as a new class, cities grew and more.
**It was really a dream of spring! A new hope (Star Wars reference)**.

I can imagine that after the Long Night, Westeros endured a cultural, economical, population, agricultural, technology boost with the arrival of Andals and steelworking.

Now, from what we know it have gone 8000 years since last invasion of the Others, heck then its time for halloween party again.

**ALSO** by the oncoming book title after TWOW, **A dream of Spring**, we clearly can see where the long winter are heading, to a new fresh beginning! As in real life Medieval Europe endured 600 years ago.

Then what? Yeah, as in real history! Let us head back to scheming, killing each other over again as if Black Death/Great Winter never happened!

I read a passage from SOS today that might be relevant:

""The Rat Cook had cooked the son of the Andal king in a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms, lots of pepper and salt, a rasher of bacon, and a dark red Dornish wine. Then he served him to his father, who praised the taste and had a second slice. Afterward the gods transformed the cook into a monstrous white rat who could only eat his own young. He had roamed the Nightfort ever since, devouring his children, but still his hunger was not sated. **“It was not for murder that the gods cursed him,” Old Nan said, “nor for serving the Andal king his son in a pie. A man has a right to vengeance. But he slew a guest beneath his roof, and that the gods cannot forgive.”**

Martin, George R.R. (2003-03-04). A Storm of Swords: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Three (p. 631). Random House, Inc.. Kindle Edition. ""

As far as we know, Walder Frey is the first violator of guest right since the Rat Cook. Is it possible that he will suffer the same fate as the Rat Cook and be cursed to ""eat"" his children for the rest of time? I think that would be a great form of poetic justice as his line of children is a major source of his pride.

It's also interesting that the other part of the passage, a son being cooked into a pie, is also relevant to Walder Fry-- except this time it's his son(s) being cooked into the pie.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,,True,t3_xrjhw,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/xrjhw/spoiler_all_speculation_the_fate_of_a_certain_old/,

1361730509.0,159,self.asoiaf,1954hf,(Spoilers All) Myranda Royce &amp; Alayne Stone,galanix,198,39,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1954hf/spoilers_all_myranda_royce_alayne_stone/,"Myranda Royce is the daughter of Nestor Royce, and meets with Alayne/Sansa as she is traversing down from the Eyrie. There is speculation she may know Alayne's true identity and reveal it. I'll detail why.

***

##MYRANDA IS SHREWD

&gt;“M’lady,” Ser Lothor said, “you’d best know. Mya didn’t come up alone. Lady Myranda’s with her.”  
“Oh.” *Why would she ride all the way up the mountain, just to ride back down again?* Myranda Royce was the Lord Nestor’s daughter. The one time that Sansa had visited the Gates of the Moon, on the way up to the Eyrie with her aunt Lysa and Lord Petyr, she had been away, but Alayne had heard much of her since from the Eyrie’s soldiers and serving girls. Her mother was long dead, so Lady Myranda kept her father’s castle for him; it was a much livelier court when she was home than when she was away, according to rumor. “Soon or late you must meet Myranda Royce,” Petyr had warned her. “When you do, be careful. **She likes to play the merry fool, but underneath she’s shrewder than her father. Guard your tongue around her.**”  
*I will, she thought, but I did not know I’d need to start so soon.*

^(AFFC 41: ALAYNE II)

Even Littlefinger is wary of Myranda's wits, which should mean something. Sansa also notes it as odd that Myranda has come up to the Eyrie to escort their party down. She may already have suspicions from reports of Alayne at the Gates of the Moon.

***

##SANSA'S GAFFE

&gt;“[...] I aspire to be wicked. You must tell me all your secrets on the ride down. May I call you Alayne?”
“If you wish, my lady.” *But you’ll get no secrets from me.*  
[...]  
“[...] Oh, and the Night’s Watch has a boy commander, some bastard son of Eddard Stark’s.”  
**“Jon Snow?” she blurted out, surprised.**  
“Snow? Yes, it would be Snow, I suppose.”

^(AFFC 41: ALAYNE II)

Sansa is constantly guarding herself and her words in the chapter, but above she ""blurts"" out something, indicating she wasn't being guarded. Myranda plays it off like nothing special, but you could certainly make the argument that Sansa slipped up here.

***

##MYRANDA MAY NOT LIKE SANSA

&gt;Lady Myranda snorted. “I pray he [Harry the Heir] gets the pox. He has a bastard daughter by some common girl, you know. My lord father had hoped to marry me to Harry, but Lady Waynwood would not hear of it. I do not know whether it was me she found unsuitable, or just my dowry.” She gave a sigh.  
[...]  
“[...] Harry could have done much worse. I daresay that he will. Lady Waynwood will most like marry him to one of her granddaughters, or one of Bronze Yohn’s.”

^(AFFC 41: ALAYNE II)

Here we have a possible motive for Myranda wishing ill will toward Sansa. She was trying to wed Harry the Heir and seems miffed that she was passed over. She may bear resentment when Alayne, a common bastard girl, is wedded to Harry. Another possible motive is the death of Marillon the singer. Myranda was sleeping with him:

&gt;“[...] I bedded that pretty boy Marillion. I did not know he was a monster. He sang beautifully, and could do the sweetest things with his fingers. I would never have taken him to bed if I had known he was going to push Lady Lysa through the Moon Door. I do not bed monsters, as a rule.”

^(AFFC 41: ALAYNE II)

***

##COLD FEET

As pointed out by [gWiLiKeRzZz](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1954hf/spoilers_all_myranda_royce_alayne_stone/c8kx7ht), there is another possible hint that Myranda has pieced it together in a conversation she has with Alayne:

&gt;“[...] Usually when ladies share my bed they have to pay a pillow tax and tell me all about the wicked things they’ve done.”  
“What if they haven’t done any wicked things?”  
“Why, then they must confess all the wicked things they want to do. Not you, of course. I can see how virtuous you are just by looking at those rosy cheeks and big blue eyes of yours.” She yawned again. “I hope your feet are warm. I do hate bedmaids with **cold feet**.”

^(AFFC 41: ALAYNE II)

Here it's as if Myranda is almost mocking Sansa. Calling her virtuous and making note of her rosy cheeks and big blue eyes (both Tully traits). Also, ""cold feet"" is a common idiom used to describe someone who is nervous about a marriage or leaves a wedding prematurely. It could be a nod to Sansa leaving shortly after Joffrey's wedding, or her having left behind her husband (Tyrion).


***

##WHO COULD SHE TELL?

Littlefinger plans to reveal Sansa's identity following her marriage to Harry anyways, so why does it even matter if Myranda knows, who could she tell? [There is a certain sellsword named Ser Shadrich (aka ""The Mad Mouse"") who we meet at the end of the aforementioned Alayne chapter. There is good reason to suspect he has bad intentions for Sansa.](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1772ls/spoilers_affc_the_mad_mouse/)

I'll start...,I_Joe_Cooper,200,42,513,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/u0yz9/spoilerspeculation_all_give_me_an/,"No, this is not ""post your most ridiculous theory you can come up with"" thread. I don't want to hear shit about merlings and other stupid nonsense. I'm generally interested in the theories that you guys have come up with, events that you think will occur in Book 6 (The Winds of Winter) or Book 7 (A Dream of Spring?), anything **new** in regards to prophecy or predictions for the future of the series, etc.

Give me some new, plausible interpretation of a prophecy, or some crazy event that could happen in the near future. I'll start:

In A Dance with Dragons, we last see Jaime being whisked away by Brienne (after her encounter with the Brotherhood) to go ""rescue Sansa from the Hound,"" or something of that nature. We know that the Brotherhood spared Brienne's life for some unknown reason -- a word she shouted out before her hanging spared her life -- and that Stoneheart (Zombie Catelyn) is with the Brotherhood, hanging all those in her path (especially those who had a hand in the Red Wedding). While we know Jaime didn't necessarily have a *hand* in the Red Wedding, we know about Roose's little quote (one of the last things Cat heard before her death), as well as the fact that neither of Cat's daughters have been returned to... well anywhere ""safe,"" thus not fulfilling the oath between herself, Jaime and Brienne. So, needless to say, this whole scenario is going to lead us to an epic reunion between these three.

Now, before I get to the point, let's recap what we last saw with Victarion: he's taking a bunch of ships to Mereen to try to woo Dany (for himself, screw Euron) and he has that giant, killer dragon horn that Euron found. Victarion picks up a drifter (literally) by the name of Moqorro, a Red Priest of R'hllor (like Melisandre) and decides, against the wishes of his crew, to spare his life. Later, Moqorro uses his powers to heal Victarion's wounded hand (Azor Ahai-related, you decide), something Victarion once thought impossible. His new-and-improved hand seems stronger than before, and we have yet to see if it has any extra ""powers."" My feeling is that it will be significant in one way or another, but that's for a different time!

So now I bring you to my point: **If** Jaime survives his reunion with Lady Stoneheart, I think Thoros, using the same Red God powers that we've seen from him, Melisandre, and Moqorro, will be able to animate Jaime's golden hand. They will then entrust Jaime with some mission, one which I don't even want to speculate on (I would rather let GRRM mind-molest me once again with his crazy plot twists and schemes).

Totally plausible, but probable... Well, let us discuss!

The other books had plenty of foreshadowing &amp; rumors, but ADwD was the first where, after I had finished it and was reading forums, it had me saying, ""Wait, what?  That happened?""

These things go beyond theories, IMO, particularly because they're about events that happened within the scope of the story, as opposed to all the stuff people speculate about what happened before the start of GoT.

There are five that I have discovered, but were there other things that happened that seemed ""obvious"" to some of you but went right past me?

1.  Lord Manderly serves up the Freys in a pie.  This one seemed particularly tricky, as it seems to have hinged on us remembering a few sentences from ASoS that told us who the Rat King was; I had read that book ten years ago - no way I would remember that.

2.  Theon has been castrated or worse by Ramsay Snow.  Coyly referred to in his chapters; easy for me to miss because his narration is so filled with self-loathing that talk of being ""not a man"" or shame at being seen made it slip under my radar.

3.  Bloodraven is the three-eyed crow.  Not exactly obvious, but once the evidence is presented, it's the only reasonable conclusion (only for people who have read the Dunk &amp; Egg stuff, obviously).

4.  Arya kills her target with a poison coin.  Yeah, this one is pretty obvious, but for some reason I failed to connect all her lessons with the assassination.  I knew the coin was what did it, but I assumed it was some kind of ""magic coin"", given that the floodgates have pretty much opened when it comes to how the faceless men have access to pretty dramatic magic.  Dumb me.

5.  Jon Connington is gay - either carrying a torch for Rhaegar, or there was actually a covert relationship between them.  My gaydar is hilariously bad; you really have to beat me over the head with evidence before I finally realize this (I was well into my twenties before I figured out the truth about my stereotypically lesbian aunt and her ""friend"" of two decades).  This one verges close to the ""theory"" boundary, partly because it is about events that happened before GoT, and partly because it's not really ""plot-influencing""; whether Connington was gay or just extremely loyal/devoted probably wouldn't have changed the way he acted in the story.

EDIT:

6.  Abel is Mance Rayder.  See, there was one I actually saw; it seemed too obvious to me to put in this list, but clearly what is obvious to one person is not to another.

One thing I don't see people talking about is the fate of the Night's Watch.

I don't see how the Night's Watch will survive after Jon's death.  There are only a few scenario's I could envision.  

1) The Night's Watch tries to do something about all the Wildlings south of the wall.  The Night's Watch is severely outnumbered, even with the help of The Queen's Men.  The wildlings are now well rested and better armed than they were north of the wall. Some of them even hold castles, albeit crumbling castles.  I don't see how the Night's Watch could win that war.

2) There is a civil war in the Night's Watch - not everyone was in on the plot to assassinate Jon.  Mean while the others are marching on the wall and the wildlings won't be happy with their biggest (and only) spokesperson now presumed dead.  In the end, the Night's Watch gets annihilated trying to figure out what it's best course of action is as they will not be a cohesive group.

3) The Night's Watch simply crumbles and disbands.  After Mormont and Jon Snow were both assassinated by their own brothers, I don't see too many people eager to jump up and claim the position of Lord Commander.  Being outnumbered by Wildlings and with the others marching down on the wall maybe the Night's watch will simply fall into chaos and disband.

There might be more outcomes but those are the ones that jump out to me the most.

And in any of those scenario's that opens up Jon to be resurrected and possibly becoming Lord of Winterfell, the PWP, Sword of the Morning, a piece of The Three Headed Dragon or any of the other theories floating around here.  

I don't even think it's worth discussing the possibility that Jon won't come alive again one way or another, but if you think he's going to stay dead I'd love to hear why.

I also think that this will be the event that rallies the Seven Kingdoms to turn their focus away from fighting each other and to focus on the real looming threat, The Others.  I would imagine who ever leads the realm into victory against The Others will be the one who sits on the iron throne at the end of the series.

[previous entry](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/wtc6c/i_made_an_interactive_flash_based_map_for_asoiaf/)

So I made a lot of changes; the biggest being the info boxes that pop up.  All the info is basically copy/pasted from [AWOIAF](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Main_Page).  I modified some of it and changed the formatting obviously.  I didn't proofread it all so there may be errors or typos here and there.  I'll fix them if you let me know.

All the info is as of the beginning of AGOT, so there aren't any spoilers and none of the info boxes *should* contain any real spoilers (just backstory).  If a location doesn't have pop-up information it's because the wiki had less than one or two lines on it, so I didn't bother to include it.  If there are any other locations you'd like to see on the map let me know and I may include them; however, I won't add anything that is somewhat speculative.

###POSSIBLE FUTURE UPDATES

**AMOIAF Lite:**  Let me know how this latest version performs on lower-end computers.  It's all vector graphics and text so the file size is &lt;1MB and I think it should work well on most any computer.  But if it's inordinately slow on lower-end computers I may make a ""lite"" version without certain features.

**AMOIAF Uber:** I also may make a jumbo sized version for displaying at higher resolutions (obviously you'd need a fast machine for it to work smoothly).

**A Guide of Ice and Fire:** I realize that a lot of people would love to see a chronological timeline.  You could see characters moving, armies moving, territories changing hands, and text notifications of major events.  Play, pause, and skip to different timepoints/chapters.  I could probably implement all of the functionality.  However, I wonder what you guys think is the best chronological timeline out there.  I haven't done much research into this yet, but is there a universally agreed upon timeline?  What is the best one to go by?  If there isn't a good one maybe you guys could help make one for me so I can make the Guide.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1343679061.0,,EuronCrowsEye,True,t3_x6hmc,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/x6hmc/amoiaf_v11_i_updated_my_interactive_flash_map/,
1340472497.0,161,self.asoiaf,vhmdz,The Battle of the Green Fork: Analysis. [Spoilers thru ASOS],lordhadri,181,20,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/vhmdz/the_battle_of_the_green_fork_analysis_spoilers/,"Enough speculation topics about the unwritten books. let's talk about a major event in the first one!

The Battle of the Green Fork is, to date, the only pitched battle GRRM has described in detail. But I've always been confused about what was going on because of how Tyrion relays the information. He gives a very accurate description of how the Lannister army was arrayed, but then doesn't give a similarly detailed description of the Stark army. His confusion during the battle makes it hard to understand what really happened. And finally, we don't even see this Stark army again for another book and a half so we don't know how bad the losses were.

Another thing that always confused me was Tyrion's squadron described as ""the Left"" and ""the Vanguard"" at the same time, and trying to figure out what Tywin intended by doing it that way.

After a careful reading of Chapter 62 (Tyrion XIII) I have produced this crudely-drawn tactical map of [The Battle of the Green Fork.](https://imgur.com/cZUGK)

**The Lannister Army:** 20,000 men in total.

* The Center: About 10,000 archers and infantry under the commander of Kevan Lannister

* The Van: A mixed force of mounted mercenaries, knights, and mountain clansmen. Commanded by Gregor Clegane.

* The Right: 4,000 heavy cavalry under the command of Addam Marbrand.

* The Reserve: 2,500 cavalry and 2,500 infantry commanded by Tywin Lannister. 

**The Army of the North**

* 16,000 infantry, mostly spearmen, under the command of Roose Bolton.

When looking at the battle visually, two things come to my mind:

First: Tywin says he intentionally deployed weak troops on the Left, so that his heavy cavalry could slam the door shut with a cavalry charge from the right. What goes unstated is that Tywin wanted the Starks to attack as closely to the river as possible, so that he could attack with cavalry from two sides simultaneously and make retreat impossible. This shows that Tywin is willing to draw up complex battle plans even when he has a numerical and materiel advantage, and that he trusts his lords to have the discipline to carry out those plans. This is why Tywin was considered the best general in Westeros.

Second: **What is Roose Bolton thinking here?** He must know how difficult this battle is to win. Yet he deploys spearmen offensively and advances on a line of Lannister cavalry. There's just no way this attack plan could work. Why didn't he find a hill to defend and let the Lannisters come to him? Is Roose just inexperienced?

But let's look carefully at how he deployed his men. The Stark army took thousands of casualties, but remained large enough to be a threat after the inconclusive battle. Yet many Northern lords were either captured or slain. It looks as though Roose deployed his overconfident commanders in front, as if to eliminate as many rivals as possible for his future ambitions in the North. When the Lannister sprung the trap, he was able to retire with much of the army still intact, but left his fellow lords behind.

Finally, the Battle of the Green Fork is a good demonstration of the superiority of heavy cavalry in medieval combat. However, cavalry, no matter how disciplined, cannot overwhelm a polearm formation unless the formation is disrupted, such as happened at the [Battle of Hastings.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_hastings) Like William the Conqueror, Tywin utilizes combined arms: his archers force Stark infantry to the left flank where he wants them to attack. Clegane's headlong charge into the Karstark shield wall would have been wasteful, if it had not been Tywin's intention to join the battle on the left where he could not be outflanked thanks to the river.

I hope this is interesting to some of you. My main discussion question is: was Roose Bolton already betraying the Starks at this early stage?",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1340491279.0,,RowanOfGoldenGrove,True,t3_vhmdz,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/vhmdz/the_battle_of_the_green_fork_analysis_spoilers/,

If you will recall, many (loyalist) refer to Robert as the Usurper for his overthrow of the Targaryen dynasty. However, if we assume that RLJ is true, then Robert's title of Usurper becomes devastatingly ironic (since the spark for the rebellion came from Robert's love being usurped).

But it doesn't even stop there...since we know for a fact that Robert was further usurped of a rightful heir by Cersei and Jaime. Their incest ensured that his line would end with him, effectively removing his hold on the Iron Throne. 

The greatest tragedy of Robert is that the only thing he ever truly usurped was a throne that he never really wanted, didn't make him happy, and ultimately one that he was never made to sit upon.

1370479494.0,156,self.asoiaf,1frcbt,[Crow Business] Just recruited? Welcome to the Wall!,Jen_Snow,181,25,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1frcbt/crow_business_just_recruited_welcome_to_the_wall/,"Crows,

The popularity of Sunday's Game of Thrones episode has seen an influx of crows joining the Watch. We always welcome new recruits but before they can take their oaths, they've got to learn our ways. 

For long-time crows this will all be a review. For the members who've just come up the Kingsroad, here are the basics are below. For a more in-depth look at *all* of the polices of /r/asoiaf, [please see our FAQs](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/wiki/faq).

***

##1. The (Spoiler Tagging) System for Post Titles

**All** threads should have a spoiler tag associated with them. Please choose ONLY from the examples [listed in the FAQs](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/wiki/faq#wiki_2._how_should_i_title_my_thread.3F), which indicate which level of spoilers are to be contained in your thread. 

Spoiler tags *set* the level of spoilers in a post. They do not try to anticipate them. Therefore, commenters will adhere to what level you, as the poster, set. This means that ""Possible Spoilers"" or ""Potential Spoilers"" or any iteration thereof are not valid choices and will be removed by a moderator.

Similarly, we don't do gradations of spoilers. (Minor Spoilers AGOT) isn't a valid spoiler tag.

**Please use the spoiler tags listed in the FAQs or on the submit page exactly as they're written. Those are the available options.**

##2. Spoiler Tags in Titles -- Specifically, when to use (No Spoilers)

There has been some confusion recently on when to use (No Spoilers). From the FAQ:

&gt; * Use (No Spoilers) when there are no spoilers in the post you are submitting or you don’t reasonably expect there to be spoilers.

&gt; * (No Spoilers) What other book series are similar to ASOIAF? would be a correct usage of (No Spoilers). Answers won’t likely contain spoilers.

&gt; * If you ask “What happens to Ned during Game of Thrones?” and claim “No Spoiler”, you’re being technical. Yes, there are no spoilers in *your* title or OP but there’s no way to answer your question without spoilers. (Spoilers AGOT) would be the correct tag to use here.

The third scenario is what we’ve run into most often recently. We will continue to remove these posts. 

##3. Spoiler Tags in Titles -- What do they Mean?

Spoiler tags in titles denote what scope the discussion is going to take. They *do not denote which book you’re referencing*. This is why most of the posts in /r/asoiaf are (Spoilers All). The discussions can encompass all of the books, the show, Dunk &amp; Egg, the preview chapters, and anything GRRM has said. 

A discussion about events from ACOK has a different tone when the spoiler tag is ACOK vs. All. Things can be discussed in context of the larger story, foreshadowing has come to fruition, etc.

This won’t apply in quite the same way to current readers. Your spoiler scope will likely be set to the book you’ve just finished rather than (Spoilers All). Still, it’s not that your tag is telling us which book you’re talking about; rather, it’s telling us what scope the discussion can take without using spoiler code. It just happens that yours is more strictly tied to a book as you’re still reading.

##4. Memes and other ""Silly Content""

Our [meme policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/wiki/faq#wiki_15._what_is_your_policy_on_memes_and_.22silly.22_content.3F) applies to posts in /r/asoiaf. 

A meme or silly content submission shall be considered any post intended for the sole purpose of eliciting laughter while not contributing to or beginning serious and/or interesting discussion about the A Song of Ice and Fire universe. This includes links to advice-animal style memes, rage-comics, animated gifs, parody videos, pun-filled self-post threads, and any other content deemed to be of no intrinsic value to the /r/asoiaf community as determined by the maesters.

Photos, videos, blog entries, news articles, and any other post that leads to interesting discussion shall still be allowed even if said post involves crazy, tin-foil-hat style speculation.

Anything that falls under the ""silly content"" category will be removed by moderators.

##5. Off topic posts

We try to keep all of the content here in /r/asoiaf as on topic as we can. Posts like ""So glad I found this place"" or ""How I feel about this subreddit"" don't fall under on-topic. We're glad you're here too. Let's just show our appreciation for each other by providing lots of tinfoil and merlings, ok?

1366034452.0,156,self.asoiaf,1ce0hs,(Spoilers All/S03E03) My favorite character is so watered down in the TV series,alycks,198,42,150,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1ce0hs/spoilers_alls03e03_my_favorite_character_is_so/,"I want to vent a bit about HBO Jon Snow. To this point, D&amp;D have gotten more wrong than right with our favorite Stark bastard and this really upsets me. I thought season 1 was fairly strong in terms of the writing of the character, but Kit Harrington's performance was a bit sulky to me at times. Though Tyrion (I think) did refer to Jon as ""sullen"" in the books, so maybe his performance was apt.

Jon Snow in Season 2 has been discussed at length. His journey with Qhorin was just so tepid compared to the books. Qhorin's excellent speech after Jon freed Ygritte, Jon acting like a wounded pup around Craster, following Craster out into the woods, etc. This problem was continued into Season 3 when he met Mance Rayder. Rather than an interesting discussion on exclusion and freedom, we got ""Ah dun' lahk thaht Crahstah is killun 'ez suhns!""

But the worst part for me? Jon Snow is a WARG. His connection with Ghost is arguably just as important as Bran's greensight. Jon has always been close with the old gods, and Ghost is his strongest connection! Ghost looks like a weirwood tree, even. Ranging beyond the Wall was very much a battle with the elements of winter, and Jon's connection with Ghost helped Jon and his brothers scout out the wildlings in the Frostfangs. Then Jon meets Orell (noted warg), which meant a lot more in the books since Jon is sorta onto the fact that he's a warg too. Instead, the meeting with Orell doesn't really land.

I guess they can start developing Jon's warginess now, but it would have been stronger in my opinion if they had begun establishing it early. It wouldn't have even taken so much screen time, since the phenomenon would have been much like Bran's and viewers would get that the same thing is happening to Jon. Oh well.

For me it was: 

1. When she thought of how she liked to lick Robert's seed of her fingers, and thinking of it as ""eating his children"". WTF?

By what means do Nobelmen and or their subjects exactly identify someone who's deserted from the Night's watch.. Vs. someone who is away from the wall for other reasons. 

We have seen before several NW men away from the wall on Night's Watch business, such as Yoren, Thorne, and now Sam.  And it seems to be perfectly within NW guidelines for a NW member to visit his family, should he have any... As seen with Benjen Stark.  We cannot Also forget that the NW also turns a blind eye to the constitutionals it's members take in Mole Town. 

So if a Night's Watch member has to move about the realm for legitimate ""non desertion"" reasons, how does he travel about without being accosted and questioned by every Lord at every stop?  And how does the general public tell the difference between a member on business or a deserter?  

Does a NW member have to carry around documentation wherever he goes to prove he's not a deserter?

This question came to mind when I read a post about if Stannis were in Dany's Mereenese (probably misspelled) Knot. 

Tyrion wakes up scarred with no nose after an attempt on his life. He immediately seeks out his father, and demands justice for the act of cutting off his nose.  Tywin would *maybe* be, to some degree, impressed by his son's change in demeanor and talents at grinding his teeth while frowning.  Tyrion would accept his role in the marriage of Sansa because it's his duty, consummate the marriage, and prepare to move North as warden. Before he leaves, after investigating the attempt on his life,  Tywin is poisoned by someone and Tyrion flees to the Westerlands to investigate and rally troops. 

Stannis sulks back in Dragonstone.  Stannis gets the itch and goes to his wifes quarters, thoroughly drunk.  Shortly after, he leaves her chambers and repeals his ban on whores on the island. Lost, he falls into a melancholy state until Davos brings him the Black Letter.  Since he has a deep fascination with The Wall, he embarks to save it.  He arrives just in time to save the Nights Watch, though sustains many more casualties.  Afterward, he befriends Jon and lets the Wildings pass through The Wall.  Unsure where kings go, he sulks in the Nightfort while possibly growing alliances with the Northern Lords.

Brynden ""Blackfish"" Tully escaped Riverrun with the real Jeyne Westerling.  The Jeyne encountered by Jaime after the siege of Riverrun was actually Elenya (Jeyne's younger sister).  Jeyne fled with Brynden because she was pregnant with ~~had given birth to~~ Robb's heir and wanted to protect it and herself from the Lannisters.


**THE EVIDENCE**

**Hips don't lie**

ASOS - Chapter 14 (Catelyn II):
&gt;She was pretty, undeniably, with her chestnut curls and heart-shaped face, and that shy smile. Slender, but with good hips, Catelyn noted. She should have no trouble bearing children, at least.

AFFC - Chapter 44 (Jaime VII):
&gt;Jeyne was a willowy girl, no more than fifteen or sixteen, more awkward than graceful. She had narrow hips, breasts the size of apples, a mop of chestnut curls, and the soft brown eyes of a doe. Pretty enough for a child, Jaime decided, but not a girl to lose a kingdom for. Her face was puffy, and there was a scab on her forehead, half-hidden by a lock of brown hair.

The most notable incongruity is her having ""good hips"" vs ""narrow hips"".  Catelyn describes her as ""pretty, undeniably"" while Jaime paints her in a less flattering manner as ""willowy"" and ""more awkward than graceful"".  Jaime also describes her as ""no more than fifteen or sixteen"".  At the beginning of ASOS Jeyne is listed at sixteen years old in the index.  The Siege of Riverrun occured about ~~a year~~ 5 months after the Red Wedding, making Jeyne at least seventeen when Jaime ended the siege.  

**What makes me think she was switched with Elenya (her younger sister)?**

Elenya would have been thirteen at the end of the siege, making her fit the description of being ""no more than fifteen or sixteen"".  When Catelyn and Robb leave Riverrun they mention that Lady Sybell Westerling was left behind along with ""Jeyne, her little sister Eleyna, and young Rollam, Robb’s squire"" (ASOS 45).  Yet there is no mention of Elenya post-siege.  Jaime meets Jeyne, Lady Sybell says “Rollam is with me"", and Jaime even sees Lord Gawen Westerling, but Elenya is never seen nor mentioned as being in Riverrun. 

Also, after the siege, fake-Jeyne is sobbing, uncontrollable, and like a frightened animal.  Does this sound like the courteous dignified 17-year-old Jeyne, or the impetuous behavior of a 13-year-old, being forced to play into a farce?  The explanation of this is that she is grieving for Robb, who is dead for ~~a year~~ about 5 months at this point.  Meanwhile, Lady Sybell (the mother) is there the whole time looming over fake-Jeyne, possibly scared she may do/say something, she even slaps her at one point.

**But didn't Lady Sybell give Jeyne 'moon tea' every morning to keep her from getting pregnant, per Tywin's request?**

We don't know the efficacy of moon tea, it's not exactly FDA approved.  Plus who knows what Lady Sybell really did.  She may have been lying to the Lannisters for all we know.  

EDIT: courtesy of /u/Jilax  
&gt;From AWOIAF: Flower tansy, mint, wormwood, a spoon of honey, and a drop of pennyroyal. This is the recipe for Moon tea. That's definietly not what Jeyne was drinking....

Keep in mind she's a Spicer, a family of upjumped merchants, and her grandmother was Maggy the Frog, the old crone who gave Cersei the valonqar prophecy.  Maybe Maggy gave Sybell a prophecy of her own about Jeyne.  The point is there's a lot of murky area where this family is concerned, it wouldn't surprise me if she's playing both sides.

Plus the Blackfish has always been about ""Famiy, Duty, Honor"".  He's basically the last competent Tully alive and has always been about serving his family.  Him keeping Robb's queen and heir safe is entirely consistent with his character.

**Foreshadowing**

An absolute ton of foreshadowing about Jeyne being pregnant and the danger her baby would pose.

ASOS - Chapter 14 (Catelyn II):
&gt;Slender, but with good hips, Catelyn noted. She [Jeyne] should have no trouble bearing children, at least.

ASOS - Chapter 20 (Catelyn III):
&gt;“Jeyne,” she called after, “there’s one more thing Robb needs from you, though he may not know it yet himself. A king must have an heir.” 

&gt;The girl smiled at that. “My mother says the same. She makes a posset for me, herbs and milk and ale, to help make me fertile. I drink it every morning. I told Robb I’m sure to give him twins. An Eddard and a Brandon. He liked that, I think. We . . . we try most every day, my lady. Sometimes twice or more.” The girl blushed very prettily. “I’ll be with child soon, I promise. I pray to our Mother Above, every night.”

&gt;...

&gt;...the sound of the rain on the roof mingled with her father’s breathing, she thought about Jeyne. The girl did seem to have a good heart, just as Robb had said. And good hips, which might be more important.

ASOS - Chapter 45 (Catelyn V):
&gt;“I[Robb] had hoped to leave Jeyne with child . . . we tried often enough, but I’m not certain . . .” 

&gt;“It does not always happen the first time.” Though it did with you. “Nor even the hundredth. You are very young.”

AFFC - Chapter 44 (Jaime VII):
&gt;Jeyne Westerling had been Robb Stark’s queen, the girl who cost him everything. With a wolf in her belly, she could have proved more dangerous than the Blackfish.

&gt;...

&gt;“Best keep some archers near Lord Westerling’s daughter as well.” 

&gt;Ser Forley seemed taken aback. “Gawen’s girl? She’s—” 

&gt;“—the Young Wolf’s widow,” Jaime finished, “and twice as dangerous as Edmure if she were ever to escape us.” “As you say, my lord. She will be watched.”

**EDIT**: ~~With the siege occurring well over a year from when Robb and Jeyne last were together.  It must mean that Jeyne had given birth by the time of siege and was not pregnant.~~  Based on [this timeline](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/31411-global-timeline/) it appears the Siege of Riverrun ended about five months after the Red Wedding, which means Jeyne would have been pregnant after the siege.  Women can be fairly active even 5 months pregnant, so it's possible she swam under the portcullis with the Blackfish. Another possibility is that she hid in plain sight as a commoner waiting for the Lannister/Frey contingent to die down and would've slipped out afterwards and met with the Blackfish.  The reason her sister Elenya was so distraught over the plan was because she was to be escorted to and interred at Casterly Rock until such time as they married her off.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,1350481021.0,,EuronCrowsEye,True,t3_u1mb4,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/u1mb4/spoilers_all_my_take_on_the_jeyne_westerling/,

His banter with Tyrion in the books and the show give an otherwise very dark world a touch of humor. But after a recent reread, I came to the conclusion that we don't really know that much about him.
He's a sell sword of a presumably lower birth, who became rather rich and powerful quickly after helping Tyrion. We can assume, that like most sell swords, his loyalty does not reach far past the steady supply of coin, if it does at all. Last we heard of him, he was amassing a small army of sell swords for some unknown purpose, but we know little else about him. We don't know how truly loyal he is to Tyrion (although the show implies that there is something in the form of a genuine loyalty there), we don't know what he is planning to do with the small army he is gathering, or who his allegiance is with. We don't even know how good of a swordsman he really is (while he seems confident in his abilities, he hasn't gone against anyone we know to be of real talent, so it may be he has just been bluffing).
So what is really going on with Bronn? Is he simply an up-jumped sellsword, or do you think he has some power play going on?",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,NightsWatch,True,t3_1ke9kj,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1ke9kj/spoilers_all_lets_talk_about_bronn/,

Is the Braavosi dead?,Wazula42,248,94,289,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1geek4/spoilers_all_lets_settle_this_once_and_for_all_is/,"I'm speaking of course of Syrio Forel. GRRM's said he's getting sick of getting asked about Syrio, but to the best of my knowledge, he has not confirmed one way or the other if Syrio is dead. Let's examine the facts:

**Support for Syrio being DEAD:**

* He has not appeared or been mentioned, even in passing, by a single character apart from Arya since AGoT. Not once does Cersei think to herself ""Boy, I wonder if Qyburn wants to experiment on that Braavosi we have in the black cells"" or ""Boy, that sure was weird when Meryn Trant had his ass handed to him by that Braavosi weirdo from book one.""

* Meryn Trant attacked him. Meryn Trant is alive and well.

* Trant had backup. Even the First Sword can be overcome against multiple guards, especially when he's unarmored and has only a wooden sword.

* The First Sword of Braavos ""does not run."" Syrio would see it through to the end, one way or the other.

**Support for Syrio being ALIVE:**

* Syrio is a master swordsman, and he was holding his own right up until his sword was snapped in half. We've seen how bulky plate armor can be completely ineffective against opponents more light on their feet (as in the duel between Gregor and Oberyn, ending notwithstanding). I get the sense the First Sword of Braavos has faced odds like that before.

* There's speculation Syrio may be a Faceless Man, or may have some of their skills. He was a hot shit back in Braavos, it seems very likely he was at least *aware* of the Faceless Men, and anybody as dedicated to his craft as Syrio would find such training appealing. If so, he could be in disguise as nearly anyone anywhere, tho there's no clear candidates for a Syrio transformation as yet.

* Perhaps he kicked Meryn Trant's ass and let him live. Perhaps he was impressed with his fighting ability. Or perhaps he was subdued and captured, in which case he could be in a cell somewhere.

* Both the TV show and the novel make very conscious decisions to NOT show Syrio take a sword through the chest. Knowing GRRM, this tends to mean *something* is going to come of this. Seeing Syrio get shanked would've given Arya some real Batman-style motivation to be the best little assassin she can be, so it feels like a very significant decision to not have that happen.

tl;dr - Syrio was up against heavy opposition, unarmored and mostly unarmed. His attacker is still alive and kicking. Syrio seems to have vanished into thin air. What do we think?

Edit: BONUS EVIDENCE (?) Miltos Yerolemou, the actor who played Syrio, did an AMA a while back and even he's not sure if Syrio died. So.... helpful?

One last edit: So farther down in the thread we got a pretty solid argument for Syrio being dead that I think might explain the cut-away in both book and show right before he gets sworded to death. Syrio's whole deal is to teach Arya to ""see what is there"" and all that jazz. Perhaps that's the point of Syrio's not getting shanked. We the audience must set aside our conjecture and wishful thinking and see what is right there before us, a mostly unarmed man against a squadron of elite nights who is never seen or heard from again.

-Euron Greyjoy

With TWOW and ADOS hopefully coming in the yes-so-distant future, one of the storylines I've most anticipated is Daenerys' possible future prospects with alliances and preparations for her landings in Westeros. 

I've already analyzed and predicted her broad short-term future [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/18upuq/spoilers_all_speculation_the_good_invasion_bad/), essentially stating that Aegon is going to snap up possible Targaryen allies and seize the Throne before Dany makes it across the Sea. This will set up another ""Dance of Dragons"" war between Dany and Aegon, with Dany looking the villain. 

One of the big points in that post is that Daenerys' set of allies will be viewed by the Westerosi as barbaric. She will be bringing thousands of ex-slaves, Unsullied eunuchs, Dothraki, and sellswords to a starving Westeros in the grip of Winter. 

She will have one ""ally"" from Westeros, however: the Ironborn. Victarion is almost destined to do something stupid and die screaming in Slaver's Bay (burnt by dragonfire?), but the Iron Fleet will be Daenerys' transportation. The sight of her on Drogon and the death of their Iron Captain should be enough to cow the remaining Ironborn into Dany's service. 

The wildcard here will be Euron. Here's Moqorro talking about what he sees of all the threats Dany faces:

*“Only their shadows,” Moqorro said. “One most of all.* **A tall and twisted thing with one black eye and ten long arms, sailing on a sea of blood.”**

The description of Euron's dragonhorn that Victarion and Moqorro have:

 **A twisted thing it was, six feet long from end to end, gleaming black and banded with red gold and dark Valyrian steel.**

Earlier in AFFC after the victorious Battle of the Shield Islands, Euron summons Victarion to his chambers before sending him to Meereen:

*Euron stood by the window, drinking from a silver cup. He wore the sable cloak he took from Blacktyde, his red leather eye patch, and nothing else.* **""When I was a boy, I dreamt that I could fly,"" he announced. ""When I woke, I couldn't . . . or so the maester said. But what if he lied?""**

With this and Euron's introduction during the Kingsmoot, Crow's Eye is clearly being built for big things, not just raiding and defeating the Reach. 

I [personally believe he's going to get himself a dragon](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fuxh4/spoilers_all_can_we_talk_about_crows_eye/cae28am?context=3 ). This would indeed make him Dany's most major threat, but also perhaps her strongest ally. Her dragons are her biggest advantage, and would be absolutely necessary in any war with Aegon. This would make an alliance with Euron key. 

Among Dany's visions in The House of the Undying:

*Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars.* **A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly.** *A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness. . . . mother of dragons, bride of fire . . .*
 
Many believe the second vision to be Jon Connington, yet he doesn't seem to fit in here and Aegon has likely already been mentioned (*mummer's dragon, cloth dragon*). Grey lips smiling = Greyjoy? Not that much of a stretch. Corpse = ""Drowned man"", a ritual all the Greyjoys go through. 

It seems now that the Dornish path (with Quentyn) was always intended to quickly go up in smoke (heh), leaving Dany to go the Iron route. The required partnership with the newly dragonriding Euron could cost Dany even more than expected: 

*“King Crow’s Eye, brother.” Euron smiled. His lips looked very dark in the lamplight,* **bruised and blue.**

*Euron turned to face him,* **his bruised blue lips curled in a half smile.** *“Perhaps we can fly. All of us. How will we ever know unless we leap from some tall tower?”*

There are many other mentions of Euron's ""blue lips"" throughout the Ironborn chapters in AFFC. He very obviously dabbles in dark sorcery and magic. The Qartheen Warlocks he tortured and currently holds (incidentally he got them while they were on a quest to wreak vengeance on Dany, and this led to Euron finding about her) have been teaching him gods know what. The lips coloring is due to his constant consumption of the Warlocks' [Shade of the Evening](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Shade_of_the_evening). The Shade is also what Dany drank in the HOTU *""so that you may hear and see the truths that will be laid before you [Daenerys].....""*

Now we know that the Targaryens oft have [very prophetic dreams](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragon_dreams). Good examples include Egg's brother Daeron, Daemon II, and Daenerys herself. We seem to have another prophetic dream in ADWD, which incidentally comes right before her marriage to Hizdahr:

*Beneath her coverlets she tossed and turned, dreaming that Hizdahr was kissing her*..... **but his lips were blue and bruised,** *and when he thrust himself inside her, his manhood was cold as ice.*

There are no gods, only religions and magic. In the absence of understanding magic, powerful practitioners of magic believe them to be manifestations of God. As such, the practice of magic becomes associated with (and disseminated through) religion, and magic is attributed to the power of the Gods, rather than magic.

Interestingly, there does seem to be at least one group, the Guild of Alchemists, who has harnessed the power of magic without any associated faith. Conversely, the Faith of the Seven appears to be a religious group without any immediate connection to magic, that we've seen so far.

In the end, the Song of Ice and Fire isn't about a battle between R'hllor and the Great Other, but rather between ice magic and fire magic, as wielded by their respective practitioners, who only appear to be servants of said Gods.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,Kingsguard,True,t3_1fuzqu,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1fuzqu/spoilers_all_there_are_no_gods/,

Also, if you check out the appendices you learn that the Sailor’s Wife has a daughter, Lanna. Lanna is a 14 yo whore with long gold hair –p.732. Given her age and description it’s possible that she’s Tyrion’s daughter. The name Lanna can also be short for Lannister.

There is going to be a wedding soon, and boy is it going to be awesome.

Throughout the whole series, GRRM has been building up the idea of the BwB, an organization looking to protect the weak. However since SoS we have seen the BwB's slow transition from an organization vying for peace, to one looking for vengeance.Now instead of helping smallfolk, the sole purpose of the BwB seems to be the systematic killing of everyone related to the Red Wedding. 

Now why is this post titled the Red Wedding 2.0. Well first of all we know that there is going to be a wedding in Riverrun. Daven Lannister and some Frey girl are going to get married to strengthen the alliance between these two families. We know that many (not all) Freys and Lannisters will attend the wedding. Now you may think just because there's a wedding doesn't mean it will immediately end in tragedy. Sure, we have Joffrey's wedding, Robb's wedding, ""Arya""s wedding,etc. but there have been a few bloodless, albeit miserable wedding experiences. Well, wouldn't it make sense that the Brotherhood without Banners is looking to give the Freys and the Lannisters a taste of their own medicine.

We know for the nonce that Tom O' Sevens is in Riverrun acting as a bard. What the hell is he doing there? Did he quit the brotherhood? We are given absolutely no explanation to why he's there, which is a bit suspicious. This doesn't automatically mean death to all the Frey's, but it does give the BwB an ally inside the walls of Riverrun. We also have the complete support of the Riverlands, especially Riverrun. It is no secret that the north and the Riverlands hate the Lannisters and the Freys. So it isn't crazy to believe that some of the smallfolk or the soldiers who were pardoned to turn on the Freys. However, what I believe to be the greatest piece of evidence is the UnCat is leading the BwB. She is a character that is completely bent on revenge and will do anything to get it. Hell, she should know that Arya and Sansa are somewhere, alive, and instead she's off killing every visible Frey. So I don't think that Tom O' Sevens being in Riverrun is a coincidence. We also know that the BwB is very close to Riverrun. We see how one of the Freys (I forget his name, there are too fucking many of them) gets murrdered when heading to the Twins, in an area extremely close to Riverrun. This is all speculation at this point, yet I believe, nay, I wish this to be true. I would also like Arya to be there to chop Walder Frey's balls off and feed it to Nymeria, but I have less evidence to support that.",,False,self,t5_2r2o9,False,,,True,t3_whcd0,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/whcd0/spoiler_all_red_wedding_20/,

As my sigil/flair suggests, I have absolutely no love for Tywin or House Lannister, save Tyrion. In fact, as a Targareyn enthusiast I would love to have seen Tywin burn for what Gregor did to the royal family. However, through any objectionable view Tywin Lannister wielded power as well as any character in the entire series. I ask you to bear with me because this post is going to be lengthy, but in order to make an objectionable case for the man's brilliance it has to be. I will try and address many of the criticisms thrown Tywin's way in this [Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1iwlno/spoilers_all_possibly_the_most_overrated/) and several others. 

&gt; Tywin's destruction of House Reyne and Tarbeck wasn't that impressive

When Lord Tywin was a child/teenager the ineptitude of his father's rule in the Westernlands left House Lannister nearly in ruin to the point that the Lannisters were openly mocked. The two most powerful vassals in the West, House Reyne and Tarbeck, eventually rebelled. House Reyne was said to be nearly as wealthy as House Lannister at this point in time. House Lannister on the other hand was constantly losing wealth becasue Lord Tytos would loan coin to his bannerman and not demand repayment. I have seen several people mistakenly call the Tarbecks and Reynes *lesser houses*. This is a mistake that I attribute to them believing that only the Great Houses of Westeros wield any real power. House Lannister having to put down a rebellion from it's two most powerful vassals is the equivalent of the Starks dealing with the Boltons and Karstarks simultaneously, or the Tyrells dealing with House Hightower and Redwyne simultaneously. Success was far from assured. Despite all of this, Tywin decided to take control of the issue as a *teenager* who had never held military command beforehand. Quoting the Wiki directly, ""It is said that he exercised his command brilliantly and efficiently"". The final result was the complete **annihilation** of the two most powerful vassals in the West that resulted in the *Rains of Castamere.* A song that sends a warning to any who dare cross the power of House Lannister. From that point forward he took the remnants of his disgraced house and over several decades restored it to become the most wealthy, powerful, and feared house in the entire realm. 

Now I would like to address the issue which many Tywin detractors seem to gloss over, his reign as Hand of the King. I'll just quote the Wiki directly:

&gt; Tywin proved himself a brilliant administrator and held the post for twenty years of peace and prosperity. Some people joked it was he and not the king who really ruled the land. 

To put this into perspective you need only look at every single hand that ruled after Twyin. Most of them were disgraced and eventually killed. If anything, the facts show that Tywin's rule was *too effective*. It was Aerys' jealousy and paranoia that drove Tywin away from King's Landing. The man held the realm together for two decades of peace and prosperity under the **Mad King**. How can he not get credit for this? 

&gt; Tywin's reputation came from acts of Brutality

**Agreed** but I think this criticism is given from a negative bias towards Tywin and the Lannisters in general. However, looked at objectively, brutality is an *effective tactic* in GRRM's world. Tywin completely destroyed House Tarbeck and Reyne because he knew that his vassals/bannerman would never forget that lesson. When one bannerman did, House Farmen, all Tywin had to do was send a singer to play the Rains of Castamere. House Farmen never again made so much as a peep in objection to Tywin. Tywin also sent his dog, Gregor Clegane, to dispose of the royal family when he sacked King's Landing. The result of that order was nothing short of horrific. Was this simply a brutal and unnecessary order? No, I have no doubt that Tywin had the foresight and cunning to realize that if ANY of the Targareyns were spared then they would serve as a threat to the throne. The only principal actor in the Usurper's War who objected to this order was Ned. Ironically, it is the Stark's devotion to honor and integrity that largely led to the ruin of Winterfell. 

&gt; Tywin was a coward and hid out during the Usurper's War

This criticism is again based on subjective opinion that ignores the facts. Tywin ignored Aerys' plea to join the forces supporting the crown because at this point in time he hated Aerys probably as much as most of the rebels. Aerys stole Tywin's heir, Jaime, from him and he was never willing to forgive for that. However, it is precisely because Jaime was a member of the Kingsguard that Tywin would not combine his forces with that of the rebels. As stated in the Wiki, the moment Jaime became a member of the Kingsguard Tywin understood that Aerys was making Jaime a hostage. The only time he was willing to act was when the war was decided and his son, and heir, would be safe. 

&gt; Tywin's friends are also plotting against him due to his ruthlessness, including Littlefinger, Varys, and the Tyrells. They are constantly plotting against him

This was the criticism that frustrated me the most about the other post. Since when is Littlefinger, Varys, the Tyrells, or ANYONE outside of the Westernlands considered Tywin's friends? The other post stated that these forces plotting against him would be the downfall of his house. The real reason these forces will plot against House Lannister is for one reason and one reason alone, **power**. Power is a finite quantity, and due almost exclusively to Tywin's skill the Lannisters had amassed an obscene amount of it. If we know anything about Littlefinger, the Tyrells (mainly Mace), or most of the houses in the realm is that they desire more power. The only way to do that is to take it from those who have it, the Lannisters. 

Now I would like to address the criticisms levied against Tywin that were completely valid. They are these three:

* Fortuitous elimination of Renly
* Treatment of Tyrion
* Failure's of his command during the War of Five Kings

First of all, as I stated in a comment on another post, had it not been for Melisandre's vajayjay voodoo Renly would have taken the Throne. Renly had basically all of the Stormlands and the Reach backing his claim and commanded a force of 100,000 men. However, Renly's untimely demise benefited *everyone* else in the war, not just Tywin. Renly had every intention of marching on the North if Robb didn't yield to his claim.

Tywin's biggest failure as a commander also occurs during the War of the Five Kings. To be fair, however, before Robb marched South Tywin had routed the Riverlands and taken Riverrun under his command. However, Tywin subsequently made several miscalculations, and even more grievously underestimated the military command of Robb Stark. As has been analyzed at length Robb proved himself to be an exceptional military tactician. From the Battle of the Whispering Wood, to his sacking of the West to set up a trap for Tywin. Ironically, it was the successful campaign of Edmure that caused Tywin to march South and ruin Robb's plan. Robb's ultimate failure lied in his inability to see the consequences of his actions longterm. This is where many people say Tywin got lucky to survive the war. I would posit to you that luck had **nothing** to do with it. Robb's biggest mistakes were marrying Jeyne, which lost him the Freys, and beheading Rickard Karstark. An effective leader/commander knows how to keep his allies happy and *loyal*. If Tywin switched shoes with Robb would he have married a woman that would cost him the Twins? Would he have beheaded one of his most powerful vassal lords whom was essential to him winning the war? The answer to those questions is unequivocally no. Robb Stark's failure seemed inevitable because, while he was immensely gifted as a warrior and military commander, he lacks the political savvy and cunning to lead. Tywin then basically ended the rebellion from the North with his pen from King's Landing. Not only did he orchestrate the Red Wedding, but he avoided any blame for it. The ""credit"" was subsequently laid upon Roose Bolton and the Frays. 

Tywin's biggest weakness in my opinion is his attitude towards Tyrion. By all accounts Tywin was madly in love, and even happy, with his wife Joanna. The fact that she died giving birth to Tywin created in him a blinding hatred that overcame his normally astute judgment. As Genna said to Jaime at the Riverlands:

&gt; Tyrion is Tywin's son, not you. I said so once to your father's face, and he would not speak to me for half a year. 

I believe Tywin always saw himself in Tyrion, but Joanna's death, in accordance with Tyrion's actions constantly tainting the family name (whoring and drinking) made Tywin loathe Tyrion. Despite that hatred, it was on Tywin's order that Tyrion was named Hand and sent to King's Landing to restore order during the war. That in and of itself is proof that Tywin trusted Tyrion's judgment. His greatest weakness however is that he could never acknowledge the genius of his youngest son, if he had then the legacy he created may have survived his death. 

Is Tywin a Demi-God that some present him to be? HELL NO. Is Tywin perfect in his judgment? Absolutely not. However, if we judge someone's legacy in GRRM's world as leaving his house in better order than they inherited it, than the **Bottom Line** is this: *Very few people in the history of the series wielded power as effectively as Lord Tywin Lannister*

Tywin inherited a House in ruins and raised it to become the wealthiest and most powerful house in the Seven Kingdoms. He successfully married his family into the blood royal. Then through a bloody civil war that cost his House dearly, he secured his Grandson's hold on the Iron Throne.

* God Emperor of Dune (1981)
* Heretics of Dune (1984)
* Chapterhouse: Dune (1985)

    Average wait - 4 years

My all-time favorite series had wait times similar to ASOIAF even though it did speed up toward the end and I personally was too young to endure the dry years.  However, years after the original author died, his son, Brian Herbert, collaborated with Kevin J Anderson to write more books into the franchise including ""[Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007) – based on notes left behind by Frank Herbert for what he referred to as Dune 7, his own planned seventh novel in the Dune series.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapterhouse_Dune#Sequels).""  IMHO, this is an example of how a series can be continued after an author has passed, but because the follow-up authors lack the subtely of the original author, the franchise continues telling the framework of the story with degraded quality.  The cash must flow.

* Mostly Harmless (published in 1992)

    Average wait - 3.25 years

The average wait time in this ""Increasingly Inaccurately Named Hitchhiker's Trilogy"" is certainly shorter than our wait for The Others, but I included it as an example of the time between books progressively becoming longer.  The long time between Douglas's last books personally caused the wait to feel more unbearable between each book, much like George RR is increasingly doing to us.  The series does also have a post mortem book, ""And Another Thing..."" written by another team of authors, which I have not read and will not comment on, but has received good reviews so may end up being an example of how a franchise can have its quality continue after its creator has passed.

    Author made us wait 

    And did not space evenly 
    
    The time between books 


The quality of Clavell's novels did not suffer for the time between releases, but was probably hard to take just like waiting for the ASOIAF is now.

The Vampire Chronicles - Anne Rice

* Interview with the Vampire (1976)
* The Vampire Lestat (1985)
* The Queen of the Damned (1988)
* The Tale of the Body Thief (1992)
* Memnoch the Devil (1995)
* The Vampire Armand (1998)
* Merrick (2000)
* Blood and Gold (2001)
* Blackwood Farm (2002)
* Blood Canticle (2003)

    Average wait - 3 years

God bless her, Ms Rice actually shortened the wait time between books as she went.  As a series gains popularity and more fans are introduced to it (much like ASOIAF is experiencing now), the clamor for sequels increases.  The Vampire Chronicles actually sated its fans with sequels being produced closer together, allowing the series to snowball into something that I actually got tired of reading and had to take a decade-long break from because I had ""author fatigue"".

Scott Pilgrim - Bryan Lee O'Malley
Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life (August 18, 2004)
Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (June 15, 2005)

Scott Pilgrim's Finest Hour (July 20, 2010)

Technically graphic novels and compared to the rest of this list have very short wait times between editions, but I am including this as an example of what happens when a written series is not completed before the the screen adaptation is made, as I suspect will happen with HBO's A Game of Thrones.  O'Malley [had not finished writing the final installment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World#Development) before production on the film had started.  He instead gave the director, Edgar Wright, his notes and wrote in tandum with the film team.  In the DVD commentary both O'Malley and Wright state that they played off of each other and the book version actually changed because O'Malley borrowed from the film screen play (I don't have a source link for this, watch it yourself).  Will we get to the point that HBO's AGOT needs to begin work on the final season before the final ASOIAF book is realease?  At the current pace, yes, and hopefully some arrangement can be made to benifit both the book and the show.
===============================================


I think that Martin taking his time between releases benefits the books but will ultimately hurt the screen adaptation, especially if he holds his cards too close to his chest and does not allow artistic license to be taken by HBO for unfinished work.  If the unfortunate worst case scenerio happens and we lose Martin before his novels are finished, can we find another person or team to take over and continue in the spirit of the original?  Yes, but I think it is more likely that a Herbert/Anderson pair is more likely that will give us fluff to close out the series.

1373611618.0,150,self.asoiaf,1i50h8,(Spoilers All) Examining the nature of mapmaking and climate in 'Planetos',cedargrove,172,22,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1i50h8/spoilers_all_examining_the_nature_of_mapmaking/,"The map that we have of Westeros/Essos/etc is not meant to be perfectly accurate.  GRRM has said that the maps are the work of the Maesters and this is part of the reason why Essos and the rest of the world is not mapped well.

I was always bothered by how rectangular the map of Westeros is, as if GRRM tried to fill up a piece of paper and was confined by the edges.  It didn't dawn on me until very recently that this may have been a conscious choice.  Here is a replica of the canon map from The Land of Ice and Fire:

http://i36.photobucket.com/albums/e4/Werthead/Maps/WorldofIceandFireNamesandScale_zps2aecc8fb.png

Now compare the shape of Westeros to old maps of Europe/Asia/Africa:

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Anglo-Saxon_World_Map_Corrected.png

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/TabulaRogeriana_upside-down.jpg

This is an example that includes a more complete picture.  But notice how exaggerated everything starts to get towards the east.  The proportions of the Arabian Peninsula, India, the general coast line are stretched out.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/TabulaRogeriana_upside-down.jpg

The previous map is distorted partially because it's meant for sea navigation and it probably served its purpose well enough at the time.  The thing is, accurate map making is really hard.  It took us a long time to get good at it.  Clearly the Maesters knowledge of the planet itself is lacking as there appears to have been no circumnavigation or true understanding of the planets latitude/longitude.

I would wager that the map is highly inaccurate.  To look for proof I would be interested to find references to the amount of time it took to get from any place to any other place, especially by sea.  For instance, looking at the canon map if you went from Gulltown to Braavos, how long does that take compared to say Sunspear to Tyrosh.  Obviously there are some islands in the way and who is to guess about the currents, but if GRRM wanted to hint at certain inaccuracies this would be a way to do it.  

I think if we had a GPS view of Planetos it would be very, very interesting but I think we need to be cautious of what we know about the map and how it affects the characters.  Specifically there is the Quaithe prediction with the 'you must go east to go west'.  Yeah on the map it looks like a stupid idea because it's such a long way to go east but maybe it's not as far as it appears.

For instance, look at this map from 1570 and compare the size of North America to the size of Asia.  The land with less known about it is exaggerated in size.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/OrteliusWorldMap1570.jpg

What I'm currently having a problem with are the names of three areas:  The Land of Always Winter, The Shadowlands, and the Sunset sea.

We know the seasons on 'Planetos' are to some extent due to magic.  I know GRRM has said something to the effect of 'it's a fantasy novel' the answer probably isn't going to be some complex solar system situation.  I still think, however, that there are clues in the geography.

Let's assume you can sail West from Westeros and you would eventually arrive on the East coast of Essos.  So you would travel over the Sunset Sea (yes I know the sun sets in the West) and arrive in the Shadowlands.  

I grew up in a place that felt like it was always winter and suffered from a lack of sunlight, Alaska.  I'm definitely not the first to suggest a possible connection between the land south of Asshai and the Land of Always Winter, just saying that a lack of sunlight and cold are very connected.

I don't believe the distance between Asshai and the LoAW is very close if this is the case.  All of the land that is on the general latitude of Asshai/Summer Islands is very tropical in nature.  Sothoryos is supposed to be some plague ridden jungle with a bunch of ruined cities and apparently no one lives there anymore.  That whole region doesn't sound like it's very close to a land or residence of beings who make it always cold.

GRRM has said that Planetos is bigger than Earth, and while its seasons are magical, I think we can assume there is some sort of polar structure here.  If the southern most part of the map appears to be rather tropical/arid, then I think we have one of two possible scenarios:

1.  The southern portion of the map is, in relation to our planet, sub-equatorial and there is a good bit of land south of it before it either gets cold or wraps around towards the LoAW.

2.  The reason that so little is known, and why so few people live in Sothoryos and Ulthos, is because there is a region of continuous extreme heat analogous to the LoAW.  This could mean that the world is pretty damn big and that one pole is extremely hot while the other is extremely cold.

Taking the idea further, we could confirm this polarity if there were some stories from the areas not on the southern portion of the map.  Perhaps they had a Long Day at the same time as the Long Night.  Though I worry this starts getting into more technical territory and less magical territory.  This type of setup would require that Planetos have an axial setup like Uranus where instead of it's rotation moving in an 'east to west' setup, it moves 'north to south' and it would require an orbit like the moon's where one pole is always generally facing the star and the other is facing away.

I think the above, however, is not what GRRM is planning to reveal.

So why the huge discrepancy in season lengths and in world temperatures?  There are some clues in the Red Waste and Dothraki sea I believe.  There is mention that the Red Waste has been growing and swallowing up cities and that the Dothraki sea is turning brown and that the grasses are shrinking.  Perhaps the cause of this (and it has been going on for sometime in the case of the Red Waste) is related to the return of a strong winter in Westeros.  The focus is always on winter and it's affects, and the summers in Westeros are always seen as a good thing, but I think we may overlook what the summers are doing to another part of the world.

Not sure how I feel about this idea but I'll go ahead and throw it out, I'm sure it's been covered elsewhere.  If the Others are said to possibly bring the cold with them, and that it feels colder around each individual Other, mayhaps the Great Other is some tangible entity or force, which when it moves about the LofAW it takes winter with it, allowing the Others to move in a certain 'radius' of the Great Other?  For you Starcraft players the Great Other could be basically laying some creep for the Others to move on.  If the Great Other does exist in some tangible form, and it's truly great, maybe you need a 700ft magical wall to keep the damn thing out of Westeros.

On the other side, R'hollor could be a similar manifestation, wandering about the opposite pole taking heat/drought/death with it as well.  If this is the case we just really don't know much about the southern portions of the map.  Maybe R'hollor and the Great Other are constantly fighting, pushing each other back and then losing ground, causing the seasons to fluctuate.  If R'hollor is real it could mean it is losing in some sense and requires the use of humans (akin to Greek mythology) to fight back.  Thus the return of humans ability to use magic.  It sounds weird but if the Great Other is making use of dead human bodies then it too, for whatever reason despite how powerful it is, needs the assistance of human form to exert his will.

For me this brings up a whole host of other questions.  Where do the Children of the Forest fit in?  Why, as far as we know, are the CotF only on/near Westeros?  Is there some analogue to them on Sothoryos or Ulthos?  We just know so little about history outside of Westeros that it's really hard to get a sense of the whole picture.  What happened to the cities on Sothoryos?  I suppose that could answer a lot.  What truth is there, or what is the actual story behind the Second Moon myth?  I don't believe that dragons are actually from the Moon, but I assume there is something more to that story.  What makes the shadow lands so shadowy?  Literal lack of light?  Smoking embers?  Could an eclipse be the shadow Quaithe refers to?  How does the Doom of Valyria fit in?  What kicked off the Winter and how much did it have to do with humans?  

It's late and I could keep rambling on.  I'll probably edit and add more in the morning, just had a bunch of thoughts and wanted to get them out before I slept.  Thanks for reading.

Well, someone over at Tower of the Hand posted an account of what transpired [here](http://towerofthehand.com/blog/2013/05/27-conquest-44-report-grrm/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TowerOfTheHand+(Tower+of+the+Hand). Here are the main points.

1. ""Princess and the Queen"" is 30K words and will take place during the time period of the original Dance of the Dragons.

2. GRRM wrote 250K words for The World of Ice and Fire (Originally, it was supposed to be around 50K.)


3. Interesting information about S02E09 (Blackwater) that I won't quote in length, but it's there if you're interested.

4. No big shocker, but they are casting for **Oberyn Martell** for S04(!!) as well as Styr, Magnar of Thenn and Mace Tyrell 

5.  **Confirmation of a Theory on Varys** - This I consider the biggest thing from the Convention. Here's the quote from Tower of the Hand.

 &gt; Varys' little birds do have their tongues cut out. They are ""provided to him"" that way.

Anyways, that's what I got from the article.

I have been wondering about this subreddit's view of R+L=J.  Specifically, I am curious to know how many people came up with this theory on their own, versus learned about the theory through friends or on the internet.  

Basically, this survey is to explore if this is a very obvious theory to people, or if it is better shrouded than would be apparent from discussions on this subreddit.  If I get enough responses, I'll take a good look at the data and make a post with some results!

Thanks for taking the time to participate!

EDIT: thanks for the suggestions.  A couple points and updates

1) This survey has nothing to do with an endorsement of the theory.  It doesn't matter if you believe in R+L=J or not, this is simply about when you learnt about the theory's existence.

2) That being said, I've added a third question asking if you do believe in the theory, since that was highly requested

3) I've also added a new answer choice to question 1, in case you had a suspicion that something was up but used the help of others to figure it out.
