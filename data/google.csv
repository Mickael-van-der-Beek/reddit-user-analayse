She's submitted an appeal a few times with no reply whatsoever (Google apparently just doesn't reply if an appeal is denied).  

In the meantime, she's lost access to all her Gmail (her primary method of contact with banks, employers, etc.), her Google voice, her Gchat account... everything.  Her life is essentially on hold because of it.

And there's plenty more where that came from.... 

I guess this is really just a warning to backup your Google account as the side bar recommends, because it seems that once suspended, regardless of validity, your account is gone for good.

1363281695.0,285,self.google,1aamc3,Google is lying. Reader still has MILLIONS of active users. Stats inside.,Jordan117,438,153,166,http://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1aamc3/google_is_lying_reader_still_has_millions_of/,"If you click the detail view of a Reader feed, it will show you the current number of subscribers. You can also see subscriber counts in the Recommended list, or on a feed search.

The number of subscribers is staggering even for sites I'd never heard of, larger than some countries:

&gt;Engadget: 6,604,967

&gt;CNET News: 1,663,104

&gt;The Big Picture: 761,743

&gt;Ars Technica: 28,350

&gt;The Onion: 499,915

&gt;Order of the Stick: 34,497

&gt;TheKitchn.com: 686,512

&gt;xkcd: 324,329

&gt;Cyanide &amp; Happiness: 108,458

&gt;Lifehacker: 55,627

&gt;Cool Tools: 201,264

&gt;Penny Arcade: 183,586

I thought maybe it was a legacy thing, like these sites racked up tens or hundreds of thousands of subscribers years ago when Reader was popular but the service now has far fewer active users. And yet:

&gt;The Verge (launched November 2011): 102,756

&gt;xkcd's What If? (launched July 2012): 71,811

Also, Buzzfeed recently published statistics showing that Google Reader delivers orders of magnitude more traffic than Google Plus -- [between 10 and 25 million hits per *month*](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/google-reader-still-sends-far-more-traffic-than-google). That's a significant fraction of Facebook's total traffic the same time period (10-35%).

Judging from these stats, Google Reader is not stagnant or neglected. **Reader has millions of active users**. And Google is fucking all of them over, hard.

**EDIT:** According to blog [Google Operating System](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2013/03/google-reader-data-points.html):

- most popular feed (CNN) has more than 24 million subscribers

- Google's official feed has more than tripled its subscription base since 2007

- 87% of GOS readers come from Google Reader

- According to Google Trends, search interest in Google Reader climbed steadily throughout 2008, 2009, 2010 and plateaued in 2011, seeing only a slight decline (plateauing at 2009 levels) only after they fucked up its social sharing systems.",,False,,t5_2qh45,1363287614.0,,,True,t3_1aamc3,http://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1aamc3/google_is_lying_reader_still_has_millions_of/,

* The redesign of the web services that happened around the time of the Google+ launch looks great. I was one of the people moaning about getting less gmail on my screen at first, but now I'm accustomed to it I wouldn't go back. The design right across their products from search to gmail to Google+ looks sleek, modern and organised.

* The recent versions of Android, particularly ICS and JB look fantastic. Although different to the web services, it's clear that they have started with the same principles of clean, modern design. 

* The Google apps for iOS, particularly the Google Search and Google+ apps are some of the nicest looking on the platform. Chrome on the iPad makes Safari look like an OS 9 app!

At the same time Apple seem to be going backwards:

* iOS apps are looking quite dated now, grey with blue, shaded buttons looked nice on the original iPhone, but look tacky compared to the sleek, flat elements that Google uses.

* I really dislike the leather and wood type UIs on Contacts, Calendar, Pages, etc.

* iTunes on OS X and Windows looks like it should have had a complete redesign about 5 years ago.

* OS X is one of the better products from Apple in terms of design, but even Lion is beginning to look dated. Far too grey, the window widgets look very 2005 era, some of the icons (Finder springs to mind) look very poor.

I understand that this is all very subjective, and some of the things that I dislike are liked by the majority of users.

About a week ago I attempted to log into my Gmail account and was prompted with a page saying my account was disabled.  I assumed it must have been a mistake (or that I had been hacked) but that it should be something that could be fixed easily.  Not so.  I've tweeted Google, filled in their account recovery form (about 4 times now), and even tried calling members of the Gmail team at Google.  I have had no success
with any on them, nor any response as to why my account was  mysteriously deleted.  This Gmail account was HUGELY important to me for a number of reasons.

-I receive ALL of my emails there.  If I lose/forget a password, the recovery email is sent there.

-I receive my banking statements there.

-I was recently sharing a number of Google Docs for business and personal use.  My sisters wedding song list (which was of great importance to her, and a significant amount of work) is now gone...just gone.  She can't even access it.

-All of my contacts were tied to my account. I've lost emails, phone numbers, etc.

-My Android phone can now no longer access Applications I have paid for in the Google Market, nor can it do anything Google related (kinda important...)

-My AdWords, AdSense, Blogger, and YouTube accounts are no longer.

-And so much more....(I even had the perfect GReader setup!)

-CD Keys emailed to me (VMWare, etc.)

All of it gone with no explanation.  There's no one to contact; my entire Google existence is gone.  It's quite frustrating.  I used to love using all that Google had to offer, but now I simply can't trust them to delete everything I have.  :(


Here's to starting at square 1 again.


**_Edit_**
I've had some additional thoughts since my original post.  

Google asks us to put a great amount of faith into them, and their services.  Through various methods we trust Google with everything from our money (Google Checkout, Adwords/Adsense) to GPS (Navigation on Google Android).  We trust them with our daily e-communication (Gmail, GTalk, GVoice, GDocs), our open thoughts (Blogger, Google Sites), our cherished moments (Picasa, Youtube), and for all of our patronage (netting them billions of dollars in profit) we get zero goodwill in return.  Sure, %99 percent of people won't be * perceived * by Google as in violation their TOS, which is great.  For the %1 however, their lives...depending on how much they trusted Google....their lives could be ruined.  It's like a bad movie plot where the main actor is deleted from the system, only it is happening to you.  You don't know why you can't access your old photos (which, when your hard drive crashed, assumed would be safe in Googles hands) or why you can't call old friends because you happened to buy a new droid (again you were relying on the handy 'sync contacts' feature).  You only know you've been deleted. 

I was going to write a 'worst case scenario' ... but there are so many; here is one that comes to mind.  Imagine you planned a month long vacation in Google Doc's with your best friends. You had reservation information for hotels, flights, trains, and even bike rentals....but now you can't remember which hotel you decided to go with in the second week. You can't remember if you were biking in France, Belgium, Sweden, or Greece, let alone what day.  And now you'll never know....I dunno.  This is just one of many shitty circumstances that could arise from sudden Google deprivation.  When Google asks for people to put their trust into them, couldn't we at least talk to a human?  I've had issues with small and large companies alike, and I've always been able to resolve it.  If I can talk to a human at Facebook, IBM, or even a little little startup like Hipmonk...Google should certainly be able to provide the same service.  Really, it's an amateur issue to have.

**1. No contact list.**

I really don't understand this one. I can sort of understand the stateless, any device, no need to know if someone is offline/online bullshit they're trying to do, but I really can't fathom why you wouldn't include a contact list. Even Facebook let's you create a favorites list. 

**2. Can't launch voice only calls.**

If I'm on 3G on my phone or I just don't want someone to see me, why can't I do a voice only call? Didn't they literally create the XMPP standard for this?

**3. Can't view or set status/status messages (except the little green bar when you're already talking to someone).**

What kind of idiot would remove this feature? Literally every IM program since ICQ has had this. I understand they're trying to have a sort of stateless messaging service, but you can have it both ways, just by adding an option to view or not view statuses. 

**4. All outbound chat appears in the sent mail folder in Gmail.**

Is this by design or just a bug?

**5. No SMS.**

There is a Gmail Labs SMS feature and Google Voice's SMS feature, but it doesn't incorporate either of them.

**6. No Google Voice integration.**

I had to switch back to Google Talk in Gmail to get this working again. 

**7. Chat history is compltely broken.**

Let me explain, if you haven't noticed it yourself. 

Let's say Bob messaged me on Google Talk at 1/1/2010 - 3:30 PM.

(Open chat window)

1/1/2010 3:30 Bob: Hi Grayone.

1/1/2010 3:31 Me: Hi Bob.

1/1/2010 3:32 Me: Sorry Bob I have to go.

(Close chat window)

This chat would appear in Gmail, under the chats folder as a single entry, like this:

""Chat with Bob (3 Lines) Jan 1 2010""

After Hangouts has been introduced every chat I've had with Bob during the last few weeks shows up as one entry, ""Hangout with Bob"". It's an infinitely scrolling list. I thought I could break it up by pressing ""Archive Hangout"", but even though archiving the hangout creates another ""Hangout with Bob"" entry in the chats folder, it's still the same infinitely scrolling list.

This is a really bad design. Let's say I want to see a chat with Bob I had in 2008, I can search Gmail for ""subject:chat bob after:2008/1/1 before:2009/1/1"". The results will look like this:

""Chat with Bob (44 Lines) Jan 27 2008"" 

""Chat with Bob (231 Lines) Feb 4 2008""

""Chat with Bob (10 Lines) April 2 2008""

Etc...

In a Google Hangout world, my entire seven year history of chats with Bob would show up like this:

""Hangout with Bob""

If I wanted to see a chat that I had with Bob in 2005, I would have to keep scrolling up for what could literally be hours depending on how many chats we had. 

It would be really, really, easy for them to fix this - they could call it legacy mode. They can present the new dumbed down experience and you if you like it, great for you, but if you're a corporate user or a power user, click a button and have it turn back into an actual IM client.

At this point, besides the video chat, most IM clients circa 1998 are more functional then Google Hangouts. They totally fucked this up. ",,False,,t5_2qh45,1370237272.0,,,True,t3_1fjzix,http://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1fjzix/seven_reasons_why_hangouts_suck/,

I was un-disabled thanks to [Sarah Price's](http://www.reddit.com/user/sarahprice/) superb sleuthing for my original disabled email and her subsequent re-enabling it.  She is the community manager for Gmail from what her G+ account says, and I think she's made a new Reddit account just for this.  I very much appreciate her coming here and taking care of my issue.  While she's here, I would like to talk more about the experience. 

I don't want to bite the hand that just gave my my email back, but I hardly think every individual who gets their account disabled will have such an opportunity (unless Google starts /r/GoogleSupport ;) at having their problem fixed.  I also believe many Gmail users are 1 virus/bastard friend/evil coworker/accident away from having their account disabled. As I stated in my last post, I am quite dependent of Google Services (to my downfall). So I would like to suggest some things that would make getting an account disabled suck less.  I am writing with the assumption that an account was disabled for reasons other than a suspected hacking.

1.  If you disable my account, can I at least have my data?  If I enter a correct username and password but have had my account disabled I think it would be reasonable to have a Google Takeout file ready.  This would satisfy my greatest 'oh shit' reaction of thinking all of my data is gone forever.

2. Rather than bouncing emails sent to the disabled account in question, could Google set-up an auto-reply saying the account has been disabled?  Or, better yet, if a user enters a correct username and password could they fill in a forwarding address that will last for 1 week so they may change over all the accounts they had forwarded there?

3. Is there a way to only disable a specific service?  I don't like the idea of having my android disabled because something happened with Google+.  

4. Could Google have some sort of chat service set-up for customer service?  I know I'm asking a lot of a free service, but it was next to impossible for me to speak to a human who could help.


I'm sure there's more, but this is what comes to mind immediately. To Redditor's who see this, please be sure to use Google Takeout, Sync your e-mail to Thunderbird, and [more](http://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/ikvq6/how_important_is_your_data_in_your_google_account/). I'm still the same Google fanboy, but I'll be sure to not make the same mistake twice (and not be an idiot with my browser). Thank you again Sarah, and thank you Reddit.

Unfortunately Google could not find where the money went, and Google did not send me the SWIFT payment receipt before Christmas for me to be able to find where it went. 

Though we didn't mind a skinnier than usual Christmas, now that the holiday has passed, I would really appreciate that someone at Google would contact me about this issue, which I consider serious by now, as my bank has replied with final confirmation that this amount never made it here, I have all this in writing, in case Google thinks I'm trying to cash the payment twice(I think you think that, because your support message says ""you received it, period""). 

This is my real name and my Google Gmail account is 8 years old, my AdSense account is probably 5 or 6 years old, you know who I am and this is my verified identity and if you check my Gmail you probably even know what meds I take. Nothing sketchy going on here - I just need your matter-of-fact help about a real issue.

**In every international SWIFT transaction a message receipt is generated. I need Google to provide me with this receipt as to where exactly you sent my payment.**

**I need a human being at Google, not the self-help robots,** to look into this, as I've been trying through the latter since earlier in December without any success. I've gone the automated self-help route, it did not work for this case, but I am unable to escalate it to a superior, thus the public contact.

tl;dr; A payment worth a few thousands of dollars has gone missing, I had plans for my family on Christmas, I bought them U$ nothing in presents without this payment. We're happy with that, there's always next year, but now I need someone with a good soul at Google to help me find the payment. I know Googlers read this forum, so this has become my next contact form, I have no other way to contact you.

    Payment Number	3579468971
    Account Nickname 	Citibank N.A. (I don't have an account at Citibank)
    Account Number	******45 (I don't nor did ever have an account ending in 45 ANYWHERE)

The bank has finished their search for the money and it's not here. Only the SWIFT message receipt will tell us where the money went.

Also, to Googlers I will gladly notify all of Reddit once you send me this SWIFT receipt and once Google helps me solve this issue and we find out exactly what happened. My intent is not to demote Google but to receive my honestly earned payment, which I'm sure Google did pay, we just need to find out where it was paid to, surely it wasn't here. **We need the SWIFT payment receipt, urgently.**

Thank you very much in advance for your help, Reddit. I hope we can grab some Googler's attention.

**Edit 12:33 AM local time** : I have received contact from Google here on Reddit. Not specifically from AdSense, but kind soul who offered help. Reddit has helped me reach them! I will keep you posted, not only out of fairness for Google's support(and to make sure it's all transparent) but also so others here can know how to deal with this if/when it happens to them. I'm keeping my hopes alive that this payment is not lost.

**Edit 12:45**: It's getting late here. Pardon if I don't reply any messages immediately, will check first thing after I log back in tomorrow. 

**Edit 10 AM**: A Google source has updated me on the case here via Reddit, they have a case open and are looking into the matter. Which only leaves the question: Is there anything Reddit can't do?! Google listened to us. I will keep you all posted, perhaps a follow-up post after this is sorted out.

If other people want to use this page to get an invite, post inside saying ""yes please"" or the like.  People with google+ invites PM the people in this post.  Once you receive your invite, delete or down vote and ~~strikethrough~~ your post so others can see you're good.

Edit:  Those sending invites, reply to those you send it to so other senders can see that they are 'in the works'.

Edit2: Those sending invites should also look for the oldest posts to give their invites to.

Edit3: PLEASE PLEASE upvote so we can get more attention.  Doesn't look like anybody is getting invites (yet).  (Don't worry, its a self post, no karma for the unworthy me)

Edit4:  I like sixth_degree's [suggestion](http://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/id7pg/want_google_lets_start_a_thread_that_makes_sense/c22tfkl): if you get an invite here, you owe at least two back here.  

**UPDATE**:  I got an invite, but it took me to a 404 page with a sad robot.  I looks like we're maxing out the total number of slots available.  Best advice for now be patient... 

**QUESTION**: has anybody gotten in using an invite?  I'm wondering if Google has capped the system ore something.

**UPDATE2**:  After 2 invites, I'm still getting the sad/broken robot 404 page.  I'm guessing that google has capped the number of users.  Anybody having luck getting in (reply [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/id7pg/want_google_lets_start_a_thread_that_makes_sense/c22twm3))?  

**FINAL UPDATE** (for now): I am calling it folks, this idea is dead.  Looks like google has everything locked down and no more users can be added.  If you still want invites feel free to post and hopefully people will remember this thread when they open it back up.  If you don't want an invite, delete or downvote and ~~strikethrough~~ your post.  Thanks for all the orangereds!  

**FINAL UPDATE 2.0** I am IN!  I will be sending PM's to those I deem worthy (been here for hours).  Please pay it forward

**FINAL UPDATE 2.1**  About to leave work for the weekend.  When I get back here on Monday, most of you had better be ~~strikethrough~~! (angry dad face)  I hope this keeps working!  PAY IT FORWARD!  



**DOWN VOTE STRUCK THROUGH POSTS TO GET THEM OFF THE PAGE**

or

**DELETE YOUR POST ONCE YOU GET A GOOGLE+ ACCOUNT**



Open to suggestions also.  Thanks,

Sorry if I promised you a penny and never delivered. **I will not be sending out any more until a future time**. I am also going to create a better system for sending out invites. Thanks you all for your kindness to me.

**EDIT 6**: Sorry about yesterday not getting caught up. Work has given me a few projects that are urgent so I haven't had time to focus on sending out pennies to you fine folk. I will get through them and send them! No need to worry!

**EDIT5**: I got caught up from everyone that sent one last night (or so I think) and if you didn't get it, even though you PM'd me your Gmail then please PM me again with your Gmail. Only if you haven't received a penny from me yet. Thanks guys for your kind words as well. I appreciate such positive attitudes!

**EDIT 4**: I am going to bed so I will get those that I missed tonight tomorrow morning! **Keep sending the PM's in** and I'll keep sending the invites out! I'm not even close to done yet! :)

**EDIT 3**: I'm going to keep sending these as I get them! I'll probably start gearing down for the night to catch sufficient zzzz's but **I shall resume sending pennies in the morning and throughout tomorrow!** Keep 'em coming! I want to give all of you Gold but it takes forever to type in all my card info over and over so I'll start slowing down on that as well but **more gold is on the way**!

**EDIT 2**: I just want to emphasize, I have no limit on how many I'll send out so even if you see this post a week later shoot me a PM and I'll make it happen! Hell, if your friends and family need invites send me multiple Gmail's to invite! :D

**EDIT 1**: Sorry for delaying getting some of these out. I've got a queue of about 50 to go through (and more coming!) so it might take a few! But please send em all in! No time limit or money limit for when I'll stop doing this so just send away.

Basically I'll send you a penny through Gmail and when you accept the penny you will have the option to send money through Gmail from then on out.

Please just PM me your email and make sure to **type the whole thing** (@gmail.com) and please only PM me for one if you are **in the USA** as it is currently only available here. I will continue to send these out for as long as I get PM's regarding them. It might take me **up to 24 hours** to send it as I have work during the day.

Of course it'd be awesome for you to pay it forward and once your in, invite your friends and family.

",crimpy,242,70,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/yjk4w/google_places_has_deleted_my_business_listing/,"I am a property inspector in KY.  For 3 years I've worked my ass off to be the #1 rated inspector in my area on Google.  I did it, and the beginning of the year business and life were good.  Until around May. 

I noticed a decline in the number of calls I was getting.  No biggie, everyone has down a week.  That week turned into 2....hmmm.  I start to investigate and find that my ""Places"" or ""Map"" listing is gone. Not dropped to page 2, or 3.  Gone. The link I've had on my website for the past 2 years to my Google reviews now takes you to some business in Ireland with a similar name.  WTF?

I submit the ticket to Google and a few weeks go by, and I get this email: 



*Hello,

Thanks for getting in touch with us about your listing not showing. 

Unfortunately, your listing may have been dropped due to a technical issue that we cannot yet resolve. We hope to have a resolution soon for this issue, at which point we will be in touch with next steps to help you return your business to Google Maps.

Best,
The Google Team*




My listing is still not showing up.  It's now been almost 3 months, and my business is down 200%.  I heading into the slow part of the year and I don't think I'll make it through the winter.  Not many people buy houses in the winter.

The weird part is, if I login in to my account I can see, edit, and change all my info, it even says it's ""ACTIVE"".  But the user only see's a screen that says:

**We currently do not support the location.**

I've done all the little tricks like clicking edit and submit to try to ""refresh"" the listing.  Nope. 

I know it's a long shot, but if anyone out there has any tips, or even knows someone at Google, I'd be forever in their debt. 


**EDIT:**

So everyone understands.  My site is #1 in organic results, &amp; has a PR of 3.  Any variations of keyword searches I'm on top of the pile.  I did not take any black hat methods.  My website has not been dinged or flagged, ONLY my map listing and reviews have disappeared.  

I forgot to also say that Google fixed the problem in mid June for about a week, then it went right back down again. :(


**EDIT-2:**

I was reluctant to post the URL, but I'm desperate, and maybe someone can help.  [Here](http://abihomeservices.com)  Also, the Google link isn't to Ireland, it's some company in the UK, oops.

[Google CEO Larry Page explains reasoning behind Motorola acquisition (spoiler: patents)](http://www.bgr.com/2011/08/15/google-ceo-larry-page-explains-reasoning-behind-motorola-acquisition-spoiler-patents/)

**Official statement:**
Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: MMI) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Google will acquire Motorola Mobility for $40.00 per share in cash, or a total of about $12.5 billion, a premium of 63% to the closing price of Motorola Mobility shares on Friday, August 12, 2011. The transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. 

The acquisition of Motorola Mobility, a dedicated Android partner, will enable Google to supercharge the Android ecosystem and will enhance competition in mobile computing. Motorola Mobility will remain a licensee of Android and Android will remain open. Google will run Motorola Mobility as a separate business. 

Larry Page, CEO of Google, said, “Motorola Mobility’s total commitment to Android has created a natural fit for our two companies. Together, we will create amazing user experiences that supercharge the entire Android ecosystem for the benefit of consumers, partners and developers. I look forward to welcoming Motorolans to our family of Googlers.” 

Sanjay Jha, CEO of Motorola Mobility, said, “This transaction offers significant value for Motorola Mobility’s stockholders and provides compelling new opportunities for our employees, customers, and partners around the world. We have shared a productive partnership with Google to advance the Android platform, and now through this combination we will be able to do even more to innovate and deliver outstanding mobility solutions across our mobile devices and home businesses.” 

Andy Rubin, Senior Vice President of Mobile at Google, said, “We expect that this combination will enable us to break new ground for the Android ecosystem. However, our vision for Android is unchanged and Google remains firmly committed to Android as an open platform and a vibrant open source community. We will continue to work with all of our valued Android partners to develop and distribute innovative Android-powered devices.” 

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals in the US, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and the approval of Motorola Mobility’s stockholders. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2011 or early 2012.

Videos don't buffer very much, always pause, often break viewing entirely so that I have to reload the page, etc.

In short, in Chrome I feel like I'm on dialup and YouTube is a frustrating mess, frankly unusable. Works fine in every other browser.

I understand that it is a worthy effort to save wasted bandwidth, but theimplementation is abominable. For more than six months, I have been forced to copy and paste YouTube links into a different browser to watch because they simply do not work in Chrome; googling the problem, it seems to be very common.

How could an organization of Google's size, wealth, and intelligence commit such a glaring gaffe, and let it stand for so long?

Instructions:

* Create a circle called ""Invites"" (really could be called anything).
* Go to the ""Find and Invite"" tab on the ""Circles"" page.
* Drag everyone you want to invite into the newly created ""Invites"" circle.
* Go to your homepage and share something with the ""Invites"" circle only. Make sure to check the ""Also email X people not yet using Google+"".
* Click ""share""

That's it. Now all those people will get a Google+ invite! I have tested this with a few friends and it works!


If you want one just PM me, and I will use this method to get you one!


**Update 1:**


So to make my life easier, I will send out the invites in bulk in 1 hour.



**Update 2:**


I am cutting off invites now and am going to send them out. Fingers crossed for everyone who PM'ed me. Will update again when they've been sent!




**Update 3 (Final @ 12:45PM PST):**


I sent out the invites to the first 61 people who PMed me. Fingers crossed. Hopefully it works. It didn't look promising when I tried it out however. Anyone who PM'ed me after 12:20PM PST will not be invited. Its just too tedious to do. And I think they may have plugged this hole too. Alas it was worth an attempt. Best of luck in getting in guys!


**Update 4 (Final Final)**

I've been informed by some people that they are getting 404 errors when clicking on the invite link. Looks like it didn't work. Was a valiant attempt though!. Maybe try those links again in a few hours/days and see if it works again. Otherwise you'll just have to wait til Google opens it up for everyone! Sorry guys!


**Update 5 (modified)**

**44/100** have joined. Looks like some people are getting through! In light of this I sent the invitation again! Hopefully it works this time!


**Update 6 15:24 PST**

I sent out another batch of 40 invites (upvotes appreciated :-P). Its a serious pain in the butt to do this (parsing reddit inbox, copying emails, adding emails 1 by 1 in +). so forgive me if I don't do it again.

**Update 7 1600 PST**

Sent another 20 or so invites. approximately **50/120** people have gotten in!

**Update 8 1700 PST**

Sent 20 more!

**Update 9 2118 PST**

Approx **75/150** people have gotten in!


**Update 10 2141 PST**


Sent another **80** or so invites! Hopefully it works!",,False,,t5_2qh45,True,,,True,t3_idgh5,http://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/idgh5/google_invite_workaround/,

However, Ireland is part of the EU which means there is no import duty on products purchased from any store in the EU.  I'd love to be able to find all shops that stock something across the entire EU as it makes no difference to me if it's in Ireland or not when it comes to taxes etc.

A corollary to this would be to 'Find pages in the Eurozone' as it is likely that these sites will be using the Euro as currency. Again this means I won't have to pay cross border transaction fees to my bank if I purchase from these stores.

I type 90% of my projects on Docs but when I have bigger projects or something that requires a large amount of formatting I switch to LibreOffice.

There are a few things that Docs lacks. Minor things, sure, but they add up. Most of them have been added in rather recently but there are a few that I would still like to see.

* Page number formatting. There should be a way to have the second page count as page 1.

* The ability to make columns inside a document. You can make a grid with a width of 2 and set the line color to white, but I want a way to make columns like in Writer or Word.

* The find and replace function in Docs. You should be able to find all instances of a word and replace it with red font, larger font, italics, etc. Currently you can only replace a string with more plaintext.

* In Slides, there is no way to make white text with a black background. You have to have white text with black highlight behind it.

Besides that, Drive works great. I would switch over full time but I need the formatting power of Word or Writer for more complicated projects. What other features would you like to see added to Google Drive?

Sometimes when I'm writing an email I want to refresh my memory from other emails while I'm writing. In this case I middle/scroll-click the Google logo expecting a new tab to open, leaving my current tab quietly standing by waiting for me to tab back and finish my sentence - Instead, Gmail decides to Save my email as a draft, then close the email and return me to my inbox all in the same tab. Wtf?!

Also, middle clicking on a lot of the other links (Folders, Trash) just gives me mouse options or plain does nothing at all. Why can't I open my contacts in a new tab, why force me to stay in this tab?

Why must you break how my browser works, Google?!

",ttk2,146,34,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/191qks/the_chromebook_pixel_its_not_a_product_its_an/,"So who makes the Chromebook pixel? You may be tempted to respond ""Google you dunce!"" but that is exactly what I wish to draw attention to. 

Where is the manufacturing partner? Who is making that incredible screen? Where are these things being assembled? The answer to that question is at the same time simple and revolutionary, the answer is Google. 

Not Samsung, not LG, not Asus, not Acer, its Google all the way down. 

This first device we really saw made by Google was the Nexus Q. The Q was overpriced and under featured, but what it did have was hardware and build quality in quantities that you see in few if any other products. 

The Nexus Q was abandoned as a consumer product very quickly, it has been labeled as an immediate failure and forgotten. 

But the Nexus Q was not a failure, it was an exercise, meant for one thing and one thing only. To prove that Google design and manufacture its own devices. The Chromebook Pixel is merely step two, The Q showed that they could make a quality product, the Pixel shows that not only can they make a quality product they can make parts on the bleeding edge (the screen).

So if the Q was step one, and the Pixel step two, what is step three?

Glass, Google will manufacture Google Glass in house, in fact they are already manufacturing the explorer editions themselves.

Why are all three of these so expensive? To fund the development cost of building the production lines that are going to bring consumer electronics to the next level and to do so in America. They are not interested in selling a lot of any of these products, they are interested in selling just enough to test themselves. 

Google's current Nexus lineup is an attempt to provide high quality products as the sort of prices that make them irresistible to customers and strikes fear into competitors. What we are seeing now is the preparation to take that to the next level. 


I will call it here, in the next two years Google will be releasing products made in house priced as aggressively as the current Nexus line made in house and of, not high, but *unparalleled* quality.

They could easily become the largest independant movie and music producer in the country.

Ways that they could do this:

A.) Provide licenses for studio tools, and farm VM's for post production, CGI, etc. Basically anyone could rent enough processors to do high quality post-production work and CGI effects.

B.) Create, sell, and rent their own ""Red One"" camera, drive the cost of video even lower.

C.) Production equipment in a crate. Help you find techs you need, and ship a shipping container full of equipment to anywhere you need it.

D.) Market-place for crew, licenses you need, agents, actors, producers, directors. They could even do things like use google maps and street-view to get an idea of shoot locations, and provide contextual information such as ""Who you'd need to contact to fill out the forms to shoot here"", ""Local artists, crew, cast, etc.""

Post your email, get an invite, remove your email from the post (so other know not to invite you) and invite others. Repeat.

Faster we invite people, better shot it has of competing with Facebook.

EDIT: Seems like they closed out the invites again. I had the same thing when I got invited last week and had to check back every so often and wait for them to open up. Once they do open up, all you gotta do is go to plus.google.com and it should allow you to sign in. Nothing more I can do from this point on. If you got an invite, try to invite more people when it does open up. If you're still waiting, keep checking back. I'll try to open another thread like this when I notice that it's open again.

EDIT 2: Seems it might be back up now?!?! Either way, if you ever get an invite but get stopped for a ""keep me posted"" button, simply keep checking back later, it might take a week or more though (mine took a week).

EDIT 3: I'm off to bed for tonight. Seems there are a few people that are inviting others, consistently faster than I do it too. If they miss you by any chance, message me and I'll mass invite people tomorrow when I get a chance.

EDIT 4: Back from work. Invited everyone who didn't have an invite since I went to sleep yesterday. I'm done for now guys, my fingers hurt from inviting right now.

1325556863.0,92,self.google,o0jl6,Newly launched google.com/elections - I think this is a big hint of things to come,clvfan,127,35,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/o0jl6/newly_launched_googlecomelections_i_think_this_is/,"As a follower of both politics and Google, I found today’s launch of google.com/elections intriguing both from my sense as a political junkie and as an observer of Google’s business strategy.  The premise of the site is to be a US-centric election hub.  Clicking onto the main page highlights good utilization of Google’s services: news, [search trends – this one’s really cool](http://google.com/elections/ed/us/trends), [maps](http://google.com/elections/ed/us/ontheground), and [video](http://www.youtube.com/politics).  Even after all that there are two I consider even more significant: 1. Google has partnered with PBS to create a [2012 Political Calendar](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2012/calendar.html) which highlights the main events in the political season, powered of course by Google Calendar.  I can’t recall calendar being used quite in this context before (the most sophisticated use of calendar by 3rd parties currently is sporting events/scores imo).  It would be great if companies, event holders, etc. can create and share events - if only Google had some sort of social network… which brings me to significant event #2 - Google+.  Along with the election launch site came its Google+ page [Google Politics &amp; Elections](https://plus.google.com/114401727024677849167/posts).  

Now, I’m not sure if this entire thing is a play to bring Google+ an audience but the timing couldn’t be better.  You have a presidential election with a tremendously huge audience craving information and we know social networking is going to play a huge role in that.  I’m a big political junkie and I am so disappointed in Facebook and Twitter to follow my interest.  With Facebook, most of my friends/family aren’t overly political so hardly any discussion happens there.  When it does, mostly in some friend’s status comment thread, I find myself arguing with strangers and the whole situation just feels uncomfortable and out of place.  I don’t use Twitter but every time I visit the site it just seems like unorganized noise and a bunch of bit.ly links.  I find the most interesting content on blogs and reddit; in other words, by following people I find interesting and by engaging other people with a similar interest.  Sound familiar?  The page just launched today but they did something interesting: they held various [hangout discussions](https://plus.google.com/114401727024677849167/posts/LAPd9So1Qh3) with media figures discussing various political issues.  Maybe the average person will have the chance to one day partake - how cool would that be?  

What keeps me going to Google+ is that I can follow my interests and I love what they did with their election coverage launch.  I find it to be a better evolution of what Facebook and Twitter collectively are trying to do.  The foundation is set, now they’re going to war.

* I ate lunch once at BigTable. All food have their ingredients listed and color coded (eg potatos and sugar are red, veggies are green). There's **tons** of writing on the wall about eating healthy, and posters on the wall with ""Google Foodback"" (that's actually an intranet site), Google comics, lolcats on the wall.

* Google bikes everywhere on campus. Apparently somehow those bikes (which are supposed to be for the Mountain View campus only) ended up all the way across the word like in Australia.

* Weekly entire company wide TGIF meetings are actually on Thursday.

* Totally didn't get a demo for Google Glass from a dogfooder. It's a bit less impressive than what you think. But still cool.

* There are infinite pools, gyms, massages, beach volleyball courts, etc, wide open spaces with seats where you see some googlers with their laptop, but most Googlers do work in square and wide glass cubicles with glass walls and a bunch of desktop toys. Don't get the impression that most googlers lay on the couch or on the grass.

* Teleconferencing is used a lot. The intranet has a lot of stuff, from Omegle for googlers for lunch to quit smoking, I don't have access to it of course :( but did you know Google's Google Apps (/a/google.com)'s logo is a zoomed out pixel google logo? (Think Minecraft text, but 3x2 for a character)

* A lot of Googlers have a macbook company laptop. Mac minis power quite a few displays. You rarely spot an iPhone through, easy to find some dogfooder using Glass. If you want to access the codebase and version control, you'll need to use linux with software approved by the security team.

* Core languages: Java, Python, C++ and now Go.

* Google's SF office is quite cool too with a cafeteria and a bar. 

* Google has a diverse group of people (gender &amp; nationality) - not what you expect in a mostly software company!

* Kinda bragging now but the googler talks were fun, design a scalable fileserver from Jeremy Allison (cocreator of samba), android app dev tips from a Android dev guy, awesome driverless car footage with the laser sensor outputs, talks from a chromebook linux kernel developer..

* Their data / computational centers were hinted as more powerful than anything on the top500, and googlers can use the idle time for free.

* Yes, google hosts fun all expenses paid trips where you even tour San Francisco on segways and cruises. And in google tradition, you get shitloads of food, and a **lot** of swag - shirts, jackets, chromebook, beach towels, bags, water bottles, android mascots, gophers, and much more.",,False,,t5_2qh45,1367447079.0,,,True,t3_1dgrxv,http://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/1dgrxv/i_took_a_trip_to_the_googleplex_heres_some/,

Back up your data!",Cloud_Disconnected,111,25,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/fpvpt/google_reserves_the_right_to_terminate_your/,"Friday night I got home and tried to log in to my gmail account. It asked for my password, which it does occasionally. I typed it in, and was redirected to the help page for ""Google Accounts: I'm getting a message that says 'Sorry, your account has been disabled.'"" At the bottom of the page was a link to a form to fill out if you believe your account has been disabled in error. Of course, I filled it out immediately, giving all the relevant information. I thought it was weird and inconvenient, but I was sure my account would be re-enabled in 24 hours or less. Now it's Monday, and I've heard nothing back. Google Voice, Google Checkout, Blogger, Calendar, and worst of all, Google Docs, I'm locked out of all of it, probably forever. I can't even get in to the Android Market on my phone. I was at least able to get my contacts from my phone downloaded in to a file I uploaded in to my mail client. Once I change the account my phone is attached to I'll lose all my data on that too. And with Docs, I've lost about two years worth of work that wasn't backed up anywhere else. My CR-48 still works, but it obviously won't sync with Google's servers, so I created a new account to sign in with. So much for ""living in the cloud.""



I knew this could happen. I've heard other people tell the exact same story I'm telling now. Why I didn't back up my files and other stuff, I don't know...I suppose it's because I was lazy and I got complacent. I trusted Google. 



The help page says the most common reason for an account being disabled is a ""perceived violation of the Google TOS."" If I violated the TOS, I have no idea how. 



TL;DR: My google account was disabled and I lost a lot of valuable data. Back up your online data offline!

**Update:** Just got a message from a friend via google talk on my phone, my account is re-enabled! Needless to say, I just finished downloading all my documents and backing up all my emails. No word from Google on why my account was disabled in the first place, but I'll update if they email me. Thanks to those who offered advice, I hope reading this saved a few people from having to go through this.

I can invite people to Google+. This is on a first come, first served basis. Please send me a message.

Conditions:

* You may add me if you want, I may add you in return
* I promise nothing, and am not held responsible for anything
* There is no guarantee that you will get invited or that your invite link will work

**EDIT**

So invitations are full right now. I have a backlog of people who wanted invites. In total, about 30 people got invites tonight, which is pretty good. I'll invite those people who sent me a message while I was gone for the night.

This is frustrating for me, because Google Wallet was the ultimate convenience that I feel is sorely ignored. Here's what I was hoping for and why it would change my world:

1) **Google Wallet could make my life more secure.** By allowing me to spend online and in the real world through Google's servers, another level of security is added to my bank accounts and credit cards. By allowing me to choose a default card on the fly through the Wallet App, Google *could* allow me to leave my wallet at home and lower my risk of getting pickpocketed or mugged. By allowing me to shut off Google Wallet from any location I can log into Google, I could even stop a thief in their tracks simply by finding the nearest phone, computer, or tablet, which is faster than having to do so then track down a help number for my CC. All of this, however, relies upon...

2) **Google could migrate to the physical world and brought all my purchases under one roof.** NFC has been a major restricting factor in Google Wallet. If they made physical cards, I would be set under one card for all purchase. Using my phone, I could choose my default CC or I could set the purchases aside so that I could choose which card to place them on that day (there could be a timeout where it goes to my default card and maybe a provision where you can't delete CCs without making all the payments.

3) **Google could make social events a heckuva a lot easier using Wallet. They could also make people more integrated into their products and guarantee nobody flees to new Contacts systems like LinkeIn.** Every person I interact with in some professional or personal level has my e-mail address. I feel safe because my Google account is safe. If my coworker wants to go out and get food for the rest of us, I will be left out if I don't have enough cash in my wallet. With Google Wallet, I could send him money just by having his e-mail address and charge it to myself via ""debit"" to my bank card.

4) **Wallet could seriously challenge PayPal for several uses.** With anonymity controls for sending money, Google Buyer Protection (which they are already doing for top retailers), Subscription-based payments through Wallet (which is already implemented), and more, using people's vast adoption of Gmail and Google Contacts could turn Wallet into the prime place to purchase (because it's faster and safer), subscribe (because it's easier to cancel), and trade petty cash (because it's convenient).
