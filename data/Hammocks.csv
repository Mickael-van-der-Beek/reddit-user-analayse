You could buy an all-in-one set up like a [Hennesy](http://hennessyhammock.com/catalog/#hammock), or a modular [ENO One-Link](http://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/product/ONLK-DH.html), but you may not want to commit to the full shebang just yet. Or you're like me, and want to make a lot of it yourself!



**The Hammock**

*Types of Hammocks*

There are three main types of hammocks:

* The gathered-end, which looks like the hammock you see on old pirate ships. It's the most common used in hammock camping, in parts due to simplicity, cost, and weight. It is possible to lie flat in these, but does take tweaking. For this, most users sleep on a diagonal. 
* The bridge hammock, which has two bars and a slung-out section beneath them. The most popular among these is the [Bear Mountain Bridge](http://www.jacksrbetter.com/shop/bear-mountain-bridge-hammock-deluxe/) from Jacks 'R' Better (JRB). This allows a truly flat lie from head to toe, without needing to sleep on the diagonal. 
* The spreader-bar hammock is what you typically find in folks' backyard. because this type of hammock attempts to allow you to lie-flat with a high center of gravity, you are very prone to flipping out of these. There are a few camping variants of these on the market, and the strategy to remain in them is to add guy-lines out from the bar, and stake them into the ground.
 
Other types of hammocks exist (like the [Bat Hammock](http://www.mosquitohammock.com/bathammock.html) used in mountain climbing) but are much less prevalent, so we'll not discuss them in this intro post. 

_

A lot of folks on here are partial to the [Eagle Nest Outfitters (ENO) Doublenest](http://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/product/DOUBLENEST.html), which is a gathered-end hammock. I have one, and I like it! I take it to the park on warm weekends, and have slept in it before, even with another person. Wasn't too bad. Woke up a little stiff, but it was ok. 

There are plenty of other brands out there, and some are pretty good, some are pretty bad. Feel free to ask here or on the [Hammock Forums.](http://hammockforums.net)

So maybe you've had a hammock for a year or two and want to make your own, or you just want to skip buying one. 

Here's a [great little DIY from Knotty](https://www.hammockforums.net/forum/showthread.php?t=15205) at HF. This is for a gathered-end hammock, and is super simple. You will need to sew it, but it's not so bad (no pun intended). There are no-sew methods out there, but after ripping a few bedsheets, I think I'll sew some nylon now. 

For this, you want some ripstop nylon, about 10'-12' of it. 70D is heavier than 30D, but will hold heavier loads. For the ends, you'll want some paracord. 

Then, if you want a nifty little mod to create a sort of catch pocket for your feet (and top quilt/ sleeping bag), check out Knotty's [Stretch-Side Hammock](https://www.hammockforums.net/forum/showthread.php?t=40959)!

For the more advanced, check out the [Headessy](https://www.hammockforums.net/forum/showthread.php?t=670). 

_

**Suspension**

Once you have your hammock, you need to figure out how you'll attach it to your trees. An easy solution is the [Slapstrap system from ENO](http://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/category/straps.html). These simply swing around the tree, thread through themselves, and attach to your hammock. Being that they're wider than rope, they will do less damage to the tree. *Note: Apparently Slapstraps have a reputation for stretching. I will say that this has not happened with my Slapstrap Pros, but know that the hazzard is there.*

Another option to to get tree straps and [Whoopieslings](http://whoopieslings.com/images/p1010492_dk13.jpg).^(image credit: Whoopieslings.com) This is a light-weight, possibly cheaper (and more DIY) method of doing things. You can either [make your own whoopieslings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dgCy2qyIGY), or [buy them easily enough](http://shop.whoopieslings.com/Whoopie-Slings-AWS.htm). If you go the DIY route, get yourself some Amsteel Blue. about 13' yields 6' slings. 

Whoopieslings can either attach to your tree straps by carabiner, S-clip, or marlinspike and toggle. Just make sure that these are rated to hold the weight. 

Are you in a rockier region? Do you want to set up over a creek or stream, but there are only boulders nearby?  Why not get some [climbing nuts] (http://www.rei.com/category/4500707)? These are great auxiliary anchor points in rocky terrain! (Just make sure you pick up a removal tool as well!)

_

**Bugnet**

You can have either a detatched bug net, or an attached one. A lot of folks seem to like the detatched version, because you can leave it at home in the spring and winter, and possibly fall. All preference. 

Again, you can buy these, or [make one](https://www.hammockforums.net/forum/showthread.php?t=36328). more designs can be found at the links below!  

_

**Tarp**

Tarps are good because, well, nature rains. 

These come in many, many shapes, sizes, and fabrics. This all leads to different weights and so forth. Shug does a great deal of explaining how to set these up in his videos, which I will link below. There's just too much variability to get in-depth here. 

Some Basics

* Asymmetrical tarps are like rectangles. These are hung over a line and the corners don't line up on opposite sides of your hammock. Light-weight, great for summer (if you're not in the storm-ridden state of Florida, where I grew up).
* Symmetrical tarps tend to be diamond-shaped and line up. A little more protection, and a little heavier.
*Rectangular  tarps tent to be draped over a line “hotdog” style, and offer the most protection of these three. These have the option of added doors for winter camping protection and heat retention.

If you're car-camping, or just don't care about weight, and if you're just trying to make a quick, cheap fly for your first outing, you can easily modify a roofing tarp for this purpose. Videos of this exist on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqaSYONkTFQ), but you might as well just make (or buy) a good tarp your first time through. 

_

**Ridgelines**

There are two times of ridgelines: structural and non-structural. 

* Structural ridgelines tent to be tied just inside the hammock suspension, and they run across the hammock. These tie the suspensions to each other, allowing your hammock to have sag. The greater sag allows you to stretch diagonally in your hammock, allowing you to lie flat. Often you can hang a mini-hammock or cargo pouch from this line for easy access. 
* Non-structural ridgelines tend to be tied to the tree lower than your suspension lines, and they are often for your tarp and/or bugnet. By being lower, they allow your tarp to sit closer to your hammock, since you must hang your hammock high for a good hang. (Picture below)

_

*Tarps: under or over the ridgeline?*

This now opens the debate of how you hang your tarp: under the ridgeline or over. Either way works. Some folks like over the line, because it helps to support your tarp in foul weather, and allows you to hang gear from it. Downside: I've heard you can get drips under your tarp this way. 

There is a third option, and that is to not have a ridgeline for your tarp, but simple tie your tarp's to sides to the support trees directly. This is said to be lighter weight, but gives you one more piece of rope to leave behind in camp when moving on. 

_

To avoid rain, there are two things to do:
 	
Set your tarp out past your hammock's ends by about a foot (see photos and Shug). 
Add drip lines. These are simple pieces of cord that hang down off of your suspension and tarp ridgeline. As water falls down the line, gravity takes it to the lowest point, and down the line. I've heard of people leading these lines into their water bottles for collection during storms in a pinch. 

_

**Bedding**

Keeping warm in a hammock below 60 degrees F is a bit tough. Since your but hangs out, with air circulating around it, you tend to cool off considerably. Sleeping bags don't help below you, since by sleeping in the bag, you compress the fill, losing a lot of the heat retention properties. 

One solution is a foam or inflatable sleeping pad. You've probably used these while ground camping. Slip one of these (no too inflated, if the latter) under you in moderate temperatures, and you'll be alright. 

Some folks add a sleeve to the underside of their hammock for their pad. I think that gives you less control over your pad, but allows a breathable-ish layer between you and your pad. 

In colder weather, you can add an underquilt. As it sounds, this is a quilt designed to hang under (/around) your hammock, letting your hammock keep the pressure off the insulation, while keeping you snug and warm. You can get these in full length, ¾, or ½ length. This is a personal preference issue, with weight and cost being factors. I've honestly, in a pinch, taken a child's twin-sized quilt and tied it around my hammock on a high fifties night, so that it reached from neck to thighs, and been great. 

Another method is to modify their sleeping bags to fit around their hammocks. This is great, but you need a long bag! 

For the top half of your body, anything from a sheet to a topquilt can be used, depending on the weather. In warmer months, just use a sheet and skip the bottom layers (though a pad can help you to lie flat). In colder months, a sleeping bag works, but the weight-conscious tend to prefer a topquilt. This is a one-sided sleeping bag that may or may not have a foot box, and is used to keep your heat in. It can be filled with down or synthetic materials, and designs on this vary about as much as anything else in the hammocking world. 

_

**Your Gear**

You've got your hammock set up, but now what do you do with your gear? If you came with your car, you can easily leave excess gear there, but you may want some stuff a little more accessible. If you're backpacking, you are going to need to do something with your pack. 

For small items, you can easily use a gear organizer strung on your ridgeline, or clip items to your line with a mini carabiner. Another option is a peak bag. This is a long, sometimes tapered stuff-sack that hangs in the top of your hammock, by the gathered end, and allows you easy access to clothes, light, book, water bottle, etc. Some brands of hammocks (like ENO) come with an attached stuff sack for storing the hammock, and this sack, when the hammock is deployed, doubles as a gear pouch. IMHO, it's a great beer-holder when lounging by the pool X-D. Another option is to add endcaps that alow you to fit stuff at the end of your hammock. 

As for your pack, you have three real options. The first is to get a gear hammock. This is simply a mini-hammock that you string under (or over) your main hammock (often off of the hammock itself) to store your gear in. This keeps it off the ground, under your shelter, and in easy reach. [Just Jeff](http://www.tothewoods.net/HomemadeGearPackCoverGearHammock.html) has a DIY on how to make a pack cover that doubles as a gear hammock! 

If you don't want to add weight to your rig and more chord to the mix, you can also strap your bag to one of your support trees. This is lighter, but leaves your bag a few steps away. Be sure to add a pack cover to keep it dry! 

The third possibility (and least preferable to most) is to string your gear up with your bear bag. Just hope you don't forget anything! 


_

**Storage**

How do you store your gear, you ask? 

Well, as mentioned above, some brands come with an attached stuff-sack. This usually only fits your hammock. Other brands, especially the all-in-one kits come with larger sacks for everything. A design marketed by Hennesy is the [Snake Skin](http://hennessyhammock.com/catalog/products/snakeskins-xl/). These are a pair of nylon tubes that encompass your hammock and allow you to tie it to your supports without letting it touch the ground. Once you tie the hammock up, you pull back the skins, and out drops your hammock! There are plans out there for wider skins to hold your hammock, tarp, bugnet, and quilts, plus any other gear. 

A similar concept, though one that's easier to make at home, is the Black Bishop Bag, or simply the Bishop Bag. This is a stuff sack with a hole burned, cut, stitched, grommeted, or created in some other way in the bottom of the sack. This allows your cord(s) to stick out of the bottom of the bag to allow you to tie up your first end, and then simply open the sack, pull out your cord (and gear) and tie up the second end. You can make these big enough to hold your entire set up. While not as ""sleek"" as the snake skins, this is arguably easier to make, and can be less fussy to pack away when you're finishing up. 

These two options allow you to set your sleep site up in under three minutes, if prepared right! 

_

**Misc**

Here are some final thoughts on hammock set-ups. Some of these may seems like no-brainers, but they bear repeating. 

* In campsites that say nothing can be hung from trees, they don't just mean clotheslines. Sadly, this also means hammocks. Be sure to check with your campsite before heading out there to make sure you can bring your set-up with you. 
* Follow-up, some places do not allow you to leave your hammock up during the day. If that's the case, please observe the rules and take them down. Ask the rangers about their preference. You may be able to leave your straps on the trees, and just take down you actual hammock and tarp, etc. 
* Look out for widow-makers! When setting up your camp, make sure that you are not tying to a dead tree, or that you're not under a dead branch. These can fall without warning, and will lead to a less-than-fun camping experience. 
* Don't set up near the fire. Nylon is flammable. 
* There are some people who like to carry a small floor mat to place next to their hammock. This allows them to stand on something other than dirt/ grass when their shoes are off so that they don't track anything into the hammock. 
* If using 'biners in your rig, make sure that they are climbing-rated if they are being used to support your weight! Your mid-2000's hipster keychain will put you on your ass, which is no place to be.
* Like tent camping, don't be opposed to bringing light-weight, open-aired camp shoes. That way, when you get out of bed, you don't need to put your boots on right away. This also allows your feet to air out, warding off potential foot funk. The bonus with hammock camping is that you can clip your shoes off the ground, so if it rains, they're not getting wet. 
* Try to observe Leave No Trace principles when backpacking. That's just a given. ",,False,self,t5_2s7lm,1363367234.0,,,True,t3_1a7zz8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hammocks/comments/1a7zz8/onestop_intro_to_hammocks_post/,

When I was young, I was never able to sleep more than an hour or two each night. My doctor called it insomnia and said that I should take sleeping pills. This however is a major problem for me. Because I'm a wrestler, I try to maintain the quality of everything I consume which has boosted my immune system and makes me able to ""outgrow"" doses of medicine. 

Which is a problem. 

When I was 15, I went on a trip to lake Shasta and lived on a houseboat for a week, I noticed that I was able to sleep like a baby. Which got me thinking-maybe swaying would help me get to sleep, and maybe hammocks could simulate the same sway as waves!

On the Christmas of my 16th birthday, I asked for a hammock and was quite relieved when my parents were generous enough to get one for me. 
On Christmas Day, I set it up as quick as possible and couldn't wait for it to be night time so I could see if it worked. And it did. I slept for 18 hours. Hammocks cured me of my insomnia (of 15 years) and I am forever greatfull!

the 6 mods all quit because the owner stopped sharing what he did with all of the ""donations"".  a few hours later and all that's left is a 404.  
Here is the original message from moderator JustJeff:


Dear HammockForums.net members,

In October 2006, we started Hammock Forums to create the internet's most useful repository of hammock information on the internet, and to provide a peaceful sanctuary for hammock enthusiasts to discuss our shared interest. Through careful selection of moderators and by paying special attention to creativity, originality and respectful discourse, Hammock Forums grew into a unique community that many members proudly say is the best forum on the internet.

Integrity has always been the foundation of our operations here, and has undergirded that creativity and respectful discourse. This applies to members ensuring they give credit when using others' ideas, vendors (until recently) carefully ensuring they don't steal other vendors' ideas or profit directly from members' ideas without giving credit, and the moderator staff being as transparent as possible in the site's operations.

One key aspect of the site's operations that deserves special scrutiny is the donation procedures. The mod staff historically has proudly proclaimed that we moderate Hammock Forums on a strictly volunteer basis, and that all donations go solely towards site operations or improvement. We do not personally profit from your donations. However, you may notice that we have not been saying this recently.

This is because several months ago, the site's owner withdrew access to HF's financial accounts from all six moderators. Frankly, we have no idea what is happening to thousands of dollars of your donation monies. We have directly asked why the access was removed, and given an ultimatum that without access - not even spending authority, but only access to view - we can no longer moderate this website with the integrity we require. We offered several opportunities to remedy this situation but were rebuffed each time.

Therefore, it is with heavy hearts that all six of HF's moderators - Just Jeff, angrysparrow, NCPatrick, Cannibal, headchange4u, and John Sawyer - are resigning as Hammock Forums' moderators. We stand in agreement that if we cannot keep our word to the members, we will no longer represent their website. Furthermore, if the owner will not keep his word to us, we will not continue enabling him to profit from our efforts and from your donations. For us, integrity is more important than participation in any website.

We're sure Hammock Forums will continue without us and we wish you all the best in the future.

for new years i went up to kentucky to help my friend's family move and planned to camp out for a few nights on their land. things got busy in the move and we only had 1 night to camp but we made the most of it. it was the first time i had even unpacked the tarp, but that thing is well made and easy to set up.

you can see my friend's setup in the background. he was using my extra hammock gear and the tarp from his tent. no rain in the forecast, but gotta block the wind. for warmth he used his sleeping bag and thermarest pad, he is mainly a tent camper but is coming to the hanging side too.

i was using the yukon hammock from the woot deal with the new river under quilt. its a bit longer than the eno double nest so it fits me a bit better at 6'4"".

we both had a good night sleep and stayed warm throughout the night. i'm so happy that i came across the ama of the guy who slept in a hammock, which lead me to this forum and further down the hanging rabbit hole. it has changed the way i camp for the better, i look forward to going to sleep while camping now.

But occasionally I'll find posts asking something along the lines of, ""I'm new to hammocks and want to how to set up a hammock inside.""

I think the first time I heard about hammocks as an alternative to beds was here. So I looked to you guys as my hammock experts, and everyone was basically advertising ENO, Hennessy, and travel hammocks in general. I figured that they were the only hammocks out there worth using. Very rarely was there a mention of anything but travel hammocks.

However, there's a time and a place to use travel hammocks: outside. Of course, to each his own. If you love your ENO DoubleNest, use it as you please. But really, if you're trying to set up inside to replace your bed, go get a Mayan hammock, or a Brazilian, one made of cotton.

When you're outside facing the elements, a hammock made of parachute material would be very practical. It can be rained on and dried out good as new. It's great for backpacking/camping since it is so lightweight. It's really the best choice in that scenario.

But when you're inside, go the traditional route. Hammocks have been used for thousands of years in Central/South America as beds. However, they've been using *cotton* hammocks all this time and still do to this day. They're the most comfortable and still last many years if properly taken care of. Something similar to a Mayan hammock would be the proper recommendation for sleeping day in and day out.

So what I'm trying to get here is that as an /r/hammocks subreddit, we should distribute the attention more to include cotton/fabric/etc hammocks into the discussion.",,False,self,t5_2s7lm,False,,,True,t3_1j9zrm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hammocks/comments/1j9zrm/concerning_the_use_of_travel_hammocks/,
