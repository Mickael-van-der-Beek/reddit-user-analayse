There are a million reasons to quit, and a million reasons that you could potentially tell yourself that you should have one more.  The reality is that life is just plain easier without ""needing"" to do something when you wake up, or after you eat, or on your breaks at work, or whenever it is that you used to smoke.  Sure, it feels harder for a few days, maybe a few weeks, but you'll soon realize that you're not missing out on anything.  You can still hang out with the smokers, you can stand outside and breathe fresh air, you can do whatever it is that you used to do.  The difference is that you can now do it for free, and on your terms.  

You can allow yourself angry or nervous or stressed, without it being because you ""need"" a smoke.  You can stop what you're doing and take a break, because you deserve a break, not because you ""need"" a smoke.  Stop using cigarettes as an excuse to acknowledge that you have feelings, or as a tool to do normal, healthy things like being able to step away from a stressful situation for a moment.  Smoking doesn't actually help you deal with anything.  Taking time for yourself does.

It might help.",swervelift,210,39,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/16gitl/i_quit_smoking_3_years_ago_if_youre_trying_to/,"I used to smoke a lot of cigarettes.


For about 5 years (from 17 - 22 years old) I smoked heavily, often a pack a day or more.

I really enjoyed it too. I've never been the most balanced person, and smoking gave me a way to sort of manage my emotions. It was a crutch, and the longer I smoked the more it became an integral part of my being and the way I dealt with things in life. 


On top of that, I've never been the most socially adapted person, and smoking gave me a way to meet, talk, and share something with other people. I met some of my best friends through smoking.

I tried quitting many times. I knew smoking was terrible for me, and it was costing me a fortune (I lived in the northeast, where it was easily $12+ per pack - at a pack per day you do the math). But I also had a death wish. At some level, I was more concerned with the temporal state of myself, the one that just needed to smoke another cigarette to feel OK - I wasn't worried about future me. I knew that I should quit smoking, but deep down I was selfish and short-minded.

I tried a lot of things to help me quit - cold turkey, gradually, nicorette, hypnosis, Allen Carr's book. I tried and failed many times before I finally got it.

This is the advice I have for smokers who actually want to quit: 

**1. Understand why you want to quit.** You already need to quit, that's just a fact. But unless you truly want it, for yourself, it won't happen. ""We're all going to die someday, why not enjoy smoking, am I right?"" It's very hard to argue with that logic, especially during withdrawal. I learned that instead I had to say ""We're all going to die someday, why not take care of myself and do what I know is right, even if it's not easy?""

Unless you truly accept that quitting smoking will be a painful period of readjustment, you won't be able to succeed. It's not easy. When you learn to value your health, and respect yourself enough to see the damage you're doing, then you can start to quit. If you don't want to, you won't. That's just human nature.

**2. Learn to be self-aware.** Cigarette smokers are typically ultra-senstive to their emotional states. That's why it's so hard to quit. You can physically feel when your body is craving a cigarette, and you know exactly what will trigger it. My favorite time to smoke was right after a good meal, with coffee. The more aware you become though, the easier it is to pinpoint when you want to smoke and how to avoid those situations or at least endure them.

**3. Don't pretend it's ""just a bad habit"".** Your mind has become dependent on nicotine to survive. Let that sink in for a second. Your mind depends on nicotine to survive. The same way you need food, water, or rest. The longer you've been smoking, the more you've conditioned your mind and body to expect nicotine at certain intervals, and your emotional survival is largely dependent on it. You're like Pavlov's dog, conditioned to expect a cigarette every time a number of different things occur.

This is a perfect metaphor for what smoking does to your mind: http://static.themetapicture.com/media/elephant-tied-post-mindset-mind.jpg

So when you quit smoking, you're actually disrupting the way your body copes with reality. This will have a MAJOR effect on the way you deal with everyday life, especially during moments of stress.

It takes years to adjust to being a non-smoker. It's a matter of **re-educating** your body, and **re-routing** the way you cope with stress. When I would normally pick up a cigarette to deal with anxiety, I learned to instead go for a run, take a hit of weed, or do one of many other new habits that formed after I quit. These aren't perfect replacements, but over time you will adjust and your body will find a natural balance again.

Your actual psyche and personality depend on smoking to exist in their current state. When you quit smoking, it will change who you are as a person. In most cases, given a year or two to adjust, these changes will be for the better.

**4. Stop thinking of your mind and body as different things.** You aren't your mind, and you don't have a body. You are your body, and your mind is an extension of it. Therefore, the chemicals you put into your body will augment your mind and your view of reality. You can't hurt one at the benefit of the other. Take care of your body, and your mind will improve as a result from it. It just might have some growing pains.

**5. Make it easy for yourself.** Don't go from a pack a day to nothing cold turkey. I started by switching to American Spirit, a brand that doesn't treat their tobacco with as many chemicals as other brands like Camel or Marlboro. The chemicals in those cigarettes are probably harder to quit than nicotine itself - so by switching first it made it that much easier. From there, I cut down to 2-3 per day instead of 20, and eventually just stopped.
Be realistic about it. Try not to take an 'all or nothing' approach to quitting - it's dramatic and shortsighted.

**6. Be prepared to make sacrifices.** Your grades, your productivity, your level of fun. Your weight. That perfect cigarette after a big meal. The one you have after sex. Your excuse to talk to the cute girl ""hey, you gotta light?"" Those times when you're on the balcony, looking out at the city with a glass of whiskey in one hand and a cigarette in the other. You might even have to sacrifice a few friends. Over time you will make up for the temporary sacrifices - think of it like an investment you're making that will pay off in the long term.

**7. Exercise.** I don't need to elaborate here - but it is the best way I've dealt with stress after I quit smoking, and it reinforced that I was finally taking care of myself.

I changed a lot when I quit smoking. I had to. Otherwise there was no way for this new amount of nervous energy to go anywhere. I work out almost daily now, I eat healthy, I drink more alcohol (not saying that's good, but it's what happened). Instead of smoking a cigarette, I also learned to simply face my problems. I didn't hide from them or ignore them. I'm a better person now. I'm honest with myself. I'm mature and I'm stronger. 

The other day, I was with an old friend who still smokes after all these years. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes and I thought to myself ""I'm glad I was never a smoker."" It took a few minutes before I remembered that at one point I was.

So yes, the cravings will go away. 

I hope this is helpful, and if you have any questions I'm happy to give my thoughts. My life has improved vastly since I quit smoking, and I'd love to help another person do the same.

TL;DR: The key to quitting smoking is finding ways to redirect your stress and anxiety into new, healthier habits. It takes time, and it will undoubtedly change who you are as a person – but it will more than likely be for the better.

1355378779.0,168,self.stopsmoking,14rtod,Today marks Year One as a nonsmoker.  Here is the advice I wish I'd been given years ago.,lpjaok,188,20,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/14rtod/today_marks_year_one_as_a_nonsmoker_here_is_the/,"I started smoking at 19, averaged just about a pack a day, and quit cold turkey on my 39th birthday.  Haven't touched a cigarette for one year now.  Still go out drinking (usually too much), spend time outside next to friends who smoke, and have managed to pull it off, something I never believed I could do.  Here are some observations:

Alan Carr's ""Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" lives up to the hype.  It's as good as anything you'll ever read on the subject, but it won't work until you have decided to quit.  No book will work if you haven't done that.

If you do decide to quit, you absolutely need to refer to yourself as a non-smoker.  It sounds like a very slight distinction, but someone who self-identifies as a ""recovering smoker"" or a ""smoker who quit"" essentially lives with the baggage of the past, they think that they have a powerful habit they're trying to resist.  Completely reject this thinking and live in the NOW.  When you stop smoking, you become a non-smoker.  That self-identification is really helpful.

Everyone's experience varies, but I went through 72 hours of complete misery, then about four weeks of behavioral distress.  Hard to explain this, but it isn't simply what I pictured when I thought of ""nicotine withdrawal.""  For example, smoking at night conditioned my brain to anticipate certain chemicals before sleeping, and when I quit, it took my body a while to adjust to sleeping without those chemicals.  I had a couple of weeks of restless sleep, and woke up, WIDE AWAKE, much earlier than usual.  Bowel movements were no longer the result of nicotine-stimulated peristalsis, so that took readjustment.  Long after my initial nicotine withdrawal ended, I still felt fidgety and uncomfortable for a few weeks.

The second month was a MASSIVE improvement over the first month.  My body rediscovered old routines, sleep became sound again, and I felt like a million bucks.  But here's the real sign of success:  During the first month, I watched wistfully when my friends at the pub headed out to smoke on the patio together, telling myself I was strong enough to resist the urge.  By month two, I often didn't notice they'd even left, and couldn't care less.  I did, however, notice how much their jackets and hair smelled like a wet ash tray.  

When I tried to quit in the past (have done this three or four times), I used cessation aids, usually patches or gum.  I think they might work for some people, but honestly, I was better off without them.  I had previously used them to conceal my nicotine addiction from relatives, so when I tried to use them to totally quit smoking, I think I subconsciously treated them as temporary fixes until I could get back to the real thing.  I had to reject the smoking cessation aids, all of them, and just quit cold turkey.  This has one other great upside:  When you quit this way, you make progress much faster.  I have heard some people get excited about electronic cigarettes, but I don't get those at all.  You're still addicted to nicotine, and that can't be a good thing.

I lost weight when I quit smoking.  Pretty simple, in my case.  I had a terrible diet as a smoker, and since I was already a little pudgier than I wanted to be, I realized that quitting smoking could result in a much fatter me.  So I combined my quitting effort with a full-on cooking campaign and an interesting new diet (paleo, which you can check out at /r/Paleo), and I actually lost almost 30 pounds, all while my tobacco addiction was vanishing.  This also motivated me in quitting smoking!

I realize this has been a long post (sorry!), but these are all things I wish someone had told me years ago, when I first tried to stop smoking.  The most important realization anyone can have is that every day you continue to smoke, you are one step closer to being that pitiful person that sits in their car in a traffic jam, in the rain, with a window cracked and a desperate flaming butt protruding from the car, because you HAVE TO SMOKE.  You're one step closer to being the person who develops a hacking cough in their 40s that stays with them for the rest of their lives, one that will never go away.  The sad relative that shuffles outside periodically at every family function, slightly embarrassed in the knowledge that everyone else thinks they stink.  I didn't want to ever become that person, and I hope what I'm sharing might help some of you to avoid becoming that person.  

Congratulations to those of you who have quit, and for those who have very recently quit or are considering quitting, take courage in the knowledge that YOU CAN DO IT.  I have poor self-discipline and an addictive personality, and I'm done with tobacco forever.  Feel free to ask me any questions you'd like.

You have no idea right now just how beautiful your body is because right now, you're poisoning it and you don't know how sick you feel because you always feel that way. 

You don't know how good food tastes and maybe, you add tabasco to almost everything you eat because that's the only way you can taste anything at all. 

I do know that you hate it when you come home at night and clear your throat and it never feels like you can actually clear it completely. 

But no one deserves to be lectured to and that's not why I'm writing this. I'm writing this to tell you that you're doing the right thing. Keep reading this subreddit. Read other literature on quitting. The only person in charge of you and what you do, is you. And what you need to do right now, is start reversing some of the brainwashing you've been giving yourself for however long you've smoked for. 

You don't actually need cigarettes. 

They have absolutely no discernable value. You are paying a company to kill you, slowly. You can relax without one. You can finish a meal without one. You can do whatever you want and I promise you, a cigarette will add absolutely nothing to the experience, you and the chemicals in the tabacco have just convinced yourself otherwise. 

It may be one of the hardest things you ever do but you can do it and I promise, you will not spend the rest of your life depressed or yearning for a cigarette every day. And even if you get a craving every now and again, it's better than constantly having to think about the fact that ""I need to quit."" The amount of mental energy you pour into thinking about quitting is more valuable than you realise and you could use that some mental energy for so many other things, your family, your job, your art, whatever it is you want to do with your life. 

People quit every day and I promise you, you can too. 

Life is beautiful my friend and when you're ready, myself and everyone else on this subreddit will be waiting with open arms and we'll do our very best to keep you strong and support you the whole way through. 

See you soon.

After all, my grandmother/grandfather did it'' or ""I will only get sick if I continue to smoke for the next X amount of years, I'll be fine for now""

I have been smoking since I was about 14 years old, and now I have been diagnosed with a heart condition that will effect me for the rest of my life, and eventually lead to heart failure. 
..At the ripe old age of 20. All due to smoking.

I always thought that the health problems associated with smoking will open happen to me when I'm over 60, and thats if I still smoke then.

The surprising thing is that I don't even smoke that much, about a 1/3 of a pack a day, yet I have been given the misfortune of a pussy of a heart, thanks to smoking. Not genetics, not a bad diet, ALL because of smoking. But now alas it is time for me to stop before it quite literally kills me, and I really hope that you can do it too.

So next time you see ""smoking kills"" or a mangled set of tar ridden lungs on your packet don't shrug it off and say ''It won't be me"", I used to think the same, and now it is me. Instead realise that if you continue to be a slave to the master in your pocket, it will be your demise.

I'm not looking for gold, I'm not looking for karma, I just want to serve as a living, breathing reminder that if you want to see your kids graduate, and play with your grandchildren one day, you have to stop now. and I mean NOW.

Remember that growing old is a privilege denied to many of us, so grab smoking by the balls and say NO MORE.

Last Friday, I decided that I had just smoked my last cigarette. I was thinking of quitting for a long time, but sped it up: I've been feeling like an ashtray on legs for the past 13 years.

Here's the thing: apart from some mild side-effects (mine have been constipation &amp; insomnia), there's not much to it. All it takes is one, very simple realization: 

**Every conceivable situation in life is more enjoyable if you do not smoke - even the ones that we're conditioned to believe are ""made"" for lighting up** 

Example: On Sunday afternoon, i grabbed myself a cold beer, and stretched out on a sun bed. The view was amazing, pool + trees + low clouds. I had a favorite song on the iPod. Perfect time for a smoke right? 

Turns out these moments last longer, and are more vivid and relaxing at the same time, without cigarettes. You actually get to take in the scenery and enjoy the moment. When you're a smoker halfway through your cigarette, all you can think about is the next one^andthenextone^andthenextone. Where's the fun in that?

Thank you /r/stopsmoking for all the support so far, and the collective wisdom that led me to this breakthrough. i hope my 2 cents can ring a bell with some fellow non-smokers and potential non-smokers!",,False,,t5_2rbuf,False,,year1,True,t3_y7c90,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/y7c90/rstopsmoking_this_realization_may_have_changed_my/,

It sure as hell wasn’t easy for the first few weeks. And if im honest the next few months after that I still got sudden cravings. 

I gave up using the same technique my granddad used when he was told of he didn’t quit he would die. I picked a date, something relevant (in my case it was the last exam I had in Uni) a couple of months in advance and decided I would smoke as much as I wanted all the way up to the exam and have my last one before I went in to the exam. 

I didn’t tell anyone I was giving up until I was a week in. 
I kept a pack on me at all times for the first 6 months, I still have it.  I just told myself I could have one any time I wanted, but give it 5 minutes and see how I feel then.  I literally got through the first few weeks 5 minutes at a time. 

Now 3 years in I no longer get cravings at all.
Now for the bit you will be down voting me

After 3 years I am treating myself to a Cigar, it’s a Romeo Y Julieta a friend brought back from Cuba.  I know this won’t be popular on here but this is the point I always wanted to get to and feel I am at now.  I always thought of cigars as something different, not a habit but a treat.  Something I have maybe twice a year.  

It won’t be my first since I Quit and it won’t be my last, but finally I can indulge without worrying about a relapse. 

We all have our own goals, some want to be smoke free forever, I wanted to be at the point where on occasion I could indulge in something I enjoy, something I used to use to mark special occasions and something I can enjoy with friends. 

Feel free to down vote me in to oblivion, I wish you all the best with your struggles with various vices. Just remember the key isn’t patches, gum, preachy books (I hated Carrs book) or hypnosis. Its 3 simple things. 

1 Wanting to quit.
2 Picking a date and sticking to it!
3 Taking it one baby step at a time. 

TLDR: I quit 3 years ago but I still like to enjoy a cigar. 


UPDATE: incase anyones interested, the day after and no cravings whatsoever.

At week 1, a month seemed impossible. Now I'm at 3 months. You can check my history to see how the days went by. 

What I'm trying to say is that it gets easier. I know it may seem like as days go, you would crave more and more...but it's pretty much the opposite. 

All you have to do is physically not smoke. You have to just not go to the store, buy the pack, and light one. Cravings will be there, but they only do 1 of 2 things. Either they pass, or they make you smoke one. At the moment, you may think that the craving will never pass and that nothing will make you feel right except for a cigarette. Well, that's just a drug addiction doing what it's suppose to do. It WILL pass, I promise. If it didn't, just imagine how all us non-smokers would be feeling right now.

They give you cancer. 

Oh how fucking stupid I was.

I didn't know smoking made you so... tired.. 

I didn't know smoking robbed you of the ability to walk uphill and carry a conversation with someone at the same time. 

I didn't know smoking slowly, insidiously stole pieces of your life away.

I just thought one day you'd get sick. I didn't know you'd be sick ALL THE TIME.

I used to do things. I used to be able to go out on the weekends and go to the beach, to the movies, go for a run, hang out with friends at a BBQ, chase the kids around, have waterfights with them. I used to wonder what people meant when they said they were so tired. It was an alien concept to me.

You get tired from walking? HA! How could anybody just get tired from walking for christ's sake. I never thought twice about a long haul uphill. Now I carefully plan my route to make sure I take the flattest road, even though it will take so much longer. 

I'm early to work not because punctuality is important to me, but because I need time to smash out three cigarettes before I head in to start my day.

I turn down friends suggestions to go out and do shit. I say ""why can't we just go to the cafe/bar and chat?"" Because I'd rather smoke. Because all I think about is where I can sit to have a smoke. Before we go anywhere I need to know if I can smoke there, if I can't, I won't go.

If you break it down, I don't really want to spend my life in a bar or a cafe. I pretty much just want to sit down and smoke instead of actually doing something. 

I'm jealous of non smokers. I wish I never knew what this was like. Because as much as people like to think smoking doesn't affect your functioning, it does - in the worst way. Smoking does cause behavioural changes. It puts habits in place that only serve to make sure you get as much nicotine as possible. 

Wanna go for a walk through the park, have some ice cream, enjoy the great weather? Nah, let's just sit somewhere in the shade. So I can smoke.

I'm no longer a person. Just a conduit for nicotine. All I do is smoke. I was not made to smoke, but after doing so for so long, I feel I've been remade into this creature who only cares so long as they have a place to smoke. 


**-----------EDIT:--------------** 

For the past year I've been having dreams of when I was an early teen and a non smoker. In my dreams I am strong and capable and don't feel tired. Whenever I wake up its like holy fuck... this is what I've become. A skinny, grey, hollowed out wheeze machine. It's kind of like a quadriplegic dreaming about walking/running, then waking up just devastated. Difference is that this is something I can stop. I'm not trapped in my body. I make the choice to poison myself slowly. But then I feel... The damage is done. I can't undo it. The neural pathways in my drug addled brain are locked in tight and strong. I wish I could forget.

Sometimes I'm like, ""well what the fuck do non smokers *do*?"" The answer is life. I've just forgotten what that feels like. Smoking truly enslaves you. I'm a 24 year old woman, been smoking for 8 years. I feel like a 90 year old woman on her deathbed. All the fucking time. The body is willing but the lungs are like raisins.

One friend, who quit around the same time I did, was smoking an e-cigarette right in my face the whole night. Another friend, who still hasn't even thought about quitting, was really interested in the e-cig. I tried to ignore it completely because I know if I let even just a little bit of nicotine back in I'll be right back to two packs a day by the end of the week.

I got kind of hammered at the party, got a ride home from a smoker, and collapsed into bed. I dreamed that I was still at the party and I was smoking that e-cig, and from there just bumming smokes from people. It was really realistic dream. I got up and my clothes from the night before smelled like cigarettes. I was so disappointed and disgusted with myself I nearly puked.

I texted the friend who gave me a ride. ""I can't believe I was smoking last night!"" She wrote back, ""What?! When?"" From there we worked out that I never touched any of it and unless I was puffing away at home I was still a quitter. * whew * 

112 days. I can hardly believe it. A year ago I was hawking my TV so I could afford cigarettes (and choosing to just buy more cigarettes instead of buying food with that money). Now I'm sick to my stomach at the idea of lighting up. I never thought I'd see the day!

I've known since about day 100 that I was done with them, but always felt I would curse myself if I said this too often.  Not anymore though.  I'm a non smoker!

My biggest physical accomplishment since stopping?  I hiked 21 miles in a day back in September and still hike once per week at least 7 miles straight, usually 14.

I've also managed to avoid that 20 pounds of weight I always hear of people putting on by sticking to a keto diet most of the year and have, in fact, lost weight.

My advice on making it a year?  Take pride every day knowing that you are no longer a slave to the devil weed or, most importantly, no longer a slave to big tobacco who have spent years and millions making damn sure you never quit.

Holy shit that sounds awful when I write it down. No wonder I was burning away over 250$ a month on this dumb addiction.

I'm using Champix, by the way and they seem to be helping a lot. I don't generally like popping pills but fuck it! Whatever works!!

Then it was mentioned that they would be having a competition to see who could last the longest. I then very obnoxiously stated, ""I don't want to quit and I don't give a shit about being healthy. But I know for sure I'd last longer than you and I want to flaunt it. I'm winning this thing."" We decided to quit on October 1st.  
  
2 weeks later, I'm the only one left standing. I continued on because the lack of smoking has improved my karaoke skills.

My advice for everyone starting out:

1.  You have to honestly want to quit and to do it for yourself - be resolute
2.  If I can do it then anyone can - have faith
3.  Don't listen to your scumbag trollbrain - have vigilance
4.  Tell yourself daily how fucking awesome you are - have pride
5.  Read this subreddit daily and comment on posts - have support
6.  Incorporate non-smoking in an overall lifestyle change.  It doesn't have to be nuts but walk every second day and eating better  - have a healthy mindset
7.  Not one puff, not one smoke.  If you could handle the odd smoke you wouldn't be reading this post or hang out in this subreddit - have a reality check
8.  If you fail then start right back up again, don't use failure as an excuse to stop trying - have persistence 
9.  To not smoke you have to actually stop smoking.  Don't do it. - have strength

Here are the key milestones - focus on each one in turn and don't look beyond them:

1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year

By the time you hit two weeks the worst of it is over, hit 1 month and you should have relatively smooth sailing.  It becomes ""wants"" instead of ""needs"" - and fuck - you're not 6 fucking years old you know you can't have everything you want.

Hope this helps someone at the very least the actual writing of the post helps me (which is why I have posted so fucking much on this subreddit)  :)

Keep on keeping on.

Stumbled over this subreddit and thought I would share.  I quit smoking a few years ago after smoking a pack a day or more since age 15 (I'm 46).  

One thing I noticed over my several attempts was the extreme way nicotine withdrawal distorts reality, so much that I actually went ahead and listed the ways.  I call them the cigarette delusions:

1. Feeling:  You feel horrible right now.  In fact, you feel so bad, so down, that you will probably never feel happy again, but exist in a kind of half-alive state for the rest of eternity.  The only thing that can fix that is a cigarette.  Fact:  If you stay distracted for five minutes or so, you might forget that you ever felt that way.

2. Feeling:  You're craving... and right now a cigarette would be amazing, a sublime sensory experience beyond compare, almost spiritual.  Fact:  It's like having a baby dragon crap in your mouth.  The relief you feel is so intense it's nauseating, then sickening.  It's like psychic rape.

3.  That person over there is smoking... and he is the coolest person in the world.  How does he manage to look so cool?  *He* is successfully managing life, and smoking, too.  How come you're not cool like that?  Fact:  He is a fucking retard.

My hair still smells clean the day after I washed it. I can see clearly out of my car windows since I've washed all the tar off of them.  And my personal favorite was realized while I was on a date Friday night. I met a guy at a bar at 8:00pm and we stayed and talked until closing time at 2:00am.  During that time, I normally would have smoked about 3 cigarettes (or more, if I had been drinking a lot).  Instead, I got to stay at the table with him, continue the conversation, and not disrupt the flow of the evening.

In fact, this is the first time I've visited. But seeing as how 90% of my friends are still smokers, I wanted to share the news with some people who might understand how long a year really is.

**Do you miss smoking?**

No.

I don't miss scrounging for change in the couch or sacrificing my last few dollars to buy another pack.

I don't miss yellow stains on my fingernails and teeth that don't go away.

I don't miss that frantic shower and load of laundry before meeting people to make a good impression.

I don't miss having a smelly car/apartment/wardrobe/life in general.

I don't miss not being able to smell my smelly life, and also not being able to smell nice things.

I don't miss having a permanent cough, or being agitated all the time.

I don't miss suffering through a few hours of class, or a movie, waiting to go smoke another cigarette.

I don't miss going out in the coldest nights of winter or the hottest days of summer for no good reason other than ""burning one.""

etc. etc.

*Notice I didn't say a word about cancer or heart disease. Yeah, it's great that my risk for these problems has gone way down, but let's be honest. I never thought about those things while I smoked, and I don't really think about them now, either. Everything else on this list was a daily reality, and even back then I thought about how stupid it was.*

**But what about all the things you liked about smoking?**

Alcohol still gets you drunk, and meals still taste good, whether or not you smoke. Rides in the car are about the same too: nice sometimes, stressful sometimes, boring most of the time.

If I want an excuse to talk to a stranger, I just make one. It's called *confidence*, and you'll be amazed how much you gain once you actually quit.

I don't need cigarettes to pep me up; I eat well and get enough sleep. Occasionally I'll drink coffee. I don't need cigarettes to calm me down; as it turns out the cigarettes were generally making me more anxious and smoking relieved those withdrawal symptoms.

**Okay, okay, I cognitively understand all of that. But that irrational, emotional part of me still just *wants* to smoke. Help?**

Yes, that guy doesn't go away. He visits less and less frequently as time goes on, though.

But here's what saved me in those moments in the past year:

1. From day one, I stopped thinking of myself as someone who smokes. I considered myself a non-smoker, as in, my normal behavior is not smoking, ever. If I ever had doubts about what to do, I would simply decide to do what is normal behavior for me. Don't smoke.

2. I started exercising. I run ~15 miles spread over 6 days each week. You know it's what you need to do, but you don't do it because you smoke. Start today. Here's why it's important to your success: If I'm ever in a clouded state of mind (tipsy, depressed, tired) and the strategy in #1 isn't working, I remember that I have to run tomorrow, and smoking will ruin my progress.

3. Milestones work. I appreciate what you guys are doing, because clearly (just from a superficial glance) you're all about that. Repeatedly telling myself that I wouldn't even allow myself a puff until I reached one year kept me from doing it. You should do the same for 3 months, 6 months, 1 week if that's what you need. But once you reach it, you also have to tell yourself as I am today, ""PSYCH! You have to go at least two years.""

Been a smoker since I was 19. Which according to my arithmetic was about a million years ago. 

The urologist removed a cancerous tumor the size of a quarter from my bladder. Luckily before it attached to my other organs. (If that happens then medically speaking, you're screwed)


Men have two sets of plumbing. Located in the front yard (penis) and the back yard (anus). To remove a cancerous tumor from your bladder. The surgeon goes through the front yard.


The surgery pain is.... I'll put it this way. Remember what it felt like when you got kicked in the nuts? Well you'll wish it only felt that bad. And after your surgery. The urologist will be running a two foot long scope through your front yard every three months. ...yeah good times


My smoking was more than addiction. It was like a part of me. My twenty little friends named Camel, Tareyton, and Marlboro were always with me through thick and thin. Comforting me when the shit hit the fan. Or celebrating with me when everything was roses. 


But cancer is a great clarifier, convincing me to drop my twenty little friends. So I'm not taking their calls anymore. 

When that ugly hunger for a smoke starts screaming inside me. What's helped enormously these past few weeks. Is to use nicotine nasal spray. But I'd only recommend it to hardcore chain smokers trying to quit. You'll feel a chemical burning in your nose cavity, throat and then behind your eyes. It kills the craving in less than five seconds. But like I said. Only three pack-a-day smokers should consider it.


Good luck. And take a fool's advice. Don't wait until you're on an operating table trying to cut a deal with your maker for one more chance like I did. Now is the time to stop smoking. - Vic

One month after I quit, I now realize that my breathing, walking, running, exercising, climbing a staircase, bathroom singing has become much much easier! Over the years, I was conditioned into thinking that a certain amount of effort was required to do these tasks. Smoking had made me think that I was normal and this is how normal people feel after doing such stuff. 

I thought, its normal to abruptly stop deep breathing because it hurt my chest; its normal to pant after climbing 2 flights of stairs; its normal to clear your throat throughout the day; its normal to wake up and feel a little dizzy/disoriented. 

Just after a month, I now truthfully remember and feel how I was 7 years ago! Of course energy level has varied according to age but breathing, taste, smell has zero problems now!

1368452343.0,103,self.stopsmoking,1e8rmc,Thoughts on 200 days,ignoramus012,112,9,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1e8rmc/thoughts_on_200_days/,"I wrote this post 100 days ago, on my 100 day quitiversary. A few people asked that I re-post and update this list at 200 days, so here it is.

I don't pretend to be some sort of expert on quitting, and I'm not saying what worked for me will work for everyone, but I feel like 200 days is a significant milestone and that other quitters might be able to learn from my experiences.

* **You have to really want it.** If you're quitting for someone else or just because you think you should, you will fail. You are stronger than nicotine, but you have to believe it. Encouragement is helpful, but if it's not ultimately coming from yourself it won't help.

* **The moment you quit smoking, you are a non-smoker.** There's no such state as ""trying to quit."" Do or do not. There is no try. It doesn't matter if you've been a non-smoker for one year, one month, one week, one day, one hour, or one minute. We are all non-smokers.

* **Cold turkey is what worked for me.** I had tried e-cigs, but they just made me want the real thing more. Again, what worked for me might not work for you, so this isn't a hard and fast rule, but smokers are nicotine addicts, plain and simple. The quicker you get the nicotine out of your system the quicker withdrawal will subside. All that being said, don't judge other people's methods. I've seen a lot of people on this sub look down on others for using NRT's or e-cigs. The most important thing is to get off tobacco. That is what is most dangerous. Encourage people to give cold turkey a try, but if it doesn't work for them, encourage them to use *any means necessary.*

* **Read Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking.** Yes, he sounds like a shill. Yes, he's a horrible writer. Yes, he's annoyingly repetitive. BUT IT WORKS! I didn't even have to get through half the book before I no longer wanted to smoke. It's not about learning some magical method, it's about changing your attitude towards smoking. It's about confronting and breaking down all those excuses and justifications that smokers use to continue their habit. Every single one of them is bullshit. Deep down we all know it, but we allow ourselves to fool ourselves. In these moments, it may seem like our rational brain talking, but that nicotine imp is pulling the strings.

* **Judge smokers harshly.** Not out loud. Don't be a jerk to them or anything, just inwardly tell yourself how weak they are compared to you. Bask in your own awesomeness every time you see someone light up, or you catch a whiff of smoke. They can't do without cigarettes and you can! Last time I posted this, there was some trepidation over this part. Quitting is a mind game. The point is to convince yourself that quitting is the right thing to do and that you have power over the drug not the other way around. When I do this I'm not *actually* judging people, I'm playing a little mental game for myself to bolster my confidence.

* **Exercise whenever you get a craving.** It doesn't have to be super strenuous or anything, just do jumping jacks or jog in place or dance or whatever you want. I use a stationary bike. Just do something active for 5-10 minutes. It'll distract you from the craving, release some endorphins to combat the withdrawal symptoms, and help to offset the weight many former smokers gain when they quit.

* **Drink lots of water.** Most people are walking around slightly dehydrated anyway, so this is just good general advice, but I also found that a big glass of cold water lessened withdrawal symptoms. It'll also help flush out the nicotine.

* **Make new associations with things you did while smoking.** For example, lots of people say don't drink for the first couple weeks to a month. This may be the best course of action for you, but for me, I just needed to drink where there weren't smokers. Invite some nonsmoking friends over and have a few drinks and you'll begin to disassociate drinking with smoking. If it's not even an option to smoke, sometimes that keeps the cravings manageable. Did you have a cigarette every morning with a cup of coffee? Don't quit coffee, just do something else with it; read a book, or do a crossword or whatever... just make it something you enjoy doing that will occupy your mind while you're having coffee. Sooner or later you'll think about that thing rather than lighting up.

* **Know that you will most likely always have cravings.** Be prepared for that. My dad quit 10 years ago, and he still gets them sometimes. I get one every couple of days, but it's never an option to smoke, so I don't. With another 100 days under my belt, it's still true that the longer you go without smoking, the easier it gets in general, but there are going to be days and weeks that it gets hard again. When the weather started getting warmer, I had about a week where it was almost as difficult as those first few weeks. Occasionally I'd smell tobacco smoke and breathe in deeper. The smell didn't make me sick like it had been. Cravings were stronger and frequent. I thought about smoking and it didn't strike me as foreign and disgusting anymore. That passed, but it really surprised me. Know that this is always a possibility, and don't let it catch you off guard. Addicts are never truly ""out of the woods"" when it comes to their addiction. You're always at risk, in some way, of lighting up again.

* **There's no such thing as ""just one.""** We're addicts and we'll always be addicts. A little bit of nicotine will most likely pull you back into full on cravings and daily cigarettes. This goes for other forms of tobacco too. I'd love it if I could enjoy a pipe or cigar once in a while, but the risk of becoming a regular smoker is too great for me to allow myself to try. That being said:

* **Don't beat yourself up if you relapse.** One day not smoking is infinitely healthier for you than zero days not smoking. Congratulate yourself on making it as far as you have, forgive yourself, and get back on the horse. Nicotine is one of the most addictive drugs in the world and very few people earnestly try to quit let alone succeed on their first try. Just take it one craving at a time, and eventually those little bits of time will add up to a lot.

* **Set your badge on this subreddit.** Also get an app like QuitNow! or Cessation Nation. Watching that timer tick up is really satisfying and, the idea of having to reset it can be a powerful motivator not to give in to cravings.

* **Figure out how much money you spent per month on cigarettes and sock it away.** You were obviously able to live without that cash when you were smoking, so you won't miss it now. I'm putting mine into savings and just watching it pile up, but if it would be a better motivator, use it each month to buy yourself something fun or go out to eat or something.

* **Become an active poster on this subreddit.** At the very least, upvote everyone asking for help or giving good information. That's what makes it a valuable resource. New quitters get advice and encouragement and more experienced quitters get the confidence boost knowing they're helping others succeed, which keeps them quit.

* **You have done the impossible, and that makes you mighty.** Use your quit to help with other things in your life. Do you want to loose weight? Treat that cheeseburger like a nicotine craving. Are you trying to get the courage to talk to that person across the bar? Treat your desire to sit there and pine instead like a nicotine craving. Do you really need to get some work done, but it's boring as fuck? Treat your laziness like a nicotine craving. It does wonders.

I used to exercise all the time before I started smoking, going to the gym, hot yoga, weight machines, etc.  I have had breathing problems with exercise in the past, and when I started smoking they just got worse, so I stopped exercising pretty much all together.  Even when I finally worked down to 1-3 cigs a day, I still couldn't run even 1/4 mile without getting the most crippling side cramps.  Even walking up a flight of stairs in my school library winded me.  

I went for a run/walk (trying to ease back into it) around the lake this morning, and I seriously could not believe how easily I could run.  I can't believe how big of a difference just 11 days has made.  I forgot how good it used to feel.  I even shed a few tears and skipped for a bit because I felt so *joyous* to really feel my body getting back to good health.  I used to wonder how other people could run so fast and so long...turn out it's because they don't have tar in their lungs!  

I am so glad that I finally quit.  I'm so happy that I was finally ready.  It has been a little challenging quitting this time (I've tried several times before), but it was much easier than I thought it would be because I was just so ready to end that chapter of my life and begin anew.  It feels great to be living again rather than slowly killing myself.

No I didn't use allan carrs book or any other quitting aids. Cold turkey all the way.

I just wanted to post to say YAY. This is a real achievement for me right now. I even had a dream last night that I broke my streak and had a cigarette. I woke up feeling very very guilty and almost went to buy some. I resisted though.... go me!

To all those who are considering quitting, or who have begun the smoke free life. I just want to say... The power is entirely in your hands. Do not give the power to those little sticks of smelly dried leaves. You are a non smoker.. You were born that way.. Inhaling the nicotine brings absolutely nothing positive to your life. Every day you go without smoking you will realize this more and more. I honestly cant imagine myself giving in to this wretched habit again.

The cravings still come periodically but every time I feel it. I just quietly chant "" I am a non smoker "" and the monkey moves away for a while.

My resting heart rate is down to 60-65 on average. It was closer to 80 a week ago.

I can walk to work everyday now. Run up stairs (how ever dangerous). Lift/carry heavy objects with no shortness of breath. I get home in the evenings and don't feel the need to lay down for an hour anymore.

My mind is even a clearer now that I'm not thinking about that nicotine fix every 30minutes.

Nothing but positives to outweigh those irregular anxious cravings that come and go.

1) I still get pangs of cravings. But they aren't normal ""I-really-need-a-cigarette-right-now"" cravings, they're ""I *could* use a cigarette right now,"" and then I think, ""Why? You'll smell like smoke, you'll beat yourself up, it isn't worth it."" And it goes **away**. As soon as I preoccupy myself, they're gone. I'd rather deal with little tiny thoughts for the rest of my life than smelling like smoke and sacrificing my health.

2) I initially replaced cigarettes with food, but that's starting to level off now. Excess habits are starting to break left and right.

3) Things seriously *taste* and *smell* different. I didn't really expect it, but things I really enjoyed before I stopped smoking I actually don't now. I use less salt on food. I can instantly tell if there was a smoker in the restroom a few minutes before me. I can tell a smoker when they walk into a room. My perfume actually stays on all day.

4) I don't have to stand out in the increasingly-uncomfortable warm weather to suck down a cigarette. One of my biggest fears is wasps, and now I don't have to worry if I'm going to get stung by one just standing outside smoking.

5) The smell was a big deterrent for me. Health was less of a factor when I quit, but it's becoming increasingly a factor as I get used to not smelling like smoke.

6) My teeth have whitened! Incredible.

7) My dating prospects have opened up since I quit. Now I've got a few dates lined up with guys who aren't smokers, who consider smoking a dealbreaker.

8) I'm handling stress much easier now. I never thought I'd say that, after 9 years of using smoking as a stress reliever. I'm actually confronting issues and owning up to social mistakes rather than just going outside and smoking to ""get away from it.""

9) I don't have to accommodate my habit when I go out anymore. So instead of asking ""Does [the bar] allow smoking?"" now, I find myself saying, ""How's the cocktails?"" or ""How's the food?"" I've been able to open up a lot of options to me that I didn't even explore before because the establishment didn't allow smoking.

10) Just by me quitting, I've helped spark my friends to quit. One of my roommates is a month in, and two of my closest friends have set their quit date for a month from now. Just by being someone who has successfully turned away from cigarettes and has no desire to go back, I've become an inspiration for people who know me. That's a big motivator to help me stay smoke-free! :)

By the time I was in college I was smoking a pack a day. 

At 30 I was smoking close to 2 packs a day.

At that time, the thought of completely quitting was absolutely unfathomable. I thought to myself, there was no friggin way I could ever stop smoking. So I decided on the next best thing: I would cut down.

My first goal was to cut down to 1 pack a day. This I managed with some help from Nicorette gum.

**Side note: 
I read some of the Nicorette discussion on some other posts. Personally, I felt that it was helpful in controlling my craving although(or maybe because) it tasted NASTY. I did not experience any negative side-effects. However, I took it only for about a month and never took more than 2 or 3 pieces a day.

In the following weeks, I gradually reduced the number of cigarettes smoked. Every night before bed I would ""ration"" the number of sticks I would smoke the next day. I even had a schedule planned in my diary for the exact time I would smoke each cigarette. It sounds silly but my ""smoking schedule"" really helped me stay disciplined.   

After about a month, I was down to 10 sticks a day and I felt confident enough to stop taking the Nicorette chewing gum. But even at this point, I still had NO intention of quitting. My goal was still simply to cut down.

Well, nothing happened. That was the 8th of February, 2005.

So, why would I do this? Well, it's easy, I NEED to quit. I need the nearly 300 bucks a month, and I need to be able to walk up a set of stairs without feeling like I'm going to pass out.

Also, I really like to help people, and I like being accountable to people. I've seen this book mentioned all over this reddit, so if it works we all win. I'll give away ONE book every TWO weeks.

I was in such bad shape that my blood pressure shot up so high that I ended up in the emergency room being treated for what they thought was a stroke.   I have some answers now that may be pretty alarming.

Upon my fifth Dr. visit, we discovered that I have a chemical imbalance that causes clinical depression.  This was coupled with some ADHD.  I am now being treated for the depression and I feel a whole lot better.  

The nicotine I had been using for 25 years had been serving as a sort of treatment for the depression through its chemical release of endorphins.  By quitting smoking, I had basically ceased my self medication for depression that I did not know I had.  When I did that my blood pressure skyrocketed and I started feeling like shit constantly.

I am also not alone.  Studies suggest that up to 25% of smokers suffer from some sort of chemical imbalance that keeps them hooked much harder than other people.  So much so that it has been reported that people with Depression have a less that 6% chance to quit smoking for a year without alternative treatment. 

My message is a simple one.  If you are still feeling nasty pangs after 3 weeks or a month, you may be more than just addicted.  Get your ass to a Doctor post haste and get yourself checked out.  The treatments for depression are cheap and readily available. 

ALSO keep an eye on your blood pressure.  It should go down after you quit.  If it starts going up, this is a sure warning sign that you need to get to a professional.

Smoking is shitty. We all know that. It stains your teeth, lips, and fingers. It smells absolutely disgusting (I know disgusting is subjective, but I've never heard of someone saying that smoke smells good), and it leaves that smell on almost everything you come in contact with. It lowers your physical abilities, increases your chances of heart disease and cancers. But the worst part: it's fucking expensive. If you smoke one pack a day, you're going to be spending over $1500 a year on cigarettes. And for what? Those 5 minute breaks every hour? Not worth it.

You have to convince yourself that smoking is bad, wrong, etc and that you don't want to do it anymore. I mean, you obviously **don't** want to do it anymore or you wouldn't be here, right? So stop smoking. Seriously. Look at your pack of cigarettes right now. Open it up. Look at the cigarettes. Look at them. Seriously, stare them down. Those skinny little life-fuckers are going to kill you. And they aren't even going to be quick about it. They're going to make you smell like an ashtray, run up your heart rate, and make your skin pale. You don't want that. Fuck those things. Seriously. Well, not literally, but seriously - hate them. You *hate* cigarettes now. Slam the pack shut. Now! Throw the pack against the wall. Be pissed! Fuck cigarettes! Fuck that shit! You're better than that!


Feeling angry yet? If not, reread the last paragraph until you're pissed off at cigarettes. If so, good. You're almost there. Now you just need to make up a plan. It isn't a plan to quit smoking, it's a plan to keep doing all the things you did when you quit. Your 5 minute breaks are still possible. You can take a breather. Only now you'll *actually* be **breathing**. Go to a quiet place on your breaks. Go away from the smokers. You can meet up with them another time, but right now, on your break, it's **your** time. It isn't time for those nasty little cigarettes either. Take deep breaths. Focus on the trees. Focus on the sky. Listen to the birds. Hell, listen to the cars whizzing by on the road. Focus on something else and let your mind wander. Don't even think about those piece of shit cigarettes. Think about yourself just wandering around the forest, all by yourself, with no one else. Not even a squirrel. And sure as fuck no goddamn cigarettes. You're on your own now. And you can handle it. You're a redditor, for Christ's sake. We raised half a million dollars for underprivileged kids. We helped Egyptians take back their country. You're a part of something bigger. You're not the voluntary customer of a product that will physically and financially harm you, and probably kill you. You are fucking awesome. 

How do you feel now? Empowered? Can you take on the world? Can you kill a bear? Can you feed millions? I bet you fucking can. But guess what - you don't have to! You just have to quit smoking. And that shit is fucking easy. Millions of people have already done that shit. Smoking sucks. You know it too! Just think about how pissed off you were at those stinky little fucking pricks. You can do this. Carpe diem! Sieze the day! Then fuck it! Fuck smoking! You can do whatever the fuck you want!

How quitting smoking nearly killed me. ,3rdOctJaded,116,26,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/wla9h/what_they_dont_tell_you_how_quitting_smoking/,"As you guys can see, I have a few days under my belt. What I have re-learned in the last 8 or 9 months is that the drug nicotine is a stimulant.  Stimulants are used to treat several medical conditions and some people self medicate with stimulants.

In my case I have adult ADHD that has gone undiagnosed. I was using cigarettes to self medicate for it. When I quit smoking, I had the withdrawal symptoms for about 2 weeks.  Then all was right with the world. About a month later the withdrawal symptoms were back with a vengeance.  For 6 months I dealt with the DT's on a daily basis.  My blood pressure skyrocketed.  My drinking increased because I was trying to drown the symptoms. 

For 6 months I have lived in hell inside my own head knowing the treatment for my ailment was across the street at the gas station. I went to doctors who though I was just depressed and that my wallet was too heavy.  So they focused on those 2 conditions not really giving a damn about me.  Last week,  I finally found a therapist who diagnosed me correctly and a doctor to treat it. 

Yesterday was my first day on adderall and 30 minutes after I took it--it was like a light switch going on in my head.  I wept.  The reason I am posting all of this is that if you feel like you are having an abnormally hard time trying to quit, then your problem may lie deeper than just an addiction.   It won't hurt you to consult with a doctor when you are quitting and even consider seeing a therapist once or twice to make sure you don't have some deeper seated problem. 

If I can tackle this and stay clean after 8 months of withdrawal symptoms then you can too!

1369368557.0,89,self.stopsmoking,1eya85,So I work with some smoking cessation experts and they've helped me quit smoking. Just wanted to share some tips that I got from them.,mph1204,105,16,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1eya85/so_i_work_with_some_smoking_cessation_experts_and/,"So I work for a pharma consulting company and one of the things we work on is smoking cessation products (gums, patches, lozenges, etc).  Some of the people that I work for are top researchers in the field of smoking cessation.  I started working there about three years ago and kept smoking, which was awkward considering the working environment. I tried quitting a couple of times on my own, but I would just start up again a few days later. I was a little paranoid about stinking after my lunch break but the lure was too much.

One day, my VP came into my office and asked me if I'd like some help to quit smoking. I took him up on the offer and I am now three months without a cigarette! I thought I'd come on and share some of the things that I learned. A lot of it is just recap of stuff that's already on here, but it might be nice to have it all in one place.

Some fun facts about smoking and quitting:

1) Those who have quit by the age of 35 have about the same life expectancy as those who have never smoked before.

2) For every year after 35 that a smoker quits, s/he can expect to gain about 8 months of life expectancy.

3) It's much harder to quit if you started before the age of 15 since that's the time your brain is still developing and is more vulnerable to addictions.

4) Nicotine by itself has shown few harmful effects on the body aside from some cardiovascular effects. It might actually help in cognitive function if administered the correct way.

5) Gums and patches have a fairly low success rate on their own, but when you couple a good support system with multiple forms of nicotine replacement, the success rates rise substantially. Also, as FDA has recently announced, you CAN keep using it even if you continue to smoke. Prior to a few months ago, they were saying that if you relapse you have to stop using it. Well, that was crap, so...yea.

6) A lot of smokers say that they smoke out of stress. However, the nicotine withdrawals cause anxiety and may exacerbate any stress you might have. Ex-smokers say their stress levels decline dramatically after smoking.

7) You might gain weight when you quit smoking. Ex-smokers are on average heavier than those who have never smoked, even a long time after quitting. They don't really know why but I kinda suspect it's because you can finally taste things properly again! I just want to eat and taste everything again!

8) E-cigarettes are awesome. They're not FDA approved so you still run the risk of having crap in there that's not good for you (and my VP kinda gave me a disapproving look when I told him I was using one), but if you check out reputable sites or even our own /r/electronic_cigarette, you'll probably be fine. They fulfill the nicotine craving and that oral fixation (teehee). Plus, if you like smoking hookah, the smoke consistency is pretty similar if you use a good quality e-cig (thick enough is thick enough to blow awesome rings with). I love it.

9) There are more former smokers in the world than there are smokers. More than half of all smokers in the world have already quit. It can be done!

Tips on how to quit:

* Choose a quit day and stick to it.  Make it about a month ahead of time so you have some time to prepare yourself.
* Don't do it alone! Let someone know you're actively trying to quit smoking. Obviously, it would be great if this person was a family member or friend who is around a lot to help you through cravings.
* Understand that you're biologically dependent on a drug now. You've changed your body's baseline so that it only feels normal when you have nicotine in your system. If you try to quit without the aid of nicotine, you're going to have a much harder time since you're fighting your body's natural impulses.
* Start using NRT (nicotine replacement therapy) about two weeks prior to your quit date. Smoke as usual during this time. I found that during my two week pre-quit period, the gum and patches were keeping me feeling pretty good. I still had a cigarette at lunch, but I only smoked one versus the four that I usually smoked during my lunch break.
* On your quit day, get rid of everything associated with smoking in your house, car, etc. That means your lighters, matches, cartons, packs, ashtrays...whatever it is, it has to go. If you're like me and you have a really nice ashtray that is a nice collector's item that you'd like to hold onto, pack it away somewhere or give it to a friend to hold.
* Keep yourself out of situations where you'd have a cigarette. I used to smoke a lot when I was out at bars with friends. I haven't stopped going out to bars, but I will decline to join them outside even when I'm left alone inside. It keeps you away from the temptation and hey - you'll smell better when you hit on that cute chick/dude from across the bar while you're bored waiting.
* If you relapse and have a cigarette, IT'S OKAY. You haven't failed. Continue using the nicotine replacement therapies and get back on that saddle. Think about what prompted you to smoke. Were you in a specific situation? Were you bored? What can you do if you were put in that situation again? 

Anyhow, I hope this is useful! Let me know if there are any questions.  Thanks for reading!

I want to quit! It’s somewhat empowering to write it – even more to say it and tell people and mean it. I’ve only gone 1 day so far. I know it will be hard, but this time will be different. 
I’ve been so broke ever since getting out of college. I’ve been working cool, but underpaying seasonal jobs all over the country and have always been saving my last dollar for a pack of smokes. I could sit down and try to tabulate how much I’ve spent, but it would be really disheartening to know how much money I’ve wasted. 
I also have a girlfriend that I am head over heels in love with. She doesn’t like me smoking, but I’m not quitting for her – I’m quitting to be fair. We were drinking one night and I had gone outside to light up a smoke. She came out and asked if she could have one. She had never smoked and I flat out refused. I told her that it’s super addictive and you’ll be hooked before you know it. She looked at me, then asked “if it’s so bad for me, why are you still smoking?” I came up with a million excuses, but I’m tired of coming up with excuses.
I’ve always felt that I could have these little intimate moments with cigarettes, as if they were my friend that was always there. When I needed a minute to sketch out, I could pull out a smoke and do my thing. After a stress, tense situation, the cigarette would be there to calm me down. Drinking by the campfire, the cigarette would remind me what a great time I’m having. I’ve realized that I can have these little moments to myself without risking my body.
I really want to stop. I hate being outwitted by addiction. I want to exercise my willpower and beat this thing. I’ve been smoking for the past seven years and I’ve finished Day 1. I believe you should have the freedom to put whatever you want into your body, but today I’m done.

Didn't crave a cigarette. I'm still drunk, and I can't sleep because I'm so drunk and I'm afraid to puke in my bed,  so I figured I could contribute something to this awesome sub. You guys helped me a lot. 23/M/smoked for 8 years.


To all the recent quitters: 

You can do this. Seriously, I thought I couldn't do it when i quit on new year's eve, but it worked. You rock, be strong.

To everyone who wants to quit: 

I'm not going to lie, the first five days were hell for me. Didn't want to see anybody. Stomach aches.  I ate at least 10 whole toothpicks in the process. But keep on going, you'll feel amazing, trust me. You can finally breathe. 

* You know this feeling when you feel like suffocating and you can't breathe? Fucking gone. I hated that.

* Anxiety? Gone, you forget about cigarettes.

* Want to smoke after a meal? FUCKING GONE!

* Want to go up more than 15 stairs and not die? NO PROBLEM!

* Stomach shit problems fucking gone.

* All the fucking money, all of it. Take it. 


And contributing to this sub as a quitter feels so awesome. I'm almost crying right now, because this is the first time can tell other people how fucking awesome this is. Fuck these fucking cigarettes. Fucking fuckshit. You don't need this.

I know you think: ""Just another dude on this sub telling me it feels good to quit, I should just unsubscirbe and keep on smoking."" That's exactly what I thought, too.

But fuck it, just quit this shit already. It's time. You've smoked for too long. Think about your future children, your wife/husband. Your health. The'll need you. 

And if I just convinced one person to stop smoking, I'm the happiest human on earth. 

Goodbye and good night.

Because the truth is that, even if my habits still have yet to fully catch up, it's been nearly three weeks since I've started to believe that who I am - who I *really* am - isn't an addict. Nearly three weeks since, after a very long time, I've started to believe in myself again.

It has gone by rather quickly and I now really truly feel like a non smoker instead of an ex smoker. I still get the urge to smoke every now and then, like after a beer or when I'm feeling bored or stressed, but that passes very quickly, and happens rarely and it's more like a 'heh, I used to smoke one at this point' than an urge. I'm overall very happy with my success and very glad  I made that decision a year ago. The best decision of my life.

For all of you who are thinking of quitting go for it, drop that cigarette now and don't let your addiction stop you. You will not regret it. It will be hard, but it will be worth it. For those who have recently quit, keep at it and don't give up the fight. It will only get easier and one day you will look at a random smoker and think 'What? I used to do that?'.

I was tobacco-free for close to a year. I first quit by will power. Recently, I sampled an e-cigarette at a party, and found myself craving one a few days later. I figured it couldn't hurt. ""It's just nicotine vapor,"" I told myself, and ""I won't smoke it very often."" I didn't recognize the ""just one"" fallacy I was committing.

Fast forward a month and I was a frazzled, nicotine-dependent mess. See, you can smoke an e-cigarette in your car or bedroom without stinking it up. You can take a quick drag in the bathroom and no one has to know. In fact, I would hit it in all sorts of public indoor non-smoking places, like the grocery store. You don't have to wait for an entire cig to burn, you can take one drag and put it back away. They're cheaper than cigarettes. They taste better, they're not as harsh, and you can change the flavor at will. There's no butt to throw away. Where cigarettes were a hassle, e-cigarettes were perfectly convenient, in every conceivable way, except maybe charging.

Easily accessible, cheap, pure nicotine boosts? The end result is that I was ten times as nicotine-dependent as ever before in my life. I tried to wean myself off the e-cig, but it wasn't happening. Every day I had it, I increased usage by some tiny amount. It was getting ridiculous.

So one day, I threw away the infernal thing, and the flavored nicotine water gel shit I still had left. I waited until garbage day, so I couldn't dig through the trash later when I wanted to smoke. I watched the garbage truck take it away...and that's when I knew I had a problem. My nicotine cravings were insane. I wasn't ready for it. Panicked, I went for a run to calm my nerves. I didn't plan it, but I found myself purchasing cigarettes at the gas station. I rationalized and made promises to myself and fell right back into being a ""confirmed smoker,"" just like I was before. E-cigarettes brought me into the pattern stronger than ever before. I never used to smoke more than half a pack a day, but within a few days I was smoking more than one pack every day, trying to achieve the same crazy nicotine levels of the e-cigarette.

How did I quit again? I read Easy Way, and I quit my own way. So far, so good. This subreddit has been helpful. Thanks guys!

**TL;DR It is my personal opinion that e-cigarettes won't help you quit. They just re-enforce all aspects of the addiction, make it easier to smoke, and in my case made me revert back to cigarettes for a while.**

Edit: OK, if e-cigarettes help you, that's great! To me they were many times more addictive than cigarettes. Maybe it's weird to get off e-cigs by smoking normal cigs, but that's what I did, and quitting cigarettes was really easy by comparison. I don't mean to disparage. Go forth! Stop smoking! Do what you want! I do mean to warn that if you're like me, you'll get super hyper addicted to e-cigs.

&gt; Help me stop smoking. 

No. I won't help you. I can't help you, but if I could, I wouldn't (I'll get to that in a second).

Quitting smoking has to come from within. A few questions for you:

* You say you are a bit less than a pack a day smoker. How many days do you lie to yourself about smoking less than a pack? I seem to recall lying to myself about smoking less than a pack, only to realize that I was opening up that new pack a bit earlier each day. What about the other lies (relieves stress, something to do when you're bored, this is just a temporary cough/cold)?

* Why do you want to quit? I mean, if you want someone to help you, I need to turn that into you helping yourself. So, why do you want to quit? Bad day? The money? Lungs feel hot?

* What is your favorite thing about smoking? What about your favorite brand? Also, what state do you live in?

Answer those questions then read on. Answer them truthfully. **Write them down**; not typed, but hand-written. And, for fuck's sake, do it neatly. This is important, right?

---

Now that you've answered the questions, lets get started. You want to quit smoking, do ya? Well, let's go over those questions.

1.) If you say you haven't lied concerning your disgusting, stinky, and murderous ADDICTION to yourself you are currently lying to yourself. Figure out at least one smoking-induced lie *that you told yourself* and then continue....... Why are you lying to yourself? Is that normal? Is that a healthy habit? You do it because you're being a selfish asshole. Not because you want to, but you've fallen right into big tobacco's trap. It's time to break the trap, my friend.

2.) A temporary quit is **WORSE** than anything ever. The feeling you get when you relapse is equivalent to 10x the depression that every American feels when they hear about the cast of The Jersey Shore in the news. Plus, it just proves that you have a **WEAKER** will than the tobacco executive has cunning. Be strong and confident. You will **NOT** have a temporary quit (which will make you feel further back than where you started). You will quit this time and **BECOME A NON-SMOKER**. Take three cigarettes out of your pack and place them next to the pack.

3.) I personally liked the feeling of smoke going into my lungs. That was the greatest. Except for when I would wake up COUGHING AND WHEEZING AND **I WASN'T ABLE TO LAUGH WITHOUT COUGHING**! You may not be at that point, but if you keep smoking you will. You have to stop now, while [you're healthy enough](http://whyquit.com/whyquit/bryanandson.jpg). Don't wait, soon [it will be too late](http://whyquit.com/whyquit/bed.jpg). ~~Smoking does not relieve stress.~~ Smoking only relieves the stress that **NICOTINE CREATES**. It is a trap that you can break **EASILY** with a few days of **MILD ANXIETY**. That's it. No pain, just a few days of light insomnia and grouchiness.

Write down 10 people that you are closest to on a new sheet of paper. NOT THE BACK, a new sheet. Here are some suggestions:

Mom, Dad, Brother(s), Sister(s), Aunt(s), Uncle(s), **PEOPLE YOU SEE EVERY DAY ARE A PLUS**.

Take your pack and dump the cigarettes in a bowl - LEAVE THE THREE CIGARETTES OUT. Fill the bowl with water **JUST HIGH ENOUGH TO COVER THE CIGARETTES**.

You are about to become a non-smoker. You will have ups. You will have downs. You will enjoy every moment of it. **LAUGH** at the thought of those stupid, floating cigarettes having any control over you. They are garbage, and should be treated as such. Break open one of the three cigarettes and look at the tobacco inside. That's it. That's all you're afraid of - some dried up plant. Oh yea, that plant is **COVERED WITH STUFF DESIGNED TO BOTH KILL YOU AND KEEP YOU ADDICTED**!! What kind of sick bastard would design that? A greedy motherfucker, that's who. You're done giving them any of your money.

Smoke one cigarette. Ash into the bowl. Read this while smoking:

Why do you smoke? Do you honestly enjoy it? I thought I did, but I really didn't. It took quitting for me to figure that out, and honestly I'll never smoke again. I was trapped. One in the morning, one before bed - hell, one during bedtime sometimes! And if I went out? Add **AT LEAST** half a pack extra to my daily tally. Inhale deeply and meaningfully. If smoking were truly enjoyable, you would be doing it ALL THE TIME. Why take a break? When you are done with that cigarette put it out in the bowl.. **and light the next one, your FINAL cigarette** - but not with a lighter. Take the first sheet you wrote your answers to, and light it on fire. When it's almost completely burned out, light your last cigarette with it. You know the lies you told yourself, the reasons smoking is bad, and are realizing that the biggest lie was that you actually enjoyed the crap. You don't need the paper to **free yourself from the trap**.

Daunting, isn't it? It's not. It's a piece of garbage that doesn't even taste good. It makes you feel like shit and the only promise of feeling better while addicted is to feed the addiction. The funny thing is, **SMOKERS GET MORE CRAVINGS THAN EX-SMOKERS!!** They just feed them because they are weak. You are strong, you will kick the habit. Smoking is silly, you smell like shit and the opposite sex is repulsed by your stench. And you look stupid as hell, too. You don't look cool, dark, or brooding - you look like a crackhead who needs to get his fix, but his fix is never enough. Finish that cigarette and think about why you don't want to smoke ever **EVER** again. Put it out in the bowl as well. Notice how disgusting that water is getting. That disgusting, fowl garbage is coating the inside of your lungs, and will be working it's way out for the next couple weeks.

Finally, take that list of people out. Call each and EVERY one of them. Tell them you have decided to become a non-smoker. You have quit smoking for good and you only ask that they bare with you. You don't need them to check up on you - you are quitting for you, not for them. But **you will succeed** and break the nicotine trap. As I said before, I can't help you quit, and I won't share your **mild anxiety**. You do this for you and **you will find freedom** from ~~cancer~~ smoking.

Congrats on being a non-smoker! Now get yourself a motherfucking badge.

I was at 21 days and ran out of patches so what do I do?  Buy smokes. Pathetic. 
I figured I wasn't making any progress with my addiction to nicotine while on the patch and so when I ran out I talked myself into thinking a few smokes can't hurt till I get more patches (Costco has the best deal on them but its far from my home - I'll get there) 
Am I stuck in a loop now?  I don't see myself ever graduating to the next level of patches as the first one barely got me through the cravings.  Should I start a sub reddit for Patch Addicts?

People keep asking me how, and I guess the best answer I've come up with is this: Shitty days deserve a better reward than a cigarette.

That little voice that tells you, ""Oh shit, what a horrible day. I picked the wrong day to quit! Time to pick up a pack,"" is a jerk. Yes, you're having a shitty day. Yes, you deserve some kind of reward at the end of the day. But you deserve something *better than a cigarette.*

I had to reprogram my brain to go from ""I want a cigarette"" to ""I want a...something,"" and figuring out what that something was. A book, candy, a (legal) music download, a game or app, new clothes, a fancy dinner, whatever the fuck. I deserved something, dammit, but I deserved a shit load better than a cigarette. 

Figuring out a new reward for myself was a huge step in quitting. Also, I ate a pound or two a day of baby carrots. Just carried them around in my pocket and glared sullenly at anyone daring to give me a stink eye about it. 

A side note: two weeks into quitting, I was having a rotten day at 5 in the morning, going to work, angry at life. I was crossing the Wabash bridge here in Chicago and asked some guys for a smoke. I explained I was quitting, offered to pay, they just handed it over. I took it to a bench nearby, found a forgotten lighter in the bottom of my bag, and lit up. Holy shit, did that cigarette piss me off. It wasn't relaxing, it wasn't wonderful, it wasn't a step back to a happier time. It just pissed me off. It was my brand and everything, but I only took two drags before stomping it out on the ground. I knew I was done, and that really pissed me off too.

At days 1 through 4 (the hardest days IMO) I laughed at making it to 10 days. At 2 weeks I never thought a month could come. 

At a month now and 2 months seems very possible. 

I just want to let all the resolutioners know that it's very possible!!  This sub helps immensely...just a few pointers:

- Read the book everyone is raving about. The way he un-brainwashes you is exactly what all of zombified smokers need.

- Wait out the cravings. It will pass. DO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR BRAIN! Cravings do 1 of 2 things...pass or make you smoke one. LET IT PASS!

- Don't take quitting too seriously. Make the choice to quit and don't make a big old deal about it. I learned to shrug off the fact that I quit, even though this might be the best thing I've ever done. It takes the pressure off.


And let me tell you guys, being a non-smoker is fucking great. I used to never think it was possible to not smoke while: waking up, drinking coffee, after a big meal, before/after I shower, I pick up the phone, start driving, DRINKING ALCOHOL, before/after work, before I sleep, after sex or fapping, being stressed at work, relaxing, and the list really continues as I used to think I needed a cigarette during these times.

the self loathing when I would give in again and again, and drive to the store to buy another pack, smoke and then throw them away only to get the pack out of the trash, and if I had I wet down and I'd dry in the microwave and scotch tape the seams
or I would pull the filters off but still get them out the trash and smoke them like that, 
knowing I was doing something that was killing me.

I was an anxious wreck who depended on cigs for....  for...

Then it hit me.  Im depending on cigs for everything, including MY SENSE OF SELF?!?!
I realized the little fuckers were brainwashing me into thinking I AM THE PROBLEM, not them, never them.  I was at the point where my entire day revolved around the next smoke.  Pathetic.

So i said FUCK YOU.  And took my life back.  All the reasons i COULDNT QUIT were perpetrated by the CIGS THEMSELVES.  *When you quit, you lose the illusions that you cant quit.* 
Cigarettes are basically an ABUSIVE PARTNER that creates the problems, tries to convince you everything is your fault, and then PRETENDS to be the solution for every problem. 

They make you depressed - then tell you they are an anti-depressant.

They make you lethargic - then tell you cigs are exciting.

They make you anxious - then tell you they relax you.

They make you lonely - then tell you your special.

They make you sick - then tell you it's medicine.

They make you smelly and gross - then tell you that you're cool and suave.

They make you burn money - then tell you its worth every penny.

They fill you with doubt - then tell you cigs make you confident.

They create fear - then tell you they give you courage.

They make you impotent - then tell you they are amazing after sex.

THEY LIE TO YOU! THEY'VE CAUSED EVERY PROBLEM YOU'VE EVERY HAD WITH THEM.   IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT - IT IS THEIR FAULT!  You MUST forgive yourself, it was never your fault.  We are confronted with the 3rd MOST ADDICTIVE DRUG ever made, right behind Heroin and Crack.  And it's legal.  Pathetic.

Now, get RIGHTEOUS, and never smoke one again.  Let THAT be your fault.  It is incredibly liberating knowing you *no longer need to divide yourself into two conflicting personalities.*
But you MUST commit to HATING nicotine.  Any mental doubts will manifest themselves as physical withdrawal symptoms - this is how nicotine hooks, it's a mental parasite.

This is a BATTLE that you will WIN.  Ironically, all you have to do is IGNORE YOUR OPPONENT to claim victory!  (this actually takes LESS EFFORT than acknowledging all the withdrawal symptoms and false emotions.)  Nicotine always loses this war, because it CANNOT IGNORE YOU, and therein lies its only weakness: *It depends on your mistakes for survival.*

If you feel like your making a sacrifice, it has tricked you. You are NOT sacrificing anything by quitting! If you smoke, your sacrificing your health.   Remember, you aren't being deprived of ANYTHING.  Cigarettes have NOTHING to offer besides POINTLESS DEPENDENCY and AGONIZING DEATH. Let me reiterate:    *A.G.O.N.I.Z.I.N.G.   D.E.A.T.H.*

If you KEEP LOVING YOURSELF, and STOP FOOLING YOURSELF, you will succeed.  You are already more than strong enough to end this blight on your soul.

FUCK EM!  It's you or them. 

(note: please live a healthy lifestyle - that's *your* responsibility, and it will help you quit.) 


*TL;DR* - get ANGRY at the smokes.  HATE them for their DAMAGE and LIES.  And QUIT happily.

I always smoked a pack a day until the last 2 years when i started smoking 2 packs a day. I am 28 years old now so I had been smoking for 11 years! I quit smoking using the nicotine patch method, I have been off the patch for a week now. I never thought I could honestly do it without some help weening off the nicotine with the aid of patches, gum, etc. My wife does not smoke but my workplace is full of smokers and all of my co workers constantly going outside for smokes and conversations. I found that most of the quitting process was being ready to give it up. You would not believe how much I have been tested in the last 63 days to go to the store and buy a pack. I have had everything from major family drama stress to deaths in the workplace, and every time I have been tempted I realize how smoking won't make me feel better because in fact it will make me feel worse. I also give credit to my kids (who are both 6) for giving me the drive to quit. For those of you trying to quit look at all the benefits: no ashes, no stinky smoke, no smokers teeth, no coughing or weezing, no lung cancer, smells are regained, taste is regained, save $$$$ and save years of your life.

It was long, and drawn out, with just a tinge of sadness at what I thought I would be missing out on.

The first week was abysmal. I warned everyone that I'd be... crabby. Due to going cold turkey I let my kids school know that everything would be a bit over emotional over the next few weeks. I chose the most low interaction jobs at work so I could hide away from snapping at people. 


I tried my first night out, had a drink or two. But found that my resolve didn't falter. I remembered the list I had written to remind myself the reasons why I had quit, and found it easier to resist. 

I kept my rolling tobacco and papers in my bag, in my pocket, and generally around my person, and told myself I was choosing not to smoke. I mean, I could smoke anything I wanted to, the stuff was right there! But I was choosing not to do so. I was choosing to be healthy and happier.

Okay it hasn't solved all my problems. I now eat even more crap than I used to (not as a mouth fixation problem, more of a lack of self control problem. ) I tell people that I used up all the willpower I ever had by quitting smoking. It's a funny laugh to mask the real problem. Maybe one day I'll get there.

About a month ago I wanted to smoke again so badly it shocked me. But I got through it. The most frustrating part is when people who still smoke tell me 'Oh yes, I quit for 2 years once, but now I'm back on them'. Why do that? Why plant that seed of niggling doubt?! Oh, and I still get phlegmy and coughing. I would have thought that would be over but apparently not. 

It got better over the course of the year. Wow, a year.  How amazing is that! It's still not perfect, I still check my bag for my 'phone, purse, fags, keys. I still think 'Perfect time for a ciggie' after being in the cinema or enclosed areas for a long time. Maybe that'll never leave, maybe I'll always have those thoughts. 

But I have made an amazing choice that benefits me, my children, my family, and the way I look at life. Life is too precious to spend it hacking up phlegm and cutting time off of your life, now and later.

When you stop adding wood, the fire doesn't die instantly from just that.

Craving is the feeling of the fire growing weaker.

For what it's worth: The first 60 days or so my body coughed up a lot of shit, but I honestly can't remember being sick since I quit!

My 2 cents? If you're like me - all your friends continue to smoke cigarettes. Don't give up those little breaks/social sessions! Go outside with them every time. Fold your arms and just enjoy the company. The biggest mistake I made when I used to ""try"" quitting was sitting alone inside while everyone else went out to smoke a cigarette - there's a big social angle you're missing trying it that way! Get used to turning down the offer for a smoke, but being enthusiastic about going out to be a part of the session. Might not be for everyone, but worked well for me. 

I know it gets said again and again. But do or don't quit. There is certainly no try. Decide you are not going to be a smoker anymore, anything less and you'll continue to delude yourself. The hardest part is making the decision to be a non-smoker instead of kidding yourself by ""trying"" to quit. 

There will be times that you're pissed off or frustrated and ready to give up, buy a pack, and give up... Why??? Because fuck the world and everyone else, that's why!! This was my most dangerous trigger, but don't kid yourself! It's all about you. You don't smoke out of anger or frustration just like you heave a brick through your windshield when you're pissed that you got a ticket!

I haven't had a single puff of even a bummed cigarette these past 100 days. I haven't kept myself from not being around friends who actively smoke in front of me.

- Went cold turkey on May 9th, 10:15am.  Never touched another cig, no patches, no gum, no dip.  I was getting close to 3 packs/day.

- Quite easily the best decision of my entire life.  I started running and lost 20 lbs.  Went from barely being able to walk up 3 flights of stairs without getting tired to running my first half marathon on Saturday.

- Anger started about 1 week in and lasted about 5 weeks.  Yeah, it took a while, and it was tough, but its completely gone.  If you're feeling agitated and upset, just know it does NOT last forever.

- Fatigue started about 1 week in and lasted about 3 weeks.  I was tired and foggy.  Didn't last too long.

- I work in the service industry.  I don't make much.  The last 6 years of my life has been living paycheck to paycheck.  I quit smoking, now I dont have to check my bank account to go get lunch, or grocery shop, or go out on a date.  It fucking rules.

- 90% of my friends smoke.  I work at a bar.  Not one person has given me shit for quitting.  In fact, most people congratulate me and say they're trying hard also.

- I still get cravings.  Some are intense, mostly not.  Maybe 1 every 2-3 days.  Never last more than 30 seconds.

Not to say it didn't work for some people - it clearly did. More that I assumed, perhaps arrogantly, that I would be able to see through the mind tricks it employed in order to get me to quit. A magic trick is only magical until you know how it's done. Then it's just a guy with a fake arm and a mirror.

This book is not about brainwashing. I keep seeing it mentioned alongside words such as 'miracle', 'magical' and 'amazing' which, whilst true to some extent, undermine the core value of the book. It is descriptions like these that led me to write it off for so long.

One day, I purchased the book on a whim. I think I needed to make some postage value up in an Amazon order so I thought, why not? Receiving the book didn't help with my preconceptions. The cover looks tacky. The writing style is very ""YOU CAN DO IT!!!"". I almost didn't bother.

The book is repetitive and poorly written. I couldn't put it down. Allen Carr is a genius.

The beauty of this book, which people in general seem to miss, is that all it does is tell it how it is. For years, I knew I was addicted. I couldn't deny that. But I did not know why. I assumed that, whilst nicotine was indeed rather moreish, the addiction came from the fact it was so awesome. One by one the book breaks down the psychology behind the truths you believed so absolutely. Beliefs which you never questioned since they seemed so obvious. Beliefs which kept your junkie mind continuing to allow you to smoke.

The basic premise behind the book is that you are addicted to nicotine. Not the physical act of smoking. ""Bullshit!"", your mind exclaims. You read on in the book, thinking about each point and example. No matter how hard your desperate mind fights for a valid counterpoint, there are none. Not if you are honest with yourself and really consider the arguments made.

The main point I didn't realise before reading the book was how nicotine addiction actually works. The idea that all non-smokers are at a default level of ""stress"" whilst a smoker spends 90% of their time over this line was horrifying to me. A cigarette will briefly bring the smoker back to near a ""normal"" level before steadily increasing the stress levels until the next fix. It makes so much sense. It provides answers to the many paradoxes of smoking. This book provides great reasons for why every belief you have about smoking stems from being an addict. Social smokers included.

I could go much further into the book, but the simplest thing if you're trying to quit smoking would be to just read it yourself. You won't regret it. It's simple to justify reasons for failed quits when you don't understand how addiction works. Reading this book will arm you with the tools to understand exactly why you feel like you do with regards to nicotine and help you in the fight to break free.

It is not this book that is the magic trick. It is smoking itself.",,False,,t5_2rbuf,False,,,True,t3_jhnsu,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/jhnsu/allen_carrs_book_the_easy_way_to_stop_smoking_is/,

But I thought once - does it makes sense? Wouldn't be nice to smell nice? Wouldn't be nice to spend all that money for something else? And finally, even if I don't bother about smell, money, health, is it so good to smoke? And I've decided to quit. I tell myself that this just don't make sense to smoke and I set a date - in 10 days, April 1st, I quit smoking without any nicotine gums or anything else, even if this tastes good and I feel awesome when I smoke.

And it was surprisingly easy to never smoke again. For 29 years everybody, everywhere told me that it's so hard to quit. The ads where trying to persuade me that I will not be able to quit just like that. It's like everyone is convinced that it is so hard to quit, that I believed in this.

Short summary: I stopped on June 1st, 2011, only seconds before 9pm. I was smoking about one pack of tobacco a day (50 grams, roughly 50 to 60 cigarettes), I did smoke for the last 13 years. I stopped cold turkey, while taking four days off from work.

Reading through /r/stopsmoking for the first couple of days and weeks was a tremendous help for me, since most of us struggle with similar issues and it helped me to understand my behaviour much better. Thank you all so much for that!

From the beginning, the a burning question for me was: How do you feel after the first year? Was it worth it? Do you still struggle? Do you still crave tobacco? Unfortunately, very few people tried to answer these question, so I made a promise to myself: If I was going to make it to one year, I’ll try my very best to give my fellow quitters a in-depth analysis on how you feel after the first year.

So here I am! Meanwhile, I do understand why so few people bother to explain how you feel about smoking: It just doesn’t matter anymore. I guess the easiest and shortest explanation would be: While it takes effort *not* to smoke for you right now, after one year it now would take effort from me to smoke. It’s just no longer a habit, it’s something I /used to/ do and I would have to *start* (again) now. 

So, I am a non smoker now, right? No, I’m not. I’m an ex smoker. While smoking no longer plays a relevant role in my life, I still remember “good times”, even if those were illusions. I know that a single cigarette will bring back all the bad habits again. 

For me, going back to smoking would be much more than just buying a pack and lighting one up. It would destroy all progress I made in the last year, like smelling better (in both meanings), starting an active lifestyle, including sports and eating healthy. I even earned myself a reputation for being a health nut (you don’t know me, so - unfortunately - I can’t explain how ridiculous that still sounds to me). It would just make no sense for me to eat healthy, so sports and smoke. At least in my understanding.

When I imagined this day a year ago, I was sure to write an flaming essay on how you feel after the first 365 days of being smoke free. I realize now that it’s much harder to do, if you aren’t using your native tongue. And it’s even harder if you realize: It’s just no longer a relevant issue. I’m not even able to remember /when/ it stopped being an issue. 

So don’t worry, stay strong a couple of days longer. 
If I’m going to make the next 5 years smoke free, I’ll be back. :-)",,False,,t5_2rbuf,False,,year1,True,t3_ug18b,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/ug18b/first_year_id_like_to_honour_a_promise_i_gave_to/,

I was thoroughly addicted. It was the hardest damn thing in the world to quit. I mean it took 50 failed attempts before I FINALLY got my ass in gear and quit. I stopped smoking cigarettes for about 4 years. I had it licked, I did. 

Well flash forward to about 2 months ago. A friend of mine was smoking a cigarette, I had been drinking a bit and just casually took the cigarette from them and smoked a few puffs of it. 1 cigarette turned into another the next day. Then it was 2, then it was 3, then I was buying a pack, then I was hooked again. It hit quick, I never thought it would happen again but it did. I just bought a pack today, smoked 2 out of it and got so fucking disgusted that I cut the rest of the pack up. Its going to suck to quit again but I fucking hate this habit. 

My word of warning is this. Once you are a smoker, you are always a smoker, it doesn't matter how long you go without smoking, you are always a smoker. I watched it happen to my sister and brother in law, they quit for almost a year and then they were right back on it. It happened to me after 4 years. Once you beat it, do not EVER go back. Do not flirt with it, do not pretend you can have just one. **Once a smoker, always a smoker.**

I'm in for another damn fight my friends. Wish me luck.

I've lost weight and turned fat into muscle.  Since I quit I've been walking between 4.5 to 5km everyday after living basically a sedentary lifestyle for the past decade.  I'm talking my heart would start racing taking the garbage to the curb.  I'm talking everywhere I go there would be a vulture circling in the sky knowing that it was just a matter of time.  

So today ... today I raked the lawn, mowed the lawn, walked my 5KM circuit and said fuck it and did another km including accelerating at a run up a hill (ok fine its not everest) and jogging across a large field.

Breathing and heartbeat back to normal within minutes as I kept walking at a brisk pace.

I walk through the door and announce to my wife and kids: ""It's official: I'm fucking awesome"".  I then put an exclamation point on that statement by cooking dinner and washing all the dishes like some kind of awesome motherfucker.

Now I'm sitting here watching the NHL playoffs and I swear I have so much energy and I feel so fucking awesome I could strap on a pair of skates and join them.  If you are watching the game and you see an awesome motherfucker skating on his ankles then wave hi to me.

For all of you struggling in the early days or still screwing up the courage to quit - make the commitment and stick with it and combine it with exercise and eating well and life gets so fucking awesome that I can almost not believe it.

Just fucking do it.  Say no to everything your lying fuck of a troll brain throws your way and stop smoking.  Not one puff; not one smoke and you too can be this fucking awesome.

On February 3rd, I not only quit smoking, but I quit all substances, minus the occasional night-time toke (in my opinion and experience, cannabis has less potential for physiological harm than Advil).  Alcohol, cigarettes, MDMA, hallucinogens, and various other stimulants are very common place in my social scene and became incorporated into my lifestyle.  I regularly went to school/work still feeling an afterglow from the night before or using a stimulant.

I had quit smoking for a period of about 3 months in 2013, and this is the longest I've been smoke-free since then.  But even more importantly, this is the longest time I've been free of drugs and alcohol as well since age 18.  I'm 23 now, so 4+ years is a relatively large chunk of my life.

Consistent fatigue, stomach aches, head aches, a scratchy throat, shortness of breath...all of these signs of dis-ease became my norm.  I completely lost sight of what good health felt or looked like.  I kept telling myself, one day, one day.  One day I would stop and get my shit together.  But I kept putting it off because I was scared.  A life of self-destruction (even beyond the substances) was all I had known for a really long time.  And I guess I also didn't realize just how incredibly poor my health was.  You don't realize how much these things effect you until you take them away because you become desensitized.  You build a tolerance.

And then I finally realized, what am I waiting for?  There will never be a ""last time.""  ""One day"" will never come unless I make it *today*.  My health and truly living my life is not something I can procrastinate on like an English final paper.  So I did it.  I quit it all and I feel motherfucking awesome.

I cannot begin to describe just how *good* I feel.  The first few days were a little bumpy, but it's honestly been pretty smooth sailing beyond that.  The dramatic increase in my health has been all the encouragement I need.  After just a week, my resting heart rate has dropped by at least 10 bpm, I sleep soundly, I wake up energized, I can smell, I can taste, I breathe evenly...the list goes on and on.  Plus, I'm saving tons of money.  I had no idea that I could physically feel this amazing.

Additionally, for the first time in my adult life I'm exercising to increase my strength and cardiovascular health.  And I can exercise without feeling like my heart might explode!  I struggled with an eating disorder for 8 years and have been in recovery for a while, but never got into physical fitness.  The only time I ever exercised regularly in the past was to burn calories and lose weight.  Now I'm hitting the gym and lifting weights to build strength and mold myself into a physique that reflects a healthy lifestyle.  I'm eating to fuel my body, not dieting to deprive it.

I know that was a bit of a read, so thanks for listening if you've made it this far.  I don't have many friends that would appreciate what I've just said and I wanted to share with someone.

* No more wheezing for breath.
* I can run and exercise and my lungs feel amazing.
* Girls love hearing ""No, I quit cigarettes"". It's a turn on dude.
* I can get drunk without craving a cigarette.  
* My car doesn't smell like musty smoke.
* I can smell, eat, and even think clearer.
* My family (mostly non smokers) don't give me that look anymore.
* The withdrawal is finally OVER!!!

Cons:
Basically none. 
Every now and then, usually intoxicated, I WANT a cigarette, but I know I'd never smoke it. 

I can go on forever of how awesome it feels not being dependent on squares. I went from a pack a day, to going full days without even thinking about smoking.

After you go through the process of quitting, you never want to go through the withdrawal symptoms again. So that's a good motivator if you're craving for a smoke.

I have [/r/stopsmoking] to thank for it too. You guys are the reason why I quit. Everyone's stories are inspiring and helps those who are trying to quit in check. THANK YOU!

No pills, no lozenges, no patches or hypnosis. I smoked at least a pack a day for 15 years prior. It was hard, it sucked, mostly the first week, especially the first 48 hours, but it was possible through sheer desire and will. I have now saved myself over $2500 and gained my life back. My breath, hair, clothes and hands smell better. I don't get winded walking up the stairs. I am less often late because I needed a smoke first or before I got ready. I sleep sounder at night. My eyes are less dry. I use less salt on my foods. I have A LOT more energy. I, who used to catch every virus in town, have not been sick all year. My car and porch are cleaner and I no longer have tobacco crumbs in purse or pockets. I have also saved the money (and calories) I would have also blown grabbing a soda or candy or chips every time I stepped into a liquor store to buy cigarettes. I have found better, healthier was to cope with majorly stressful situations this last year including losing my job and having to move, and I survived. I never cheated once. Not even during a trip to Vegas where nothing counts. Not one cigarette. Not one puff. 

I wanted to quit and I was ready to. That is what led to my success. Well, that and not wanting to break before my husband, who also quit, 2 weeks later. He has been 100% successful too. 

For those of you trying to quit, good for you. It is the best gift you can give yourself. Remember how powerful your own mind is. Don't even allow cheating to be an option. Don't even consider it, you will begin to justify it, and that's where the trouble starts. Compete with another quitter who you truly value the opinion of and/or loathe the idea of losing to. Quit on a Friday if you haven't yet, or take the first day or two of work if you didn't (and if you can). Get as much sleep as you can the first 48 hours to combat the withdrawals. They do go away, quicker than you think actually. And remember, you ARE an asshole those first few days, so don't make any drastic statements or decisions regarding other life matters, remind yourself you truly are NOT of sound mind right then. Get something indulgent and reward yourself when you fight an urge to smoke. Keep a running count each day of how much money you've saved. Pick something out to buy with the sixth month's or one year's total so that you have something tangible to work towards. Tell your people when you are having a craving, if they care about you they will help you distract yourself or give you at least some verbal encouragement. You can do it, you can, don't see it as impossible, see it as a decision you have already made.

Anyways, now that I'm 3 months in, and it's getting much easier I've noticed so many things I love about not smoking anymore.

- I used to stress out about where, when and how I'd smoke in any situation.  Example: Weddings, parties etc.  Always preoccupied with getting my fix instead of really enjoying anything.

- I don't smell like smoke.  I've had many people comment on that, like when I'd hug them I'd smell of smoke, and I don't know.  I never really thought of how strong the smoke smell was, since I couldn't tell.  My car also no longer smells like smoke anymore either.

- More time to eat.  It used to be if I ever had a few spare moments, I would choose a cigarette above all else... this included food.  I find it shocking thinking back, that in any given situation, I guarantee I would've chosen to smoke over eating if I could only do one.

- I used to annoy my friends when watching movies at home.  I always would stop a movie multiple times to go have smoke breaks.  Also, I'd find it hard to enjoy watching movies, because half the time I'd be thinking about going for another smoke.

- Money!  I've saved a few hundred dollars now.  Since I quit smoking I've been putting the money I would've spent on packs into a savings account.  I was originally going to buy myself something as a reward when I reached 3 months, but now I'm just thinking I'll keep saving.  

- Health.  I've noticed some changes in how I feel.  I don't run out of breathe as easily, I have more energy, and I've been actually craving to do some exercise lately.  Something I was never really motivated for as a smoker.

I wish I could say it was a good run, but lets be honest... It wasn't. Fifteen years is a long time to be with someone and not realize how destructive they are to you. We were never really meant for each other. You've got charm and charisma and you pulled me into a 15 year long web of lies!  

Now I am leaving you for good.

It has been three days since we last saw each other. In the past I would have come home crying by now. We would have embraced as soon as we saw each other. I would apologize for hurting you and trying to leave. You would comfort me by wrapping me up in a nasty cloud of poisons, making me feel light headed and slightly nauseous. 

Not anymore.

Not this time. NOT EVER AGAIN. I finally have my head on straight. I have never felt better in my life and for the first time I can clearly see that coming back to you would be the biggest mistake I could ever make, you've never done anything but hurt me. Sure you disguise it as ""helping or loving"", but we both know the TRUTH: YOU ARE KILLING ME!

As I have had time two reflect on our years together I have made a list of all the negatives and positives we have shared....

NEGATIVES:
You stink

My throat always hurts after we are together

My breath stinks when I am with you

I always feel unmotivated with you

You give me weird chest pains (not in a good or cute way)

I see you with so many others and realize what we have isn't special. You're peddling your lies to a lot of other people

All those times you made me feel cool or special, I was just blindly believing what you told me. It wasn't true. I see you with other people and know that they look stupid. And unhappy.

I am more relaxed since we broke up than I ever was while with you. You never relaxed me. You just aggravated me so much it felt like relaxation when it really wasn't.

You never let me walk for longer than a few minutes without making me feel crappy and tired. 

We can never go hiking. 

Things seem to taste bland and smell less when we're together

POSITIVES:










So you can see, this has to be. Anyway, good luck with everything or whatever. I am sure there is someone out there who is right for you, it is just not me. Not anymore. Never again.

The nearest gas station was about 700 meters away, but I would have to walk there through freezing rain/snow and very strong winds, without an umbrella. That night I told myself, fuck everything about this and decided to quit no matter what.

The first 3 months were very difficult, and I admit that I smoked a bit more weed than usual to cope with the habit of 'smoking'.

 After the 3 months however:

- I almost stopped thinking about smokes entirely. 

- Everything about my health turned for the better. 

- I slept better, 

- I had more energy, 

- I had more cash, 

- my pockets had more space,

- I could taste food much better

- I had more TIME, 

- my house was cleaner, 

- my mood swings subsided, 

- I could afford top quality cannabis

- I felt like I was doing something to make my life better

- I could run after a streetcar without almost passing out after 100 meters.

It was the third time in my life that I tried to quit. The first time was in high-school where I lasted about 11 days, the second time was in 2010 where I relapsed after about 2 months. When I relapsed after 2 months I was SOOOO pissed at myself, and made a promise that the next time would be for good. Here I am, ~800 days later and I feel accomplished. 


This subreddit empowered me, and I hope that this post pushes someone to finally commit to getting rid of this useless, derogatory, filthy and expensive habit. Anyone that has made it past 3 months has absolutely no reason to relapse. It's not worth it people!

today is a special day because 2 years ago I quit smoking. I just wanted to drop by and say hi and send all my best wishes to people who are in the process of quitting, or are thinking about it.

I smoked for 16 years, more or less a pack a day. I started when I was 15 with friends at school. I tried several times over the years to quit, sometimes with patches, but I wasn't really that motivated and always ended up buying a new pack after a few days/weeks.

4 years ago I bought the book on Allen Carr's method. I read it a few times but I still wasn't that motivated, so I failed again every time. 

2 years ago I decided that I had enough if this and said to myself that I would stop smoking. Just that. I would stop smoking and would not get any kind of nicotinic substitutes, because it would only delay the unavoidable. In the end I think that Carr's book finally had an effect on my way of seeing things.

so on october 9th, 2010 I smoked my last cigarette, and after that never looked back. Of course the first days and weeks were a nightmare in terms of keeping calm and polite, the inner fight against the craving was a tough one. But it got better and better each day, I was getting the use of my taste buds back, I wasn't having my chronic sinuses problems any more, I was breathing deeper and better... 

One of the key thing that helped me hold tight and not give up was that after a few weeks, cigarette smoke had its original smell back, the smell it had when I started smoking, when I had to get into the ""cool habit"", forcing the smoke into my lung and holding it while suppressing the coughing and fighting the dizziness... so every time I was near a cigarette smoker this memory of when I started was coming back to me, making me think ""No way I'm going back through all of this""

Only downside to stopping is that I took some weight, took 15 kgs (30lbs) in the first 5 months and since then I managed to lose 3 kgs (6lbs). But this is really unsignificant compared to the benefits of having quit! 

What I want to say today here is: if you want to quit or are in the process of quitting, it's OK if you don't succeed at first. The important thing is not falling, it's getting back on your feet. Each try is getting you closer to success. 

In my opinion you shouldn't use nicotinic substitute. The best way (obviously the best IMO since it's the one that worked for me) is to quit once and for all. You smoke your last cigarette and you're done with it. that's it. Don't make things take too much time, one day or another you'll have to quit substitutes to get rid of nicotin, so why spend more money on nicotin? just stop it!


And when you stop, make sure you get enough physical exercise! I didn't and compensated my cravings with snacks and junk food... now I have a healthy diet and do some exercise, but I wish I had taken the habit right away after quitting...

Last but not least: **you can do it!!!** who's awesome? you're awesome! believe in yourself, do not mind the bad temper you'll get for the first few weeks and do it!

Well about a week ago I looked at the calendar and realized that I only had a week to go. I quit cold turkey that day. In those 9 days my life has changed drastically but I still haven't lit up. 

In these past 9 days I have started full time with work. I used to think that the post work cigarette was one of the best parts of the day. Now I don't miss it.

I went back to my home town to visit, where all of my friends smoke cigarettes. I hung out with them outside and didn't light up a cigarette.

I've gone to bars and gotten drunk. This was probably the toughest, but somehow I've still manage to not light up a cigarette. 

I graduated with my roommate and as he lit up a post-graduation cigarette I hung outside with him on the deck and didn't smoke.

Yesterday my girlfriend and I broke up and I still haven't had a cigarette. 

For the first time in 5 years I finally feel in control. As I walked up the hill to my apartment yesterday I didn't feel winded for the first time. It was probably a placebo, but it still felt great and empowering. I'm going to start going back into the gym soon and see if I can start running again (I used to do cross country before I made the mistake of starting smoking).

My mate who I mentioned, about a week and a half ago dinged his brand new Prius on a pole. He was so mad at himself, he was only about 10 days into quitting himself, work/stress, long commutes, people breathing down his neck all day just got to him and the bingle on his car just tipped him over the edge.

So he went and bought a pack of cigs, punched like 3-4 or something that afternoon... Next morning he filled the pack with water and binned em.

The other day when we were going for a jog, he told me he'd kick himself if he could. Yeah, the stress, nerves wound up tight from nicotine withdrawals, the car crash and everything was all bad. But having those couple of cigarettes didn't make him feel any better, it didn't uncrash his car and it didn't make anything else any better at all. All it did was cost him 20 bucks (on top of the car repairs).

All I'm saying is, even if bad shit happens in those first few days after quitting, having a cigarette will not make you feel better, and ultimately it will make you feel worse.

It's that simple, for me. I had no problems as long as I didn't try to justify a reason why I could have one ciggy, or one puff.

I learned from past mistakes. This time was it.

Now - what to look forward to? Well. I put on some weight after quitting and am starting to cut that in a rigorous martial arts program, and this second smoke-free summer is going to be full of outdoor activities.

I relish the freedom from the stinky fuckers. Really - it's worth quitting just to lose that fucking pervasive smell. If you smoke now, run your ciggy fingers under some nice, hot water and whiff them fingers. How's that smell? That's what you smell like from 20 feet away. How can you wear deodorant or cologne / perfume while you smoke? It totally can't even stand up to the shitty ciggy smell.

There is freedom out there, but you will have to work for it. Make a list of reasons to quit and use that to talk yourself out of smoking. That list will not change much, and neither should your resolve to stay quit.

Quitting was made easy for me by a brief stint with the patch and reading and posting here. I attribute the initial success to those two things. 

Thanks, /r/stopsmoking for saving me $1,800 and giving me the freedom to move on with a healthy lifestyle without feeling like everything I do is worthless.

I work at a learning centre and part of my job is helping people fill out forms on computers if they are not computer literate. I was helping this one gentleman fill out an employment insurance form as he had just been laid off from his job. I could smell him the second he walked in the door. He wore the pungent stench of a heavy smoker; the smell emanated a six foot radius. As we sat and I helped him, I listened to his lungs wheeze with every breath. They sounded strained and squeezed, like they were fighting full capacity with each breath. He was such a nice guy and so appreciative of my help, and I felt so bad for him, listening to his poor body trying to function. During our friendly banter, he mentioned something about using his new found time off from work to get healthy. I mentioned, quite brazenly, ""you're a smoker"". He looked at me with a fear in his eyes that I immediately recognized and identified with. ""Can you smell it?"" he asked. I remember being so terrified that people could smell smoke from me. I would wash my hands incessantly and chew gum all the time. I know that the smell of the gum and soap just mingled with the smoke, but there was always a part of me that hoped it made it less offensive. I told him no, I couldn't smell it. I didn't have the heart to tell him the truth. I told him I could hear it in his lungs, and that I had quit eighty some days ago, and that it was the best thing I ever did. he congratulated me, but still had that fear in his eyes. The idea of losing the habit was scary, and now with no income, he would not be able to afford it. The sympathy I felt for this man was enormous, and it made me feel so glad that I've been this strong so far. I've quit smoking many times. The longest I've gone is 90 days. In a few days I'll break my record. I really hope that guy can find the strength and motivation to kick the habit. I'll always try to be an encouragement to people who are trying to quit.

I had a quit going 7 months last year and started back like many others.  A month in again now and here is  something that I have learned from my experience and from subscribing to this sub that I would like to share. 

It is about relapse, going back to the stupidity of being a smoker. 

**It is because you forget.**

Or maybe more precisely you no longer accurately remember? I know it is a slight difference, but it is still a difference.

After the cravings are down and it has been months since you smoked and you don't think about it as much, the complacency sets in **because you don't remember**:

*  How it made you weak
*  How it made you feel sick
*  How much you spent on it
*  How it made you stink
*  How it made you cough
*  How you were addicted and it was not in your control
*  How you never thought that when you had your first smoke you would be smoking a pack a day 20 years later

Never forget and try to  remember these things every day after your first month or so. And first and foremost remember **smoking sucks**.

I just don't care anymore.

What's the difference between smoking and not smoking? I still eat, I still breathe, I still sleep, have fun, drink, play games, work etc etc etc...

There really is no superficial difference besides physically picking up a cigarette and inhaling it and what a tiring thing to do... every day... so useless.

I can't put it any simpler, than just don't care. Enjoy your life to the fullest. Smoking doesn't enhance your life, it doesn't increase happiness or prosperity. What is it doing for you? Nothing. So who cares? You aren't missing out on anything :-)

Don't be discouraged by lapses. It often takes more than one try to get it right for many people.

1337506354.0,65,self.stopsmoking,tvtw3,"6 weeks, not a single urge. I'm done. Smoking is foreign to me. Here's a life hack that'll help you do the same.",closebutnocigar5,77,12,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/tvtw3/6_weeks_not_a_single_urge_im_done_smoking_is/,"**TL;DR: Pavlov. Woof woof.**

Smoked heavy (10+/day) for 3 years. I tried quitting a few times but if you half-ass it you play these stupid mind games with yourself where you pretend to resist but actually you subconsciously made the decision to light up long before. You ALL know what I'm talking about. Looking at that damn stick, you've done this over and over again but damn. A click, a swish, a flick and bam, resentment, ""Why the fuck did I do this yet again"". That wasn't even a question, you knew damn well why.

Good thing is you can stop this bullshit with some good ol' Pavlovian trickery. I found it easy to stop in the end purely because everytime I'd light up it felt abysmal. I ceased without a single 'craving' in a textbook Allen Carr fashion. Fact is you can totally switch off the part of you that is a 'smoker': that pathway in your brain that craves, smokes, feels good and *'quits'*. That part that lies in wait for the perfect moment, long after you *quit* to say ""yeah, one cigarette couldn't possibly hurt it's been so long"".

It's all about how you relate to the rush of chemicals from the hit. Going by subjective personal experience a cig is literally as powerful as a rock of crack in generating a reward pathway rush for the first brief seconds. Not necessarily a pleasant rush - but to that pathway, a rush is a rush. That's what we take advantage of: a rush of pain means ""**STOP DOING THAT DAMN IT**""



Through the tar-coated lenses of addiction it's a blissful release. When you're fed, watered, well rested, and smoking 30 of these fuckers a day you don't notice any individual cig. That's only because you're nourished! Do this little experiment for yourself  and I mean ACTUALLY do this: Stay awake a long time, let yourself get really hungry &amp; dehydrated, deplete everything. In that empty state, nourishment feels like nourishment and poison feels like poison.

Now smoke a cigarette and pay attention. Feel that? A wave rushes through your body and it feels like dysphoria, tiredness and death. That's what happens EVERY time you smoke. That's what you really feel each and every time but you don't notice it because you're so used to it that you drown it out, your brain says sure we're dying but uh... DM;HS.



Why? Everytime you've done it before, it's always paired with a positive reinforcement. Food + poison, water + poison, sex + poison, break from stress + poison, sleep + poison: these are the cues it's recieving. Each of the cues that precede the poison are hard wired as positive, the brain reasons that poison comes straight after viscerally good things therefore ""poison = good"". Whoops!

What you want to do is purely pay attention to that toxic feeling each and every time you smoke. Make a big deal out of it, a big massive hubbub. Feel angry, irate, toxified, poisoned, feel that you're rotting and decaying because you are! All this time you'd light that deathsicle up with an 'aaaaah', relief at last. No. That's how it gets you.

The reason cigs remotely have any allure after you 'quit' is because the last couple dozen memories you had of smoking consist of ""aaaaah, relief"". You need to actively go against that. Turn that illusory rush of serenity &amp; relief into a more realistic rush of pure pain, frustration and tiredness. Might take a few weeks or months, let it gradually happen. Once the mere thought of lighting up becomes detestable and actually doing so feels wretched it's time to quit: when each puff is like stepping on a lego, jumping up in pain then stubbing your toe, it's time. It's the Allen Carr method from here onwards.



A craving is not the same thing as a memory! ""I **need** a cigarette"" is a craving, ""a cigarette right now would suit this moment"" is a memory. Memories *can* trigger cravings but they don't *have* to. People confuse the two and that's why it feels like you're addicted for life even after the physical addiction is gone.

Cravings are physical, they ignore bad memories and intensify good ones to create a 'point of no return'. Once the physical addiction is gone you're left with just memories. And if all your memories are of depressing toxic waste, you bet your ass it's not going to lead to a craving.

To get past the hurdle of the physical addiction, you need something absorbing. Not to 'keep me busy/distracted' - that's pandering to the sneaky smoker in yer brain, you do not feed that bastard. The sneaky smoker is an attention whore. Stop paying it attention and it will shrivel up and die. Be *truly* busy.


**Another lifehack:** I found that drinking heavily totally switches off the physical addiction until it's totally metabolised. Down a bottle of some spirits and head to hangover land. Smoke your last cig before you go to sleep and that's that. Somehow the alcohol metabolises in such a way as to plug the neurotransmitter void left by tobacco for a few days. I'd love to know the pharmacology behind this! This might not work for everyone but it was very effective for me.

Just discovered this subreddit and wanted to offer my words of encouragement and share my story, especially since my anniversary was just a couple weeks ago. 

I had been a smoker for about 10 years and tried several times to quit.  I was never what I would consider to be a really heavy smoker.  I probably averaged about half a pack a day during the week (I didn't want to smoke at work), and probably 1-2 during the weekends.  This came after chewing tobacco for at least 5 or 6 years before that.  

In 1998 I got married to a great woman who over looked my faults.  She wasn't happy I smoked, but never pressured me to stop either.  In December of 2000, my first daughter was born and was (still is) the joy of my life.  I smoked in front of her because I figured she would never remember it when she was so little.  

But one day when she was about 18 months old, I was taking care of her by myself.  It was a beautiful day July 11th 2002.  I went outside on our deck to smoke a cigarette.  My daughter came toddling over to the sliding glass door, and watched as I exhaled the smoke. She got the biggest brightest smile on her face, pointed at em and said ""BUBBLES!!""  That broke my heart right then and there.  She thought I was blowing bubbles, while in reality I was killing myself.  To this day I still tear up thinking about it.  I decided right there that enough was enough and July 12th was my first full day of being smoke free.

It wasn't easy.  Took lots of Nicorette to quit.  But I haven't had a single cigarette since.  Each day I kept thinking if I have a cigarette now, I will have to restart my clock all over again.  To mark the occasion, each year my wife makes me a home made blueberry pie on July 12th.  My kids (who are now 9 and 11) didn't know the meaning behind ""Pie Day"" until a few years ago, but now that they do they are very proud of me.  My oldest (who I quit for) even wrote her DARE essay about me and how I quit smoking for her.

For those in the process or are thinking about quitting by lurking here, you all can do it too.  You just need to find that reason to quit, like I found mine.  If someone is forcing you to quit or giving you ultimatums, you won't succeed.  You need to do it for yourself, and hopefully that time will come before it is too late.

Once upon a time I thought they helped me deal with stress but they don't. The smokes just distract for a few minutes.

Just thought I'd share my experience,Niqalye,74,14,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1h730r/after_smoking_for_14_years_ive_been_cigarette/,"Both my parents are smokers. Growing up I was always around it, so when the opportunity to smoke a cigarette arose, I took it. Started smoking around the age of 13. 

Until recently, I smoked one full pack of Marlboro Reds a day, and like most of you... I fucking loved it.

A buddy of mine started smoking E-Cigs, the ones you buy at a specialty store, [They looked like this.](http://www.vaporultra.com/product_images/uploaded_images/stepupego-t.jpg) Now I was skeptical at first, always telling him that it wasn't gonna work and he'll be back on the real cigs in no time. Low and behold 2 months later he's cigarette free. So I threw away the Marlboros and picked up one of these e-cigs for 50 bucks. 

I haven't even had a drag of a cigarette in the past 10 months, 7 months of which I was using an E-cig. Now before any of you are like ""Hey, e-cigs aren't good for you either, that doesn't count as quitting"" (Even though no one knows for sure what the long term affects of e-cigs are) I AGREE WITH YOU. 

BUT... an E-cig is the perfect transitional lubricant between smoking and not smoking. Don't consider it a replacement for cigarettes, consider it a healthy alternative while you learn to cope with altering your smoking routines. Smoking when you wake up, after you eat etc... 

One day I left the ecig at home, I worked a full day and didn't even realize that I didn't have it. So when I got home I said screw it and put it away. haven't touched it in 3 months now. 

From my experience getting used to smoking the e-cig makes you realize that you don't NEED cigarettes. once you're on the e-cig long enough you'll realize you're not as addicted to that as you were cigarettes making it a lot easier to toss it and live the smoke free life. I love it, I don't have cravings barely at all anymore (maybe the slightest bit when I'm drinking but nothing I can't deal with)

Sorry for the long winded story but I thought I'd just try and give a rundown for anyone not strong enough to go cold turkey or sick of other alternatives. 

Feel free to ask any questions!

**tl;dr - I Quit smoking after 14 years using an E-cig. Then I quit smoking everything all together because it's much easier to stop smoking an e-cig than it is to quit smoking regular cigarettes. The ecig just makes the process a little longer, but a lot easier.**

* I miss smoking.  The cravings never go away, and I've realized that since I have quit smoking.  But just like an ex-girlfriend, just because you miss it, doesn't mean that you should go back to it. 
* When you quit smoking, you have a shit ton of dreams about smoking.  I have a smoking dream about once a week, and in the dream, I feel so guilty that I smoked a cig, but I wake up feeling relieved. 
* Sadly, I sometimes look for that major life event to start me smoking again.  Something that is so bad that I need a smoke to feel better.  I wish I would stop thinking like this, but it enters my mind about once a week
* I never thought I would make it to 100 days, and I sure as hell don't want to see that number go back to 0.  

So in all, I miss smoking so much, but I'm this far in and I can't go back now.  I also want to thank this subreddit.  Though I've only posted once in here, seeing everyone elses success stories have really motivated me.

I feel that my quitting success comes from being serious about not cheating.

I remember when I quit previously. I started sneaking in mooched ciggys from people on special occasions, then I started buying packs and only smoking a few. Soon after that, I was pack-a-day-gay for the little brown nicky dick.

Fuck it. I can't cheat. It's how it is. Not even one. 

Knowing this keeps me from smoking. I know there is no ""one ciggy"" and ""one ciggy"" means I WILL be a full time smoker. 

So what if I could get away with smoking a few puffs, or maybe a cigar, or the perfect ciggy moment presents itself? I am erring on the side of caution and just sticking with the story: ""I can't even take a puff"".

Knowing and believing, with 100% certainty, that you cannot cheat takes away the anguish. If you never take another puff, then you will never be a smoker.

**Besides. What is ONE CIGGY going to do for you? That's like trying to satisfy a raging boner with one pump. Worthless. Fuck it, fuck them.**

3. Meet any cravings with the ""why I want to quit smoking"" list.
4. Eating and enjoying it without rushing to smoke.
5. Dissociating alcohol drinking with smoking.
6. Cleaning.
7. Knowing that one smoke will destroy my plan.
8. Learning that idle time does not need to be filled with cig smoking.
9. Living vicariously through other smokers. Just because they do, does not mean I have to.
10. Remembering that the plan is to be smoke-free. Do not deviate from the plan.

This is what's been working. The exercise has been the best. What better way to compliment the switch to a healthier lifestyle than with exercise? I personally need it, as I am putting on some fats from eating, but that is nothing compared to the damage caused by smoking.

Since I'm in a rather somber mood I will skip the self-congratulatory animated gif and will instead offer some thoughts to the smokers who are lurking here.

Quitting smoking is not really about forcing yourself to abstain from something it is about realizing that you are enslaved and deciding that you want to be free.  It is about firmly accepting that there is no such thing as one cigarette.  Believe me - I quit for five years and swore I would never go back and then thought I could have just one.  Like an alcoholic who has abstained for a while and now thinks he is ""in control"" I was quickly back in the grips of my addiction.  

The simple fact is that each and every cigarette you smoke is a vote.  A vote for what you ask?

Let's add some music appropriate for the gravity of the decision that faces you.  If you will, please place a cigarette on your desk in front of you and open and start [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBe2jmOM9JI) in another tab.  Don't bother with what it is, just start it.  Seriously.  Have done so?  Good - let's open our eyes.

Now that cigarette in front of you represents not just itself but thousands more.  This is truth and you know it.  Look into *your* future and see a mound of butts ten feet tall.  Imagine in fast-forward **all** of them passing through your lips, the toxins washing into your blood via your lungs.  *Feel* your accelerating aging as your body is unable to keep up with the onslaught and withers before its time.  Imagine that skyscraper full of smoke that has been exhaled through your lips.  How many thousands of trips to the gas station or the convenience store await you?  ""and a pack of .... please""  Handing over your hard-earned money.  Followed by that familiar rip of the plastic cover, the pulling out of the tinfoil insert.. thousands upon thousands of times.

That is not just one cigarette in front of you is it?  To smoke *that one cigarette* is to give an unwilling nod to the above.  When you dip your head to your lighter you are bowing to your addiction.  Are you not sick of this servitude?  Are you still willing to play the cat-and-mouse game that is what you know to be true vs the delusion of your addiction?

It's all right there - right in front of you.  Wrapped in bright white paper.  You can stress about it and believe that smoking is going to help with that stress or you can choose to be free and welcome with tremendous relief each and every moment of withdrawal for it is a small price to pay for your freedom.

When you get right down to it, you don't actually *like* anything. Chocolate, ice cream, sex, etc. - you don't like those things. You like *dopamine*, the simple organic chemical at the base of the reward-driven learning system of the brain.

Smoking is addiction to nicotine; nicotine floods your brain with dopamine. And that is why it is easy to justify ""liking"" smoking. You don't actually like smoking *at all*. You only like the dopamine.

Thing is, you get dopamine from lots of things. It's just really simple to light up a cigarette and enjoy that quick dopamine fix. But since you've trained your brain to expect that fix on demand, you've got to untrain your brain. Your brain does not want you to do this.

Nicotine addiction is particularly insidious, especially with the way it manipulates your brain towards acquisition of more nicotine. I'm fairly certain all smokers have experienced something similar to the following, but perhaps were unable to recognize exactly what occurred.

You attempt to quit smoking, which suddenly triggers your brain to desire that which you have decided you cannot have. You go about your way, seemingly able to overcome via willpower all the niggling things that happen throughout the day. Then, at some point something happens that just hits you the wrong way - things have piled up such that you know that ""just one cigarette"" would make it all better.

Yeah, your brain just pulled a jack move on you. Here's where most people disconnect and fail to consider what has **actually happened**.

You see, your brain is kind of a dick. Ever since you decided not to smoke, your brain has allowed your nicotine addiction to subconsciously construct a narrative detailing all the subtle ways it knows how to convince you to smoke ""just one cigarette"". It builds barricades and bunkers, a subconscious framework into which one single, tiny, inconsequential detail can fit: that one moment where everything seems to come to a head - you're ""having a bad/stressful day"". Suddenly, the idea of ""just one cigarette"" sounds like a fuckin' **brilliant** idea!

Yeah, it's really hard to argue against because of all these other ancillary reasons that you suddenly consider, but don't remember ever actually thinking! Your nicotine addiction hijacked your shit behind your back - a different bridle in the horse's mouth while you're holding the reigns. Like I said, your brain is a dick.

That, friends, is why quitting smoking is so hard. Your brain actively works against you without your conscious acknowledgement in order to rid itself of the horrible asshole preventing it from acquiring nicotine. That ""horrible asshole"" is you.

Just let your brain be a dick for a little while longer. And just like most dicks, it will shut up for now. Eventually forever.

And then, before you know it, you'll only remember being a smoker when you actively consider it. You beat your brain into submission; it now kowtows to your desires. Your brain is no longer a dick. Suddenly, your brain's pretty cool! You guys should hang out.

But until then, tell your brain to shut the fuck up--you quit smoking, dammit.",,False,,t5_2rbuf,False,,week3,True,t3_zgudi,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/zgudi/you_are_not_your_brain/,

We travel a lot, usually 16, 10, 9 hour flights, and lay overs in different countries.

Then doing 11 hours in a plane with no smoking would make me miserable to travel with! Whenever we would land - even if the next plane we needed to board was leaving in half an hour - regardless of the language the signs were in - I'd have to leave the rush to leave the gate, or find an area that permitted smoking, even if we couldn't read the signs. before miserably boarding another plane for 2-3 hours! 

Italy was the first time we've traveled since I quit smoking - and **holy shit** the time we save is incredible. I can actually shop for souvenirs and have a look at the scenery and planes taking off - and travel at a more lax and calm pace instead of being in a  complete panic over when my next nicotine fix will be!

These are some epiphanies, realizations and lessons I learned after I quit. If this helps even just one person quit, I'd be happy. 

I recommend Allen Carr's book to anyone that is determined to quit smoking. Although, Carr continually stresses to not quit before finishing the book, I found that I stopped well before the end of the book, and I didn't even finish the reading the entire book.

The book is helpful in putting many things into perspective, and ultimately it's a perspective that subconsciously you already were aware of but just afraid to explore. It will help you view your addiction AND the behaviors associated with it from a different angle.



##Here's my advice and this is what I tell everyone who is a smoker that's tried to quit and failed in the past.



**You're Not Just Addicted, You're A Drug Addict.**

You're not a bad person, you're just an addict. Like a for real drug addict. Like you're no different than a meth, heroin, oxy, whatever addict. Your life is defined by the incessant need to reward your brain with nicotine within certain time intervals. Your life is controlled not by you, but by one of the most efficiently addictive substances on earth: nicotine. Realize you will forever be addicted to nicotine. Even if you stop smoking for 5, 10 , 20 years. You will always be addicted to nicotine. That will never change. Understand this. Accept this. Learn to live with this concept. You can never have just one cigarrette. Forget special occassions, stressful moments, being super drunk, etc. Think of cigarettes like a good friend that died suddenly.  There one day, gone the next. No time to say goodbye. You had good times, but it's over now. You can never see them again and that's ok. It's time to move on. 

**You're Paying A Corporation To Kill You.**

The most important part of your being, what makes you you and what drives your decision making is being manipulated by chemicals - poison is a more accurate word - that a corporation (which cares naught for your well-being, safety, and happiness) manufactures for the express purpose of getting you addicted in order to take your money on a regular basis. You are essentially a puppet. A drone. In the matrix, so to speak. You're paying someone to kill you slowly. Death by a thousand cuts and you're gladly paying good money for each of those cuts. Screw these multinational corporate pigs. Think about those around you, that care about you, that want nothing but the best for you. They want you healthy and happy. The cigarette companys only care about your money and your utility as a returning customer. A slave. They don't care about you, they hate you. You kill the things you hate, right? They're killing you and making a healthy profit. That's adding insult to serious injury. 

**Your Brain Can Convince You Of Anything.**

Your brain's essential function is survival at all cost; keeping you alive is job numero uno. Nicotine short-circuits this instinct. You know smoking causes cancer and will probably kill you. That it ravages your body and shortens your life span. You know these things, your brain is aware of these dangers, yet like clockwork it requests another dose of poison. You wouldn't drink bleach every hour, would you? Of course not, you can die from that. Yet, your brain demands you poison yourself 15 - 20+ times a day and you do it. 

Like I mentioned before, your brain is basically at the mercy of it's nicotine addiction and will make you justify any action in pursuit of it's little reward. Think of your brain as a con-man. A really good grifter. A silver-tongued devil that can convince you any action you take that results in getting a cigarette in your mouth is justifiable. Anytime this starts to happen (and it will), immediately stop and ask yourself: Is this regular brain or con-man brain talking?  Con-man brain wants me to inhale poison, again. Con-man brain doesn't care if I live or die a painful death struggling to breath. Should I listen to con-man brain? Start thinking in these terms and you'll begin to realize that what you think are the involuntary actions of addiction are actually very voluntary and controllable. 

**It's Hard To Quit Smoking. No It's Not.**

It's hard to change a behaviour, without knowing the real root cause of that behavior and how it relates to you. I need a cigarrete during my morning coffee,  on my drive to work, during my work break, after lunch, after dinner, while I'm drinking with friends, at the bar, after sex. I NEED it. No you don't. You don't need it. You'd like it. You like doing it.  But that isn't the same as needing it. You NEED oxygen, you don't NEED to smoke. Understanding this distinction is key. You don't NEED it and you can live your life perfectly fine without doing it, and you know why?  Because you were able to perform all these tasks before you started smoking. Remember you weren't always a smoker. You lived a smoke free life once and you can do it again. 

Quitting is about control. It's that simple. Control of your mind. Who are you going to allow to control your mind? Yourself or the nicotine? Would you allow anyone but yourself to control your mind? Are you a slave? No of course, not. Is nicotine making you act like a slave? Yes it is. Think about it in these terms. 

Quitting is easy. It really is. It's easy if you understand why you're quitting and what to expect when you quit. It's easy if you realize the real battle is not between you and your ""habit"" of smoking, your ""like"" of smoking, your ""need"" to smoke. It's a battle between the receptors in your brain that are requesting nicotine vs the rest of your mind and body who are not. All you need to do is to learn to recognize this and respond by saying, NO. I won't let you determine my actions anymore. I won't let you convince me that I can't change my behavior. It's just noise. Like a spoiled child crying for a toy. It's. Just. Noise. That pang for a smoke is just a temper tantrum your brain is throwing and you are strong enough to say NO. The more times you say NO, the easier it becomes. The quietter it becomes. Eventually there is silence. 

**If I can do it, you can do it.**

I was lucky to find it and I want everybody else to get to see it too,baby_corn_is_corn,65,6,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/xnyiz/when_this_was_first_posted_there_were_only_1990/,"This is what you need to do:
Smoking is shitty. We all know that. It stains your teeth, lips, and fingers. It smells absolutely disgusting (I know disgusting is subjective, but I've never heard of someone saying that smoke smells good), and it leaves that smell on almost everything you come in contact with. It lowers your physical abilities, increases your chances of heart disease and cancers. But the worst part: it's fucking expensive. If you smoke one pack a day, you're going to be spending over $1500 a year on cigarettes. And for what? Those 5 minute breaks every hour? Not worth it.

You have to convince yourself that smoking is bad, wrong, etc and that you don't want to do it anymore. I mean, you obviously don't want to do it anymore or you wouldn't be here, right? So stop smoking. Seriously. Look at your pack of cigarettes right now. Open it up. Look at the cigarettes. Look at them. Seriously, stare them down. Those skinny little life-fuckers are going to kill you. And they aren't even going to be quick about it. They're going to make you smell like an ashtray, run up your heart rate, and make your skin pale. You don't want that. Fuck those things. Seriously. Well, not literally, but seriously - hate them. You hate cigarettes now. Slam the pack shut. Now! Throw the pack against the wall. Be pissed! Fuck cigarettes! Fuck that shit! You're better than that!

Feeling angry yet? If not, reread the last paragraph until you're pissed off at cigarettes. If so, good. You're almost there. Now you just need to make up a plan. It isn't a plan to quit smoking, it's a plan to keep doing all the things you did when you quit. Your 5 minute breaks are still possible. You can take a breather. Only now you'll actually be breathing. Go to a quiet place on your breaks. Go away from the smokers. You can meet up with them another time, but right now, on your break, it's your time. It isn't time for those nasty little cigarettes either. Take deep breaths. Focus on the trees. Focus on the sky. Listen to the birds. Hell, listen to the cars whizzing by on the road. Focus on something else and let your mind wander. Don't even think about those piece of shit cigarettes. Think about yourself just wandering around the forest, all by yourself, with no one else. Not even a squirrel. And sure as fuck no goddamn cigarettes. You're on your own now. And you can handle it. You're a redditor, for Christ's sake. We raised half a million dollars for underprivileged kids. We helped Egyptians take back their country. You're a part of something bigger. You're not the voluntary customer of a product that will physically and financially harm you, and probably kill you. You are fucking awesome.

How do you feel now? Empowered? Can you take on the world? Can you kill a bear? Can you feed millions? I bet you fucking can. But guess what - you don't have to! You just have to quit smoking. And that shit is fucking easy. Millions of people have already done that shit. Smoking sucks. You know it too! Just think about how pissed off you were at those stinky little fucking pricks. You can do this. Carpe diem! Sieze the day! Then fuck it! Fuck smoking! You can do whatever the fuck you want!

Now go be a badass!

Of course, any day where I don't smoke is a day worth celebrating!  Having these milestones really help to reiterate to me that what I am doing really is worth it.  Being able to exercise without getting winded.  Being able to breathe deeply without coughing up a lung.  Being able to smell things, taste things I couldn't before.  And MOST importantly, being able to get through the most difficult of times without picking up a cigarette.  If you're new, one of the tougher concepts to get is that quitting smoking actually reduces your stress levels, it doesn't increase it.  I sure as hell don't miss going out to a restaurant to eat and being more concerned with how many smokes I can get in rather than what's on the menu; leaving my wife or friend sitting inside waiting on me, only to return smelling like a dirty ashtray.  So glad those days are long gone.  800 days today!  Makes me want to jump up and shout!  I'll settle for a job interview today, knowing I'll go in there not stressing and not stinking!

Its been 6 months since I inhaled any combusted matter intentionally.

Which leads to an interesting question - Have I  stopped smoking?

The clear answer is yes. Some people in this sub would disagree. 

Why would you quit smoking? For me, its avoiding hundreds of chemicals, many of them carcinogenic, damaging my lungs, and because my health was beggining to suffer - couldn't climb stairs, etc.

I've chosen to do this (and i've tried the gum, the patch, the gum, the inhaler, no chantix because it doesn't mix with my other more important medications and its an abomination that the FDA let it onto the market the way they did) with e-cigarettes, and its worked.

**So my real question -**

What is the point of this sub? Is it harm reduction (SNUS would count towards that as well, its markably less harmful than combustion)?

Is it total abstinence from nicotine (and apparently all drugs) as some on this sub would have it?

Is it to support people who want to do any of the above, and keep them from smoking?

I notice a lot of 'cold turkey' pride, my way or the highway, and its a bit of a turnoff. Not only did what worked for you not work for everyone, you're dismissing countless valid methods of quitting combusting tobacco, an incredibly harmful habit. I've quit cold turkey, lasted about 6 months, but I never felt the need to lord what I was able to do over others. 

Which is good, because it didn't stick. I'd been smoking a PAD for over 10 years before I found e-cigs, and you know what?

I'm not going to quit nicotine. Its not my intent. Much like caffiene, it is a fairly harmless chemical that I enjoy imbibing. But I'm not going to smoke again.

So why are you here, and where do you fall?

Thanks for reading. I will probably be linking this post to the electronic cigarette sub at some point, if theres an influx of fresh faces you don't recognize.

I was 16 at the time.  I've tried to quit at least once a year for 7 years.  But the first year I hated how Zyban made me feel.  The second year I forgot the lesson of the first.  The third year was mostly just a nice thought (considered getting the quit smoking shot but never did).  The fourth year I used the patch and got all the way from January to April before I picked it back up from my sister-in-law.  The fifth, same thing but made it to June when buying my first house became stressful and I didn't know where else to turn.  The sixth, same thing, all the way to July when I had a super important visit from my Regional Vice President.  Last year I took a year off from ""trying"".  So here I am in year seven.

I quit in cliche style by giving up on New Years Day.  Slapped a nicotine patch on my arm, opened a bag of twizzlers and said to myself ""This is the year.  I'm tired of this and want more play money for video games!""  And then came last night and my noticing of the difference.

My wife has decided to quit smoking in her own way which includes having a pack of smokes at the office.  Fine, whatever works.  But she brought said pack home last night.  After she went to bed, my first thought was 'Hey, I can go grab one and she'll never know.'  Every other year I've tried to quit, getting a smoke in hasn't been about failing, it's been about sneaking one and hoping no one else notices.  But last night as the thought popped into my head, I realized that the only person I'm sneaking around on is myself.  

And then something came back to me from this sub.  Someone posted a picture of Yoda a couple of weeks ago with the quote ""No.  Try not.  Do.  Or do not.  There is not try.""

She'd been sick for a while. By the time doctors found the lung cancer, it had become everything cancer, and, while there were points it looked better, a toll was certainly taken by surgeries on her lungs, liver, brain (x2), and several others I can't remember.

It was a main motivating factor behind me (eventually) quitting -- I dropped a near pack-a-day habit about a month ago, but slipped briefly two weeks ago.  (I've been going strong with quitting ever since, but that's not the point.)

Today, it was a weakened immune system that got to her. She had a blood infection and just told the doctors she was done with the super antibiotics they were pumping into her. She died, peacefully, a few hours ago.

I found out about it while I was at work, and my first thought, upon hearing that cigarettes had killed my aunt, upon hearing that my grandparents would have to bury their daughter, that my dad would have to speak at his own sister's funeral -- was that this would be a great excuse to bum a smoke from a co-worker.

That's fucked up guys, and it's how fucked up I'm discovering psychological addiction can be. I didn't smoke one, and I'm glad. I'd have felt wonderful for a few minutes, but then what? I'm realizing that it's not really about me.

It was never enough to quit ""for me""; I simply did not give enough of a shit. It took an aunt without any hair for me to think about quitting, and it took falling in love to give me a reason to care about being around past 40.

I'm sure that's not the case with everyone, but if you don't have a reason to quit, you will. One day, who the hell knows when, but it'll come, you'll look back, like my aunt had to today, and wonder what you'd get to do with all that extra time.

So you don't have a girlfriend right now -- one day you'll miss your grandkids graduate kindergarten. So you don't have a big goal right now -- one day you won't get to finish your novel. So your brother doesn't have any kids yet -- one day you'll miss your nephew's wedding.

Because you felt like smoking.

That's my motivation. If it helps you, I'm so, so glad. If it doesn't, well, at least you know why I'll never put a cigarette in my mouth for the rest of my life.


**tl;dr: If you're thinking about breaking down and having a smoke, don't. If not for yourself, then for all the people you'll be leaving behind far too soon.**

I've quit twice, first time was because my best friend got pregnant and we quit smoking together, second time was because I was broke and had no choice. Both lasted a few months then I'd start up again. The first two times I didn't want to quit, and made a huge deal out of it, because I felt like I was suffering a loss. I realize now that I actually didn't ever like smoking, I just thought I did. After thinking for awhile I realized how much I actually hate the taste, hate the smoke, hate the way it made me feel. It's been almost too easy, I haven't craved one at all. I feel more energized already and I'm loving it. I know I'll never smoke again.

I'm proud of myself. I've told a few people that I quit including my mom,  best friend, boyfriend, and sister. I waited to tell them until I'd gone three days without, because at that point I was having doubts. No one seemed to care at all. I've only gotten ""oh that's cool"" then they act like I never even said anything. I shouldn't need praise from them, but I don't know, I guess I wish someone would be proud of me other than myself, because this is a big deal to me.

For anyone looking to quit, here are my tips that might or might not help you.  

* Tell your friends ahead of time, tell them you'll be on the edge, and if they are good friends, they'll take care of you and help you along the way.

* For the times I usually go for a smoke break, I either kept myself busy, or I went for a 3-5m walk.

Find something that can focus your mind away from them. Set yourself continuous goals to beat. Maybe you want to get in better shape. Maybe you want to save for something to either spoil yourself or your love ones.

On monday i decided to quit this stupid habit. I am 26 years old and i used to smoke 1 pack a day and my method to quit was cold turkey.
One of my main reasons to stop smoking is the need to carry on with a healthy life. Smoking takes most of my apetite resulting in a really low weight. Apart from this, other reasons is my girlfriend and obviously the expense of buying cigarettes. As most of you said, i try to realize the concept of the attempt to smoke 1 cigarette will blow all my efforts, and that is making me remain strong about quitting. 
It's not easy though, i still struggle with carving in situations like after a meal, taking a break from work or in stressful situations.
Next monday i will start to go to the gym and i hope to psychologically realize that with time i am a non-smoker for ever.

To finish i just want to say to all of you to remain strong and that one of my biggest motivations that i didn't mentioned before is you. I am amazed by your stories and accomplishments. Keep strong!

I caved and tried to smoke one after dinner last night (after meals is when my cravings hit the hardest), but I couldn't even finish it. It tasted disgusting and I threw 3/4 of it away. Haven't touched one since, including the hardest one the first thing in the morning on the way to work.
 
Unfortunately my two roommates also smoke, but I had no problem going outside and hanging out with them last night without having another overwhelming urge to smoke. I obviously had a little craving, but just reminding myself that is provides me absolutely no benefit was enough for me. I'm hoping in the next couple of weeks I can convince them to stop with me.

It was very expensive and made me feel really stupid for doing it to myself.

I didn't read Alan Carr, I didn't take pills, I put down the tobacco (and other smokable items) after 15 years and haven't touched them since. Honestly the first month or so was a living hell. I flipped out on my best friend at the time (haven't spoken really since), Went nuts on my birthday shortly after and in general was really depressed for three weeks. Then like magic almost exactly three weeks to the day of quitting it cleared up and it seemed like there was a different person acting in my shoes. I didn't have the experience that many of you guys report though about instantly being able to run miles after quitting. It has taken this entire year of slow progress to build up my cardio to be able to go for a long bike ride. And I'm a skinny guy.

Overall though transforming that 1 day star to the smiley face wasn't so bad. It got easier every day and now at this point I can't see myself going back.

1360027022.0,48,self.stopsmoking,17wjcs,Why I hate smoking: written while I was still smoking.  I've never heard anyone express it like this -- can anyone else relate?,MaliceRhino,57,9,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/17wjcs/why_i_hate_smoking_written_while_i_was_still/,"About a week ago, a non-smoker asked me why said that smoking ruins a person's quality of life.  This was the first time I put my feelings about it into writing.  Today, I break the habit.  Here is what I wrote:

&gt;First I'll address the feelgood factor, then the impact on a smoker's quality of life. There are two components to each.  
The physical feelgood aspect is completely foreign to a non smoker such as yourself. If you were to smoke a cigarette now in any situation in which a smoker might perceive a benefit, there would be none for you. Examples of these situations include feeling stressed, feeling bored, or feeling physical withdrawal from nicotine.  
When a smoker feels physical withdrawals, this causes stress that only a cigarette (only nicotine really) can relieve. After repeatedly relieving this particular stress with a cigarette, a smoker's brain makes a general association between stress relief and cigarettes, not just withdrawal-induced stress. Your brain has no such association, so a cigarette wouldn't relive any stress that you might experience. Similarly, since the rate at which is smoker's body processes nicotine causes them to want to re-administer nicotine roughly once each hour, a smoker will associate relieving restlessness with smoking, so they might smoke more when caught in traffic, waiting for class to start, etc. A non smoker's brain hasn't made that connection.  
The most legitimate way in which smoking might make a smoker feel good is going outside with the other smokers to socialize and get social validation or feel like part of a group that has a commonality (that unifying characteristic is addiction). This is totally unnecessary, since you as a non-smoker don't need an excuse to enjoy the company of your friends/classmates/coworkers.  
So essentially, the feel good aspect is a complete sham, and instead of cigarettes offering additional good feelings, they only create an additional void in a smoker's life that shouldn't be there in the first place. As the only thing that can fill this void, they paradoxically solve the problem and cause it to inevitably reappear an hour later.  
Now, on to how it affects the smoker's quality of life:
You're already aware of the most obvious ways in which it subtracts from a smoker's quality of life, which are the physical and external effects. Calling cigarettes poison is not hyperbole. The lungs, heart, liver, skin, and probably other organs I'm not even aware of are damaged by the smoke. Smokers will never be able to achieve the same level of physical fitness that they would if they weren't smoking.  
I'm sure you're also aware that smokers smell bad, they have yellow teeth, they cough and spit and are generally not as attractive sexually or in any other way.  
Even beyond the physical unattractiveness, the fact that a smoker has lost a degree of control over their own lives, in that their schedules and finances and behavior are dictated to them by a chemical, is not an attractive quality in a person. And THAT leads into the most nefarious way that nicotine affects quality of life.  
Most smokers have tried to quit, probably more than once. Often a lot more than once. Even the ones who haven't tried for whatever reason don't want to be smokers once they realize that they're addicted.  
Here is where it gets personal. This is what I truly hate about smoking. I've never heard anyone else say it but I think it must not be a unique experience.  
I've told myself I was going to quit dozens of times. Every time I smoke again after promising that the last cigarette would be my final one, I betray myself. I cheat my future self out of time, money, and energy. I make promises to myself and then break them. Sometimes I tell my girlfriend I'm quitting, and she cheers me on and supports me. Or I tell my friends that I'm quitting, hoping that if they see me succeed maybe they'll have faith that they can too.  
Then I smoke again. Sometimes I try to hide it for a while. I brush my teeth or chew gum to mask the smell. I make excuses to get away for a few minutes to get my fix. I try to distort reality so they won't know the truth. Eventually they find out or I give up pretending.  
Every time it reinforces the belief that I'm not in control, that I can't trust myself. That I am limiting my potential and have no one to blame but myself. That I may never escape the cycle and be who I want to be.  
For me, smoking gradually erodes my confidence and faith in myself, and to me that's the worst thing I can imagine happening. Worse than destroying my body, worse than sabotaging my attractiveness and social status, worse than wasting my money and time, worse than any other effect. It makes me less of a man and goes against all of my values, and those are the things that give my life real value and purpose.  
So yes, smoking will impact your quality of life. Don't ever start.",,False,,t5_2rbuf,False,,under1,True,t3_17wjcs,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/17wjcs/why_i_hate_smoking_written_while_i_was_still/,

If not for the surge of motivation I find in this subreddit I don't know how I would have been able to do this, let alone maintain a cool and level head. 

To anyone who thinks a 'bad day' warrants a quick smoke, you're better than that. You're strong. You're amazing. You don't need that smoke, you need to focus on what you can do to make yourself the best you possible.

God dammit, thank you.

When I first visited this /r/, I was two weeks away from actually quitting.  The first attempt was downright awful -- I went two days, and that second day I bought a pack of those crazy smooth Camels.  I'll tell you what, there's not a day that has passed that I haven't had an instance of pure desire for those little paper tubes, but I'll state now: they are really not worth it.  I realize this now. 

A lot of my good friends, smoker and non-smoker alike, have asked me how I feel since I flicked that last little yellow butt into the street and never looked back.  This is something that is completely strange to *really* think about.  I will say that my understanding of my addiction has been the most profound change that has taken place over the last 80 days.  I'm a junkie, plain and simple.  My brain, even now, still tells me that I need to have those little smoke sticks to live.  All this, while simultaneously telling me that I hate the leaf-tube-fire with all my might and I want nothing to do with them.  I'm calmer, and more honest since quitting.  I find that I am more cognizant of my own words, and I am constantly trying to be more honest than I have ever been in my life.  I don't run outside and crave to bury my head in a box of cancer. The rationalization was always that at least I had control of something in my life (think about that for a sec [seriously though -- I was foolish enough to believe that me having control over death was somehow relevant enough to keep smoking]).  I know many of us smoke(ed) for different reasons, but mine was definitely, by the end, a control issue.  Stopping smoking has taught me how much of a control freak I am, and has also taught me to be aware of this and try harder to relax and live in the moment more.  I would say that stopping smoking has made me a better person.  I'm not saying that I was a bad person before, or that anyone who smokes is necessarily a bad person, but for me specifically, it helped and is continuing to help make me a better person.

Of course physically, my face is brighter, and my skin has regained color.  My mom says my eyes are brighter.  Of course, breathing is, well, amazing.  I don't feel weighed down anymore.  Do you know that feeling?  That feeling immediately after smoking your 10th cig of the day?  That one where the buzz is there, but it's not satisfying, it's just, I don't know how to put this exactly, heavy?  I hated that, but I would go back out and do it again 40mins to an hour later.  

80 days -- this subreddit has truly been an inspiration.  Anyone who is trying to stop your habit, realize that you can do it, you really really can.  It might take a little while, but remember, it's not going to kill you, it's going to let you LIVE longer.  

Thanks for everything /r/stopsmoking.  I can't wait to reach a hundred days with you, two hundred days with you, a year even!  

**tl;dr - I stopped smoking 80 days ago, my life is changed for the better, and I have this subreddit to thank.  You can also quit, and trust me, life will be better.**

I went to the doctor to get tested for a nasty insect bite from camping, and he asked me if I wanted any other tests. I remembered my dad kept telling me to get an Alpha-1 Antitrypsin test so I added it (My uncle died at 40 from the deficiency combined with smoking).
 
All my other blood test results were great, but I discovered I did have an AAT deficiency (80 mg/dL where 100 is bottom of normal). I immediately threw all my cigs away and haven't smoked since.

Yes, the math is correct, he started smoking when he was 5 years old. Now, I very much wanted to be with him for every reason *other* than his less than attractive habit of chain-smoking a couple packs a day. Especially since I watched my mother waste away her lungs every day since I can remember and, at the tender age of 45, she couldn't sleep without wheezing or having trouble breathing. 

The worst part wasn't even kissing him, or having to have smoke pointedly blown away from my face to have a conversation with him, or even watching the debit card transaction rack up every month from buying carton after carton. The worst part was knowing that, while he didn't have any immediate signs of decreased lung function or health problems related to smoking, it was inevitable that I would have to watch him deteriorate in front of me just as I've watched my mother. While I did grow to love my husband very much over the first year of our relationship, this realization slowly began to gnaw at me. I didn't want to be *that girl* that gave him an ultimatum: choose me or the cigarettes. 

So I went to him like an adult and told him that I wasn't sure I could handle it, that I loved him but that I couldn't watch him kill himself slowly. To my surprise, he told me he had wanted to quit for years and didn't have the strength or motivation. It took him two years of patches, gum, petty arguments, getting down to that *last* cigarette per day, then back-peddling back up to five per day, to a pack per day, then back down to one. For some reason, he just couldn't let that last cigarette go. Finally, he was able to do it. I'm not sure what clicked for him exactly. Maybe he realized that his 'last form of stress relief' was stressing him out more than helping him.

It's been three and a half years now since his last cigarette. I believe there was once a time he slipped and had one, but got right back on the horse. My husband is a lucky man, in that he never got a cough afterwards, nor pain in his chest, nor any other symptoms those that quit seem to exhibit. I can't tell you how much money we've saved and how happy it's made me to have someone beside me that doesn't have to leave the room literally every 5 minutes to go smoke. We can go on trips now and I don't have to deal with a cranky man who is fiending for a smoke but can't have one for another hour since we're on a plane. There are so many positive changes in our life just from the stronger half of us letting go. I am so proud of him and, while I don't know what it's like to stop smoking, I have lost over 100 lbs and have had to deal with a food addiction. It is no small feat and takes incredible willpower and strength.

I am no longer physically addicted to nicotine, and the desire to smoke is mostly out of my system. I do still have difficult days, and I often have to think myself out of a craving, but I think my behavior is starting to return to normal.  Which is why I wanted to get this down - the things I take for granted when I'm feeling ""normal"".  It's so easy to forget just how bad it feels to be a smoker when you aren't one.  There comes a point where you don't just wake up and say ""Wow, I feel... just regular! How great is that?""  So before I forget, I would like to take a minute to write out the things that seem normal when you're a smoker that I do not miss at all.  I think it will help me to look back over in the coming months if I feel that urge, and hopefully it could help some of you folks just getting started.  Feel free to add on if I've missed anything!

Smoking Shit List:

-Waking up and being painfully aware of my esophagus.

-The nagging concern that wherever I go I need to have a backup plan in case I run out of cigarettes.

-Every especially good bout of laughter ending up in a fit of coughing.

-Freaking people out with a very subtle rattling wheeze every time I take a deep breath.

-The smell of my fingers when I'm trying to go to sleep.

-One less trip I have to take back into the house when I'm trying to leave because I forgot cigarettes or a lighter (now it's just the trinity of keys, wallet, why did I come in here?... oh yeah).

-Hangovers are 80% more manageable now - it turns out that so much of the recipe for a crippling hangover is chainsmoking.  It's been amazing waking up and not regretting the sandpapery act of wrenching my eyelids open after a long night of drinking.

-Getting disproportionately angry with anyone or anything that conspired to prolong the time before my smoke break.

-Randomly having half of my hand go numb.

-Coughing so hard I give myself a headache or see spots.


Most of all, I am glad to be rid of that constant fear that I will have to quit someday looming on the horizon, picturing how awful it's going to be (it wasn't) and how empty my life will be without smoking (it isn't).  Thinking every time I smoked about how I would have to quit, and then a half hour later thinking I'd never be able to make it.

Struggling.,RefrainsFromPartakin,55,5,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1ewobv/fuck_can_someone_just_talk_to_me_struggling/,"I've been trying to quit since two Sundays ago (Mother's Day). I smoked half a cigarette that morning (split the last one in the house with my friend), and bought an electronic cigarette. I was a 5-7 cigarette a day smoker (during the week), but I'd have closer to half a pack on the weekends, or a pack or two a day depending on what substance I was using. 

I went 6 days without a cigarette. I could smell again. I could smell how awful smokers smelled. I wanted cigarettes, but I didn't give in. Saturday, before work, my e-cig battery died. My buddy, who I hadn't seen in six months, picked me up from work. He was a smoker, and I was craving. I ended up having three that day, before I got my e-cig charged, and got back on that. 

Sunday night, my cartomizer stopped working. My battery is fine, as far as I can tell, but I haven't had it since then. 

I had a pack of Black clove cigars, and I've been having 1 - 1.5 of those each day. I don't feel like I NEED them, but I just want them. I just smoked one. 

I can't get to the smoke shop to replace my cartomizer until Friday, after community service, where I'd chainsmoke like a champ (Fridays I'd generally go through a pack a day), because it was one of the only ways that I could get a break from the drudgery.

I'm fighting the urge to buy a pack, partly because I know its not worth it,  but at the same time it just feels so worth it.

I miss fucking cigarettes, and I'm having trouble convincing myself that this one pack is going to ruin me. I think part of the problem is that I didn't actually WANT to quit - I quit because I knew that it was the right thing. I just...fuck I don't know, it was just so easy to quit with the e-cig, and I know that I can do it again once I fix it. I feel like I already have my mind made up, and at the same time I know I don't because I'm spending the time to type this out.

You can see from my past post it was not easy for me in the beginning.  I had lots of rough days.  But I’m pleased to say those are behind me.  Here are a few things I learned about me.  If they can help you quit, awesomesauce.  

-It really is all in your mind.  Sure you’re going to be told you need “replacement” products, but you don’t.  I smoked a pack and half a day for 17 years.  That’s as much a smoker as any of you I’d wager, and I woke up one morning and decided enough was enough.  They key part in all this is I made up my mind.  I still have my pack from one year ago in my shop, on a shelf where I can look at them.  I think there are 19 left.  Prolly taste like shit now…

-I live in KY-USA, where smokes are cheaper than just about anywhere else (bout $4.00 a pack when I quit/and $1.75 when I started), and I’ve saved close to $2,300.00 this year.  How bout that shit?  I spent every last dime on shit I wanted.  Understand, not things I needed, things I wanted.  And I did it all early in the year.  This was my way of spending all my cig money on something else.  Even if I wanted to buy smokes, the money was ready spent.  And now I have a new kick ass TV and tools.  Not cotton butts and ashes. 

-Once I did quit, I didn’t chance anything about my life, and that’s why I had such a hard time in the beginning.  Now, I’m eating better, and working out.  I feel 100000% better, and you really don’t want to smoke when you’re in that lifestyle. 

Overall I’m in a better place now, it’s all progress, ya know?  Take it a day at a time; just know that once you make your mind up, you’ve already won.  The only thing left is to go through the motions.

I was 36 and had been smoking a pack a day (probably more) for 20 years. There is not a photograph taken of me in the outdoors during those 20 years that didn't show a cigarette in my hand. I loved smoking. It defined my waking day from dawn til bedtime. I spent more than $40,000 by my calculations and did who knows what kind of lasting and irreparable damage to my health. And then it was time to quit again and for keeps. I had to make every effort to regain health and fitness before I turned 40 and had to contend with the ills of aging as well as smoking. I don't have the health insurance to cover all that. 

It was hell. It was the hardest quit I had ever done because I was never going back. The process was life consuming and terrifying. When would I stop wanting to smoke? What do I do with my free time? How do I avoid my friends and family who still smoke? Will I ever be able to get my party on without being tempted? But r/stopsmoking was there with your stories of success and failure. You shared your tips and pitfalls and fears and pride. I quit smoking by myself but you were there to offer community during lonely and scary times. 

What worked. Substitution. During the first two days I chewed the gum. When I realized that I was for real, I dumped the gum and turned to what I had replaced with smoking all these years...food. I ate everything. I went from 175 to 200 lbs in 12 weeks. I drank when I was thirsty instead of smoking. I realized I've been thirsty for two decades.   I replaced my constant nagging thoughts of ""do I have enough cigarettes in this pack to last me?"" with ""I am never going through this again"". And finally, I replaced my fear and self loathing with more positive change. My biggest personal flaw was moving to my past and it was time to start tackling the rest of the flaws. 

So here I am reporting in to you guys to let you know that life does go on and you will feel better. If you're my age, losing that new weight should be the first thing you tackle when you start getting your lungs back. It is more stubborn than the nicotine cravings.  I still get the occasional craving but it is ephemeral and disassociated from any real desire to smoke. I go weeks now without thinking about smoking except to reflect on how I never would have run that 5k or gone to the gym 3 times a week or taken that bike ride with my kids or taken that perfectly formed and regularly timed dump this morning. More than anything, I have gained time. I have no disillusion that I will live longer now. I figure 20 pack years is enough to have sown the seeds of my destruction. The time I have is in the everyday. I work better and faster. I play more. I sleep better. I spend more time with people without having to excuse myself. 

Thank you for your help. If you are here and you want to quit, you will. Just teach yourself the following mantra and you will succeed.  ""Anything is better than smoking"". If you have already quit and are tempted or are cheating, just remember how fucking hard it was to quit in the first place and really ask yourself if you ever want to feel that way again.

To treat myself, I decided to invest the money I saved (along with a large sum from my standard savings) in a motorbike. 

The first thing I did once I booked my test was to (I know, I know), research the crash/death rate for motorbikes. Turns out the chances of a fatal accident occurring is 0.001%, yet...this still scared the shit out of me. What if I was that 0.001%?!

Then, something came to mind. 

What was the chances of dying from smoking? If you're over 30, it's a damn sight more than 0.001%, it's in the range of 30-33% of dying before your 80th birthday from smoking related diseases. 

So how, I wondered, did the tiniest percentage that I could crash my motorbike scare me MORE than a 30% chance of dying from an easily preventable cause?

Fuck you brain. Convincing myself that smoking wouldn't kill me due to the amount of time between activity and reaction was the reason I never stopped until last month. 

I'm glad that's behind me now, remember, don't let your brain fool you into justifying smoking, there's a pretty high chance you'll die from it.

There are hundreds of cool ways to die, COPD/lung cancer ain't one of them. 

If you don't hear back from me, then I'm probably in the 0.001%, but skidding off a cliff into a deep ravine sounds WAY cooler than lying in a hospital bed for years, full of tubes and struggling for breath.

Stay safe out there, hope this wasn't too wordy and insane.

And you know what? I can smell now. I can smell *myself* now especially. I'm much more sensitive to the scent of my body and of my clothes, and I have to say I'm not impressed. :( Will have to work on.

Another big thing is that I live with my brother and *he* still smokes and has no desire to quit. He's been very considerate, but when he comes back inside the house I'm realizing just how much we used to stink up the house!! I could never smell it before, not like this!

I'm much more sensitive to the smell of smoke now, too, and I don't know whether it's the effects of the Chantix but I was walking back to the bus stop downtown the other night, **passed some smokers, and when I caught a whiff I was initially like ""ungng"" followed quickly by a splitting headache.

It's driving me nuts and I wonder when it will end. 

I persist because despite my love of smoking, it's not something I wish to continue. But damn, it's psychological warfare in my head right now.

Edit:  It's nice to hear others are struggling like I am. I was starting to think I was alone in my battle as opposed to being super duper psyched and excited about quitting as most posters seem to be.

I wanted to post right on the three year mark, but plain old forgot. Anyway, I thought it might be nice to share my story and let everyone trying to quit know that it *is* possible and that it is totally worth it.

I'm 32 years old now. I started smoking when I was 18, for the stupidest of reasons. I accidentally stumbled across some co-workers stealing a case of cartons of cigarettes. They gave me a carton to keep me quiet. I wouldn't have said anything but they didn't know that. I didn't smoke at the time, so I'd just bring a pack to parties to give away and/or sell. One day someone called me on it. ""Why do you always have cigarettes? I've never seen you smoke ever!""

So I had a cigarette. And then another later in the evening. I had one walking home from work the next day too. Pretty soon the carton was gone and I was buying packs. I'm sure you all know how this goes. My average intake stabilized somewhere in the pack a day region. It became a normal part of my life.

Seven years passed. I was 25, just finishing school as a recording engineer, and starting out in the film industry doing location sound. In order to wire people up with lavalier mics you have to get right into their personal space (you're running wires under their clothes). One of my instructors suggested that my career would take off faster if I quit smoking. I went on the patch, and managed to quit. It was great! I started riding bikes again and everything!

Almost a year later I was dating a girl who happened to smoke. It never bothered me, as I was already completely used to the smell of cigarettes. I was working at a bar, and one night after my shift she asked me to pick up a pack for her before taking the bus out to her place. No problem. Until I was waiting for the bus. There were five other people waiting. They were all smoking. I cracked. It had been 10 months, surely I could have just one. Hah. Yeah right.

I was back to a pack a day inside of a week. That carried on until one day I felt a persistent tickle in my throat. It got worse over the course of a few days. I started coughing. Not just the usual smokers hack. It got to the point that no amount of lozenges or cough syrup would quell it. On September 4th, 2009 I was coughing so much that I couldn't fall asleep. I was up until 5AM the following day coughing. So I did it. I took the remains of the pack of smokes I had, ran them under the tap, threw them out, and haven't touched one since.

It took more than a grandfather, grandmother, and uncle dying of lung cancer and/or heart disease caused by cigarettes to scare me off smoking. It took real personal fear for my own safety. I knew the whole time I smoked that it was stupid. At least half the time when I lit up I hated it. Now I just fear it. It took the realization that I can never touch another cigarette again in my entire life in order to stop.

I kept riding bikes even through my relapse. But now I ride for real. I can bang off 100 miles of riding like a boss. I travel by bicycle. I ride up freakin' mountains. I love it. I hope you succeed and find something that you love as well!

But for the last month or so, I've been smoking 10 cigarettes a day. 
Why? I have no idea.

I seriously want to quit forever. I hate that disgusting smell. I hate not being able to hug my mom because I'm hiding the fact I'm smoking from her. I hate everything about cigarettes.

All my life, I've wondered: Why DO smokers smoke?
Obviously, I've decided to find out for myself.

Imagine my dissapointment when I found out that cigarettes give you absolutely nothing positive. Nothing. Zinch. Nada.
Imagine me asking myself: How can one find this pleasurable?
Yet I continued to smoke. Why? I don't know. No smoker does.

Today I bought a pack...smoked one. I never got so mad in my life. I threw away the pack, the lighter and my ashtray. 

I honestly think my peers don't really know what cigarettes are. A lot of them aren't aware what is actually going on and why do they need to smoke. I swear this one girl never knew what nicotine was, yet she was a smoker. 

Me? I can't smoke anymore...I feel like an idiot when smoking. Every time I lit up a cigarette in this last month, I had this line go through my head, but still I smoked:

""We are presenting you with a new drug. Millions of people around the world use it. What are the side effects? It makes you anxious, it makes you smell bad, it kills you slowly, it makes you severely addicted to it, it has rat poison, azbestos and all kinds of other poisons in it.

Oh, you want to know why people still use it? The positive side of the drug?

Nothing. This drug will do absolutely nothing for you. It won't even get you high.
Ladies and gentleman, this here is a cigarette.""

I'm 17 and I finally understand what cigarettes are and why people smoke them. Why? Nicotine addiction.
I can understand people abusing weed, alcohol, hard drugs such as heroin, cocaine etc.
Those drugs actually do something for you. Sure, they have a negative side. But they have a great positive side to them as well.

But cigarettes? No, thanks.

Now I understand why adults tell their children to never smoke. But unfortunately, curiousity kills the cat, and everyone has to find out the hard way.
Rare are those that resist the temptation of curiousity.

Fuck nicotine. Fuck cigarettes. They are the definition of evil.

Pure evil.

Then, I started to notice small things. Like, rain during a sunny day smells one way - completely different from rain on a cloudy day. Bright warm days smell different from cool days. I suppose it came back gradually, just like it left. I feel a bit childish because whenever I go out I remark to anyone I'm with what the day smells like. Wooded areas smell amazing. Streams too. Smokers smell awful. (I didn't realize this.) Meat has a smell. Apparently, my shave soap has a smell. My girlfriend's hair is my favorite though.

You just have to remember that those things are called your life, and they are not going anywhere. You just gotta power through it!
2) I found it helpful to stop telling myself after x amount of weeks that I had won. Like ""oh, it's been 2 months, I'm a non smoker now!"" Nope, somehow that thought always screwed me over. I've accepted that some part of me will always be a smoker, its a never ending battle to not steal a drag off somebody or buy a pack when I'm drunk, but it gets easier and easier as time goes on!
3) It helps to stay off the hooch for awhile for the first couple months, but I used to always try to kick all my vices all at once, like no cigs, booze, soda, junk food.... I found it helpful this time just to focus on the cigarettes and let the other things come naturally with my new healthier lifestyle. So for example, after a few months I discovered I could breath, so I gave rock climbing a shot, got super into it, and other good habbits just fell in line.

In fact, I will be taking close to a two hour ride in the same car with them. Usually, the thought of any of this would've made me sweat. 

Two hours in a car with no smokes? When will I be able to sneak off for one? What if his family can smell the smoke on me? I just know they'll be judging me.

I cannot even BEGIN to tell you how immensely happy it made me when I realized, ""Hey! Wait, you don't smoke anymore! You don't have to be the odd one out. You don't have to stress about any of that.""

Just knowing if I did have just one smoke I'd have to work through that whole, horrible, emotional ordeal again, was motivation enough to not touch one. 

I've drank several times since then and been around smokers countless times. I can 100% say I am a non-smoker now. The smell of smoke is no longer comforting to me.

",BridgetteBane,55,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pwfqm/almost_to_a_full_year_wanted_to_stop_back_in/,"**TL;DR:** Stop smoking, start being awesome. This is a long, semi-rambling representation of how I quit smoking. 

I quit almost completely cold turkey last April, and I'm doing great. My first three days involved a lot of trolling myself (by believing I actually needed to smoke) and even smoking while on the patch, which is pretty freaking dangerous. The fourth day is when my copy of ""The Easy Way"" arrived. I read it all in one day, and haven't smoked since.  Here's an honest portrayal of life, post-nicotine. 

The first weeks were moderately ok. I had to take a lot of deep breaths, there was an embarrassing breakdown at work one day. I won't sugarcoat how surprised I was to realize what a shield those cigarettes were for me. A shitty table pissing me off? It's ok, I can handle it as long as I can smoke in 15 minutes... A cook screwed up my order? It's cool, I get to smoke in 10 minutes... Every thing was made better by ignoring it and wishing for a cigarette. Without them, I had to really confront what I was feeling and admit that my emotional control pretty much stopped growing the day I started smoking. So on day 8, everything just stacked up and I just started crying. Told my customers it was because I got a red pepper flake in my eye, everyone chilled out after that point.  Overall, the first weeks were good because I was so excited that I was *actually living life without nicotine*. I loved calculating how many cigs I hadn't smoked, how much money I had saved. I loved most being able to come here to /stopsmoking and share my successes with others. 

The second month was where it became bloody hard to stay off them. I had injured my back and been put on steroids to help. If you don't know, steroids make it pretty easy to gain weight. So does quitting smoking. I gained like 10 pounds that month, while also in a bit of a life-decision sort of ordeal. My boyfriend had lost his grad assistanship funding in a huge budget cutback. Do we move back home to the east coast, or stay out west? Where do we move? What jobs can we find? Oh fuck, my parents just announced they're selling the house and moving away from my hometown. Do I want to go back to school? A billion questions, no easy answers.  I was having panic attacks about four times a week. 

It was about the third month when something really strange, so totally fucking weird, happened. 

I started to really live my life.  I would take walks in the morning, just me and the outdoors, contemplating my emotions and thoughts, getting my mental shit together, and overall just enjoying the hell out of it. Observing the world around me, the feel of my feet on the pavement, how nice the sun felt; it just made me feel a thousand times better.  I started really concentrating on gardening on my little balcony, and learning how to care for something other than basil and oregano, which are pretty much zero effort. I got a mini rose, and that thing is fickle. I loved getting to see how it would grow and develop, and the first bloom that opened gave me a total sense of accomplishment. I started quilting, and getting to play with all those little pieces of fabric and getting them lined up juust right was a challenge and a pleasure both. I started reading more books about business and careers and such, and less of the ones that I read for escapism.

That's what cigarettes were, I realized. They were an escape from everything I didn't want to face. When I smoked, a day off would consist of reading books and watching tv, my ass glued to the couch and a cigarette probably every 20 minutes.  When I would go out with friends, it was all about the conversations we could have between cigarettes, and most of our conversations were about how bad it sucked being a smoker in a smoking-banned world. Now I can enjoy learning more about my friends, and doing things like going bowling and to movies and such. 

Around November, life got really hard. I'd been staying at my parents' house to do maintenance and such while the house was for sale. My dad told me, they finally accepted a deal and we have 30 days to finish emptying it out, cleaning it up, and all that. I had to move again, my gig as a Halloween store manager was over, so I had to get a new job, and a billion more questions had popped up with difficult answers. It was like my month 2, but so much worse. But I did it entirely without cigarettes. My emotions were things I acknowledged and managed, instead of escaped and panicked over. I am the master of my life now, not some asshole named Phillip Morris. 

Without cigarettes chaining me to a sedentary life, it's fucking awesome. I go to the gym when I feel like it. I have my mini garden, and finally have the backyard I need to put in a big one. I am ambitions about things. I go to Polar Bear Plunges (but chicken out), I volunteer sometimes. I have a clean house, and I like it much better. Smoking tried to convince me that it was the immediate pleasure to enjoy in life, not the pleasure of the results of effort. You enjoy a cigarette while you have it, but when it's over, that's sad and you just want another. I've evolved, and now realize that the results are the important part. Sure, I hate doing dishes, but I love seeing a nice clean kitchen afterwards. I may not like going to the gym, but I enjoy how my muscles ache and the endorphin rush after. My job is stressful, but I understand that it's just a rocky spot and once I barrel through, everything will be fine. 

Sometimes I look around at parties when my friends are smoking. I look at those cigarettes and say ""Yea, I could have one of those. But I'm not, cause I am so much more amazing without them."" Having a cig at this point would be admitting I can't handle my life. And I now for a fact that I can. 

The hardest part about quitting smoking is overcoming the lies your addiction tells you. Once you realize that you can live life without a cigarette controlling you, you're going to kick yourself for believing those lies for so long. I'd wish you ""good luck"", my quitting friends, but the truth is you don't need luck. You just need to know you can do it.

After a trip to the E.R. and a couple visits to my doctor, I think we finally got me set straight. Here is what happened:

* I have ADHD
* The nicotine kind of kept the ADHD suppressed and when I quit smoking the ADHD came full bloom
*  My blood pressure jumped in line with the attacks and sent my blood pressure to about 200/110
*  Yesterday I finally got my doctor to put me on blood pressure meds and I feel better than I have in over a month.  

The lesson here is that you should NOT feel like shit 2 months after you quit.  If you are not feeling better after about 2 weeks off the junk then there may be other problems so get to a doctor--it could save your life.

I don't stink.  (well, I still smell like ass, but I don't smell like smoked ass)

2.) I didn't think I'd have enough money for food to last me until payday (today)....somehow another $30 ended up in my wallet somehow.  Que curioso.

3.) Things taste better/worse.  I had to cut back how much hotsauce I put on things, it's way sharper.  
That said, my aunt's creamed onions on Thanksgiving were even grosser this year than I remember.  

4.) I can breath in the morning.  I don't wake up each day wheezing.  I can run for more than 50 feet too.

5.) I don't have to wash my hands with detergent before going to bed anymore.  I couldn't stand that 
smell of ash on my hands because I sleep with my hand like right under my head.  I would scrub and scrub and scrub and scrub to get that smell gone before bed. Not anymore.

6.) I'm not worried about accidentally starting fires

7.) When people ask me for a cigarette I look at them and say ""I can't help you"" and I don't feel like a liar.

8.) More room in my pockets for other things.

I have stopped Smokeing Today, wish me luck",HopefullySmokefree,55,11,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1iv04a/my_first_post_on_reddit_ever_i_have_stopped/,"After about 2 years of lurking i created my first Reddit Account today. I decided to make my first post in this subreddit. 

About my smokeing history:

I am 24 years old.
I was a non smoker until i hit the age of about 18-20. Lots of things started to change in my life back then.I Just finished school, Parents divorced, and a very big stroke of fate happened in which my brother nearly died (he got into a fight and got stabbed very badly, where the assaulter also hit his heart. But luckily he survived and recoverd nearly 100% and got no braindamage or something). Around that time my mother started smokeing again (she had stopped smokeing before the birth of me and my siblings). 



So with the cigarettes laying in the house all the time i started smokeing too. It increased to nearly a package (Malboro gold) over the last two years. for about half a year now i started to stop smokeing but havent really made it for a long time yet. I often throw away nearly full packages after which i find myself buying a new one 6 hours later. My record for now is about one week of being smoke free but after that i started again. So today i decided to become a real non-smoker and to not smoke any cigarette no matter what.
Wish me luck.

So now a couple of questions i hope you guys could answer for me. 

1. My mother is still smokeing and she gets very aggressive/definsive when i tell her to stop or atleast to not do it in the house. When i get her to throw her cigarettes away or when after long talks she promises me to not do it in the house atleast, i ofter find her smokeing after a couple of days in the house anyways etc. How can i deal with that (moving out is currently no real option since i am financially dependent on her).

2. How can i politely deal with smokeing friends who offer you cigarettes etc and who smoke indoors when non-smokers are present?

3. Are there any tips on how to deal with withdrawal and what to do when i catch my self smokeing again?

4. Since i have smoked very heavily for about 4-5 years im sure my body took a lot of damage. Are there any ""bodily signs"" which i should keep an eye on, that could be dangerous (smokeing related diseases). Also since i have a higher risk for cancer now, is there any sort of ""checkup"" which my physician could do on me?

I appreciate all the advice you guys could give a new non-smoker, related to my questions or not. So thanks in advance for every comment or advice i get from you.
Cheers

tl;dr:
Stopped smokeing, need every advice on:                              
How to keep it that way 
How to deal with smokers 
Smokeing related diseases and how to treat them (escpecially the deadly ones ;)  )

Because after all, I am still am a nicotine-addict and will be for life.
I apologise for being a horrible writer but even if I could support one person during the process of quitting smoking with this rant, I feel somewhat obligated to at least try to describe some of my experiences.
Especialy nowadays, when smokers are considered to be anti-social and are being treated as such. It's rediculous. I can proudly say that I've reached the point in my life I can hang out with smokers,
even in the designated smoking areas, without being tempted. I like people wether they smoke or not. :)

I started smoking at about the age of 16. Not that I was pushed into doing it by peer pressure or something like that, no. In all fairness, I was the asshole who instigated smoking amoungst my friends
and it's something I still regret to this day. We started doing it out of sheer boredom. Because it was fun and kind of rebellious. Little did we know the consequences.
As most of you, I started with a couple of cigarets a day. Harmless as it sounds, I don't even remember when I got hooked. 
After 10 years of heavily smoking (about 2 packs a day) I wanted to quit. Not that I was sick or had health issues. I could afford it and it was more or less socially accepted by friends, collegues and family.
Even after I went out for a smoke, came back (probably smelling horrible), I never got real negative remarks.
However, I believe that people who have never been smoking just don't know about certain things. As a smoker, you shouldn't even get upset with them. They just don't understand what it's like to be addicted.
They don't know how well it feels to have that smoke after dinner. How it feels to get that first hit from a cigaret you 've been waiting for for way to long, that release of stress.
They don't know the panic you get when you see you're running out of cigarettes. The frustration when you forgot your lighter. They don't understand why you'ld stand outside in the rain for that one
smoke you were craving for the whole night. They don't understand how even going to a movie can be shitty because you can't go outside for a smoke. That countdown.
The FUUUUUUUUUUUuuuu-moments when your cigarette-package got wet because of the rain, flattened or your last two cigarettes broken in half. Believe me, I understand.

That's probably why it bothers me there's so much hate towards smokers. This sense of moral higher grounds from non-smokers who have absolutely NO IDEA of what they're talking about.
I personally didn't get put off by the warning labels on the packages. It could've even been illegal. I needed my shot. It's funny how non-smokers keep using arguments like ""Think of all the money you could save if you quit"".
As if the price of sigarettes has anything to do with the addiction. It's NEVER a reason to quit. Would they say the same to a heroin-addict? ""Think of all the money you'll save""...

For me personally, and I believe many others, the biggest drawback about quitting smoking is the idea you will always miss out on something.
Your life would never be as fullfilling as with cigarettes. The constant missing out on something.
The irrational thought you will never be as happy as when you are smoking. The thought of missing out on a cigarette would ruin your life. Yes, it's irrational but I understand that that doesn't make it any less real.
But trust me. As much as a non-smokers can't understand the need to smoke, that much you can't grasp the concept of not needing a sigaret.

So how did I quit?
At new years eve of 2009-2010, I had a new years-resolution. I told my family I would quit smoking. When they asked when I would, I jokingly said late december 2011.:)
On my birthday in may 2011 I remembered telling I'ld quit that year but didn't care to much about it. A few days later I thought: ""What if I acutally kept my word and quit?. No substitutes, no cheating, just quit.""
I literally went to a calender and pointed out somewhere on it blindly. I closed my eyes and ""randomly"" picked somewhere (near the end of course :)) of december when I would quit smoking. It turned out to be december 17th.
As days went on, I felt more and more the pressure of that day approaching. Also, I told all of my friends and collegues I'ld quit that day. From time to time is was even counting out loud the days I had left as a smoker...

Suddenly, a wild december the 16th appears... 
My mindset at that time was completely focused on the fact that an era of my life was about to finish.
I had 1,5 package left and smoked like crazy that day. I will never forget that last sigaret I smoked a minute before midnight.
I remembered thinking: ""This is the best sigaret I'll ever smoke, because it's going to be my last one"". I went outside, smoked it but the remaining package in my back pocket and went to bed immediatly.
The first day was horrible ... so was the second ... and the third ... If there's anything SOMEONE SHOULD've told me about quitting, it should've been the fact that about the first 100 days are equally horrible.
Torture. With ups and downs of course but for me there was absolutley NO improvement the first three months. 
The drawbacks were incredible. My throat didn't feel as much better as I thought it would. I got sick easily and the worst
was probably being constipated. Sounds funny? Let me tell you it's not. You probably know what I'm talking about when I say smoking is kind of a ... katalysator for taking a shit.You know, *that moment when you get a break and have to choose between taking a crap and a cigarette. The cigarette always wins.
Then it need for a shit gets even worse.* That process was gone now.
All the oranges in the world couldn't help my intestines at that time. My digestive system was completely out of balance.
And in the past 2.5 years of not smoking I gained 26 kilos (57 pounds) because I compensated my urges by eating. I'm a smoke-free fatty now.

In those first three months, it's incredible how your mind tries to play tricks on yourself. Trying to justify, finding the reason that one sigaret would release you from all the stress. Agony.
It sounds dramatic but I can only describe it as being taken hostage and being tortured, every day and every minute of the day. You are no longer in control of your urges. Everything becomes about smoking.
At work, at home, in the bar. It's all you think of... every ... single ... second.
I can honestly say, quitting smoking has been the most diffcult experience in my life. Not that this sounds encouraging but I'm not going to lie to you. It's been a nightmare. I even cried a few times. Waking up in the middle of
the night for that crave, not being able to sleep. Hell.

Then something amazing happened. At some point I realised that a day went by without thinking of a cigarette. As unimaginable as it sounds, it happened. As a smoker you can't grasp this concept but it's awesome as it happens.
I would have never thought of succeeding if you'ld asked me this 5 years ago. No way. I'm not really kind of person who follows through on things. I give up rather easily and get bored real quick.
Willpower isn't my best quality so this is why I'm pretty much convinced anyone can quit smoking. I don't see it as having willpower. It's more about how much (mental and physical) pain you can bare.
Even though there is only a small difference between the two.

I don't want to put anybody off, the contrary, but I don't think I'ld be able to do it again. That's probably the biggest reason for me to never give in to temptation again.
Was it worth the trouble? ABSOLUTELY!
Do I sometimes still feel like having a cigarette? ABSOLUTELY!
Probably once a month, and it lasts for about 10 seconds and then that feeling is GONE. Completely.
Wouldn't you sign for that?

Based on my experience, this is the advice I would give to you if you want to stop smoking.
I'm not saying this will be suitable for anyone, but this is more or less how I did it:
 
- Pick a date (even a year from now if you want) when you're going to quit. You will look forwards to this day. STICK TO THIS DATE. There is no such thing as being ready for it. You never are, so get on with it.
- Tell people you are going to quit. It sounds weird but that social pressure was sometimes what kept me going.
- Cheating is bad mmmmkay. Don't take substitutes like nicotine gum/electric sigarets, that's cheating. These maintain and support the addiction. You don't negotiate with terrorists...
- Do not avoid social gatherings, clubs/bars! I agree it's the biggest test but you will feel proud everytime leaving without having smoked. In fact, it's great stuff for conversation which has a therapeutic value I guess.
- Do not throw away your cigarettes at least the first month. Keep them where you usually would. The comfort of actually having them with me was an immense help! I had no extra stress of needing to find one if I actually decided to give up.
  It might sound contradictive, but the fact that I COULD relaps any moment supported the fact that I SHOULDN'T.
- Congratulate yourself. Every minute, every second without nicotine is an achievement!
- It might sound silly. But if you think of giving up, say it to yourself OUT LOUD. ""I give up!"". I remember going to the night shop on two different occasions and actually buying a package but not having the heart to start again after I said it out loud. Talking to yourself out loud is less insane than inhaling fumes.
- There is no shame in feeling weak! Don't feel guilty about it. It's a huge part of the process.
- A great motivator for me was actually imagining what would happen if I relapsed. Imagining that first hit. Feeling incredible for a second... shortly followed by shame. Embrace that thought of shame.
- Know that deep down, EVERY smoker wants to quit. It's part of the addiction. Those who say they don't, are lying. I know this is a bold statement but it's true. How many times you haven't you lied about this, especially to yourself?

You CAN do this.

I've read/added to it whenever I have a bad craving, and I posted it here in r/stopsmoking in the hope it would be helpful to others. I just made it to three months and the list has nearly doubled in size. 

If you've already read the [original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/ucr3r/why_its_worth_it/) you can skip to the linebreak to see what's new. Suggestions are welcome--why is it worth it for *you?*

* No going out into nasty weather for a smoke 

* Better focus/patience in long classes

* No cigarette burns on flesh/fabric

* No accidentally lighting the filter

* I no longer worry about skyrocketing cigarette prices

* Smaller ecological footprint!

* One less social stigma to deal with

* One less source of guilt

* No more weird yellow stains on windshield

* Less nausea/better appetite

* Because FUCK CIGARETTES, that’s why!!!!!

* Breaks at work/school are actual breaks, not a timed sprint to the parking lot

* I’m generally more active

* I process stress better

* Watching other people smoke isn’t so bad anymore

* I feel like I’m slowly turning into a completely different person, and I like and respect her more every day she doesn't smoke.

Sorry for the wall of text!

1) I still get little tinges of cravings, especially when I'm stressed out. I find I talk more about my feelings, which was very difficult before I quit. I also find that I address issues at the appropriate time. I handle stressful situations better now rather than keeping it all pent up inside, stewing it over with a cigarette. People understand when you're acting stressed *in a stressful situation* -- it's a normal reaction.

2) I have switched my food munching with jogging. I initially replaced smoking with food, but that's all turned around. I'm going to try and run a 5K this winter. I'm well on my way to becoming healthier in a well-rounded way. I don't gasp for air when I run!

3) After nine years of smoking cigarettes, actually quitting and staying quit have been incredibly empowering. **I now want to try.** Before I quit smoking, I said things like, ""I'd like to do that someday."" Now I make plans to actually do it and know that when I put my mind and willpower to something, I actually come through.

4) I can go into bars that allow smoking and realize how much I *do not want* to smoke. It doesn't trigger me at all. It smells awful. I don't ever want to smell like that ever again. I always have to immediately come home and throw clothes in the washer. I never thought I'd get to this point.

5) This summer hasn't been that hot for me, even though it's been crazy hot and humid outside -- because I've only had to go outside to get into my car! I enjoy outdoor activities, but I don't have to take outside breaks at work or in the middle of a project indoors because I have to accommodate a smoking habit. I can enjoy my air conditioning in my car and it won't get sucked out of the crack in the window!

6) I like to sing and, while I'm definitely not a professional by any means, I find myself being able to sing for longer and without wheezing.

7) I was at a dinner gathering with a bunch of friends and a smoke break occurred. An attractive acquaintance and I were left behind (in the air conditioning, too). Turns out we were both ""quitters"" and we struck up an awesome conversation! Those dating prospects I talked about four months ago? It opens wider every day with the amount of people I meet. Smoking is a no-nonsense deal breaker for a lot of people.

8) Smoking is no longer cool. I've noticed more and more of my friends setting quit dates or declaring their want to quit.

9) My nails aren't yellow anymore! Along with smoking, I was biting my nails, so I never saw how my smoking was keeping them yellow. Now that I've quit smoking AND biting my nails, I see a huge difference in my nail bed! I'm not a nervous wreck anymore.

10) I've saved over $1000 so far, been able to have an awesome summer, and I'm moving into my first apartment with no roommates. All of this has been a rippling effect from my quitting.

Bonus) **I feel healthier.** I smell better. I look better. I work better. I socialize better. I don't have to worry about me ""tasting like an ashtray"" if someone kisses me. I feel better about my future and my life.

oh jeez guys, so I'm now 24 years old and I have been smoking off and on since I was 17, pretty heavily for the last couple years. In October 2012 I kicked the habit cold turkey using alan carr and it was a bitch of a couple months, I gained weight, hated those around me, but slowly and surely I thought I was done with them forever. I started training for a marathon and didn't ever look twice at cigarettes, felt bad for smokers I saw on the street, could get totally drunk and not care.
 But theeeen, around new years I took a hit off a spliff and liked it. But still for the next couple months I didn't touch cigarettes, just now and again would smoke some spliffs casually. I knew that I enjoyed it for more than the weed, but didn't stop. Then came a trip over to Belgium to visit a friend I hadn't seen in awhile. He would always smoke my cigarettes when we were drunk and lo and behold, once we got wasted, we bought a pack. Smoked them all night and then we had some left over the next day I had a couple while sober. Got home - reset my badge - felt shame. 
Still, I thought I was still strong, still done forever with the nicotine monster. But last week, 24 days after resetting my badge AGAIN, i smoked while drunk. regretted it the next day. This all leads to today. I feel pretty down and depressed, I am in love with a boy who doesn't love me as much as I want him too, school is annoying me, and I feel fat even though I'm pretty healthy, running a lot. 
Anyways, casual day at home and all of a sudden I'm walking to a convenience store and buying a package of tobacco. Get home - light it up aaaaand turns out, CIGARETTES ARE DISGUSTING. I only smoked two puffs, put it out and now I'm writing this. I wanted that cigarette to make me feel better, sexier, confident, happy, and for some reason I felt like it would. I'm a damn fool, cigarettes don't solve anything and they honestly don't taste good. anyways, never again. i don't want the life I had back.

I figured since everyone in here is doing the right thing by quitting, I'd offer some encouragement to aid your excellent, although challenging, journey. First and foremost let me start off by saying that I am a former smoker (I think a bit over 3 years at this point) so I know the pain of quitting. I was a smoker for over 10 years so I know this is a nightmare to go through. However everything you're experiencing, although terrible I know, serves a purpose and it’s important to empower yourself with this knowledge because it will make the quitting process easier. This isn't a time-line guide by any means, because in my opinion we all go through these things but each of us experiences it at different times. This is more of a psychological guide of what to expect so when it happens you won't lose your shit and light up another smoke. 

**Part I - FML the first days are the worst!**

So you've decided to quit, good for you. Sure you have your reasons, maybe it was for your health, for a loved one, to save money, or maybe you were just sick of coughing up blood and black stuff (Yup, been there). Either way, you've made a great choice. Consciously you feel awesome, but physically you probably just took a dump in your stomach because you just realized you've committed to something that you haven't prepared yourself for....withdrawals. Here's what you should expect for the first couple days:

1. Anger - Why not? Don't you usually smoke when you're irritated? The kind of anger you feel is probably similar to a 5 year old angry at his mom because she won't buy him the toy in the store; you're angry but you know it's irrational.

2. Sickness - I know, strange huh? The body is kind of weird like that. For some reason when we try to do something healthy for the first time in a long time our body usually shows us it's appreciation by making us sick. You may get headaches, nausea, sweats, the shakes, etc. It's all normal; just drink a lot of water. 

3. Sadness/Depression - You feel like crying doesn’t you? I know. Go ahead, let it out. On my 4th day I curled up in a ball like a little bitch and just started bawling my eyes out. I was so sad accepting the fact that my ""life was over"". I couldn't say it out loud, but damnit, I knew it was! I LOVED smoking. I felt like I was never going to enjoy life to the fullest again. Good news though, life actually is better later on. But for now, go ahead and let it out.

4. Restlessness - Ok, this one sucks merely for the fact that it just makes those 3 other things more intense. If this happens to you my advice would be to do whatever healthy thing you can do to make yourself tired. Some people use music, drink warm milk, meditate, pray, go on a walk. Just figure out anything that helps you burn off the energy. 

**My Part I secret weapon? EXERCISE!!!** Seriously, this helped me so much with the restlessness and the anger. It also helps as a distraction for your sadness/depression. If you are really out of shape, which I was at the time (273lbs at 5'10""!), you can still do light exercise (i.e. crunches, walk around the block, jumping jacks, etc).

**Part II - No, the first 2 weeks are way worse!**
So, you made past the 7 day mark. Congrats. Statistically you shoulda failed by now, so be proud that you've made it this far. By now, medically a lot of good stuff has happened (I don't know all the details), but do you give a shit? Of course not! You're hating life to the fullest right now because this is the longest vacation you've taken from them since who knows how long. On the flip side, here are some things you'll probably notice during the next couple weeks:

1.	You're going to have more energy - Waking up will be easier, and you probably won't need as much caffeine to wake up

2.	You're going to smell/taste better - Kind of a double edge sword. You may gain a few pounds. But if you're working out like I recommended you won’t' notice as much but food will taste and smell AWESOME!

3.	Less frequent anger - Yeah, it's still around, but you've come to expect it at this point. You probably noticed that it lasts for usually a few minutes then you start to cool off. Start timing it that way you can predict it better and thus control it better

4.	Depression/Sadness starts to decrease - You've started to accept the fact that you're life isn't over, but it definitely is changing. You need to start developing new routines. You can't go to your normal lunch spot and hang out with smokers anymore, get away from it, they'll understand. Start distracting yourself during your downtime (Reddit was a great time killer).

**My Part II secret weapon? Replaced coffee with GATORADE**. This was huge because caffeine is a HUGE trigger for cigarette cravings. I found new places to go during my lunch breaks and other downtimes. Separated myself from other smokers. 

I'll release a Part III &amp; IV but I first want to get feedback on this guide before proceeding. Hope this helps, please feel free to add or comment on it as appropriate.

**EDIT:** Frontpage, wow! Thank you to everyone for all the wonderful feedback and support. I'm really glad you've liked this first installment and I have decided to begin work on the 2nd installment.

I've been working myself up for a few weeks now that it is time to quit. I have a cold today so smoking tastes particularly bad and hurts my throat quite a bit. I found myself outside the office building with he other smokers. I finished the cigarette and tossed the rest of the pack (and the lighter) into the garbage can.

My motivators for quitting are cost, health and the desire to be in control. I have often defined the cigarette as my friend since I often have one during quite moments. This line of thinking is utterly foolish, I am killing myself. I now picture myself in a hospital bed dying of lung cancer and being really upset with myself for not quitting.

*EDIT* 7/31/2012 

Yesterday was hell. On day two now, and it's getting easier! Had a couple cravings today, beat them with Gum, water, and a jog. As well as re-reading every comment here. Honestly, you guys rock - I hadn't expected to make such a splash. I feel like I can't let you guys down now! Thank you a thousand times over.

No regrets and no chance of going back!,madetopost1comment,49,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/t07ie/ive_been_a_nonsmoker_for_1_week_no_regrets_and_no/,"So I realize that a week is not a lifetime, but I can promise you that I'll never smoke another cigarette again. On the second day I was a little tempted and resisted, this happened again and again, but now, slowly, the cravings are decreasing. On the 1st day I thought about cigarettes maybe 30 times. Today it's down to around 5 times a day and I'm getting better at learning how to defend myself against a craving. I just thought I'd share my success, give some advice based on what I've done so far, and ask /r/stopsmoking for any additional tips.

* First, I read Carr's book. I know....it's brainwashing. Whatever. It's working for me. I really like his two rules (1. Decide to quit smoking. 2. Don't complain about quitting, be happy that you made a great decision). I know his book downplays willpower, but that's really important to me, so I added that as a 3rd step/rule/statement. I can quit smoking because I'm in control.

* I've kept a journal of my smoking related thoughts and experiences for the last week. In the past, I would just write things down and thought that was important. It was important and helped clear my head/rationalize how stupid it was to do what I desperately wanted. Then I would forget the journal somewhere and I couldn't read it. Now I have an online blog (you can read it [here](http://journalofanexsmoker.wordpress.com/) if you want) where I write all this stuff down and when I want a cigarette, sometimes it's better just to read through some of the stuff to remind myself why I shouldn't. 

* Acting healthier. I've run more in the past week and I'm eating better. I feel like I can't smoke again because that would go against the type of lifestyle I'm leading. If I was eating Big Macs and drinking like I used to in college, then, well fuck it. I might as well smoke. 

* I've been slowly easing myself into smoking situations. I had brunch with a friend who smokes and rode in his car while he smoked. I also went to a bar where you could smoke and had 3 or 4 beers with a different (non-smoking friend). Alcohol is a big trigger for me, so I'm slowly trying to get comfortable with drinking and not-smoking. Hopefully in a month or so I'd be alright getting blitzed and not thinking about cigarettes. Same with other situations like taking a break. I still like to go to the smoking area at work and talk with my co-workers. It doesn't mean that I have to smoke a cigarette.

* Constantly reminding myself that I'm a non-smoker and (I know this sounds bad) I'm better than smokers. When one of them walks in to my office I hold my head a little higher because I know I've done something that they can't. I'm not going to lie, one of the main reasons why I smoked is because I was trying to fit into a certain type of personality. I need to change the image of what a smoker is in my head. So when I think of smoking, I think of this complete fucking douchebag that I know, who smokes, named Jesse. I don't think of Clint Eastwood. I have to constantly remind myself that smokers are gross, smelly, not sexy, assholes, and lack the drive to quit. I really don't care if I'm stereotyping. I need something in my head as powerful as 27 years of pro-cigarette marketing to counter-balance it.
