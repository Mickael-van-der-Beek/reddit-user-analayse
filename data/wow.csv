That’s about all the time we have for the evening. We’d like to extend a special thanks to the administrators of /r/WoW for helping to foster an awesome gaming community. Please extend your gratitude for their efforts here! And thank you as well. Hopefully this has been insightful for everyone reading or posting along -- it was extremely helpful for us to see all of your questions and comments. We truly appreciate your feedback and can’t wait for the mists to part on September 25!

Whether on reddit, the official Blizzard forums, or elsewhere, we always love to hear from you! Feel free to follow Greg Street, Dave Kosak, lead content designer Cory “Mumper” Stockton (he’s sad he couldn’t be here today to chat with you), and me on Twitter:

Hello, and welcome to the first World of Warcraft Developer AMA on reddit! My name is Jonathan Brown, better known as Blizzard Entertainment community manager Zarhym. I’ll be facilitating today’s chat and am joined by lead quest designer Dave “Fargo” Kosak, lead encounter designer Ion “Watcher” Hazzikostas, lead systems designer Greg “Ghostcrawler” Street, and game director Tom “Kalgan” Chilton. 


Our goal for the next hour or so is to answer questions you have pertaining to patch 5.0.4, Mists of Pandaria, and everything in between regarding World of Warcraft story, content, encounter, and systems design. We’ll try to get to as many questions as we can -- I’ll even be responding to some of the less design-intensive inquiries -- but please be sure to vote on what questions you do or don’t think we should answer.

So I went through every video on the MMO-Champ preview and made quick notes of what I feel were the most important things to note on each boss. [Source:](http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2938-Mists-of-Pandaria-Live-This-Week!)


I'll be using these to copy-paste into /party each time before a new boss. I remember spending 5 minutes before each new cata fight and I don't want that to happen again. I'm doing it once and that's it!  

I hope this helps!  

**NOTE: This information MAY be dated/changed, please let me know in the comments and I will update it accordingly.**  

##**UPDATE: This has been so popular I will try to make one for raid bosses tonight. If it isn't up tonight it won't be up for a few days since I'll be playing. Apologies for all the people getting upset over this, you can play the game however you like! This was merely supposed to be a tool for those of us who are going to be grinding dungeons to 90 and don't want to be re-typing every single explanation. Enjoy guys!**

----------

##**Temple of the Jade Serpent**

**Wise Mari**

- Avoid water as much as possible. Come to back of room to kill water ele's first. He'll spin the whole time, avoid his water spout while avoiding water on the ground and DPS'ing.

**There are different bosses that can spawn here, choose the appropriate one!**

**Lots of fucking suns boss**

- DPS all the suns down, tank get ready to pick up a stream of shadow adds. Once everything is dead, the monk will get possessed, simply tank and spank him down.

**Anger &amp; Strife**

- Doing damage causes a debuff on the boss. At 10 stacks they become immune and do MASSIVE damage. Stay on the same target, do as much damage in between immunities, pop defensive cooldowns during immunities.

**Liu Flameheart**

- Avoid flame waves. Avoid fire on the ground. Only the tank should be in front of the boss.

**Sha of Doubt**

- Phase 1: Spread out, do as much damage as possible before immunity.

- Phase 2: EVERYONE stack up and DPS down the adds as fast as possible. If adds DO NOT die they explode for huge damage and it'll probably be a wipe.

----------

##**Stormstout Brewery**

**Ook-Ook**

- Everyone but tank get behind him. Avoid his frontal-cone ground-pound, avoid getting hit by barrels. Both of these do damage and stun you.

**Gauntlet**

- This is a gauntlet, you can pick up hammers that they drop and use them to AOE. The TNT they drop HURTS, try to avoid it. Please keep moving through the whole time, the monsters will never stop spawning.

**Hoptallus**

- Get out of his Furlwind. Avoid his Carrot Breath when he spins slowly in a circle. Tank be ready to pick up lots of adds and DPS need to AOE them down. They still drop TNT and Hammers so pickup hammers for AOE and avoid TNT.

**Yan-Zhu the Uncasked NOTE! This fight can be different! If you have the jump debuff, use the 1st description. If the boss has 3 buffs allowing him to cast multiple spells, use the 2nd description**

- You can jump VERY high this fight. When he casts Bubble Shield, jump up and attack the bubbles above him, then get back on the boss, the bubbles reduce the damage he takes. Also, jump high and avoid the beer waves that come across the room.

- Most important thing is to kill his adds, they heal him. SPREAD OUT! Destroy his bubble shield when he casts it. When bubbles appear around the room, click them and fly upward to avoid damage. If you are hit with Blackout Brew keep moving until it falls off.

----------

##**Mogu'shan Palace**

**1st Bosses**

- Kai the brute, healer heal the pets target, tank avoid the shockwave. Ming the cunning, avoid whirlwinds, interrupt lightning bolts, run out during hurricane. Haiyan the unstoppable, dispel conflagurate, STACK on meteor target to split damage.

**Gekkan**

- Each add gives him a buff, Ironhide reduces their damage taken, Skulker stuns, Oracle heals, Hexer casts stacking debuff on random player. CC appropriately.

**Xin the weaponmaster**

- Avoid his weapons, staff and axe spin so get out, don't stand in front of him to avoid his ground slam. At 66% and 33% health traps go off. Blade trap avoid the ground pattern, crossbow trap just heal the damage.

----------

##**Siege of Niuzao Temple**

**Please interrupt trash as best you can, they do some strong damage.**

**Vizier Jin'bak**

- The puddle in the middle of the room is the most important thing. It grows over time OR when a sap globule from the outside reaches the middle. 

- The only way to shrink it is to take turns standing in it, so please hop in every now and then but not too much! He can also detonate the puddle and the bigger it is, the more damage it will do to everyone.

**Please keep interrupting trash!** 

**Commander Vo'jak**

- Talk to one of the NPCs

- Waves of mobs will come up the stairs. Healer and Ranged DPS use the tar bombs on the ledge to weaken them as much as possible. If they make it to the top, DPS them down and try to tank them as best as possible.

- When the commander finally comes up the stairs, watch out for his whirlwind and use your defensive cooldowns, he has some very strong melee abilities.

**General Pa'valak**

- He will throw his sword at the ranged, and then charge it. Get out of the way of both, big damage. He casts Bulwark and summons adds. Bombs will land near us, right click the bombs and throw them at the adds + him and his Bulwark. Rinse and repeat.

**Wing Leader Ner'onok**

- If you get hit with his Resin, keep jumping otherwise you get sealed in it. When he lifts off, run back along the bridge and stay behind the walls. Don't jump UNLESS you need to keep Resin from hardening. Get to him and just DPS him.

----------

##**Scarlet Halls**

**Commander Lindon**

- HEALER don't grab a shield, everyone else can. Walk towards the archers and use the shields as cover. When we get to the end, all of the enemies rush at once. Let the tank get aggro on them all and begin to DPS down the adds and then the boss.

**Houndmaster Braun**

- DPS the boss in the middle of the room, tank get ready to pick up constantly streaming dogs. DPS can just stay on the boss, tank AOE is enough to kill them.

**Armsmaster Harlan**

- Simply DPS the boss, tank pickup adds when they spawn. When he jumps to the middle, get ready to move, DO NOT get hit by this or you die. If you're able to dispell Enrages, please dispel him as much as possible.

**Flameweaver Koegler**

- Interrupt and spellsteal/dispell him as much as possible. When he casts Book Burner, stand in his beam. If you dont, the books light on fire and pulse fire the rest of the fight.

- Also be sure to avoid his Dragon's Breath, as he spins 360 and breathes fire.

----------

##**Scarlet Monastery**

**Always prioritize killing the piles first, then start killing the rest.**

**Thalnos the Souldrender**

- Stay out of purple circles on the ground, tank pickup adds and DPS them down, try and kill spirits as fast as possible, if they become empowered zombies they do A LOT of damage so tank pop cooldowns. 

- DPS should stay on the boss, not the empowered zombies.

**Brother Korloff**

- Get out of his firestorm kick once he leaps. Big heals during his channeled punches. At 50% tank you MUST kite him around, melee DPS do not stand in the fire.

**Clear ALL trash before pulling.**

**Commander Durand**

- Same as the old version. When she resurrects him, focus HER down and interrupt her Mass Rez if she casts it otherwise she revives every single mob in here. Once she's dead, kill him, done.

----------

##**Scholomance**

**Instructor Chillheart**

- An ice wall will form and move towards us slowly. It INSTANTLY kills you if you touch it. Stay spread out at all times. After he casts Touch of the Grave, tank, pop a CD. Get out of ice circles on the ground.

- When he dies, we need to kill his Phylactery as fast as possible. Avoid the fire and ice books as much as you can, and DPS hard!

**Jandice Barov**

- EVERYONE including the tank, needs to get out of the way of Wondrous Rapidity. It's channeled frontal cone damage, she won't spin, just get behind her.

- At 66% and 33% she splits into duplicates. Single target them all down until the real one is found. Rinse and repeat, AVOID HER CHANNEL!

**Rattlegore**

- Make sure you find an orange glowing bone pile and right click it. If you get hit with Bone Spike this armor will fall off, if it does, go right click another bone pile. 

- Avoid blue fire. His damage increases over the fight so tank, save D cooldowns for after 50%.

**Lilian Voss**

- Three phases, Phase 1: Spread out! When she pulls us in, we start to leave trails of fire. Keep running around until this ends and stay out of fire best you can.

- Phase 2: Stay spread out. She will fixate on someone and that person must run away from her.

- Phase 3: Everything combined. Think of it as phase 1 but if you get fixated, you need to kite. She still pulls as all in and we need to run away/stay out of fire. Be careful of getting fixated and kite when you need to!

**Pull these Bored Students carefully! They do a lot of damage!**  

**Professor Slate is a tank and spank.**  

**Darkmaster Gandling**  

- When he casts Rise! He takes 50% less damage, so spend all your damage on AOE'ing the adds he summons.
He will cast Harsh Lesson randomly, DPS need to kill all the adds and you can come back to the fight. 

- Healers/Tanks look for mobs to dispel, when you do, this makes killing all the adds MUCH easier. Dispel all the mobs you can, then kill adds and come back.

----------

##**Shadow-Pan Monastery**

**Gu Cloudstrike**

- Phase 1: Don't stand in lightning on the ground. 

- Phase 2: He becomes immune. We need to kill his dragon. Stay away from the dragons breath and tail and SAFELY stack up near the side of the dragon. Spam heals when the debuff goes out.

- Phase 3: DPS Race, do as much damage as possible. There's no way to avoid his AOE damage!

**Master Snowdrift**

- Tank will gather all the adds and we DPS them down, then we fight master snowdrift. Get behind his Fist of Fury, he will not follow you. Get out of his Tornado Kick.

**Taran Zhu**

- Don't let your hatred get to full, if it's getting close, click the meditate skills and don't move until your hatred dies down. Stay out of his shadow bolt AOE circle, either be IN it or OUT of it.

- Gripping Hatred spheres pull us in, GET OUT of the purple ASAP and meditate AFTER you're out if you need to. DO NOT meditate while standing in the purple.

Found ourselves talking through entire nights and eventually we started using webcams. A year or so ago she flew across the world (Hawaii) to me (Connecticut) to come live with me. Never meeting me she put her complete faith in a stranger. (the reasoning why she couldn't return is a long painful story that boils down to religion..) She choose me over everything she knew, an opportunity for a life long partner created by a silly game. Last night with my grandmothers ring I asked her to marry me! She said yes! 

There is a lot I left out... Nearly all of the hardships, judgment, and drama we had to endure. I see couples on wow all the time that are picked on, but I also see people staying together. Don't be afraid to fight for what you believe in, even if no one else does. 

Edit:
A picture at the airport meeting in person for the first time
http://imgur.com/hqRcZ (I'm 19 shes 18) 

Edit: Thank you so much for your love guys! I love to read your own stories. Also I've gotten the ""you're too young speech."" (We started talking when I was 15  and I am currently 20 and she is 19, I am the youngest in my family to get married - She is the oldest... Hawaii is weird.)  We are quite young and statistics will tell us it is a large risk but this isn't a flute thing, we have talked about it for a year. That being said everything cannot be predicted and we are well aware of this, we thought we had it all figured out when she first came here. Reality has slapped us in the face many times over and we know it will continue. We will always support one another and I believe that can be determined at a young age.

Post",ckernan2,1221,202,251,http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1f7vsr/your_53_just_hit_90_what_do_i_do_post/,"The post I made in regards to what you do when you hit level 90 caught some steam, but now things are different, so I'll try to sum them up here.

* Get to the Skies.  Purchase flying for 2500g (easily acquired by questing 89-90)

* Visit Wrathion.  He is located in an area pinched by Kun-lai Summit, Valley of Four Winds, and Jade Forest.  Acquire your Legendary Quest.

* Head to your capital city (Orgrimmar or Stormwind) and acquire pop-up quest to head to the Isle of Thunder

* Head to the Isle of Thunder and complete the scenarios that open up the Island of Thunder's phasing to current day

* Find yourself a Trove of the Thunder King (rare chest) or a rare mob on the Isle of Thunder.  Acquire a Key to Lei Shen's Treasure Trove.  

* Complete the Treasure Trove scenario by opening up every chest you see.  Focus on acquiring every chest you see, regardless of size, in the first room, left side of the hallway to the 2nd room, and the 2nd room.  Head to Youtube for best pathing guides.  Pray for Burial Trove Keys and make a goal to get approximately 15-16 Elder Charms of Good Fortune.  If you acquire enough rep tokens to make it to Honored, make sure you visit the Quartermaster and purchase a 476 belt for approximately 425g.

* Head to Cho's place and complete his quests to do the two new scenarios, Blood in the Snow and Dark Heart.  Each of these will reward you with a chest and 50 Valor.  The chest has a chance to give you a piece of loot for your current loot specialization of 463 item level.

* Attempt to get in a Sha of Anger kill as well as a Galleon kill.  Use 2 of your Elder Charms of Good Fortune and may the RNG gods treat you well.  With any luck, you'll acquire anywhere from 1 to 4 pieces of 496 gear.

* Head to Durotar (unsure of Alliance equivalent) and do the small event chain that opens up the weekly quest to gather 150 of each resource from the Northern Barrens (avoiding details to not spoil plot).  Make sure you get into a group that is killing the Commanders to acquire lots of resources fast (should kill about 6-8 Commanders for 150 of each resource)

* When you acquire your Mojo when turning in weekly quest (+200 Valor), check to see if you looted a particular purple token piece of armor.  If so, combine this with your Mojo to create a piece of gear appropriate for your loot specialization with a 489 item level.  If you don't pick one up, head to the AH and see if you can find Latent Kor'kron Armor for around 1k gold.  If so, buy.  

* Head to Kun-lai Summit with your quest and help the old Panda up the mountain.  Acquire item level 502 boots for your troubles.  

* If you are using a weapon that is less than 450 item level, queue for the scenario ""Arena of Annihilation"" and complete it.  This will reward you 1 450 item level weapon.  For you Rogues, Enhance Shamans, and 2H DKs, you'll have to acquire weapons from LFR or Heroics

* With any luck, you have reached 460 item level and can queue for MSV LFR.  On your first pass through, make sure you use a Elder Charm of Good Fortune on each boss if he can drop an upgrade for you.  The chance to get gear from T14 LFR has been greatly increased.  

From here on out, your gearing strategy will be tied to RNG.  Once you complete all of LFR MSV, hope that your item level is 470.  If it is not, do random Heroic Dungeons and collect any loot you can.  Your item level is boosted by gear you don't even equip as long as you are ABLE to equip it.  Acquire 463 blues and spend 750 Justice Points to upgrade them to 471 item level.  With some preserverance, you can enter LFR Heart of Fear and Terrace of Endless Spring.  

Once you get to 470, you'll be tied into more luck with getting drops, but your goal is to do anything you can to get to 480 item level.  In order to get to 480, continue to run LFR HoF and ToES.  You can use your Elder Charms on bonus loot even after you have already downed a boss in a particular week.  Spend all of your tokens.  You'll either 1) run out of tokens or 2) get to 480.  If you run out, try again the following week with 15+ new chances at loot by repeating your Treasure Trove Run.  Also make sure that you acquire 50 Lesser Charms of Good Fortune to acquire 3 Mogu Runes at the lowest floor at your Pandaria capital city and go kill Oondasta and Nalak.  Use one Mogu Rune on each.  If you hit 480, do the following:

* Acquire the quest ""Heroic Deeds"" and find/form a group of 3 and queue for a random Heroic Scenario.  By completing any random Heroic Scenario, you will get a guaranteed random 516 item level item.  I got a 516 cloak the first time I did this, so I'm not sure what all drops.

* At 480, Throne of Thunder LFR is open to you allowing you access to everything available at this point.  Spend your Mogu Runes appropriately (in Throne of Thunder LFR, but only if you're unable to do regular modes) on Oondasta and Nalak.

Best of luck to all of you as you gear out your new 90's!

After some thinking, I decided to hold a giveaway for the community. The giveaway will be once a day starting Friday and going through Sunday. The first giveaways will be large posters that I got and a T-shirt. Sunday's giveaway will be the mousepad autographed by blizzard. I have set some rules and they will be as follows:

* You must post from a reddit account that is longer than 1 week old.
* If you win anything on Friday or Saturday, you will be ineligible to participate again; however, you can still participate on the mousepad giveaway.
* The thread must have more than 100 upvotes before the giveaway starts. This ensures that a lot of people get a chance to participate.


The giveaway winner will be determined as follows:


After the 100th upvote is received I will post up a riddle. This riddle will be about an NPC located in the World of Warcraft. In order to win, you must locate the NPC and do whatever other tasks the riddle says to do. The first person to submit a screenshot in the thread of the giveaway will win the prize for that particular thread. 




Winners need only provide their contact information so that the goods may be delivered. Everything else will be paid for by myself. Depending on the popularity of the giveaways, I might do this weekly afterward with other wow-related items.




EDIT: Here's the link to the loot: http://i.imgur.com/AkTh6.jpg

I put up a time, but changed my mind because I will probably be asleep by the time I said. I work graveyard, so I want to he awake to monitor the thread just in case people decide to downvote submitters. That said, it will probably take place sometime in the afternoon. Rest assured that it will happen regardless.

I will post the thread around 2-3pm PST.

I started noticing this a little while ago, when he bought the expansion before last. At that time it was harder to notice the symptoms. Now they are coming through clear as can be.

He has become very secluded, has stopped communicating with his ""real"" friends and spends almost all of his free time in game.

Everything started getting really bad when my wife went down to visit him in our basement. I will never forget how horrified she was when she came back. She cried that whole night, and could barely communicate with me what had gone so wrong.

I had to know for myself, I went down and checked. Sure enough, her horror was also my realization. I watched him play the game in dismay. He was a female blood elf rogue, he couldn't CC, and he barely pulled 3k DPS.

When I came upstairs to my wife, she was inconsolable, and my lips quivered to utter the words. ""Our son is a scrub."" I broke down in tears and shame and yelled ""I HAVE NO SON!""

I don't know where we went wrong, I don't know what we did and I don't know what we can do. My wife has stopped speaking to me, and I avoid speaking with my son. She thinks its a phase, she assures me ""He won't always wear leather with intellect on it."" I don't believe her.

I meet said Druid in Stormwind Trade District.  I trade the Druid 3 [Magnificent Hide](http://www.wowhead.com/item=72163) and 8 [Blood Spirit](http://www.wowhead.com/item=80433).  As soon as the trade is completed he logs off.
I sat there dumbfounded for about 5 minutes.  I wrote up an ingame ticket to Blizzard with all the times, items, names etc.  Then decided to look up the Druids guild and talk to his GM.  Turns out the Druids GM was his dad and they have one Battle.net account but multiple WoW accounts.  5 minutes after I talk to his dad the Druid logs back on, apologizes and gives me all my mats back.

TL;DR
Someone tried to ninja 20k g worth of mats from me.  I talked to his GM/dad.  Kid got pimp slapped and I got my mats back.",,False,self,t5_2qio8,False,,alliance-rogue,True,t3_15kzyy,http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/15kzyy/this_really_happened/,

So I'm doing my random dungeon, leveling my Mage and two guys join the group. their name was like Alansdk and alansdruid or something. The one was a healer and was incredibly slow. He would just walk around, enjoying the scenary. 

We eventually get up to the boss and he says ""not so bad for a 6 year old?"" And I was blown away. ""Yeah he's on auto follow on me, he just likes to do the attacks..""

And then I just started bawling. I might have said something really nasty like ""FFS HURRY UP AND HEAL YOU RETARD""

and just picturing his little boy smiling on his lap, defeating the evil dragon at the end of the ramparts together with his pop 

Who I am to tell anyone how to play the game. And for a moment I even got depressed thinking about my own father. 

This game means a lot of different things to a lot of different people and the innocence of this random family in a random group just killed me. It really was one of the most beautiful things I've experienced in the game. 


Sorry for the rant. This probably won't make any sense to anyone but me.

EDIT: wow! Thanks everyone. A lot of the things about LFG are true, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that what got to me the most here is that I'll never enjoy the game as much as that father/son.

1360597011.0,737,self.wow,18b90c,Played World of Warcraft for the first time this weekend,SoCal_Sapper,931,194,589,http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/18b90c/played_world_of_warcraft_for_the_first_time_this/,"Hello,

So I thought I would share my experience regarding my first time playing World of Warcraft this weekend. I've played a lot of other MMOs including EVE, PotBS, Lord of the Rings Online and many others and I've got to say that I think WoW is pretty frigging awesome. 

I created a human Paladin because I thought the bonus to swords and maces would come in handy while leveling up while giving me a nice bonus when I hit level cap. The first thing that struck me was how beautiful the landscape and colors are in WoW. A lot of games are visually attractive in their own ways (see the eveporn subreddit), but I really like the cartoony character textures and high fantasy setting really lends itself to my need to escape from RL to relax and unwind over the weekend. 

So far I'm level 17 and have been doing the quests in Westfall. The coolest thing I've seen in this zone has to be the cyclone with the land and trees swirling around. I wonder what had been there before that cyclone (energy vortex?) hit the site. I also thought the memory sequence in the Deadmines was pretty awesome too. 

For professions I've taken up mining and jewelry crafting. Ore is pretty plentiful so far but I'm having a hard time finding tin, which sucks because smelting copper isn't giving me points anymore. Luckliy the Deadmines has a couple nodes and I hung around in there for abit and picked up 11 tin ore which helped raise my smelting and jewelry crafting to new heights. For secondary professions I've only tried out first aid, but that's about it. I'm really interested in seeing how Archaeology works but I cant get that until level 20.

The only frustrating thing I've run into is the 72 hour rule when switching over from a starter edition to the normal edition. I cant talk in local chat channel or a few other things. Oh well, my 72 hours will be up on Tuesday.

Overall, I'm really excited about playing this game. I hope the level grind doesn't become unbearable at higher levels but I'm staying optimistic.

tl;dr - I played WoW for the first time this weekend. I like it.

EDIT: Thanks for the positive comments everyone! I really appreciate the time you are putting in to give me tips on how to enjoy WOW to the fullest. I've been getting messages from people to add their battletags and I will do so. If you'd like me to add you as a friend please send me a message with your info and I'll add you the next time I'm on. You can never have too many friends.

This idea has come from my discovery of the Ablegamers Foundation (ablegamer.org). I myself am a parent of a mentally disabled child. In the past I have used un-schooling techniques to help my stepson with Autism with keyboarding, reading, map skills, and arithmetic through crafting and the use of the auction house.  All children are welcomed and can even become mentors to other players. I am mostly a daytime and early evening player. I will be looking for another parent to mentor later in the evening if we have those who play later than I do. The goals of this Guild are to foster an environment where all can ask for help with progressing in the game in any way that individual likes to play. Whether it is in dungeons, pet battles, crafting, PvP or with build of character. This will be a completely low-key casual way of play fostering teamwork, helpfulness and kindness.  If interested please leave a comment here or in game to Elderdov on Nesingwary (US). 

PLEASE NOTE: We are not exclusive by any means. All I am asking for is for people who join keep in mind we are G-rated, casual and willing to answer a question if someone needs assistance.",,False,self,t5_2qio8,1366401849.0,,horde,True,t3_1cowm0,http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1cowm0/attention_parents_stayathome_dads_and_moms/,

Since all the cool kids are doing one, we thought we'd do one too and give you guys a chance to ask us everything from things about WoW to things about running a large fansite :)

I have with me here today myself (site director) and Perculia (senior content manager). Fewyn (content manager) and SpiffyJr (senior PHP developer) may chime in time to time as well. 

I'll try to have us answer most things--be sure to upvote questions you really want answered! We'll be answering questions for about an hour, but we might come back a few hours later and answer more if this really takes off.

Thanks guys! Looking forward to seeing what you have to ask us :)

I am unhappy about the announced expansion. So because of that, I am going to vent my anger at everyone on this forum, because I expect you all to somehow care about what I think, despite the fact that you don't know me or have any reason to care, I will nontheless tell you anyway.

I have been playing this game for an amount of time, which somehow makes my opinion worth something. And based on that, I think that Pandaren will totally destroy this game. 

There are any number of reasons why. Here are some of them.

1- The inclusion of these pandas will make the game very childish. I want a game full of magic and dragons which is not childish. I want a very serious and grown-up game where I can throw fireballs at goblins without pandas anywhere.

2- There is no lore about Pandaren at all, and this somehow means that the developers shouldn't try to make any or create any. Creativity sucks. I want the same kind of thing we have seen a hundred times before. 

3- The inclusion of Pandaria and its exotic oriental atmosphere will totally ruin the exotic atmosphere of the game. Just like how the inclusion of Outland and the exotic atmosphere of it ruined Azeroth before. 

4- Pandas are dumb. 

5- Having semi-animal type people will attract furries to the game. I'm glad we don't have any of them already. 

6- Pandaren are a joke race. They are only there for comedy. Blizzard has never made joke races playable before. So they shouldn't now. And on that subject, goblins are totally serious and not a joke, guys. 

Despite the fact that this game is the most popular MMO on the market, this expansions clearly shows that it is dying. Don't ask me to explain why, it just is. I am going to switch to Star Wars instead, because clearly that is a franchise that still has a lot of life left in it, and has very very grown-up races like wookies and ewoks. 

I also noticed that they are wanting to make it possible for our vanity pets to DO THINGS!! WTF is up with that? I like my pets to just sit there and look nice and be utterly inactive. Doing things is stupid. 

So yeah, good job Blizzard, I am totally quitting this game for ever and ever and ever, until I come back. Which I won't. Promise. Hah! You guys are totally losing out here. While you're playing with your childish martial arts bears, I'll be swinging around a laser sword and zapping bad guys like a real grown-up gamer!

I really hope Blizzard loses all of its subscribers because of this, because they deserve to be punished because of my dislike of their development choices! That would definitely teach them for making a game with this type of content. I pray for their financial destruction, because I am SO INSANELY RIDICULOUSLY ANGRY at this for some reason!!",,False,self,t5_2qio8,False,,warlock,True,t3_loswn,http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/loswn/pandaren_fuck_this_im_quitting/,

***
A little about me to get things started: I'm 28, born and raised in Battle Creek, Michigan which is where my wife and I currently reside. I'm currently employed as Site Director of Tankspot, where I also host The Weekly Marmot and PST. On top of that, I produce and co-host Legendary on Gamebreaker.TV, and just recently started a new series called ""On Tap"" on my own Youtube channel where I look at games outside of WoW.

I've been playing WoW since beta, and started raiding in Classic around the time AQ released. I became Raid Leader of Months Behind in TBC, and took over as Guild Master in WOTLK. We were a top 100 guild during TBC (and I was one of the first Paladins to tank Illidan), but have been leaning a bit more casual since Wrath and Cataclysm.

Any question is fair game, although please recognize that there are likely to be topics I can't discuss. I'll try to answer as much as I can though!

UPDATE: Heading out for a bit to grab some dinner with the wife! I'll answer more when I get back, so feel free to keep asking :)

WoW turned to shit after BC!"" I for one do not agree with these claims.

The reason so many people say that Vanilla was the best is due to nostalgia and the social aspect of it. If you really compare the game play of Vanilla to Cata you'll find that it is not the best. Questing was boring an it took forever to grind your way to level 60, raiding took hours, 40mans were a nightmare, and the classes were inferior to how they are now. Sure some people stood out because of their gear but I never really found that very important.
Just because they make the game more fun, easier to level, and to get gear doesn't mean they're trying to appeal to casuals. The ""hardcore"" gamers can still hate fun and spend hours in raids to get the best gear. They don't even have to get badges. 
WoW isn't dead, it's just evolved into a better game. I just wish people would take off their nostalgic glasses and quit complaining, I suppose that's too much to ask for.",,False,self,t5_2qio8,False,,,True,t3_tendv,http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/tendv/vanilla_wow_the_truth/,

(Vanilla, TBC, WLK, etc)",Wiltron,730,135,270,http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1ier8u/q_would_rwow_be_interested_in_solo_raid_guides/,"I find re-running old content is fun as hell. It gives me a bunch of gold, and farming for battle pets and transmog gear is a nice bonus, however some of the bosses still require some strategy. While most are a faceroll ""shut up and hit the skull"" strategy, last night I found that Viscidious and Twin Emps in AQ40 actually had me searching for how to do it online after I had to run away (from vis.) and wiped (from emps).

I can clear almost all the pre-80 raids in a single night, as a 471 Frost DK. That includes clearing MC, BWL, AQ20/40, Kara, SSC, BT, TK, Sunwell, in about 5 hours total. I'm starting to hit up Naxx25 but still perfecting my strategies and what not.

So, tonight when I run through my normal routine of the above, should I fraps and start the process of video documenting how to do it for this community? Or would I be wasting my time?

**EDIT 1: Karazhan video will be first, not MC**

**EDIT 2: DUE TO POPULAR DEMAND I will be recording only mechanics based fights. If the boss fight is a simple ""hit him with that sharp thing until he's dead"" then there's no need to watch me do it. If you actually have to do something, then I'll record it.**

**EDIT 3: I've shortened the Kara video to be ONLY the chess event. Every single boss fight in that place is a tank and spank, so the entire video was boring as hell. The video itself is uploading, and will be up in ~4hrs (2GB of full 1080p HD goodness.. will be up around noon EST)**

He has been since way back in Warcraft II, and has several items displaying the horde symbol or horde information.  For some background my husband is also 5'11"", Hispanic, and highly muscular.  He dresses in all black most of the time, just because then he doesn't have to worry about  matching colors.  He was wearing [this cap](http://images.superherostuff.com/image-capwowhordesym-primary-watermark.jpg) to Walmart the other day to pick up some items we needed.

As he was walking down the isle, an older lady got in front of him.  He tried to pass her but she stepped right back in front of him again.  After a few times of this and a couple of ""Excuse me""s from him, he stopped and asked her if there was a problem.  

The older lady looks at him and says ""I don't like you gang types!  I don't want you in my store making some trouble.""  This confused my husband, because as I stated he was wearing plain black clothes and his horde hat.  

My husband says to her ""I don't know what you mean.""

The older lady pointed at his hat and said ""You people and your gang symbols.  Why do you have to be coming in here?""

My husband at that point tried to explain to the lady what the symbol on the hat was, but she would have none of it and continued to block his path.  By this point there was no way he could go around, our Walmart is in the middle of a remodel with very tiny isles and people had started getting behind him, waiting to pass.  Frustrated my husband finally yells ""Loktar!"" at the lady and she gets all in a panic, running off. This was met with laughter by a bunch of the other patrons in the store that had overheard the whole thing and my husband goes to finish his shopping.

Unfortunately the lady went to security, and they escorted my husband out.  Not before having a laugh with him and letting him cut in the line to check out with his purchases.  Just goes to show you meet the strangest people in Walmart.

Edit: fixed my husband's height, he got offended I left off an inch.  lol.",,False,self,t5_2qio8,True,,,True,t3_r8i8m,http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/r8i8m/wow_misunderstanding/,

I was home alone playing WoW up in my room, headset on, talking to people in vent through my speakers. 

Fast forward a few hours. My father comes home and immediately comes into my room. He drags me downstairs and asks why there's glass on the floor. We had recently moved into a new house and our front door had big glass panels on it which were now shattered all over the floor. We noticed that the glass panels had been broken so that someone could reach in and open the door (at the time we kept a key inside the lock of the door). Nothing seemed to be missing but we filed a police report and eventually all went to sleep with metal baseball bats next to our beds. 

A couple weeks later we hear back from the police. They ended up catching the criminal who had been chain breaking and entering houses recently. He confessed that he had decided against stealing anything from my house because he claimed that he had ""heard people upstairs"" and had ran. In sum, my WoW ventrillo buddies yelling profanities and other crazy things scared a would-be criminal away.

Amazing guy, the kind of guy that will always be ready to help anyone. He would help you quest, he would coach you if you had bad dps, he even built a prot set just to help people get faster queues. 

But one day, he didn't show up for a raid. And then, he didn't even appear online for a few days. A couple of days later, we got a message from his father on the guild forums. He was killed on a car accident. He was only 23, and his family and girlfriend were devastated, as everyone in the guild as well. We offered our condolences to the family and raided as a 24 man group for about a month, not wanting to replace him.

Time passed, and one day... we saw him online. He would not answer to whispers and suddenly logged off. And back on, after a few hours, and his toon was standing in the middle of Orgrimmar, not moving. We were horrified, thinking someone hacked his account. But we were wrong.

It was his father. He knew that WoW was a big part of his son's life and he felt that, somehow, playing his toon would keep his memory alive. He didn't answer whispers at first, simply because he didn't know how to. He was completely new at the game, but wanted to learn, from scratch, as a sort of ""homage"" to his son. And we taught him. We stood with him for hours and hours, trying to give him back all the time and effort that his son gave to us. And he actually became a pretty good Ret pally! He ended up filling his son's spot on the raid, and was key to our first Lich King kill. Since then, i moved on from that guild and realm, but last time i checked, he was still playing on that pally, keeping his son's memory alive. I guess he succeded.


So, do you have any other stories to share? I would love to hear them! It reminds us that there are real people behind those sprites in the screen.

(For obvious reasons, i'm not going to give names here)

EDIT : I checked his armory again. It seems he stopped playing in april this year. I guess he finally moved on, but his efforts helped everyone on a very hard time.

**FAQ**

Here are some questions that have popped up often and some answers to them, along with resources where you can learn more.

* **How can I make gold without professions?**

While more professions will allow you to make more gold there are a few ways to make gold without using professions.

*Transmog Flipping:* Buying good-looking items when they are posted for cheap; reselling them higher to people using them for transmogrification outfits.  Jim's done a great compilation for this which can be found [here.](http://hatchery.powerwordgold.net/2012/08/the-definitive-transmog-shopping-list.html)

*Darkmoon Card Flipping:* Buying MoP-level Darkmoon Cards when they are cheap (when the faire isn't in town, usually) and selling them when they are most expensive; usually on the last day of the faire.

*Vendor Item Reselling:* Vendors all over the game sell recipes, pets, and other items which lazy or unknowing players will buy at a markup from the AH.  [Here's an old video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zODFJ-moe0&amp;list=PL9D33AC051DED029E&amp;index=10&amp;feature=plpp_video) that gives you some places to start. (Note it's on my old channel, if you want the new channel it's [here.](http://www.youtube.com/goclockworkriot))

*Arbitrage:* Buying items on one faction where they are very cheap and using the Neutral AH to move them to the more expensive faction for selling.

*83-84 Greens Flipping:* Leveling players like to have the best stats and often you can buy MoP-item-level greens to sell to players who gear up at the Auction House. Jim did [a post about this](http://www.powerwordgold.net/2012/09/level-83-84-mists-items-time-to-stock-up.html) a while back.

* **What is the most profitable profession to have?**

This will vary by server as well as by how much time you can put into your gold-making. Generally speaking the most well-represented gold-making professions are Jewelcrafting, Enchanting, and Alchemy.  All professions can make gold but you'll likely see higher returns from these three and lower returns from less-popular professions like Engineering or Skinning.

* **I'm new to the game or on a new server, how do I make starting gold?**

The best way to get started on a new server or if you're new to the game is to level your characters with mining and herbalism. This will allow you to gather materials while leveling. Sell everything you gather on the Auction House and by the time you hit 90 you'll have a good amount of starting gold and can then choose which professions you'd like to focus on for gold-making.

Basically all you need to do is get the Tom Tom addon, make the following six macros and then hit them. It will put markers up for every spot where a lore object exists and the tom tom arrow will always point you to the next one. It shouldn't take even an hour to get exalted.

The six macros you will need to make are as follows:

After doing the math and finding that I'm about 12-14 dungeons away from level 90, I'm on a mission. 2... 3... 4... the 5th horrible dungeon group in a row, I lost it. Rude 'yolo' assholes, bad healers, afking DPSs... Frost Mage was blinking ahead and pulling everything. We were in Shado-Pan Monastery and after repeated attempts at talking to this assclown, I decided to be the bigger asshole, ""Fine Mage tank, do it!"". I turned off Righteous Fury (pallies aggro buff) and as he blinked into the boss instance (Master Snowdrift) before everyone else, I cast Avengers Shield, locking the instance to everyone else. I cast Hand of Salvation on myself, losing 2% threat a second, and Hand of Protection, freeing myself from harm. Mage caught aggro and I cheered (/cheer) for him for about 30 seconds until he died. I then spend the next 14 minutes and 42 seconds slowly soloing the boss by myself. Whole team is locked out except for the dead mage. They're all backing the mage in trash talking me, ""if you did your job and pulled, then mage wouldn't have pulled"". I've been tanking for a while. I may not be the best tank, but queuing with my other alts, I can say I'm a pretty damn good tank. I get the boss down to 2%, and stop. I just let him kill me. The team was LIVID! But I say, fuck it. I got kicked, needless to say. In a game where 12 year olds shout profanities that cause sailors to blush, the healer actually said, ""People as rude as you shouldn't be allowed to play this game"". So, am I an asshole or a hero?

**edit: I pull fast, that wasn't the issue and in this dungeon you're pretty much forced to take it mob by mob up until Snowdrift.**",,False,self,t5_2qio8,1349959705.0,,paladin,True,t3_119e2w,http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/119e2w/am_i_an_asshole_or_a_hero/,
