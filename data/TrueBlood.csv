If it's not Bill, Eric, or Sookie doing their random love triangle thing (no logic or reason in any of those guys) and dealing with the monster of the season, its one of the subsidiary character arches that takes screen time and is almost always completely irrelevant to the main plot. Because of that, the supporting characters' relationship with the main cast is fading, and no one really cares about them. I was a fan of True Blood, truly, but it has fallen to a level of mediocrity even I can't convince myself to push through.

If someone has good arguments for me to stay with this show please give them, because that season premiere rough. ",,False,,t5_2r39t,False,,,True,t3_1gnlyp,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueBlood/comments/1gnlyp/true_blood_has_lost_the_qualities_of_a_quality/,

He gave me some info I haven't seen elsewhere, but there were plenty of things he wasn't allowed to tell me, so I don't know who Warlow is or anything like that.

1) HBO gave them the same budget for season 5 as for season 4... but gave all of the actors substantial raises, so they had to cut back on a lot of effects and start removing actors like Hoyt

2) Jason was going to be a werepanther, but the writers changed their minds, which is why the whole storyline disappeared abruptly

3) Warlow is a new actor, but he wouldn't confirm whether the actor had been cast for the role yet

4) There will be a romance relating to Warlow in some way.

5) Every time they bring on a new director, they have to learn the hard way that the show works a lot better when they don't take it too seriously. This is also one of the reasons why seasons seem to be so inconsistent

edit: The guy playing Warlow in the flashbacks was just a stuntman, so there's no point in trying to figure out what Warlow looks like from that.

edit 2: I can't believe I forgot to mention this, but Alexander Skarsgard apparently responds to every letter he receives.

But he paves that road with the blood of countless faeries and humans due to his darkness.

I was rewatching 6x02 again, and Eric's sister was reading a very important passage from the Vampire Bible.

""And so it was that the progeny led Lilith to the sun.  And So it shall be again.""  

  It was 'people' instead of 'progeny', until Eric's sister correctly translated it to progeny.  That quote tells us that Warlow killed Lilith, and according to the Bible he will kill her again.  The rest of the vampire bible quote is as follows..

""As the blood ascends, two will become one.  When light and dark collide, our salvation is at hand.""

From this all I can gather is Light and Dark means fae+vampire, and what Warlow has planned with Sookie will be the salvation for vampires+humans?  I like Warlow.

Russel",Phlexonance,120,7,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueBlood/comments/w9q90/s05e05_spoiler_evidence_of_the_identity_of_the/,"**Exhibit A**, screenshot from Sookie's memory reading: http://i.imgur.com/XSyJI.jpg

Notice that the necklace is worn considerably higher than usual so we don't see cleavage (which would be much more *revealing* of the Sanguinista's identity).   
We still see a mole next to the pendant.

**Exhibit B**, super obvious Sanguinista Nora, http://i.imgur.com/H7yCn.jpg, http://i.imgur.com/RTU2q.jpg

Notice how the upper birthmark**s**, which would have appropriate height to match Exhibit A, come in a pair. The fact that we don't see the second mole in Exhibit A is evidence that she was not the one who freed Russel. (Also it would be quite lame as she is the super obvious choice and writers want to surprise us with a ""twist"".)

**Exhibit C**, two screenshots of Salome, http://i.imgur.com/Egj0V.jpg , http://i.imgur.com/ZtyNP.jpg    
We see 3 moles on the upper chest, in a zig-zag pattern. The top one has the proper position and size to possibly be the same one as in Exhibit A.

The other 2 female vampires we've seen in the Authority Lair are the cute iStake chick, but she's part of the staff and not of the Authority per se and doesn't wear that pendant and the old conservative lady.

**Exhibit D**, the old conservative lady, she doesn't have any moles in that region and either wears the symbol as a broche or if it's a pendant, it's on a pearl necklace, http://i.imgur.com/PKGPF.jpg, http://i.imgur.com/h1ihB.jpg, http://i.imgur.com/2mPfG.jpg    
These should be sufficient to rule her out.

Introducing a new vamp for the one who freed Russel would be quite lame, so I assume it's one of those we know.

**Verdict**: Salome is most likely the one who freed Russel

1346086875.0,107,self.TrueBlood,ywtdo,Warlow theories (spoilers),tblurkn,127,20,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueBlood/comments/ywtdo/warlow_theories_spoilers/,"Very curious to see where this is headed.  Some possibilities that had occurred to me:

* **Warlow is a vampire ""biblical"" figure like Lilith -- perhaps the vampire satan?**  
This would explain why Sookie's mom's ghost replies ""watch your language!"" when Warlow's name is mentioned **&lt;*edit -- though as many of you point out, Warlow's name is mentioned in the same sentence as ""fuck"" or ""motherfucker"", so uh...yeah*&gt;**, and would explain why he's drawn to fairies which in the vampire bible are an abomination.  It would also explain Nora's reaction when Jason mentions the name: ""Warlow?  What do you know about Warlow?!!""  -- it's incredulous-but-rapt curiosity, the way you'd respond if someone asked about a fabled figure of great interest rather than some guy you'd simply met (even if that guy were, say, politically powerful).  And Nora's intense curiosity about a figure from vampire mythology would jive with her religious fundamentalism this season.  *This would be disproved if*, in Season 5, any vampire with knowledge of the bible showed a lack of familiarity with Warlow.  Did this happen?


* **Sookie was ""promised"" to Warlow for marriage, not as a snack.**
When Sookie mentions Warlow to the elder fairy, elder says something about destinies being intertwined and notes that this is the reason Sookie sluts her heart out to every cute vampire she meets.  This would also give new meaning to the ""you're mine"" that Warlow utters when he appears in Sookie's bathroom, and would explain why the contract specifies a *female* heir.  Perhaps this theory could tie into the ""vampire satan"" theory, above -- maybe it was foretold that Warlow would try to breed with a fairy and create some sort of fairy/vampire antichrist.   *Edit: The Warlow/Sookie arranged marriage theory also explains why, after smelling the bandaid in the backseat of her parents' car and realizing a fae heir had finally been born, Warlow still remained out of the picture while Sookie was growing up.  Maybe he was waiting to claim her when she came of marriageable age.  

* **Warlow is someone we've met before.**
When asked about this, Alan Ball replied [""no comment""](http://tv.yahoo.com/news/true-blood-season-finale-post-mortem-alan-ball-050024537.html).  So it's a possibility -- but who could Warlow be?  We know it's not Russell because, at the end of Season 3, Russell had to be convinced that fairies existed and that Sookie had fairy blood.  So who else have we met who's an old, powerful vampire?  There's Roman -- but if he dedicated his life to mainstreaming, seems doubtful he'd have slaughtered Sookie's parents that way.  Could Warlow be some shade or version of Bill?  In a way this seems likeliest, since it would tie in with Bill's geneology project re: Sookie's family.  Problem is, the fairy contract was signed in 1702.  Bill would not have been born until the 1800s.  **Two more theories: Istvan (Lorena's maker, whom we have not *actually* met); Godric.**  Both of these strike me as unlikely, but both vampires are old enough to be Warlow.  

If Warlow is someone we've already met, then can we divine clues about his identity based on his ""appearances"" in Season 5?  I dunno.  They might have just had someone stand in for these sequences in anticipation of casting someone on a permanent basis.  Then again, if Warlow *is* someone from the current cast, why not use the ""right"" person to film these sequences?

Observations about the guy who played Warlow in the bridge sequence:

* He's white, male, probably at least in his 40s (you can tell by jawline and [nasolabial folds](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7yi0eU1cQ1ql1t0mo1_500.png)).  
* He's brunette and his hair is at least an inch or so long.  (Look at the full-length shot of him standing in the rain as the headlights hit him).  
* Some of his bottom front teeth are uneven or jumbled together -- maybe you can't see this in his normal smile, but he needs braces.  In another shot he appears to have a gap between his top front teeth, but that may be a trick of the shadows.  

I am not a plastic surgeon or an expert at IDing people, but of the current cast I think the guy who most resembles Warlow is Bill, even though I'd have a hard time believing Bill ""is"" Warlow.

* **Warlow is a fairy who was turned.**  This might explain why Claudine knew him and why he'd enter into a contract written in fairy language.  We know that fairies like to breed with humans and that some fairies believe they must ""harvest"" their descendants -- so Warlow could have been either fairy *or* vampire when the contract was entered into.   Maybe Sookie and Warlow are somehow destined to unite vampire and fairy kind, or destroy vampires altogether (see also ""vampire antichrist"") -- again, would explain how Sookie was *destined* to have some involvement with Warlow and *destined* to fall in love with vampires).  ""Warlow"" also seems like it could be a fairy's name, along the same lines as ""Morella.""  

Other ideas?

**+++Another good theory raised in the comments+++**

* **Warlow's identity is incorporeal/fluid, like Lilith's -- perhaps, over time, different vampires ""become"" Warlow.**  This would jive with Nora's curiosity -- if Warlow was an entity viewed as ""supernatural"" even by vampire standards, of course Nora would be shocked and and eager for every bit of info.  It would also explain Warlow's strange voice and his ability to project his presence into Sookie's bathroom, which is not something we've seen other vampires do.  **Or, Warlow could *really be* ""Lilith,"" or be responsible for the Lilith hallucinations** -- remember, all we know is that the vampires who drank that blood *thought* they were seeing their god.  If Warlow were some demon, warlock, wraith or other magical agency, he could have deceived everyone into thinking they were following Lilith while they were really doing something else entirely.  Now Warlow has inhabited or possessed Bill, which would explain why the Warlow we've ""seen"" vaguely resembles Bill.  It would also explain why, when Sookie entered the fairy dimension during her coma, she was told to especially stay away from Bill (I think?)",,False,,t5_2r39t,1346104736.0,,,True,t3_ywtdo,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueBlood/comments/ywtdo/warlow_theories_spoilers/,

I have read the books, so I count myself among the many female pervs that were pretty darn excited for what might happen with this season. But on the whole, it has been mostly... underwhelming. There was so much potential! I used to look forward to new TB episodes but now I find myself bracing for cringe inducing dialogue usually reserved for  T rated fanfiction. I know, I know... he's all sweet and sensitive now. We get it. But it is SO OBVIOUS that he is supposed to be sweet and sensitive, that its like a spray of sickly sweet perfume straight in the eyes. We are left slightly aghast and nauseated in a synthetic cloud of fairy dust. I feel like I am watching a hallmark card commercial when Sookie/Eric come on screen. I know TB can do much better. Where is the equivalent to all the hot gravedirt scenes of yesteryear?! Bring back moments like the hotness infused dream sequences of season 2.

If we wanted to watch two people lounging in the woods gently caress each other whilst staring into each others eyes we would just watch Twilight.

I have to admit, I *did not* think Burrell was going suffer a Russell-esque death but my jaw dropped when his head was detached from his body. A little part of me wishes he could have stuck around for a little while longer so Eric could drain him but we don't always get what we wish for.

[- Terry.](http://imgur.com/9JXDCId)

I never hated Terry, I never loved him. Although I did like seeing him &amp; Arlene as a couple and the final moments of his life where Arlene was bawling got to me :( I didn't want him to die but after giving LaLa the key to his [Safety Deposit Box](http://i.imgur.com/gvPUHH7.jpg) *and then* being glamoured, I figured it was too good to be true. HBO does that. 

I kept thinking, so did his military buddy leave or..? Then he was walking joyfully to the dumpster and knew it was inevitable.

And finally, [Sookeh and her Precious Faery Vagina hard at work.](http://imgur.com/JfD80D1)

When she started blabbing about being a Danger Whore or whatever I was wondering where it was going... I would've *never* guessed that she would bone Warlow the Handsome! 

I thought they were going to have a heart-to-heart in Faery Land, she would possibly let him drink some of her blood and, at the most, cuddle. Yeah, I was wrong. When she took a bite out of him, I was done for the day.

",papa_seeps,92,16,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueBlood/comments/z1308/russell_edgington_spoilers/,"I know I'm not the only one but I'm really upset with the way they decided to kill off Russell. I understand the writers felt that he had run his course and they needed to do it but they could have made it much more intimate and satisfying than they had. Of course it should have been done by Eric, who had his parents taken from him over a 1000 years prior by this man. But there is no real exchange, no real emotion. Even if Eric had tackled Russell to the ground and stared into his eyes as he pushed the stake through, there would have been a mutual understanding there and a more emotional exchange.


What really bothers me about Russell's death is that the writers, in episodes 10 and 11, put him in such a great position to do more. He leaves the Authority with the brilliant idea of finding fairies and synthesizing their blood. He finds, after 3000 years, a fairy (and not just any) and drains her. I would have loved to see Russell cause some trouble in the daylight, even if it were only for a short time, and see how humans and the national media would react to that. It would have caused chaos and paranoia and would have further charged the human vs vampire conflict.


The way the writers went about his character really forced them into a corner, they were afraid of making him stale and a parody without realizing they could have made him a huge part of season 6.


tl;dr - Russell spotted killing in the daytime = huge drama on human vs vampire conflict in season 6.

It was bad enough, that one of our fellow Truebies decided to make her own [""Serious Episode Discussion""](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueBlood/comments/xdf4w/serious_episode_discussion_58_somebody_that_i/).

We mods talked it over and decided we can't have two separate discussions. It creates confusion. Then other people may start posting their own threads and blah, blah, blah.  Discussions should take place in the discussion thread, right? Well, that leads to the original problem. 

We love the quotes. It makes True Blood, *True Blood*. But we can't have that taking over the threads. Not pointing fingers or accusing anyone, but karma whoring tends to come into play. It degrades the quality of discussion. 

This Sunday, we'll be doing something new. We'll still have our weekly episode discussion thread along with a new **Favorite Quotes thread** that will go episode by episode. So, you quote lovers can have at it. As a bonus, we'll sticky them up at the top too. Fair? 

Another thing I wanted to remind you Truebies is that we have rules regarding spoilers. They're on the sidebar. They're not open to interpretation like a bible. Follow them. Because (spoilers ahead) [this shit don't fly here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueBlood/comments/xe55y/i_spit_my_drink_out_laughing_so_hard_favorite_pam/c5lv9xw?context=3)

The bottom line is and always will be: 
&gt; This subreddit is meant to be **a safe place** to read and talk about the TV series and books **regardless of how many episodes or books you have read.** 

And one more time... 

&gt; *regardless of how many episodes or books you have read.*


A couple of points: 

- People should be allowed to come to the front page of this subreddit **without seeing immediate spoilers**. That includes the thumbnail and title. 

- Be ambiguous with your titles.

- Put spoiler warnings in your titles. That way it won't be totally necessary to put up blackbars because, hey, you warned them, right? 

- If you're discussing the current season somewhere that's not the topic of the thread, cover up the spoilers. That includes future spoilers as well.

- Book spoilers must always be covered unless it's in the title that there are book spoilers. 

TL;DR: One discussion thread, One quotes thread. Watch your spoilers or get banned.

It's all about respect Truebies. Because spoilers suck.

Thanks for reading. Enjoy your day bloodbags! Tomorrow is our night.

I generally find it difficult to take anything about this show seriously, but how fucking depressing is this scene?


**Sookie Stackhouse:** Who would we be if we were normal? It's hard to even picture it. Would we live in Gran's house or your house?

**Bill Compton:** Both. We'd be married, happily married.

**Sookie Stackhouse:** And I'm not a waitress anymore. I'm... I'm going to college. No, I'm a real estate agent, and I'm really rich.

**Bill Compton:** I teach third grade and I love my job.

**Sookie Stackhouse:** We'll have a big flower garden.

**Bill Compton:** We grow vegetables.

**Sookie Stackhouse:** Tara comes over for dinner and sometimes we double date with Arlene and Terry.

**Bill Compton:** And I go fishing with Jason.

**Sookie Stackhouse:** We don't even know Eric Northman.

**Bill Compton:** Everything is peaceful.


After we realized that we were like fire and gasoline for each other, my first love and I concocted a similar ""in another life where we're not damaged addicts, instead we're together and happy"" scenario. So, maybe it's not really an emotional scene for everyone else. But holy shit, the tears caught me off guard!

-Russell has shown himself to be quite a rational and creative visionary.

In his ""outburst"" to the members of the Authority he explains the possibility of Day-walking and that it would be in every vampires best interest to study fairy blood; he even sites the fact that human blood was studied and synthesized (which of course we all know). This, to me at least, shows that he is thinking rationally.  He makes no mention of killing all fairies for his own greedy desires, he talks about getting blood and studying it.  Something that could (and should) easily be accomplished if logic was in play (which the writers won't allow).  

-Ironically enough, Russell's best partner in this movement would have been Roman.

Roman is all about co-existence and what better way to co-exist with humans than to be able to walk among them at any time?  It's interesting to think that if vampire's were able to live the lives they once had, in the sun, their lust for killing would probably subside.  I think it would have been very interesting to see Roman and Russell partner up for the greater good (though it wouldn't make for as dramatic television, I understand).  Russell's imagine is that of terror, but Roman's was one both humans and vampires could trust... he would certainly have been able to sway the public and get the ball in motion for synthesizing fae blood... he probably would have even been able to get some free samples from Sookie. It would have been interesting to see a civil war between vampire's start that way.  Sanguinista's, vampire's so blinded (no pun intended) that they cannot see any way to live outside of the dark vs vampire's who wish for a normal life again.  And then of course you'd have those who use fae blood for evil and can scheme ways to attack humans in the daytime.



tl;dr - Russell is a rational genius (for now), synthesizing fae blood would be interesting, he shouldn't have killed Roman. Writers are dumb.",,False,,t5_2r39t,False,,,True,t3_y7bu6,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueBlood/comments/y7bu6/russell_daywalking_and_voice_of_reason_for_modern/,

* The vampire curfew, prison, and True Blood poisoning are all because of Bill's idea last season to destroy all of the True Blood factories. No one has ever brought this up or held him accountable for turning into such an ass hole with the Authority last season before flipping back to his ""normal"" personality this season.

* Speaking of the Authority, one thing that bugged me is that we haven't seen much of the affects of the Authority being exposed and dissolved. What happened to the dozens of vampire soldiers? Are there still Kings, Queens, and other outside officers acting as if the Authority is still in power? What is the rest of the country and world doing about completely ungoverned and hungry vampires? 

* Luna shifted and died on television. We saw it replayed on the news at Sam's bar, but still don't really know what the public knowledge and consensus is about the existence of shifters and the vampire Authority.

* It's pretty sad and unbelievable that Sam is in love with another girl literally days after Luna's death.

I will say I have not read the books more than a bit of the first and second books, because they are awfully written, but love the show. I watch the show with two of my friends, and last night after watching episode 9 of the fourth season, one of those friends and I talked about this question.

Personally, I see Sookie's storyline to be kind of superimposed on the rest of it now. She's grown very boring, and they seem to be resulting to a bunch of unnecessary sex and nudity to make up for it. I mean, I love the Eric storyline, but can't stand Sookie's involvement at all.

For one, the Alcide/Debbie situation is much more interesting, because Alcide is a badass, and I feel like I can relate to him.(Haha) The way he deals with situations like Tommy getting a beat down, and what seems to be his grooming to becoming the alpha of the Schreveport pack is so much better than Sookie nude.

Sam/Tommy's intersecting story with Alcide and the Schreveport pack is also better in my opinion. I haven't really begun to think about what really led to Tommy to stick his neck out like that. He goes from hating Sam to doing stuff to help him every chance he gets. It seemed like he was going after suicide, but he wasn't really writing a suicide note in the bar, it was more like a ""I'm leaving, goodbye"" note by the sounds of it. And the way Sam is getting entangled with the whole Marcus/Luna thing is pretty nail-biting.

Lafayette and Jesus are also worth mentioning, though, I won't go into detail for sake of brevity's sake.

Anyway, I'm just wondering if anyone else would just prefer not to see the little tidbits of Sookie always getting hot and bothered with Eric or Bill, and more of the unraveling/intertwining story between other characters? It really is getting kind of old.

I ask because I found this last season to be the most interesting of all.

SPOILERS&gt;&gt;&gt;

I'm not terribly interested in reading the books, as I tried and couldn't get into them. The show has changed quite a bit since its inception, but I found this season to be the most fascinating. I had been wanting to find out about the upper ranks of the Authority, but was slightly disappointed to see that the tiers didn't go up very high, and that Eric and Bill were able to get in so easily, when Nora had been working forever to get to her position. 

Seeing Russell die was sad. I liked him, I saw someone's flair said ""Russell deserved better."" I agree, I thought there'd be more of a fight or at least ONE more faerie would die. 

I thought Bill was hatching a secret plan, and his initial ""go with Lillith"" strategy was a matter of ""keep our asses alive,"" until he drank the blood and exhibited that nesting behavior Pam talks about. Clearly he'd lost his shit when he became Billith, but if you think about it, every single one of the chancellors of the authority (except for Steve Newlin and our protagonists) are dead now. The threat for all-out war is theoretically moot now, since there are no more sanguinistas that we know of and there is no more authority. Who will rule? Maybe all-out war IS possible, I think it's interesting that we got to meet that General and hear his threats, because I don't think he was bluffing. Why wouldn't the government develop anti-vampire weapons just in case? It's the same as countries holding nukes nowadays, as fucked up as that is.

Anyway, so lastly, Warlow. The little snippet from next season at the end of the last episode shows Nora knowing something about him. We never got anything interesting from the elder faerie. All I hope for is that we don't spend the entirety of next season building up to Warlow's appearance. I hope he appears fairly early on and we get to deal with the aftermath, because I think they've already spent enough time building him up and his mystery.

That's all I got for now, feel free to post your theories in reply!

Lots of people talking about their dislike for season 4 (and many about season 5).

Then I checked the ratings again. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Blood#U.S._Nielsen_ratings) 

The ratings were pretty damn great for seasons 4 and 5. Still the best for HBO. Still beating down Game of Thrones (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones#Viewer_numbers)

I think the S6 premier may attract 5 million again.

I think I can say that the silent majority is still happy with the show.

Yes, of course, there were things I didn't like. The Authority plot wasn't great: Meloni was killed off quickly, and the whole Lilith thing wasn't very exciting.

That being said, I think the show is still great. It still has some of the best cliffhanger episodes on tv, and I'm really looking forward to what season 6 has to offer. 

I've been watching since the beginning. The show has tremendously improved/changed.

People talk about how the show ""isn't the same anymore"". But if it was the same format, then people would bitch that ""it never changes"". 

I'm glad that the story has progressed. I'm glad that they change things up. Some of the changes I like, others might dislike (and vice-verse).

The show is unique: it's funny; intentionally campy; it can be very romantic/sad when it needs to; and what I love is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.

Yes, it has changed a lot. Yes, there were a few things I really hated. But I still have high hopes for the show. ",,False,,t5_2r39t,False,,,True,t3_1c94vj,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueBlood/comments/1c94vj/although_many_people_dislike_the_shows_later/,

What with Lilith being the first vampire, it's safe to say that no other vampire created after her (which would undoubtedly be related to her) could ever display or possess the same level of abilities that we know she had cos of what Bill can do in this season.

1376416291.0,39,self.TrueBlood,1kai6v,"[Spoilers S6 Ep 7, 8, 9]My Thoughts on the Funeral and Why It Was Necessary",Slevo,52,13,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueBlood/comments/1kai6v/spoilers_s6_ep_7_8_9my_thoughts_on_the_funeral/,"So I’ve been seeing a lot of people complaining about the funeral in the last episode, saying stuff like “who cares about Terry?” and “the funeral went on way to long” and things like that. Well, here's what I thought (warning: wall of text)

Disregarding whether or not you liked Terry’s character (I personally did) I think that the funeral was meant to be a kind of turning point for the show, not just character wise, but theme-wise as well.

First, a little context. When I started watching True Blood, I absolutely loved it because it was basically a B-movie that was so incredibly over-the-top that it was almost a parody of the shitty preteen girl’s wet dream vampire stories that were being spewed out at the time (looking at you Twilight, it might have been even spoofing the books it was based on). The end of season 3, however, started to shift from the pulp which made the show so entertaining to focusing on character development (and not particularly well-written character development IMO). This shift came to a head in season 4 (IMO the worst season) and this shift, combined with lackluster writing and painfully hollow “emotions” from the characters made the show into something weirdly different to me and I almost stopped watching. Season 5 started to realize this and I think the whole Bill going nest crazy kind of reflected what the show realized it had turned into. Now in this season, I truly believe it is getting back to its awesome pulpiness (castrating doctors HEY-OH).

Now on to the funeral. I did think that the whole episode was a little weirdly-paced, switching between the solemnness of the funeral and the hilarity of Eric and Bill going to town in vamp camp. But I think that the funeral itself was meant to symbolize the return to classic True Blood form. Terry was a character that you only really got to know in the 4th-5th seasons, and you really just dove into his PTSD and what caused it. He was probably the only character that had JUSTIFIABLE character development, but IMO it wasn’t really done that well (that ifrite or whatever? C’mon). So I think that by using an entire episode to say goodbye, they were basically saying that they are done with the unnecessary character development and done trying to take themselves too seriously (which I think is shown by Arlene telling Big John his song was the shiiiiit). 

Obviously I know nothing for sure, but I really hope that the funeral represented a departure from seriousness and a return to the over-the-top gore, sex and southern soap opera drama that made the show so incredibly fun to begin with. Here’s hoping!

Tl;dr – Terry’s funeral represented a shift from the crappy seriousness of season 4 back to the over-the-top pulpiness that made True Blood such a fun show to begin with.

Six years.

Other than reminding me how old I'm getting, I started to think about how many more seasons the show will last.

The ratings are good and have been flat for a few years (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_blood#U.S._Nielsen_ratings). 

So even if they decline a bit, they show's ratings will still be acceptable for HBO.

I'd say there is a high probability the show will get renewed for a 7th season. 

Do you think it'll get to an 8th season?

No disrespect to the supporting cast, but honestly, the only two actors needed for the show are Anna Paquin and Skarsgard. (Shit, I'm sure the show would get decent ratings with just Skarsgard.) 

And I believe the two will stay on. (http://www.tvguide.com/PhotoGallery/TV-Highest-Paid-Stars-1052226/1052296)

With 10 episodes per season now, I think the show will benefit by having to focus on the main plot more, and less on the side plots.

With regards to quality, I think they can rebound. Dexter S7 was amazing compared to S6. I believe True Blood can rebound as well (not saying S5 was the worst season). (And Dexter got a final S8)

Niall has a half-fae son called Fintan, who has a son called Corbett. Also in the books Claude&amp;Co are Niall's grandchildren but this is not true in the books. The rest of this post will deal with what the show says. ANYWAY...

A lot of articles and even the Wikia once incorrectly stated Niall is Sookie's great-grandfather. What Niall actually said was ""I'm your fucking fairy grandfather"". I think an important distinction is to be made between normal grandfathers (e.g. Earl) and a fairy grandfather (Niall).

Let's look at the Stackhouses:

* Niall said his son John William Stackhouse signed the Warlow contract in 1702. 

* Jonas Stackhouse, born in 1801, moved to and built the Stackhouse home in 1834. He died in the 1870s.

* Earl Stackhouse died in 2009. He was probably born around 1930s.

Assuming human lifespans, this suggests: Niall &gt; John William &gt; X &gt; Jonas &gt; X &gt; Earl &gt; Corbett &gt; Sookie/Jason. It is possible John William was a hybrid like Sookie and maybe showed extended lifespan, so his son could be Jonas. I don't think we know about human-fae hybrid lifespans yet. I am also assuming Sookie is a direct descendant of John William as the contract, if I remember correctly, specified a Stackhouse. If Niall has other sons, I don't think they all would have taken the Stackhouse name as Niall's last name is Brigant. 

In this bloodline, were any of the sons hybrids?:

* Earl showed telepathy but we did not see any light powers. However, Earl was admitted into Queen Mab's realm which harvested hybrids, but Jason was not. This suggests Earl actually has the activated fae gene but probably hasn't had any help activating his light powers. Telepathy seems basic as Sookie could do it as a child. So Earl is a hybrid.

* No idea about Jonas or John William. John William was described by the Faerie Elder as ""handsome"", similar to how Jason is handsome thanks to his Fae blood but he has no light powers. However, I think everyone with fae blood is suppose to be attractive, so really we have no idea about John William or Jonas. I would have thought John William is not a hybrid because he no longer used the Brigant name and signed the Warlow contract. All hybrids have faerie godparents (e.g. Claudine to Sookie) so it might be that John William was simply in the loop about fae (like Jason is). However it is, of course, possible that John William simply did not want to die but was a hybrid. No idea about these two!

So why is Niall called a fairy grandfather?:

* Perhaps Sookie's fairy father is Earl, who showed fairy powers too. The next one in the bloodline could be Niall (if Jonas and John do not show fae powers), which would make Niall her faery grandfather.

* If John William was a hybrid, then Niall would be Sookie's fairy great grandfather.

* Or the shows just doesn't bother calling Niall her great-great-great-great-great grandfather, and just keeps one ""great"". It's just *titles* and this isn't paid much attention to in the show.

Is Sookie half-fae or what?:

* Interestingly, in a Season 5 episode (""In the Beginning""), Claude&amp;Co tell Sookie she is half-fae so her powers are finite. However, in S6E2 Niall says ""part fae"" and it is clear Sookie cannot be half-fae.

* Following the bloodline and assuming one parent is fully human AND assuming human-like lifespans, we have:

&gt; Niall 100%

&gt; John William 50%

&gt; X 25%

&gt; Jonas 12.5%

&gt; X 6.25% 

&gt; Earl 3.125%

&gt; Corbett 1.5625%

&gt; Sookie 0.78125%

So it seems Sookie is between 0.78125% and 1.5625% fae (if the first X is present or not present). If the fae gene acts differently (due to magic!), this might be different. For example, it might remain the same if the child is like Jason who doesn't show powers. If lifespans are not human, then we can cut out the two Xs. Sookie would be 3.125% fae. Not that much better!

I really wish this show would make relationships a bit clearer as they are deviating from the books. Perhaps they are not making things clear as it allows them to randomly throw in new characters (e.g. ""some Stackhouse signed a contract!"" = new storyline).

Thoughts? (Yeah I have a lot of free time on my hands...)

We are introduced to an overweight hillbilly in a silk robe and we, as viewers, are supposed to buy in to her being a real villain? she's certainly crazy but she is appears to be no threat and is, appearance-wise, comical. 

how are viewers supposed to get an idea of how committed she is, how strong her beliefs are and how exciting of a villain she can be when we no essentially nothing about her and her only screen time is ridiculous? 

Could they have not made this so much better by having Sheriff Deerborne, tired of the stress and crime in his town, and now knowing that so many of the tragedies he could never figure out were caused by supernaturals, wanting to take the law into his own hands and starting a group with other lawmen instead of a handful of delinquent hicks to bring down supernaturals? 

They could have used his years of experience, contacts, and intelligence to create a legitimate and reasonable threat to the vampire's (and other supernaturals) who are mostly glorified for their savage ways.

Don't think she's some all powerful vampire god.

We all know vampires gain various powers as they get older.

I think she's just an incredibly old vampire, and once a vampire is old enough, they gain some kind of ability to enter another dimension or afterlife when they die.

Lilith is part of a collective of great vampires or Lilith IS the collective, trapped in some kind of afterlife and they're all searching for a vessel to rejoin the world. That vessel being Bill who opened himself up to being said vessel by drinking Lilith's blood. Which would explain what we saw at the end of the episode - other great vampires joining Lilith.

This would explain why Lilith appeared to anyone who drank her blood. She was tempting EVERYONE to drink her blood and welcome her into them.

I think Warlow is part of this collective, which explains his apparition in Sookie's bathroom and his seemingly changing appearance(he was some guy with long, dark hair and a beard when we first saw him, and is now apparently an older gentleman). I'm going to go out on a limb and say that either Sookie is his next vessel, or that he is going to want her to birth him a new vessel.

I'm guessing that Bill is about to become an amalgam of personalities, fighting for control.

[There's even mention in folklore and mythology of Lilith being part of a group of female demons.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith) Perhaps Lilith isn't even a vampire, but part of some kind of transdimensional group of demons.

I've watched all of the seasons again and the question hasn't really been answered. I've only read two of the books and so far it hasn't been addressed there either.

Okay so we all know that when a human drinks a vampire's blood, that vampire is then connected to them right? (I wonder how deep the connection is then?) 

When people sell and drink V, how hard would it be to find the people who are drinking it, therefore finding the distributors and eradicating the V drug business? 

What I'm trying to say is that when people drink V, does that mean that they too are connected to the vampire that the blood belongs to?

Or does it not count because magically the blood needs to come directly from the vampires body?

I thought at first that it had to be a lot of blood that a human needs to drink to be connected, but in season 2 Eric tricks Sookie into drinking her blood and she says something like,

""But I only drank a little, I spat out most of it!""

Then Bill replies, ""It only takes a little, a drop or two.""

..which is how much V someone needs to get high.

* It's a mystery show with no mysteries anymore.
* As in many other shows, the jump forward seems to have been used to jettison all consistent characterization. Jump forwards should henceforth be called ""we want to write a different show, but we're not sure how.""
* I'm sick of shows that spend an entire season to build up a sweet romance (Jessica and Hoyt), only to skip the entire relationship afterward and jump to them breaking up.
* I'm sick of everyone turning into puppy dogs over Sooky and her magical fairy vagina. It's especially disgusting when someone like Eric abandons all previous characterization and jumps down the throat of Pam. It sickened me. The only possible explanation I could embrace for this behavior is that Sookie's blood is a roofie to vampires in the way their blood is a roofie to everyone else.
* Don't get me started on the absurd way that Eric acted like a toddler when he lost his memory. I felt queasy watching Sookie having sex with a toddler.
* Sookie's power in the book was distinct and limited. She could read minds, but it wasn't like reading a book. She had to catch people thinking about something. Her mind reading almost completely disappeared this season. They've ignored her book power, which is awesome, but limited, and they've replaced it with a deus ex machina fairy power that seems to do whatever the plot needs to advance.",,False,,t5_2r39t,False,,,True,t3_nugab,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueBlood/comments/nugab/i_know_this_has_been_stated_before_but_is_anyone/,

The ipad game was plants vs zombies, and of course Pam's appearance elicited a few zombie comments.  Can Antonia raise the human dead as well as the vampiric dead?  Will she try to raise a zombie army next?

* Maxine Fortenberry, Super Christian.  Has a hose in her hand, watches he neighbor burn up.  ""I knew it!""  Water wasn't going to save her, but Maxine didn't even think about trying.

* I understand that silver has to be touching skin for the vampires to be weakened.  When Bill was being held prisoner in that mansion, there was a set of silver doors keeping him from escaping.  Would something like that have been a good safeguard for the resurrection?  

* In the pilot, it was a very thin chain keeping Bill captive while they drained him.  Was this resurrection spell so powerful that it was stronger than Bill's will to live was (in the first episode)?  (Edit: He was faking it, they covered it in the season 3 finale.  My bad.)

* All we got out of the Mexico trip was knowledge that Lafayette is a medium.  Are we down to just Hoyt and Jason as non-specials?  This is a very gifted town.  

* Wow.  Alcede and Debbie sure found Sookie fast.  Must be some tiny woods round those parts.  Everyone in (human) walking distance of each other.

* Why did Bill keep reiterating the witches plans?  We're not idiots, it was a week ago when we heard about them last.  We remember.  

* That sequence with the witch torture and burning must have been expensive, because they seem to pull it out every chance they get.

* The attempted abortion spell either cursed the baby or welcomed an evil spirit -- the spirit is angry at Arlene for wanting to kill the baby.
* The baby has witch/medium powers.
* Did the ghost live in the house where Hoyt/Jessica are or was it just attached to the doll and moved accordingly?
* The ghost was speaking creole/French, which is the fake accent that Rene used (I was told that the fact she was speaking this language means it's not likely she's the ghost of a slave).

3) solar lasers.  Just a big ass gun that shoots UV rays... then again they could have hand-held rifles...but whatever, it's fun to say ""big ass gun""

We mods have noticed (and received a few complaints) about spoilers not being tagged properly.

It is written in the sidebar how to properly tag posts as spoilers, so there is no reason for people not to be doing it. We mods tag them as we see them, but we can't be online all hours of the day to monitor every single comment/post that contains spoilers.

If you see one, please report it immediately and message us mods **with a link to the post/comment**. There's no point in messaging us describing the post or comment, sometimes there is hundreds and it takes forever to find it.

A lot of people seem to think that because an episode is a few days old it doesn't matter what you say. But you need to understand that not everyone can watch it live as it airs, some (like me) need to be pirates. Some wait until the season is over and watch it all then. Even some people miss the episode and catch the next one whenever it airs. You all need to be mindful and courteous enough to understand this, and please mark your spoilers.

It's just like reading the books, some are fast readers, some are slow readers. For the sake of them, you need to respect that.

**That being said, if you come here when you are not entirely caught up on everything you should at least expect some spoilers.**

We mods have all agreed that following this post, **anyone who posts a spoiler and does not mark it will be banned immediately**. There is no excuse for spoiling something for anyone.

I would also like to touch up on another rule. **It is not okay to share/ask for any personal information** not just on this subreddit but the whole of reddit in general. Take that conversation up in PMs. You can say what you like there.

Thank you for reading and thank you for understanding, from all the mods.

Why?

It'll show character great progression for Sookie, maybe showing that she's not as selfish as we all see her to be. It'll also make her into a normal human being. This would take a huge load off her shoulders as the vampire magnet she was all series long.

Also, this would either conclude or spark up the relationship between Bill and Sookie. 

Obviously, the Sookie and Ben relationship won't last once she finds out what happened to her fairy grandfather Niall, so that relationship is bound to not work

However, according to this article, http://io9.com/warlow-explains-how-his-sex-powers-will-change-true-blo-978582904 the actor for Ben says his character can have kids. Don't think Sookie knows this, but she may just be pregnant!

Some things we learn from the preview: 

-Jason of course hasn't been hurt too badly by Russell since we see him going commando. And at one point, he's been gagged (0:13).

- At 0:10, we see Tara seemingly in the Authority's elevator with a gun in her hand. 

Probably a rescue/commando mission that involves: Eric, Nora, Tara, and Jason.

-At the 0:09 second mark, we see a vamp in chains. Who is that?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Moving on. My predictions:

LaFayette, Terrry, Holly, and Arlene won't (and shouldn't) be too too major a factor (screentime) in this episode.

Sam, Luna, Jessica, and Pam are going to be helped by the rescue/commando mission. I think Sam and Luna will Emma back. Luna and Nora may be killed off.

The southern Sharon Osborne vamp should be killed off without too much of a fuss.

I think vamps and humans (The US military) will get to the brink of war, but then things will cool down again. 

A few episodes ago, I thought Bill was faking. Now it seems he's truly insane. I think at the end, he might come to his senses. Be ashamed of what he's done, then exile himself.

Salome will die. I don't know by who's hand, but it'll happen. 

I think the Lilith and Warlow story's will connect. Maybe they're the same person/thing? IDK. 

Russell and Steve Newlin will be killed off, I think. The show needs to resolve their storylines. And I doubt the producers will want Russell back for another season (though Denis O'Hare does a great job portraying him). Andy might save the day, due to the pact w/his babyFairyMama.

I don't know what's going to happen to Sookie in the episode (and am not very interested) but I think she'll ""meet"" Warlow right before they cut to the credits. 

Oh, and Alcide and the werewolves will do...something. Don't really care about that. 

And according to IMDB, Hoyt's going to be back: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2187556/fullcredits#cast
