**Care to share some pictures? Do you have before and after pictures?**

I don’t have digitized pictures of me when I was overweight, but [here](http://imgur.com/a/vNj3y) are my latest pics.

**What are your current stats? (Age, sex, height, weight, body fat % method used)**

I’m 35 and a half, 5’6”, 166.4 lbs and around 8% BF (measured with calipers, Jackson-Pollock 7 point method and visual comparisons).

**What is your story? What sports or athletic activities are you involved in, and when, how, and why did you get into it?**

I have always struggled with my weight. 

I used to be an overweight kid, I think I got to around 120 lbs when I was about 12 (keep in mind that I’m very short). I remember not being able to run, and hating all outdoor physical activities. 

During school, I was your typical nerd: overweight, I spent all my time playing videogames, reading comic books, etc. Then puberty hit, and you know, girls started to become important, so I decided to start lifting. 

I bought a couple of magazines, started doing some exercise, and had some progress, went from being overweight to just chubby. I tried to follow the traditional ""bulk up"" diets (lots of carbs, etc.) but probably did everything wrong because I only got fatter and didn't really build muscle. 

Sometime around 2001 I was reading on some forums on the internet and found out about a “Ketogenic Diet”, In which you could get big with little body fat gain, so I looked around some more and decided to buy a couple of books: 

* [BodyOpus by Dan Duchaine](http://www.amazon.com/Underground-Bodyopus-Militant-WeightRecomposition/dp/0965310701)

* [The Ketogenic Diet by Lyle McDonald](http://www.amazon.com/Ketogenic-Diet-Complete-DieterPractitioner/dp/0967145600/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367373336&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lyle+mcdonald+ketogenic)

So I started following the diet and training set up by the books, with some slight experimenting along the way, and here I am, almost twelve years later, talking with the beloved community of /r/ketogains

**How do you deal with naysayers and clashes between your lifestyle and those around you?**

*Live and let live.* If you want to be educated, I will help you. If not, let me be.

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

If there is anything I have learned from keto, Is to be open to new theories. I try to take all advice and study it to see if its logical or feasible, or if it has credible sources.

**How do you motivate yourself? (music, quote, etc.)**

“Do, or do not. There is no Try.” – Master Yoda.

Also, I never go to the gym without my ipod. I love music, any kind. I have a big collection ranging from Jazz, House, Classic Rock, Heavy Metal, Bubble Gum Pop and right now I’m on my Indie Phase.


**What are your favorite sports/fitness books, DVDs, websites, or other resources?**

My favorite book is “Arnold’s The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding”. 

Also, I used to buy Muscle &amp; Fitness magazine every month, to get new routines and training tips.

**Do you have a role model / inspiration, or anyone you would like to train with, or compete against, who would it be and why?**

""The Oak"" (Arnold) - Period. Do you even have to ask why?

***DIET AND NUTRITION***

**How did you end up doing a Ketogenic diet?**

I've answered it in “What is your story"" ;)

**Do follow a SKD TKD, CKD? Why?**

I've followed all three: Back when I started keto, I did a CKD with mixed results. The more I did it, the better results I got, but also I found it hard due to the depletion workouts and meal preparing. Then about 2 years ago I started experimenting with TKD and now I do a mix between it and a SKD.

**What does your diet look like?**

I’m a very boring guy, diet wise. 

In lieu of not complicating myself, I’ll eat always the same things, that way I know exactly what I’m getting: Eggs and ham, cheese, chicken, tuna, salmon, beef, salads, veggies, etc.

**Do you take any supplements? Which ones, and how do they help you achieve your goals?**

- *Preworkout*: VPX Creatine Plasma, VPX Shotgun, Jack3d Micro – to get energy and focus for my lifts

- *Postworkout*: Whey protein shakes , Glutamine, BCAA’s, Green tea pills – to repair and build muscle

**What are some diet / training related things you hold to be true, but cannot prove?**
It used to be the Ketogenic diet, but since I found out about /r/keto and was invited to mod /r/ketogains, I've found a wealth of information and backups to the diet’s claims.

***TRAINING***



**Do you compete at any level?**

Only against myself!


**What is your workout or training regimen?**

I follow a 5 day split with 1 or 2 days rest. ^[Sample ^shoulder ^and ^ab ^workouts ^can ^be ^found ^in ^darthluiggi's ^post ^history. ^-Ed.]

**What is your training philosophy?**

Just go and do it. Get in, lift hard, get out.

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training that you've never seen others do?**

I suppose it’s nothing new, but people look me weird because I incorporate bodyweight exercises in my training (pistols, levers, etc.)

**Any other little innovations you don't mind sharing?**

I like to mix and match training styles, sometimes I’ll start with doing very heavy sets and then go all pyramid style, just to see how hard / long my muscles can take it.

**What injuries have you had to deal with? What are the injury risks that come with your athletic endeavors? Any advice on how to deal with these injuries and risks?**

I've had my share of shoulder / arm injuries due to not warming up correctly. Guys, warm up sets are a real thing.

***GOALS***

**What are your current athletic or fitness-related goals?**

I’d like to hit +167 lbs while maintaining my current BF% sometime next year.

**What have you achieved so far? (Body re-composition, times, weights, etc.)**

I managed to drop my body fat % from 12, then to 10 and now a little over 8 in the last two years, while keeping up with my lifts and increasing muscle size.

**What challenges do you face?**

Trying to balance my macros as to eat enough to sustain muscle and lifts, and maintain my current BF %

***OFF-TOPIC***

**What do you do? (For fun, work, or anything else you feel like sharing)**

My hobbies range from playing video-games, to collecting and customizing G.I. Joe figures, to lifting. I'm still a nerd.

**You get one superpower, which one is it and why?**

Stop Time. Really, sometimes I just don’t have enough.

**If your biography became an audiobook, who would you want to narrate?**

Arnold! Something along like [this.](http://youtu.be/hlxoyw_8I7I)


**FOLLOW UPS**

**Do you train alone, or with a partner or group? Is it because of scheduling? Preference? Or a combination of factors?**

I train alone, mainly because of schedule, but also because people that have trained with me find it hard to keep up. 

**I imagine that this question answers itself, but: The Oak, training partner? Or fellow competitor.**

Arnold as a training partner and mentor. I’m not worthy!

**If you could spend a day with anyone, living or dead, fictional or historical, who would it be, and why?**

Again, Arnold! A perfect day would be Arnold in his “Pumping Iron” Days, training, joking and having an epic meal post workout!


**You've said you only compete against yourself, but if you were going to compete bodybuilding, fitness/physique or similar seems like a natural choice for you. Would you agree, or surprise us by choosing another category for yourself?**

I agree, I guess I would fit in the natural fitness category.

**You certainly seem to have competitive potential, is it something you've ever considered?**

I’ve pondered about it, and some people have asked me about doing it… I don’t know …maybe???

**If you don't mind us asking, what do you do for a living?**

I manage a restaurant, from marketing, back office, doing PR, waiting tables, designing the menu, a little bit of everything. Training keeps me sane and helps me burn the stress out!

Hey all,

Seems like new member activity is alive and well here at /r/ketogains which is great. I welcome all of you here. It's a great place to discuss and have your questions answered. Thanks to very active members like /u/darthluiggi /r/ketomnemonic and the rest of you ketogainers, this SR is going strong. So let's thank them for all of their work.

Now, let's help these guys out. It seems like they are spending an inordinate amount of time answering the same questions. so i wrote up this little ditty to help them as well as you.

* These guys are spending way too much time looking at pictures of topless dudes. We want to help, but there are several links in the sidebar about visually estimating body fat. Consult there first, please. Using those photos in the sidebar, you'll be about as accurate as the experts here.

* And while you're there, read the FAQ - it's just plain lazy to ask questions that have been answered here before. when you make a new post, it makes you swear **""I have actually read the FAQ""**. Many of you haven't. Read it. Contribute to it.

* Tell us your STATS. A 5'3"" woman has different needs than a 6'4 linebacker. tell us about yourself.

* Tell us your GOALS. Are you eating too much? Too little? It all depends on what your goals are. 

* if you are a noob, don't overthink your Keto plan. Stick to SKD. if you are the point in your progress where you have to tinker with advanced topics, chances are, you don't need to ask.

* THE SCALE IS A TERRIBLE MEASURE OF PROGRESS. 

* ONCE AGAIN: THE SCALE IS A TERRIBLE MEASURE OF PROGRESS. Weight is nothing more than your mass in a specific gravity. Stop looking at the scale and look at your own body. Are you happy with it? That's a decision you have to make for yourself. Try not to doubt the process too much - it works for the vast majority of people. 

* Three days is not a stall or a plateau, three weeks is.

* **SAY THANK YOU. This is self-explanatory**

The members are under no obligation to help anyone. If you make it easier on those that are helping, then you are much more likely to get help. Help them help you.

* maintain under 20g carbs a day
* on rest (non-workout) days, eat 0.8-1.0g of protein per pound of lean body weight
* on workout days, eat 1.0-1.2g of protein per pound of lean
* rest of your calories should come from fat
* see ketogains macro calculator (http://bit.ly/1aNK7zp) for more details
* for ketogains, the most important macro is **your protein intake**. not enough protein - no amino acids for muscle building, or worse, muscle atrophy for your body's protein needs.

**Workout**

* SL5x5, Starting Strength, and my personal routine: Texas Method are all good places to start
* www.strengthcalc.com to find a routine for you
* Exercises should be high-intensity. If you can do more than 12 reps, you need to go heavier
* If lifting is not your sport, then do something challenging and anaerobic like:

&gt; sprinting

&gt; circuit-training / CrossFit

&gt; amateur wrestling

&gt; muay thai

**Carbs?**

* Are you working out as described in Section 2? If so, read this: http://imgur.com/H5HY685

So, my wife and I went on our first (long overdue) trip to Vegas as a married couple and, since we are both in good shape, we felt comfortable hanging out at a topless pool at one of the hotels on the Strip.

I am 46 and I had 20-something chicks looking my way secretly and smiling as well as guys in their mid-20s being shocked that I was 46 and asking how they could get in as good a shape as I am in.

So, having never been in good shape my entire life until now, its great to know its possible at 46 and be able to rock at the topless pool in Vegas.

1373491020.0,44,self.ketogains,1i19uy,why we promote heavy lifting over cardio or various other exercise programs for weight loss,semiotix,53,9,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1i19uy/why_we_promote_heavy_lifting_over_cardio_or/,"let's say you haven't been to the gym in a while, or ever. you're out of shape. you start p90x and start seeing results. good results, maybe even GREAT results.

why does this happen? 

well, **any** intense exercise program works if you were not on one before. it grows musculature in places you didn't have. it uses the energy you weren't using before and puts it into new muscle - a process that takes a lot of energy to repair and build.

but after a while, these highly-cardio-oriented workout plans stall, people return to their ""regular"" diets, and then they rebound. why?

well if you weren't exercising before, you're getting new muscle - even through simple walking and running. due to the newfound muscle in your body, it takes less effort and energy to repeat these same exercises. after lifting a 10lb weight 100 times, it becomes increasingly easier and easier to do so to a point where it becomes effortless.

but you are NOT building new muscle, and in fact, you are expending less energy to do so. this is why you stall. this is why cardio-heavy plans do not work long term!

sure, maybe you can run that 10k today. and maybe you can increase the distance you can run to 15 or 20k. but this is an effect of efficiency in terms of energy and cardiovascular use - your body learns to use its energy more sparingly. your energy expenditure becomes smaller - *you have to continue to run further and further to get the same benefts*. how will you lose weight if you are using less energy to do the same exercises?

which brings us back to why you should lift heavy:

there is no practical limit to the amount of muscle you can build. oh, you can deadlift 300 lbs? well, you can STILL lift 350, and when you get there, you can lift 400. that's a 33% increase in your limit with the potential to continue to grow. all the while, having more muscle mass means more energy expenditure (whereas fat doesn't need much extra energy to sag off your ass). lifting increasingly heavier means you cannot become more efficient because you are constantly pushing the limits of your body. *with heavy weight training, your energy expenditure only gets larger as you continue to train*.

if you want weight loss, get off the elliptical and lift heavy things. as those things get heavier, you will burn more energy, and there is (for all intents and purposes) no plateau to how much you can burn. stay keto and your body will stop storing fat as an energy source and begin to use it to fuel muscle growth.

simple as that.

lift hard. lift heavy. stop when you see the results you want.

you might even find that you want to continue getting bigger when you get there.

***""I'm lifting, and here are my macros, and I'm not losing weight or worse, gaining weight! What am I doing wrong?! How do I fix this!?""***

Now, I'm going to ask a rhetorical question.

 Why are you weighing yourself?

 The scale is a highly specialized tool, that does one thing and does it well. It tells how much total mass is resting on the weighing platform.

The scale can't tell you about the quality of the mass, where the mass is (aside from ""on the scale""), where the mass came from, how, or why.

Granted virtually every household and gym has one, but is it the appropriate tool for measuring your progress?

The answer is a resounding **sometimes**.

I'm willing to bet the disclosure of my throwaway account that the majority of us here in ketogains, especially those who are r/keto expats or ""dual citizens"" started our journey to fitness with one simple goal: Be less fat. I suspect though that most, if not all, of us phrased it as ""lose weight.""

Well, we're not in r/keto anymore. We don't celebrate frivolous ""Scale Victories"" here. It's time to think about goals on a new level.

 Are you a competitive athlete who needs to make weight for an event? The scale is your friend.

Are you trying to lose pounds (or kilos) so that you can safely skydive? The scale is your friend.

Are you trying to lose weight because your doctor has said ""You need to lose 20 pounds, your heart will thank you.""? The scale is your friend.

 Are you into bodybuilding? Not the step on stage in a thong and pose kind, but building your body into what you want it to be. The scale is an old acquaintance you catch up with every month or two, to see how things are going.

Are you just trying to get strong, and not get fat? Sell your scale, you have a mirror.

 It's time we stop treating the scale as the arbiter of progress. Here in ketogains it is a mere lesser member of our progress tracking pantheon. The loud younger brother of the mirror and of the improvements in your training. The lazy twin of the humble measuring tape. The lackluster parent of bodyfat analysis.

Set your goals with forethought, specificity, and deadlines. You have evolved beyond ""Get less fat."" The time is now to pick a physique you want to attain, find a feat you want to accomplish, select a sport at which you want to excel. Set your focus on that, and off the scale, and I promise you that even if you don't lose net mass the world will think you have.",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,False,,mod,True,t3_1ju6ov,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1ju6ov/rant_lifting_losing_scales_and_goals/,

Following my past workout posts:

* [Shoulder workout](http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1cpmsu/my_current_shoulder_workout_for_those_interested/)

* [Core/abdominal workout](http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1d6lpa/a_coreabdominal_workout_for_those_interested/)

I now will give you my current arm workout.

Again, as all my routines, it is tailored for maximum hypertrophy and exhaustion. Be warned, if you follow the workout to a T, you may end up feeling dizzy and weak, along with a cold sweat.

We will do all the exercises back to back, meaning that we start with exercise A, and instead of resting, you head off and do exercise B immediately. We alternate between biceps and triceps exercises, with some forearm in between used as support muscles. 

I work around 80% my one max rep, and incorporate pyramid / inverse pyramid training to reach exhaustion. Weight used is just indicative, adjust according to your possibilities.

Ready?

Here we go!

*Warmup / Starting set:* - repeat x3

* [""V"" Bar Cable Pressdown](http://www.mensfitness.com/sites/mensfitness.com/files/imgs/cablepressdown_inarticle_0.gif) - 12~15 reps at 60 lbs, then 8~10 reps at 40 lbs, then 8~10 reps at 30 lbs. Immediately go and pick up an Olympic Bar and do...

* [Olympic Bar Standing Curl](https://d3vs5ss8iow0ry.cloudfront.net/video-library/thumbnail/olympic-bar-front-wrist-curl_-_step_1.max.v1.png) - I do this without added weight, the bar by itself is 45 lbs. Here, we go for exhaustion: at least I aim for 25 reps Alternate between close grip and [open (supinated) grip](http://www.t-nation.com/img/photos/2011/11-665-02/strict-curl.jpg). Immediately after finishing, I go back to the ""V Cable Pressdown"" and repeat.

*Exercise Set 1*- repeat x3

* [Rope Cable Pressdown](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/54/Male/m/54_2.jpg) - the key here is to do the movement slowly, and squeeze the triceps at the tension point. Maintain contraction for 2-3 seconds. 12~15 reps at 50 lbs, then 8~10 reps at 35 lbs, then 8~10 reps at 20 lbs.

* [""Modified"" Z Bar Curl](http://www.hillsidefittube.com/video/modification-z-bar-curl) - Again, do the movements slowly, and concentrate specifically on the negative (when lowering the weight). I also alternate between close and open grips. First set 12 reps, 65 lbs, Second set, 10 reps, 90 lbs, Third set, 8-10 reps, 110 lbs. *Sometimes on the last set, I'll grab a 45lb Z bar and do curls until exhaustion to achive 'da pump.*

*Exercise Set 2*- repeat x3

* [Lying Triceps Press](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/lying-triceps-press) - First set 12 reps, 65 lbs, Second set, 10 reps, 90 lbs, Third set, 8-10 reps, 110 lbs.

* [Standing Concentration Curl](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/standing-concentration-curl) - First set 12 reps, 50 lbs, Second set, 10 reps, 55 lbs, Third set, 8-10 reps, 60 lbs.

*Exercise Set 3 - ""finisher""* repeat x3

* This exercise is 3 in 1 and *will kill you*, the 3 exercises are done back to back *without rest* One set *is the whole* circuit. Be warned:

1 - [Standing Supinated Curl](http://www.hillsidefittube.com/izle/tr-standing-supinated-dumbbell-curl) but holding my arms open [like this](http://www.hindu.com/mp/2009/10/31/images/2009103150260401.jpg) - First set 12 reps, 40 lbs, Second set, 10 reps, 45 lbs, Third set, 8-10 reps, 50 lbs. 

Immediately without rest, with the same weight, do:

2 - [Cross Body Hammer Curl](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/cross-body-hammer-curl) - First set 12 reps, 40 lbs, Second set, 10 reps, 45 lbs, Third set, 8-10 reps, 50 lbs.

Then do:

3 - [Standing Dumbbell Tricep Kickback](http://smalltownrevelations.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/triceps-kickback-without-bench-support.jpg) - I do these with both hands at the same time. First set 12 reps, 40 lbs, Second set, 10 reps, 45 lbs, Third set, 8-10 reps, 50 lbs.

Repeat.

Now you can go home and cry like a baby, but with your guns feeling like jelly. 

*Prepare for some nice DOMS afterwards.*

Optional for forearms:

By now your forearms should be pretty pumped up, specially after doing the ""finisher set"", but on my off days I also like the [Plate Pinch](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/plate-pinch) - try grasping two 25 lb plates with *one hand* and holding them as long as possible (20 seconds, for example).",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,1375283541.0,,cust iebro,True,t3_1jde7j,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1jde7j/my_current_arm_workout_for_those_interested/,

Here are some observations and ramblings. Take it as what you will.



**Supplements:**


Citruline Malate probably doesn't do anything except quench my thirst at the gym. Nice and sour!

Don't take coffee+heavy cream + beta alanine at the same time. It will probably mess up your stomach.

Beta alanine rocks. At first I didn't believe, but now I'm finally seeing gains from it after 2 months.
I thought Glutamine was BS. It seems to work for me very, very well. It not only helps my tummy, but also helps me ""gain"" muscle by preventing my body from eating my muscles.

But Glutamine is expensive. Damn.

Creatine doesn't seem to do much for me. When I was loading on it, I got very bloated and very... leaky. heuheuheuh. I didn't gain a single pound of water weight.

I still take Creatine.

Taurine is best at night. Stay away from beta alanine if taking taurine during the day.

Multivitamins are made of highlighter fluid.

ZMA works very very very well for me. Dosage is 3 pills before bed. I take 4. Fuck the police.

Gonna buy Potassium Chloride soon.



**Diet:**


SKD was fine for about a month until I started getting VERY weak before the gym. Tried coconut oil but it did nothing. I carbed up one night on Sunday and felt like an Ox in the morning.

I do a post workout dextrose load. Sometimes it makes me nauseous.

It's easy to not get enough fat. Make Fat Bombs.

Avocado is great but expensive. Well worth it.

Making bacon everyday gets the stove very messy.

I've lost 18 lbs doing SKD, and then gained another 6 after lifting.

Weight fluctuates a lot.

The white chocolate ON shake is a great alternative to the double chocolate flavor.

Be sure to get enough veggies. nothing but meat will tear you up.

Carb cravings still exist but I ignore them. Maybe I'll do a carb up soon.




**Workout related:**


Rest days are rest days. I can't seem to do any HIIT on rest days.

I feel fat still even though I feel somewhat stronger.

My calves actually have gotten bigger doing SS. Yes it can happen!

My bench press sucks. I had it almost fall on me once but some random dude saved my neck.

But my squat is getting deadly...

Do different types of squats on different days. Don't always go for max weight. FEEL the muscles being used. Do low weights, high reps on some days.

Don't use your knees while squatting. It will jack you up. Proper form is key.

I see people doing high weight squats and barely forming a 45 degree angle with their legs. I am superior.

Some women are strong as hell at my gym. 235 deadlifts from a chick 5'4""?

Deadlifts are my favorite exercise.

I try to deadlift my dog but I keep touching his wee wee. Gross.

Friggin power cleans are very tough. I still don't think I'm doing them right.

Knees get banged up from improper clean/deadlift form. Watch it.

Wholy crap my neck/shoulder muscles have gotten huge. I had nothing!

Also, my forearm muscles were non-existent before. Now...  I'm gaining.

Bicep muscles are not huge. SS don't give no shit about biceps.

Neck pains have subsided from lifting.

My moobs are starting to fill out.

I still get DOMS if I worked out properly.

ALWAYS, ALWAYS walk 5-10 minutes at 3.2mph after lifting. It helps so much with the DOMS.

Afternoon workouts are the best time energy-wise. Too bad the gym is a lot more packed.

I helped some young stick with his proper form at the gym. He's gonna make it.

My grip is a lot stronger. You know those guys that shake your hands too strong for no fucking reason? I will grip those assholes back until they cry.

Put the weights you're going to use right next to you if you're doing any sort of pyramid exercise. People take the 2.5 and 5lb weights all the time.

A Mouthguard is a very cheap investment and helped me gain on the deadlift and squat.

I see dude's bodies now (no homo) and can tell that a good half of them are focused solely on their arms.



**Random:**


I'm getting mired a lot more.

..And people pay attention to me more and stop bumping into me like jerks even though I'm a tall dude.

I'm kinda physically tired all the time still. I need a lot of sleep.

Nobody really supports me in my quest to get fit as fuck, but they sure are proud of me. (dafuq?)

I still drink a lot of alcohol. Vodka, Whiskey, and Gin.

My mood has somewhat stabilized.

Tanning a bit makes me look stronger.

First things first:

To get great visible abs, you will need a combination of low body fat, genetics and exercise.

To have somewhat visible abs, your body fat should be below 15%, but to get them really defined you will need to be a little below 12%.

Some people have [8 packs, some 6, and there are even some with 4.](http://athleanx.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/8-pack-vs-6-pack-abs.jpg)
This variation is genetic and there is really nothing you can do about it: the Rectus Abdominus is in reality just one big muscle, and it has seams that join it together giving it the impression of being individual muscles.

Now, for the training:

Contrary to popular belief, abs and core should be trained just like any other muscle of your body: 3-5 sets, 10-15 reps. 
Doing 500 reps will definitely build endurance, ~~but will not make them grow or make them more defined~~ (As /u/thebraken said, doing this will be more in the line of cardio and is not optimal for an ab workout).

I train abs directly once or twice a week, depending on how much time I have. Sometimes I'll add one or two exercises after my body part split, sometimes I just leave Saturday for cardio and abs. 

Also, every time you lift free weights, you will also indirectly use your abs. This is more noticeable when doing deadlifts, squats, even standing barbell curls or standing french presses.

The exercises:

* [Weighted leg lifts:](http://theshortsideofit.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lowab.jpg) Lay on a bench and grab a dumbbell between your ankles, lift your legs while contracting your abs, hold position, repeat: 3 sets, 15, 12, 10 reps 

* [Hanging leg raises:](http://www.fullfitness.net/sites/default/files/hanging_leg_raise.jpg?1248300877) - 3 sets, 15, 12, 10 reps or until failure

* Hanging leg circles: Similar to the hanging leg raise, but rotate legs in circles (all the way to the head and back down again moving in a circular motion)- 3 sets, 10 reps (do 5 reps clockwise and 5 reps counterclockwise)

* Front lever: grab a [narrow grip bar](http://cdn.scoobysworkshop.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/NarrowGripPullupUp.jpg) and place it on a bar, pull yourself [up and hold](http://www.beastskills.com/wp-content/uploads/manual/image/FrontLever34.jpg) for 30 seconds. Repeat x 3

* [Landmines (or Russian twists):](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/1751/Male/l/1751_2.jpg)
3 sets, 15, 12, 10 reps [Guide here](http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/landmine-180s)

* [Superman planks:](http://movemofitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Superman.jpg) Lift yourself and hold position for 30 seconds. Repeat x 3

* [Side planks:](http://photos.mensfitness.co.uk/images/library_UK_11/side_plank_5800_7.jpg) Lift yourself and hold position for 30 seconds. Repeat x 3

1373999762.0,29,self.ketogains,1ifhww,community round-table: let's get clear on losing fat,semiotix,38,9,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1ifhww/community_roundtable_lets_get_clear_on_losing_fat/,"i see that there are differing opinions on how to lose fat in this sub-reddit. all of us that are on ketogenic diets should know that nutrition science has clearly been wrong on their assumptions and have even called keto ""dangerous"" and ""life-threatening"". because of this, there are still lots of generally misunderstood notions about diets. let's try to get through these.

that said, i not only invite, but **encourage all of you to partake in the conversation**.

let's start with assumptions - these are the bases upon which the discussion will take place:

1) keto (reducing carbohydrates to a negligible dietary amount) causes weight loss in people - in both people who are already highly active and people who are sedentary (see /r/keto /r/ketogains)

2) it is scientific fat that insulin triggers responses in your body to both store more fat and to stop using fat as a source of energy (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin#Physiological_effects)

3) glycogen is the preferred energy source for the human body (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen), in which case, the human body will use glycogen before it taps into stored fat.

&gt; When present in sufficient quantities, glucose is the preferred fuel for most tissues in the body -- Lyle M
 
4) the human body stores up to approximately 500 grams of glycogen in the body (see: http://www.extension.iastate.edu/humansciences/content/carbohydrate)

what this foundation tells me are these several things:

* fat loss on keto is predominantly done through the use of stored energy through robbing the body of glycogen as its preferred energy source

* insulin, through eating carbs, tells your body to conserve energy, store body fat, and stop using fat as an energy. 

* then it is sufficient to say that the significant portion of fat loss comes from the lack of carbohydrates which leads to your body burning fat for its energy source.

* furthermore, if insulin tells you to store more energy and stop using fat, then it is sufficient to say that high-carb diet make you fatter faster.

what am i proposing? calories-in, calories-out is an oversimplified method of estimating or calculating fat loss. it is not as simple as CI,CO because it has been proven that different macronutrients (and hormones like insulin) have a different effect on your body. if that is the case, then we must simply reject the notion that counting calories and eating carbs is as efficient at weight-loss as rejecting carbohydrates - **assuming that caloric remains the same**

this is not to say calorie consumption doesn't effect your body mass. if you have excess energy, you WILL gain weight. but if you eat excess calories and a significant portion comes from carbohydrates, then your body **must expend the glycogen reserves used** before it will tap into stores energy deposits.

Yes, you can maintain weight through eating your BMR in pure, processed sugar, but this will make it hard to lose weight due to glycogen reserves stored in your body - because your energy expenditure must exceed 2000 STORED calories (see 4) in addition to what you are eating that day (another 1500-2000) to even scratch the surface of fat loss. if these muscle glycogen reserves are NOT depleted, then every extra calorie gets converted into stored fat. *In addition: insulin is signaling your body to store more fat and burn less of it!*

The alternative is to eat your BMR (or less), rejecting carbohydrates, depleting glycogen reserves, so that all your energy expenditure comes from the food you eat. when your expenditure EXCEEDS that of the food you eat, the energy MUST come from fat deposits.  **THIS IS HOW YOU LOSE FAT**.

**EDIT: KETO = EMPTY GLYCOGEN RESERVES**

**TL;DR**

* if you eat carbs regularly, you'll never deplete your muscle glycogen reserves
* in addition: insulin is telling your body to stop burning fat and to store more
* if you reject carbs, your body is forced to deplete your muscle glycogen
* you have to burn through muscle glycogen reserves before you burn fat
* this is why macros matter - in this regard, a calories is NOT a calorie.

**TL;DR2** WITH SIMPLIFIED ANALOGY!

let's say your body has one high-performance small battery and one, slow-draining, but large-capacity backup battery. your body will not use the backup battery as long as the small high performance battery has juice in it.

the small capacity battery is your glycogen levels, the high-capacity battery is your body's fat deposits. if you keep charging the small battery with carbs, the larger battery will never need to kick in and it won't. the problem with this is that there is no real limit as to how big the backup battery will get.",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,1374039221.0,,cust iebro,True,t3_1ifhww,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1ifhww/community_roundtable_lets_get_clear_on_losing_fat/,

This is my introduction post.",alycks,34,8,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1hfonq/hello_ketogains_i_eat_meat_and_lift_weights_and/,"I'm not sure if introduction posts are common here, but I thought I'd throw one out and see how it goes. I'm certainly not a beginner and though I don't have a specific question, I'd appreciate a discussion on long-term ketogenic dieting, ketogaining and intermittent fasting, and new and exciting ways to prepare eggs. 

I am pretty okay at lifting weights, I have a decent working knowledge of the nutrition and exercise literature, I want to be a doctor one day, and I do neuroscience research. I hope to become an active member of /r/ketogains and help it grow. Here is a summary of my stats, diet and training plan:

**Stats:**

* 26 year old male
* 5' 8"", 174 pounds, 18% body fat
* Intermediate weight trainer who hates cardio unless said cardio is hiking or playing a sport. I train for strength first, aesthetics second.
* Here's a [current picture](http://i.imgur.com/4CpmNPi.jpg) at roughly 18% body fat.

1RMs:

* Deadlift: 375
* Squat: 325
* Bench press: 225
* Overhead press: 135

**Diet:**

I will be doing a fairly standard CKD with a 24-36 hour carb refeed each weekend. Though I said I train for strength first, aesthetics second, I do want to get down to 10% and then just stay there indefinitely while slowly building strength. So I will be eating at a deficit until I reach my goal.

The perhaps unconventional aspect of my diet is that I intermittently fast. A lot. I eat one meal a day five days per week (ketogenic style), three meals once a week (refeed day - usually Saturday), and no meals once a week (Tuesday). So that's 23/1 most days, 16/8 one day, and 47/1 on on occasion. I do all weight training fasted, occasionally supplementing with BCAAs.

**Training:**

I train four days per week, each of those days focuses on one of those big four lifts followed by accessories to help those lifts. It's very similar to 5/3/1 in many ways, except I utilize RPT programming for the main lifts. Here is my setup:

*Monday*

* Deadlift (3 sets, RPT)
* Barbell row (3 sets, 12-15 reps)
* Hamstring curls (3 sets, 12-15 reps)

*Wednesday*

* Bench press (3 sets, RPT)
* Incline DB press (3 sets, 12-15 reps)
* Overhead triceps press (3 sets, 12-15 reps)

*Friday*

* Squat (3 sets, RPT)
* Calf raises (3 sets, 30 reps)

*Saturday*

* Overhead press (3 sets, RPT)
* Weighted chins (3 sets, 10 reps)
* Side bend
* Ab rollouts

On off days I do grip training and sometimes take walks but I'm not really very active apart from my weight training. Oh, and I bike to work everyday, 6 miles round trip.

**Background and Goals**

So I had been an ardent follower of leangains for years, even though I never successfully got below 14% body fat. The good part was that I learned about intermittent fasting, RPT training, and [how to cure fuckarounditis](http://www.leangains.com/2011/09/fuckarounditis.html). The bad part was that I became obsessed with getting ""enough"" food. Rather than listening to my body and adhering to a modest, sustainable plan I was always buying food I didn't want (carbs) and trying to stuff huge amounts of food down my throat. That, and I hate packing lunches. Leangains may work for others, but it doesn't work for me.

So in May I discovered the Steak and Eggs diet through the Mark's Daily Apple forum. It's basically CKD, except you can only eat steak, eggs, butter, and heavy cream 6 days per week. I adopted it for 3.5 weeks, loved it, lost fat, improved my reflection and increased strength. Then, for some reason, I decided to go back to leangains and eating potatoes and bread and beans and other crap I didn't really like and I gained back all the weight. So I'm just going to do CKD long-term. I don't like carbs. I like meat and fat. I could eat a dozen eggs a day and be totally content. My favorite foods are pigs, cows, eggs, butter, dark chocolate, and fruit. I'll also eat fish, bread, dairy, and some vegetables. So here it goes. 

Have any suggestions? Does anyone else fast as much as I do? Are there any other leangains refugees around?

**7/2 EDIT:** I'd like to mention that I find stretching and mobility to be very important to a successful strength training program. A few months ago I began [Starting Stretching](http://phraktured.net/starting-stretching.html) and [Molding Mobility](http://phraktured.net/molding-mobility.html), two programs by redditor /u/phrakture designed to go hand-in-hand. I urge everyone to take mobility and stretching as seriously as they take training and nutrition. It'll help prevent injury and aid in your lifts.

Hello my fellow Ketoers and sub trolls,


I haven't posted in a long while. But I thought today would be a good day to post something. (Didn't even post for my century mark) Back on June 18th I started Keto at the advisement of my Doctor's office. In the 10 1/2 months since then I have had good times and bad. Things have been slow lately, mostly cause of my food choices. Still staying low carb, but not as low carb as I should.
In that time I have lost 107 lbs. From 353 down to 246. Today I capped off what I have done so far by doing a half marathon here in Oklahoma City. Was originally going to do a 5k, but I knew I could do that. Sometimes you've got to shoot big. It was tough as hell the last 5 miles or so but I made it. Thanks for the great stories I've been able to read along the way. I'm so proud of myself that now I'm one of them.

Note: Ran the race in keto. Now in the midst of a day and a half keto break. Tuesday I go back onto super strict keto to get rid of my last 47lbs I want to lose and start training for the Half Marathon at Disneyland. Wish me luck.

Note+: That last picture. The cheeseburger was the greatest cheeseburger I've ever had. Not sure if it was the not having one for 10.5 months, or the 13.1 miles I had just done. Either way looks like i'm about to cry.

tl;dr: Lost 107lbs, ran a half marathon, victory cheeseburger




- Ran the entire thing in Keto, which I was really nervous about. Honestly didn't do my homework about what I should be doing. I start training Tuesday for the Disneyland Half Marathon (also doing a 10k the day before) so I fully intend on being ready.

I carried two 100 calorie packs of Emerald Almonds with me. The Dry roasted ones for more salt content. These helped me get through the early and mid stages.

I drank two swigs of powerade at the last few miles. By this point I had hit major cramp issues and was just trying to hold it together. This is more to do with lack of training than substance choice in my opinion.   This was sort of a test half marathon to see if I could physically finish the one I have planned in September. 

The night before I ate a dinner of hamburger meat with a low carb marinara sauce. Breakfast was some chicken and cheese about 1.5 hrs before the race.


Any advice for me going forward? Today was about finishing. Next time is about time. ",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,False,,,True,t3_1dasyy,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1dasyy/10_12_months_of_keto_107lbs_and_a_half_marathon/,

We are very excited to announce that we are going to follow in the footsteps of some of the other fitness related subreddits and begin posting Member Spotlights!

At present we are planning to post one Spotlight per month, on the first of the month. 

***What is a Member Spotlight?!***

A Member Spotlight serves two purposes. At face value they are similar to AMA threads, with two distinctions. One is that the person in the spotlight is not expected to be hanging around the thread for a set amount of time. They will, in all likelihood, drop in to see what's going on in the thread about them and answer questions, but it is not a place to come ask ""Would you rather eat a horse sized duck, or fifty duck sized horses?"" The other is that a number of the questions will be front-loaded into the original post. Going by the Member Spotlights of other subreddits we have assembled something of a starter list but if any questions are showing up consistently in the threads, or you PM ideas, they may be made standard questions.

The other is to recognize members of ketogains who have been consistent contributors, people of interest in our community, or recently achieved something extraordinary.

To reflect this second purpose we are going to ask you, the members of ketogains to send in Spotlight Nominations. In the form of a PM to this account, which will be accessible to all the moderators. We want to know who you want to hear about!

***What happens if I nominate someone for a spotlight?***

If a member of ketogains is nominated for a spotlight, first one or more of the moderators will review their posting history. This is purely to ensure that John Q. Troll doesn't come on, and say ""I'm going to nominate Newbie McNewberson for a spotlight! He won't know what he's talking about, it'll be great!""

Second, the nominee will be contacted well in advance of the upcoming spotlight post to be informed that ketogains wants to know more about them. This is their chance to decline or postpone, for whatever reasons. Nominations are private to everyone except the mods.

When the nominee accepts, they will be sent a copy of the questionnaire to be filled out at their earliest convenience. Then, unless there are followup questions or anything, the Spotlight thread is posted at the scheduled time.

***Can I nominate myself?***

We would prefer that you not nominate yourself, unless it is related to a recent or upcoming major event.

Good: ""I'm going to State next month!""

Not so good: ""I just squatted 315lbs for 20 reps for the first time!""

Use your judgement, please.

***I want to nominate someone, but I'm not sure if they'll do it...***

By all means, nominate them! They have a chance to decline or postpone, if they don't want to do it. In the worst case, they should at least get a warm fuzzy feeling that someone nominated them.

***I nominated one person, but someone else got the next spotlight... What gives?!***

One of two things happened. Either your nominee declined, or we had to put your nominee in the queue for spotlights. Depending on how many nominations we receive you might have to wait up to a few months to hear from your nominee.

***What will you do if you run out of nominees?***

Hopefully this won't happen, but if it does then the mods will put our heads together and figure something out.

Potential resolutions include:

- More time between spotlights

What is a Widowmaker, you say? It is very simple.... 

A 20 *-gasp-* repetition squat.

Yes, you do 20 squats, in one set.

Now, the Challenge as it is, is to do the heaviest Widowmaker, but to make it more fair, we are bending the rules a little.

It will be the heaviest Widowmaker, *but according to the participants weight*:

* 20 squats at 0.50x bodyweight
* 20 squats at 0.75x bodyweight
* 20 squats at 1.00x bodyweight
* 20 squats at 1.25x bodyweight
* 20 squats at 1.50x bodyweight
* 20 squats at 1.75x bodyweight

You get the idea.

*Two weeks to show off*, and one prize: your choosing of either one month of *Reddit Gold*, or one month of *Fitocracy Hero*.

Challenge must be logged on Fitocracy, as to be eligible to win. If you don't have a Fitocracy account, get one, and join the /r/ketogains group over there, then sign for the challenge, and log your workouts.

here are my stats and macros 

I started keto 8 months ago at 285 lbs and finally started lifting now when i realized my goal of &gt;10% body fat is actually a realistic long term goal now.

I get adequate fat and protein. I do not cheat in meals. Every day i hit 1400 at least most days is 15-16k. I am 205 right now and have been for the last month, and i started lifting almost exactly a month ago, wanting to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time. my question is, i am not losing any weight this last month, so is it possible i have just gained the 8-10 lbs i should have lost, in muscle? and if i continue this course, will weight come off finally or slowly? i do high rep low weight for pretty much everything in the weight room. i am getting discouraged and i need some advice. Also if it is not just muscle, i would like to know any other possibilities of what is happening and how to fix this.

***GENERAL ABOUT***

**Care to share some pictures? Do you have any before and afters?**

I’m shy ☺. Give me a few more weeks/months of keto and I’ll share some.

**What are your current stats? (Age, sex, height, weight, body fat percentage and method used)**

I’ll be 32 next month, male, 5’10, about 165 and 12-13% BF using accumeasure calipers. The problem with being Asian is that we tend to store all our body fat around the midsection – so I look close to 20% with the shirt off. First world keto problems, right?

**What is your story? What sports or athletic activities are you involved in, and when did you get into it?

I’ve never been coordinated or good at sports as a kid. I was always one of the last to be picked playing schoolyard sports. One of my best childhood memories was playing dodgeball – there was this kid Tony who was always very athletic. He threw one of his heaters and I caught it and all the kids went “ooooooh.” 

When I got into my 20s, I decided I would be more active. I was probably somewhere around 25% BF. I started lifting sporadically, but I didn’t really get active until I started training in muay thai and Brazilian jiu jitsu to teach myself self-defense. I would train 3-4 hours a day 3-4 times a week, but I would never drop any weight and it was maddening. I discovered keto and I probably came down 10 lbs of body fat in a few months. It was life changing.

Now I’m rock climbing and doing yoga pretty regularly. I added weight-lifting back into my regimen and I’m doing the Texas Method. My goal by the end of the month is to hit a 350 deadlift.


**How do you deal with naysayers, and clashes between your lifestyle and those around you?**

You know, when I first started keto, I was fascinated by the mechanics and the logic behind it. I would always try to convince people that it was the way to live, but there are a lot of people who are stuck in the older ways of thinking. They all say fat is bad for me and that I’ll have a heart attack eating all these eggs and bacon. 

But, personal victory: I’ve learned to let people live on their own terms and only try to help those that ask for it. I’ve gotten a few friends to convert – a friend of mine dropped 35 lbs in 6 weeks and is the skinniest he’s been in 10 years. He’s my keto accountability partner now and our former acquaintanceship has now become a close friendship because of it.


**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

Experiment on your own body – you are like no one else on this planet. There’s a lot of false information out there and a lot of people live their lives according to rules written by others for others. Figure out what works for you and do it.

**How do you motivate yourself? (Music, quotes, etc.)**

I’m a huge self-help junkie – I recommend everyone always question their standing beliefs in an effort to improve themselves. Don’t let others dictate what improvement is for you.


**What are your favorite sports/fitness books, DVDs, websites, or other resources?**

-

**Do you have a role model/inspiration? Anyone you would like to train with or compete against? Who, and why?

I want to train with this guy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHiKDa4ip_Q


***DIET AND NUTRITION***

**How did you end up following a Ketogenic diet?**

I read Tim Ferriss 4 Hour Body. It was crap (for me). I read somewhere that insulin was the enemy of weight loss and ended up on /r/keto - and the reason I joined reddit.

**Do you follow a Standard, Targeted, or Cyclical Keto Diet? Something different? Why?**

I try to do SKD as much as possible. Right now, my life is kind of hectic, so I’m struggling to put enough calories into my mouth, so I have a kind of on-and-off relationship with it right now.

**What does your diet look like?**

Beef, lamb, bacon, eggs, mayonnaise and whiskey – a little bit of trouble getting enough veggies into my diet, but for now, I’m ok with fiber supplements.

**Do you take and supplements? Which? What do they do for you?**

Not much except protein shakes on workout days. Instead of water, I use half and half to boost my fat intake. I figured out that 8oz of half and half and a scoop of protein powder is almost EXACTLY the amount of fat/protein you need to add to your diet to meet ratios on workout days and provides 10g of carbs which should help with the hard workouts. + fiber and salt. and steak.

**What are some diet related ideas that you hold to be true, but cannot prove?**

I think cardio is a myth for weight loss.

***Training***

**Do you compete at any level?**

Yoga, rock climbing, and weight-lifting only make you compete against yourself. I guess I compete against the scale and the calipers. :)


**What is your training plan?**

MWF – Texas method. I also do yoga and rock climb on these days, preferably before weight lifting so muscle soreness doesn’t affect my performance. If you try to do other exercises the day after you lift heavy you’re gonna have a bad time.

**What is your training philosophy?**

Lift hard, lift heavy – stop when you achieve the results you want. No man has ever said, “I am too strong.”

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training from others you see or hear about?**

Lifting and yoga simultaneously – a lot of people think these exercises are polar opposites. I think contraction (lifting) and expansion (yoga) are completely complementary for strength.


**What injuries or other setbacks have you had to deal with? What are the risks that come with your athletic endeavors? Any advice on how to deal with them?**


I’ve been fortunate enough to never get seriously injured. But I do recommend a dyna-flex ball to everyone to work stabilizer muscles in your forearms, especially if your work requires sitting at the computer a lot. 


***OFF-TOPIC***

**What do you do? (Fun, work, anything else you feel like sharing)**

My favorite hobby is precisely the opposite of keto – baking. I can bake you one hell of a sourdough loaf. I also cook a lot. I bought a sous-vide machine a few months ago and as god as my witness, I will never eat an overcooked steak again.


**You get one superpower. Which one, and why?**

If comics have taught me anything, it’s that anyone with a superpower has a six-pack. So the superpower itself is kind of moot, right? Right?

**If your biography became an audiobook, who would you want to narrate?**

Dave Chappelle

**If you could spend a day with anyone, living or dead, fictional or historical, who would it be and why?**

Winston Churchill. Now that was a man.

Just a quick post, as I seem to be getting the same questions over and over.

Classic keto macros don't apply if you are aiming to build muscle.

Use the ketogains calculator on the useful links at the sidebar and adjust your goals there.

* If you are aiming to maintain current muscle, set protein ratio to 0.8 to 1.0 per lean pound

* If you want to build muscle, set protein ratios to either 1.0 to 1.2 per lean pound (some people might want to go up to 1.5, thread carefully)

Then just adjust fat ratio to meet your daily calorie goals.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

**Care to share some pictures? Do you have any before and afters?**

As much as I'd like to, my computer situation is for shit right now, and posting pictures from a smartphone is a pain. There are a few in my post history, though.

**What are your current stats? (Age, sex, height, weight, body fat percentage and method used)**

26 years old, male, 6'4"" last I checked about 275, and Darthluiggi estimated me around 18-20% iirc.

**What is your story? What sports or athletic activities are you involved in, and when did you get into it?**

Besides lifting? I just try to make life itself into an athletic activity. Not in an extreme way, like free running, or anything. Just spending my time not sitting on my ass when I can avoid it. Within lifting, I suppose I could be colored with the ""powerlifter"" or ""strongman"" brush, with a bit of dabbling into the bodybuilding end of the spectrum.

**How do you deal with naysayers, and clashes between your lifestyle and those around you?**

I don't.

In all seriousness, I'm lucky enough to be surrounded by people who either don't butt in about the lifestyle of others, or who say to themselves ""Hm. I guess this guy knows what he's doing..."" I've only really encountered one naysayer, and his argument was ""If you keep eating like that you're going to die. Like, later this month."" - He honestly thought that was the case, and that was a few years ago, so I suppose I dealt with him by not dying?

**What advice do you take, and what do you ignore?**

It's a gut check, really. I take advice that sounds useful, and I ignore advice that sounds like bullshit. Context is very important too, though. Say some guy who's historically had small and weak arms comes in after a few years with 22"" biceps, starts curling 200lbs with good form, and gives out his secret, I'm much more likely to listen to that than the same guy coming in and curling little pink dumbbells. The main thing though is to never blindly follow advice. Even this advice which I'm giving you now.

**How do you motivate yourself? (Music, quotes, etc.)**

Set a goal, accept nothing less. On days that I'm dragging I may pull out my mp3 player and see if it has a charge, or just start yelling at myself, but most of the time just having a goal gives me the motivation I need.

**What are your favorite sports/fitness books, DVDs, websites, or other resources?**

Arnold's New Modern Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding, Chaos and Pain, Grey's Anatomy (the anatomy book not the medical drama), and exrx is handy for some quick reference charts.

***DIET AND NUTRITION***

**How did you end up following a ketogenic diet?**

I didn't even know what a ketogenic diet was, when I first started. I was 20 years old, morbidly obese, and dead set on joining the Army. I walked into the recruiting office, and thankfully I live in an area with a low incidence of walk-ins, where the recruiter establishes my level of motivation, and decides that he's going to work with me until I can get in. All he said about diet was ""No carbs."" I said ""Does meat have carbs?"" He said ""No."" and I was sold. - Coming from this background, my style of keto dieting is very different from all of you who've read these fancy books on it.

**Do you follow a Standard, Targeted, or Cyclical Keto Diet? Something different? Why?**

Probably best described as a rotating CKD - I go mad if I try to maintain any sort of keto for more than two or three months, even with the refeeds, so I alternate mesocycles of CKD and IIFYM/Don't Go Stupid

**What does your diet look like?**

Piles of meat. The old favorites are chicken breast with mustard, tuna with spicy brown mustard and hot sauce, 85% lean ground beef, and lettuce-wrapped burgers. All served with broccoli/cauliflower.

""But... But how do you get enough fat? Doesn't your protein get too high eating like that?"" I imagine at least one hypothetical reader is thinking to themself. Honestly? IDGAF. I've had days where my consumption was nearly 100% protein without breaking ketosis, or getting into ketoacidosis territory. 

**Do you take any supplements? Which? What do they do for you?**

Oh man, the answer to this question changes wildly from month to month. *Right now* I'm in the midst of a bunch of rennovation type work at home, so all my supplements are safely tucked away in a box in the closet. By and large my bare minimum is Multi, Krill Oil, ZMA, with the odd fat burner (Hey, they go on clearance sometimes.), green tea/EGCG, or ""I'm going to try this!"" bit

**What are some diet related ideas that you hold to be true, but cannot prove?**

If you focus only on making sure that you get enough protein in per day, every day, within a month 95% of the rest of your diet will fall into place in a way that works for you. 

***Training***

**Do you compete at any level?**

Presently, just the odd ""Hey, dude, let's see who can do more!"" I had my sights set on a powerlifting competition later this year, but then started doing construction work which has put a dampner on my training schedule.

**What is your training plan?**

Lift shit with the muscles that feel like lifting today.

**What is your training philosophy?**

""It doesn't count until it hurts.""

**Is there anything that you do differently in your sport/training from others you see or hear about?**

I don't set aside time for stretching, I don't do warmup sets, I don't use a spotter most of the time, I deadlift 4 times a week during strength cycles, I deadlift and squat on the same day... I could go on.

**What injuries or other setbacks have you had to deal with? What are the risks that come with your athletic endeavors? Any advice on how to deal with them?**

A few years ago I dislocated some rib heads while I was cleaning a dumbbell to military press. That has sadly left me with compromised shoulder integrity, which I deal with by going to see my chiropractor when it acts up.

More times than I care to think about I've incurred minor soft tissue injuries to my posterior chain (back, glutes, hamstrings) through training like a madman, those are usually dealt with by either training through it, or taking time off, with liberal applications of ice.

I once bruised my nipple doing push-ups...

As far as dealing with injuries... First off, know your limits. Both in terms of what you can do, and in terms of what is an injury you can ""ignore"" versus an injury where you need to start thinking about whether or not you're going to the ER. When in doubt, get professional assistance. When a professional says to take time off, do it. When your gut says to take time off, do it. Keep some protective gear on hand (For lifting that might be wraps, tape, or a brace) for those days when an old injury is starting to talk to you again.

***OFF-TOPIC***

**What do you do?** (Fun, work, anything else you feel like sharing)

I'm doing construction work right now, actually looking to get more work lined up... (hint, hint) But in that I'm still the low man on the totem pole, so I suppose you could still say that I work out for a living.

For fun, besides training and the super typical stuff, I still pretty regularly get together with the same old group from high school to play tabletop RPGs, occasionally volunteer as a roadie, go hiking, and take things apart.

**You get one superpower. Which one, and why?**

That is a tough one. I kind of feel like having a superpower would just make things too easy, so... I dunno, I'll take the Aquaman power set. I know it's more than one thing, but he's Aquaman, so it should only count as one. ;D

**If your biography became an audiobook, who would you want to narrate?**

Patrick Stewart.

**If you could spend a day with anyone, living or dead, fictional or historical, who would it be and why?**

I shall forewarn our poor mods that I'm not a pleb off the street that doesn't know his ketones from his glucose so I won't trouble you with anything particularly basic.

So, ketobulking and fat-gain. It's accepted even by the ketoest of keto-gurus that weight is a function of both calories AND hormonal activity, as is the standard view here on this subreddit. Rather than debate the obvious, I had a question that's sprung out of my own research and curiousity.

According to both Atkins and the Drs Eades (of Protein Power fame), it's pretty much physically impossible to actually gain fat-mass whilst ketogenic, and to demonstrate their point Michael Eades cites a case (I forget whether this was in the 6 Week Cure For the Middle-Aged Middle or Protein Power) of a female patient who was consuming close to 5000 calories per day (god knows how) and had no actual weight gain, yet no actual weight loss. She had attempted low-carb and massively overdid it on calories, then complained to her doctor, Michael Eades, that she wasn't LOSING weight, but he observed she wasn't GAINING it either. His suggestion if I remember correctly was that her NEPA (Non-Exercise Physical Activity; I believe that was the term- activities that are largely done subconsciously and output energy, such as shifting, fidgeting, leg-wobbling, etc) was through the roof to compensate, and her body was basically in homeostasis.

HOWEVER, the standard theory here and on other keto boards/subreddits seems to be that you WILL gain fat-mass if you overeat, regardless of your insulin/ketone levels. I'm coming off a very successful PSMF (Lyle Mcdonald's Rapid Fat Loss Diet) and thinking of switching to SKD so I can rebuild my lifts and puny-to-start-with musculature. I've had over two year's experience with lifting on an SKD, with and without cheat-days (so I guess that makes it an intermittent CKD?) so I'm not worried at all in that regard in terms of planning or execution. I highly doubt I'll ever accidentally overeat on an SKD due to its innate satiety, but in my paranoid little mind I'm curious about the possible outcome, as losing weight so rapidly has been such an arduous process, I'd cry little baby bitch tears if I put on 10 kilos trying to get my lifts back. The very act of ketobulking means excessive calories, whilst maintaining ketosis. So, do ketobulkers gain fat-mass? Is that even possible? If it is, then why would non-bulking ketogenic overeaters not gain weight?

Cheers for the insight, guys. Loving the subreddit- I checked it out a year or so ago and it was totally and disappointingly dead, you guys really breathed some life into it, I've really enjoyed lurking and learning here.

TL;DR: Do ketobulkers gain fat if under ketogenic threshold of carbs (ie 50 grams/day roughly)? If so, why and how, and if not, cool?

Edit: And if our handsome mods are feeling generous and wish to give me advice for my upcoming program (not that I'm necessarily asking) my stats are as follows: 6'1 (185-187 cm, depending on the measuring machine/method), 83 kilograms (182.9 lb), lifting on-and-off for about 8 years, this time on for about 6 months using primarily powerlifting programs (I believe to begin with I did SS, may have tried 5/3/1 and then went with Barry Ross' 3/5 program [aka Tim Ferriss' 'Effortless Superhuman' from The 4 Hour Body]). In the wake of my PSMF I'm weak as a kitten due to low cals and low starting strength- highbar back squat (stance as wide as possible, lol powerlifting) 90kgs/198 lbs 2RM approximately, bench (bodybuilder style because my crappy back hates arching) 60kgs/132 lbs 2RM, 6-7 thick-bar parallel-grip chinups per set, and no deadlifts lately because I haven't had a coach in 3 years and I fuck up deadlifts bad without supervision due to horrific spinal structure. My bodyshape has basically been: Skinny-weak -&gt; skinny-fat-weak -&gt; fat/obese-weak -&gt; skinny-fat-weak. I'm sorry this post is all over the shop, I made the mistake of joining a university and just pulled an all-nighter, but curiousity is getting the better of me.

Now that I'm doing SL 5x5 plus climbing plus running, I've been worried that I'm not getting enough protein.

Eating keto since September 2012. Weight dropped off super fast for a couple of months, then the holiday season came along as did a holiday interstate, and I chose to enjoy some carby treats. They were awesome, incidentally, and totally worth going through readaptation. 

I started losing weight again in January, but very slowly. Joined a gym, hired a personal trainer, and started lifting... and oh my god, the fat just fell off me. Not much weight change - probably 5-6kg since the start of the year - but I'm down to 22% body fat, and I am so much stronger!

Started out eating about 1200 cal/day, then moved up to 1400. I was doing cardio all along, mostly swimming (about a kilometre twice a week or so) and walking. Currently I eat pretty much whatever the hell I can stuff in - I've calculated maintenance at around 2000 cal, so I aim for about 1600 on non-workout days and more like 1900-2000 on gym days. More if I'm hungry, especially if I've done weights and cardio on the same day. If I eat less, I'm tired and lethargic, so I figure I'll just listen to my body on that one.

I feel great. And it's only going to get better from here. My body goals now are more about body fat and strength - I don't care what I weigh any more.

* **Avocado** – A keto staple, high in fat, low net carbs, quite calorie-dense and easy to eat raw. **160 calories per 100g – 200g spread across day easily doable**

* **Pork rinds/crackling** – Tasty, a typical 'snack' food, extremely calorie-dense, trace carbohydrates and a protein:fat ratio that is almost perfect keto. Highly satiating due to this. **430 calories per 70g bag – One bag a day max due to satiety.**

* **Protein Shake Cocktail** – Whey protein, blended with hazelnut milk, almond butter, heavy cream and coconut oil. Basically a protein/fat bomb that'll probably run in at around 3-400 calories for the whole shake. Can imagine to be very filling but easy enough to chug down at the end of the day to hit my calories; probably especially good in the summer over some ice.

Any suggestions to foods that won't fill me up too much but still provide me with some decent calories would be great!",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,False,,,True,t3_1ihibc,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1ihibc/high_calorie_keto_snacks/,

I never ran before I started keto. I wanted to but I hated the way my hips bounced around and I felt fat. After starting keto I didn't want to do anything but run, so I did. First was for like 30 seconds. Slowly I made it to two minutes. After what seemed like an eternity, one day I did five whole minutes. I never thought I would pass five minutes at a time, let alone a total of ten minutes in one session (with five minutes walking in between).

On Sunday, I walked. Ran for 5 minutes. Walked fast for two and a half. And ran for another SEVEN. And a HALF. Minutes. On top of the five I already did. 

I was in absolute shock and awe that I did that.

Earlier in the day I spoke with one of our managers about cardio machines and how I don't really use them, more as a warm up before lifting...and he said ""just try a little harder. Stay on it for 40 minutes instead."" And I did just that. 47 minutes, 3 miles, 12.5 total minutes of running and the most satisfying personal best ever.

I had minor surgery a week ago to remove my wisdom teeth so for a week i have been pretty lax on my diet and have been doing something more of a low carb diet than keto for the last week (about 40 carbs a day).

Now that the pain and bothers have subdued i have decided its a good time to reevaluate my macros on the calculator and i think it would be wise to ask for some help so i dont shoot myself in the foot.

[This is me as of today at 179.6 lbs (81.5 kg) 5'11"" (178cm) 32years old.](http://imgur.com/a/3wMm0#0) 

I havent really exercised for most of my life and have lost like 70 pounds on keto in the last 6 months.

I put myself at roughly 22% BF (maybe more?) although my scale swears i have 20.5% i think she is just sweettalking me so i dont throw it away.

Im as sedentary as it gets, i spend most of my time in front of the computer , only thing i do is once a day (6 times a week) walk 20 minutes to the swimming pool and swim 1km in about 35 minutes then walk 20 minutes to home.

I try to log about 2000 calories a day with roughly 25-30 carbs whether i actually go to the pool or take the day off.

So in the album there is the last configuration of the calculator that i have made this morning , i would appreciate any help and advice on my setup (maybe im eating too much , or overestimating what i spend on the pool? maybe im aiming for too big of a deficit (20%) now that i dont have as much to lose as i did ,  should i lower the protein since i dont exercise that much?).

Those are the kind of questions i have.

My goal is to keep losing body fat /weight while keeping whatever small amount of muscle i have.

I want to eventually join a gym to start lifting some , but atm i cant justify the money.

I did keto in the style of The Art &amp; Science of Low Carbohydrate Performance from January - April of this year, lost 20 pounds of annoying post-baby weight (the baby is 5, so that was getting to be a pretty weak excuse).  I'm back doing keto again because I had an injury layoff and then an awesome vacation where I drank too much and put on about 10lbs from the combination.  

Basically, I read the FAQ, and I gotta ask: Does it need to be so complicated?  If a standard ketogenic diet is working, why mess around with CKD &amp; TKD?  This may be a bias from reading Volek &amp; Phinney, but if you're running on fat, with steady energy levels and decent performance, why screw around with carbohydrate timing?   Is this something that applies more to lifting VERY heavy weights, I don't usually lift more than myself.  

What I have liked a lot about keto is that it's simple.  I have a lot going on and I often train in the evenings... when I was following more conventional bodybuilding type eating plans from trainers and such, (which incidentally never worked) there was always this weirdness with post-workout meals right before bed.  With keto, I can eat a heavy lunch &amp; light dinner (so I don't hurl), train after dinner, go to sleep, get up and eat breakfast with no real consequences to my energy levels or training.  It's easy.  Easier than eating moderate carbs even, when I get cranky if I don't get some carbs after training.  With keto I don't have to think about it, I just stay within my carb sweet spot and don't eat after dinner, and BAM, weight loss.

today is june 7th, 2013. i'm gonna go HAM on keto until the end of the month (about 3 1/2 weeks) and post updates. this is where I am now.

I'm about 13% BF. 170lbs this am, which means if I want to drop below 10%, i need to lose 5+lbs of fat while hopefully packing on muscle.

the photo might be a little deceiving, but the BF% was done on accu- measure calipers. asians tend to carry more around the trunk (i have 6mm of fat on my thighs) or maybe i'm just shit at measuring.

June 7, 2013:

* deadlift: 295 1RM
* bench: 215 1RM
* squats: 315 1RM

the goal is to maintain keto as strict as possible, aiming for 20g or less a day. no cheat days. carbs from half and half (10g per 8 oz) to have a fat shake before workouts - not included in the 20g.

in the case of a cheat day (life happens), intermittent fasting for 16 hours post meal and right into keto and workout as soon as possible.

workout regiment is texas method.

~180g of protein (1.2g/lean) = ~720kcal

~165g of fat = ~1480 kcal.

**what's the importance of this?**

well, with this new information, it's easy to find new ways to meet macros. if you don't want to do the math or portion your meals, here's an extremely easy to remember rule of thumb:

to meet your ketogains macros, eat normal keto. **to supplement the extra calories, all you have to do is drink 1 scoop of protein shake mixed in 8 oz of half and half.**



a low-carb protein powder has about 25g of protein, and half and half has 28g of fat and 7g protein. this provides 32g of protein and ~30g of fat, the exact amount more you should be adding to your diet to meet your ketogains macros. it's as simple as that.

I decided to make a change. I had heard of the keto diet before, but never really knew much about it. Of course I was skeptical, as I assume most of the general population is, on how eating such large amounts of fat could possibly lead to fat loss. 

After plenty of research (plenty coming from this subreddit), I dived in.

I just wanted to give the community an update and ask for some advice.

You may recall my first post, I am the guy who lost weight with senior prom/going to college goals. I weighed 175 at my senior prom (June 2013) [maybe throw in a picture later], down from 250.3 in August 2012.

I currently weigh 174 (up 8 lbs from mid-week 166), and I've just noticed myself fucking up a lot recently. My food habits are still fucked and recently eating late at night after hanging out on weekends destroys all my work form the weekdays.

I have 24 lbs to go to 150.3. I want to lose these 24 the right way, with a commitment to keto, and to not binge-eating late at night. I think I can realistically lose 10-15 (hoping to lose some water upon reentering keto) before college, which would be awesome.

Big ups to darthluiggi, telling me not to crash diet and maintain more muscle.

I've been trying to improve my pull ups.  I'd stalled at 3 in a row, back in April, and haven't really improved.  I upped it from working on them 1 day a week to 2 or 3 days.  I've been putting a chair in front of the pull up bar, and doing 5 sets of 5 using my legs as little as possible.  The hardest part of the pull up is the very bottom of the motion - if I fudge the ROM at the bottom by just a few inches, I can do 3 easily.  If I'm strict about going to a full hang, I can only sometimes get that 3rd one in.  I test for how many I can do every other week or so, on rested arms, and I've never been able to break 3.  I've even been eating more the last month, since I wouldn't mind putting on weight, but I just can't seem to do more pull ups.  

Are there better methods for increasing the number of pull ups?  There are dozens of programs online, but I'm not sure if there is a BEST way, or a better way than I'm working it.  Is there something I can do to strengthen the muscles for the very bottom of the motion?

Why not the other way around?

If we get bigger by feeding our bodies as it rebuilds itself, doesn't it make more sense to eat more on rest days to fuel the body?

(x-post r/keto),NotSoHastyHobbit,24,9,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/16g3c0/my_experience_with_carb_refeeds_xpost_rketo/,"**EDIT:** Since this was an x-post from r/keto I assume you guys already know the basic stuff, but I left the obvious details you gainers know :)

Sup guys, just a quick background: I started keto on October 1st 2012, que WWE spokesman ""weighin' in One Hundred and nintey poundzz""...and dropped down to around 150 at the end of December. Ever since then, my gym performance has gone to shit, and muscles are flatter than holy hell. My appetite was incredibly higher than it was when I started, I was just tired of these last 10 lbs staying with me forever and not budging.

Anyways, I read some books by Lyle McDonald including The Ultimate Diet 2.0, The Ketogenic Diet, and Flexible Dieting and wow, that man is really a genius. I took his advice and did a brutal glycogen depleting workout and almost threw up. It's basically 3 exercises per major body part (Chest, quads, arms, delts, back, etc.), with 4 sets of 15 reps, and so after the workout I came home and started the refeed, and it was a good time. 

My macros in the first day were: 50g fat/350g carbs/180g protein. The second day was 45g fat/300g carbs/150g protein and finally the last day they were 40g fat/250g carbs/150g protein. I have resumed keto (&lt;50g carbs) today, and will hopefully do the next refeed in 10 days. [This is how my arms looked on the third day](http://i.imgur.com/4UMS9.jpg)...yeah, r/swoleacceptance anyone? :)

Who should do carb refeeds? In my opinion, only weight lifters, sprinters, and anaerobic based athletes (soccer, lax, football) should do them. My incline DB press went from 55 lbs on each side to 70 lbs within a few days. My two pack turned into a 4 pack (4 more to go baby!). My muscles feel full.

Who should not do refeeds? Sedentary individuals, joggers, and walkers. Since these people don't engage in anaerobic activity (85% energy derives from glucose in anaerobic acitivity), fat is a fine fuel and will spare protein because protein and glucose requirements are not high at all for aerobic exercise.

Just a quick note as well, when you do refeeds, stick to paleo, please. I had a lot of flour, grains, etc. the first day and pooped my brains out. The second day I switched to sweet potatoes, pumpkin squash, and white potatoes and felt much better. I added rice too and it worked well, just stay away from gluten it will fuck you up.

If you have any questions feel free to ask, and [bodyrecomposition.com](http://bodyrecomposition.com) is Lyle's blog and he has good articles on this subject. Please don't be close minded and automatically carbs are bad for everyone, because they really aren't, just use them correctly. They're a great fuel source for high intensity activity and Dr. Ellis is wrong, you cannot sustain high intensity using intramusclular triglycerides...this is just wrong and he's a nut and don't listen to him, he hasn't had a piece of fruit in over 10 years and looks like he's going to crumble into dust.

Once again I got a question or an idea, I don't know what to call it.

I am on SKD for a longer time now (6months) and have made damn good progress, but it is pretty hard to get under 10% bf.

I read a lot in the last time and yes I a also read the FAQ.
I read about the CKD and the TKD, but also about carbnite and leangains. 

At the moment I am doing a SKD + leangains approach. 
I skipp breakfast and get my first and biggest meal after my workout. I only take some BCAA's before my workout.

I read the CNS by Kiefer and he stats that after a longer phase of hypocaloric and/or low carb eating, leptin and other fatburing hormones are lowered. Thus he states that to enhance your fatloss, one night (6-8 hours) of carbs is necessary/enough to enhance fatloss again.

It is a similar approach as the CKD, with one exception: ON the CKD you are going to eat 1-2 days of carbs, but on the CNS you only eat 6-8 hours (especially at evening since the cells are more insulin resistant).

So my question (since I am pretty neurotic when it comes to weight gain): Is it possible to enhance the (my) fatloss if you stay strict keto for 6 days and then eat carbs in a 6-8 hour window (still only in moderation (maintenance or slightly above). Plus combined with a IF eating pattern.


Or is a strict SKD + leangains still my best choice?

Super nice kid. So if you see this, nice talking to ya and thanks for the tips.

The tip: take a barbell and put 45s or more on each side, pick it up off the floor and get in a squat position with the barbell resting on the knees so it acts like a counter balance. Lean side to side and back and forth from the ankle.

I haven’t been to Italy before, and I'm expecting lots and lots of carbs; pasta, pizza, bread, gelato, cannoli.

Any Italians lurking here, or anybody been to Italy for a holiday. How do you think I will fair with staying on Keto?

Surprisingly, I haven't had problems in too many other holiday destinations (but I do get some odd looks and occasionally have to eat around carbs when they bring me the burger with the bun and chips!! FFFffffuuuu)

Also planning on doing lots of body weight strength training, which is usually what I do when I'm away. Bring on the Push Ups, Chin Ups, Pull Ups, Sit Ups, Hyperextensions, Russian Twists, Planks, Wall Sits, Pistol Squats, And Burpees. I've got this great new exercise, Scapula Push Up, to help develop my serratus anterior in between chin ups sets.

I did my first workout on Monday, just light hand weights for upper body and 40 body weight squats. For the last two days I have been walking around like Frankenstein, yelping every time I need to sit or stand.

I am female, 364 pounds and looking to lose fat.  Have been on SKD for a few months and have lost more inches then pounds, but what the hey, it's all going in the right direction..

I have a few questions..

1. My weight has gone up 5 pounds since that work out. Does weight lifting increase water retention?

2. Today is my next workout day, is it okay to train when I'm still suffering in my jocks from the last session?

3. What can I have before/during/after training to help reduce DOMS?

I figured since I was just starting I would do the first week light, but goddamnit, hate to see what actually using decent weight would do!

Anywho, I LOVE weight training, looking forward to progressing, and having a strong fit body, but just need some tips about beating DOMS into sub :D

**Edit: UPDATE. I did my training session with my sore 'thighs of hot fury', but didn't go quite as hard, just enough to work the muscle and get the blood moving, and though it was tough at the time, not long afterwards my legs started feeling better.

I usually don't track macros, but I am this month very closely.   I was out of ketosis probably the last few days of May for sure, but pretty sure I'm back in due to a 23 mile bike ride yesterday.  Weighed in at 230 yesterday morning and down to 224 this morning. I can post some macro calculator/MFP log/last weeks work out log too if you guys wish.

I used skin calipers last week and got ~14%.  Couldn't find them this morning, so I used the tape measure method and got 16%.  But looking at the comparison pics, I feel like I'm a tad higher. I know this has been annoying lately, but was wondering if anybody wants to guesstimate BF. I just want a few other opinions.

So... I've mostly been doing machines.  I have tried a few free squats (probably 3 to be exact) and it was really painful.  I also created a stir, because I asked someone to help, and everyone followed suit by watching me.  = [

I'm still quite overweight, and I've been doing keto for almost two months now.

The machines seem fine, but I obviously gain so much more from free weights.

I can't decide on a program either.  I sort of just float from machine to machine and lift for a while.

I've got the reps down, I've got the idea of what weight I should/can lift, but I seriously have no direction.  I suspect that this lack of rigidity is a bad thing.

1361793520.0,12,self.ketogains,196sbe,"Track running, glycogen and reduced performance. ",gazhowell,15,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/196sbe/track_running_glycogen_and_reduced_performance/,"Hi,

I've got a few specific questions if anyone out there can help me. I've done hours worth of reading but can't seem to find conclusive answers specific to my queries. I apologise in advance for the length of this post but I've got no one who would understand what I'm talking about without saying ""no carbs are you mad?!"" I've learned a lot from Jeff Volek and Stephen Phinney's studies on performance, plus Peter Attia's own personal experiments.

I'm a competitive runner, I race 5K and 10K with the occasional half marathon and other distances, but my focus is the first two. As a consequence my training is very VO2max and Lactate Threshold based. I'm on the track twice a week where I do all my speed work which would consist of sessions ranging from say 15 x 300m to maybe 6 x 1 mile (plus a 3rd session of similar structure but off-road on grass/trails). All at the highest pace I can sustain to keep them all even, so whilst each individual effort isn't flat out, it's certainly in the VO2max region, so presumably very reliant on glycogen. 

Ok so my worries are due to performance and whether this diet is capping my ability levels and subsequent race performance. I've been on strict keto now for about 75 days and I'm fully fat adapted. Blood ketone readings on the monitor have been showing levels ranging from 1.1 to 3.1mM β-hydroxybutyrate so a definite state of nutritional ketosis with no risk of false readings from ketostix. 

What I've found is that for my aerobic paced running, long runs and suchlike I feel like I've got an endless supply of energy, I could carry on all day and I'm only limited by the soreness in my muscles from the previous day or morning's session. That is great. BUT I do feel like for speedwork my upper limit has been reduced. For example, last night we did 15 x 300m on the track and even though I completed the session fine, I felt that I didn't have an extra top gear to go into, especially during the last few efforts. I used to ramp up the pace and do an especially fast one at the end, but this time I was struggling to cling onto my club mates to do a 50s last rep, when 3 months ago I could absolutely drop them and throw in a 45s last rep. It seems raw power has been lost. 

So a few thoughts:
(a) Every time I run now and feel anything bad like tiredness I instantly think oh it must be my diet and it throws doubt over the whole thing. In the past when I'd be tired I'd just get on with it but now I've got something to blame. 
(b) It's the back end of winter, maybe my speed is just low due to the time of year and I'll be strong come summer
(c) Depiste keto being one of the only diets which supposedly maintains lean body mass, maybe I've lost muscle mass from my weight loss, not just fat. I stare at my quads now and think surely they were bigger than that before?! Lol. 
(d) I've read from some of the experts like Peter Attia and Jeff Volek that they don't recommend keto for say a 400m athlete as it would reduce their ability due to glycogen depletion, it is better for endurance athletes. Whilst I am actually an endurance event athlete, I use sprint and middle distance for training so I've got a cross over. 

So to continue this epic length post, a few questions if you can bear with me a little longer:

(1) Ketosis apparently isn't synonymous with glycogen depletion according to a few experts, but how is that so when the whole way it works for weight loss initially is that you dump out your glycogen stores (plus water) and stay in a depleted state? When you become fat adapted do you just prefer to burn fat/ketones first and then only tap into your glycogen stores when you need to, so for intense exercise? Why would your body have loads of glycogen and not use it in front of fat/ketones?
OR, do you just have very depleted stores but not ZERO stores and hence I can do most of my speed session but towards the end what little glycogen I had has been burned up hence nothing left for an all out final burst of speed?

(2) I've been reading about CKD and TKD as a way of solving my problems. CKD doesn't make sense to me due to the fact I train every day, so the carb up at the weekend would make me think it wouldn't fit in with the other 5 days maybe. TKD however does sound very promising, from what I gather I basically stay in ketosis all the time apart from having carbs pre and post session which are essentially used for that session only and then I slip back I to ketosis as the carbs are all used up. 
How does that work though, surely that doesn't replenish glycogen stores having carbs before a workout, doesn't it take time to digest the dietary sources and then store them as glycogen? So wouldn't I essentially just still have depleted glycogen stores but a load of circulating fuel in the digestive system/blood stream? Is the circulating fuel able to be utilised efficiently enough to be the instant energy my muscles need or would they prefer to have glycogen already in them so to speak? 

Sorry for such a long post, I imagine it'll put a lot of people off reading it. I'm basically at a crossroads now whether to keep keto-ing on or to switch to a diet including carbs. The thing is I absolutely LOVE this way of eating, loads of fats and things that are great with no guilt!, so I'm reluctant to change, but first and foremost it's my athletic performance that matters to me. I would NEVER consider going back to the conventional high carb diet but if I had to change I would maybe look at some sort of primal diet including tubers etc as my carbs, or maybe some slow release complex carbs.

I'm currently a 6'2"" M and about 212lbs, 31YO.. BF%, I don't know. I started at 230lbs, went down to about 216lbs within about a month, and then started lifting.

The few breaks were mostly field exercises where MREs were the only food available, or some similar situation. I am male, 6'3'', 186 lbs earlier today, and I estimate about 21-23% BF, based on photos and online calculators (I don't have calipers). I am doing SL 5x5. I'm at the end of my fourth week now, and starting to see some real progress strength- and growth-wise.

My question is: is there an advantageous time to make protein available for my body for anabolism? Right now, I eat about 2200 calories a day on workout days, and about 1800 on rest days. On rest days I do stretching and flexibility work, but that's it. 

I eat breakfast at 7:00, and lunch at 11:00. I take an ON shake and creatine right before workout (which is usually around 1:00 pm) and another with creatine right after. I try to fit in my most-carby snack (Justin's Maple almond Butter) sometime in the afternoon after my workout, then I eat dinner at 6:30 pm. These times are a little bit flexible, but I am at the mercy of the chow halls and my shop's work schedule. Is there a time when I should take more protein? I figure more fat (especially my beloved coconut oil, from what I read in other posts) is advantageous before my workout for extra quick-burning fuel source, since I haven't reached the point where I need carbs pre-workout. I have a lot of flexibility with my protein, as I can load up protein at either lunch or dinner and have mostly salad for the other, or I can make up a couple of ON shakes to have any time.

I have read some places that it's better to take more protein later in the day after workout so the body uses it overnight, but I think my source was old and possibly outdated. I wanted to know what r/ketogains thought about it, or what articles or studies you have used to make your own decisions.

Just wanted to update, and say thanks for the advice.

So I'd been eating about 1400 cal/day (base: more on training days), because I'd calculated that that was a small deficit from my TDEE but above my BMR. Using a different calculator that incorporates body fat percentage, though, I discovered that my BMR is a little more than 1500. So I suppose eating below BMR is fine if that's what you want to do, but it isn't what I want to do - I still want to lose fat, so I want to eat below TDEE but *definitely* above BMR!

So I've raised my calorie intake to 1600 on non-training days, and add another 200 or so on training days. More if I do both strength and cardio. That seems to have solved the problem of being tired all the freaking time, and fat loss has not been impacted as far as I can tell. (My weight on the scales is not going down much, but I am definitely building muscle, and visually I think I appear leaner).

The other thing is that I have started some simple TKD. Half a banana before a workout, and suddenly I can do three sets of weighted squats, not *barely barely* squeezing out two. Feels good! Losing strength during workouts wasn't my main concern when I posted last, but I tried it anyway to see how it would work for me, and I think it really has.

So thanks for the assistance on my last post. Really appreciate it. :)",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,False,,,True,t3_1abmix,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1abmix/noob_update_tkd_calorie_increase_feeling_good/,

Currently been doing SKD for 2 weeks, have done multiple trial runs in the past and with all the knowledge I've gained I'm now doing it hardcore. I want to get down to 10-12% bodyfat and weigh about 175-180lbs. I weight train at least 4 days a week, pretty intensely anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half. On days I do a shorter workout I will play tennis for about 1.5-2 hours. I play tennis at a high level so for about 60% of the time I'm playing it's like doing high intensity interval training, lots of sprinting and many times I'm gassed after a point.

I take C4 before working out and that gives me a great pump and energy since it has creatine, beta alanine, vitamins and caffeine. Sometimes though I feel very tired once I hit the courts and I know its due to not having any glycogen in my muscles. I know I'm tired when I'm late to the ball and can't get my feet set because my legs are fatigued and then my shots aren't clean.

From my understanding of CKD, once a week you consume a certain amount of carbs which goes into the blood in the form of glucose, some will be used for energy since its readily available but most will be stored as glycogen since your body is still in ketosis and primarily burning fat as energy. My thought it why even do CKD if I'm this active? That one re-feed session's glycogen will probably be completely burned by the 2nd day after the re-feed leaving 4 days of no glycogen. Why not just have the carbs prior to the activity? The glucose will be readily available in the blood for the muscles to use. I'm talking like 20-30g or so anywhere from 15min to an hour prior depending on how fast the carb is absorbed in the body. What about a gatorade after the gym but before and during tennis? Will this hinder fat loss? What's the advantage  of CKD over this scenario?

Sorry for the wall of text, I guess I have more to say than I realized..

Like the title says, I've been in keto for two months and, while I'm getting some great definition in my muscles, especially my torso, I've actually been gaining weight. 

This is the second time I've done keto; the first time, I went for two months, and also gained about 5lbs. I never lost the 10lbs in water weight everyone talks about. The only evidence that keto is working for me is the part where I'm definitely getting more definition, and the little belt of fat on my waist is shrinking steadily. Still though I want to know why I'm only gaining weight, and haven't lost any. 

I do the Stripped 5x5 routine religiously, have been for the last month. I supplement it with running 2.5 miles on my off days, or throwing P90x Plyometrics into the DVD played. I don't count calories, and since none of my family are in keto, I end up eating mostly 2-6 scrambled eggs a day, along with whatever sandwich meat and cheese I can find in the fridge. I try to stay under the 20g carb limit, I google the carb count of everything I eat. However, I take creatine, protein supplements, and muscle milk on the days I lift, which is about 18g of carbs. On off days I only take muscle milk. 

TL:DR I workout 5 days a week, eat scrambled eggs and sandwich meat, have been for the last 2 months, take creatine, muscle milk, and protein, and I've actually gained a solid 5lbs. Help?

This is eating a diet of eggs, chicken w/ skin, cheese, bacon, beef, pork, veggies, steak etc. On gym days I take a protein shake but the main problem is I don't consume enough calories (i think), for the past two weeks I've averaged about ~1500 calores a day give or take 100. Now my goal is to lose the fat and achieve a flat stomach basically and some definition but I'm getting lost in all the science behind it - I just need some advice, should I keep doing what i'm doing, do I need to eat more? do i need to eat a surplus to gain the muscle I need to not look skinny-fat? or do I need to eat at a good defecit to allow the shed the fat and allow muscle to show, despite the fact i'm already a normalish weight. using myfitnesspal to calculate food amounts but really hating it, would rather 'freelance'. Any advice would be awesome to get me through this rough patch.

 &gt;TL;DR Lost 30lb and 11% BF with keto and a 4-day split; want to gain strength, muscle and lose fat and understand/welcome the fact that this will be a very slow process

I have made decent progress in the 4 months I've been combining lifting with keto (at a deficit) – I've had my n00b gains and cut down from 216lb, 31% BF to 187lb, 20%.

All very promising and all very standard in terms of a newbie going at it hard.

I do a 4-day split, all lifts 8-12 reps:

**Mon:** Shoulders/Tris (Seated Shoulder Press, Hang Power Cleans, Shrugs, Kickbacks and cable pushdowns)

**Tues:** Back (Bent over barbell rows, lat pulldowns, weighted rows, one-arm rows)

**Thurs:** Chest/Bi (Flat barbell bench, incline dumbbell bench, flyes and cable crossover, various curls)

**Fri:** Legs (Deadlift, Squat, Leg Extension, Leg Curl, Calf Raise)


**1RMs**

Deadlift: 120kg

Squat: 100kg

Bench: 60kg

OHP: Never tried


I have been eating at a consistent deficit and losing fat at a decent pace; I am by no means happy with my current BF% but I am willing to swap fast progress here for progress elsewhere. That is pretty much true for the 'big goals' everyone sets; I don't mind losing fat much slower if I can increase my lifts while I do it.

My plan is to follow a simple and slow body recomp; where I modify my split to include strength sets before my 'hypertrophy' sets, kind of like 5/3/1 with accessory work; so on Mondays I would add heavy OHP; Tuesdays heavy Deadlifts; Thursdays heavy bench and Fridays heavy squats. 

I would eat at a surplus on strength days and eat at significant deficit on my off days. Probably adding cardio, but not religiously.

I figure my alternatives are:

Carry on at a deficit, watch my n00b gains taper off and cut relatively quickly but with little muscle/strength gains
Bulk – Bulking at 20% BF doesn't appeal to me, as content as I am to see my fat loss progress slow right now I do not want to see it stall/go backwards.

So, the above is my take on the middle ground between these two; big eating and big lifting for strength, hypertrophy accessory work for muscle and large deficit rest days for fat loss. I am content to be 'unoptimised' in all three areas in order to see (much slower) progress across the board.

Am I simply asking far too much of my body? Am I being totally stupid? If so, tell me! I will continue dieting down to a BF% I am happy with and attempt a slow, strength-focussed bulk. Of course, any suggestions as to how not to be completely stupid here would be absolutely grand.

Cheers, and many apologies for the wall of text!

My question is: on a ketogenic diet, particularly the standard one, can you lose fat and gain muscle at the same time? Before you jump, I am well aware that the standard advice (as in, to people on non-keto diets) is ""no, that just isn't possible"" but I don't actually see why it wouldn't be given the particulars of ketogenesis. The diet is DESIGNED to burn fat, and I would think that if you maintain your calories and have a high enough protein intake (along with lifting for hypertrophy) you would, in effect, be doing both (as in: losing fat and gaining muscle).

Also, despite the fact that it is the ""least efficient"" and basically worst way to go about ketogains, I want to attempt to cut body-fat and build muscle simultaneously as best I can.  I lift 5 times a week, ending with a comlex, for about 60 minutes per session.  I weigh 205lbs and am about 24%BF(visual estimate).
This is my first time using the Ketogains calculator and I was pretty surprised to see that my maintenance calories for a workout day are **3278**, which seems like a lot to me.  This puts my protein and fat consumption at 187 and 270 respectively.  

Now to the QUESTION:My strategy given these numbers would be to eat at maintenance levels on training days and at a deficit (2441) on off days.  Do these numbers seem to check out?

I'm a pretty novice lifter, I'd say. A lot of you might know me from /r/keto but here's a quick rundown:

- I lost 212 pounds on SKD. Over a year. Not a single cheat day.
- I don't plan on deviating from SKD for any reason, really. CKD/TKD don't interest me.
- I still have weight to lose. 
- Here is my breakdown from the ketogains calc: http://i.imgur.com/A3Q88g6.png

Anyway. I follow the Starting Strength program, pretty much. I don't deadlift anymore, because Planet Fitness doesn't allow it (yeah, yeah, I know they're not the best but it's what I have money for right now, so I deal). I've replaced it with the linear leg press. Maybe I should switch to dumbbell deadlifts? 


But here's the thing - after my sets of squats and all that... I don't ""feel the burn"" that everyone else claims. I've advanced in my lifts. They're not the best, but they're improving.

- Squat: 3x5 195 lb
- Bench: 3x5 115 lb (This is my shameful weak point....)
- Deadlift: 1x5 275 lb
- Overhead Press: 3x5 105 lb (Just barely... again, my arms are crap)
- Power Clean: Planet Fitness. Can't do it. :( 

So anyway... what else can I add? Things I really want to work on:

- Triceps. I have the batwings. I hate the batwings. I want them to go away.
- Core. My stomach is a god damned disaster. Seriously.
- Pecs. Moobs. I want these gone. They've gone down, but still.

I initially planned on doing my isolation weight training, the complex and then 10 mins of cardio. The isolation weight training took around 40mins and then I did the complex with 3 lifts only; the front squat, barbell row and the back squat. I was supposed to add lunges aswell but I had already done dumbell lunges as part of the isolation workout. I did a increasing/decreasing pyramid of 7, 8, 9, 8, 7 and my legs were more or less gone by the end. Didn't even bother with the cardio lol. I probably could have used a heavier weight, but I didn't want it to be too taxing since tomorrow is one of my 3 weekly main 5x5 lifting days and the front squats I've only recently added to my routine so that was my limiting lift really as I have no idea how heavy I can go. I'm planning on adding an extra lift each week until I get to 6-8 lifts in total. I could totally see this replacing cardio although my cardio has already reduced significantly (from doing an hour to doing 20mins and increasing strength training instead) :D


I probably will do complexes on my main lifting days (Tuesdays/Thursdays/Saturdays) and my normal cardio (20 mins on cross training with high resistance) on isolation days only (Mondays/Wednesdays). Might even get rid of the cardio! 


Btw, I'm a beginner to lifting. I did strength training before but stopped so now I'm gradually building up to my previous max lifts (which weren't much to begin with) and hoping to increase those and get stronger. Most importantly, I am concentrating more on maintaining good form. 


If you have any advice or think I could change anything, please let me know. All advice will be taken on board (if possible).

I have just updated the [Keto Calculator](http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/) (Version 4.8), with calculation of essential body fat. In short, this means your suggested lower intake has gone up a bit so it is a good idea to recalculate.

Men have about 3% of essential fat that they can not lose, women about 9-12% (the calculator uses 11%). This essential fat is now taken into account for the calculation of the minimum caloric intake, and also in the calculation for the weight loss graph.

In practice that means if you have a lot of weight to lose, this update most likely won't change anything for you. If you are already quite lean, this will give you a higher minimum caloric intake.

Here are the details, if you are interested: Your body fat and lean body mass is calculated in kg based on your given body fat percent and weight. From lean body I calculate the essential fat in kg. To calculate the body fat you can actually lose, subtract essential fat from body fat. This non-essential body fat can give off at most 28g/lb per day. So since with the update the essential body fat does not contribute any more to weight loss in the calculation, your minimum caloric intake will go up; especially if you do not have much body fat.

Please reply if you find something odd or have any ideas for improvements.

**Background:**

Already hit my previous goals on Keto (lost 25 lbs, have the six pack, etc.).  Now I'd like to get back up to half my previous weight, but with muscle.  I still train really hard and am pretty sure I'm losing muscle mass as a result.  Need to re-introduce carbs, just not sure what type and when, exactly.  Trying to create a visual day by day layout.

**Stats:**

6'2""
190 lbs.
~13% BF 

**Goals:**

Main goal is to gain ~10lbs of muscle (keep same relative BF%, but get from 190 to 200).  

**Current Workout Plan:**

6 days a week. Cardio then weights each day.
Cardio: 2-6 mile run (vary it up between HIIT and Steady-Pace)
Weights:  Rotate Push/Pull/Legs across the 6 days.  Throw in some ab/isolation work when I feel I need it.
	Push = Bench (flat, incline, decline), Shoulder Press, Cable Flys, Dips, Triceps, etc.
	Pull =  Dumbbell Rows, Lat Pulldowns, Cable Rows, Back Flys, Bicep Curls/Pull-ups, etc.
	Legs = Squats (or Goblet Squats), Weighted Lunges

**Eating-Plan/Macros:**

Just now making the switch to caloric surplus from deficit.  Will do CKG to protect muscle during the training.

50/40/10 -  Protein/Fat/Carbs (subtracting fiber from net-carb-count on veggies).


**Question/Ask:**

I've read the FAQ and article here, but I'm having trouble translating this into a practical plan for myself.  I'm trying to create is a calendar for myself (i.e. Eat X Grams of X carbs on X day, simple/complex, pre-post workout… X day(s) are ""carb up"" days, eat X amount on those days, etc.).  Just hoping to save some time if someone already did this and can screenshot me an example.  I'd really appreciate it.

I recently had a small (3 months . . . denial) hiatus from lifting due to a bit of life and moving. On March 6th, the day after my ketoversary I decided to kick myself in the ass and get back in the gym. With a new resolve and a mission to do some physical activity 7 days a week (6 in gym 1 running) I headed to my local Iron Temple. The only problem . . . I had forgotten my grip issue.


You see, I learned last year that if I tried to do multiple reps of 265lb on DLs I would feel the bar slipping, rarely getting past 4. This problem persisted when I returned to that weight and threw this huge wrench into my new found ambition. I resigned myself to attempting once again fix this issue and not being able to progress, until this week.


Tuesday rolled around and I read my workout sheet, DLS. ""Great, awesome, more dissapointment."" I could not have been more wrong. (On an unrelated side note, it was actually Romanian Deadlifts. I read it wrong, but am glad I did.) 


I have been having some great success with 5x5 so I decide to bench wave loading for the week. I load up 225, hit the set and put it down. No problem. 245, set, down. ""Huh, that was easier than I remember."" I start to get pretty psyched in my head, putting 265 on the bar and telling myself I won't drop the bar. 265, set, down. ""I just . . . What?"" At this point my mind is racing. ""Was my grip issue just in my head?"" I load up 275, and am frantically texting TheBraken excitedly with the news. I have to see if I can match my old PR from before the hiatus. Lift, down, no issues. ""How far can I go?"" 285, up, down. 295, up, down. The grip isn't feeling the best but I am doing it, my weak ass hands be damned!


I load on 305 and keep sending texts excitedly. He told me to try doing two quick reps at 295 but I have 305 loaded already, I can't go back. Lift, hold, feel my bastard of a left hand weakening but hold for about 2 seconds and down. Walk away feeling triumphant and with new vigor.


Now is when we get to last night, the real victory as far as I am concerned. Thursday is actual Deadlift day, and is when I realized I should have done Romanians on Tuesday. Whatever, it was a great day! Start at 225, 245, 265. Breeze through em, 5 each. Put on 275 slightly weary that Tuesday was a fluke. Nope, 3 reps and down. Happy with how my grip did, I load up 295. Taking TheBraken's advice I do two reps, and am satisfied with how my grip held out. Time to match 305. Lift, drop. ""That wasn't too hard."" Throw on two 5's and I am at 315. This is the dream for me. 3 plates, *3!!!* But I couldn't stop there, I did it, but it wasn't enough. I used chalk for the first time, I felt like a real weight lifter for the first time. I couldn't stop until it felt impossible to go further, that meant 325. It was slow, it was a bit loud, but I will be damned if I didn't do that too. I stood there, 325 pounds in my hands absorbing the moment, my left hand crying looking to give out on me at any time, but I couldn't let it go. I know it was more like 5 seconds, but it felt like forever. Go forth brothers, and lift.



TL;DR Crushed my DL PR by 50 pounds in the span of 3 days.

I would not recommend to a beginner trying to bulk with TKD or CKD.  These are all great diets that I have used and had success with (while cutting), but I have some issues with using them to bulk.  

1.  When you bulk, you need to be eating a caloric surplus, something which is hard to do on keto because fat and protein leave you feeling satisfied for longer, which is good if you're trying to lose weight, not if you're going to gain.  

2.  It is very expensive to eat as much protein and fat as you need on these diets while bulking, whereas carbs are cheaper, therefore more economical.

3.  Most important of all:  Your body does not burn fat while exercising.  You need glycogen in your muscles, which comes from eating carbs.  Targeting your carbs around your workout, or loading up for a one or two days per week can be sufficient, but unless you are experienced, your chances of doing this incorrectly will be high.

I can't stress enough how much I love Keto.  This diet quite literally changed my life, and now that I'm doing bodybuilding (not competitively, mind you) I use TKD as my go-to diet for cutting, but I would never consider using it to bulk.  I've tried both TKD and CKD to bulk, and the results I saw with those diets compared to just a straight 55/20/25 bulk with a 500 calorie surplus.

I've been eating keto since August last year. Have lost 24kg since then (53lb). I started weight training less than a month ago, and since then I seem to be tired all the time.

I generally do three half hour sessions per week, with up to 3 half hour cardio sessions as well (usually more like 1 or 2 at the moment though, my schedule is crazy at the moment and I'd rather prioritise strength training over cardio).

Since I added weights to the mix, my weight loss has sped up significantly (after a plateau of a month or more). There is still a bit of fat around my waist I'd like to lose  if I can, just because abdominal fat is correlated with disease (etc), but I'm pretty close to where I'd like to be so I don't particularly need to be losing fat this fast. I'm more interested in building strength and muscle.

I understand that strength training &gt; cardio for weight loss, and it's pretty obvious to me that strength training is responsible for those changes recently. It's the tiredness I'd like to address. I am feeling tired a lot of the time, like I want to go back to bed and sleep. I'm generally getting about 7-8 hours a night (like I said, crazy schedule) but my quality of sleep is better than it's been in a long time.

I usually eat about 1400cal per day (without exercise), which is deficit of about 200 according to the ketogains calculator spreadsheet. I go for 60/35/5% fat/protein/carbs. I tend to eat more on days I exercise, but not much more - maybe 200cal. 

Thoughts? I'm considering options like - maybe half a banana before I do a training session (dunno if that's reasonable given I'm still a beginner lifter?), trying to find more sleep time, eating more calories in general. Or is this just a period of adaptation, that will improve as I get used to my new routine?

Looking for some tips and a critique of my plan. In short, I lost 100lbs from keto which was just diet alone in just over a year (24yr old male, 6'2"" 360 to 260). That was kind of my phase 1. I'm now moving into my phase 2 which involves working out. I have a gym membership and have been quite active in there for the past few weeks. My main goal is to continue to lose fat while building more muscle. Fat loss is the priority over muscle gain. My diet is pretty stable and pretty hardcore keto (typical day is probably around 2500 cals, 65F/30P/5C). I drink virtually all water all day (I have an occasional Michelob Ultra or Coke Zero here and there but it's rare).

**What I've been doing so far:**

* I've read that LISS cardio is preferred. I've been doing 60 minute treadmill sessions keeping my HR around 130. I've been doing this at least once per day with the occasional skip. Sometimes twice a day.

* I've also been doing mainly chest and shoulder targeted weight training. My gym is usually really busy when I go so getting free access to weights (which is already kind of limited) can be tough. But I do have a dumbbell set at home which I use for a morning workout every few days. My routine usually involves about 30-45 minutes of (all dumbbell) benching, curls, rows, extensions, etc.


**What my goals are:**

* Quit smoking (DONE - 8 days out and feels amazing)
* Get down to 199.
* Build some solid muscle and start losing my man boobs.
* Run a 9 minute mile by the end of the year (which sounds slow but is pretty good for me given my almost 400 pound lifestyle)
* Have my future children think I'm Superman.


The motivation is there. I know a lot of people go into this kind of thing really passionate at the beginning but end up falling off. I'm serious about everything. I don't want to be the fat fuck anymore who sits around playing video games (which is pretty much all I did last summer). I want to go bungee jumping and hike up a god damn mountain. I want to pull kittens out of trees and save babies from burning buildings. I had my heart broken pretty hard a few months ago - I want her to see me and go ""damnnnnn I walked out on THAT? I'm such a fuckng idiot!""


I'm starting golf lessons in a few weeks which is something I always wanted to do. I would love to get to a place where tennis is also a possibility (I've always wanted to play, just never been fit enough).

I'm 6' 208lbs, 25% BF &amp; I've been following the standard keto diet of less than 20g carbs getting about 1700cals a day (more on my exercise days). My priorities are/were to:

1) Lose weight (target around 185)

2) Gain strength (increase pushups, curlups &amp; I'd love to be able to do pull-ups!)

3) Gain endurance (get my swim time down)

4) Improve my physique

Over the last 12 weeks I've lost just over 30 pounds I'm not sure how to go about getting the gains in strength &amp; endurance on this diet. I'm active at the gym &amp; at the start I was swimming 3-6 miles a week in the pool at a decent clip but I wasn't doing anything to improve my strength. I gave the Starting Strength regimen a go for about 3 weeks but wasn't able to make the posted improvements/increases and a lot of the forums point the finger at a lack of improvement at deviations from the diet plan in the regimen so I went back to my swimming &amp; joined a Krav Maga class 3 days a week for variety &amp; fun.

I just want to be physically fit, I actually enjoy doing keto &amp; I don't mind hitting the gym 5 days a week. I'm just at a loss as to what to do with myself. I've read conflicting information that says exercise can be good &amp; exercise can be bad on keto. The same goes for calorie deficits while on keto, as I know I'm staying about 200 below my maintenance calories. I also see all kinds of debates on whether or not it's possible to ""lose weight"" &amp; gain muscle. I do know that I've been tracking my BF using one of those handheld meters and while it's more than likely not accurate I have seen my number going down consistently over the weeks.

I watch this subreddit &amp; see a lot of ""body builders"" who are successfully getting swole and I watch the keto subreddit &amp; see a lot of people on their way to becoming skinny (possibly ""skinny fat"") and I'd like to end up somewhere in between. It's easy to do things I enjoy i.e. swimming competitively and my Krav Maga class now I'm just working on finding something I enjoy that can increase my strength. I've spent the past few days looking at bodyweight fitness subreddit &amp; am probably going to go down the convict conditioning path and see where that goes.

 Lifting 3 times a week on Strong Lifts 5x5 and doing Cardio for 30 minutes at a pace like HIIT on three days where I run at about 180 bpm for ~.5 mile then slow down until I hit 145bpm then push it back up. M,W,F - Lift. T,Th,S - Cardio

I've been doing this for a week now, is there any scientific reason why this program wouldn't cut body fat and produce muscle mass?

I'm eating about 1500 calories a day. I'm 6'1"" 260, ~28% body fat. ~190lbs lean mass. I'm asking because I don't want to waste any time doing something that isn't helping me when I can adjust it to help more.

My primary goal is body fat reduction and increasing strength and cardiac function.

Being on Keto has really changed my life in the following ways:

* Reduction in facial acne
* Healthier oral hygiene
* Trips to the physician are very rare (2 times a year)
* Awesome cooking skills
* Decreased blood pressure
* Less money spent on groceries
* No more seasonal allergies (in the spring and autumn)

Additionally I feel more alert, attentive, and a lot happier overall.  I started a modified form of keto in August of 2012 and then in March of 2013 I feel I really *began* keto; all in all i've lost 80 lbs.  Furthermore, several weeks ago my dad initiated my help when he entered the biggest loser at his workplace (and won! or should I say lost almost 20 lbs).  So far the only downsides to keto are that people will bother you constantly at how much more fit and healthier you are, and what your ""secret"" is.  Oh that and having to buy new clothes, that kinda sucked.

My Keto history - 
I have been on strict keto since 13-April 2013, and dropped from 172 lbs to 145 lbs (no cheat days at all), but over the past 3 - 4 weeks weight loss has slowed considerably (although not plateaued). I have been adjusting my macros as I drop weight. I eat about 1300 kCal at the % macros, which is less than the 1400 kCal above, plus I have been exercising about 300 – 400 kCal per day for 6 days of the week. Yet I do not seem to lose weight at the rate that MFP indicates at the end of each day. There is a barely perceptible drop during the past 3 – 4 weeks.
My goal – drop to 135 lbs (but I would rather go by 15% BF), without losing muscle (in fact I want to increase strength). I used to be a boxer at University.
My exercise routine is as follows:
Day 1 – Upper body workout - ~ 1.25 hrs – pull down, seated row, bench press, one arm lifts, chest press
Day 2 – Lower body workout ~ 1.25 hrs – leg curls both ways, seated push, calf raises, inclined crunches, weighted lunges, box jumps, box steps.
Day 3 – Cardio total of 35 min – equivalent of Hill training on the exercycle (1 min of high resistance at setting “25”, followed by 2 min of lower resistance at setting “10” – so I raise my heart rate to &gt;160 for 1 min and drop it to less than 140 for 2 min)
Day 4 – recovery day (maybe gentl-ish walk in the park for 45 mins with the wife)
Repeat cycle in the following days. I do not have a gym trainer.
Question – What am I doing right or wrong? Is my exercise routine advisable or do you advocate changes? Is cardio helping at all? Is anything I’m doing being counterproductive? I read so many conflicting posts regarding cardio vs weights. 
Thanks, much appreciate your comments.

I've lost a significant amount of weight. I started lifting heavy in January, and have put on some muscle, but newbie gains are over. I need some serious help retooling this diet so I can start losing more weight and making gains in the gym (for some reason I can't download the calculator on an iPad).

I'm a male, 5'11'', 87 kg with 25%+ BF.

Most days I'm eating 2eggs and 2bacon slices for breakfast, two chicken thighs with vegetables for lunch, protein and creatine mix after my workout, and a 3 oz steak with a romaine heart for dinner. I live in Taiwan, so food and supplements are quite limited in terms of western choices.

I lift four times a week. 

Monday - chest/tri
Incline press, bench press, cable crossover, dips, skull crushers, tricep extensions, dumbbell kickback, and cable tricep extensions (all are three sets at 12/10/8 reps)

Tuesday - back/lat/biceps
21 ez, incline hammer, reverse cable curl, overhead curl, preacher curl, pull-ups, hyper extensions

Thursday - legs/shoulders/traps
hacksquats, leg curls, extensions, press, hip abductors, Calf press, front db raise, power partials

Friday - back/lats/shoulders/trap
Military press, shrugs, db shoulder press, cable rows, front pull down, compound row, vertical row, db row

I'm limited in some of the things I can do as I have lower back problems stemming from a herniated disk in my lower back.

On off days, I eat less and do some sort of outdoor activity, such as hiking. Sometimes I will add 15 minutes of biking to my workout.

I got around 16% on each which I know is wildly inaccurate. Judging by the picture comparison, I would say that I am between 20%-25%.

Now that I am closer to my goal, I want to add lifting to weekly workout regimen. I am looking to use lifting as a way to help me reach my weight loss goals, and to gain strength in my legs for my cycling, plus gain a bit of definition in my upper body. I was thinking about lifting on Mon, Wed, Fri, and doing my cycling training on days in between. I would hit the gym before work, roughly 5:50 am, and be done by 6:40 am. I am going to take pre workout, something like N.O. Explode, and then take MuscleTech CellTech Creatine after. Possibly a protein shake with peanut butter after as well. Let me know your opinions on these items so far. Going into my questions now 

1) I haven't lifted since high school, so this is where I need some help. What lifts should I do for my workouts? I hear about SS on here, can anyone vouch for that, and provide a proper link to the workout program. I am looking for a well rounded program, not just arms and chest.

2) Is it fine to lift so early in the morning? Would it be better to eat my breakfast pre or post workout? If I know that I am going to need the extra calories on lift days, should I eat them before I go to bed, stuff as many in before I get to the gym, or eat them after?

3) Is more trips to the gym the better, or should I have proper rest between lifting days? I can make it to the gym five mornings in a row if need be.

4) My pre/post workout supps fine, or do you recommend something else? Am I missing something that I should be taking.

Thanks for reading this, and providing your input. I am a busy guy, and don't have a lot of time to be at the gym, so I am trying to get as much bang for my buck if you will. Let me know what you think, and please don't hold back. 

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice guys. I know feel comfortable in my approach, and can't wait to start lifting.

I've been on a ketogenic diet for four months. While I have been doing some lifting, my focus has been on fat loss. As such I have lost 30 lbs, I would like to lose about 20 more.

Anyway, I am now training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai, two sports that require a lot of explosive movement and definitely use up a lot of energy.

Per the suggestion of /u/semiotix (iirc, correct me if i'm wrong) i've been ingesting ~30g carbs before class, more if I plan on training for 2 hours ot longer. This has not disrupted fat loss.

Bearing all that in mind, I had some questions I was hoping you all can answer. You see, this past weekend I went to a wedding and allowed myself somr minor indulgences. A triangle of toasted focaccia, 2 glasses of champagne and two small roasted potatoes. Also it bears mentioning that I also ate many more calories than I would normally permit myself, but the bulk was meat and cheese related. Still many fewer calories than I would have eaten historically. Did some dancing too, of course, so i'm sure I burned quite a bit.

Flash forward to Monday Night bjj class. I had the best class ever that night, didn't get tired, felt focused, hung in there sparring with guys who usually would take me apart.

This of course now brings me to Tuesday morning weigh-in. Staying mostly true to keto apart from the wedding, intermittent fasting and training three nights out of the week, I... Gained four pounds? In a week? Wtf? 

So, here are my questions: 
1) Is it possible that I ate enough carbohydrate at the wedding to store up some glycogen, explaining the increased performance?

2) Is it possible that I retained some water as well, thus explaining the rather high weight fluctuation? 

3) I definitely had a few undisciplined meals throughout the week; it was all low carb, but on a few occasions the calories were pretty high. I normally eat at a pretty large deficit these days - so I think it is unlikely that I went over maintenance. Could I really have wound up with a 14,000 calorie deficit? 

4) Is it possible that my improved performance was simply due to a higher caloric intake, and maybe I should eat at a smaller deficit?

5) Lyle McDonald writes that ketosis can be maintained at up to 120g carbs/day. If eating a little more helps my athletic performance, is it a good idea to try bringing my daily carb intake up from the 25-30 range since I will burn most of it off while training?

One of my favorite things to do is early morning fasted state brisk walking. I was wanting to bump it up a little. Can I jog at around 5-6 miles / hour for extended periods of time (1 hr+) in the fasted state? How about in the zero carb but fed state?

My goal is single digit bf while maintaining as much lbm as possible.

On to the questions:

1) According to the mini-faq on the right, since I am new to keto it says ""carbs are not needed at this point"". Is this really the case? It certainly would make my life easier only counting 2 macros but I'm still stuck in my old way of thinking that I need glycogen for fuel in the gym.

2) Do I really need to count calories? Reading the standard r/keto most of them don't seem to count calories though I realize that most of them are losing fat because they're overweight and I'm losing fat to cut up...I'm just curious if this is the protocol you all follow over here.

3) At what point does protein become excessive? And is it the total amount of protein you take in or is it the amount you take in relative to fat?

Trying to exercise and get in shape, however, is another story. I've never been able to stick to an exercise plan. I found this sub and was intrigued, though. I found the StrongLifts 5x5 plan and it seemed simple enough to do, so I gave it a shot.

A retrospective.,KeepEmCrossed,15,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/18clxr/pics_and_progressvictories_a_retrospective/,"I'll try to keep things brief and full of pictures. [I was at my heaviest around March 2012 at ~188lbs](http://i.imgur.com/BvHqfCn.jpg). Started lifting, running and biking in March, although not much of any particular one. Went Keto in July. Gradually started being active more in all aspects. This is also when I agreed to run a marathon for my buddy who hurt his back (giving myself about 3 months to train). Kicked things into high gear. Marathon was cancelled thanks to Hurricane Sandy but [I still went out and ran 26.2.](http://distilleryimage9.s3.amazonaws.com/77dc5dde26b511e291d612313806edf9_7.jpg). After the marathon I continued running to a lesser extent and lifting at least 3-4 days/week.

I recently completed the [Empire State Building Run Up](http://distilleryimage7.s3.amazonaws.com/317c9dbe70ce11e2974222000a1fbdac_7.jpg), I'll be running the NYC Half in March, and the Jersey Shore Marathon in May. After that, I plan on focusing on lifting, along with some recreational biking. And I'm open to triathlons since I'm 2/3 the way there with my hobbies.

My weight dropped from 188 lbs to 165-ish by September and after that I just couldn't get any lower. Sure, there was recomping going on, but man, I wanted that number on the scale to go down. Stubborn bastard.

As the year rounded out, I knew I'd have to change something but hadn't figured out what that was. I went on vacation with my family and basically went on a five-day bender. I got back and decided to change something. On Jan 2, I started IF in conjunction with keto. It helped with discipline as I was only eating from 12-8pm every day. This was a big change going from my usual eggs and bacon for breakfast to coffee and (sometimes) BCAAs. I would still run or lift just about every morning, in a fasted state, and I didn't like it. Plus, I was falling asleep in my morning meetings so I said ""F this.""

[EDIT: I realized I left something out here. Jan 2 was also the first day I started using MyFitnessPal. I've used it every day since and it's made a world of difference. I cannot express how great that app has been for me.]

Then I came here, and thanks to the mods (especially /u/darthluiggi) I was able to learn about TKD, put together a nice stack, and modify my macros and caloric intake. Now, for the first time since the epiphany of keto, I feel like I'm starting to understand how *my* body works and reacts to what I put in it, and how I can get the most out of my time spent in the gym.

For the past two and a half weeks, since trading IF for TKD, I've felt better throughout my day, I'm having better lifts, and I'm far less dependent on caffeine to get through the day. The only part of IF I still follow is no eating after 8pm. This isn't a problem unless I'm drinking, but that's a fish of a different color.

[This is a comparison of Jan 2 to Feb 9.](http://i.imgur.com/sk6w0zw.jpg) So 3 weeks keto + IF followed by TKD. I'm sticking with TKD. 

Here's my new way of doing things:

Preworkout: NO Shotgun, BCT Oil, honey

Post-workout: Protein, BCAA, Glutamine

Additional supp's: creatine, carnitine, daily multi-vitamin, occasionally psyllium husk.

I always shoot for a caloric deficit, adjusting my protein intake from .8 - 1g per lb LBM on rest/running days to 1.2g on lift days. I expected to gain a few pounds when I started taking creatine but it's been marginal compared to the gains I've made in the gym and how I feel and look.

First a little history:
I'm well versed in the keto diet, last spring I lost quite a bit of weight using keto[\(here's that progress post\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/qs8es/6_weeks_of_progress_switching_gears_a_bit_but/). Then I switched to leangains over the summer and liked it overall but the carbs ended up creeping back in more and more. It wasn't a big deal because winter was hitting so I wasn't' too worried about being ripped. I've been trying to put on muscle, so I just made a concious decision to relax on my diet for the winter and lift hard and bulk up some.

That worked great, I've gained around 15 lbs in the past 8 months, but obviously not ALL muscle. [Here's a pic of me now.
](http://imgur.com/lwoLEPv)
I'm still trying to gain muscle but I'm shifting my focus to getting more lean, even if it's sacrificing some of my muscle building potential. I currently supplement with fish oil, creatine and fish oil daily as well as whey shakes post workout. 

If anyone wants to know the specific training I do or weights/reps I use I can include those as well, but I didn't know if it was necessary for this post.

Does a TKD seem like a good route for me? 
Would a granola-type health bar be a good preworkout carb source? I'm trying to find one thing and stick to that to keep it simple. 
Other than keeping my fat somewhat lower in my post workout meal is there anything else I'm overlooking? I may be trying to make this more confusing than it is, I tend to do that, lol.

Bonus: [Here's a food gallery I posted about a year ago of my own creations if anyone is interested.

I felt absolutely exhausted and crap for my work out that night and the next morning I was insanely bloated. Diarrhea, etc. I just had that feeling I would get when I would eat a whole pizza before keto and wake up feeling like shit the next morning. 


Now I'm not sure but I'm starting to think that maybe I am some sort of lactose intolerant. I've always had problems when going overboard with cheese and it gives me super metal breath as well along with super bloating.

I love numbers, and I'm trying to branch out to get numbers of all kinds related to diet, fitness, nutrition, and all kinds of crazy stuff like that.  Lately I've taken to checking my blood sugar like a T1 diabetic with no access to insulin (I think I took about 8 readings yesterday... I'm not diabetic).  Today I took at least 4, and while my fasting blood glucose is a beautiful 85 mg/dL, while exercising I found that my blood glucose peaked at at least 114 mg/dL.

I was wondering if this is normal.  

Most diabetics are advised to exercise to help moderate their blood sugar, and maybe for a diabetic the effect would not be the same as it was for me.  But I'm a little worried that this isn't normal and that it might be a sign of something wrong.  Before delving into some sort of crazy hypochondriac bed-wetting nightmare, I'd like to consult reddit for more information.

More thoughts...

My diet is very nearly keto, I just drink a little too much milk (probably still less than 100g carbs per day, and if I had to guess, probably averaging around 60 or 70 tops.  Otherwise boatloads of fat and about 150g protein.  Average calories is probably near 3500).  

EDIT: I stick to a standard keto diet, aside from the milk, really.

My workout plan is very heavy weights with a light and short jog to warmup.  So today for example I did 3 sets of overhead press at nearly maximal effort to get 5 repetitions (I managed 8 repetitions on my last set).  Then 3 sets of weighted chinups enough to cap me at 6 reps, only managed 5 on the last set.  Then I did 3 sets of dips, 18, 15, and then 10 (dips were definitely submaximal effort).  Right before the dips is when my blood sugar had peaked at 114.  After it read 108.  

I had a tiny glass of milk before working out and probably about 30 oz of coffee this morning before that.

LEG DAY
 
Dynamic Warm up 10 each of: walking lunges, shin grabs, walking quad stretch, Frankensteins (balancing on one foot, stretching out hamstrings), tube @ ankles-sidesteps 10x each way, tube @ knees-20 squats, tube @ ankles-20 crunches w/feet up, pull ankles apart at to of crunch.

• Ball/Wall Squats w/12.5# DB in hand  -Ball against the wall at hip/low back level.
 
• Deadlifts w/DB in hand-12.5# Keep back straight, stick your tush out, hinge at the hip. Do not round at your back. Weights should skim your legs all the way down and up. Keep a pencil squeezed between your shoulder blades, but don’t scrunch up your shoulders.
 
• Walking lunge with overhead Press-5# DB When your standing up, you press your arms overhead (OH).
 
• Curtseys w/upright rows-5# DB 8x/ea
• Side lunge w/jumpshot-no weight 8x/ea side
• Innerthigh ball squeeze in V-sit position 20x
 
• Finish with 2 more sets of tube@ ankle feet up crunches (20 reps)-you did one round as part of your warm up.

I had her formulate a workout that I could do at home with my dumbbell set. I do 3 days a week, arm/tri/delts, back, and legs. Next week my reps will be increased to 12. the week after that I will increase my weights. 

I'm definitely feeling my arms get more solid and the fat on my arms is jiggly when before it was all combined with my muscle which made it so I couldn't get a proper caliper reading. My body fat is around 30%.

I'm not seeing any movement downward on the scale. Is this due to noob gains? And when is it realistic to start to see the weight decline?

This is my first reddit submission so please bear with me and point out any reddit fallacies that I may commit.

**My stats first :**

Sex : Male

Age : 28

Starting weight (May 2012) : 166 kg (366 lb)

Current weight : 127kg (280 lb)

BF% : Hard to say, between 35% and 40% I'd say. It's deffinitely beyond the point of ""don't worry about estimating your BF%, just try to lose as much as possible"".

Goal weight : 85 kg (this is not set in stone, just a number from the end of high school when I thought I looked normal).

Do I lift : Yes. This is my 7th week lifting (impressive, I know). I lift 3 times a week and do a great beginner program that I researched on the internet and modified a bit to fit my noob needs.

How long on keto : Since the middle of March.

**Main part of this post**

Since starting keto I kind of naturally started doing my own version of IF. I eat breakfast some time between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. and then go to work (8 a.m. - 4 p.m.). I then come home and eat between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. (depending if it's a lifting day or if I have some errands after work). This has been working fine for me and since starting keto my fat has been falling off.
However, lately I've hat a few too many days when I've fallen off the wagon. Nothing too serious but it effectively stopped my wight loss. Now I know that this does not necessarily mean that I've stopped losing BF but being at my current weight for about 7-8 weeks isn't too optimistic.

So recently I've started thinking about incorporating a more srtict IF into my life. The main reason being the above one but also to improve the schedule my day and give me some more time in the evening.

So the plan is as follows : Wake up at 7 a.m. Work between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. 

Feeding window on lifting days : 

start : around 5:30 p.m.

stop : around 9 p.m.

Feeding window on non lifting days :

start : around 4:30 p.m.

stop : around 8 p.m.

Being hungry is rarely an issue on keto and I know I can pull this off.
The question here is : do you good people of the keto-lifestyle think this is a good idea ? I know that the ""classic"" IF approach (the one introuduced by Martin Berkhan) is 16/8 but I won't be able to do that.
Has anyone done IF with such a small feeding window (maybe it's not that small actually - I'm not sure).

I have read the FAQ and am wondering about implementing a ketogenic diet in season for sport.

I am 31, Male and in metric terms 182 cms and 112.5 kilograms.

I have lost a few kilograms here and there with a ketogenic diet at times but haven't stuck to it in the past. I am ready to give it a go, but one thing I am wondering about is trying it when the season is on-going. The sport playing is Australian Rules Football. 

I have 4 weeks left in the current season, which means 2 training sessions a week and a game on the weekend. 

Does any one have any opinions or experience in regards to whether or not starting one now would be a good idea or would I be best to wait for the end of the season to get cracking on the diet.

If I were to start it for the last four games of the season, does any one have any tips?

I would be planning a SKD straight up after the season for a few weeks, then moving into a CKD in conjunction with weights - mainly so that I can fit one day of eating in with my wife without any problems deciding where I can go on this diet, but also as it should help with adherence.

Skipping the rest of the season is not an option.

In the off-season I would also need to do some cardio due to the nature of the sport, but it's my belief that dropping weight through diet and weight training would be the best course of action.

Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I've got a couple of questions and I hope you all can help clarify some things for me (and maybe let me know how much I screwed up).  

Yesterday I went about my normal routine, had  my bulletproof coffee and a scoop of isopure zero carb in the morning, then hit up the MMA gym. Took my Muay Thai class, did 5/3/1 bench press day.  

On the way home, stopped at McD's for a grilled chicken bacon ranch salad. Once home, had another scoop of isopure zero and 2 scoops of BCAAs.  

Had a snack later on of some string cheese. Yum.  

Okay, so here's where I think I screwed up. Went out to dinner with the lady, had a couple of captain morgan and diet cokes and ignored the basket of bread on the table. For reference, we were at the cheesecake factory.   

Not too sure what was low carb, I went with what I *thought* was a good choice; bang bang chicken and shrimp, no rice. For those unfamiliar with the menu, it's a thai style dish with shrimp and chicken in a spicy peanut sauce. They also have a low carb cheesecake on the menu, made with splenda, so I decided to go ahead and indulge in that as well. Second mistake.  

I wasn't sure how badly I may have messed up, so I tested upon arriving home and had a positive reading for ketones. I even tested again later on, still pink.  

Today I researched it, and if what I found online is right, all told I had about 150g of carbs for the day. *shit.*   

Apparently the chicken and shrimp dish alone had almost 100g carbs even without rice and the cheesecake over 30.  *double shit.*  

I forgot to test this morning, but here are my questions: 
1) is it reasonable to suspect that I am totally out of ketosis now?
2) if I keep my carbs below 30g/day, how long should I expect it to take for me to get back in?    
3) How badly should I expect this to hurt my fat loss?    

Any and all advice is appreciated, really I'm looking to make sure that a) I didn't screw myself too badly and b) if I did that I have the right action plan to fix it.  

Thanks.

1. True or false: you can't gain/build muscle on a caloric deficit.
2. Is there any benefit to me lifting while on a caloric deficit?

I've got a problem.  I have a jiu jitsu tournament next saturday,  the weight class is 152.5 with my gi(about 4lbs) on,  and I am currently 152.5 without my gi on.  I was down to 149, but my body is revolting and for the last 2 days i've been 152ish.  

I am posting here, b/c based on my experience, and reading peoples responses.  r/keto and r/xxketo I will just get ""it takes time, don't worry about the scale,  blah blah blah""  I don't have a choice but to worry about the scale and I don't have time to wait for this stall/plateau/body being stupid to be over.

my stats:

F / 5'10 / 152.5 / 22% BF (according to my scale,  18-20% according to comparison pictures).  

I train jiu jitsu 5-6 times a week, and do kettle bells 2-3x a week.  

My kettlebell training is mostly HIIT sets,  varying between 8-12 sets of 40/20 or 50/10, or sometimes tabata (20/10).  I just mix it up.  

Jiu jitsu is a mix of technique which is low intensity and rolling (sparring) which is pretty high intensity.

Here is my [MFP Food Diary](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/MMAQueen).   I don't track my water, but I drink a big coffee,  4 or 5 giant mugs of tea, and 2-3 750 ml cups of water through out the day.  and when I train i go through 2-3 bottles of water.

Shark week isn't scheduled for almost 2 weeks so SHOULDN'T be a factor.  

I have been ketoing since Feb 19th. With a one or two mega cheat days, but none in the last couple weeks. 

So,  what should I do?  Any tips/tricks to force my idiot body to where I need it to be?   

Thanks!

Some tips/guidance please?",cAtdraco,12,0,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1b5r20/i_keep_undereating_by_accident_especially_protein/,"I would really love some help with this, if anyone has some thoughts to offer.

First, [here is my ketogains spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bz_Jokeqblz7T2dzZUNXd2t4OVU/edit?usp=sharing) for some context.

I workout 4 days/week most weeks. 3 weight sessions (30 minutes - 1 hour, depending), 1 swimming (1-2km breast stroke). On at least one or two of those weight sessions, I follow up with half an hour of cardio (usually treadmill or bike). So I guess basically 2-3 cardio, 3 weight sessions, condensed into 4 sessions overall.

I have made the call: there's a little bit of fat left on my abdomen I'd *ideally* like to lose, but at this point in time I'm comfortable with my general size/weight and would prefer to focus on building strength and muscle. Whatever happens to body fat or weight at this stage doesn't really matter to me so much. 

I am finding it difficult to eat enough protein: the days I manage it, I have at least one and sometimes two whey protein shakes. But more than that, I'm often accidentally under-eating. If I eat fewer than 1600cal in a day (a rest day: more on workout days) I become ridiculously tired. Drag my feet around tired. Just wanna go to bed tired.

I am pretty sure this is all down to caloric intake, because if I eat 1600 or more, I feel fine.

I have raised my carbs on workout days to ~30g (basically I drink a smoothie with half a banana in it, or eat a punnet of raspberries because yum!), which I'm finding helps with recovery. Otherwise I aim for a minimum of 110g of protein (which is probably still less than I need daily, but it's a more achievable goal) per day, and I don't even think about fat. I try to get the protein in and let the fat take care of itself.

I feel like I'm eating when I'm not hungry so I don't get tired. (And when I am tired, I don't want to eat). 

So I suppose what I'm asking really is:
Do you feel like you need to eat more than you'd actually prefer to eat? How do you  manage that feeling?

Is it more important to get enough protein or enough calories? (I could probably manage to eat more fat, but I'm concerned I'd up calories at the expense of protein).

I was advised to stay in the SKD, but am spending a *lot* of time in the gym, and am hoping to see great gains. I was wondering - if I want to see significant gains *and* significant weight loss, can this be achieved with the SKD and supplements? Should I consider a switch to CKD soon?

I've already decided to get zero carb protein (an obvious, if pricey, choice), but have been on the fence with creatine. I know it causes mass gain through water retention, but I'm not really worried about water retention. I'm concerned with *fat* loss. Is a creatine supplement something readily compatible with keto? Are there any other side effects I should know about involving creatine with keto, or creatine all alone?

I also have been considering a thermogenic. The one I'm so interested in is called [PharmaFreak Ripped Freak](http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12427590). A friend of mine is on it (he's in great shape), and recommends buying it before pretty much any other supplement. After reading a few of the reviews on GNC, I was sort of sold. Does anyone have any experience with this or similar formulas? 

After a bit of looking (and some more reviews), I ran across [PharmaFreak's Amino Freak](http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=12144565&amp;lmdn=Brand&amp;cp=3593186.3984491). I was thinking of using this to increase my training frequency, so that I could start condensing my training schedule to accelerate my mass gain and weight loss. Does anyone else use an amino/post-workout recovery supplement? Anything a ketoer should know?

Are there any other supplements I should consider (or even totally avoid)? 

I'm looking to invest money into the time and effort I'm investing in my body, and want to know what generally works best for the keto diet. I'm putting in about 2 hours a day at the gym, and I want to capitalize upon those two hours.

I've been at it since January 2nd of this year and have had great results (down 24 lbs).  I've also got my ass back to the gym the past two weeks to ramp up the weight loss process. Roughly 75 pounds more to loose till my final goal.

Over the past few days I was trying to find a routine that would best fit my weight goals.  Right now my goal is to do a mix of cardio and lifting that will maximize fat burning.  Adding muscle, size, and strength is great; my priority is **fat burning**.  

It seems like HIIT is where the rage is and maximizes fat loss, I also read briefly on LISS. It seems like most of the studies show that HIIT is more effective and eats up less of your time.  For example last night on the elliptical I was cycling between higher intensity (1-2 min) and then lower intensity and watching my HR for the cycle times.  My HR was 160's during the intense cycles and then back to 140's during the less intense cycle.  I'm limiting my cardio to 30 min, and its done after my lifting. 

When googling around it seems that everyone and their mother has their own interpretation of what HIIT is and suggested routines, and its even more varied when you check out HIIT lifting routines.  Some say 3 sets 10 reps, 2 sets 15 reps, etc etc.  Its quite confusing.  For the lifting side of things I kept my rest periods between sets to 60 seconds, doing a minimum of 10 reps and doing 3 sets + 1 warm-up for each muscle group. I worked up a good sweat during my lifting session, when I hopped on the elliptical before starting cardio my heart rate was in the 130's already. 

I'm shooting for a 3 day lifting program right now because that best fits my schedule. So Gym days are Mon/Wed/Fri with an additional cardio done on Sat or Sun.

Any suggestions / feedback / links / examples etc would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

BTW I checked out the FAQ/Wiki here, it seems like its a WIP.

Been on keto for a few months now, and it's been terrific. I'm nearing the 100 club which is very exciting, as it's been since middle school since I've seen that number (I'm a HS senior now). I've also read The Six Pillars of Self Esteem since keto...life changing book.

To explain my situation thus far, I was doing Doug's 6-Day Cutting Routine and playing ice hockey (season has ended now). I messed up my shoulder a few weeks ago, haven't been able to lift since. Been doing theraband rehab for a week now, hopefully only another week or so until I can lift again. Added an hour of cardio a day now that hockey is over.

The thing is, I'm running out of time. I have 45 lbs or so to lose (might want to get down to 150), and about 14 weeks left until my senior prom (goal here is to look bangin' for prom and last summer home). I've been doing 600-1000 kcals, a 600-700 1-hour cardio session, and can tell I am losing strength. I'm also taking multivitamin, fish oil, and OxyElite (switching to Super HD soon). I lose about a pound a day when I maintain this routine. But again, I feel myself losing strength.
I was thinking of maintaining this current routine (600 Kcal, 600-700 cardio burn, OxyElite/Super HD) until I get to 150-160, and then upping everything and lifting for gain instead of cut.

Thoughts? Concerns I should have? Other methods?

My question is this, for someone with ZERO gym experience, low fitness level, and poor coordination, where do I start in putting together the most effective weekly fitness schedule, much less, an actual daily routine for when I go?  Does anyone have either an internet resource that can lay it all out for me OR advice of their own on how to get the most effective workout?

PS-My goals are to track how much I can lift. I have no qualms with heavy lifting (eventually) and actually look forward to making and achieving lifting goals once I understand that basics and can work my way there.

TL;DR: Death fatty with no gym experience wants the most bang for her buck.

If you're stalling, and your diet isn't working for you, make ABSOLUTELY sure that you're getting enough water and that your daily salts are adequate.  You need to follow the WHOLE diet, not just the food part.

Being hydrated makes a HUGE difference in lifts and workouts.  It also will prevent you from retaining water, so your weight isn't fluctuating like a yo-yo and you don't get bloated.

It's absolutely necessary to drink enough water when you're slamming protein back.  Proteins are AMINO acids which means that you'll need to get all that Nitrogen out of your body to prevent fun things like organ damage and gout.  Your kidneys are happy to provide that function, as long as you're hydrated.

The keto diet is dead simple and it WORKS.  You can gain muscle on it as long as you're lifting heavy and eating enough protein, with minimal carbs (after workout/recovery carbing is likely the best way to maximise gains, but I haven't gone into the biochemistry/physiology of muscle repair to say so authoritatively).

The number one question to ask yourself before posting about problems is: Are you hydrated?

Fell off the keto wagon following a car accident, gained back about 10 pounds.  Back at SKD since July 2, lost 5 pounds in the first week and a half, have been stalled out in a 1 pound range ever since.  (Even shark week doesn't take me above or below that range.)  Right now my training schedule has a couple of days a week that are challenging and one day a week (Monday) that is flat out HARD!  I'm trying to learn straps which is a discipline that few women can even do and it's brutal... by far the hardest class offered at my school.  Think muscle ups and rings work.  

So... after a few weeks fierce DOMS and severe fatigue after Monday training, I decided to try the TKD thing yesterday.  I ate normal SKD until about 30 minutes before my 7pm class when I had a mexican popsicle (yum!), and after class I had sugar sweetened kefir &amp; a lara bar.  Then when I got home I had a handful of plantain chips, iced my wrists, stretched &amp; went to bed.  Total net carbs: 110g, total calories still at a small deficit.  

Class was brutal, I didn't feel any improvement in performance from the carbs, but it's somewhat above my fitness level and I'm reaching, so that's not surprising.  This morning I woke up, still in that 1 pound range (at the top of it, but essentially no difference).  I don't feel bloated, I didn't gain a bunch of water weight.  Ketostix indicate I'm either out of ketosis or just *barely* in.  I'm not hungry for breakfast yet, otherwise I feel fine &amp; normal.  

I'm kind of wondering if I did it right... conceptually, shouldn't I have stocked up my muscles &amp; liver with glycogen and bloated up a little bit?  Not that I'm complaining, but this is uncharted territory for me and I'm not sure.  Also, how do you guys handle a carb up if you train late at night... I'm not a super big fan of eating in the evenings, since it seems to trigger heartburn.  Would it work to carb up starting with my PREworkout meal (about 1.5 hours ahead) and then eat less POSTworkout?

I am a teeny middle aged female with a lot of muscle. (5'1"", 122lbs, probably about 18-20% bodyfat).

So I was successful in lifting every other day, hitting up the hotel gym. I also managed to maintaining my keto lifestyle for six out of ten days. Why only six out of ten days? Well, towards the end I started eating more carbs. It was mainly because keto on vacation is too expensive, but also it was getting boring eating the same meals most of the time. Typically for breakfast I had either an bacon and eggs, lunch was either chicken with asparagus or a ham and cheese plate, and dinner was either a mixed meat grill or a steak/fish with salad. Seemed like every restaurant we looked at had one of these options, and you had to look at many many restaurants to find one that had something keto on the menu. But after a while I got sick of spending an average €50 a day on breakfast, lunch and dinner (meat is damn expensive compared to bread and pasta). It just didn't feel worth it if I was bored with the foods choices. 


So I thought I'd eat more carbs and I comforted myself with the fact that the insulin should help with my gains, so I kept lifting in the hotel gym and hoped for the best. I didn't really notice any extra strength from all that glycogen, and if anything I felt like skipping the workout because there were some unwelcome results from eating carbs:


I had a bloated stomach and gas (carbs = smelly farts)


I felt nauseousness and had headaches


I felt hungry at night and first thing upon waking all I could think about was eating


I had oily skin, blackheads, and pimples



I've been back in keto now for a few days, struggling with the keto flu, but most of the above symptoms are going away. So I'm glad I hit up the carbs. Not only did it save me money, but it reaffirmed that my body prefers a ketogenic lifestyle.

* Approx 20 minutes cardio

**B Day**

* Squat 5X5
* Overhead Press 5X5 (80 lbs)
* Deadlift 5X5 (125 lbs)
* Pullups (4 sets to failure- but I can’t actually do any unassisted)
* Planks (3, adding five seconds each workout, currently at 45 seconds as this was a recent addition)
* Arnold Press 5X5 (20 lbs)
* Side Raises 5X5 (15 lbs)
* Approx 20 minutes cardio

**DIET**

99% of my **food** comes in the form of one of the following:
* An assortment of Oscar Meyer lunch meats with slices of Cracker Barrel cheese
* A bowl of lean ground beef with melted cheese, sour cream, and guacamole on top
* Spinach salad with creamy Caesar dressing
* Grocery store rotisserie chicken with slices of Cracker Barrel cheese


For my **drinks**, I have been drinking 3-4 gallons of water a day (because I’ve seen the best results with lots of water, but also to offset the 3-4 cups of coffee with Stevia and Heavy Whipping Cream I’ll have during the day). Occasionally I will have A&amp;W Diet Cream Sodas or, when I’m really weak, like 8 oz of Diet Coke at work.  


On the advice of some friends who are huge supporters of Ketos and Gains, I recently (like this week) also started taking two **supplements**: 
* Pre-Workout: Muscle Pharm Assault
* Post-Workout Protein: Gold Standard Whey Double Chocolate


**QUESTIONS**

Before I move on to my specific questions, any critique of what I’m doing now would be very, very appreciated. I’ve lost approximately 30 pounds already. Not as drastic as some of the pictures I’ve seen here but 10 lbs/month is definitely nothing to sneeze at!

***Workout***

1). Weightlifting (and going to the gym in general) went from something I couldn’t stand to something I now can’t get enough of. I am still very much a novice but I find it therapeutic and want to shoot for a 6 days on/1 day off split. Can you suggest anywhere I can go to research something like that? Everywhere I’ve seen relies on the assumption that when you start you only want to go 3-4 days per week and then when you get serious you move up to heavier days, but what about if I want to get serious early, when my lifting doesn’t quite match up to my work ethic?

2). Any suggestions about how to step up the amount of work I’m doing with arms, chest, and (especially) shoulders? This part of my body is exceptionally weak comparatively. Arnold press, side raises, and tricep pulldowns were all late additions to try to remedy this but I would appreciate anything you’ve got. 


***Diet***

1). I have been exclusively doing SKD but the same friends who suggested the supplements suggest I switch to TKD by simply having a handful or gummi bears right after my pre-workout and before my post-workout supplement (i.e. within 20 minutes of the beginning and end of the workout). On the FAQ it says Nerds are good so I assume these work the same, right? Do you think switching after only four months when I’m still quite heavy is a good idea?

2). I’m confused and can’t seem to get a conclusive answer about how much vegetables I can eat. I would like to integrate a lot more vegetables into my diet. Is too much Broccoli/Cauliflower/Spinach/Kale a bad thing? 

3). The Gold Standard 100% Whey I’m using is a protein Isolate. My friend originally suggested I use Evo Pro because of the Casein, but they didn’t have it where I was trying to buy it. Could I mix in a few ounces of Heavy Whipping Cream for the Casein, or should I use milk? And is that a good idea or is Casein not really necessary?

***Misc***

1). What’re your favorite workout songs? I’ve got like 70-80 songs on my playlist but I’m starting to get tired of them. 

2). Do you know of any books/websites where I can read *a lot* about Keto and working out? I have read everything in the sidebar but am looking to really get a good, holistic grounding in this stuff and I don’t want to just grab some shit and run to far with bro science. 

3). How’re you doing today? Thanks for everything if you’ve read this far, even if you’re not going to type anything. I really, really appreciate this community and all it has taught me already. Thanks in advance for any tips you can give me and I can’t wait to progress enough to seriously contribute. I’m in the best shape of my life now and I only see it getting better.

I was speaking to my friend who is a personal trainer and he told me not to bother lowering my calories because it will slow down my metabolic rate and store whatever calories I'm taking in as fat (broscience?).  I don't think he knows about keto because he was suggesting eating meals with fruit, oatmeal, brown rice.

I've been a lurker for my entire life, by I created this account to make the final plunge into a better life. Help me out!

I've read through everything on the side-bar, but I'm still very hesitant to start mainly because I'm not 100% sure if this will work for me and what I want to do.

If I get the reassurance, I want to start keto this very moment. However, my only doubts are with my exercise plan. 

Typically, I've done the 30/30/40 diet with carbs/fats/protein, but keto has intrigued me to the point where I want to give it a shot. When on this 30/30/40 diet, I would exercise A LOT. Meaning I would go to the gym at least 6/7 days and do 30-40 minutes of elliptical training on rotating intervals AND lift weights 4-5 days a week. Doing this would result in about 20-25lbs. lost in 2.5-3 months. However, because I am a college student, I would regain all if not more of this weight during the school year and then lose it again in the summer. Well it's summer time, and I'm making the choice to stick to a plan for as long as it takes. I currently weigh 255 lbs. with a goal weight of 170 lbs.

I've come to /r/ketogains to get answers to these questions:

- Can I maintain this type and frequency of exercise?
- Is exercising that much even good for me?
- If I understand correctly, because I am only about to start keto, I just follow the regular diet plan because my body is still adapting. Is this correct?
- I like exercising because it makes me feel awesome, is keto the wrong diet to have high frequency exercise plans?
- I've read Tom Venuto's Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle (not sure if anyone is familiar with this), and he has always endorsed the 30/30/40 diet as the most natural, healthy, and successful diet. Can keto harm me and is it worth it?

Motivation isn't a problem for me right now, but I need to know I'm not destroying my body by going on this diet. Thank you guys for inspiring me to take on this challenge, hopefully I can make y'all proud!

If there is any more literature (i.e. websites, threads, etc.) you guys could suggest, that would be fantastic!

1367423116.0,8,self.ketogains,1dhiw9,Gym Anxiety - my expereince,nothingtoseehere28,10,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1dhiw9/gym_anxiety_my_expereince/,"I wanted to share my experiences getting over my anxiety in the gym (or at least working on it) in the hope of giving others a bit of a boost and perhaps helping them make the step to get into the gym. 

First of all, when I stopped being fat and lazy, I was very weak. I could hardly carry my kids around (they were 2 and 4 at the time, 20-35lbs). After being chronically sick for a year I decided it was time to start moving and get healthy. I started at home with body weight movements and then once I built up some strength I was ready to hit the gym. 

I realized that at that point I was physically stronger than I was mentally. The idea of picking up a barbell was much harder than the physical act of picking it up. Regardless of how much I read or how many youtube videos I watched or how much I practiced my form, I was sure I was doing it wrong and going to somehow hurt myself. 

However, instead of giving up, I just took things slowly. Very slowly. I started with dumbbells (somehow less scary than a barbell) and went slow. I didn't go til failure, I didn't use the heaviest weight I could handle and I often finished my workout well before I should have finished my workout. Probably not so good for physical gains, but it really helped me mentally adjust. 

I'm well behind where I had hoped I'd be at this point (partially because of going so slowly, and partially because I took 4 months off training), but when I go into the gym now I don't feel out of place. I don't feel like I don't belong or I'm doing it wrong. I feel strong, I push myself, and when I'm done my work out it's because I'm done my workout. 

So I guess what I'm saying is fear of the gym isn't uncommon, whether  it's fear of the people or the weights themselves. There was a time when I would not go down to the weight floor if there were more than a couple people there (and honestly I still cut my workout short if it's too crowded). 

Some tips for getting over the anxiety:

* find out when the gym is least busy (early mornings, late at night and saturday/sunday afternoons my gym is practically empty. If I can't make that schedule work for me, I try to time my workout to start just after one of the fitness classes start and get out of there before the class is finished). 
* knowledge is power - if you feel confident in what you're doing that's one less thing to worry about. Understand the theory/form/science if that's the way your brain is wired. 
* Measure your progress against yourself. Even if it's slow. Even if you're only going up by 2.5lbs at a time, or just adding one more rep each workout. Don't pay attention to what others can do, just on doing more than you could before. 
* keep at it. You will get better. You will feel more comfortable. Your brain will adjust to the thought of picking up something heavy. It just takes practice.

My deadlift is also around 10-15 kg down depending on the day, while my press is holding somewhat steady.

I am as ignorant as it comes to both exercising and nutrition , most of the knowledge i have gained in these subjects 
come from /r/keto and this own subreddit.

After inputting my info in the calculator [this is what i got](http://imgur.com/1GneTSu). My body fat % comes from the measurement my scale gave me (small current trough 1 feet and that).

Im starting to do [this routine](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/dumbbell-only-home-or-gym-fullbody-workout.html) 3 days a week [using these](http://imgur.com/0P40ISA)(free sleeping cat) how many calories im roughly spending ? i do the exercises in there that i can (i dont have a pull up bar for example) so i end up doing 5/6 exercises of each day.

Usually i dont really break sweating (not like i would if i was running for example) but i do reps till my arms or abs cant do another rep then rest a bit and go at it again.

I do the reps with roughly 12 lbs or so and usually at about the 5th or 6th rep it starts to burn and then i power till the 8th or 10th , should i be using less weight and making sure i get more reps in?

Also should i be using different weight in the left arm (it wears out much faster than my right arm).

My plan is to eat whatever amount of calories you guys advice me to and then alternate the dumbbell weights routine i linked before and walking about 5 miles every other day.

So if im doing this and with the only goal of actually losing weight and feeling better how many calories should i 
be eating ?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as i said before i know nothing about this matter also English isnt my first language so i hope i made it all bearable.

Holy shit what a wall of text , im sorry.

I've felt irritable, dizzy, deprived, as well as tummy-rumblingly HUNGRY every day. My lovely boyfriend loves it, and I promised him I'd try it for at least two weeks. But so far it's like torture. 

I'm a female rock climber. [Progress pictures](http://imgur.com/a/nngln#3) for reference. I think I've only got about 5-7# of excess fat to melt off to start optimizing my strength-to-weight ratio. What do y'all think? 

The thing is: I value my glycogen stores, I need to be able to do power moves with my biceps, forearms, quads, and core. So I hear switching to TKD after a few weeks is good.

* How soon can I start doing that? 

* How many carbs should a lady of my size be nomming before a workout? Is a banana okay? Oatmeal? What about plain greek yogurt and a few raspberries? I really, really miss fruit and plain yogurt. 

**If it helps, some additional info on my keto so far:**


* *mean: 23g net carbs*

* *range: 13-29 g net carbs*

* *% of diet: 7-11% carbs, 45-64% fat (mean: 54%)*

* *Yes I'm taking magnesium and potassium and drinking tons of chicken broth.*

* *I have not given up coffee and never plan to.*

* *I have been extremely careful about correcting for labels that subtract out the fiber FOR me. (assholes!)*

* I eat 1,200-1,700 cals a day normally, depending. But on Keto I've been scarfing down more like 1,600-2,000, and I haven't even been exercising cause I pulled a groin muscle.

This, of course, was prompted by one of the trainers at my gym kind of picking my current plan apart, and I want to know where I'm going wrong and what I need to do to fix it; but of course the trainers will only give away so much free advice.  

With all that in mind, let me give you some background and tell you my goals and concerns as well as my current diet/exercise routine as it stands.   

Current weight: 240 lbs; (down from 308 in Dec. 2011)  
current body fat: ~25%   
height: 6'4""  
diet: standard ketogenic, ~2200 cal/day eating 3x per day  
current workout plan: Rippetoe's *Starting Strength* original novice program   
1rms (according to lombardi equation)  
squat 1rm: 210    
bench press 1rm: 179   
deadlift 1rm:  225

Goals: Lose ~25 lbs. body fat  
increase 1rms to an acceptable level for that body weight  
build noticeable muscle definition  

Now, here is where my conflicts come in.  
For one, the trainer said I'm not eating enough. This came as a bit of a shock, since I am trying to lose ~25 lbs. He also said that's my first mistake, that I shouldn't be worried about losing body weight, just losing body fat. So my question here is should I eat to gain and keep weight training without worrying about losing weight? Should I just build up muscle, keep eating keto but with more calories?  

My other question, one I've been turning around in my head quite a bit, should I change my workout to a split routine or something with a little more intensity? I was looking at bulldozer... would I be better off going for a hypertrophy-based plan? Am I approaching this all wrong?  

Am I way too concerned with weight loss when what I *really* should be doing is building up muscle mass?  
All constructive help/advice that will clear the cobwebs will be greatly appreciated, especially since *so many* people seem to have their idea of what works and what doesn't, what you should/shouldn't do, etc. and it's maddening. I'm hoping to get some straight info!

However I definitely experienced an increase in strength while taking it. I haven't taken it for a while, and now that I'm cutting (which lowers testosterone anyways) I decided to start taking it again.

The only problem with it was that it was pretty damn sour. Not super unpleasant, drinkable...but again not tasty at all.

**Well...just as a crazy idea I tried something today. I mixed about 8oz of water and 3grams of DAA + I added half a tablespoon of coconut oil and 1 packet splenda and blended it together.**

Delicious! Milds the sour immensely. Tastes like a mild lemonade. The coconut oil sort of creates a frothy topping that adds to the experience.

*EDIT: I found that there was indeed a small study with humans that found 3 grams a day increased testosterone by 33%. I'm skeptical of all studies and 33% seems like quite a bit to me. HOWEVER, once again, I have definitely experienced strength gains using it, and not simply placebo ...I'm talking noticeable affect. I recommend anyone cutting to give it a try, simply because calorie restriction can lower your testosterone levels.*

My current diet is roughly 2,000 calories per day with some sort of exercise 5-6 days per week.  The exercise varies whether I am at home or on the road, but it will normally include 3 days of weight training and 3 days of running.  

I am training for my second tough mudder and plan to work myself up to 10-11 mile runs with 2 smaller 3-5 mile runs per week.  I do not plan to run more than 22 miles per week.  I also will occasionally do 30 minutes of intervals as opposed to steady state running.  Right now I am running around 12 miles per week.

For lifting I am mostly following a starting strength type routine but I have substituted dumbbell lifts for bench press and ohp as I was having shoulder pain.  

My current numbers for my lifts are:

Deadlift  275x5
Squat  265x5
Benchpress  235x5
DB Bench  70x5 (just started and working on form)
Seated DB Press  60x5  (almost ready to move up to 65
Pullups and chins.  I can finally do pullups but I am doing them daily at home everytime I walk by the bar.  Probably 20-30/day
Seated Iso-row machine 180x10

On the road I will do circuits of dumbbell exercise (max 50 pounds).  I was thinking of switching Insanity as it would be easy to throw on my laptop and do anywhere.  I find it is nearly impossible to work pull exercises on the road.

I am worried that I may be undereating given the amount of exercise I am doing.  I am trying to get my protein numbers back up, but I think SKD got me in the habit of eating a ton of fatty foods. 

Sample diet while I am at home:

Breakfast/lunch:  
3 egg omelet, butter to fry in, a little onions and green peppers, meat.  MFP regularly puts this around 700-900 calories w/ cream for coffee.

Post workout:  2 scoops of whey in water

Dinner:
Ribeye Steak
Asparagus

MFP recommends I eat around 1800 calories per day to lose 2 pounds per week.  I have adjusted my macros and rarely go over 30g net carbs per day.

I have been thinking to add a pre-workout supplement that includes carbs before my lifting sessions and take in 10-30g carbs with that.  

Will that aid in losing the last 20-30 pounds of body fat?  Any advice you could give?",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,False,,,True,t3_18tyww,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/18tyww/m29_looking_for_some_advice_on_getting_to_sub_15/,

This is where I get confused. I've read (*ahem* skimmed) through the relevant material in the sidebar but haven't found anything that specifically answers my question. 

My personal trainer told me I should be eating carbs and well over 2000 calories a day. I told him I was on keto so that doesn't work for me. So now I'm confused... I understand that TKD and CKD can be useful depending on your goals (I'm still fuzzy as to how I'm supposed to know whether or not I should apply these...) but what really gets me is how I'm supposed to eat the necessary calories (particularly protein) for gains while also losing fat.

My day 1 was September 2011 and I weighed 310 lbs, (maybe a few more- I'm not sure.) I never participated in sports as a child and I've been overweight my whole life... so even though I see a lot of hating on p90x, it took me from being a complete sack of lazy, to exercising 6 times a week. Now I'm more than 30 days into my Round 5! I enjoy the repetition, and it's continued to work for me. I'm sure my results would suffer if I removed either keto OR exercising from my life.

I started out with these dinky little 5lb dumbells and bands, not getting into the muscle workouts because I wanted to lose weight, not get big. (hahah. I can't believe I used to think that way.) Now I go all out and am constantly trying to up my weights. Curling 15's and would love to be able to afford some 20's. All other arm/shoulder workouts get 10's and sometime 15's.

I've done multiple searches in the p90x, keto, theketodiet, ketogains, and fitness subreddits, and had no luck, even with archived posts from last year. 

I can find lots of women doing p90x, but several rounds? Nope. I only had two or three women respond when I asked in P90x. I know not a lot of people start on being 300+ lbs, but I figured there would be more... And none of those women doing 3+ rounds know anything about keto. 

I would post in keto, but I figured I would just be redirected to this board, which is fine. I was just curious to see other people (not just females) eating keto without carbing up and doing p90x. I'm still losing a lot of weight, (currently in the 190's) so I haven't considered carbs yet. Once a month I make chili with black beans, but that's the highest carb thing I will eat. 

Oh, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/Dz37V1p.jpg) me at 280ish for reference, and my [results](http://i.imgur.com/w6eOvNi.jpg?1) (NSFW-underwear/sports bra) Round 4 and the beginning of this one. Still covered in a substantial layer of fat, but I'm getting to finally see some ab/bicep/tricep stuff going on.

**TLDR:** What do you guys think about staying with p90x if it's something I really enjoy and am still being challenged by? I definitely enjoy increasing my weights as I go along, and can't see any other program being beneficial right now. Is increasing my dumbells/adding weight when they do anything squat-like/working on non-assist pull-ups/etc going to be enough to continue my muscle gains?

* Protein should not be loaded at more than 30-50g per meal, and getting to 50g should be done only after your body has had time to get used to absorbing/using protein.

* Protein shakes are, for the most part, instant protein sources which have high potential of not being absorbed properly.

* Protein from food (lean meats etc etc) is slowly absorbed into the body, which normally means no waste.

Now that my ""thoughts"" are out there...

The reason I started this thread was because I am trying very hard to not use powders or bars for my protein.  Not only for the reasons above but also because it is much more inexpensive to do so.  I am definitely having difficulty doing so though.  Eating chicken multiple times a day can get taxing and unappetizing.  The same also goes with Tuna.

I am very interested in finding out what others have done for food in order to meet high protein requirements without using protein powders or bars.

So for those who don't use powders/bars, what have you done to keep things interesting and meet protein goals according to your LBM and while maintaining Keto?

Any opinions are appreciated, I think this might be valuable for some people who lurk this sub.

Trust me, I've done my research. I've read about this diet extensively, and I've been following a SKD diet for a month now.

I've been reading all of the advice given to tons of other people in similar situations, and I'm just having trouble applying it to myself. 

So, allow me to give you my life story, current situation, and my goals. Then, hopefully one of you fine folks will help me along my way.

I'm a 27 year old male, 5'11"", and I'm currently 185lbs with a 20% body fat. I've been doing keto strictly for a month now. I've calculated my daily caloric needs to be 2480, and I've been maintaining a daily intake of 2000-2100 a day (except last night. I went like 2000 calories over my maintenance, on all Keto friendly foods. I wanted cheese, meat, and entire bag of pork rinds. No big deal, still in ketosis, feel great.) 

I hit the 65-30-5 macros daily, and eat a great mix of foods, including a lot of fibrous veggies. I take a multivitamin and fish oil capsules daily. Here's a link to my MFP log for a typical day. http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/destructsean?date=2013-01-21

A few years ago, I maxed out at 265lbs, and I lost most of the weight rather quickly. Where I'm at now, I feel almost skinny fat. I have extra skin from the weight loss, and I don't feel like
I'm putting on the muscle that I want to be. 


I've been lifting at the gym for a few months now. I'll do a brief outline of what I've been doing. 

M: Neck/shoulders. Shrugs, upright rows, cable machine, some super set raises. 

T: Rest, or cardio on the treadmill/elliptical for 30 minutes. 

W: Back. seated machine rows, seated cable pull downs, bent over one armed dumbell rows, bent over barbell rows

TH: Biceps/Triceps. Machine curls/tri ext super setted, hammer curls, one arm curls, skull crushers, cable bi and tri, dips. Mostly supersetted for time constraints. 

F: Rest or cardio

Sa: Chest. Bench (flat, incline, decline,) cable flys, machine flies, seated incline dumbell presses

Su: Legs. Squats, machine work, press 

Like I said, I've been doing this for a few months now, and I'm seeing definite strength gains, and some toning. I usually work out in the morning, fasted with a scoop or two of C4 pre workout. I've not been having any trouble with energy or maintaining an hour long workout while on Keto. 


I guess I just don't know where to go from here. I can see myself sticking with Keto long term. It's the first diet plan/life style I can say that about. I don't crave carbs, I'm enjoying what I'm eating, and I don't often want to binge. I enjoy structure, and have no problem eating set meals daily. 

I don't know if I could get down with CKD, because I've always had a extreme response to carbs. I balloon like you wouldn't believe. I retain water weight like it's my job, and it's an uncomfortable, if not painful feeling. 

I've been reading about TKD, but if I'm not having trouble with my workouts, and I feel fine throughout, is it worth it?

Am I overworking myself? I don't feel fatigued, and I enjoy working out daily. 

My overall goal here is to get my body fat percentage lower than it is currently (obviously) and obtain an athletic/toned look. I'm not looking for extreme bulk or body builder status, 
I just want to look good, and obtain that healthy look. 

Let me have it. What am I doing wrong? What can I do better? Where do I go from here? Kepp plugging along, or make changes?

Friend tells me to maintain energy and muscle mass, one carb loading day post workout every x amount of days of ketosis is necessary.

Here is my breakdown - i hope someone can see what I am messing up on to prevent me to getting into Ketosis regularly.

Workout days (rest days i have no issue being in Ketosis)

Before breakfast:
N.O. Shotgun 1 serving 
Workout for hour and half - 2 hours

After Workout:
ISO pure no carb (2 scoop) - 210 cal, 50 protein
Coconut milk (1 can) - 300 cal, 30 fat, 4 carbs, 5 protein
1 table spoon olive oil - 120 cal, 14 fat 

Breakfast (after gym)
2 ounces almonds - 360 cal, 32 fat, 12 carb (8 fiber), 14 protein;
1 ounce Harvaty cheese - 220 cal, 18 fat, 14 protein;

Lunch
Egg salad (3 eggs) - 210 cal, 13.5 fat, 3 carb, 18 protein,
Mayo (2 tbsp) - 180 cal, 20 fat
Prosciutto 1 oz - 60 cal, 3 fat, 1 carb, 8 protein,

Dinner
Tuna fish (3 cans) - 135 cal, 1.5 fat, 30 protein,
Mayo (2.5 tbsp) - 225 cal, 25 fat,
Havarti cheese - 220 cal, 18 fat, 14 protein

I end an average workout day with these Macros:

158 Fat
20ish carb (8 fiber)
155ish protein

I will wake up and be in Keotsis (using a Ketostick) but after the gym and using the NO Shotgun and ISO pure directly after, i find i'm knocked out!

If so what is the general guideline for CDK? I have seen people state that they eat 200g of carbs in a single (carb) night weekly and others eat in excess of 700g of carbs along 2 days of carbloading. I was wondering which is the best for someone in my situation?

1375778294.0,7,self.ketogains,1jsu1k,[Noob] Looking for some personal advice to take my lifestyle further,HerrVonStrahlen,8,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1jsu1k/noob_looking_for_some_personal_advice_to_take_my/,"Hi /r/ketogains!

I've read the FAQ and I've fiddled around with the Ketogains Calculator, but I find taking keto to the next step quite daunting. I have been ketoing for 4 months now. My starting weight was 340 lbs and, having lost 40 lbs, I currently weigh in at 300. I am male, and I am a little taller than 6'4"". I'm not living a very active lifestyle, at the moment (but that's why I'm here!).

My previous attempts at losing weight were all done without keto and with exercising 3 x 2 hours per week (of those 2 hours, about 30 minutes were spent doing cardio, the rest lifting weights). I must note that I still consider myself a beginner at lifting weights, so in the remaining 1,5 hours I took it rather easy. Anyway, those attempts never resulted in any noticeable weight loss, nor did I really feel any better. Those carbs, man.

So, back to keto: great results so far which I am *extremely* happy with. I must add here that the only macro I have looked after during ketoing is staying low on carb (aiming for around 20-25 grams per day). I have never even looked at protein and fat intake, since the results have been so positive. I believe my daily calorie intake lies around 1500-2000 (rough estimate, I think on average it would sit around 1700 or so), and I never feel hungry.

Anyway, I do not want to just autopilot my way to a healthy weight - I want to do exercise, too! Which is why I am now at the point where I *do* want to look at those proteins and fats so I can go back to effectively lifting weights. This leads me to my (rather broadly defined) question:

Should I start exercising as soon as I can, or should I wait until I reach a healthy weight first? My weight loss goal is to weigh about 200 lbs. I am asking this because I read in the FAQ that losing weight and gaining muscle at the same time is extremely difficult. My primary goal in all of this is to be healthy, not to look good, which is why so far I've felt that I should just keep ketoing the way I have until I reach my ideal weight.

Furthermore, I guess that in general I am not sure how to look after my macros in detail. Carbs are easy, as it's just one value. But as soon as I start measuring proteins and fats as well I fear that keto would end up being extremely difficult since I would have to eat so specifically. 

I hope you guys are willing to help me off to a good start. I'm sorry if this question has been asked a thousand times before, I'm just a little keto-insecure! Thank you so much!

Here is my current situation: I'm a fattie who wants to lose fat, gain muscle/strength, and develop my endurance, in that order. Wow, super original, right? But don't worry, I've read the FAQ, I've read through Ketogains, but I just never quite found what I was looking for.

**STATS**-M5'11"" approx. 235lbs, probably right around 30%bf, goal weight of about 190lbs. Ketogains calc states TDEE at 3200, but I dunno if that's right.  Eating between 2000-2500 calories a day, Stronglifts 3x per week, walking a few miles a few times a week. Work in a restaurant, so move a pretty decent amount per day, but I've done it for awhile, so I know my body has adjusted for efficiency, so i'm probably not burning as much as the calc says.

NOW, me and my best friend made a pact. We're both out of shape, and in order to help motivate us, we agreed to dress in slutty (well, manly slutty) halloween costumes this year. That gives me about 3 months to get in the best shape I possibly can get in so I'm not jiggling around 6th street all night. 

I know that diet is king, and I've spent the last month fighting to dial that part in, and I think I've pretty much got it by now, at least in terms of keto. I've lost maybe 10lbs since July (it fluctuates and my scale is not super accurate. Could be more like 5. Plus there was a whole helluva lot of cheating in July...). In addition, I just finished day 1, week 5 of stronglifts. Go me! So yeah, thats where I'm at now.

HOWEVER, I dunno if what I'm doing is the best way to go about getting as sexy as possible in the quickest time possible. I know, I know, consistency is everything, even if you have not the best program. So i've got that. This is a lifelong journey, and I know its gonna be a little slow. That's okay. I'm in it for the long haul. It'd just be real nice if I was decently attractive by then though. However, if I'm not, I'll just suck in my gut, flex a lot, and try to stay in dimly lit bars.

So my question is this: what would you recommend as the quickest way to look the best by halloween (i.e. achieving max sexiness)?

* 1.) Stronglifts on a mild calorie deficit
* 2.) Stronglifts with a mild calorie deficit plus 3 days cardio (jogging, sprinting, something like that)
* 3.) Some sort of hypertrophy routine with a calorie deficit
* 4.) Big calorie deficit, some cardio
* 5.) Literally anything else.

I am starting with a trainer today for a lifting. She's a former body builder, so I definitely plan on lifting heavy and asking her some questions, but I'm 98% sure she doesn't follow a keto diet based on her blog (lots of grain/carb/low fat posts) I'd like to arm myself with some info for today's workout!

My goal is to slim down and gain muscle. The ""you can't lose fat and gain muscle"" thing confuses me. I want to lower my BF to around 20% and be very strong.

1374459002.0,6,self.ketogains,1isasr,[Noob] I'm ready to take my keto experience to the next level. I could use some help and critique. [Warning: Long],aasukisuki,8,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1isasr/noob_im_ready_to_take_my_keto_experience_to_the/,"Hello Ketogains!

I've been on keto since the beginning of the year, with pretty good results.  I'm 5'10"" and have gone from 210 to 185 in that time.  I'm ready to start a workout regimen, and have come to ketogains for help!  I’ve been doing research, and I just want to get clarification, and suggestions.

I have a scale that gives my body fat %, which said I’m at 21.8%.  However, looking at visual estimation charts, I would guess that I’m closer to 25%, so I guesstimated at 23% Ultimately I’d like to get down to around 15% body fat.  Using the Ketogains calculator, I came up with 2 sets of macro #’s to maintain my weight.  Those numbers are:

Non-Workout Days:  2081 Calories | 27% Protein | 4% Carbs | 69% Fat

Workout Days:  2306 Calories | 25% | 4% Carbs | 71% Fat

Question Set 1:  I’ve read that you can’t lose fat and gain muscle at the same time, and I’m not dead set on maintaining my current weight.  What’s the best plan of attack to meet the 15% body fat goal?  Should I readjust my calories to the “Lose Fat” columns until I’m down to 15% body fat, and then once I’m there, adjust my calories to maintain weight?

As far as eating goes, I plan on maintaining what I’ve been doing for the past 7 months, except I’m going to be stricter about tracking using MFP.  I also plan on adding 2 cups of broth to my daily diet, as well as a magnesium supplement and a liberal use of nu-salt for the potassium.  I’m also planning on getting MCT oil to add to coffee, pre-workout, as well as some whey powder.

Question Set 2:  Do these steps sound reasonable?  Any suggestions on best time of day to workout?  I read that you shouldn’t eat a fatty meal after working out, so I’m concerned about working out in the morning, only to follow it up with a large breakfast.  I also read that MCT Oil + Coffee is good to drink pre-workout.  I imagine I should do this within 30 minutes?  Finally, should whey protein be taken before or after working out? 

Speaking of working out, I’ve done it before (did body for life a couple times), but I consider myself to be a novice.  I was hoping to take my experiences lifting from the times I was doing Body for Life and apply them now.  The workouts I was doing previously was 6 days a week, 3 days lifting 3 days cardio.  Lifting days were alternated between  upper body / lower body.  Here is the regimen I was doing previously.  These were done in a pyramid style, upping weights each set.  The goal is to max out during the last set of 12 of the secondary exercise.

Each pyramid looks like:

[Primary Exercise]

12 Reps @ base

10 Reps @ base + 5lb

8 Reps @ base + 10lb

6 Reps @ base + 15lb

12 Reps @ base + 10lb

[Secondary Exercise]

12 Reps @ base + 10

Here are the workouts I was doing previously:

Upper Body Workout:

[Primary] Dumbbell Fly 

[Secondary] Dumbbell Bench Press


[Primary] Dumbbell Bent-Over Row

[Secondary] One Arm Row


[Primary] Dumbbell Shoulder Press

[Secondary] Dumbbell Lateral Raise


[Primary] Dumbbell Biceps Curl

[Secondary] Concentration Dumbbell Curl


[Primary] Lying Triceps Extension

[Secondary] Triceps Kickback


Lower Body Workout:

[Primary] Beginner Squat

[Secondary] Dumbbell Lunge


[Primary] Machine Leg Curl

[Secondary] Straight Leg Deadlift w/ Dumbbells


[Primary] Calf Jump w/ Dumbbells

[Secondary]  Standing Dumbbell Calf Raises

[Primary] Wheel Rollout (no weights)

[Secondary] Bicycle Kick (no weights)


I do have access to a gym, but I’ve mostly been working out at home.  I’ve got dumbbells ranging from 5lbs to 35lbs.  I also have a treadmill, and wheel rollout do hickey.

Question Set 3:  Does the pyramid style lifting strategy work well while on Keto, or is there a better way?   Does it look like I’m covering all of my bases with these exercises?  Should I add/remove/replace any of these for maximum effectiveness?  Are the weights that I have sufficient, or should I look at purchasing larger weights.  I do feel that in the past the weights I have weren’t enough when doing lower body.

Finally, I’m open to any and all advice.  I’m really looking to make the most of my workouts, and achieve my goal as quickly as possible with the least amount of spinning my wheels.

I was so excited for a fun-filled yet cheat-free getaway but within the first 3 hours of being there I was done for. I know it may sound silly, but walking is almost always the source of my injuries. I did competitive cheerleading and gymnastics for 5 years and not one serious injury came from that. BUT I've managed to sprain and re-sprain the same ankle more times than I can count, break my pinky toe, and catch sciatica all because I am, essentially, bad at walking. So to the point, I stubbed my big toe on some uneven sidewalk. Ya it hurt, but for the first day it wasn't too bad, just a little sore. Yesterday I woke up with the thing twice it's size and swelling all around the top and bottom of my foot. I can't even wear a shoe. I made it worse by walking with this injury all day and now my ankle and calf are suffering from pain too. I was so upset about it the other evening that I got slightly intoxicated and ate a burrito...damnit. I've forgiven myself for the cheat, but the injury has put me down. I've been elevating it all day and all I want to do is go to the GYM. I can't not run and I just got a gym membership not too long ago. Prior to that I was doing Tabata and HIIT workouts at home, which I liked but being in a gym is a bit more motivational. ALSO, I just signed up for some personal training. I had my consultation on Wednesday and today was supposed to be my first day of a 16-week program. I loved the trainer and the workout we did, especially the TRX suspension training. I was so excited to start today! I just really want to continue working out. I know I can do upper body and core, but my trouble areas are my legs and butt. How can I train those until my toe heals? I know I didn't break my leg or anything, but believe it or not this injury really limits your daily activities!

I've been at a stall for quite a bit and my husband says it's because I'm not eating enough. So we went ahead and tried the KetoGains calculator since I am now ""moderately active"", I play competitive soccer 3x's a week and do Crossfit 2x's a week, averaging about 5 hours or so a week. Anyway, I inputted my numbers and this is what I don't understand:

1. **What amount of calories should I be eating when I DO exercise and when I DON'T exercise?** Under section 1 it tells me that I have a BMR of 1,326 kcalories, however, under section 4 it gives me 1,641 for ""calories w/out exercise"" and ""calories with exercise"". And lastly, in section 5 I see 1,389 calories. What calories should I follow? I say 1,389 with or no exercise but my husband says 2189 (maintenance w/ exercise). This is extremely confusing!

2. Are my macros ok? Calorie deficit of 25% seems manageable to me since I've been on Keto, but what do you recommend on my macros and calorie deficit? 

3. I just started Crossfit, this is my second week, and I feel a bit dizzy/lightheaded after the work out for about 20 minutes and then it goes away, should I 'up' my macros? Eat half a banana before? 

Note: Been doing keto for 6 months, lost ~30lbs so far (without exercise) and I'm just coming off an injury which is why I am now back to playing soccer and joined a Crossfit gym. 

Note 2: I used to eat 17carb/100fat/107protein=1387 kcalories with IF for the last 6 weeks and my weight has stalled between 134-137lbs.

3. Strict keto on days I don't work out. 

So TKD.

-What's the best way to do this if I worked out at 6am instead of 6pm? If I worked out at 6am, I'm thinking breakfast would be a protein shake with no fat, while lunch and dinner would be high fat, high protein.

* Current weight: 189lbs
* Goal weight: 168lbs

* Current body fat: 25%
* Goal body fat: 13%

Here is the general plan I've worked out from reading over the years. It includes 100g protein and 80g of fats, with minimal carbs, and resistance training focused on only core muscles.

**Diet:**

* Training - 20 minute jog
* Breakfast - 3 eggs + tsp oil + 1tbsp benecol + black &amp; red pepper + spinach
* Snack - Greek yoghurt + cinnamon
* Lunch - 1 tin of tuna + 1tbsp benecol + black &amp; red pepper + cucumber
* Training - (resistance training, see below)
* Dinner - 3 eggs + tsp oil + 1tbsp benecol + black &amp; red pepper + lettuce
* Snack - Greek yoghurt + cinnamon

**Training regime:** 5 sets 8 reps of each exercise. 

**Split:** Push - Pull - Rest - Push - Pull - Rest - Rest

**Push day:**

* Dumbbell Shoulder Press
* Dumbbell Bench Press
* Barbell Squats

**Pull day:**

* Barbell Deadlifts
* Dumbbell Leant-over Reverse Fly
* Dumbbell Lateral Raises
* Cable Lateral Pulldown

**Justifications:**

* I'm only working the big muscle groups because I want to be physically-able, rather than an a giant.
* I try to use dumbbells and cables rather than resistance machines and barbells, to keep all the supporting muscles working, rather than isolating any muscle groups.
* I generally stay away from red meat so I'm trying to get the fat from other sources.
* I've been advised that Benecol reduces the buildup of fat within the arteries, and doesn't conflict with ketosis.

I have spent a lot of time in the Keto subreddit tracking people's success and have also started my own transformation. At the moment, I weight in at about 94-95 kg down from 120 kg (19, 6'0, big build; aiming to get to muscular 85 kg) since January 6 2013. I have, unfortunately, not been able to keep SKD; I have had to just have a reduced carbohydrate diet compromising due to the food available to me as a university student that lives in accommodation that provides my food. 

My biggest concern is that my lifts are pretty low. I have been lifting for about 6 weeks and here are my stats:  

Deadlift - 50x10 (warm up), 60x10, 80x8, 85x8, 90xfailure (usually 5-6 reps). 
Squat - 50x10 (warm up), 70x10, 75x8, 80x5 (do not go to failure on squats). 
Bench - barx10 (warm up), 40x10, 50x10, 55x10, 60x5 (my bench seems low and I am contemplating doing smolov in the future to get it higher; friend just went from a 70kg 1RM to a 90kg 1RM in three-four weeks). 

Does this look okay? I know TKD is recommended for more experienced lifters, but will the added energy of carbohydrates increase my lifts around workouts (0.5-1 hour have some honey or something)? 

I generally do all these compounds and then use machines or isolates to work a particular muscle group, i.e. Monday chest day I do all the above compounds and then will do some inclined dumbbell bench, declined dumbbell bench and chest flies. I will do this 5-6 days a week with compounds plus isolating a muscle group. Is this overworking my body? My cardio is very minimal and is generally going for a 1 hour moderate-paced walk of the evening with a friend talking about philosophy. 

Any input would be greatly appreciated.

I started keto recently, im heading into week six, and its been going great. I've got a lot to lose still though (female, 5' 8"", cw: 208lb, gw: 160lb, lbm:135ish). My goals are to lose the fat involved inmeeting my goal, and building a healthy amount of strength/muscle, also to look damn good. I started a week after my buddy on keto and have been using the mfp app to track my intake; it said my intake should be 1200cal/day. All the caloric intake calculators I've used since then (ive been reading a bit to get a better handle on things) have said to intake a bit over 1600 cal per day for continued loss, about 1800 when I lift. ... Anyways, so for the first few weeks I was eating roughly 1200, since I was hungry or not energized I decided to up my intake to 1400 about two weeks ago. That fixed the hungry/not energized problem, usually I'm good somewhere between 1200-1400. I've been heavily focusing on my macro ratios and have kept my net carbs under 15 for the most part, sometimes up to 20. 

As far as lifting is concerned, I've lifted before, so I know my way comfortably around a weight room. I recently read the new rules of lifting for women and started lifting again about a week and a half ago to get back in to it. Anyways, I'm enjoying weights again and am looking forward to losing all this fat I've accumulated while gaining muscle :)

My questions are probably pretty common:
-how does it work, the weightloss/ muscle gain? Wednesday morn I was 205, lifted wed and fri, and today I'm up 208. I know it's foolish letting a few pounds bugger me up, but it sure is distracting. I took my body measurments and will start looking at changes there. If I've started building muscle, at what point will I see the lbs come off on the scale? 
-my buddy who's also on keto, as I mentioned, is not lifting and doesn't plan on lifting until closer to his goal. Is there some reason I should postpone building more muscle mass until my body fat is lower? Admittedly, this is my first time losing so much weight and hopefully the only time ill have so much to lose, but I'm under the impression muscle burns cals even when resting.. 

Any other advice is welcome, I'm still new to this. Thanks in advance for any and all help. ",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,False,,,True,t3_1daboe,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1daboe/question_about_fat_loss_while_lifting/,

I've used the calculator, but I just want to check with when I should be eating at maintenance, when I should be eating at gaining, etc. So here's some info:

age: 28

sex: F

height: 5'2""

weight: 112

bf%: I just got accumeasure calipers on Monday and it said ~27% (does that mean I'm skinnyfat?) If it would be helpful I can take a pic; I just don't have one ready at the moment.

My story: I started keto in mid-January at 130 lbs and made it to my goal weight of 110 a few weeks ago. I was also running, getting up to week 6 of c25k, and doing yoga. But then I realized that I want to be strong, not be able to run fast. I also want to bring my bf% down to more like 20. So a few weeks ago I started doing some light weight training, not really knowing wtf I was doing so much, I was just using a kettlebell and dumbbells. I upped my calories on exercise days to 'gain muscle' as per the calculator, kept rest days at about maintenance, and that's where I gained 2 pounds (no clue if it's fat or muscle because I didn't have calipers before and it's hard to tell). This week I decided to get serious and began Starting Strength (yesterday made day 2) and I really like it a lot and feel like it's actually going to get me somewhere.

I want to do SS 3 days a week as I'm supposed to, yoga 2-3 days a week, and then have 1-2 rest days -- or just 1 rest day and use the other day for some kind of other activity like bike riding or hiking or whatever.

So here's where I have questions. Do I use the calculator to determine how many calories to consume on each different type of day? Like I'd use a ""gain muscle"" count for lifting days, a different ""gain muscle"" count for yoga days, and a different ""gain muscle"" count on rest days as well? OR should I just consume maintenance calories or deficit calories on my rest days?

Here's what I calculated:

Lifting Days: 1630 to gain

Yoga Days: 1389 to gain

Running Days (I don't really run much anymore, but my husband likes to so I'm going to run with him sometimes): 1458 to gain

Rest Days: 1320 to gain, 1148 to maintain, or 1033 to lose

What do you think? It's just a little scary thinking about consuming surplus calories after I just spent 4 months trying so hard to watch what I eat and lose the weight to begin with; I don't want to screw it up and get fatter again!

Since about last november I've been following [this](http://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/dumbbell-only-home-or-gym-fullbody-workout.html) dumbell programme and in summer 2011 I somehow got into the habit of doing push ups 3x a week. So I have some muscle especially in my legs but also arms and chest. I would say I'm pretty fit now but still what seems to be called skinny fat - but with a bit of extra muscle! Will have to get some pics to show what I mean. 

So in feb I started up a CKD and stronglifts 5x5 to try and shift the last stubborn bits. I'm still used to doing the fairly intense road biking every day (just feel guilty if I go a day or 2 without it!) but is this now detrimental to the 5x5? How much cardio should I aim to be doing to complement stronglifts and getting optimum results? I normally do a 5-6 mile sprint (just go all out with as high an average speed as I can) on my lifting days, then try to do a longer but less intense ride on my ""rest"" days. Also I sometimes have to miss a day of stronglifts if I'm on a long shift at work where I don't have time before or after - usually get at least 2 days of the 5x5 in a week though.

Also been doing LeanGains for over a year -- always training fasted and breaking the fast shortly afterwards.

I've already been ""fairly low"" on carbs for the last few months but never completely eliminated them.

As per my understanding, for completely new keto beginners you need a few weeks ""induction"" where the body adapts to not need any carbs at all.

Some time back I hurt my back pretty badly, and was laid up in bed for a while.  I gained a ton of weight during that time, so to lose it I decided to start keto.  I've been virtually carb-free for about 14 months now.  In the first 12 months I lost about 30 pounds with no exercise.  For the last 2 months though, I've been using the elliptical for 45 minutes about 4 times a week, plus core training (essentially yoga) twice a week to strengthen my back.  I also do pushups (since they allow me to keep my back straight).  

For the elliptical I keep my heart rate between 130 and 155.  Here are my stats:

What I would typically do is a shake prior to running first thing in the morning that was mostly water, a combo of frozen strawberries/blueberries/mangos, and a scoop of protein powder (pure-protein plus French vanilla). I found that running on an empty stomach caused dizziness, but if I ate too much I was uncomfortable. Hence the shake. 
Post workout, I would just consume a lot of water and then continue with my day. If I was running after work I would have the same style of shake (water/fruit/protein powder)after the workout. 

I'm a total fitness newb and amazed that I actually ran a 10km (in 1hr 15mins) a couple of months back. I live in Japan so a lot of options for food aren't available to me and I still have a bunch of frozen fruit in my freezer that I just don't want to throw out. It's also finally starting to warm up again so I want to run outside but don't know if I should do something like I was before. Should I have a bit of the frozen fruit 30-60 mins prior to running and then a nice protein drink after? I'm looking not to bulk up (26F 79kg/174lb) but to fuel my running legs and be able to run faster and longer than I was previously. I think following something like TKD on the days I run is maybe what I should do, like I said, I have no clue and I haven't attempted a run yet since starting keto (it's been too damn cold outside and I just haven't gotten to the gym....). Any tips and advice would be great and I'm at your mercy.

I lurk this subreddit (as well as keto, leangains, fitness, loseit, etc) all day. Like you, fellow lurker, I'm under the impression that the combination of keto and heavy weightlifting is the optimal strategy for fat loss and body recomposition. Between the touted efficacy of programs like Starting Strength and the proven advantages of the ketogenic diet, combining both seems like a no-brainer! I have been doing quite well in my pursuit of fitness using both tools, but I seem to have hit a wall with my lifting as of late. I figure I should ask for help before this subreddit explodes in popularity (with tons of credit going to darthluiggi, who seems to rep /r/ketogains in every thread and always has spot-on advice - you're seriously a baller dude), so here goes nothing. Some stats: 

Before (340lb) / After (240lb): [2 Chainz? More like 2 Chinz](http://i.imgur.com/oYZgJ.jpg)

Most recent: [Why yes, I have been charting my progress by trying on things in Lacoste...](http://i.imgur.com/i7QjIfi.jpg)

Age: **23**

Sex: **M**

Weight: **240**

Height: **5'8""**

Bodyfat %: Honestly no idea. LBM could be anywhere from 150 to 180 lb. I was never much of a bodybuilder until relatively recently, so I don't have epic strength stores like some athletes-turned-fatties here. I did max out at 340 lb of bodyweight at 18, though, so I may have increased LBM due to that alone. I should probably have it measured with calipers at some point...

Lifts: Squat **250** (3x5) / Bench **170** (3x5) / DL **280** (1x5)/ OHP **125** (3x5)

Training frequency: **2x/week**, typically 3 to 4 days apart... was originally shooting for 3-4x/week, but long recovery times and inconsistent gym partners have knocked this down to a typical 2x

Goals: Cut down to 200lb/15%bf/abs/whatever, increase strength in the process (or at least retain LBM)
Other exercise: I work in an office, but probably end up walking a few miles a day within the building going back and forth between labs a such. Probably the equivalent of a typical day of walking between classes on a large college campus. Dead sedentary otherwise. 

Macros &amp; targets: **I do IF**, and usually capture my entire day's nutrition between the hours of 6pm and 11pm for a 19 hour fast. I typically eat **~1100-1200 calories/day**, ~**150g protein**, &lt;10g carbs, the rest in fat. The low-ish calorie count (compared to the values recommended by the Ketogains Macro Calculator) is my attempt at doing a modified PSMF - I found that larger weekend meals sometimes greatly encroach on deficits built up during the week, so I've increased my weekday deficit to near-PSMF levels in addition to exercising more stringent self-control on the weekends (this involved **quitting trees**, as they often caused binge behavior :( ). Despite the protein intake, I realize that this is still a very low calorie intake given my strength goals.

Food: Typical meals during the week look like this: chicken/lean ground turkey cooked in 1tbsp of MCT-laden coconut oil alongside spinach/kale/chard/whatever I have available, sometimes a can or two of chunk light tuna with some dijon mustard or other low-calorie condiment, sometimes a carton of egg whites. I rarely deviate from this list of foods; ""eat like a scientist"" etc. I go up a few hundred calories on Friday (typically a larger, yet still clean home-cooked meal like a Thai curry with coconut cream and tons of chicken) and will usually eat out on Saturday - [Sashimi Saturday](http://i.imgur.com/nTnLSqd.jpg) has been a [thing](http://i.imgur.com/2ms3qiw.jpg) recently, and I'm loving it :) - but these meals are, again, well-controlled for calories and protein. Aside from coffee, I almost exclusively drink sparkling water, save the bubbler at the gym.

Supplements: In the morning, I take a multivitamin, D-3, green tea caps, and occasionally black coffee. Later on in the day, I usually take my fish oil w/ dinner as well as 10g creatine (all at once on rest days, 5g pre-/5g post-workout on lift days) with the occasional day off. I am of the understanding that someone of my size needs closer to 10g/day than the typically recommended 5g/day, but I could be mistaken. I take magnesium before bed, and liberally salt my food with sea salt and Lo-Salt.

My problem: Between what I'm eating, what I'm lifting, and how often I'm trying to lift, I'm definitely selling myself short somewhere. I rode the ""newbie gain"" wave for quite a while, but lately I seem to have been hitting a wall with my lifts. A lot of the time, I'll put up a PR on a set of lifts (adding 5 lbs over the previous), only to come back next time and barely be able to maintain those same numbers. I started ingesting ~5-7g of quick-release carbs right before lifting (typically a 'fun size' Gatorade G2, 30 cals 7g carb) and this seemed to help for about 10lb on all lifts but I seem to have stalled again. 

My questions: Should I **up my calories**, consume **more carbs** (either a refeed or TKD), or otherwise **lower my expectations** for strength gains? Should I use something like Jack3d? Losing fat is my #1 priority, but it's very disheartening when each lifting session goes from being a tough-yet-doable challenge to an absolutely loathsome activity that I can barely do. I figured going down to only lifting 2x/week would help me recover given how little I'm eating right now, but that doesn't seem to have worked too well.

Apologies for the wall of text - I figure it's better to have too much information than too little, haha. I deeply appreciate any and everyone that takes the time out of their day to read all of this nonsense.

A little background: I eased into SKD in August but since I was training for my first half marathon, I only gave up the obvious junk stuff (didn't really restrict fruit/veg but gave up sweets, starches, and most grains).  After the half-marathon at the end of August, I jumped in with both feet and have been doing a basic SKD ever since. The timing of starting stricter keto coincided with a decrease in running due to colder weather and my concerns about keeping up with endurance activity while really starting keto.  Between then and the holidays my mileage went from appx. 20-25 miles/wk to less 5-10.  
From what I've read about running, the ""wall"" that you hit is when the body switches from burning carbs to burning fat.  Not sure if that is true, but if so, wouldn't just staying in keto be preferable because you would just burn fat the whole time and avoid the ""wall"" altogether? Why have carbs if the goal is to burn fat and you already are with a SKD?
Now that holidays are over I've been getting back into running (treadmill) and am not sure if I should be adding carbs back in or not. I'm not running as far/strong as I did last summer, but I'm not sure if it is my diet or just being out of shape. 
Also, I want to start some strength training on a regular basis.  Should I take in carbs or just stick with SKD?  I occasionally do a boot camp like class which I believe is HIIT and seem to manage without changing my diet.

I am a 150lb female, 5'4"", looking to lose about 20-25 pounds. This is my second week on SKD, however, I've done this before (I just fell off the bandwagon for a month or so -sadface-). Currently, I lift weights (almost no cardo unless it's conditioning week). I don't use machines, but barbells. So I'm doing jerks, snatches, squats (back and front), kettle bells, box jumps, pull ups, etc. etc. I have a program that I do and I try to go 4-5 times a week dependent upon my school schedule. I'm also planning on putting in a bit of cardio in on the weekends -- nothing strenuous. It'd be walking on the treadmill for 30 minutes to an hour while reading for school as my body looooves to hold onto fat. 

Anyway... One of my questions is: should I postpone TKD until I get to my goal weight? I'd like to keep maxing out on my PRs (max week is every six weeks after a five week program), but at the same time, I'd really like to lose this weight, but I do find that some days are harder than others. I'm assuming that's because I'm only on my second week of SKD again and it's always harder during shark week (sorry, guys...), but I'm looking for a little advice as I'd like to lose fat and gain muscle. 

If I should start TKD say, next week, or in the next few weeks, what foods would be best? I have read some of the threads, but I'm still confused about it. Like, someone mentioned candy, well, what type of candy? What are easily digestible carbs that I can eat? I'm thinking of only eating about 20carbs before/after, however I'm still working through the math/science of all that as I don't know my body fat percentage and I'm still trying to understand it all. 

My last question, promise, is should I do TKD before or after my workout? People seem to have different opinions about it and I'm leaning towards before myself in order to help with my energy levels, so I can continue maxing out, but I ask because again I'm still a bit confused. 

I am super sorry if this post is annoying and repetitive. I promise I've been reading, I'm just trying to figure this all out in order to reach my goals and unfortunately, some, if not most, of this goes over my head.

after doing SKD for about 6 months (and losing 50 pounds !)

Furthermore, I have heard that the starting period can be rough, and that I shouldn't do any re-feedings during that time. Should I also stop lifting during this period? I would really rather not do this, but I am really sick of seeing this spare tire around my midsection.

Finally, the keto calculator was suggesting that I not eat more than 160 g protein per day. I just want to clarify that this number will indeed be sufficient for someone who lifts regularly.

Here's the question: If I have some carbs, lets say 50-100, immediately post workout with some lean protein, then how many hours should I wait till I can resume my normal high-fat keto diet without risking large amounts of fat storage?

I realize the whole reason for the carbs post-workout is to create an insulin rise that is helpful for muscle growth following a workout, but at the same time, if I eat any dietary fat during this insulin response then I am going to store it, right? So how many hours should I wait after 'carbup' before I can eat keto again? Would 1 &amp; a half hours do it? Or should I be waiting till the next day and just go carb crazy on workout days in leangains style?

In case you think it's not worth it to have any carbs post-workout, tell me why. Also, I think it's probably beneficial for leptin levels -- do you do carbnite or something like that instead of carbs post workout?

Thanks!

Now that I've found you all, I'd like your opinions on a dilemma I'm having.

I'm 27, female, and about 230 lbs.  Clearly, I need to lose weight.  In my past experience, keto works pretty darn well for that.  Plus, bacon.

However, I also love lifting weights.  I'm well past the beginner stage (2+ plate squat, 3+ plate deadlift), and have goals to squat 3 plates and pull 4 plates.  FWIW, I run 5/3/1 on a M/T/Th/F schedule, with some sort of lighter lifting on most of my ""off"" days. 

My questions to my fellow ketogainers are the following: 

* Did/does doing the TKD instead of a SKD significantly stall your weight loss efforts?

* How were your strength gains or strength retention on a TKD as compared to SKD?  Particularly applicable would be post-noob gain experiences.  

* For someone with my goals, would you recommend a SKD or a TKD?

* Have any of you tried drastically upping your protein to try and get more carbs through gluconeogenesis as opposed to eating carbs?  If so, how did that work out for you?

Thanks in advance for your advice. :)

5 x 8 chinups
5 x 3 pullups
3 x 25 dips
3 x 25 pushups

Afterwards:

Run 2km warmup, then 3km fast-paced(monday!)
Run 2 km warmup, then 5 km interval(wednesday)
Run 10 km normal paced(friday).

Prior to these workouts I do drink a smoothie with barries in it. I can't perform with zero carbs at all, I get dizzy as hell.

So, this has worked out alright for me so far. I've lost over 10kgs and gained a significant amount of muscle, especially my arms look SO much better than before. But can this be improved in any way?

Considering that it 50% of the weight must be water that's evaporated during the cooking process - would it be possible for me to somehow gauge how much fat i am losing when cooking the meatballs?

It's hard because I know the fat is going which screws my macros but also it screws with the calories of it. 

Should I maybe try to keep the left over fat and weigh that separate to the meatballs to figure out how many grams of fat is coming out?

We do a 1 day a week carb load of about 300-400gms. He eats about 150g protein and about 170g fat per day.. Any more info needed? Thanks for your help :)

1. To stay in Ketosis you have to eat lots of fat. 1g protein per gramm of fat is a good start. 

2. So furthermore I should eat 1g protein per pound of lean bodymass. 

What I do is more or less leangains ketostyle. I cut on -30/-10.

**My stats:**

- height: *176cm*

- weight: *150lbs* 

- leanbodymass: *140lbs (could be a bit less or more)*

On workout days I end up with:

- 1854.92 kcal

- 22.62 g Carbs

- 135.73 g Protein

- 129.65 g Fat

So no problem at all, I reach my protein amount almost exactly.
Now off days.

- 1341.65 kcal

- 16.36 g Carbs

- 98.17 g Protein

- 93.77 g Fat

As you can see I am far away from the 140g of protein I should be eating and I don't know what to do.

So what is worse? Eating to less protein, but staying in ketosis or eating enough protein, but maybe getting kicked out of ketosis?

And yes the values are accurate, I use a excel table with the right formulas for my BMR and than I calculate my TDEE via pal factor.
At the moment I have to much free time, since my study will start in september. So my TDEE on off days is really low.

I hope someone can help or ease my mind, because I am really afraid to loose all my muscles.

The million dollar question is what I should do during rest days? 

Should I do some cardio (planning on riding my bike around my neighborhood, it's pretty hilly so it should be a decent workout I guess) 

or 

Should I hit the gym again and do some accessory exercises that aren't part of Stronglifts 5x5?

I fell off the keto wagon last week as I was visiting my partner's family and wanted to just avoid having to explain to them my limitations. It wasn't out of shame - simply just avoiding questions from extended members of the family that already think I'm a weird dude. I also had stopped working out for about two months as I had a nasty little battle with prostatitis.

Anyway, when I fell off I fell off big and now I feel like a piece of shit. My partner and I are moving in a month and I want to feel and look good for my fresh start.

At my best, I am lifting weights and looking lean and vascular at around 147 pounds, but right now weigh in at a slightly doughy 152. My goal is to get as lean as possible over the next four weeks while getting back on keto tomorrow. I also have very limited equipment as I am saving money for the move by not paying for my gym membership.
Can I get a recommendation for a routine with the following equipment at my disposal.

* Dumbbells: 10 lb, 15 lb, 20 lb, 40 lb, 50 lb 

* Barbell: adjustable to 110 lbs 

* Pullup bar 

* Pushup bars

I'm not looking to set any unrealistic goals but just something that will give me a sense of momentum and trim me a little bit in a short period of time while paired with keto. If I could get cut two or three pounds and get my muscles back in shape, that would be ideal.

205lbs

Current working weight: 
Squat: 170lbs
Bench: 100lbs
OHP: 70lbs
Deadlift: 205lbs
Clean: 100lbs

I usually lift first thing in the morning. I usually don't have time to eat beforehand, so I have some caffeine, a tablespoon of honey, and a tablespoon of coconut oil. Up until last week, this was enough to get me through my workouts.  

But, last week I started seriously stalling.  I'm fine for the beginning of the workout, I can bust out my squats and then my bench or OHP (depending on the day) no problem. But then when I got to deadlift (or on Monday, cleans) I just got weak. I couldn't lift what I could the week before, like it just wouldn't come off the ground. In addition to that, I was shaky and had other low-blood sugar symptoms (palms of hands turning white, tingly feet)  Last week, when this happened just before I was going to deadlift, I went home and had a banana and then went back to the gym and did not only just fine, but lifted more than I had before.  But I was off work last week and can't do this every time. 

I'm wondering if I need to get up earlier and have something to eat, even considering switching off of keto and having oatmeal beforehand so I can power through and give it everything I have.  

Or, should I double my honey &amp; coconut oil?  I really don't want my diet to be the reason my progress stalls on my lifts. 

TL;DR:  I do TKD, and lift fasted except for honey, caffeine and MCT oil. Strength fails about 1 hour into my lifting &amp; need advice to be able to make it through.  

UPDATE:  Thanks for the advice guys!! Things I'll do today: eat more fat &amp; get some maple syrup.  Because I'm lifting tomorrow!

I'll be experimenting over the next few weeks to see which pre-workout suggestions work best for me: eating fat&amp;whey, eating oatmeal&amp;maple syrup, or just replacing my current honey with maple syrup &amp; keep lifting fasted.

However, no site mentions (none that I've seen anyway) the percentage or amount of extra protein that will kick you out. Is it 10% over, 20g over, 50g? 

I don't know my body fat % as most of it is around my thighs and tummy, so if I use the higher end then I may not be hitting the minimum needed for muscle retention and if I use the lower end of bf% then I might be getting more.

What I really want to know is; does it really matter if I was to consume 10g above the maximum stated needed for when working out? Everyone says to aim for 1g-1.2g of protein per lbm but what happens if you have 1g of protein per lb that you weigh? In my case around 129g, will I really get kicked out of keto? 

Would appreciate any help as some days I've gotten close to 130g of protein due to some errors in calculation and I've been wondering if I'd gotten kicked out of keto during those times. I'd buy the ketostix to check but considering how I didn't have any of the keto symptoms, then I don't think the sticks will be helpful at all especially since afaik they only test for one type of ketones.

Been dieting since August of last year, lost my first 20 lbs doing the Slow Carb diet, but felt horrible from the cheat days and I switched to Keto in December and never looked back. Started at 325 and I am down to 265 currently and I want to start doing some strength training to tighten up loose skin and build some muscle.

They have some Elipticals and Treadmills and then several weight machines. Like Pull down machine, leg lift machines etc. I havn't worked out since I played football in highschool and I am kind of lost on where to go from here. If someone could point me out to a workout plan or some hints on what to do with the limited equipment I have it would be very much appreciated.

I just finished dropping weight using SKD in order to move from the welterweight class to lightweight(I was too short and pudgy, in this class I'm large and tall) a couple of weeks ago. After that I upped my calories by 500 and my carbs by 15g a day(before workouts), but the weight is still coming off. I don't really want to keep losing, I feel like the weight I'm at right now is perfect for me until before competition when I can drop water to make 155. However, I'd still like to melt off that subcutaneous fat that's still hiding my lower 4 abs. 


So my question is: What do I need to change in order to maintain my weight while still losing BF%? A gain or loss of a couple pounds doesn't worry me, I'd really just like to get that six pack.

I'd also be very interested in improving my performance for the sport. I'm decently strong, and usually as fast or faster than most of my sparring partners, and my endurance is among the best in my gym. What I lack is power, explosiveness, and agility. In sparring sessions I can grind out 6-7 five minute rounds and still have plenty of gas in the tank, or three hours of classes in a day. But I just can't seem to rock people and knock heads off like a lot of guys I train with since going keto. 

I've considered switching to Primal or Paleo, and looked into Mike Dolce's program, but I don't want to add carbs back in, bloat up, and have trouble making weight later. I also feel better in my day-to-day on keto than on carbs.

Give unto me your knowledge, my bretheren!

My current stats: 5'8, 163 lbs, approx 15% BF, daily macros vary but are generally: 140-150g Fat, 120-140g Protein, 30-40g Carbs, 1900-2500 calories.

For instance, an experienced lifter who is still 25% bf, won't need to carb up as often as someone who's somewhat newer to lifting, but only 10% bf, no?

Plus, leptin has a lot to do with your bf levels.

So things were going well with the kettlebell challenge. Finished day 8, feeling strong. Well, maybe not strong, but at least capable. When I wasn't dizzy. That should have been my first clue. 

See I have this strange problem of [not eating enough](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/food/diary/noughttoseehere?date=2013-05-10). I try. Honestly I do, I stuff myself and eat good quality food and do what I can to make sure I'm getting enough. I reason in my head that I still have [plenty of fat](http://imgur.com/hj1focb) to lose and I should be fine. 

I wasn't. 

Between both of my kids getting sick (chest infection and ear infection, oh so much fun), picking up extra shifts at work and the general awful sleep that comes with stress, I have crashed. Woke up this morning dizzy and weak. Got about 30 swings in and my body went NOPE - dizzy, almost fell over, and the 15lbs weight I've been tossing around suddenly felt like it weighed more than me. 

**Tl;DR** didn't take care of myself or treat my body well, failed out of the kettlebell challenge (or at least taking a day off). 

ProTip:

* eat enough food. Especially protein. Lacking in important stuff won't make weight loss any faster, it just makes you feel like crap after a while
* get enough quality sleep. Giving your body time to repair allows you to push more
* Listen to your body - I knew I was getting close to burnout - I was getting dizzy and weak, walking home from work last night was a lot more of a chose than it should have been, but I still tried to push through today and almost ended up hurting myself (no really, there was a moment I was sure I was going to faceplant with the momentum from my swing)",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,False,,cust ielift,True,t3_1edsfp,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1edsfp/damnit_or_why_taking_care_of_yourself_is_important/,

* Thurs (off or light cardio)
* Fri (off or light cardio)
* Sat (light cardio or sprints)

Keto days (Mon-Sat; 3-6 hour eating window): ~1430 cals (85.5f, 24c, 142.5p)

**Current stats: Male, 22 yo, 5'9', 162 lbs, ~15% bf.**

*The basic premise*: Once keto is started, after a week at at least 500 cal deficit a day, I replenish near or full muscle glycogen on Sunday (research suggests I can get near full glycogen replenishment in 8 hours or pretty much full by 12 hours). The following day I do 30 minutes of moderate cardio and 15 minutes of HIIT to burn the liver glycogen, returning to ketosis, yet retaining muscle glycogen for my lifts the following 3 days. During my two back-to-back lifting days, I burn most of the glycogen from my muscles. The rest of the week I slowly taper the remaining glycogen, before doing an intense depletion workout with intervals before my refeed. Rinse, repeat.

What I am eating at the moment (this is static and doesn't change; I eat the same thing every day):

**Low carb:** 

*(9f, 8c, 62p) – 360 cal*			8 oz Silk almond milk (unsweetened), 2.5 scoops ON, 1 T cocoa**;**
*(42f, 3c, 65p) – 650  cal*		3 whole eggs, 1 white, 8 oz egg whites,  3 oz cheddar jack**;**

*(0f, 4c, 1p) –	25 cal*			4 oz V8**;**
*(0f, 3c, 2p) – 30 cal*			1 C broccoli**;**
*(.5f, 2c, 4p) - 32.5 cal* 5 oz spinach**;**
*(2f, 0c, 0p) - 18 cal* 2 fish/flax/borage oil caps


=1430 (85.5f, 24c, 142.5p)

**High carb:**

8 low-fat poptarts (1440; 20f, 272c, 16p)**;**
3 brownie clif bars (690; 13.5, 117c, 27p)**;**

Been lurking /r/keto for some time though. I have a good grasp on how nutrition. I want to basically lean out while still gaining strength but not necessarily to much mass. I did a full 12 weeks of strong lifts last year when I was in Afghanistan and I increased strength gains a small amount but never felt that it was that effective. So I didn't continue when i got home and then got fat from all of the beer and food that comes along with coming home from overseas. At the end of last year I found out that my T levels were in the toilet for a 90 year old. I'm 23, so obviously that is a problem and it explained why I have stayed skinny fat all these years despite being fairly fit and lifting heavy on a regular basis. That being said I started doing stonglifts again but I also started keto around the same time. I have recently started hitting a serious plateau around 235 squat and 255 deads. I was lifting more in Afghanistan and I am not losing any weight really so this did not make much sense to me. I have now come up with a plan of action to increase both strength gains and weight loss. I believe that since I have lifted a significant amount in the past that I am not a beginner weight lifter. So i am going to switch to the Texas method as outlined on t-nation.com. And I think the next step for keto would be the TKD style. Here is my plan.

Height: 6ft
Current Weight:170Ibs     Current BF%: 17%
Goal Weight:175Ibs          Goal BF%: 8%-10%

Current Lifts 5RM
Squats: 235-240Ibs
Deads: 255-265Ibs (maybe more. Didnt want to hurt myself with poor form.)
Bench Press: 155Ibs (I know... it's just disgraceful)
Overhead press: 115Ibs (also awful)
Chins: 9 reps at BW

For the TKD I want to stick with caveman_keto's 7 day plan. I think i have to add more calories to the mix in pork rinds or almonds. For the ""carb-up"" part, can I just drink a 32 oz powerade with some BCAAs mixed in before the workout. Then 25g protein shake afterward. Or is there more to it than that? Also how detrimental is beer/alcohol to this whole ""getting shredded"" thing? Will I have to give that up to get semi decent for beach season?

Darthluigi recommended I stop by and ask for advice.

I'm 5'11"" and 190, with about 20% bf. (Works out to 150 lean lbs, 40 fat).

I am totally committed to getting abs by late June for my birthday. I have already gone almost a month without soda or junk food or even bread (god help me) and I've already lost about eight pounds. Would you mind helping me tweak my diet and exercise to make sure I get there?

I use MFP, which recommends I keep my calories under 1,400 to lose 2 pounds a week. 

I eat every three hours and usually have some raw spinach or other greens with every meal but don't take the time to count the calories because they're so low. I drink between a half-gallon and a full gallon of water daily. I sleep at least six hours a night, usually more. A typical day looks something like this:

Breakfast (470 calories): 

* A protein shake made with almond milk
* Two tbsp of organic peanut butter
* Two slices of bacon

Lunch (230):

* Two string cheese sticks
* A few slices of no-salt roasted turkey

Dinner (280):

* Four oz of chicken breast
* One slice of bacon

Snacks (335):

* 1/4 cup of cashews
* Protein shake made with almond milk

On days that I exercise, I add about 300 calories of similar food and a protein shake right before bed (I exercise late).

I absolutely can't afford a gym membership, so I'm stuck with pull-ups and push-ups at home. I don't want to gain 30 lbs of muscle; I just want to maintain what little muscle I have and hopefully gain some tone. I may want to gain muscle in the future, but for now it's all about the abs.

Three or four times a week, I:

* Do three sets of pull-ups (the number of reps is embarrassing; I used to be able to do 15, not anymore.)
* Do four to five sets of push-ups (same).
* Run about a 1.5 mile, alternating between sprinting and jogging.

The running is getting easier, so I'll likely up the distance and sprint more. But the push-ups and pull-ups are difficult without the energy I get from carbs. It seems like I'm wiped out about halfway through the second set. How do you find energy to do this stuff? Would a tablespoon of honey twenty minutes before exercise kill me?

No one but me can get those abs. I want to earn them. But your knowledge sure would make it easier. 

Thanks for your help, ladies and gents!

My first post here and on Reddit ever. I've read the FAQ and come from doing Leangains (and have been doing it for a year with okay results). I'm shifting to keto to try something new + see if it is more ""forgiving""/ easier to do long term. I'm in everything for the long term.

I don't believe this has been answered, but here it is: if calories from fat are more easily stored as fat on a surplus, does one automatically store massive amounts of fat on a surplus doing keto? Because the diet is by nature, high fat.

I ask out of worry. I usually eat 2 massive meals a day (though I have stopped counting macros with keto) and since I came back to my country, jet lag has caused me to eat 3 massive meals instead. All meals are keto (high protein + high fat). 

In the 5 days or so since I've come back, I stayed the same in terms of scale weight but put some VERY visible ab fat on. So I'm wondering if a surplus on keto is an ""instant death"". 

I know for a fact that when not in ketosis: carbs + fat in a surplus = that fat being stored. I'm wondering if it is the same when in ketosis?

Yes, I have read the Faq, Keto in a Nutshell, a huge post on bodybuilding.com and checked out the calculator. I think Keto will be perfect for me


First off, my goal is to get shredded (8-10% BF), continue to build muscle and hopefully lower my prehypertension.  I have been working out for 4 years doing a myriad of workout, but always including weightlifting.  For the last year I have been focusing on increasing my lifts (lifting 5x a week) and playing hockey on the weekends.


**Stats:** 
178-180lbs, 28 year old male, 5’10.5’’ 32-34 inch waist. 16-16.5% bodyfat


**Weight Lifting Stats: I want to maintain these.**
Bench 275x3-4, Pullups: 15 x 3 sets, Deadlift: 275-300lb x 8, Squat 300lb x 8, Legpress: 540lb x 8


**Nutrition:**
I have been following IF/leangains for a while.  I love the schedule for eating, but honestly I think use it too often as a crutch to eat like shit.   I tend to do well during the week, but bad on the weekend.  I would like to do IF + Keto with 1 carb refuel day on the weekend.


**Plan: ** 
I plan to stop eating around 6-7pm on Sunday and will stay fasted until noon on Monday.  I plan to eat 0-5 carbs for the first 2 days, then bump up to around 25 carbs a day after that.  I am planning the following macros:
2250 Kcal; 25 carbs; 150g protein; 170 gram fat.  


I probably will start off with AreYouReadyToReddit's 6 Day Key Meals and then branch out to recipes found on this site and bodybuilding.com’s forum.

Does everything seem solid?  Should I fast a full 24 hours for the first day, a post on bodybuilding.com suggested this.    Should I expect drops in my lifts by only recarbing on Sundays?  Anything I am missing?

So I'm on my third week of keto. Feeling good, lost about 11 lbs, so can't really complain too much. However, my lifts have gone down quite a bit and I'm a little concerned that I am losing strength/muscle.  

I used the ketogains calculator, and am following the calorie/macro goals to lose fat. At 238 lbs and ~25% body fat, getting ~170 g protein on non-workout days, ~200 on workout days.   

I've been working on linear progression (SS, original novice program) and I started almost 3 months ago with some **pathetic** numbers given my size... my squats, for example, were 80 lbs. *eighty. pounds.* In that three month period, I raised it up to 190 lbs, but I was *struggling* to get it up. I got my 3x5, but *barely* and my knees were rolling inward, which is **big** uh oh!  

I had to lower that down, so I took off 20 lbs. I was able to finish that set, but I was still struggling! I did the same with the rest of my lifts.   

Now I know it's expected to have to reset sooner or later, and I have been struggling the past couple of weeks. I also missed two days due to a family emergency, which I'm sure didn't help - but it was a pretty drastic drop (~20% on all lifts). Still much better than where I started, but not a good sight, it's almost like the progress I made over the past two weeks has been totally erased.  

So I'm wondering; did changing my diet possibly cause the drop? Is this  normal or have I lost some strength? I don't *look* like I've lost any muscle, but the it's hard to tell. In any case I've reset back to the lower weights and will continue the progression, but am I going to have to choose between losing fat and gaining strength?",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,False,,,True,t3_1atgm7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1atgm7/keto_strength_loss_concerns/,

As I understand from Art and Science of Low Carb Performance, the beauty of fat adapted athletes is they don't need to try to keep up on carb fueling during an event.  The body can only take in and utilize X grams of carbs / hour.  Before too long, the body can't take in enough and carbs are gone.  

Carbs cause an insulin spike and turns off the bodies ability to burn fat as a primary fuel source.

I am concerned about taking in carbs and ruining the months of fat-adaption I have built up.  I think it's different from a very intense session in the gym as that is full throttle for 1-2 hours.  16 hrs is a long time.

**Is is possible to change your bodyshape via exercise? And should women stop doing full squats and the same exercises for a slim down, as guys use for bulk up?**

I saw a link at this subreddit to a article on t-nation about female training - http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/sexy_female_training

Basically it explains how to train in order to obtain hourglass, which also is my goal. But the article also mentions that it is a mistake that women are told to do the same movements for a slim down, as guys do for building muscles (squat, leg press etc)

&gt;"" (...) I asked this same trainer what lower body parameters he would use on a female who was trying to slim down her hips and thighs. His answer? Squats, lunges, and leg curls.

&gt; From a training perspective, if a guy is trying to build up his quads, the worst thing he can do is spend 45 minutes running on a treadmill every other day. Why? Because long-distance running will shrink your thigh muscles quicker than anything else. So if you're a female who thinks your hips and thighs are too big, you'd benefit from long distance running.

&gt; if you're a woman and you don't want bigger thighs, don't do what men do to build up their thighs. And if you want slimmer thighs, then do the things that men avoid when they're trying to build up their thighs — long distance running, for one.""*


And the program that is suggested is a lot of bodyweight stuff, mixed with cardio (not HIIT) - and some sets with 50 reps! Where is my low reps with heavy weights??

I also read in another article, promoting the Venus Index, that women should not be doing the full back squat?! ***sigh***

(The Venus Index is a mathematical formula for determining and working toward your ideal height-to-waist, waist-to-hip, and shoulder to waist ratios. The workouts are supposed support the formula by building nice shoulders, shrinking your waist, lifting your butt, and improving definition.)

**So now I am confused - I have been doing a ton of heavy squats, sumo deadlifts, step ups, lunges. Will this increase the size of my legs even more and move me further away from hourglass shape?** 

**Can anyone recommend any way of training for me? Should I just give up my heavy squats and do the program in the article?**

***My training now:*** I have been doing crossfit for 6 months, but now I am back at a normal gym 5 days a week. I do 2 heavy lifts each session, reps 6x4, and then metabolic resistance training the rest of the time, where I do circuits with little rest and moderate weights. I just switched from a style of training, where I did more heavy stuff, 5-6 exercises pr. session with low reps. I incorporated MRT for greater fat loss, but I dont know if it is efficient. (Used this as an inspiration: http://www.negharfonooni.com/2013/03/14/the-lean-and-lovely-recipe/)


It is not that I have been too lazy to do some research myself. I have convinced myself that women should train hard, heavy and mostly like guys, but these articles mentioned confuses me. I have read SO much about different training programs, SS, 5-3-1, 5x5, Sheiko, GVT etc - but I feel like that is something I will start when I have lost more weight and is back in my own country and have a training partner.

My goals are to continue to lose body fat, but also start gaining some muscle.  My end game isn't necessarily to be ripped, but I would like to have some definition.  I'd prefer strength over appearance.  With that being said, I feel like TKD is the right way to go, but have a few questions.

My only real experience with working out was almost a decade ago when I was doing Body for Life.  That plan encouraged a pyramid style weight lifting plan every other day, alternating between upper body and lower body.  It would basically be 6 sets of 12, 10, 8, 6, 12, 12 reps, increasing weight until I got to the last 2 sets, which I would drop the weight back down to what I did on the 8 rep set (I believe)  Would that sort of exercise plan be ok, or is there a better way?  This is where I feel i'm needing the most advice.  I really have no idea what exercises are the most effective, and I want to make sure the appropriate muscle groups are being targetted.  I have a weight bench at home ([exactly like this, except not in the woods](http://images1.americanlisted.com/nlarge/golds_gym_weight_bench_extras_150_greenwood_13862437.jpg)) with dumbells going up to 30lbs.  I've also got plate weights that I can use to construct dumbells if I need more than 30lbs.

On the days that I wouldn't lift on BFL, I would do ~30 minutes of HIIT cardio.  Is this necessary on TKD?

Lastly, I read that anywhere from 25-50 grams of carbs should be consumed before and after lifting.  I assume that this does not apply to cardio.  I've also read that the carbs you consume should not be fructose.  So what would you recommend I use for those 25-50 carbs before and after the workouts?  I think I read that the carbs before the workout should be consumed 30-60 minutes before.  What about after?  Right away?

Finally, is there anything I should be doing in addition to these things?

I am currently eating something like 30g of net carbs daily plus 20-40g of net carbs before I exercise (TKD). 

EDIT: 20-40 total carbs (usually 15-30 net carbs)

My maintenance level is round 1800 kcal.

In your experience, are carbs 2-3 hours AFTER exercise good for you? (Rather than before) If so, how much? Is it going to put me out of ketosis for long?

I lost a bunch of weight last year which I will attribute primarily to the diet, and I've found myself some more free time to really focus on the gym again and get going.

My problem is really about the breakdown of cardio and strength. I used to find that splitting my time between the two did manage to help weight loss, but a problem I also found is the muscle gain. I already have built up a decent frame due to the last few years but have always had a problem losing the last few pounds around my belly. By splitting my time (which a lot of keto people have advised me to do) I actually see more muscle gain then fat loss. All throughout my strength training was low intensity, high repetition, throughout all muscle groups. Cardio was a blend of running, cross training, and rowing machines, typically high intensity interval training for 1 to 1/2 hours split between the three.  My goal isn't really to build up any more mass but focus purely on removing those last few pounds!

So I ask you this: is there any specific exercises you do on keto which allows you to focus purely on weight loss, strength or cardio? I don't have any interest of being a muscular body, just interested in shedding the last of the fat!

Any advice would be appreciated!

I am now reaching a point where I want to lose fat and build muscle at the same time. I am going to start boxing training next week (no fighting as I am a big sissie and SWMBO forbade it) and was wondering if my plan would pass your scrutiny:

Exercise:

*  20mins cardio x2 (cycling) on weekdays

*  boxing training: 2h on Tues / Thu / Sat. 7pm-9pm

Food:

* Keto-on: cal. intake 1.8kcal

* 30 mins before boxing training: 100g of bread to carb-up.

* Going cold turkey on alcohol, looks like Islay caused my plateau.

What do you think? Am I being unrealistic here? 
I need a _lot_ of energy for my day job and that's why Keto works well for me, I am a bit affraid of carbing-up before training and being completely out of whack in the morning.

I'm about 5'8"" and hovering around 165 lbs. I've been on SKD keto (with a few breaks) for about a year and I've lost about 55 lbs. Using a bunch of online calculators and a bio impedance meter, I've estimated that I'm approximately 20% body fat. 

My diet is really simple. It's usually some mix of avocado, chicken, and cheese for meals with spinach or romane lettuce. I try to play it by ear as to what I eat, but I guess that I'm hitting about 1600 cals a day.
My workout regime has been primarily 5 sets of HIIT where a set is 5 minutes of 30 sec sprint 30 sec rest with 3 minutes of rest between sets. I do this between 2-5 times a week depending on my work schedule and whether or not I feel like I need a rest day; I'd say most weeks I get to the gym 4 times.

My goal is to get down to about 10% body fat (I wanna see my abs), while looking, working, and feeling like a badass. I was planning on cutting down as much as possible before starting a TKD or SKD diet to gain muscle. My defined goals at the end of the body transformation would be that I want to be able to bench at least 240, squat 350, and bicep curl 50 lbs (with the appropriate balance in antagonist muscle groups.)

Question 1: 
Should I continue to do running type (cardio) exercises or should I change it up and do some weightlifting?

- My concern in this regard is that weight lifting apparently burns less calories and I'd like to continue to lose weight before trying to bulk up. Also, conventional wisdom is that you cant gain muscle mass with a caloric deficit.

Question 2: 
Should I switch to a TKD/CKD approach now, gain some muscle mass, and then cut afterwards? 

- I think that I would fall under the category of skinny fat now. My bench is probably about 120 lbs, and my squats are probably 180 lbs (this might be higher I just dont remember). Should I start trying to build muscle now? or wait until I hit my BF% target.


Question 3: Do I need to be doing TKD/CKD for muscle gain or will SKD suffice? 

- There is just a lot of competing information stating that SKD is sufficient, but TKD/CKD improves performance. I'd like to avoid CKD because carbs now hit me like an anvil. If I can make significant substantial gains without carbs then I'd prefer it. I'd be nice to know the experiences of community members as they pertain to muscle gain on SKD.

1. Since I'm a beginner and won't be training at as high an intensity as seasoned lifters, will I be able to get away with remaining on SKD and supplementing with MCT oil prior to workouts for energy? Would the 12 or so carbs in a mix like Twin labs MCT Fuel benefit me without affecting ketosis?

I dropped 45 lbs and hit my goal weight (180 down from 225).

From April - November, I did not diet, though I kept my fridge stocked in a very paleo style (keto + sweet potatoes and some fruit), but I didn't pay attention to what I ate when I went out with friends.

I did not gain a pound back.

I decided I want to try to build muscle/lose more body fat and maybe go for abs if I can. So I started a workout routine and keto about two weeks ago. I'm doing Power90. I'm actually approaching 170 now. I'm almost 6'1, so I'm pretty lean in appearance now.

I'm thinking of switching from keto+workout to a TKD. 

I read through the FAQ, and a few threads.  I seem to be finding contradictory advice as to eating before or after the workouts.  Should I be consuming carbs before and after the workout, or just before?  The FAQ seemed to indicate not to eat fat right after the workout while insulin levels are high.

I have a protein powder that contains some carbs.  I was thinking of eating some carbs (I have brown rice cakes and corn tortillas) before the workout, then almond milk with the protein powder mixed in after.  Would this meet the criteria for a TKD?

MCTs and SCFAs [RANT],Forevernade,9,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/139sb0/carbs_are_never_necessary_mcts_and_scfas_rant/,"I will admit I am new here, but a quick browse over the first few pages and I am surprised at seeing so much carb-talk... Carbing up before workouts? Superstarch? I thought you guys would be more educated...

If you carb up before every second workout, of course you are going to keep feeling flat, you are knocking yourself out of ketosis and allowing your body to rely on carbs for fuel. People who talk about 'feeling flat' are obviously have not yet adapted to working out while keto, and shouldn't be listened to if they are advocating carbs for workouts.

SuperStarch? Same thing, you are relying on carbs, again, for your energy and selling yourself short.

Then what do I do if I want instant energy? Well, there are these things called MCTs and SCFAs, these acronyms stand for Medium Chain Triglycerides and Short Chain Fatty Acids, they are the fast burning fats. Think of how there are high GI and low GI carbs depending on their complexity and chain-length... this same quick and slow burning thing happens for fats too! Animal fats are a combination of saturated and monounsat C16 and C18 fats, the number represents the length of the fat chain. They are Long Chain Triglycerides and are metabolized by the gut.

MCTS and SCFAs bypass most of the gut and are metabolized quickly like a fast carb. They will in fact BOOST KETOSIS because the liver converts the MCTs into ketone bodies, and the SCFAs are taken up by tissue readily in their current form. LCTs are C13 above, MCTs are C6 to C12, and SCFAs are C5 and below.

Their benefits range from a quick boost of energy (both mental and physical) to increasing insulin sensitivity and improving cholesterol, so don't think they are going to be bad for you in large amounts like consuming sugars which decrease insulin sensitivity and wreck cholesterol.

Now, there are some studies that compare carbs to MCTs, and the carbs win on performance, but they do not take into account that they are using dextrose (a high GI sugar) vs C10 (a medium chain fat)... of course a faster burning fuel is going to win! They also never have a keto group of athletes or a keto group of controls, they are comparing MCTs on performance for carbed up athletes. I can guarantee you now that if you make yourself an MCT emulsion to drink before and while you work out you will perform damn well.

SCFAs are in two things, fermented soluble fibre, and raw dairy products. You can also supplement with a salt butyrate (mag buty or sodium buty) but the buty products are usually pretty expensive and you can't consume enough of them to get a sports-specific benefit (althought they will benefit your general health if consumed regularly).

Just though you guys needed a bit of a knowledge boost, so whenever noobs come on here asking about carbing up, or using X or Y product to get a good workout, just tell them to buy some MCT oil and either emulsify it into some whey (with a tad egg yolk) or add it to their pre-workout meal if they have one.",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,1353027280.0,,,True,t3_139sb0,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/139sb0/carbs_are_never_necessary_mcts_and_scfas_rant/,

Hello fellow Ketonians! I’ve been waiting for this post for a long time because I am continuously doing research and constantly reading to keep learning and making sure I’m getting accurate information and doing things right!

 

Anyways – I’m about 5”10 and my weight fluctuates between 208-213 (~5 lb variation daily depending on water intake) and I would estimate my BF% anywhere between 18%-20% this is estimated by using the guide [here](http://www.leighpeele.com/body-fat-pictures-and-percentages). My weight is never something that concerned me because obviously muscle weighs more than fat, and my goal is always to be putting on more muscle, I go by how I look rather than how much I weigh.

 

In any case, MyFitnessPal has dictated that in order to “lose” 1 lb a week I need to eat 1920 calories a day. Using the Keto calculator thought I toss in 22% as my BF% just to compensate for me looking in the mirror and giving myself more then I should, which tells me I need to be at 1968 to be running a 20% calorie deficit (not sure if 20% is too much or not?). You can find a journal of everything that I’ve started logging with MFP since last Sunday. So I’ve been doing Keto for roughly a week, even though I fucked up last Monday and almost doubled the daily intake of carbs, I’m being a lot more strict about it now. It also has notes on the supplements I take and my workouts, it can be viewed [here](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/reports/printable_diary/workhardb).

 

On the diary above you’ll notice “calories burnt: *x*” which is from a watch that I find is the best overall fitness tracker called [MyBasis](http://www.mybasis.com/tour/) which calculates calories burnt throughout the day by tracking blood pressure and heart rate through shining two LED lights onto the wrist to track blood flow, as well as skin temperature and moisture. I’ll sync it to my phone the next day and add the “exercise notes” as appropriate, it’s a good rough measure of calories burnt and on the website itself you can pull up graphical data that will show raw calories burnt.

 

I’m doing Aworkoutroutines intermediate muscle building routine as my workout, except typically I’ll rotate my days off as needed instead of taking Sat/Sun off like recommended depending on muscle soreness and fatigue. The workout is located [here](http://www.aworkoutroutine.com/the-muscle-building-workout-routine/) and at the end of them I will add maybe 1 or two exercises targeting specific muscle groups instead of compounds. This routine is one I’ve been following for about 2 months and have been more or less consistently going up in weight in every category.

 

Here’s a two month difference picture of me since starting my workout routine and cutting some weight down.

[Pic 1](http://imgur.com/tw4z3hl)

[Pic 2](http://imgur.com/RYUhvjS)  

 

I guess what I’m trying to do is ultimately do a recomp but my two biggest questions are: should I continue with cutting, or should I focus on bulking? And after a week of getting adjusted and figuring this all out, am I doing it right?

I did some cardio from the very beginning to help lose that water weight quicker. I officially started lifting last week and my friend trainer had initially told me that I will not lose any weight and might actually gain some at the beginning while my body adjusts to the lifting.

I don't know what to do any more in terms of effort to find the right gym for me.

I am 169kg now and want to start lifting again with ~150kg, should be there in about 2-3 month hopefully. So I started to look for gyms to start a simple barbell routine, nothing fancy, just to gain some basic strength, pretty much follow good old Mark Rippetoe to the dot and go from there. Simply find an instructor, find a gym, get going with full steam like I did (lost 28kg 3.5 month on SKD, doing already bodyweight exercise and some lifts with an empty barbell).

My flat floor is out of laminat, I call it walking paper, because I managed to break it even by dropping a glass on it one time, imagine a barbell weight disk smashing it. No way I can do training at home with weighted barbells!

So you guys really appreciate with what level of retardedness I have to deal with over here, her is the whole gym search story. I live in Hannover, one of germanys tenth biggest cities. I just emailed this week 15 gyms or sportclubs, about the possibility of doing barbell-training and getting at least partnered with an experienced lifter or personal trainer. These are the results:

* 5 gyms said they had barbells but never heard about a squat rack
* 3 gyms adviced me to skip lifting and do cardio and do their shitty courses
* 5 gyms did not allow squatting due to the risks of injury and insurance issues
* 2 gyms gave positive feedback and an adequate proposition, but they wanted about ~300 euros alone for a personal trainer that helps me until I have good form and do it on my own and also charge at least 100 euros a month even on a student contract. 

None of them ever heard about Mark Rippetoe, Starting Strength or his Barbell-Training, all want me to consider doing their silly machines instead of doing free weight barbelling.

I am sitting here scratching my head, I got two month to find something, moving is pretty much out of the picture until I finish my studies and I am limited to bike and tram, meaning no car, which did not pose a problem here at all. 

So I need a gym here in hannover and I am speculating that maybe someone here is actually from around here and knows where to go.

Kenpokan and Aspria seem the only candidates to appreciate my approach on things, but are extremely expensive if I want any form of instruction and guidance throughout the first month. Before I financially cripple myself for my health, any help or advise would be so appreciated, I jump through my providers cable to give you a hug!

I'm 173lbs, 78.9kg, and my BF% has over the last 4 weeks varied between 18-20% (Last measurement was 19%, last sunday).
I'm currently on 5/3/1 (Periodization), so I go heavy at the gym 4 times a week (for approximately 75 minutes), as well as HIIT for 20 minutes twice a week (Saturday being my complete rest day as I got Squatday on Sunday).
I've never gotten a gym injury yet, so I believe the cardio days provide me with enough rest for my body to repair itself post lift days, and I've kinda reasoned that the cardio increases circulation to my worked muscles - enabling them to recover much more efficiently. 

But other than that, I would describe myself as sedentary.

I've gone with the 1.1g protein per lean body mass lbs ratio, and am sticking to under 25g of carb.
But I really want to jumpstart this diet hard time, by going with 1.6k (the suggested calorie deficit I got from http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/), which is 500ish less calories than the recommended amount of calories from the Ketogains calculator at a 25% deficit. I did previously do a 1.7k (restday)/2.3k diet non-keto/non-low carb style before over a 4 week period, but there was no change in BF% or weight that time.

What I'm wondering is if this would actually work, or if it would put me in starvation mode. So it's the physiological effects I'm interested in, as I believe I have the will power to stick to the 1.6k calorie intake. Would it even be possible to gain muscle mass on the lower calorie intake?
Should I because of the large calorie deficit go for even more protein?
Like say, 1.2-1.5g per lean body mass lbs.

My starting weight was officially 192, but pre-keto, I always weighed in at 187-191 regardless of what I ate. I consider that my normal range, and therefore, I consider myself to have only lost 1 pound on SKD. 

Mid-June, I signed up at the Y to try to actually lose some of this weight. I have been doing C25K program (running between 30 mins-1 hour several times a week), and the fitness coaches at the Y set me up on some of the strength machines. 

From what I read in the FAQs, I get the impression that TKD or CKD are beneficial to better performance. Is that the main reason to switch to one of those? I'm physically active to try to lose weight, adding physical activity hasn't done that so far, so I'm left thinking that exploring a TKD or CKD probably wouldn't be very beneficial either.

I'm currently 6'0 and ~275 pounds. I want to start keto, and if possible step up the very limited lifting I've been doing, as well as some basic cardio.

My questions:

* Is 1 gram of protein per lb a good ratio to go with? I'm unsure if I actually want to be getting 275g a day, and was considering going for ~200.

* How drained does keto leave you feeling? Asking so I know what to expect.

* How much fat would I want to consume daily? I'm sort of lost on how to make gains while losing weight. If it helps, my biggest priority would be losing weight, and hopefully not ending up with twice as much skin as I need. I figure I definitely know how to bulk, if I need to do that later.

I feel like there are some more obvious questions that I can't remember, so I may edit later/ask in comments.

I researched LeanGains alot over the weekend and it sounded cool but the massively high carb requirements in that post workout window scared me off

Therefore I wondered if I could lower the carb requirements to a single portion of sweet potato post workout and make a Keto TKD.

My TDEE is 2700, on training days (4x a week) I'll eat -10% TDEE and on none training days I'll eat -30% TDEE.

290g steak = 858 cals, 0 carbs, 69g fat, 75g protein
200g sweet potato = 190cals, 40g carbs, 1g fat, 3g protein
50g shake = 186 cals, 44g protein, 2gat
85 flapjack bar = 291 cals, 40.2g carbs, 7.2g fat, 21g protein (could swap for an avocado to reduce carbs and get more fat - the flapjack was a free sample that I want to try!)

Total:  2447 cals, 89.2g carbs, 93g fat, 290g protein

I got a little problem. I am cutting on the SKD for about 7 weeks now.
I had some great progress, but now I have a problem. 
Up till now I was never tired  and always felt great.
What I do is i combine SKD with IF. On off days I eat about 1550kcal and on training days about 1650kcal. My maintenance calories are 1960kcal on off days and 2150kcal on training days. I train 3 days a week.

I never had a day or a meal where I ate more than what is on my plan and it worked, but the last few days I have been tierd all the time and felt like I could sleep the whole day. 

I am sure that it is not a lack of salt that is causing this, because I always use a lot of salt on my meals and when I'm still tired I drink about 3-5g of salt with a glass of water. Normaly this was more than enough, but in the last days this did not help at all. 

The only thing I can think of is that I am on low calories for to long and maybe I need 2-3 days where I eat my maintenance calories or so.
The only problem I have with this is that I have a huge 'fear' of gaining weight, since I was fat as a kid. Well this was 5 years ago. Now I am at about 11 - 12% bf.

So, first, a little background on me;

I am a 5'4"" male, 44 years old, have been doing SKD since mid September of 2012. I have managed to shed about 82lbs so far and currently sit at 208lbs (my wife has had similar results and is at 140lbs). We participated in two 5K's during the month of June and are already planning our next. I say ""participated"" because in the first one I ran as hard as I could, walked a bit, ran until I couldn't, walked a bit, etc. I ended up completing the 5K at a pace of 13.5 minutes per mile, which was a personal best for me. The second 5K I power walked with my wife, sprinted ahead on occasion to take pictures, and completed the 5K in 60 minutes. My day to day activity levels are, at best, sedentary. I do go out into the field on occasion (plant construction, manufacturing) but I am a programmer. I sit at a desk.

I would like to continue to lose weight and get myself more physically fit. I do not have any desire to bulk up, get jacked, or compete in any bodybuilding competitions but I *would* like to tone up my muscles, increase my strength, and possibly (once my strength has increased) work on building muscle mass.

So the wife and I joined a gym. Last night we had our appointment with the ~~personal trainer salesman~~ Fitness Consultant. I explained to him that my wife and I have both been on the ketogenic diet since September. He had no idea what I was talking about. I gave him a brief overview of what keto is all about and his first recommendation was that we change the way that we eat. We should be eating 6 meals a day, eating less fat, etc.

I asked him if he had a background in nutrition or if he was a dietician. He said that he wasn't, but ""don't you think all of that excess fat is just going to make you fatter?""... I was dumbstruck. I asked him how much he weighed. 220. I told him that between my wife, myself, and our oldest son... eating a high fat diet has caused us to lose an entire one of him since September. Proof positive that he was wrong was sitting *right in front of him*. He gave up the argument. So we started talking about what I had in mind as far as my workouts.

I've been reading for a few days, talked with some friends who do CKD and lift, and had determined that what was probably best for my wife and I was TKD and strength training. Squats, Bench Press, Deadlift. Squats, Overhead Press, Deadlift. Lather, rinse, repeat. 3 days a week, every other day, with 2 rest days in between.

Evidently I was wrong. I have to work out on the machines. I have to do aerobics and cardio. And I had to do those for a while before I moved on to free weights. And I had to really think about how I'm eating and what I'm eating if I wanted to continue to lose weight. Then he sent us into a room with a trainer who had us doing jumping jacks, lunges, push-ups, and some yoga.

So I already mentioned that I'm a noob. I'm uncertain about what I'm doing. I *think* I have a pretty firm understanding of where I should be headed... but I'm hesitant to say, definitively, that I'm right about this. So I'm coming to you for some advice. What would *you* recommend?

And, since I mentioned TKD, I have to ask... it was everything that I could do to eat those sweet tarts yesterday (my wife could only stomach one of them), shortly before working out.

I posted [this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1g6asm/tkd_dextrose_around_hiit_lifting_and_if_schedule/) around early June and now I am back to share my results and some hypothesis regarding my noob gains!

I made some adjustments to the above workout plan - for the last four weeks I have lifted 6 times a week, roughly an hour each, and have swam or run for 30 minutes a day, typically offset from the lifting session by 12 hours. I set my MFP app to track 1920 kcalories per day, at a 140g protein 140g fat base, and added kcalories from my exercises to maintain a net deficit of approximately 500kcal a day. Over four weeks that adds up to 14,000 kcal, and I have actually eaten under on a few days.

My workouts followed the HIIT-100 plan very closely, and I started week 1 with 40s rests between sets, lowering 10s a week until this week where I am struggling with overall 10s rests. This is a brutal hour to hour and a half long workout, I felt like spaghetti every night. I TKD'd a few workouts but didnt notice a difference so for the most part it was strict SKD, the same as I had been doing since January.


While doing this exercise, I created my own version of IF to take advantage of catabolic states after my workouts. I split my meals evenly into a large breakfast and a large dinner, and consumed each within 30 minutes of my morning or evening workout. Think of it as an 11/1 IF, with the workouts being at the trailing end of each 11 hour fast. I want to point out that the hunger pains on this diet were intense! However, I think there was clearly a big benefit to forcing catabolic states post-workout.

So now the interesting bit! Over the last four weeks, at a calorie deficit, I have managed to gain four to five pounds of body-weight. This was measured daily, in averages, and was highly consistent day to day. I am 95% confident that it is not water weight gain (except that required by lean mass synthesis). In addition, my bf% came in today at just over 12%. Pretty fantastic for a month! The interesting part is the mechanics to get from 185/15% to 190/12%. This is a lean mass increase from 185*.85 = 157.25 lb to 190*.88 = 167.2 lb. This means I gained nearly 10 lbs of muscle, or 2.5 lbs per week. The maximum lean mass synthesis rate for drug-free new lifters (or recovering lifters) is about .015 lb per lb lean mass per week, which ends up being pretty close to 9.6 lb in 4 weeks. 

Similarly, we can calculate the lbs lost of fat. 185 * .15 = 27.75 lb, 190 * .12 = 22.8 lb, for a total loss of 4.9 lb. This is about 1.25 lb/week.

So the fun math:

 3500 kcal deficit / week = -14,000 kcal

 4.9 lb * 3500 kcal / week = -17150 kcal

TOTAL = -31150 kcal


 9.8 lb * 1600 kcal = 15680 kcal


NET = -15470 kcal


So that's the interesting thing! Either my 'deficit' wasn't actually a deficit, and my metabolism was extra slow all month, or something just isn't adding up. Anyhow thought you would all appreciate some awesome results from a former athlete, recovering his high school physique. I plan to post some before/after pictures on July 3rd when I officially hit my 6 month mark!

Feel free to fire away questions, doubts, concerns, etc! I realize these numbers are pretty out of the ordinary, but I'm confident in my results, although I can't say everyone would have similar success.

I've been on keto since 3/3/13. I'm about to switch to CKD (June 17th). Up until now I've been doing somewhat basic lifting routine with high reps, low weight, crunches &amp; pushups. I'm starting to do 5X5 plan. I like it thus far. It seems like an efficient way to work muscles out quickly.

Long time lurker, first time poster here.  I've been in a really depressing stall and have made dismal progress, so I was hoping you guys can help.  I've been on SKD for about 3 months now and I've only lost 10lbs in the first 2 weeks post induction.  I had a carb up 7 weeks in trying to break the plateau and another one 4 weeks after that.  Otherwise, I've been on a strict keto diet.  My info is below.  Can you guys offer some advice?

**BIO**

I'm a 25yo male, in pretty decent health.  5'8"" and approximately 178lbs in the morning.  I work in an office and go to school at night, so most of the time I'm quite sedentary.  But I do try to go to the gym at least 6 times a week (at minimum 3 times a week).
[Pic here, possibly NSFW](http://imgur.com/3XCm3qY) Sorry about the dirty mirror. Can I get a bf% estimate too?

**FOOD**

For breakfast, I usually eat two slices of bacon, two eggs, half an avocado, a sausage and some mushrooms.  Or a glass of bulletproof coffee and a serving of a fatbomb.

Lunch and dinner consists of combination a protein (roasted pork loins, baked chicken thighs, tilapia, steak, burger patties) and sides (creamy cheesy spinach, sauted asperagus in butter, mashed cauliflower, roasted brussel sprouts and bacon).  The few times I have to get a quick lunch I always either a salad bowl at Chipotle (sour cream, avocado, no rice, no beans) or a Santa Fe Chicken Salad at Togos (without tortilla strips).  I'll sometimes snack on almonds and cheeses throughout the day.

I've been shooting for the 65/30/5 ratio and I've been pretty good about it.  There may be some fluctuations of about 5%, but carbs has never been more than 10%.  I eat approximately 1500 calories gross a day, not subtracting whatever is burned by exercise.

**EXERCISE**

For the past 10 weeks, I've been on the 5x5 Starting Strength.  My numbers are:

* Squat - 245lbs
* Bench - 185lbs
* Military Press - 105lbs
* DL - 335lbs
* Cleans - 135lbs

In between lifting days, I do cardio and rest on the 7th day.

I'm planning to change up my work out.  Staring today, I'll be doing muscle groups i.e. chest &amp; tris, back &amp; bis, and legs &amp; core every other day. In between days, I'll be doing complexes for cardio.  I plan to start with the Cosgrove Evil 8 and alternate with the Waterbury every other week.

**MY CONCERNS**

Does it matter that on some days, I only have time to eat two meals?  I do hit my macros and get pretty close to my 1500 cal intake (based on MFP) though.

Does it matter that I'm taking X-tend, which is a carb and sugar free BCAA/EAA intra workout supplement?  According to ketostix, it's not dropping me out of ketosis, but who knows?

My husband (who is already a muscular 6'2"" 190 lbs) met with a personal trainer yesterday and the trainer introduced him to the circuit room. It's a 30 min. circuit with 11 machines: leg press, leg extension, leg curl, chest press, pulldown, rear delt, overhead press, arm curl, arm extension, (only one) ab machine, lower back extension.

He is also not following the keto diet, so his main focus is to lose the 10-15 lbs extra. I feel like my fat loss is coming from the kitchen and I want to get more muscle and definition in the gym. 

In my workouts, I use my max weight that I can lift for 3 sets of 15, or 15-12-12. I exhaust my muscles by the third set. My schedule looks like this: 

Day one- Leg press, leg extension, seated leg curl, back extension, row, pulldown, overhead press, chest press, fly/rear delt, calf extension, arm curl, arm extension, hip adduction, hip abduction, glutes (I really want to continue using these 3 machines, not in the 30 min. room). 

Day two- Elliptical 30 mins, abs (crunches, 2 different ab machines), spine rotation (obliques, I really want to continue using this machine too).

Should I take a break from workouts? Do just a light workout? It's mostly climbing and a little bit of pull-ups, push-ups, military press, core work. If I don't wok out, should I cut my calories to compensate, or do I ""need energy"" to ""heal"" and shit? 

I was thinking I'd just ignore it, try to sleep extra and drink extra water but just pretend it's not there. Then if it got worse I could just give myself a few rest days, but not eat very much, since I'm not hungry anyways. 

Searched all around KetoGains, we've never really discussed what to do with a cold, yet.

I've been stressing out lately, there seems to be a lot of ""This is better"" and ""That is better"" about Keto with carb up days (refeeds) and just permanent keto.

So basically CKD vs Regular Keto.

Sadly, I can't make this post longer and more clear, I'm just hoping that someone with the knowledge here can explain to me if it's better to remain on keto with no refeed days at all or take 1 carb up day a week / 2 weeks.

Reason why I'm asking is that I've been on a plateau for a while now, dropped my calories a bit and started IF to see if it'll work out.

For the past few months (2-3) I'm struggling to gain proper results. I'm moderately active person, I don't remember a week in 2 years when I haven't worked out at least once/week. Except when I travel but even then I do body weight exercises.

Currently, I usually do 3-4 workouts a week, 3 strength trainings - basically strong lifts but more like 3x5 1x4 1x2 (I add more weight with each) and one intense HIIT workout a week.

I want to lose body fat (to like 12%) but still keep gaining muscle.

I'm interested to try keto to improve my results and for the past few days I started to experiment with that diet. 

Overall, here is my current situation:

Weight: 84 kg /185 lbs
Lean Weight: 156 lbs
Height: 186cm / 6'1
Years: 24 years old
Pictures (with different lights): http://i.imgur.com/QpMY0cM.jpg and http://i.imgur.com/Atf6Cnv.jpg

I usually eat around 1900 calories a day (except 1-2 days in weekend when I'm out. I add around 500 calories from alcohol that 2 or 1 days, total. That's max, usually 200-300 calories). 

So sometimes it's 1800, sometimes 2000 plus that night out.

EDIT: Alcohol out. 1900 calories on off days, 2200 on workout days.

It's around 185 grams of protein, 115 of fat and 40 of carbs (net carbs around 25). Since I REALLY don't want to lose muscle I'm still focusing to get enough protein/day than fat. I haven't decreased carbs because I just started but I know I should.

All I eat is turkey breast meat, eggs, bacon, brocoli, lettuce, almonds &amp; cashew nuts, optimum hydro whey protein, olive oil ( although i just added coconut and hemp oil into my diet). Carbs are a higher because I add some blueberries, strawberries or banana (depending on a day).

Based on everything included, what keto plan I should try?

Thanks!

*Friday*: Rest  
*Saturday*: Long-distance training rides (usually 40-50 miles or more, increasing in distance each week)  
*Sunday*: 10-15 mile cool-down ride  

**GOALS**: Previously, my goals were to get stronger and add some lean mass through eating at a surplus and lifting heavily regularly throughout the week. However, I have recently shifted my focus towards training for a 100-mile bike ride around Lake Tahoe in June as a part of the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team In Training. Instead of following the usual pattern of ""eat all carbs all the time"" that is being preached by most of the cyclists I ride with, I wanted to get myself keto-adapted so I could hopefully have some more sustained energy and lose a couple % of body fat while I'm in the process. 

After having tried SKD for about a month as an experiment last winter and loving it, I decided to give it another go after I noticed how lax I was getting with my diet and how much that caused my sugar cravings to come back. It took me a bit longer to enter ketosis this time around, but I've largely been able to maintain it steadily.

At the recommendation of other users, I am trying to take a TKD approach for my longer rides, the most recent of which was this last Saturday. Around 6:00am, I ate a bowl of Kashi GoLean with 2% milk and a couple tablespoons of PB2. It was more than an hour's drive to our starting point. Once I got there, I had two deviled eggs before we finally hit the road.

During our first pit stop about 20 miles in, I had two more deviled eggs and some nut-clusters. I had consistently been drinking water with electrolyte tablets since the early AM.

There was a decent climb between the first and second pit stops that got me pretty tired, but I was able to make it without stopping. At the second pit stop, I had another egg or two, but also a quarter of a PB&amp;J sandwich and about two ounces of trail mix (the kind with M&amp;Ms). From there, we had a good downhill descent, and the remaining 6 miles or so of the ride was relatively flat; however, I found that I just couldn't keep up with the rest of my team for that last stretch. My muscles weren't necessarily cramped or fatigued, I just found that I had a lot less energy to keep my legs moving than I did earlier in the day. I wrapped up those last 6 miles at a leisurely 10-15mph pace, while the rest of my team were easily pushing closer to 20.

I suspect that maybe I was consuming the wrong types of carbs at potentially the wrong times? Maybe I'm not fully keto-adapted quite yet? Should I have avoided that sandwich at the second pit stop?

I've read the FAQ and what it says about TKD, but all of the information seems to be directed towards pre-workout nutrition, with little about what to eat *during* long-haul events. The Tahoe ride will be 9-10 hours long, so I definitely need to make sure I'm eating the right things before **and** during the race.

Any advice or feedback is certainly welcome!

I've seen other values for the parameters, too: +500/-500, etc.

The concept is to give the body more energy and protein on workout days to maintain and build muscle mass, and to force using bodyfat stores for BMR on rest days.  

Have I got this correct, so far?   Basically, it combines bulking and cutting into a single protocol, which varies depending on whether one is working or resting on that day.

Anyhow, the last couple weeks I've been adding exercise to the regimen as that weight loss was entirely through diet. I basically do a full body, weights only workout on Mon/Wed/Fri and plan on mixing in cardio and ab workouts on Tue/Thu (15 minutes of HIIT followed by ab exercises).
Diet is still keto but I've realized I've been eating less since I'm supplementing with protein shakes (totaling about 15g of carbs in a day directly from protein shakes mixed with water). Total protein in grams per day is right around body weight in pounds, if not more if you include dietary protein. I'll eat once either in the morning or right before work (I work at 3PM) and maybe snack on almonds or something at work. I'll usually make eggs in coconut oil with cheddar, sour cream, etc. I'm also taking a multivitamin.

Just wondering if I should be doing anything different? Most people are like deathly concerned about my waist size which went from basically a 34 to 29.

Now that I am fast approaching my goal weight, I'm starting to get more into exercise and thinking more about the sort of body I want vs just losing weight.

I've always been a big guy, not just overweight. According to various online calculators (horribly inaccurate, I know) and looking at a few of the comparison pic sights linked from the [Keto Calculator](http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/) I estimate my body fat percentage to be 24%-27%. If I take it at a worse case scenario, with my current weight (107kgs) that would put me at ~79kg LBM.

According to the keto calculator, with light exercise I should be looking at ~135 grams of protein a day. I eat a ton of eggs and meat, but I sometimes struggle to hit my protein target. On these days I've started taking a protein shake to get my intake up with minimal calories.

At the moment, my main exercise routine involves going on a hike which is approximately 1.5kms of rugged path followed by 1km of stairs to get to the top, and then turn around and go back the same way. Its good cardio but not exactly difficult on the upper body. I do this once or twice a week.

Given that my main exercise is cardio based, should I still be worrying about protein as much as if I was lifting?

(p.s. I am going to start lifting in the not too distant future, just focusing on the cardio at the moment)

EDIT: Looked again at the [Keto Calculator](http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/) and realised that even at the current protein ratio I was eating, I was going to be losing muscle.

My question is about starting some sort of weight training. I'm talking like waaaaay basic. I'm going to go in the gym, go to the weight machines, do some shit and leave. So please don't suggest free weights and advanced things. I'm not there yet. Nowhere near.


When it comes to the weight machines, which do you deem most beneficial? There seem to be a billion of them and I want to find a half dozen or so that will be best. My goal is to build muscle and lose weight. So, that's more weight, fewer reps? Or less weight, more reps? This stuff confuses the hell out of me and is probably why I've never done it.


Some thoughts on the most beneficial machines and suggestions on weight/reps would be much appreciated. I have no idea what the hell I'm doing and all of the materials I find to read seem to be geared more toward those that already have at least some knowledge of what they're supposed to do.

Secondly I read the faq and looked through a bit of comment history but I didnt see what I was looking for. If i missed it, second apology. 

I want to start TKD. Currently my SKD is around 20g of carbs a day around 1800 cal, and i have been doing this for about a month and a half.  So far its awesome but in the last 2 weeks I have gotten back into the gym and I can go forever and not feel a muscle burn.  I stop because i am under the impression I should, as in 12 reps of bench instead of 25 or so.  I also ski, and since keto, no more burning leg muscles, similar to lifting when I push further than I should, I am achy as hell the next day. 

I am looking at TKD because I feel like Im not getting the same effect from a workout that I got before keto, ? bulk?  To me my muscles used to feel bigger immediately and reach their max ""growth"" within an hour or 2 post workout.  Now it seems to take about 2 days before they reach their max growth.  The muscles themselves feel harder on SKD but nor as big or get there as quickly.

They also seem to atrophy faster. before SKD it would be about 6 days before I noticed a decrease, now its 3-4.

Anyway ... I want to try TKD

I was hoping to start with 15 - 20 carbs before the work out and none post workout to see if I want to continue.  Is that a bad idea, should I have some carbs as a post workout or get them from dinner?

In SKD carbs are bad, sugar is really bad.  Is that still the case?  I think a post from a month ago suggested a spoon of honey and as I am looking for something simple I can pick up at walmart that would work?  Also I was looking at some gatorade g2 and it had 20g carbs and 20g sugar, is that acceptable?

I was wondering what you guys use for TKD? I saw some oil listed but was hoping to be able to grab something today after work to use.

I switched to cycling carbs in on the weekends after this period. usually I'll pick any two days in a row, whether it's fri/sat or sat/sun and allow myself to have pizza or sushi meals, maybe pancakes for breakfast etc. I cycle them in to refeed, but don't really go nuts.

I do a lot of light weight high rep weight training, jogging for cardio during the week. I feel like it's been working really well and I've pretty much been watching the fat dissolve while my muscular tissue is thriving. I feel awesome.

I notice that after eating a carb filled meal I become extremely tired. L last night I had a few slices of pizza for dinner, went near comatose and crashed by 10 o'clock.

As far as I'm aware, the idea is that you use it to avoid going into anaerobic respiration, but because it's got such a low glycemic load, it prevents the release of too much insulin, allowing fat metabolism to continue. So, presumably, this stops anabolism in cardio.

My question is, if I did a TKD (I did SKD from February to June, then on and off from June through to October, now heading back into ketosis full time, having gone from 204 to 163lbs) could I feasibly make gains this way - having 20-30g Super Starch on a day where I lift, during the workout, followed by protein afterwards. I'm looking to get lean, and hopefully pick up some muscle eventually.

If this would work (it's a combination of carbs+protein post workout, so I don't see why it wouldn't, unless you need the insulin in order to refeed muscle tissue) then I'm completely sold on the idea.

I don't have the money to join a gym, but I do have some of my own equipment. I have a bench, a barbell, a curling bar, and dumbbells that can all accept the same Olympic plates. 

Before, I just sort of threw together a routine. I lifted 4x/week. This was/is my routine:

Mon/Thurs: 
Bench press
Overhead Press
Seated Triceps extensions
Incline bench

Tues/Fri:
Bent-over barbell rows
Deadlifts
Shoulder Shrugs
Side laterals
Squats (more on this in a second).


When it comes to squats... I want to start doing them with the barbell, but my issue is that I live in an apartment. I'm worried about dropping the bar, etc. especially as I get into higher weights. So basically I'm looking for a new routine or something I can do.

Round one, fight!",thebraken,13,9,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/11ua7m/supplement_sundays_what_do_you_keep_on_hand_round/,"Since r/ketogains has people from the swole bros to the DYEL/HAES crowd just getting started, let's hear what some of your favorite supplements are! Also, bring up any questions you've got about one you were maybe thinking about taking, but aren't sure about.

In future Supplement Sundays we'll get a bit more in-depth about different kinds of supplements, and discuss which brands or types of things are the most effective, cheapest that still work, and all that good stuff, but let's get started sounding off on what we take (or are considering)!

*mod hat: on* I know some people can develop very strong feelings about supplements they dislike, let's keep it civil of course, but also try to refrain from going on rants about how this or that supplement is ""A waste of money, and only an idiot would buy it!"" *mod hat: off*


I'll get this thread started with a breakdown of some that I feel naked without, some that I take on occasion, and some that have just gathered dust.

The Great: These are the ones I take day in, and day out. The ones that I recommend to most anyone who wants to start any kind of training.

- Animal Paks Multivitamin: Really, any multivitamin is good. Mostly I splurge on animal paks for brand loyalty, because I feel like a badass when I take them. That shit has errthing.

- Fish Oil: Yup, just plain old fish oil. I get mine at costco 'cause it's cheap there.

- ZMA: Zinc, Magnesium, and Vitamin B6 all in one capsule. Mostly it helps me get to sleep, and get good quality sleep, but according to people who study things it also helps with muscle anabolism. As an added bonus, anecdotal evidence suggests that it helps you shoot bigger loads. :|

- Creatine Monohydrate: This is one I almost feel bad about putting on my Great list because I don't actually supplement it on a daily basis, but when I'm getting ready for bed and setting up my nighttime supplementation if I reflect on my day and think ""Man, I hardly had any red meat today..."" I'll drop a few grams of unflavored powder into my MiO-water and put my own mind at ease. Some people swear by it, some say it's worthless, I say it's cheap and if I get too much I don't mind paying an extra couple cents for every time I go pee.


The Good: These are the ones that I keep on my shelf for those times when I feel like I need them, but I don't feel like I get enough out of them for daily consumption, they're too expensive for it, serve a specialized purpose, or used to be on my Great list until I forgot them for a while and didn't start losing dem gainz.

- Glucosamine, Chondroitin, and MSM: When my joints start to ache, or my tendonitis starts to act up, I'll chomp on some of these. Pretty cheap, and I've heard people talk about using them prophylactically, but they don't fit in my six day pill holder deal, and I'm lazy.

- Melatonin: This one serves a similar role to the ZMA, in terms of helping with sleep. In my experience it makes me slower to wake up in the morning, though, so I tend only to use it when I know I'm going to have trouble getting to sleep after a long day, or if I know I'm not gonna care that I slept in.

- Psyllium Husk and Acidophilus: When I'm doing a big refeed on CKD, or just having troubles with regularity, this is hands down my go-to supplement. Not really worth keeping in my daily rotation, though, 'cause I like to have some time spent outside of the bathroom.

- BCAAs: Right now it's a tub of Optimum Nutrition's unflavored instantized. BCAAs are almost side by side with Creatine for me in that I use the powders with about the same frequency, they're only making the Good cut because I almost never think to myself ""I wonder if I've had enough BCAAs today?"" I've heard they're a godsend for fasted training, but never noticed a difference personally.

- Amino Acids: Very similar to BCAAs, but with more than three acids. I keep them in my car and take them with meals when I remember to, but I don't panic if I forget. Mine are the Universal Beef Aminos which I picked up on sale at my Friendly Local Vitamin Store.

- CoEnzyme Q10: I've heard this one is the best thing ever for cardiac health, I've also heard that it's snake oil. When I take it, I generally observe a lower resting heart rate.

We've hit the point in the ""Good"" list where most things I list are going to be things I've heard most or all sides argue reasonably convincingly about (Great vs Meh vs Worse than Hitler)

- Rhodiola: The thing that convinced me to give Rhodiola a shot was an article pointing out that it was something my Viking ancestors sought out. (Might have been? I forget the proper wording.) I gave it a shot, and must have kept taking it for some reason, though I can't quantify what difference it made now that it's been a few months since I stopped.

- Tribulus terrestris: I heard about this one from Jamie Lewis' controversial blog (Chaos and Pain), and he swears by the stuff for an increase in Testosterone production. I managed to find it for fairly cheap along with some dozen or so other herbs in an in-store brand's ""Botanical Formula for Men."" Along with Rhodiola it's one that generally has a spot in my daily rotation, but I don't rush to the store to buy more when I run out.

- 5-HTP: Not one I keep constantly on-hand anymore, but it's another of those sleep-support supplements. It only works for me when I use it in conjunction with the other two, or NyQuil, so if it's on sale I'll usually pick a bottle or two up.

- Fat Burners: When I have them, I take them. When I don't, I don't. If I feel like I'm plateauing, or if I'm trying to drop weight faster I'll pick some up. They're no magic bullet, but I've always felt like they do have an effect.

- Caffeine: 'nuff said. I keep some caffeine tablets in the car for those days when I'm just dragging ass walking up to the gym.

- Pre-Workout Drinks: They're almost universally carby as all hell, and I rarely ever use them, but some days choking down a foul tasting neon fluid is just the thing to put you in the mood to heave some serious iron. Seriously, imagine you're drinking an experimental Super-Soldier Serum and let the placebo effect do it's work. &gt;:D

The Ugly/The Misunderstood: There are a number of supplements I've acquired over the years because they were free, or too cheap to not pick up ($1.50 for a three month supply?! How could I say no!?) or that I actually paid for, and wound up regretting it for one reason or another. This is their Hell. There are also some that I picked up on someone's recommendation and never really bothered to look into, and so they're on my shelf waiting, watching...

- Vanadyl Sulfate: This is really the only ""Misunderstood"" on the list, when I was just getting into lifting one of my buddies told me wonder stories about it, then the guy at the Friendly Local Vitamin Store gave an approving nod when I bought it, but for the life of me I don't know what it does. And since I end up with white streaks/spots in my poop when I take it, I don't really take it until I forget about that part again.

- Cutting Gel: Yep. I read the ad, and bought it. It didn't do shit. In doing some research on the active ingredient it seems that what it actually does is temporarily dehydrate the subcutaneous tissues, or something along those lines, so I suppose if you wanted to touch up a vanity spot for a day at the beach or had a photo shoot coming up it could come in handy. Definitely not the wonder stuff they bill it as.

- Resveratrol: Really I'm just kind of bitter that I didn't realize I bought it in liquid form, and haven't taken it because it wants to be refrigerated after I open it. :\



And that concludes a brief tour of my supplement shelf. I also have protein powders, but those are almost implied.

This is, I think, the perfect ""graduate program"" for ketogenic dieters.

Stats: Male, 22, 6'5"", 190 pounds last I checked (although that was, like, a month ago.) I started C25K a few months ago, and finished it 2 weeks ago. Since the last week of the program, I've been running a little over 3 miles 3 times a week with the goal of improving my 5K time (currently 32:45.) This week, since I felt like I had the energy/endurance, I added in 1 mile runs on the days between my 3 miles.

Before C25K I was entirely sedentary. The only notable movement/exercise I have performed since my loss (started on New Years) are a couple of dance classes (1 ballet, 1 modern, each once a week,) pilates (classes twice a week) and jiu jitsu (also twice/week.) All of my classes, which were college classes, ended in May and then I started C25K in July-August.

I've been on a standard ketogenic diet since New Years, with a month's break in June (money/moving issues.) Lately, I've been noticing an increased appetite - not just after a run, but across the board. Meals that used to satisfy my hunger for an afternoon leave me feeling peckish 2-3 hours later. I find myself craving carbs/sweets when my hunger peaks.

I've heard advice that running should not be used as a platform for ""I've been running, so I deserve [x] amount more to eat!"" I'm wondering, however, if this increased movement regimen is affecting my appetite or if others have experienced a similar notable increase. I'm also wondering if this appetite increase is ""proportional"" to the exercise, or if I will need to start keeping tabs on caloric intake and ""going hungry"" for periods of time each day. For the first 6 months of keto, I haven't tracked calories, and followed the ""eat when I'm full"" rule, with lots of success. Does this rule no longer apply when the goal is maintenance/toning?

After about 3 months of SKD, I switched to TKD after I originally had near fainting issues when doing morning boot camps. After more reading of topics in here and r/keto, I realized it was likely potassium/magnesium deficiency and upped my intake. That seemed to solve my cramping, but I'd still almost faint on particularly hard workouts.


Fast forward a few months and I've switched to lifting. I had no problems since I was on a beginner program and just trying to get my form right. More recently, I've been getting a little dizzy after straightening up my body from either barbell row or deadlift. Today, it was so strong I actually felt like I was losing my balance (which I think is how fainting goes). The feeling was like having almost all the blood rushing to my head at once. I'm currently just doing Stronglifts 5x5s and am on my 11th week.


My question is this: I have been upping my intake of potassium and magnesium to points where they should be fine. Pre workout I've been drinking a Zipfizz (~30% DV for potassium and magnesium, some caffeine) and eating something like the cheesy spinach and broccoli to make up the difference later in the day. Despite that, I still nearly faint from all the blood rushing to my head. Does this actually sound like electrolyte deficiency or should I be more concerned?


Few more tidbits

Pre workout - Protein bar w/ enough carbs for TKD (Clif Builders w/30) ~40 minutes before, Zipfizz ~20 minutes before

Post workout - Protein shake w/ ~2 scoops, honey mixed in (had to be warmed to mix well)

Go to foods - Wings w/ ranch dressing, creamy spinach &amp; broccoli. Trying a cream broccoli soup this week

BF% - Unsure, likely above 20% and less than 23% based off sidebar 

Age - 30

Sweat - boat loads, which is genetic (father healthy)

Water intake - ~4 40 oz/day (steel water bottle)

Workout in the mornings


Update: Seems like the orthostatic hypotension was the issue. The clenching, as ridiculous as it looked, really helped keep the blood from rushing to my head.

First, thanks for the great subreddit. 

A little background: 5'11, currently 230-240lb, 30%ish BF (I guess, no idea).  I am down from 290 from last year, and earlier this year in April/May I was 210lb.  In that time, I was working out regularly which included a kickboxing routine and, about half way through, started the 5x5 Starting Strength Program.  Around the end of April, I started getting a lot of pain in my right hip which was diagnosed as bursitis.   It took about 2 and a half months to heal, including physical therapy.

I wanted to start weight training again but for the time being squats, deadlifts, and anything similar are out of the question.  My PT said to give it a few more months for anything like that--and I am very inclined to listen to him, I could barely sit down for nearly 6 weeks without pain.  The extent of any current exercise I am getting is 45-60 minute road biking sessions, 3 times a week (also trying to get back on the diet wagon, fell off after the injury).  

I am a big dumb weightlifting dummy.   Can the weightlifting vets give me an idea of exercises to work out my legs without putting so much pressure on my hips? Or a routine?  Are machines a better alternatives? Which ones?  One of the reasons I enjoyed SS5x5 was because it was so simple:only 5 exercises.  Are bodyweight exercises a good alternative for the time being(convict conditioning/big six?)?

This is a weird one, looking for some advice from someone who has been fat, strongish and unsure of what they wanted.

6'2, 300lbs, 26/m, Lifting since christmas steady.
Squat 140kg, Bench 90kg, Deadlift 150kg, OHP/Bent Over Row terrible.

I've been telling myself all year I'm doing keto and lifting weights in order to stop being 36% BF. And I've been lying to myself as I'm still wearing the same pants I was at Christmas. Sure I'm a lot stronger now, but I have almost no cardio fitness still and can feel my heart beating way to fast most of the day.
I will eat keto 80% of the time and cave on weekends or after a long day, not because I don't have food handy but because mentally I can find excuses to shape myself into doing anything I want at the time (i.e. Eat a subway footlong, you squatted 150 yesterday).

I'm starting to believe that I can't mentally do lifting and pure Keto at the same time, but i'm also worried if i'm 'allowed' carbs i'll just go nuts with it as a way to justify things to myself. These days I'll slack off at the gym if a lift hurts too much instead of doubling down and finishing the 3x5 i'll cut corners and do 3x3 or just lower the weight and pump out 3x5. I'm sure this is related to not being squared away on diet and goals but its easy to change your mind when you're under 140kg.

In the past I did C25k and Keto and lost 20kg, felt great physically but I was weak and being huge and week is a terrible feeling.
I'm wondering if there is a way to get stronger and lose weight or If i should work out a routine where the weight doesn't increase every lift and some days are easier than others and mix in cardio.

I'm flip flopping between wanting to be big and strong (relative, not bodybuilder or powerlifter) and wanting to wear normal people clothes and its doing my head in. Maybe a split routine would be better for me mentally, and allow me to keep things straight in my mind but on the other hand if I don't have a feat of strength to mention to friends or family while i'm eating a plate of wings with blue cheese dressing I feel like every other fat person in the world.

Typical ""6-pack-in-the-fridge"" kind of physique.

Anyway, I'm using MFP to track my macros. I used the macro calculator spreadsheet and it's given me the following.

**Carbs** - 22g
**Fats**  - 136g
**Protein** - 113g
**Calories** - 1753 (outside of training I work a desk job)

I'm looking to retain as much lean muscle as possible while following the diet. I don't plan on getting up to 22g of carbohydrates very often so might just take some of the calories attributed there and take on some more fat?

As far as training goes, I lift three times a week, training two muscle groups each time. At the moment I'm doing 5x5 at about 80% 1RM. If I'm feeling funky I'll throw in 10-15 mins of spinning or sprinting intervals in here and there.

Does this look about right? I'm going to try this for a week and see if I'm in ketosis, if so, I'll stick with it and keep an eye on my weight/BF to ensure minimal muscle mass loss.

Questions:

Will a keto diet negatively affect my cholesterol levels? Last time they were checked (April of this year, not on keto but I was lifting a bit) my doctor said I was ""very healthy and have good cholesterol levels""

How does a lack of carbs affect lifting weights/your muscles in general? I've heard that carbs are needed to help remove lactic acid from your muscles, and I noticed I was more sore than usual after work yesterday. 

Is there a general consensus on artificial sweeteners? Are they okay? Which ones?

How much fiber should I be getting daily?

How much sleep should I be getting nightly?

My goal is to make sure I can run for endurance (1/2 marathon this year, hopefully full next), but I do want to increase strength and muscle too (which is why I split the runs from the lifting).

I've been doing SKD since Jan 1st and lost 40 pounds (220 to 180) between then and March 15th. Since then I haven't moved up or down, but as of last week I decided to start lifting and push myself to the 10% bf goal I had by the end of the month. I have measured electrically and with calipers and I believe I am around 14.5% bf right now. Clearly too much weight to lose in a month. However, I will try anyways. 



As of last week I began the following workout routine: http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/six-week-shred-torch-fat-with-hiit-100s.html


I chose to change up the SKD to a TKD, giving myself 25g of dextrose (4 rolls of Smarties) with 15g whey about 15 minutes before my 90 minute lifting session, and again right after my lifting session. (total 340 calories)


I also returned to tracking my calories on MFP and am scheduling 900 calories into a 12-1pm lunch and the remaining 1300 as a dinner within 30 minutes to one hour of my lifting session (typically around 9pm).


I have chosen the calorie load and macros based on the results from ketocalculator

So my question for the sub and its readers is: Is this a satisfactory workout for TKD (I am literally shaking by the end of each workout)? Am I doing the TKD supplementation correctly? Will the dextrose/protein PWO get lost in the subsequent high calorie meal?


What would you change and why?

I've been determined to break the will of genetics, however it's taking a little longer than I had originally anticipated, and I'm wondering if there's a better way to go about this business. 

I don't know if all of the following is relevant, but: I've been doing SKD (~500 calorie deficit) since about mid-January (23/1 IF since April), I did the Insanity videos, I'd alternate between HIIT and LISS, and I did what I could with the shitty universal gym that my apt complex provides.

I went from ~185-190, 18-20%bf to currently 157, 12-14%bf (I'm 6'2 btw), however my fat-disproportion is all too evident still. I just look straight up skinny up top. Like, skinnier looking than I ever thought I'd look. But my hips, legs, and ass are still kinda chunky, which has kept me on this deficit.

I'm starting at an actual gym with a buddy tomorrow which we had planned in February, I thought I'd be leaned out and proportionate by now; ready to eat at a surplus and try to gain weight/strength. We're going to be doing one of those linear progression starting strength type routines, and I'll probably continue with HIIT post workout.

Now I'm not really sure what I should do, I haven't reached the goals/image in my head that I had set when I started. I was kind of thinking that I could continue to eat at a deficit, but pretty soon the weights going to get heavier and I won't be able to progress, plus if I lose any more upper-body weight I don't know if I'll be able to even keep my head from falling off my stupid shoulders. I've read conflicting things about CKD and being able to gain muscle and at the same time burn fat, but that goes against everything else I've read so I'm not sure where the truth is in that.

Does anybody have any personal experience with anything like this? know somebody? Know enough about how everything works to recommend something specific?

Most of my workouts (please don't laugh) are either Insanity (month 2--more intense; I just skipped month 1) or Spartacus 2 (a friend has seen great results, and I'm giving this the benefit of the doubt). They're nothing extraordinary vis-a-vis squats with a bar, but I am getting a nice workout in, getting my heart rate up, seeing my body tightening up, having a good sore body, etc.

My question now is about underconsumption of food. I've thrown my stats into darthluiggi's Excel sheet and am looking at consuming in the upper 1,800 calorie range, with about 150 grams of protein. But I find that I very (very) rarely meet this caloric range, and I'm lucky if I get into the 3 digits with protein. Usually, I'm looking at 1,100-1,500 calories.

Finally my ?: Am I doing more harm to my body by this underconsumption (of protein, especially), given that I'm incorporating workouts into my daily life--even though they're not intense weight workouts? I'm not at the point where I want to start bulking (I still have another 15-20 lbs to reach my orig. keto goal) or doing anything that would signify this, but I do want to begin tightening up my body/get a start on (re)building my muscle (I lost lots of it over the last year as I didn't watch my protein intake and did very little exercise).

Fwiw, I'm 23/m, 5'3, and weighing in the 160-162 lb range. A typical day's worth of meals (boring, but I don't tire out too easily) for me is looking like:

* breakfast: 3 eggs with a serving of pork chorizo
* lunch: 8 oz chicken breast or two 1/4 lb beef patties with lettuce and ranch
* dinner: very similar to my lunch

I'll snack on almonds and peanuts throughout the day, but I certainly don't over-do it. I also have an Optimum Nutrition protein shake post-workout. What are your thoughts on the Isopure Zero Carb line? I've got just a few scoops left of my ON and may check this out in the coming week.

Also, I do my workouts in the morning on an empty stomach, and the shake post-workout. My breakfast is around 11am, lunch around 3 or 4, and dinner before 10 (bedtime is late).

How should I go about this differently in relation to keto?
What would be the benefits and drawbacks of a shake?
Is it even necessary for me at this time?

I did 4 months of keto last year and went from 185lbs to 165lbs with light lifting. 

I got my weight back up to 190lbs this year due to laziness on my part. I've since decided to take things seriously in the gym and have been on keto since early March with kick-ass success. I am down from 190lbs all the way to 167lbs and my lifts are up nicely.

However, when I started doing keto again in March I was having a cheat day on Sunday. I understand this now to be more of a CKD approach. [Link showing my recent cheat days.](http://i.imgur.com/JS4jnw4.png) I was having trouble dropping below 170lbs, so I stopped the cheat day and dropped more weight with no problem.

I think I need to switch more towards TKD and have 30-40g  of carbohydrates pre-workout. I am not sure if I am jumping the gun here or not - maybe I just had a rough week. I know in the FAQ it says you should do keto for atleast 3 months before considering TKD... 

Does my difficulty in the gym seem like a need of carbohydrates? If so, what are some approved foods to eat? Lyle McDonald says to avoid fruit. Does that mean I can have a Milkly Way or a Clif Bar pre-workout? Does it have to be a ""clean"" carbohydrate like brown rice or oats?

I have been reading a lot of the threads about here lately and over on r/Keto and I am going to be starting a keto diet in the next week or two once I get everything set up for it and I just have a couple of questions.

I am a big guy and at the moment I think that I am classified as morbidly obese :(
I haven't weighed in a while but the last time I did I was cresting the 200kg mark and I put my guestimated weight at about 210-230kg at the moment. 
Now I am never going to be a light guy, I have a germanic background mixed with a kiwi background and my mother and father were both tall and broad and all my relatives are tall and broad. 

My goal for being on keto is to lose enough weight to be considered healthy for my build, as well as to reduce the health risks involved with being obese (my mother was recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes) but I also have a side goal of putting on muscle weight and eventually moving into building muscle. 

Now comes the question; When I start my keto diet, should I begin exercise immediately at the start of the diet? Or should I wait until the keto-adaptation has occurred?

And when I do start my exercise, should I be exercising with my long term goal of muscle gains in mind or should I focus on another form of exercise that will provide better weight loss?

And one final question; When it does come time to move into a more muscle-gain oriented workout, do I need to supplement my keto diet with work out supplements to allow for muscle growth or will the keto diet provide everything needed? And would you suggest using supplements anyway.

I've been on Keto for 2 months and I've lost 15 Lbs. I've also been going to the gym, doing mostly cardio with some lifting. However, it's recently come to my attention that by doing too much cardio you can actually lose muscle along with fat. I've read many articles and guides on [Bodybuilding.com](http://www.bodybuilding.com/) which show me certain types of cardio that I can do instead of just jumping on the treadmill. I'm looking to start a new workout routine but I don't know if I'm doing it right, so I was hoping you guys can give me some feedback.

My goal is to lose fat and build muscle. I know I'm not going to get ripped over night but that's the long term goal.

**Workout Routine:**

* Day 2: Lower Body (Hamstrings, Quads, Calves) + Abs
* Day 3: Back, Biceps
* Day 4: Rest

**Cardio:**

I play basketball 2-3 times week and now that it's getting warmer I'll probably be playing a lot more.

I have no problem running on the treadmill or using any of the other machines, but I have come across some other styles of cardio which I think can help me burn fat more efficiently.

I was interested in HIIT but read that it may not be the best thing for me since I'm doing SKD and my carb intake is low. I did find this form of cardio that involves [bodyweight movements (Number 1)](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/burn-fat-like-crazy-with-3-unconventional-cardio-styles.html)

So I'm wondering, how should I incorporate cardio into my workout routine? Should I do the bodyweight movements after lifting? Run on the treadmill and/or other machines?

First, I just want to thank the community. This sub, along with /r/keto and /r/fitness has changed my life, and I can't thank everyone enough. I apologize for the wall of text that follows, but this is my story!

Background: 31M/6'1""/165.6lbs. I've been strict keto for a little over 3 months (I started on 12/26/12). Since then I've lost a tremendous amount of weight. I never thought of myself as *fat* per se more the traditional skinny-fat. That said, I've always had confidence issues with my body image. I went from approx. 215ish to 165.6 (which is what I weigh today). Through that process I've discovered that I had a whole lot of fat all over my body -- not just my gut which has always been the focus of my workout attempts. 

I've been on a pretty strict calorie deficit since starting keto; throughout my weight loss I've consistently dropped my daily caloric intake based on recalculated values. That said, I've never off-set for my weightlifting/exercise. Currently, I've been eating approx. 1680 calories a day, irrespective of daily activity. 

I have a feeling this is drastically limiting my progress; both as to fat loss and strength gaining. I've been doing a modified version of SS 3 days a week and cardio every other day. I also mix in ab workouts here and there, but the major compound lifts of SS primarily handle the *core* workouts. I love running and I know that will also affect my strength gains, but I'm willing to make that sacrifice. I'd rather be lean anyway. I've worked back up to running 5+ miles a couple times a week, and I'm really happy with the progress. I try my best to run fasted.

I've plugged in my values into the ketogains calculator as best I could, but I have a few questions. First, I really am clueless as to how to estimate my BF%. Here are some **[current pics](http://imgur.com/a/LFAbN#0)**. I estimated 18% for the purposes of the ketogains calculator. Does this seem right? Can someone help here? I can post more pics if necessary?

It says on non-workout days, I should consume approx. 1479 to *lose fat.* On work-out days, that should be bumped up to 1950. Question, do I still want to lose fat?! I really want my gut to go away, and for the first time in my entire life, I can see it! So I'm really hesitant to increase my caloric intake until that happens; that said, I'm willing to listen to you gurus. I'm also a little confused on my macros; but I think if I can figure out the appropriate protein amount, the rest will fall into place. 

So there you have it. That's my story. Opinions? Suggestions? Criticisms? Everything is welcome. Lastly, my goals are as follows: to lose my damn gut once and for all! to build muscle; and to generally be in *good* shape. Mainly, I don't want to be embarrassed when I take off my shirt at the beach; vanity at its finest. Summer is fast approaching and I'm willing to do whatever it takes! Here is a pic I took in mid-January approx. 3 weeks after starting keto: **[beginning](http://imgur.com/w5aARG9)**.

- I want to eventually do TKD or CKD so I can train with intensity. But how should I train the first 2-3 weeks until my body adjusts to ketosis and I can start adding carbs for TKD or CKD? I'm sure I'll lose some strength from the lack of carbs. How intense, what rep range, and how many sets? I figure once I can add some carbs, I can increase intensity.

- Same question, just post induction phase and once TKD or CKD has begun? I should not I'm leaning toward TKD so I can lose more fat in a shorter time period. 

- Is there anything I can do today to prime my body for ketosis? I plan on doing HIIT the first morning to deplete glycogen stores. Then switch to MSST for two days, then just brisk walking every morning on top of my weight training.

- Supplements. Can I use a stim fat burner with yohimbine to help mobilize fat from my cells? Or will this be harmful on Keto? And what about Creatine? I take it regularly, but without carbs, will it make it to muscle cells? Will it increase the chance for kidney stones?

- What is the most important advice or thing you've learned along the way that you could tell me from your own experience?

- Will I lose muscle? I know Keto can be protein-sparing if you eat right, and I will, but will training cannibalize muscle tissue if I push too hard?

A bit of intro and why I'm doing keto and what my (very) short term goals are. Also, a deluge of questions coming up!

**Intro:**

New to the board, second time posting but long-time lurker on reddit. I'm 5""9, 148lbs always around 12-15% shifted from Leangains to Keto in hopes of permanently being around 10-12% + I work out 3x a week and have competed in powerlifting meets before. I like Leangains, I really do, but if keto or (ketogains) could net the same results easier (or even better results if only slightly more difficult), then I'm all for that. My own experiences will tell me. 

This is because when I get leaner, I also get grouchier/ hungrier after a few weeks (on any diet), then I usually start slacking on the diet, then BAM back to 15% again! I'm hoping for something easier to adhere to in the long term so I don't have to rebound all the time.

**Long Term/ 1 month goal**

I'm in that really ~~annoying~~ interesting place where some weeks I look pretty ripped but if I mess up for a few days straight (like now), my abs take a vacation. So I sometimes have abs and sometimes I don't but I'm closer to the latter side now.

I have a cruise in a month and I'd like to get as shredded as possible for that, so that's a 1-month goal. To do that, I was gonna do the APD (Jamie Lewis's Apex Predator diet), which I've done before, but it isn't exactly easy to to for a long time. If there's a more relaxed way to drop bodyfat at the same rate, I'm all for that!

My question comes from this statement from Joseph Arcita's guide to ketosis:

&gt; ""1G. One Will Lose Body-fat More Quickly on Keto Than Not ↑
The brain requires or uses rather roughly 20% of daily maintenance energy. Under glycolytic conditions the predominate form in which the brain accepts energy is glucose or glucose derivatives. In other words at least 20% of energy expended daily under a glyclytic metabolism must be taken from dietary or stored glucose. Under fat-adapted ketogenic conditions at least 80% of the energy used by the brain is in the form of (fat-derived) ketone-bodies.

&gt; As well under ketogenic conditions one will sweat, excrete, and exhale fat-derived ketone-bodies which can account for up to 100 kcal of energy lost per day.

&gt; **Say that a hypothetical person requires 3,000 kcal in order to maintain his weight. Each day this person if under a ketogenic metabolism would lose an additional 580 kcal of fat than he would have lost if he had not been under a ketogenic metabolism.""**

Just to clarify, is the last paragraph what is referred to as **the** ""metabolic advantage"" of keto? 

Like, when people say ""you start using fat for fuel in keto"", they are referring to the **brain** shifting it's use fuel use from glucose to ketone bodies to provide a **fat loss of ~20% of maintenance kcals daily?""**

So, the person above is set to lose **1 extra lbs of pure bodyfat every 6 days just by virtue of being in keto?** Meaning, if the person above was eating **the same calories on another diet**, that he would be missing out on a 1lbs of fat loss a week?

I apologize if my questions above are nitpicky and redundant, but I'd like to understand what exactly people mean in numbers when they say ""keto uses your fat for fuel instead"".

In my case, with a maintanance of *2k kcal, I would expect 400g of fat used in a day/ 1 lbs of fat lost every 9 days or so. In one month, that would 3 lbs of fat without necessarily being in a deficit.* With a proper deficit going, **I might be able to lose 4 or 5lbs of fat (provided I don't mess up), which is significant.**

Not sure how realistic the above sounds to those with experience, but it's worth a shot. 4lbs of fat in a month is pretty significant for me.

I hope I don't bore you guys with the all the math above. Thank you and best wishes,

I've been doing keto for about a year, started at 211 and went down to about 179.  Then a few months back I started to work out a heck of a lot harder, and I added in creatine (loaded for a week w/ 20g, now do 5g a day except Sundays) and I shot up to about 184, which I expected.  But since then I haven't lost ANYTHING. In MONTHS.  I started tracking on MFP (grossitsrachel is my name) and was eating around 1,500 calories a day because I thought I needed to cut calories to lose.  But then I started reading up that I wasn't eating ENOUGH calories, and I should be having about 1,950, so I upped it... still nothing.  

I generally have about 1,900 calories, 140g fat, ~20g carbs, 120g protein every day.  I never cheat. 

My workout is as follows:
* M&amp;W - Pushups &amp; BO Rows, Bicycle Sit Ups &amp; Planks
* T&amp;Th - Tabata Sprints, Weighted Squats &amp; Weighted Lunges, KB Swings &amp; Shrugs (I have bad shoulders/neck, trying to slowly strengthen them)
* F - Bikram Yoga
*Sat - Hike w/ weight (Usually 3-5 miles, depending)
*Sun - Rest

During the week, I do those workouts very quickly. I do all of my sets interspersed. So... Squat set, Lunge set, Squat set, Lunge set, etc.  I don't rest in between, they're pretty intense. 

I do all of these workouts in the morning while in a fasting state (I have coffee right before, but with nothing in it, as I've read caffeine is good pre-workout), and I drink a protein shake with heavy cream in it right after.  

I'm getting married in less than 4 months, I would really like to be losing more. I'm getting very frustrated that I'm not losing weight (OR inches), though I am getting stronger and I'm happy about that. 

What am I doing wrong?! Why am I not losing anymore?! HELP! ;_;

TLDR; Eating all the right macros, working out a lot, still maintaining weight/inches. Help.

Now, I feel that my goals have changed slightly from simply losing all that excess fat to starting to build muscle while keeping a cutting mindset and lose this last bit of fat.  I finally joined a proper gym last week and can start doing some heavier lifts. Also, for the time being I'm going to stay with SKD, don't see the need to change that right now.

Here's the problem: I do not have access to an actual gym, but a small room with a treadmill, some small dumbells that might go up to 40lbs, and some type of sitting press machine. I just ordered some resistance bands to use in my own room that go up to 75lbs resistance. My strength training routines have been using the weight machine, then curls, and the  exercise that mimics the motion of pulling a lawnmower cord (sorry, don't know the name). When I do legs, I hold weights, do two types of squats, and forwards and backwards lunges. I'm up to week 6 on C25k.

On workout days my meals: **Breakfast** consists of 2 eggs, 4 slices of bacon, and bulletproof coffee (3tbsp of butter, 1.5tbsp of coconut oil). **Pre-workout meal** is 210 calories worth of raw almonds and 4tbsp of banana granola nut peanut butter, about 380 calories. **Post-workout**, I drink a broth of no salt and chicken stock for sodium and potassium, and eat about 1/2lb of turkey (99% protein, 1% fat) and a full pack of frozen cauliflower/broccoli, 120 calories.  **Dinner** is usually another 1/2lb of the same turkey, 3 cups of baby spinach, with 3 tbsp of ranch dressing. This normally puts me somewhere around 160g of protein and fat, and 30g of net carbs.

I feel like I'm getting a bit bulkier, but actual weight loss is very slow if it happens at all each week. Am I eating correctly? I'd like to have a set of exercises that I know to do that I can do with resistance bands or the dumbells and press machine. I plan on switching to a much more HIIT set of running after I finish C25k.

I've tried to do body weight exercises but can't manage to do pushups because my wrists just seem to give out and hurt any time I try. So I got a Grip Master to help with wrist strength, and bought a jump rope for additional methods of HIIT.

I've been in ketosis since december and Im feeling really great.
My goal isn't really to lose weight I'm at 70kg (155 lbs), but to up the muscles and drop the bf to below 15% (visually estimated 20ish% atm). I'm also pretty adapted as far as I know from my (now abandoned) cardio sessions.

Keto meals are fine I even lost 5kg that I didn't think I need to lose.

Workout is somewhat restricted as I'm 16 y/o and can't go to the gym more often than 2 times a week. :/

What I'm doing is only lifts, precisely: Deadlifting, Squats, Bench, Push- and Pullups(chin ups for now :D). Can't do many reps here because I feel rly exhausted fast.

At home I could only do cardio and bodyweight exercises.

Today I ""tried"" the TKD in my p. e. class and it was pretty good for the HIIT stuff.

So for a total under $15, and with a little bit of your own time, you can make a pretty decent facsimile of products that cost 4-5 times the price. Instructions are as follows (I tried to get some decent pictures):

1.	Cut your PVC to desired grip length using a hacksaw or pipe cutter (Lowe's/Home Depot may let you use one of theirs if you don't have a tool collection. If not, they aren't THAT expensive and a hacksaw has myriad uses around the house). I recommend trying to use some sandpaper (even if its coarse grit) to remove the burrs that result, but they shouldn't do too much harm to your DIY product's lifespan.

2.	Open your straps and lay them out flat.
3.	Take the strap, thread the PVC onto the open end ([Finished Handle](http://imgur.com/a/PAv6J#2)), and pass the strap through its own buckle as detailed [here](http://imgur.com/a/PAv6J#3)
4.	Once the strap is fairly taut, fasten the loose end to the doubled over buckle area using sturdy safety pins (NOTE: you should ensure that the strap will go through the buckle the right way once you have it completed. That is, one direction MAY allow the buckle to slip, you want to put the strap through in the direction that will make tension pull it tighter into the buckle's teeth (this should be fairly obvious upon inspection).
5.	Assuming you know basic sewing skills (As evidenced [here](http://imgur.com/a/PAv6J#4) my sewing skills are not optimal), sew the secured halves together (I went overboard and used ~2-3ft of thread on each strap to make sure it would hold my weight, hopefully my pattern is somewhat visible, but I can try to explain it better if someone wants to know (it isn't really anything complicated)
6.	Once everything is sewn together, remove the safety pins and repeat for the other strap. [Finished Strap](http://imgur.com/a/PAv6J#5)
To use the straps, just loop them over whatever you're hanging them from, secure the loose end in the buckle, and adjust to the desired length. There will likely be a long tail on the end, which you may cut off and burn a little to prevent fraying if you desire.  [Here](http://imgur.com/a/PAv6J#6) is a picture of the straps in action. 

I apologize if any of the photos are a bit blurry, I sort of did this a little quickly with my cell phone camera, since I don't have access to anything better.

I honestly haven't lifted or exercised ""seriously"" since High School.  I graduated in 2003.  On Monday 1/21/2013 I began my workout regimen.  I started with the idea that I was going to do 1 hour on the treadmill and workout everyday (alternating between upper body, core, and legs).  After day one I was completely exhausted so I decided to take a more relaxed approach.

So my plan is to exercise 6 days of the week, with one ""free"" day.  I'm going to alternate cardio with lifting, so it will end up being 3 days of 1 hour treadmill, and three days of weight training.

I'm still getting used to weight lifting, I want to do low weight high reps for the cardio/endurance aspect, which is difficult for me now because I'm used to the whole muscle confusion strategy.

I also had to modify my diet, I'm eating 2k cals a day at 65/30/5 macros in order to meet 175++ protein (my lean mass is apparently 213).  Previously I was eating anywhere between 1200-1700 calories a day, but without the high protein.

Anyway, that's the back story.

I weighed myself this morning with a 6 pound gain.  This is a scary thing because I had about 133 pounds left to lose to get to my ideal weight of 240.

Can I assume these 6 pounds are muscle gain?  I can definitely say that I was WEAK when going into the gym, not even close to how strong I was in High School.

How long does the initial period of weight gain due to muscle last?  Can I expect the pounds to start melting off at some point again?

Please share your opinions, experiences, or anything that may be helpful.  It will all be appreciated.

Thanks /r/ketogains!

So my question is this...
Can we potentially use straight fructose in the form of a powder or tablet instead of using MCTs? I am offput by the idea of eating straight coconut oil, it's a texture thing.  I am also having a hard time finding literature to support or deny my idea, and considering I do not know how long it takes for fructose to effectively be converted to glycogen in the liver, I know it is more practical to use MCTs.

I take 500mg first thing in the morning with a B-complex, and another 500mg mid-morning.  Doesn't seem to make me jittery and has improved my concentration.  I haven't noticed any change in effect to my workout program...it doesn't make me feel all jacked-up or anything, more of a low-level background boost in awareness...like the brightness has been turned up a bit on my monitor.

I'm also taking L-Tryptophan in the afternoon/evening though, which is generally an anti-stimulant, but also a mood-lifter, so its possible they cancel eachother out to an extent.  I haven't found anything around L-Tryptophan lowering metabolism and it hasn't seemed to impact my afternoon lifting, but maybe that's something to watch for?

First my stats:

* Age: 24
* Weight: 225 lbs
* Goal Weight: 210lbs
* Height: 6'4""
* BF%: ~24% (based on picture references, my scale puts me at 17%, which I assume to be incorrect)
* Time spent on keto: I've been off and on for about 2 years, but have gotten more committed to it as a lifestyle change in the last 3 months.

My eating:

I don't keep strict track of my macros but from the MyFitnessPal calculations I do a couple of days per week, I'd put my diet at around 80% fat, 15% protein, and 5% carbs. I've used the Macro calculator and am pretty far under the recommended protein intake for my LBM, though that hasn't prevented me from some great newbie gains. 

So here's my situation:

I've successfully completed the first 12 weeks of the SL5x5 program and the results have been pretty incredible. In addition to SL, I've been doing 30 mins of HIIT 5 days a week, on lift days I do it after lifting. I've plateaued on most of the lifts at this point and am thinking that it might be time to move on to a different workout that might help me better reach my fat loss goals. The only question is: what workout should I take up? I really enjoy SL5x5, and have also considered just upping my protein intake and sticking with the workout. What would you recommend ketogainers?

**TL;DR** I'm plateaued on SL5x5 after 12 weeks, haven't reached my fat loss goals, and need help deciding whether to adopt a new workout or to up my protein intake and stick with the routine, as I really enjoy it. 

**Edit:** changed my ratios so I'm not eating 110%

**Edit 2:** Thanks for all of your help and input guys. After taking in all of this info, I've decided I'm going to make the following adjustments: 

- Stay with the SL5x5 program and follow the advice for failing out on the website (I've taken a couple of weeks off so I might drop about 20% from all of my lifts and get a fresh start of sorts).
- Only do HIIT on lift days, and do LISS or MISS on days in between (I'm an exercise fanatic, if I don't do something every weekday, I feel out of whack).
- Pay more attention to my macros and make sure to hit my protein intake according to the macro calculator, and adjust calories around that for fat loss.

started over with keto again like 1 1/2 weeks ago.I dont really need to lose weight, im 1,79 and weight ~73 kilos at the moment and im well trained. The reason i do keto is to get my bodyfat below 9%.
To give you a better overview of my calorie needs i shortly describe my usual day.
I go to work by bike every day(when its not raining), thats 11k one way and on the way back a very steep hill for 2k, which is quite exhausting.

Thats about ~120k of biking each week.

Monday: 45min abs in the gym at lunch, ~1 hour weight lifting after work (Wendlers 5/3/1 atm) 
Tuesday: ~20min yoga @lunch, 5/3/1 after work 
Wednesday: ~20min yoga @lunch, BJJ after work Thursday: ~20min yoga @lunch, 5/3/1 after work
Friday: 45mins abs at lunch 
Sat/Sun: REST and occasionaly climbing, longboarding and the usual weekend activities.

Under the week it quite varies. I just start this routine now so i might change it again due to not enough rest, maybe have one more rest day on Tuesday and move this 5/3/1 to the weekend or just leave it for 2 times a week.

The rest of the day i spend sitting on the desk by the way. The reason why i post my training schedule is that i would like to ask you guys how much i actually need to eat.

I quite know WHAT i should eat, i manage to stay below 50g of carbs a day at the moment (sometimes barely over when 1 or 2 glasses of wine sneak in on the weekend)

My nutrition at the moment:

Breakfast: mostly every day a 10% fat greek joghurt with 2.8 carbs per 150g serving, i add a few frozen berries and little bit of stevia and cinamon. To that i mostly eat about 100g of cheese ( camembert) and about maybe 20 nuts (Pistachio or Almonds)

Lunch: mostly a huge bowl of green salad, the ingredients vary every day, mostly avocado, cheese, chicken, tuna. The good stuff. I just use olive oil and lime juice for a dressing, sometimes some joghurt one.

Evening: i try to eat there red meat as often as possible. Mostly ground beef mixed with different kind of veggies, overbaked with cheese, or a curry, or a salad again, lots of nuts in addition and sometimes a bit of wine and cheese and olives. (And sometimes a scoop of peanut butter) :)

Additional to that after training sessions low carb protein shakes for sure.

For snacking i only eat nuts. God i fucking love nuts, almonds and pistachio.

I eat at least 100g nuts every day. Can easylie say that, i dont know if its a problem tho, i always feel bad when i eat those nuts :(

Today i changed my breakfast a little bit as i always got hungry at about 11 o clock already again:
3 slices of bacon, about 110g of cheese, 2 eggs, the mentioned joghurt and about 20 pistachios :D
6g of net carbs and 750 calories, i feel very guilty right now :D

I really look forward to get some advice from you guys for my daily calorie intake.

I can manage to stay within the carb range, but i barely go over 1800kcal a day and i think my body might need more...

Thank you so much guys, by the way im not just a skinny guy who complains about 2% of bodyfat, i weighted about 110kg about 7 years ago before i started to change my life.

Over the last year, I've lost over 100lbs. About 45lbs of that was on keto and the rest being a strict 1200cal per day limit with about 2 hrs per day of weights and cardio. Both were very effective. I look like a pretty normal person (albiet chubbier than I'd like) now (from 300+ to around 200 at 6'3""). I'm ready to start doing more of a strict weight lifting routine and doing a body recomp. I'd still like to lose weight while lifting. I'm not looking to get jacked at the same time, but even some small gains and more muscle definition would be nice.

I'm mostly wondering, from people who have experience, what kind of diet will work better for this sort of goal? Generally trying to decide between keto (higher protein and fat) or a calorie deficit (with clean meats and complex carbs). I'm not really sure which would be better for what I'm hoping to accomplish.

I know that on keto, I generally lose weight much faster than calorie restriction but I'm not sure if that's such a good thing for a recomp.

I'm aiming to lose 40lbs more, but I've already lost around 43lbs since January thanks to keto. Right now I'm at 1200 cal, but I'm thinking of bumping it up a couple hundred more to take into account the weight &amp; cardio training I am doing. Macros are good, according to the MFP ratios I manually entered.

At this point, outside of having a very active job, I didn't do much exercise. My goal is to not just be smaller, but have a much nicer body. Small, tight waist &amp; a nice booty (currently suffering from pancake rear). I would like to aim for the muscularity of the fitness models in bodybuilding competitions, if that's any help. 

I'm still cutting, planning to stay on SKD, so not expecting to add muscle, but if I can at least maintain what I have, maybe when the rest of this fat leaves, I'll like the shape I'm in and won't have to start from scratch building muscle. :) 

Caveat: I can't go to a gym. Finances, childcare &amp; working opposite shifts from hubby make it incredibly difficult. If it's difficult, I won't do it. I have access to a weight bench (adjustable to decline &amp; a couple different inclines), adjustable up to 40lbs each hand weights, a pull up bar, and some resistance bands. A weight bar &amp; plates are out, there's not much room for them and the needed power cage. :) 

So far I've added 30 min of biking (on my stationary bike), getting in at least 7 miles, hopefully more as time passes. Cardio has never been my problem, though. I'm a cardio-high addict. lol Since I've been keto for 7mos, I don't find it difficult to do cardio. Guess that means I've adapted?

Strength training, so far, this is what I've put together: 

Day A: 

Regular Lunge
 
Reverse Lunge 

Squats 

Row (regular &amp; low) 

Pull ups (can't do these yet, working up to them by slinging a leash over the pull up bar &amp; doing inverse rows) 



Day B: 

Hip thrusts 

Dead lift (modified due to dumbells, thinking of getting a bag of sand too for it, no space for a bar) 

Dips 

Push ups 

As I get better I will modify the exercise to make it 'harder' either by adding weights or changing angles, etc. I will lift heavy (trying to keep my total reps to 25 max). 

Am I missing anything? The workouts right now are hard, and I am incredibly sore afterwards, but I know that's not a sign of a good workout. It also doesn't take me long to do them (around 30 min) and my past experience with strength training is the total opposite. Those would usually take for.ev.ah. 

I guess I am unsure due to the small amount of different exercises + total time to complete them means I'm missing something big &amp; important.

Apologises in advance if this has already been discussed heavily in the past. I'm currently trying to wrap my head around fat intake on workout days. (Background to help - Female with the goal of cutting hitting heavy weights twice a week to preserve as much muscle as I can. Normal day macro spilt 1200cals 15c/80f/105p.)

Today I hit the gym and did a complete depletion workout first thing this morning fasted. During the workout, I had an intake of around 35g of whey (25p, 2f and 5c). 

Since I'm confused about workout days and fat consumption, I got a little scared of intaking normal amounts of fat today, so I had a post-workout meal of oats, eggwhites and whey consuming about 34g of carbs.

What am I meant to be doing for the rest of the day? Intaking protein and carbs or sticking to my normal daily keto macro spilt? Keeping cals in deficit to keep cutting? Should I be consuming post workout carb meal at all? I've read a lot across bodybuilding forums, the wiki, and the web to try and understand what my workout days should be spilt wise, but I'd sitting here dumb founded and still confused. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. ",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,False,,,True,t3_1fg6u0,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1fg6u0/timing_of_fat_intake_after_a_workout/,

Advice please?",brosephJ,7,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1efmpr/returning_to_the_gym_after_a_long_break_and/,"Okay, so due to financial and medical issues, i had to take a long break from eating well and working out. I worked out on and off from January until about 2 weeks ago. 

So, I weigh 215, im at about 26% body fat, and im super bulky due to weightlifting for years in the past. I have lost some of that muscle mass, but not much. Losing fat is a priority for me, but I definitely want to maintain/gain muscle mass. 

BUT, the problem is that for now, my finances are still very tight....like, I've had to give up quite a few other memberships and activities in order to afford a good diet and a gym. I came across the rippedbody website a while ago, and it looked promising. But all the carbs that he recommends along with the other things is too expensive for me. 

Then I came across keto and read some testimonies and liked what I saw, so I decided to start. Here is what my diet consists of now:

I am following the 2-meal, 8 hour eating window idea that rippedbody recommended for cutting:

Right after workout: 50 grams of Optimum Nutrition Whey

About an hour later: 8-10 oz of chicken grilled in olive oil, 5 eggs, and 4 thick slices of bacon

Throughout the next 7 hours: 3 sticks of string cheese, 4 oz almonds

Gallon of water every day.

I used all the FAQ's and stuff in the sidebar to help me figure out macros and percentages, and as far as that goes, this diet ""quallifies"" (60%F, 35%P, 5%C) Compared to some of the other diets I've seen on here, it seems a bit small. I've already lost almost 10 pounds in 2 weeks, so I know its working for weight loss, and I feel like my muscle mass has sliiightly increased, but I cant tell if thats just the pump.

My workout is:

Monday: Chest (Incline Bench, Bench, Pec Fly, Dip)     
Tuesday: Back (Seated Row, Lat Pulldown, T-bar Row)     
Wednesday: Shoulders (Barbel Overhead Press, Arnold Press, Lateral Raise, Front Raise)     
Thursday: Biceps/Triceps (Preacher Curl, Hammer Curl, EZ Bar Curl, Chair Dip, Tri Pushdown, Skullcrusher)     
Friday: Legs (Squat, Leg Curl, Calve Raise)

3 Sets of 8-12 for each, except for shoulder day, which is 3 sets of 10-12, and leg day, which is 3 sets of 12-16

I considered cycling in carbs before workouts, but idk if that would help. Is this diet enough to retain/gain? Workout tips are appreciated also. I realize it is minimal and a bit primitave, but between getting EMT certified, volunteering at the fire department and working two jobs, my time allotted for planning all this stuff has been limited.

I've read through the FAQ's and I've got an idea where to start under normal circumstances... but I'm in a bit of a dilemma.

I've been on keto for about 1.5 months now. I've dropped 25-ish lbs and doing great. (Down to 260... Woohoo!) I have a sedentary job, though I feel like I can move around OK when I need to.  I don't dread stairs or manual labor. In fact I consider myself strong. My drive to lose weight came from a point in my life where I needed to make a lot of changes for my physical and mental well being.

Along with weight loss, I decided to leave the I.T. industry and pursue a new career path. I've decided to be a firefighter/paramedic. I've enrolled in school and have been accepted in to the volunteer academy which starts in October.

Here's the glitch... I have to take the CPAT on May 11.

For those of you unfamiliar... the CPAT is the Candidate Physical Abilities Test.

I have to finish all tasks in the test in under 10 minutes and 20 seconds all while wearing a 50lb vest. 20 minutes walking cool down between each event.

Here is the list of tasks:

* Stair Climb - With an additional 25lbs (75 total), use a stair-mill and climb stairs for three minutes
* Hose Drag - Drag an empty fire hose 75ft, turn, drop to one knee, pull fore hose in an additional 25ft
* Equipment Carry - Remove two 30lb saws from a 4ft opening and place on the ground. Carry both saws 75 feet, place them back in the cabinet.
* Ladder Raise and Extension - Raise an aluminum ladder, hand over hand into climbing position. Extend a fixed ladder using a rope pully, and then lower the ladder in a controlled fashion.
* Forcible Entry - Use a 10lb sledge hammer to strike a measuring device until a buzzer is activated.
* Search - Navigate a darkened 3ft x 4ft enclosed maze on hands and knees, sometimes crawling under obstacles.
* Rescue - Drag a 160lb test dummy 70ft
* Ceiling Breach &amp; Pull - Use a pike pull to push up a 60lb ceiling flap three times, and then pull an 80lb weight 5 times. 4 reps.

So pre-keto... I probably could have done OK with this test.

My concern is I wont be physically ready to take this on.

What is the best way to kick-start this and get me as ready as I can be for May 11? I know I can't be superman, and I know this is not an ideal situation, but this is when the test is, and I can't change it. If I miss it... I could potentially stall my career progress for a year or more... and I don't want to do that.

I shoot for a 750-1000 cal deficit, but keep my protein at 1.2g per lb or lean body mass to preserve as much muscle as possible. (I'm okay with losing a little muscle - I gain easily)

Things have been going well so far - my strength levels tanked my first two workouts, but bounced right back around day 5 of keto. 5-15 were great, just couldn't go over 8 reps heavy.

I’m giving a TKD approach a decent shot over the next couple of weeks. Have been really struggling trying to find a happy balance between dropping the last of my fat and still performing to any decent level. I seem to be able to do either one or the other which is starting to wear me down. Every time I have competed in the last few years I’ve dropped weight massively to hit the weight class (moved down 4 different divisions in the last 4 years lol) and then I’m basically the walking dead when I actually step out to fight.

First 3 months of 2013 I was doing a lean gains approach which I had properly setup by Andy at rippedbody.jp – Performance was good (eg: added 15Kg to squat, plenty of energy in sparring etc). Dropped virtually no weight but did lose several BF% points (general downward trend in an inaccurate bio-impedance reading). However having 200g+ of carbs on workout days really made it tough on me for diet adherence – ended up binging a lot of weekends which did not help. I think perhaps because the calorie deficit overall for the week is lower, any non-adherence at the weekends which should have been rest days on a -30% cals just wipes out any progress.  Obviously I still have all the macros he set up so if I can’t find another solution I can move back to this at any time and just do my best with working on the psychological issues I have with carbs.

Lately I have tried going back to a keto approach (which is how I lost the bulk of my weight in the first place) but my performance in general has tanked completely from the previous few months. For instance I was deadlifting last week and put 135Kg (just shy of 300lbs) on the bar for a max reps attempt – did 8 reps the last time I tried that…failed after the first rep. Same thing with squats: couldn’t even get 5 reps at 97.5Kg this week, failed at 3.  BJJ sparring is getting similarly trashed as well which is a slightly scarier prospect as it involves some rather athletic folks trying to dismember me every session and lapsing in concentration/strength is not a good idea!

* 28 years old / 5’11”
* Starting weight was 322 lbs
* Current weight is 192 lbs (loss of 130 lbs so far – primarily a combination of Keto &amp; lower carb Paleo). Whole story and some photos is here: http://joshua-palmer.com/bjj-saved-my-life/the-full-story/
* Body fat is somewhere around 20% I reckon though I’ve honestly no accurate idea given that my bio-impedance scales will show anything from 17-23% and I have very loose pliable skin from the weight loss which makes callipers fairly pointless. Also can’t find anywhere nearby where I can get bodpod or dexa which is somewhat frustrating.

* Purple belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu – also training MMA (ends up being 3-4 sessions per week at the moment).
* Lifting 3x week on a 5/3/1 template (through 6 cycles so far). Recent top numbers before completely tanking were: Squat: 242 lbs x 2 / Dead: 330 lbs x 2 / Chins: BW x 8-10 / Bench: 150lbs x 5 (I have absurdly long gorilla arms for my body which makes push motions weak as hell).

Schedule is this:

* Mon: Bench &amp; chins [AM], mma/wrestling session [PM]
* Tue: Rest (do 100 or so push-ups just to tick over)
* Wed: Squats [AM], BJJ session [PM]
* Thurs: Rest
* Fri: Deadlift [AM], mma/wrestling session [PM]
* Sat: Rest
* Sun: BJJ session [AM] if I happen to be around, usually every other week at the moment.

I have retained the IF eating schedule of 16/8 (2pm-10pm) I got used to with the lean gains approach.

As of this exact moment I am generally staying under 1800-1900 cals on rest days and 2200-ish cals on training days – around 180g Protein/day - no processed food (paleo + dairy framework).

I’m guessing a big part of my problem may be simply nowhere near enough cals on training days?

My TDEE for sedentary is 2250cals (BMR 1800cals) so factor in 2 training sessions on a single day and I’m probably f***ing myself over from the off on those days. When I was doing lean gains, Andy had me eating over 850g of meat a day for about 250g protein!

Plan is to stick with these numbers (or adjust with suggestions from you guys obviously) but add 30g manuka honey pre-training.

I really need to find a balance at some point soon – factoring in a whole bunch of fuckarounditis I’ve been cutting weight in some way or another for 5 years now and I’m just starting to get mentally fatigued. I’d really like to get down to around 180-ish lbs as an absolute low and then start bulking. The end goal is to be as strong as possible in the 194lb weight class (BJJ) which would mean walking around at about 190lbs.

Any general thoughts or advice gentleman? Eat more, eat less? Doing 2 sessions a day should I look at experimenting with honey before both workouts or just AM?

Thanks in advance.

My weight has been stable, but I've seen all sorts of improvements (much smaller moobs, waste down TWO inches. fitting in size 34 skinny pants for the first time ever).
I want to kick it up a notch. Plus I have 2-3 10k runs coming up that I've been training for.

So first, my (crappy and undetailed) workout plan (that needs your feedback and additions):

monday: 10k stamina run (doing 10k within goal time of 58 minutes or less)

tuesday: biceps/triceps/chest

wednesday:5k pace run (doing 5k within 27 minutes or less)

thursday: either drinking (question about this later), or doing pushups

friday: 5k pace run

sat: workout biceps/triceps/chest

sunday: off/light pushups


I do pushups in 3 sets of 25/20/20, or whatever I can do. (I'm tall and lanky so pushups are hard...but I'm workin)
I dont do leg exercises because the running I do is taxing enough and I dont want to impact/ruin my chances of running well in my races coming up.
I drink on thursdays generally...my choice is double rum diets. Once and for all, is it really that bad to drink 1-2 times a week? I admit I go hard (usually have 8-10 double rum diets by the end of the night).

diet:

breakfast:

4 eggs

2 turkey sausage sticks

some slices of chicken with mustard and mayo

glass of almond milk unsweetened

fishoil + coq10 pills



lunch:

fast fresh foods cobb salad with:

-half ranch dressing

-bacon, extra eggs, chicken, all spinach leaves instead of lettuce, avocado, half scoop full-fat ranch dressing

dinner:

very similar to breakfast. sometimes I get a salad from feta and olives.
on workout nights, I have a whey shake as well.

snack:

tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter with a glass of almond milk

weekends are usually a mishmash, but I try my best to keep close to my macros. I'm VERY good at being diligent at keeping carbs down. Havent had bread/pasta/potatos/rice in months.

In any case, my goal is to achieve the following:

sub - 50 minute 10k speed (this is a matter of training. for now I feel good during runs, and there is no fatigue or lasting pain)

unclenched/close to unclenched abs

no more manboobs

If you have any feedback/advice, it's greatly appreciated.

last note: I drink a looot of diet drinks a day...is it really bad to consume more than 3-4 drinks containing aspertame?

For reference, I'm 4'11, 140ishlbs, about 30%bf. 

Diet: about 1200 cals a day, 60-100g protein (high on lift days, low on not lift days). That is total cals, not net, I don't eat back what I burn. Carbs range 20-50g typically, grain/sugar free, but the occasional sweet potato does find its way onto my plate. I consider myself low-carb primal. 

Lifting: Plan is 3 days a week

* **Pull Day** - negative pullups/inverted rows, deadlifts, curls, lying straight leg raises, curls, bent over rows 
* **Push Day** - squats, over head press/seated press, bench press, calf raises, dips, planks
* **Quick Day** squats, deads, bent over rows, dips, bench press

Workouts have typically been high weight/low rep (if I can do 4 sets of 6 I increase weight). My goal is more on losing fat than building muscle, but I do want to be surprisingly strong. 

Current lifts:

* Squat 80lbs
* Dead 70llbs
* OHP 30lbs
* Bench Press 40lbs
* Row 17.5lbs

YES I KNOW I""M A WEAK LITTLE GIRL OK

Lifting is usually followed by 10-15 minutes of cardio intervals, either bike or rowing machine until I can't do it anymore, then lots of stretching. 

Non-lifting days are either a 5k walk or a 7hr shift (I work at a coffee shop, 6.5 hrs are spent on my feet moving around, plus I walk 15 minutes to/from work).

This is kind of long, but I've been saving up my question for a while:

First off, my stats: 6'0"" 30 year old male, SW: 216 CW: 211 BF%16 Workouts: 6x a week (intermediate lifter, strength workouts split in to 3 sections with 1 day rest between cycles, each day 20 mins LISS cardio after lifting.)

I have been doing Keto since January and at the same time switched from my strategy of pure cardio to strength training (previously did standard calorie deficit and cardio, lost about 15 lbs). I have seen some results, especially in terms of gym performance which have been encouraging. 

However, my weight loss has all but been stalled these past few months. I initially lost about 5lbs, but pretty much stayed at that level since. I figure it may have to do with muscle gain, but I have not been eating above my maintenance for over 6 months now so am I right in assuming I will not see much of an anabolic response and therefore shouldn't be expecting to gain any muscle?

I am wondering if I have been eating too few calories or too many. Currently I am doing 2200 calories a day (1959 BMR) and eating the exercise calories earned in MFP, though not all of them most of the time. I measure calories burned by using a HRM and Endomondo, and usually average 650 burned per 60 minute session. 

However, I noticed that my TDEE is 3365 on the Keto calculator and 2200 would bee too low and would cause metabolic slowdown. (I can't figure out why the ketogains calculator is giving me a much lower number at 2400 ish). So I guess my question is, eat more or eat less? Do more or do less?

this is what they say

 ""In order for Quest Bars to be usable as a complete meal, we wanted to ensure that they contained enough fiber to really matter. Almost every ounce of carbohydrate in our bars comes from fiber, which will keep your insulin levels low and your stomach satisfied. Fiber has been shown to do many things such as controlling hunger, improving digestive health and preventing certain diseases.
IMO is a 100% natural fiber derived from plant sources that is very similar to the better known chicory root fiber. The two fiber sources are almost identical in taste, feel and texture but with one minor exception: IMO does not cause any intestinal upset whatsoever even for people with very sensitive stomachs. We use it to make sure that Quest bars can be complete meals for use whenever you want something convenient.""

You can look it up on wikipedia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomaltooligosaccharide

It sounds like a fiber that is partially absorbed. Each bar has ~17g of the stuff. For strict keto people tend to limit each meal to 10g of carbs. I doubt that 50% or more than that is being absorbed.

(SW 211 ~5 weeks ago; unknown BF%...probably around 35?). I started keto about five weeks ago and have been doing well and seeing success. I have been interested in working out for a while but only did some cardio sporadically since last fall. I used to lift often about 4 years ago, lost 30lbs and got in great shape but unfortunately fell out of the routine and ended up back where I started (college...). Since I've started keto, I love working out because I always feel so good. I have a crazy weird schedule between my two jobs so I don't have a typical workout routine, but I try to do 3-6 days per week focusing on major muscle groups: back&amp;triceps, chest&amp;biceps, legs; and cardio for 5-30+ minutes as often as possible depending on my schedule (days I lift I did a 5-10 minute cardio warmup, days I didn't lift I would do 30+). The last week or two I've gotten to the gym less than 5 times total.

I have seen improvement in all areas which is nice. I have recently joined a new gym which is much more conducive to my schedule, and therefore I feel I will be able to create a bit more of a routine for myself.

**I am looking for a simple(ish) yet useful stack to begin taking as part of my transformation.**

As for goals: obvious I want to lose fat, as is the point of keto, and I want to build muscle as well, but nothing crazy like a competing bodybuilder or anything. Frankly I just love the way casual muscles look on my body (as opposed to fat, but who doesn't?) and I love being strong and able to fend for myself. I am definitely already pretty strong, stronger than many average females my age, but I'm also still pretty out of shape and I want that to change.
I have looked over bodybuilding.com's stacks but they specify fat loss vs muscle gain. I want both. So what I'm asking of you, r/ketogains, what would you recommend? The whey powder I have looked at is 1g fat 3g carbs/1g sugar. Is there anything with more fat and/or less carbs? Is there one on their site you would recommend over another for my purpose? Do you suggest I create my own? There are just so many choices, I don't know what is best. I'm looking to spend $100 or less initially, which is why I looked at their packages, but a few dollars over won't be awful either. I'll take any and all suggestions into consideration regardless of price.

5-6 protein shakes @ 40-60g is between 800 and 1440 calories alone. Add in the meals, and you are getting way above most people's numbers pretty quickly. If we just used the lower numbers, 800+1500 is 2300 cals, which is probably not a deficit for most people.

Are black beans acceptable? I see that they have a bit of carbs but they also have a decent amount of fiber. I'm a fan of black beans and I think the protein levels are helpful to get me to bodyweight protein levels. Do that have a good place in the Keto diet?
I've noticed a lot of people on here have goals for large scale weight loss. I'm looking to cut maybe 15 pounds over 4 months, with #1 priority retaining and building muscle. Are my macros reflecting this goal?
Considering my goals, it makes sense to do CKD or TKD. I've read the material, but its a lot to take in at once. If I understand correctly, I should consume carbs before and after workouts, and load up on weekends?(assuming I work a regular schedule) If someone could summarize it in the most simple way that would be helpful.

I've been scouring this sub and I've seen info about good times for fat vs. bad times. So I just want to make sure I'm doing all I can between food and supplements to help myself.

Based on the feedback I got a couple days ago, I've bought some supps. Here's my daily plan. I run or lift 6-7 days/week, alternating days. This is what my day looks like Mon - Fri.

**Lift Days:**

6:45am - wake up  
7:30 - leave for gym, pre workout shake (MCT Oil, NO Shotgun, a few more carbs to get to ~25g)  
8:00 - 9:00 - lift  
9:00 - post workout shake (Cytosport (27g protein, 3g carbs, 2g fat, 6g BCAA's) with water, 5g additional BCAA)  
10:30/11:00 - snack or coffee with fat (coconut oil or half and half)  
12:00/1:00 - lunch (high protein, high fat, fiber)  
3:30 - snack (fat/fiber (almonds)
5:00 - protein (4% fat cottage cheese w/ some protein powder))  
7ish - dinner (lower cal than lunch, similar macros)  
8pm - last call for food/begin fast  

**Cardio Days:**

6:45am - wake up, coffee  
7:30 - leave for gym, BCAAs  
8:00 - 9:00 - run  
9:30 - BCAAs  
10:30/11:00 - protein shake   
12:00/1:00 - lunch (high protein, high fat, fiber)  
3:30 - snack (fat/fiber (almonds)  
5:00 - protein (4% fat cottage cheese w/ some protein powder))  
7ish - dinner (lower cal than lunch, similar macros)  
8pm - last call for food/begin fast  

On the weekends, I drink at least one night. I lift one day, and I do a long run on the other. This long run is anywhere from 12 - 20 miles, depending on how close it is to race day. For runs 12-16 miles, I'll have an energy gel mid-run (25g carbs), for runs 16-20 I'll have 2-3 gels (50g - 75 g carbs) but I don't have many of this length in my plan.

How does this look? What should I change? 

Question: Should I supplement NO Shotgun with additional creatine? Load up phase and all that?


Also, The macros I had been shooting for were based on a deficit and getting 1g protein per lb of LBM, which also worked into the SKD proportions. 

170lb @ 20%FB = 136lb LBM  
Macros:  
1800 Cal  
20g Carb  
136 Protein  
131g Fat  

Should this change?

I'm trying to read and research as much as I can, but I'm just not quite grasping the entire concept of exercising on keto, so was just hoping to get some help with my results from the keto calculator, and I suppose keto and exercise in general!

I weigh 69kg/152lbs, with 19-21% body fat (LBM: ~54kg(120lbs). I've just started hitting the gym; 3x weekly, alongside a cardio (swimming/jogging) routine 3x weekly. My goal is to loose a bit of weight(which all seems to be stored in my beer gut :p) while gaining definition. See these two [young](http://i.imgur.com/DnIpq7v.jpg) footy [players](http://i.imgur.com/f6USxOr.jpg), for a rough approximation of what I'm after. I've been doing keto for 1.5 weeks, and these are my keto calculator [results](http://i.imgur.com/AEXXFH9.png).

Firstly, the keto gains calculator automatically suggests eating 150g of protein because my LBM is less than 68kg(150lbs). Why is this value recommended and unaffected by the protein ratio? At my weight, is the choice of gaining muscle or losing weight unaffected by my protein intake? Currently, the 150g value requires me to eat more protein than fat if I want to maintain, and especially if I want to lose weight.

And secondly, should I only use the bottom 'macronutrients' section for when I want to build muscle? Or should I also use it on my cardio days? 

Third and last, how do I balance losing my excess body fat with gaining muscle? In my head it works by eating under my maintenance requirements on cardio days, and eating above on my lifting days. Is this correct?


Thanks in advance for any help offered.

I've just started a CKD eating plan, at the end of my 4th week. I started out 82.5kg and im currently fluctuating between 79kg and 80kg.

Can anyone experienced with long-term keto dieting give me a heads up if im on the right track?

Meal 1 - 3 Whole egg omelette, 2 sausages (4g carb), handful of cooked spinach, 1 tbsp of olive oil and 1 tbsp butter

Meal 2 - Choc Malt ON Whey 1 scoop in water, 1 tbsp psyllium husks - Preworkout

Meal 3 - Beef Porterhouse steak, 1 cup of brocolli, 1/2 cup of green beans - PWO

Meal 4 - Same as meal 3, depending on hunger maybe a tbsp of PNB

Meal 5 - Chicken/Fish (upto 10g of carbs if I have sauce/marinade), 1 cup of brocolli, 1 cup of green beans

Meal 6 - Same as Meal 2

Keto eating for 6 days, breaking on Saturday for carb up. Not counting anything on carb up (yet!) just trying to fill stores up with as many grainy and sugary foods as possible.

Drinking lots of water all day. Drinking a bottle of water with scivation xtend every workout. I workout 4 days a week (mon-thurs) Push/Pull/Legs splits in the gym. I used to run long distances, but have cut that down now im on keto. 

Usually run 8km on hills at the start of the week. Other cardio is a cycle class and a boxing class on Friday - My idea is to be depleted by the end of that.


Week 1 was really hard, but im now not hungry anymore and my energy levels are fairly high.

From what I've gathered on myfitnesspal, Im hitting close to 3000cals, 30g of daily carbs (not including greens and psyllium husks) and 180g fat and 280g of protein.

My goal is to lose fat (I started at 96kg at the start of the year) and maybe seem some abs before I hit 26! If I make minor mass gains, I see it as a bonus


Im trialing how keto goes for myself, but my trial won't go very well if im way off on my macros OR if I should be dropping some training days. Can someone let me know if im on the right path, or if they had success with a similar diet?

*Also does anyone know if there are adverse effects to distance running while on keto, ie. at least 20km distances?

I would like to know why carbs are necessary to gain muscle. 

From what I've read on the sidebar:

- **muscle gain improves with the insulin response.** 

  - So if you were to eat sugar after working out, you would see more muscle gain. 


  -  The article also mentioned that medium-chain triglycerides work just as well, for instance coconut oil. 


- **glycogen stores are depleted by intense exercise.** 
  
    - In ketosis any moderate or light exercise will use fat.
    - Volek &amp; Finney mention that the longer you use fat for these activities, the higher the threshold becomes until your body resorts to using your muscles glycogen stores. 
    - I couldn't find much science, but it seems most people agree it takes a few days for your glycogen stores to become fully depleted. 
    - Glycogen can be refilled by any type of sugar/carb. The traditional method seems to be CKD/TKD where you go directly to a sugar or carb.
    - Protein should be able to fill the role of replenishing glycogen stores, as almost half of what we eat is turned to sugar via Gluconeogenesis. 
    - Further more, fat which is burned for fuel can contribute to replenishing glycogen stores, as  the glycerol portion of triglycerides is able to go through the Gluconeogensis process as well. 


**TL;DR** : Only high intensity weight-lifting will deplete glycogen stores, and it will do so slowly.

 These stores can be refilled by (part of) fat, and protein. 

Muscle growth that is normally stimulated by insulin spikes (via sugars) can be gain through medium-chain triglycerides (coconut oil for example).

**So why are carbs necessary for muscle gain?**

I have been doing SS for about a half a year now. Currently on a cut (SKD + IF) but this is my plan for when I begin building again. I have a science background so even just learning about this stuff is fascinating for me and please dont hesitate to get technical if need be.

First of all on SS, I have been hitting the wall and feel pretty weak on the SKD

Secondly my SS regime is a touch different. Instead of MWF only, I merely workout every other day. Some weeks I lift 4x, some 3x. 

I plan on doing a CKD when I begin again. Just the CKD no IF. 

I understand that you need to fully deplete muscle glycogen/liver glycogen. I felt that SS is kind of limiting in terms of muscle groups worked (ie lats, rear delts, arms) so I already implement a small 3 x 9 (maybe even 4 x 9 on CKD?) hypertrophy workout every other day at the end of one of my workouts. I plan on refeeding after I have done 2 of these hypertrophy wokrouts per week/9 days. Additionally for what its worth, during these hypertrophy workouts I usually experience failure in one muscle group or another.

I estimate the hitting the wall + 2 hypertrophy-til-failure workouts will be 'intense enough' that CKD is necessary. But currently I just dont know and I am asking the experts. TKD I feel uneasy about since eating shortly before a workout has never made me feel good during the workout.

ANYWAYS, during weekdays for the CKD I assume I am eating at a surplus of calorie levels? how easy is it to overfeed on refeed days? Is there anything fundamental that I am overlooking?

I found some that are great tasting and have zero carbs but I'm wondering about the protein content.  They say they have 7g of protein per 1/2oz but from what I'm reading they aren't made of the best kind of proteins.  So I was wondering if I should be eating them and if so should I even count the protein content of them?

I live out of hotels and eat at gas stops, restaurants and fast food joints which is terribly interesting; however, suffice it to say the excitement and the vaious local cuisines buggered my keto. 3 months later as a joint collaboration between excitement wearing off, and visible muscle growth due to lifting for work, I am excited and dedicated to making a change.

The Plea:

I want to be strong. I want to lose weight (/lose fat, gain muscle). I want the body :D But I am stranded in a unique situation and have limited resources. Help :O

I am looking for meal plans with limited cooking/difficulty or workout routines that can be performed in a hotel room. I need advice!

Hello, everyone - new sign-up here. This is mostly a repost from Lyle McDonald's bodyrecomposition forum, with some changes and probably some different context for here. There are going to be some questions involved, and some history, and some blahblah. Thank you for clicking on this post.


I am 30. I'm not a newbie to exercise. It's been a few years, though I've done more than my fair share of stupid stuff along the way. I started out at 255 lbs. at 5'10"", with a childhood history of overweight. Today I weigh ~180 lbs., which is on the higher side of the fluctuating range of the plateau from this week.


I was fortunate enough to have a DXA done this past spring, in early March. At the time, I was calculated to be 26.2% - not something I'm proud of, but a hard enough kick in the butt that, with a quantifiable measure, I could stop the screw-around-itis and start making the proper, intelligent changes. A month prior to that I was fortunate enough to have an RMR test done (breather mask, CO2 output against O2 intake, should you know the machine). The test wasn't done bereft of food intake (per necessity, these tests were done in the evening, around 6-7 PM, though for the RMR test I'd eaten only at noon). The mean value for REE was 1893 kcal, with an RQ of 0.90 - 68% CHO burn, 32% fat burn.


Upon finishing out the semester, and upon reading (initially) Lyle's Ketogenic Diet book, I set out on said diet. The close of this week will be my sixth week on it. I've seen success. I've enjoyed success. I've not been able to get another set of tests done, but my strength has improved and none of my lifts have suffered. I have no overriding sense of fatigue. My energy levels are fine and have not suffered. My brain works fine, as well - well, read below.


The part of my brain that uses facts knows I'm not eating enough calories. I know my deficit is too extreme, and has been. I know that I've increased calorie intake this past week by about 200/day and have seen nothing but typical daily wavering on the scale. But the scared fatty part of me - the part that got smacked in the face by the combination of a 26.2% body fat and not-great RQ - is terrified at the prospect of increasing calories. This breeds an extreme amount of uncertainty as to what number is right for me and how to go about increasing to that level, which in turn goes back and fuels the fear.


I've read Lyle's articles on the site. I've seen the calculations for maintenance calories. I've downloaded the spreadsheet keto calculator from the sidebar on the - I think it's the - ketogains subreddit sidebar. I've seen all kinds of maintenance calorie calculators via google search. It's all done little to dispel the above, despite this week's facts stating otherwise. I don't mean to - nor do I want to - use it as a crutch. I'm sick of being stupid about this stuff, but I'm unsure as to how to go about it intelligently.


On lifting days (4x/week), it's been ~1700 calories. On non-lifting days, it's been ~1500. The lifting sessions are 30-45 minutes. In addition, there's been a fasted LISS cardio component of around 45 minutes, sometimes twice a day on the non-lifting days, really based on weather. My life is generally fairly sedentary, so if I can get out there and enjoy a sunny day twice a day, I have been.


I know that, prior to moving onto the ketogenic diet, my calories were lower than they should have been. It's the same as I typed above.


Is the proper conclusion I should make be that it's time to move to a full diet break, as detailed by Lyle's article on the subject? If so, how do I decide on a proper maintenance level? Assuming it's going to be quite a bit higher than my current intake, how do I move up to this level? If so, and in conjunction, how do I safely increase CHO intake so as to not screw up my progress thus far? (I like to assume I've made swell progress these past six weeks. I know I look better, and that's the stupid fatty part of me admitting that, even.)


Again, thank you for clicking on this post. Thank you for reading this post, even if you just want to tell me to gtfo and die in a fire. If you've any counsel, thank you in advance. And if I've forgotten anything, or there are any questions or variables which need answers and detailing, I will do so as best I can.

I've done some lifting and cardio on a regular carb-based diet, and have seen some success. However this has left me much fatter than I would like to be, and I know the best thing I can do to prepare for the military would be to lose the weight.

The Canadian military doesn't have too harsh of fitness requirements, so I don't think I'll be focusing on gaining muscle, but more on maintaining it. 

Their minimum is being able to run 5k, and do 20 military-style pushups. 
I can already meet this minimum, but would like to progress to running 10k, and work on strength. 

I was recently injured which has delayed my training, and I bet it will take me a while to return to the 5k and 20 push-up standard. It has been a month now since the injury (my knee), I still cannot run but I can start doing bodyweight training. 

I am a newbie so I expect even on a calorie deficit I should see improvements in my training. 

I expect to have about 5 months, could stretch to 8 or be as little as 3.

I've had great success on keto before, going from 220lbs to 169lbs. I let myself go over winter, and then started bulking to gain muscle -- taking me right back up to where I was.

Worst of all, I was injured 1 month ago (my knee), preventing me from lifting or running, and being depressed from the injury, I ate quite badly. 

**GOALS**

I usually (before the injury) run every other day, and do bodyweight strength training on the days I do not run. 

My goal is to progress from running 5k (which I probably can't do now), to 10k - and to gain strength. All while losing fat. 

When I say gain strength, I know I'm on a deficit, but I think newb gains might help me, as well as just the mental side of things (I know for beginners getting the brain used to lifting can result in a lot of early progress without actual muscle gain). 

**THE QUESTION**

Given my dieting stats and the goals I have, will I be able to do it?
A lot of my goals are cardio based and I'm not sure how running every other day, or even 3 times a week, will effect my diet. 

Additionally will I be able to maintain my muscle, and gain some strength? 

Is there anything wrong with my macros that you would suggest switching? For instance I put ""Lightly active"" even though I am mostly sedentary to account for my workouts. 

I've been comfortable at 1350cal before during keto, but that was at about 178lb and lower -- can I just power through the adjustment period and start there, or should I lower it over time? 

Really, I'm just looking for some guidance and reassurance that I'm not 
screwing this up.

Thanks!

Like many people starting keto, I started to lose weight (BF more specifically). However, I do want to start hitting the gym in the near future and help myself tone up a bit. I don't care about massive bulking muscles, but a nice firm defined look.

I'm currently in the 2nd week of keto, so I understand I'm nowhere near ready for TKD or CKD (I did read the FAQ), but since the FAQ mentions SKD basically maintains muscle mass, is there any point in me starting a light workout routine on SKD or should I just wait until I hit my GW and then move into a TKD style diet? If it's okay to start a light workout on SKD, how long should I wait before I start that? I know my body is still in the adapting stages of keto, so I don't want to hurt myself at the gym.

I started around february with the goal to get down to 8-9% bodyfat, because i never managed to get lower than 13-14%, but i was able to hold this for a long time.
So I started my cut, in february, on a CKD, but I could never hold back on the refeed day so my weight decreased on the first 6 days, but went back up on the 7th day.
About 3,5 weeks ago I switched to a SKD. Since I like to organize my meal plans I made a Excel programm wher I can insert my data and it helps me to structure my meals. I made around 5 different meal plans so I can rotate them.
This means I always now hom many calories (and C/P/F) I eat. I managed to stick exactly to the plans I made.
The first 2,5 weeks my weight didnt change that much, but at the end of the third week I suddenly dropt down very fast. 
I weight and measure myself every morning after I go to the toilett. I lost about 3kg and 3cm around my lower abs.
So now to my question.
About two days ago I ate my normal meal, but this one time I could not hold back and ate about 600-700kcals, above my normal calories, worth of almonts and cashew. Since 1kg of fat hast around 7000-7300kcal this could be around 95g of bodyfat (not likely since I am in a deficit ... so maybe around 200kcal above maintenance).
After I went to the gym I ate my last meal of the day. Accidentally I used alot salt on this meal (normaly I dont use any salt at all) + I made it with feta cheese (which is already pretty salty).
The next day when I woke up I was about 1,5kg heavier than the morning before.
Is it possible that I gained this much waterweight due to the higher salt intake ?
Or could it be that it was due to the nuts. Almonts and cashew, both have a few carb. I guess I was at about 45g of carbs at that day. Normaly I am around 20-30g?
This really bugs me, because I havent lost that weight jet.",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,False,,,True,t3_1god1v,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1god1v/question_about_salt_and_water_retention/,

Started off this morning with some bulletproof coffee and an atkins vanilla shake(shit is so delicious). What should i do about excercise though.  I hate cardio but I'll still do it if need be. I though running was bad for retaining muscle because you just burn the glycogen from your muscles and then break down your muscles for energy after that. What should I do?

-I am primarily interested in losing fat first. I am currently around ~18-19%BF, and I'm interested in getting down to ~10%.

-Based off of this, I was reading a Lyle McDonald article on lifting/keto, and he said it is very challenging for anyone to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time, except beginners. I am know I would qualify as a beginner, but at what point do I stop focusing on racking up more weight and focus more on losing fat when I lose the beginner simultaneous fat loss/muscle gain edge?

-Sidebar indicates that I shouldn't start a TKD yet, and for about 2 more months.

-Lyle McDonald indicates that it is hard, but possible to make gains on keto, but unless you start to increase cals you will have trouble. I have been following a few different comments on the sub that indicate either way.

I plan on continuing SL5x5 for a few weeks, until each of my lifts starts to stall, then switching to the SS 3x5 style. Also at that point slowing down the amount that I increase weights per session, because I won't be giving my body a sufficient number of cals to keep up (like only increasing squat amount 1x/week).

F/27/CW120, BF%24ish.  I don't really want more visible muscle, but don't care if it happens.  I'd been doing the CC training because I really enjoy bodyweight training (you are your own gym, being able to do more pushups than the guys in my office, etc).  My main strength goal is to be able to do 10 pullups in a row by the end of the year.  Right now I can do 3 sets of 2, or one set of 3 - improved from 0 in January.  However, I have been able to do 3 since April, and haven't seen gains in 5 weeks.  I was cutting weight in April, so this wasn't surprising, but I'd like to continue getting stronger.  How much more do I really need to eat?  I'm female, still around 23-25%BF (guessing), so I should be able to see strength gains without a ton of extra food, right?  I use MFP to track during the week, but it accounts for a very small number of calories burned per minute of strength training.  According to the ketogains calculator, Katch McCardle, maintenance is around 1600, Lyle says 1500, both pre-exercise.  I run every other day, and strength train 3 days a week (non-running days).  One day off or just yoga.  

Main Questions: 
1. How much more should I REALLY be eating on strength training days?  I am appetized or bored a lot of the time, so I have a hard time with the 'eat when hungry, stop when full' method.  I'm working on listening to my body on that, but in the mean-time - how much more does a little lady need to eat to get stronger?

2. Do you have a recommendation for a good bodyweight program?  The Convict Conditioning has sort of stalled, but I was reading I can do all 6 exercises 3 days a week, not just 2/day, 3 days a week.

3. At the house we have a bench press setup with an olypmic bar, but I don't know about doing anything other than bench presses with the setup.  Any advice?  I've read SL, but it seems to require more equipment than I have, and I am not willing to spend money on a gym membership.  

4. Macros!!!  Since I'm in maintenance, I wanted to see how I'd do with up to 30 net carbs (yay berries!).  I know I need to be at at least 1g protein/lb lbm, but do I need to be at 1.2?  Or only 1.2 on lifting days?  

Thanks for all your help!  I've been eating keto since April 1, and I love it!  I'm a lifer!

I used the keto calculator that was re-done and realize I need to up my calories and can up my carbs to around 50. I really don't care if I'm in ketosis--really just like the low carb for how it makes me feel.

I tried figuring out the SKD / TKD / CKD but I'm confused!

Here's my current routine: 

* Monday: Body pump (60 min weights, some cardio
* Tuesday: Body combat (60 min. heavy cardio) + CX Worx (30 min. core training)
* Wednesday: sometimes yoga, sometimes off. Might start trying to run
* Thursdays: Shock training (another 4 weeks, then I don't know) maybe a kettle bell class
* Fridays: Yoga and running
* Saturday: off
* Sunday: Body combat

So--I don't feel like I'm getting any stronger! I suck at push ups and don't feel my cardio is for shit.

I was at 1300 calories but am now trying to up it to 1700 and am actually finding it hard since I'm used to the keto diet and just not that hungry!

I don't want to burn out my muscles--is my routine okay and I just need to up my calories?

I'm not sure when I should be carbing up or protein-ing up. One person at the gym said carbs 2-3 hours before a workout and then protein after, it ""sounds"" like you guys say I need to carb afterwards.

I don't want to be a weightlifter (but I do lift)--more like Linda Hamilton in the 2nd Terminator or Jessica Biel in Stealth :) I need to be able to do the rope climb and monkey bars.

I have read a lot of the old posts here but I'm just not quite getting it--maybe this is for ""real"" lifters, rather than someone like me?

--------

Hey there fellow Ketoers! I've been on Keto since July of last year, and have had great success. Thanks to all who post and maintain the community here!

I have a question about TDEE calculators... I'm a server at 2 busy restaurants, and spend 45-55 hours per week on my feet, carrying plates and running laps around dining rooms. I'm having trouble finding/deciding on an activity level for TDEE calculators. I don't feel like I fit into the ""light"" or ""moderate"" category on most of them, but I also don't feel like I quite make the cut for the ""high/heavy"" activity levels. My experiments with eating bear this out, as well. Eating at the calories recommended by the lower levels doesn't fuel me enough for a busy double, and my weight loss stalls out when I eat at the higher calorie amounts.

Oh yeah, I even lift. Took a short break from Stronglifts, and am starting back up this week. I will also be incorporating some farmer's carry type exercises (heavy dumbells up and down the stairs in my apartment complex) as soon as I get the gear for it.

If my fellow Ketone producers have any advice for calculations that are more scientific than ""eat between those numbers,"" I would love to hear them. Thank you all!

**TL,DR: I am server who lifts weights, how do I calculate TDEE?**

(x-post /r/keto),LastMimsiE,3,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1dv0x9/unusually_sore_after_starting_at_the_gym_does/,"I've (24M currently 216lbs) been doing keto since the beginning of February and everything has been great so far. No flu, only 1 intentional cheat day, nearly 35lbs down. However, just last week I signed up at a gym with my roommate (not on keto) and been having a harder time than him. Granted I hadn't really gone to the gym since right after high school so this is practically my first time doing any weight training.

First day there was last Wednesday, we did about 15 minutes on the treadmill then hit just about every machine in there and did ~2 pretty low intensity sets just to get a feel for the place and our respective levels of out-of-shapeness. Thursday I was fine. Little bit sore but that was gone by Friday morning.

Went back Saturday and did about an hour on the treadmill, again fine afterwards.

Then Sunday was our first big day. He has done weight training before and put together a three day routine where we do different muscle groups each day (which upon reading the /r/fitness FAQ this morning might not be the best idea). So we hit basically all the back/leg machines. Ended up with 3 sets of 10 on 8 different machines over the course of an hour (which again might have been too fast, especially for my first time). I tried to keep it pretty light so I only had to push myself the last couple reps and only really exerted myself on this seated rowing machine. Afterwards I did an hour on the bike with again, no problem.

But the following morning I was really out of it. Legs/butt were pretty sore, which I expected. But the weird part was my elbows, specifically the lower part of my bicep. Anything more or less than a 90° angle was pretty rough. It waned over the course of the day and by bedtime I was only feeling it if fully extended. However, this morning it was back, hard. Legs/butt are more sore than yesterday and arms are worse as well. Felt a little better in the shower but two hours later any more than 100° actively hurts. While my roommate is completely fine.

For the past 3 weeks I've been using MFP I've averaged about 1100 net calories a day while being ""lightly active"" with macros around 60-65% fat 20-25% protein and 10% carbs (which upon reading the /r/ketogains faq is probably a bit off).

So my main question is how much of this has to do with Keto or how I've been eating specifically, and how much has to do with me just being a beginner? We're scheduled to go back today to do chest and abs but I doubt I'd be able to and definitely don't want to just end up hurting myself more.

I also don't have a spotter as I work out alone so I'm getting a little freaked to squat 330+ by myself.  

Do you think there would be any benefit to moving to a more hypertrophy based program with lighter weights and higher reps?  I know I won't be entering any comps anytime soon because my frequent travel schedule doesn't let me to set a consistent routine. 

Right now my lifts are as follows:

Bench:  265

Squat:  360

DL:  350

OHP (lagging as I never worked shoulders and had a shoulder injury):  150

so i'm low carbing for 1.5 years now, at least half of this time is SKD. I'm 5'7 and went from obese (220+ lbs) to overweight (185ish lbs) and now i'm pretty happy with myself/on keto mostly for increased energy and health benefits, but continuing weight loss isn't the last thing either. 

Now i just got [the bike](http://bikingindallas.com/wp-content/uploads/ue18full.JPG) and will have to use it as my main mean of transportation (mostly because my city streets are jammed all the time and buses' tickets are inadequately priced). I'm going to cycle at least 20km (12+ miles), at least 5 days per week. I used to cycle even more intensely 10-8 years ago and my endurance is still fairly good (cycled 10km, 3 of them uphill yesterday, didn't get DOMS). These are questions i have:

* does this count as moderate exercise? heavy exercise? (how do i enter this workout to a keto calculator?)

* should i do some bodyweight/dumbbel upper body exercises so i don't look like the opposite of a guy who skips leg day everyday? 

* may main sources of protein is chicken, pork and beef now. should i introduce some other kind of protein?

* i usually skip breakfast, eat some snack at around 3-4PM and have a big dinner. should i change my meal timing/somehow plan it around workouts?

* is there any other thing that's super important and i didn't think about?

I combined this with high calorie intake in a 15F/50C/35P ratio for roughly 4000kcal a day (being a student it was difficult to always hit that much, some days would be as low as 3300, while others were &gt;5000) but always the same ratio.  I'm a 23 year old male, 6'3"", and went from ~180 to 200lb, with ~11-14% BF (based on photos, difficult to tell).  I've made most of my noob strength gains but will be adjusting my workouts now that I am more knowledgeable in progressive overload training, as I may not have been taking full advantage of that method before.

Even at 200lbs I'm still very skinny (not sure where all the weight is) and would like to add further mass.  I'm intrigued by the keto diet and am considering switching from my 15F/50C/35P over to a TKD style.  I would be eating carbs before and after my workout, and aside from fibrous vegetables these would be my only carbs for the day.  

**My question is this;** would my body technically be in ketosis, even with daily ingestion of carbs (around workout)?  Since I'm used to consuming high volumes of carbs, instead of cutting them out I was thinking of modifying my current diet to have low-carb for each meal (high protein and fat), and then higher carb pre/post lifting.  That method would obviously not be keeping with the ketone diet. So I guess **my second question would be;** Does using a high protein/high fat/low carb diet while your body is not ""in ketosis"" actually have an *adverse* effect, since you will be ingesting a lot more fat but your body won't be looking for fat as the primary energy source?  Are any of these options even viable for further strength/mass gain goals for myself, considering how high my previous diet was in calories?",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,1367394382.0,,,True,t3_1dgw07,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1dgw07/considering_switching_to_tkd_from_a_bulking_diet/,

 I was making steady strength gains on all my lifts through about a week and a half ago. One of the days I decided to layer 30 minutes of cardio with 3 intervals of HIIT training. This was a bad idea as the next day I was absurdly sore. That lactic acid is burning away muscle sore that leaves you aching while doing everything. Since then I've been resting for the most part. A couple of days ago I played some ultimate in the park with some friends and felt like I pulled my left hamstring. The next morning I felt soreness over much of my legs and felt a muscle strain in my upper back. I've been resting but this morning, my right hamstring is now in pain for no reason. More generally, I've also been cramping up a lot recently.

I've done my calculator and the numbers just seem...out of this world.  Maybe it's because I've never really counted them (which I'm sure is why I'm at least partially in the situation I'm in) but I've come up with ....

65% Fat - 190g - 1710cal

30% Protein - 196g - 783cal

5% Carb - 30g - 120cal

Just quickly adding some things up in my head, it seems almost impossible to get nearly 200g of protein in a day. So my question is I guess, do my macros add up properly or am I as off base as I think I am?

My other question is, it's quoting my daily maintenance with exercise as 2,880.  I understand to lose weight I'd have to run a defecit, but as my numbers add up, it comes to 2,613.  That doesn't seem like enough to make a difference.  Is it? Or, if it's not, how do I get the cals to come down, I doubt I could go &lt; 30 carbs, cutting the fat % kinda defeats the purpose, and cutting the protein % would result in less growth.  Thoughts?  Sorry if these are noob questions, I've done plenty of the reading but I guess just actually kicking it off is a bit tougher than I thought.

Lastly, does the protein shake post workout get subtracted from the total leaving it still at 2,613?  Or can I count it, because that'd certainly make things a bit easier and cut out some eating.

How should I be eating?,googleyeye,4,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1bjq9u/doing_workouts_for_a_fire_department_cpat_how/,"I've been doing keto for the last month and a half, maybe two months now, and have dropped about 20lbs so far. Looking at the FAQ it appears that I may want to stick to the SKD given my time doing keto but my workouts qualify as high intensity so maybe I should do TDK.

Yesterday was my first mentoring session for the CPAT (Candidate Physical Ability Test). The workout is geared towards getting us candidates to pass the actual test. The workouts are two hours long and are comprised of the following:

~15min group warm up (jumping jacks, lunges, dive bombers, jump squats, etc)

30mins of running/spints

30mins of weights. They have stations set up with machines/free weights. You start at one station, choose a weight, and do reps for 45 seconds. There is a ten second rest and you go to the next station. The weight chosen is supposed to have you at near failure at the end of the time period. It finishes with pushups and front/side planks.

Going through the CPAT course. This part starts out with a 70lb weight vest and uses a stair mill. There is a 20 second warm up at 50 steps per minute and then the actual test which is 3 minutes at 60 steps per minute. After this 20lbs is removed and you go through the course, which isn't really important to explain fully. It involves carrying things, dragging things, lifting things, and hitting things.

15min group cool down/stretch. 


I ended up doing the weight vest part right after warm-up and made it to the 1min 45sec point. I could have kept going but I knew I had two other workouts so I didn't want to kill myself. 

During weights I had to stop for 2-3mins 2/3 of the way through because I felt like I was going to puke. I re-joined the group and completed the workout after that.

The run was, well, a run. I kept up with the group, which was moving at a good pace, until a little before the halfway point. At that point I started walking/jogging/running in intervals. The run was probably a mile and a half or so and my legs were already dead. When we finished we did sprints. Probably 150-200 ft. one way, 10sec rest, and back over and over again. I ran until failure. Then it happened. I puked. It was all water of course. 

I had my usual breakfast yesterday of 3 eggs scrambled in coconut oil with some old bay on them, 4 slices of bacon, and two cups of coffee with 1tbsp of heavy cream in each. I had a light late lunch, roughly three hours before the workout, which was string cheese, a serving of almonds, some deli ham, a serving of spinach, and a few pork rinds. 

After the workout I had a serving of peanuts in my car on the way home and a serving of pork rinds. I stopped at chipotle afterwards and got a bowl with double chicken/barbacoa, guacamole, sour cream, and lettuce. 

The vomiting was just from extreme physical exertion I assume. I drink plenty of water during the day, usually over a gallon, and my sodium intake looks good. Obviously my legs are sore today being a lot of the workout was leg centric and food won't fix that. 

I am wondering, what the proper way to eat before and after these workouts? Obviously I want to gain muscle from the workout and maintain endurance during the workout.


These sessions are at 6pm on weekdays and 8:30am on weekends. Should I wake up early and eat something before the weekend session or just eat after? 

Due to my work schedule I will be doing this workout once more this week, working out on my own next week, two times the week after that, again on my own etc. until I take my first official test in early May and for the month of May until early June if I can't pass it in May.

Weight gain at 5'10, 163lbs, ~17% BF (not sure, good lighting shows a outline of 4 pack), 2100 calories.",Chango99,4,1,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1bd3kp/should_i_drop_my_calories_weight_gain_at_510/,"So my TDEE is calculated to be at 2700 or so. About 5 weeks back I weighed in one morning around 161lbs, 3 weeks back 163lbs, and today 163.4lbs. This is with me consistently weighing in on Sunday mornings after a piss.

This indicates i'm gaining weight. Now, i'm one to tell myself maybe I'm just eating more than I actually think, weighing my food wrong or something, and simply add cardio or cut calories. However, it doesn't make sense given my TDEE and the amount of calories I shoot for, if I underestimate calories it shouldn't be THAT far off that it would put me at a net gain of calories.

Anyway, with regards to caloric intake, I'm thinking, just drop the calories right? Well, it's not suggested I go below 1900 calories or 142g of fat otherwise my body starts breaking down protein for fuel, as well as simply just not making sense why I would have to go that low. If I gain weight at 2100 cals, that means my TDEE is somewhere in 1800 range, and if I wanted to cut 1lb fat/week that'd have me at 1300 calories.

I recently added cardio LISS, still consuming 2100 calories for the most part.

For arguments sake, let's say it's just water weight or food still in me and I actually have lost body fat, it's still at a rather slow rate it seems. Would it be unadvisable going lower?

My end weight is likely lower than ideal/i would have liked, but my primary goal now is 6 packs clearly visible by the starting of June or earlier. This is to prove to my brother it's mostly about diet and you have to go about it in an educated manner, since he's way more active than me but wonders why he doesn't have an impressive physique, which I attribute to his lack of care on his diet.

For information, I've been on a cut/maintenance for a long while now. My last ""bulk"" was for 3 months about a year ago. My initial bulk on SS was a dreamer bulk from 160 to 200lbs in the span of 8 months. Unfortunately, I've lost more muscle than ideal. Used to squat 3plate for 3-5 reps but have trouble doing 275lbs for 5 now. Stresses of school and undereating did this to me.

Suggestions?

During the winter I decided to try a carb-based bulk and actually made some good gains (I suppose thats not surprising as I had never lifted before). 

I want to get back into keto as I've put on some weight (all on my stomach strangely). 

**My goal is to lose fat. I'd like to have abs, so probably around 12-10% BF.**

As far as stats go, I'm almost 22, 6'0"", about 190lbs right now (out of ketosis). I've only been able to measure my BF by looks, but I'd put it somewhere around 20%.

----

My plan:

~1970 calories 
25carb/130protein/150fat 

this assumes about 700 calories for workouts each week. I will only be doing strength training every other day, but will do morning walks more often. 

intermittent fasting: 20h fast, 4h feed. 

strength/cardio training (bodyweight with gymnastic rings) directly before my feeding time, and 10g protein (whey) before the workout, I'll probably spend about 30min training. 

Cardio in the morning, walking to start but once the weather gets nicer and I adjust to keto I'll gradually move into the C25k program. 

Finally while fasting I plan to just consume water and black coffee, the coffee should increase fat burning and decrease my appetite. 

----
In regards to the bodyweight training, I plan to do a bit of a hybrid approach between strength and cardio. For instance, I plan to work up to 100 pull-ups - but will also be trying to do muscle-ups. 

The reason I'm doing so much cardio is to increase my body's ability to use fat for fuel during high intensity exercise, and increased endurance is useful in daily-life while swimming, rock-climbing etc. 

I don't expect to gain muscle, though I do plan to see strength improvements because I am new and my brain should adjust neurally. 

I do expect my cardio abilities to increase, which will definitely help once I am ready to maintain and build muscle rather than drop weight.

The above is also another post I started stating the issues I've been having with keto lately. About to quit. But what I've been trying lately is eating &lt;1100 calories using myfitnesspal to say I need to lose 2lbs a week but adjusted percentages to Keto. Then what I'm doing after that is trying to get my protein to my daily limit first, but keep my fat about 20g less than what it says I should have. This generally ends up with me not eating 1100 calories but I would think that would try to prevent some of the muscle loss and possibly encourage more fat loss.

I haven't been able to find any real clear information about if this is an accurate thought or not. Most people just say follow the calculators to the dot and work out. I'm just trying to accelerate the body fat % loss.

Now I find myself sore for days on out, almost 3 days where I'm putting icy hot on and grunting when doing regular daily tasks.

One concern I have, though, is the lack of **soreness**. I remember being 16 and just feeling torn up the next day. A few times I woke up with my biceps so shot that they actually had contracted in my sleep, and I needed to gently extend each one with the other hand. 

I've spent the last 3 weeks doing what I considered moderately intense workouts, finding myself drained and exhausted at the end of the 2+ hours at the gym. 

I haven't been sore since about day 3, though, not really.  

If I'm looking for gains, should I have the usual 24-48 hour muscle soreness during the recovery of the muscle groups used? Am I undertraining? Am I magical? 

I began the ""get ripped workout"" (on the sidebar), and was pushing weight that I could barely get through on the sets of 6, and definitely feeling more of a burn than usual on the moderately-weighted sets of 10-12; but, about an hour after I'm home, I don't feel extraordinarily more tired, and would be (pleasantly) surprised if I felt sore tomorrow. Is this normal? Should I up some of the moderately-weighted reps' numbers? 

Just trying to figure this out. 

I also have a question about ""weighted crunches"". I tried this today with a 25 lb cookie, and found it impossible to do. The weight wasn't an issue, the bulkiness and cumbersome shape of the weight was to blame. I just couldn't manhandle it because it was pushing into my contracting abs, even when it was as far up to my chin as possible (which was also extraordinarily uncomfortable). I settled for a dumbbell, but ended up laying it on my collarbone after some experimentation, and still found it very uncomfortable and awkward. Does anyone have a great, or even decent, method of doing weighted crunches? 

Thanks!

I am grateful there are supportive communities out there for what we be doin'. Jeebus bless the interwebs!

Backstory:

Started keto in May of last year when I moved jobs at my work (due to a back injury) from one that was physically intensive to one that had basically no physical activity at all, saw I was going to gain weight quickly unless I changed something drastically. Went from 290s to 250s. I'm a pretty big dude, 6'6"", but I'd like to weigh about 225 in my perfect fantasy world.

In September I got put on forced medical leave because they could no longer accommodate my injury, so I had a lot of free time and nothing to do, so I started going to the gym with my bros and lifting cautiously at first, but after a month became pretty aggressive, except where I am limited because of my bulging disc (squat, deadlift, row). I do a preworkout (c4, jack3d, acg3, something like that) with creatine, then a postworkout protein with creatine and lately milk, which has seemed to stall my weight loss so I'm thinking about going to straight water again, even though milk is much more delicious.

All my lifts have consistently gone up (but my bench is low and will not seem to improve), muscle gains, strength gains (ALL KINDS  OF GAINS!) And then when I started supplementing creatine even more gains. I dropped off of keto during thanksgiving and christmas (I wonder why CARBS EVERYWHERE plus FAMILY STRESS) and a few times here and there but otherwise doing SKD. When not SKD, I did notice more energy at the gym, but also the normal grogginess and indigestion that comes when I get back on the loaf. This leads me to believe I need to do TKD or CKD for optimal gains.

So, now, questions for Ketogurus:

* I bought some dextrose at the supplement shoppe, wondering about dosage, (I average 257 right now) and when to dose. I've read a bit and heard &gt;15-30g carbs before your workout&gt; but also heard a bit a about post WO carbs, but that worries me as I seem to drop out of keto really easily, I might be a pre-diabetic sort of guy. What's the SOP for pre/postWO carbs?


* How do I increase my bench? I started at 135 and have gotten up to maybe 165 on a good day which seems pretty pathetic for the 6 days a week 90 minutes I've been putting in for months. My chest is definitely bigger but the strength is just not there. I've tried:
Lifting heavy (2-3 reps then fail
Lifting for reps (burning out 135)
Dumbbells
Machines
I've got pretty long arms, skinny wrists but I wear support gloves and have tried everything I can think of, train with a bro that maxes bench at 225 and I'm sick of him bitching at me like I'm not trying or something. I know I haven't been at this for super-long but looking at my other gains my bench is definitely the least improved. How do I get my bench up, ketogains?


A couple more questions that the bros argue about:

* Also this a common topic at the gym with seemingly no resolution but what is your guys' opinion on heavy leg days increasing test --&gt; more gains?


* Lifting to failure. What think ---&gt; ""Leave one in the tank""? or burn'em?

Alright guys I appreciate your help in advance.

Background: Today marks roughly 7 weeks that I have been doing a standard ketogenic diet. Aside from a minor mishap at Starbucks, I have yet to do a carb-up, refeed, or anything of the sort. 

About a week ago, I started lifting again after about 6 months off. I kept up on cardio, for some reason I just had no desire to lift. 

The first few days of lifting went gloriously. This with heavy cardio help me drop from 211 to 205 in less than 4 days. As soon as this happened, i skipped a day of lifting, only doing cardio, and havent stopped gaining (though slowly) since. I am back to 209 (up even from yesterday: 207) and I have no idea what is going. 

Questions: Is it possible that lifting has caused and increase in water retention?

Should I try a carb-up/ refeed? Should I switch to a TKD or even a CKD? Or should I continue at this rate and just see what happens. 

As I said, sorry if this a repeat of countless other posts.

I track all my food using fitday.  I eat between 2200-2400 calories a day and shoot for a 165/175/10 ish f/p/c breakdown and get pretty close everyday.

I eat very little fat during refeeds, and eat chicken/protein shakes to continue to get protein. I usually don't get into ketosis until Wednesday morning after my Fri night Sat Day carb up (at least thats when I show trace on the ketostix). 

Can you guys give me some ideas as to why I am not getting the results I am working hard for?  I feel like I look better in the mirror, but I think I should definitely be dropping weight.

Note that I had no idea how to calculate the kcals burned due to exercise.

My goals: Reduce body fat, put on some more muscle (eventually aiming for more of an athletic build).

I've decided to start up TKD, but I had a couple of questions about some things I've read here and there on this subreddit. 

My first question is, would it be better for me to eat at a calorie deficit even on workout days for now and then eventually up my calories to put on muscle, or should I go ahead and start doing that now? Or is it just a personal preference on my part?

My next question relates to doing a carb day as a metabolic reset. I've seen it mentioned on here and even more rarely on r/keto that doing a carb day occasionally can actually be beneficial. I saw someone mention http://carbnite.com/ns-thesolution.php#p2 this site a couple days ago, and it says to do it every 10 days.. but getting knocked out of ketosis every 10 days sounds like it could be pretty miserable. For those of you that have done or are currently doing this, would you recommend it, and if so how frequently should this be done?

Basically I'm a lineman, but as much as I love playing football I'm not happy with my body, so I want to lose weight but maintain my strength.
Keto seems to be going well so far. 

That said, I've definitely noticed that lifting and training is becoming harder; i get fatigued much faster, and I assume this is because of the lack of carbs in my current diet.

I started keto now because the season is almost over for us, however we have a game coming up against our cross town rivals on Saturday. It's a really big deal to everyone, we absolutely hate the bastards and its the biggest game of the year so I need to be at my absolute best performance wise. We also have a lot of extra training next week. I've read through the sidebar about TKD, could someone confirm that this is a sensible carb loading/glycogen replenishing regime?

Sunday: 2 cup oatmeal (60g carbs) an hour and a half before 4 hour general practice session 10am-2pm.

Monday: 500ml milk(24g) 45 minutes before midnight hill sprint session.

Tuesday: 1 cup of pasta with dinner (40g) before evening scrimmage session 8pm-10pm.

Wednesday: rest day, stretching etc, no carbs

Thursday: Begin full carb load for saturday. oatz with breakfast, 1/2cup of pasta with lunch, 2 cups of pasta with dinner. eat half, go to 1 hour blocking sled session 8-9pm, eat the rest after.

Friday: carb load day 2. oatz with breakfast, 1/2cup of pasta with lunch, 2 cups of pasta with dinner. evening conditioning &amp; walkthrough session, 7-8pm. Could I sneak in a pizza after this for some extra carbs/deliciousness?

Saturday: normal diet, a few bananas for before and during the game.
(beers afterwards, ooops :P)

how does that sound? I think I have my head around glycogen replenishment, but I'm a bit confused by the carb loading... the link in the sidebar seems to be recommending over 1kg of carbs for me over 24 hours, which seems like a ridiculous amount. I plan on going back to standard keto after this week.

Any help is appreciated, sorry for the wall of text.

It's actually some sort of crosspost from /r/Fitness, however I guess I will target the proper ""audience"" here.

I am overweight (120kg) and I don't want only to loose weight, I also want to recompose my body. I am in ketosis pretty shortly (few days) and I'm not sure if my supplement programme is good. I've used it during balanced diet and it worked pretty nicely, however now, after a rather long brake, I want to try out ketosis. I hope it's fine I am posting it here, even if I am not heading for bodybuilding itself, but rather already mentioned recomposition.

As a little of a background - I workout at the gym 4 times a week, now warming up myself after a significant break by doing a general body training. I want to try out [this](http://www.davedraper.com/entire-body-routine.html) routine with little modification. I know more or less my way around the gym and I know which exercises works for me and which one I enjoy. I workout by 1.5h of weightlifting followed by ~45min of cardio (treadmill, 5.5 km/h, 7% slope to keep pulse on more or less proper level).

Supplementation I use is pretty simple:

* BSN Thermonex (I've ordered also Hyper Shred): 3x3 capsules, 30 min before meal / workout.
* BCAA: just before and after workout.
* Whey: Low carb (2g/serving) after workout (when I end late, 9-10pm and don't want to eat anything), and sometimes before workout if I am not planning / don't have possibility for a pre workout meal.

Obviously it would be really nice if someone could access if this supplement plan is good with keto. It worked out on a balanced diet, however I want to make sure it's good on keto too.

I am also thinking about adding coconut oil as a source of fat to protein shakes. Either add this into shake (unfortunately so far I have solidified version) or eat 1 tbsp alongside. I am not also sure if one / two shakes per day would be enough.

Perhaps there is something else I can do? I've basically already ordered before mentioned supplements since I now they work for me. I am not sure if its use will be goo alongside keto diet, which I find so far very nice.

Thank you in advance for your help!

PS. Thermonex works pretty well. I've already noticed that it improved my concentration, relfex sharpness etc. while playing table football. ;-)",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,False,,,True,t3_16ckf2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/16ckf2/recomposition_with_keto/,

I have read a lot of the FAQs, and while they describe the process and why high intensity training needs some carbs, I'm just not catching the point in doing such a structured keto cycle is at all advantageous to a low carb normal diet. Some background on me to help you better understand the context of my questions. Male, 5’9” 165lb. I’m a highly active person. I lift weights 4 days a week, rock climb 1-2 times a week, ski  1-2 times a week, am just about to start training for an ultramarathon, and already have pretty low body fat. My questions may sound critical, but I’m really just hoping someone can give me the definitive info I need to make the plunge. I’m very in tune with my body and diet, am always looking for ways to better it, but I need to know I’m not jumping on some fad.


1.	From what I gather, it seems like this lifestyle is best for someone whose goal is weight loss or weight maintenance. Yes, I have seen the different cycling programs for bodybuilding, but why? Why even bother? From what I gather, it seems more like a glorified low-carb diet. Muscles love glucose for fuel, and as long as you are not putting more in than burning, there should be no fat gain. I fully agree with the keto philosophy that it is carbs and not fat that causes weight gain, which is what my diet reflects. Even before knowing what keto was, my breakfast was 3 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, and half an avocado. Lunches I try to stay around 20g of carbs, and dinners around 40. I aim for about 165g of protein a day. So as long as net carbs are around 0, what does keto have over a low carb diet?


2.	As someone who regularly does high intensity training, how can you maintain this diet? I feel like I’m missing a key component here. Could I possibly fuel myself through long distance running throughout the week via keto? More importantly, even if I could, would it be to my detriment? What is 


3.	Finally, and least importantly, but a question none the less, how does kissing someone in keto taste? Is the whole keto breath thing that noticeable? This just seems like a weird quirk of the program that might affect someone you’re with. I can’t imagine acetone tastes good…

Either Squats 165lbs 3x5
or Deadlift 245lbsx4, 225x5, 205x6

Alternating every week. I'm nursing a knee injury, so I can't do squats every workout like I used to.



**Diet:**
Leans gains style IF + keto (Stop eating at 8-9.00, start at 12.30)
Very meat heavy, very little vegetables unless it's kale/salad/avocado/onions/peppers

Lunch: Salad/Meat + veggie/lettuce wrapped burger

Dinner: Chicken wings/Eggs+Bacon+Burger/Steak/Sausages

snack: almonds/peanuts/85% dark chocolate/chocolate mousse (cocoa+avocado+coconut oil+heavy cream)

I drink Kombucha(fermented tea (5-6g of carbs/8oz)) sometimes after workouts and coconut water when I'm hungover (14g of carbs/8oz). Just stopped drinking diet soda regularly yesterday. 

Alcohol: Thursday (3-4 drinks), Friday (3-4 drinks),Saturday (1-2 drinks) whiskey on the rocks/or with diet coke, or tequila + soda, the occaisional dark beer.

Cheats: I get kim chi fries after drinking / indian food after working out sometimes.

**Questions**

1. Should I be cutting more calories? I estimate ~2000 cals on workout days and 1400-1700 on off days. I don't seem to be losing fast enough despite feeling completely drained at the end of workouts.

2. Should I consciously up my fat intake? My fat intake is not as high as the recommended 65%, I get far more protein % than I should. I tracked macros for a week, and I would routinely hit F/P/C: 55/40/5, and then chug heavy cream to compensate. How can I up my fat intake?

3. I sometimes carb up by eating some chocolate or fruit before a workout, and then halfway through the wokrout, I would feel completely drained. If I didn't carb up, I felt fine, but my early lifts wouldn't be as high.

4. I lost the most (and felt great)when I ate a lb of steak + heavy cream based sauce at 3pm, and nothing else. I have since left college and I work a 9-5. Can't do this anymore. Any suggestions? Anyone done something similar and found a better way to do keto ""warrior diet""-style?

5. Should I switch to a CKD/TKD if I want to cut more and retain muscle mass? I don't want to gain much more muscle (I'm reaching the limits of my work shirts) till I get a little bit of the fat off my upper arms and shoulders.

Thanks for reading! Any help is appreciated.

A few years ago I managed to lose a lot of weight, down to 185lbs from 290 lbs. This took nearly a year with a lot of nautilus machines and running. Since then I have lived a sedentary student life and managed to put on fat, 250 lbs.

About 2 months ago I started the Stonglifts 5x5 program. Discovered I hated the machines. Weight loss was not happening although I was gaining a lot of strength. I got up to 185lbs on my squats, 115lbs bench, 195lbs deadlift, 90lbs overhead press, 100lbs barbell rows.

About 2 weeks ago I started a SKD. The weight just flew right off, an I managed to not get much of the keto flu. Lost about 11lbs (mostly water I assume).

My trouble: Last workout was just terrible. Squats when fine, but I had no strength left for bench (I failed early and had to roll out for the first time ever). There was no strength left for barbell rows even on a reduced weight. I was spent.

I am wondering is this due to me not eating enough while in keto? Should CKD or CLB help me with this? Is one better than another for my level?

I appreciate that CKD, Protein powders, Creatine etc etc may all be beneficial in developing muscle and endurance *fast* but for financial reasons and longevity of approach, I've decided to forgo supplements and concentrate on nothing more than what I can buy at a grocery store and what I can do in my own home/locally.

As such, I'm interested in finding a pre and post-workout that's conducive with strict SKD (it's worked thus far) and carefully structured for maximum gains and explosive workouts.

Here's my intended approach and justification behind it. I'd be interested to hear *if* it's wrong, *why* it's wrong and what I could be doing better (in accordance with my criteria above) to maximise results from my efforts. 

***Pre***  
Butter or coconut oil. Straight. 25-30g. Why? Because [it's an MCT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-4OoCg1pciaHyJnMqfar67Y1ag55QaY8rm7vfhPr-4/edit?pli=1#heading=h.b4hqw266wy68) with high caloric yield in a dense dietary form which can start being utilised in &lt; 30 mins. It will give me plenty of readily accessible fuel to see me through a workout to exhaustion. No insulin will be produced as a result of consuming this food. 2-3 cups of strong black coffee to help with focus and physical activity, also helps pre-hydrate muscle tissue and prevent dehydration.
  
Meat and lots of green vegetables. No *added* fat, but I won't remove from any meat cuts. The idea being that the protein and carbs from veg (&lt;20g) will help spike my insulin and provide both the materials and hormonal incentive to regenerate and build muscle. As insulin also prompts for fat storage, no extra fat should be added to this post-workout meal/drink.

The goal isn't necessarily to use these timed 'meals' for weight loss but more as an aid for a good workout. It looks water tight to me and I tried it today, the butter and coffee beforehand certainly didn't impact my workout negatively - it went very well and I pushed out cleaner stronger reps during the 90 min workout.

How can I improve this? Why is(n't) it a bad idea?

Originally, I wanted to get below 20%, but I think I'll be close to that once I hit 175 and based on where I am now, I won't be happy with it.

I want to lift more, but it's not going to be a major focus in my life. In other words, it doesn't matter to me if I'm ripped or cut, or have a 6 pack or whatever. I just want to drop the fat and maintain the weight.

I put my info into the calculator from the sidebar, and I was recommended 2661 calories a day based on my activity. In order to put on muscle, I eat a surplus of 2861 cals a day, but I still eat ~1 g/lb of protein. I use MyFitnessPal, so my goals are:


36 grams of Carbs (It won't let me go lower than 5%, but I usually eat closer to 20)
238 grams of Fat
143 grams of protein


This is where I get confused. In order to maintain a surplus, and in order to eat around 1 g/lb of protein, I have to eat 238 grams of fat. The portion of the faq I quoted above says that if I eat too much fat, I'll put on body fat. Also, the faq recommends 35-40% protein, 40-50% fat, and the rest coming from carbs. I can't eat a surplus, 1 g/lb of protein, and fit the recommended macros at the same time!

Hello /r/ketogainers,
I'm on my Day10 of keto. I was not one of those who on the 1st week lost 10lbs (not even 3) **I started** doing **IF** every day a **23/1.** 

By next month, once I hopefully loose this month the first 10kg, I want to **go back** doing Cardio at the GYM. I hate being at home, and even if the gym is full of ""guidos"" and guys who just go there to try to fuck the hot girls in spandex pants, &amp; even if the music is completely crap, it's better than being in my house / psychopath center. 

Last year I did cardio and just ate proteins (yep) Got into ketosis this way &amp; lost 30kg. **I did 2 hours a day** (45m. class/90m. total), *every day 5 times a week*. One after the other (which I guess it's very good for weight loss) 1 day a week, I did *3 classes in a row* (3h/120m). 

I want to start next moth, doing 2 classes again. Once I get the skills back, I'll do 1 day with 3 classes. 


At the moment **I'm eating 1400 calories** + 24/1 Fast.


===================================
I would like to know if If once I start doing 2 classes per day, If I should somehow vary my ""keto style"" / calories / adding something extra / breaking the Fasting in other ways. 

If I eat 1400 calories. My pulsometer says I burn 800kcal-900-1000kcal per 2 classes/3 classes. Then I stay with 400-500 calories total.

Appreciate any tips, like, should I...



- Start taking protein shake? (don't think I need it for cardio)


- Take a grap of Almonds 30m before spinning?


- Take a chicken broth before training?


- Raise my calories?

I'm looking at hitting the gym hard and combining with Keto and looking for advice about where to start (been through the FAQs). For the next 3 months I can easily dedicate every day to this goal.

I need some advice from Aussies on what we can stack here pre-workout, for example I know Ephedra is a banned.

Since starting keto with my lifts (3x5, ~130kg squat) I have found my motivation and general lethargy before lifting is terrible [Note: its not all keto, the sensation of adding 2.5kg a visit is gone and thats a motivational problem too]. I lift Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday at 10pm for 1-2 hours then hit the shower and bed for 7.5 hours sleep. I'm 36% BF but I enjoy being strong more than losing weight, previously lost 30kg on Keto alone, before the relapse that is living solo. Eat 200g protein a day, take a multi, Vit B, St John's wort and sometimes Ibuprofen for DOMS

Basically I would like to take something at 9-9:30pm and explode out of lifts, last time I did deadlifts I was taking 10s breathers between reps...

Haven't looked into carb timings or anything, I think I will keep the diet portion as simple as possible until I'm at least 20% bodyfat.

I have read through the FAQs on /r/keto, /r/ketogains, many articles on bodybuilding.com forums and other sources of ketogenic diet information but one thing I am not clear on is working out during the induction phase of ketosis.

I am currently on my 6th day of my 65-33-2 keto diet and feeling good. I was planning on doing the CKD according to Lyle McDonalds guidelines and as such I went for a run on Sunday (2kms 12:30mins) worked out for just over an hour on Monday (Legs and Abs) and Tuesday (Chest and Back).

After reading more on the subject, I am worried about both entering ketosis and muscle retention.

At the moment, according to most sources, it takes 10-30 days to enter ketosis, which means I must stay with my low-carb dieting. But the CKD dictates that a 24-48 carb up period must occur following the depletion workout, which I am set to do tonight.

Should I stay out of the gym until ketosis is induced fully before doing a carb up, to retain the most muscle mass?",,False,self,t5_2v5mu,False,,,True,t3_1gaxmq,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1gaxmq/keto_induction_phase/,
1371108860.0,3,self.ketogains,1g97mh,[NOOB] Starting weight training with resistance bands,Walrusistan,5,2,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1g97mh/noob_starting_weight_training_with_resistance/,"So I'll start with the major points people will want to know

* I'm male, 27yrs old, 252lbs (114.3 kg), 6'3"" (1.9m)
* ~30% body fat based off mid-day hydrated impedance testing varying between 27-32
* I did read the FAQ and I searched for this topic, but found nothing relevant via Reddit search.
* I had a stall roughly 2 months into keto, but my body fat % (impedance) continued to decline as did body measurements with tape. I've been continuing to lose weight, and size, for the last month.
* I've been doing keto for just a few days short of 3 months now.

**Diet**

* Diet averages 1400-1700kcal per day with a 35/65/5 Protein/Fat/Carb macro. I don't track like I used to since I eat almost exactly the exact same thing every single day, and when I do eat it's measured to +/- 2 grams on my kitchen scale.

**Supplements**

* I take an array of supplements including a (likely overkill) multivitamin, b-complex, calcium, magnesium/potassium, zinc, and some nootropics.

I'll start by thanking all of you for existing. /r/keto is the reason I've lost 35lbs so far, and one of my family members has lost 15lbs as well. This isn't the first time I've done keto (I tried Atkins multiple times in the past) and the science-laden approach (as opposed to ""just don't eat pasta/bread/etc"") makes things a lot easier for my mind to grasp and work with so I stay on track. Not just thinking low carb, but keeping the carbs below 30g (I aim for 20 or less), and keeping the protein in a narrow range window.

So now that I feel like I have a handle on the diet itself without any qualms or cravings I've decided to start adding in exercise. I have a gym membership that's quite nice, but honestly I've been lazy about going and have been taking any excuse to not go. To be further honest, and somewhat self-critical, I think it's because I have body image issues and there's not a single gym around me that's not full of incredible looking people (yes, I've gym shopped). I realize that most of these people don't give a damn about me, and if anything are impressed that I'm trying, but even with me actively telling myself that...it's still difficult to muster the willpower to go in there. 

In short, it's hard for me to walk into a gym and use a tricep pulldown machine when some girl that could easily be recruited as a swimsuit model is working out beside me. I feel as if I don't belong there.

Accordingly I've purchased a resistance band set. The set I have ([viewable here](http://amzn.com/B003VPLWTO)) has the following bands:  Yellow Band (2-4 pounds), Blue Band (4-6 pounds), Green Band (10-12 pounds), Black Band (15-20 pounds), Red Band (25-30 pounds) and Orange Band (35-40 pounds). Unfortunately I wasn't aware of all the nuances in resistance bands and did not order one where you can combine the bands together; however, my current strength levels are so low that it's likely these bands will be worn out before I reach a strength level necessitating more resistance.

I did my first workout with these bands tonight. Not knowing how to proceed I just used the included guidebook to get started. I used the blue band (4-6 lbs) and did sets of 12, 10, 8, and 6 of each of the following exercises in the order they're presented in.

* Band squats (used 10-12lb Green band here)
* Band curls (used 10-12lb Green band here)
* Band lunges (could not complete a set of 12 on either leg with blue band)
* Lateral raise
* Tricep pulldown
* Squatted Row
* High chest press
* Kneeling crunches
* Chest body pull

I realize that there's likely already advice out there that describes a good resistance band exercise, and I tried reading though some of them, but many of them assumed you had gym equipment to secure the band to. I'm just working with the door mount. Further, and most critically, my many failed past attempts at fitness were because I was constantly reading some new tip from some muscle building site on how to do X or Y more efficiently - and I just ended up feeling frustrated.

To give an idea on that frustration: at one point I was working out 5 days a week doing weights MWF (cardio TR) for 2hrs each time with high-rep workouts on a medium carb, medium protein, low fat diet. I kept that routine up for 5 months straight without interruption. In that 5 months I never managed to increase the weight I could move on any of the workouts.

So this time I'm asking for advice.

M/21/5'9"" 168lb  Been low-carbing it since February and doing pretty awesome as far as body comp and weight-loss.  I started the 3X5 SS a month ago and have been loving it so far. 

 I never lifted in high school or did anything terribly athletic, so I started off with pretty low numbers in all the lifts, as expected.  But over the course of the month my bench press and overhead presses have been lagging behind.  I've always had strong legs and thighs and a wide chest, but never much strength in my arms(competitive gamer ftw).  So while my squats and deadlifts are progressing at a steady weight, my bench press is still kind of floating around where they started which is about 80 lbs.  

The days in between my compound lifting days I do targeted exercises for legs, arms and core.  Should I sacrifice some legwork to do a little more arm exercises, or wait it out?  My legs are pretty solid and I'm in no danger of chicken-legging, but I don't want orangutang arms either!
