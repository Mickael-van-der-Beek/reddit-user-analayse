I posted this to /r/Toasterovenclub but I'm x-posting it here. I have a microwave and a toaster oven. I suggested we get rid of both and get a really high-end toaster oven. Wife misunderstood me and thought we were getting a convection oven. I'm trying to figure these things out. Seems like they're still microwaves. I don't want to microwave my food for health reasons. It seems like they do both things at the same time.

Do you guys know of any convection microwaves that have truly separate functions that for sure do NOT use microwaves? Again, just some functionality that does not use microwaves is what I want. Thanks to all in advance.

I know there are a lot of joke submissions, but I figured you guys probably know your stuff.",,False,,t5_2uny9,False,,,True,t3_18rxgt,http://www.reddit.com/r/ToasterRights/comments/18rxgt/convection_microwave_with_truly_separate_functions/,
