1372195674.0,195,self.backpacking,1h2c8b,My 25 very useful tips and tricks for backcountry backpacking,DonTago,223,28,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1h2c8b/my_25_very_useful_tips_and_tricks_for_backcountry/,"I have done a lot of backcountry camping/hiking, backpacking across Europe, NOLS courses and recreational hiking, so I thought I would make a little list of useful tips and tricks [I hate the word *hacks*] that I thought many in this subreddit may find useful. Let me know what you think. Also, I would love to hear more from everyone else out there.

* **1:** On cold nights in your tent, fill your Nalgene/water-bottle will boiling water, wrap it with a tshirt and place it in the bottom of your sleeping bag. It will provide you much warmth thru the night. 

* **2:** If you run out of mosquito repellent, try rubbing yourself with (or hang off your clothes) leaves from [bay laurel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_laurel) or [elderberry bushes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambucus). They can act as a good natural repellent. 

* **3:** Always carry extra trash bags with you. Not only are they light and can be filled with trash, but you can use them as instant pack-covers or a makeshift poncho. Or in [emergency situations](http://www.backpacker.com/survival-lost-with-a-trash-bag/survival/14765) they can be used to help construct a rainwater-catchment device, an instant pup-tent or [if you have one in high-visibility colors like blaze-orange] they can make good ground-signals for rescue planes.

* **4:** Another Nalgene trick, always have several loops of duck-tape rolled around it. You can pull off pieces to repair gear, patch holes, use it as instant moleskin or just use it to pull cheat grass spines out of your socks.

* **5:** Telescoping hiking poles, you may think you don't need them and that they are just for old people and beginners, but they can be invaluable for crossing rocky outcrops, river-fording, fighting off nuisance animals and most importantly reduce the impact on your legs, knees, ankles, and feet.

* **6:** Remember when you pack away your food at night into a bear-bag, bear-bucket or campsite locker, put in everything that may emit a scent; that includes toothpaste, moisturizers, insect sprays, etc. Animals are curious and may investigate any foreign smell, even if it is not food.

* **7:** Those thick plastic packages with zippers that are used as packaging for bed sheet-sets you get at the home-dept at box-stores make *great* make-shift dry-bag containers for packing toiletries or nick-knacks in the top of backpack. Because really, dry bags are expensive as hell.

* **8:** When packing your pack, place the heaviest items as close to your spine as possible, do *NOT* pack them all at the bottom of the pack. The closer to the spine you pack gives you more [stability](http://www.deuter.com/en_US/tipps-and-tricks-421.php?title=Packing%20a%20backpack), while placing heavy items at the bottom can throw off your center of gravity and could affect your ability to balance properly.

* **9:** Not drinking tons of water before going to bed and peeing before bed help keeps you warmer thru the night. Your body will waste great amounts of energy to first bring all that water up to body temperature and then keep it at that temperature all night long.

* **10:** Attach alligator or binder clips to the top of your pack, and you'll always have an easy way to hang clothing to dry while you hike.

* **11:** One way you can lighten your load is to carry high-calorie foods. Suppose you need 12,000 calories for a weekend trip. This could weigh from fifteen pounds down to four pounds, depending on the foods you select. Dark chocolate, dried apricots, nuts and cheese will give you thrice as many calories as bread, fresh vegetables or chips.

* **12:**  Freeze Dried Meals are very expensive, the manufacturers take advantage of people's inexperience when it comes to backpacking food.  You can buy two whole days worth of food for the cost of a single freeze dried dinner. 

* **13:** Collect the lint from your dryer in a small plastic bag. It makes for a great kindling when attempting to start a fire. It is lightweight and catches easily.

* **14:** Do not spend a ton of money on a tent footprint, they can be [expensive](http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3401971). Instead, get your hands on a piece of TyVek. It is a very lightweight waterproof protective wrap used for homes. You can find some usually at construction sites or Lowes/Home Depot.

* **15:** Instead of carrying an expensive custom camp-pillow, stuffing your clothes in one of your larger stuff sacs makes a dandy pillow. This may even warm your clothes for the morning robement.

* **16:** If you are using a pump filter for water, make sure you pump out the excess when you are done. Otherwise you will be carrying around a lot of dead-weight. (*Note*: I personally prefer water tablets or AquaMira for water purifying)

* **17:** Paint all your cooking pots with flat-black stove paint. A blackened pot will absorb heat faster than a shiny surfaced one. This will reduce the amount of fuel you use per meal.

* **18:** Do not attempt major hiking trips with new boots. If blisters or sore areas develop on your feet b/c of new boots, it can effectively ruin a trip.  Break in new boots slowly with short, quick hikes. I would say about 50-100 miles on boots is 'broken in'.

* **19:** If a lot of rain is expected, do not be shy to bring a small light umbrella. No amount of waterproof clothing will keep you completely dry in an extreme downpour, so it may not be a bad idea to keep a small one on-hand, if you have room.

* **20:** Bungee cords have a million uses, it is a good idea to have one or two. Also, learn some [common knots](http://www.backpacker.com/skills-sept-2010-fit-to-be-tied-four-common-knots/articles/14441), they can be invaluable. 

* **21:** There is a lot of snobbery when it comes to the age-old sleeping bag debate: synthetic vs. down. But at the end of the day, if you wanna save money, buy synthetic. If you wanna save on weight, buy down.

* **22:** I have personally found that the egg-carton foam [Thermarest](http://www.rei.com/product/829826/therm-a-rest-z-lite-sol-sleeping-pad) sleeping pads are the best. You don't have to fuss with inflating them or worry about getting holes in them. Also, you can cut sections out to your appropriate size to save on weight.

* **23:** Backpacks come with huge amounts of extra long straps and even straps and buckles you don't need. Figure out what is useful and fits your needs, then cut the rest off. It cuts down on weight and things dangling all around you while you hike.

* **24:** Carry a whistle with you. It is good for scaring bears and essential when you get lost from a partner or in the wilderness. Also, if you are hiking in an area with heavy bear activity, put bells on your pack, it helps alert them to your presence. The last thing you wanna do is startle a bear with her cubs.

* **25:** Don't solely rely on technology. Be prepared and educated on how to find your way without the help of a cell-phone or GPS, using just your map and compass. There is no amount of technology that can replace competent orienteering skills. Also, learning to tell direction by the stars is a useful skill to have when disoriented.

How would accomplish it? How would you try to make money, stay, what would you want to experience (destinations, food etc?) :)

The question stems from an idea my husband and I have been tossing around. I'm a dog trainer my husband is an engineer. Lately, although we have a comfortable life, own our house get our bills paid etc. Neither of us feel as if we are actually living our lives. In 7 years we have never been on a vacation, have never traveled, and never experienced anything outside of day to day life with eachother (work, home, clean, take care of the child etc.)

We have been contemplating selling our home buying a vehicle that will pull a camper and taking off to travel around the united states with our, toddler, 2 German Shepherds (1 is a medical alert dog, 1 is in training to continue her job (SD, SDIT) a miniature dachshund, and a cat (who a family member will watch for us on our expense). 

We would sell everything, and are considering just forking out the money for better medical insurance...

A call for your help:

I'm hoping to create something for the reddit community because I was looking for just such a thing, and I realized it did not quite exist.  I think it could overlap with many of the interests described here in r/backpacking, but still offer something unique.

I'd like to create a home to share those stories and resources in one place. I envision it as a destination for anyone who thinks ""I've got $200, what's the coolest trip I can go on, and how can I squeeze every penny.""

I am looking for people who would like to join me in building this subreddit by moderating or submitting content. Or, if you have something else to offer -- an idea, a logo -- we'd love that too!

Please join us.

America, Thailand, or US?",ElusiveReverie,60,15,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/18izfv/giving_it_all_up_to_backpack_the_world_where/,"Hello all! I've decided to pack my bags, walk out the door, and leave my home behind.

I'm a man in my late-20s, live in California, and would like to backpack around the world - spending sparsely and having no agenda or date of return. I've car-traveled a lot of the US, and have been to Mexico once for a vacation. I hike and backpack locally frequently.

I'm trying to figure out if I should explore my home country or branch out. I've got a few thousand USD saved, and plan to work odd-jobs if necessary (my skillset also lends itself to telecommuting if things get really bad). WWOOF and Helpx.net are some tools I'm sure I'll use.

Thailand has the advantage of being cheap from what I understand. I can stretch a dollar a long way. I can also travel to Australia or up through Asia into Europe by mostly-foot. Though I'd have to start with a flight which cuts out a non-trivial amount of my savings. (~$600) Not to mention having to check baggage which I'm not too fond of.

South America (Brazil &amp; Chile specifically) has the advantage of being reachable by foot alone and I know enough Spanish to get by. I'm a little hesitant about crossing the US-Mexico border, though.

Of course, staying in the US has the advantage of being in my comfort zone which is why I'm least interested in this option. The US has a lot to see, though, and the potential to provide a whole new outlook from the eyes of a backpacker around places I've already been.

What do you guys suggest? Any relevant advice?",,False,self,t5_2qpcz,1360865731.0,,,True,t3_18izfv,http://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/18izfv/giving_it_all_up_to_backpack_the_world_where/,

I flew to Anchorage, hitched south to Hope on the Kenai Peninsula, hiked the Resurrection Pass, stayed in Cooper Landing, hitched to Seward and then to Homer. I was there for two weeks, and it was absolutely amazing, even though my backpack was heavier than I thought it would. I ended up sleeping in my tent most of the time, but fortunately there were no nightly visits from bears, moose or other animals. ;) Hitching was surprisingly easy and I had amazing weather.

Only bummer, my passport got stolen while I stayed at a hostel in Homer. But all in all this was just awesome and I'm already thinking of going back in February, this time heading farther north.

So I've just booked my ticket to Thailand for a 5 week trip. I'm so excited for this fantastic opportunity to immerse myself in a foreign culture. I am travelling by myself - I'm recently separated, and I thought this trip would be a great way to relax and to rediscover myself as an individual. I'm a 31 year old male going on 20!

I don't have a lot of travelling experience - my only other major trip was with the ex-wife through parts of Eurpoe, and we could only stay at hotels that were 3+stars. I don't have a lot of complaints about this, except for the fact that it was really expensive. And although I am looking forward to some 'me' time, I'd like to meet other people in my travels.

My question is this - how do I do this trip? On my trip to Europe, I  brought suitcases and stayed in hotels. Should I pack suitcases and stay in hotels in Thailand? Should I go buy a big old backpack? I'm not opposed to spending $1500 on accomodations over the course of the month, but I also want to be able to meet people, and I don't know if hotels will facilitate this. 

I don't know a lot about hostels - would they be a good place to meet others? How does one go about finding them? Do I need to bring anything, like bedding? How do I make sure my stuff does not get stolen? 

I want to come back from this trip with stories about all the awesome things I did, and the great people I've met. I'm an inexperienced but excited traveller looking for advice from the vetrans - how do I make this the trip of a lifetime?

Thanks in advance!

I was thinking it would be mostly over a weekend or something so probably two to three nights. I've been looking around and trying to figure out what to get but I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. I don't really want to spend too much money to start because I'm not sure that I'll like it. I love camping but since I've never backpacked, I'm not 100% sure what to expect. 

Here's a little info about me and what I want to do:

21 M 5'9"" ~150 lbs

* I live in West Michigan but plan to do most of my camping around [here](https://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=manistee+national+forest&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=manistee+national+forest&amp;hnear=manistee+national+forest&amp;cid=0,0,2059313478672719405&amp;ei=npm8UY-EI-m3yQGLz4GgDg&amp;ved=0CKoBEPwSMAc) or more north.
* I will mostly be going in the summer, maybe some early fall and later spring. 
* Plan on camping near rivers and lakes.
* Possibly going by myself or with 1-2 others.
* Mostly weekend stuff so 1-3 nights

I currently have a tent, but it's probably way to big and way to heavy to carry far. I also have a backpack that my ex's dad gave me, but it's super old and wouldn't hold much (it's basically a bag attached to a metal frame with some straps for a sleeping bag). I will probably start off with short hiking distances, but may want to eventually build up to longer hikes.

Basically, I'm not sure of where to start, how to get into it, what I need, etc... Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I can answer any other questions you may have. 

Thanks guys.




EDIT: [Here](http://imgur.com/a/fYbPp) is what I have. 

The red tent is one I got for like 30 bucks a few years ago. 

The green one is an old eureka my dad used to use on motorcycle trips.

I was originally going to go to South America but I've decided there is a lot to see on the other side of the world and it's cheaper for me to get to.

I want to start off WWOOfing/ HelpEx in Portugal for a month, that way I can save money and become accustomed to life away from home, then move on to somewhere else.

I was going to check Morocco out after Portugal but I've just read a load of horror stories, so now I've been scared off. Is this right?

So in short, who has gone away on a whim on a similar kind of trip and can share some advice? Right now I can say I'm up for Couch Surfing and hitch hiking etc, but when it comes to it I tend to worry myself out of things so some reassurance from experienced people would be nice.

I'm graduating high school this year and will be doing ROTC in college. After I graduate, I'll receive orders and will be involved with Infantry and will probably be either training or deploying for around 6-10 years. I'll also be unable to do it in the summers during college either, for various reasons.

My point is, once I start college, I'll have a solid 10-15 years of being unable to really backpack around Europe and will be roughly 30. This summer is my chance at doing this while I'm still ""young"". I was told I couldn't because it's dangerous and they even asked me if I had seen ""Hostel"", insisting that was an actual and serious danger for backpackers.

The biggest hurdle has been my student loans; since my Dad is a cosigner, I can't risk any damage to his credit so I had to ensure that I could maintain an income to pay my loans. Other than that, I plan to live on the cheap (not by mooching, but rather a deprivation of luxuries and comforts) and will be walking or hitchhiking wherever I go. 

Just recently, I was finally able to seal a remote work arrangement with my current job. Income established, departure date ~4 weeks.

I have my pack already. It's a 65L (extendable to 75) Deuter pack, and a waterproof cover. 

* I've pretty much decided on a tent, but haven't purchased so I'm open to suggestions. Currently considering the Eureka Spitfire.

* I'm torn on sleeping bags. I know down is the warmest and the most compact and lightweight (all ideal) but I also know that moisture and use can drastically reduce the loft and the overall performance. The bulk and weight of synthetics, however, makes me not happy to go with them either. I'm currently considering either the 15 or 0 degree DriDown bags from Sierra Designs. Any informed opinions?

* Clothing is probably my least informed area. I know cotton is ill-advised, but that's about it. I'm currently in NJ, I'll be heading south/southwest for the Winter to stay in warmer climates where I can. I plan to hitchhike and walk, but want to be prepared to spend the majority of my time walking. Can anyone over advice into the types of clothes that would be best; durability, comfort, least chafing, waterproof/resistance, etc?

* I plan to be in and out of, and nearby, towns &amp; cities for the first several months so food and water won't be too much of an issue. However, I have not yet purchased any equipment to store and carry water. While I'll have access to these resources, I don't want to be in and out of towns, stores and etc all the time so I do plan to carry a few days supplies at a time. Does anyone have recommendations for containers to carry water?

* Any other gear, handy little tools that you have found invaluable? I'd love to hear about those as well.

There are a lot of motivations and inspirations behind this trip: some of it is just wanting to travel, to sate the wanderbug that has been gnawing at me for most of my life; some of it is developmental, as I feel there is a lot to be learned about the world and myself from such an undertaking; and some of it is a personal mission of goodwill. 

I think we are, or at least could be, on the cusp of great changes in humanity and I think that if they arise they will come as movements of the people, not changes led or enforced by religions or governments and I think a lot of it depends on individuals making the effort to engage each other differently and more positively. Along my journey I want to talk to people about the future, about how we can make it better - not how we can make government make it better, or how we can get this group or that religion to make improvements - but how WE can make it better. And I want to make life, even if just for that moment or day or whatever, better for those I come in contact with through words, actions, etc.

**EDIT** Since this is a self post and there is no karma/internet points to be gained, I'm a bit bummed by the downvotes. My post got accidentally caught in the spam filter for a couple days which hurt the visibility already, and downvotes make it even tougher.

So come June I will be going to Scotland for a friends wedding, and will be doing some backpacking across Europe after the wedding. I plan on being in Europe until mid-late August. I am 23 year old single male. I enjoy the outdoors and am a lot more interested in seeing nature, relaxing and soaking it all in, rather than pacing through crowds to see Cathedrals and Churches. I also like to party and have a good time. I am not someone who needs to plan out every day of my trip. I like to live in the moment and meet new people and see where that takes me, but would like to have a rough idea of the route I will take before I make the trip overseas. I just recently got out of a long term relationship and am looking to grow as a person again (as cheesy as that sounds!)

So I guess I have a couple of questions...

1) From the info I have given, where do you think I should spend some of my time traveling? The places I think I would really like to visit are Germany, Switzerland, Croatia, Amersterdam. How much time should I commit to a city or country?

2) How much money do you think I should save for an approximate 2 month trip? Keep in mind I will be doing hostels and will try to live on a budget. I know Germany and Switzerland are expensive countries but those are the top 2 places I want to visit there.

Am I in the wrong here?,losangelesgeek88,32,5,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/19fjkg/yosemite_rangers_getting_really_strict_or_just_a/,"In August 2012, I was backpacking in Yosemite ntl park and was confronted by an older ranger who gave me a harsh lecture about not tying up food or trash items in trees to keep them from bears. 

I was taught by my father to do this, and nowadays with bear containers I typically haven't had to. Unfortunately my friend and I only brought one bear container and had too much to fit into it (bad planning, i know), so we took a bag and struck it up in a very high, un-climbable tree (no branches at all, nothing to grip). For the first two nights our solution worked perfectly and we had no worries about bears getting it on our last and final two nights.

Then during the evening, this ranger game and sternly lectured us, and said he'd give us a warning. He was writing down a bunch of stuff in what looked like a small notedpad. 

He said we could bring the trash to the ranger camp which was about a mile away. We did that, then went back and left 2 days later.

Didn't think much of it, other than the fact he was kind of a jerk to us. He literally said, multiple times: 'do you guys want to kill bears!?'

A few weeks later, I got a $100 citation mailed to me and basically had the option of driving 6 hours back to Yosemite to represent myself in court, or pay the fine. Because of work constraints and a refusal to drive that far, I ended up paying it. But I've been very frustrated since with the way it was handled.

What do you guys think? I understand it's terrible for bears to get access to our trash and food, but I've been doing it my whole life and I've actually never had a mishap with a bear being able to get to my stuff. I also never leave anything behind, besides my poop, and even that I take extreme care to choose the right place to do the deed.",,False,self,t5_2qpcz,False,,,True,t3_19fjkg,http://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/19fjkg/yosemite_rangers_getting_really_strict_or_just_a/,

1366216473.0,26,self.backpacking,1cjhy7,"My experience backpacking through 12 European countries, 35 cities over 64 days. (Prep, during and after)",itsnevermillertime,32,6,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1cjhy7/my_experience_backpacking_through_12_european/,"So I am doing this because I answered one of the many requests for advice on backpacking through Europe on this sub and I wish I had something like this when I was preparing for my trip. I am speaking from experience so this is for those of you looking to travel late Spring to Summer. 

I began preparing for my trip in 2010 after I graduated college and decided I didn't want to get a real job yet. I worked at Starbucks, spent hardly any money and saved for about 6 months. This trip, all inclusive cost me about $5500. This is what that money got me:

1. **Roundtrip Flight** LAX&lt;--&gt;Heathrow $820 STAtravel.com (you pay a $30 membership fee and you need a university ID, but they don't check if you are still a student.) 

2. **Eurail Global Pass** for 2 months of consecutive travel days. If you plan to cross the English Channel, those tickets are extra (about 120 pounds roundtrip, depending on what day and time you cross. Weekdays at 6am are usually the cheapest). I paid $1000, now it's about $1100 http://www.eurail.com/eurail-passes/global-pass

3. **50L Travel Pack** from REI. $129.99 (This is the link to the newer version: http://www.rei.com/product/809156/rei-grand-tour-85-travel-pack-mens) There are 3 compartments. The bottom compartment was used for dirty clothes. Also included is a detachable day pack. 

4. **NorthFace Waterproof Jacket.** Something durable and waterproof for those travel days it might be raining. $80

5. **Hostels.** Get the Hostel Hero and Hostel World apps. If you plan on kind of planning this trip on the fly, this will be a lifesaver as some hostels don't have computers, but 90% have wifi. What I did was book hostels in the biggest cities I knew I was going to visit (london, paris, brussels, berlin, zurich, rome, florence, barcelona) This kept me on track if I decided I wanted to stay in one country/city for longer than I anticipated. Just book the big cities, then use the app to book the others when you think you know when you want to arrive and leave. You will stay in cool hostels and you will stay in borderline sketchy hostels. Take it in stride and pay attention and read the ratings from the apps I listed. They give great insight. Take a Sleep Sheet http://www.rei.com/product/627255/cocoon-cotton-bag-linertravel-sheet
This will allow you to not have to pay to rent sheet from some hostels that don't provide them. They usually charge 3-5 Euros. 

6. **Food.** Most hostels offer continental breakfasts. LOAD UP AND EAT THIS ""FREE"" MEAL. This will save you so much money. This way you won't be hungry til about 3 or 4 and you can manage most days on 2 full meals a day (leaves more money for alcohol ;)) My meals mostly consisted of baguettes, cheese and deli meat. Just FYI there is a law in France that states baguettes cannot cost more than 1 Euro (they cost about the same in other countries). When you are hungry at dinner time and see that you are in a city that will destroy your food budget, find a local grocery store (Co-Op, Lidl, Billa are the most common.) and cook in the hostel. Some hostels have kitchens to use at your disposal. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_supermarket_chains

7. **Alcohol.** Wine is UNBELIEVABLY CHEAP in Europe. In Paris I bought a 5 year old Bordeaux for 6 Euros at a local convenience store. In Italy it's embarrassingly cheap...obviously. Be weary of hostel-run pub crawls. Usually they get a cut of the initial charge and the drinks suck. It's best to ask about bars in the area and explore with your hostel-mates. 

8. **Best events of my trip.** Renting a Vespa in Siena, Italy and riding around the Chianti region in Tuscany and visiting small towns and wine tasting. Attending the running of the bulls festival in Pamplona, Spain.

9. **Safety.** You will get a certain vibe from every hostel as soon as you walk in. I bought zipper locks for my backpack [Zipper Locks](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/9725907599102514207?hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=small%20locks%20for%20backpacks&amp;oq=small+locks+for+backpacks&amp;gs_l=serp.3...13294.13671.2.13797.5.5.0.0.0.2.122.396.3j2.5.0...0.0...1c.1.7.psy-ab.QO507D6FGYI&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.44158598,d.aWc&amp;biw=1398&amp;bih=719&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jUpKUbm1J-OEygHQ6YHYBQ&amp;ved=0CG4Q8gIwAg)  

because when you go out, you won't be taking your backpack. Some hostels provide lockers so make sure you bring a lock. I also brought a bike lock 
(something conspicuous and not huge [Bike Lock](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/403814320875697102?q=bike%20locks&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.44158598,d.aWc&amp;biw=1398&amp;bih=719&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tklKUeCkAcb4yAH314H4AQ&amp;ved=0CJkBEPMCMAQ) 
and locked my backpack to my bed or bunk. Have a fanny pack (dont call it that when you're over there, you'll find out why lol) and use it to store important things and carry it with you in cities where the hostel has an iffy vibe. 

**Documents.** I made copies of: reservations for hostels that I made before the trip, passport, bank card (check with your bank and see how much they charge to withdraw money in each country. There are some Euro banks that have partnerships with US banks so they don't charge to withdraw. If they don't, it's usually $5 per withdraw, no matter the amount. Chase does not charge international fees but also you want to be careful in leaving cc information with sketchy hostels or businesses. So use your best judgement. Best bet is to withdraw money for 3 or 4 days or if longer, about half of your stay per respective currency.) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_ATM_Alliance

**Things to take:** Locks- for lockers if provided by hostel, for zippers on your travel pack, bike lock to lock backpack to bed/bunk. Swiss Army Knife. 2-3 Laundry Detergent packets (you can buy more there once you get the hang of things). Outlet Converter. iPod Touch with wifi capabilities. I traveled for 2 months so I took the following in terms of clothing: 3 pairs of jeans, 2 pairs of shorts, 4 t shirts, 2 collared shirts, 6 pairs of socks, sandals, walking shoes, casual shoes, 8 pairs of underwear. Now you may be thinking that's a lot. BUY SPACE SAVER BAGS!!! They were my lifesaver. A Large and Medium size should do just fine. Passport (obviously)

**Souvenirs:** I took a freezer size bag and told myself I had to fit everything in that bag. I brought back bar coasters, city maps, bus maps, museum pamphlets, basically anything that was made of paper. Those are the real souvenirs.

**General Advice:** I hope you are taking some kind of wifi device. I would definitely invest in a used ipod touch if you dont have one. I took my iphone and just used it for wifi. The Hostel Hero and Hostel World apps are AMAZING. Be sure and visit small towns that you may not have thought about. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put Leuven, Belgium on your itinerary and stay at The Leuven City Hostel. It's a 30min train ride from Brussels. This hostel is the nicest hostel I stayed at. Private bathrooms and a kitchen. Don't take the Stella Artois tour. There you will find the ""longest"" bar in Europe and party hard because about 70% of the town's population are college students. 

Bring along your favorite songs that make you feel inspired. I put together a Europe playlist on my iPhone that consisted of folky acoustic, dance, international, and just other thought-provoking music. Also a great thing to share with people you meet. 

When in Florence stay at http://www.plushostels.com/pluscampingmichelangelo. You stay in a tent with actual beds looking down on the City of Florence and there is a cheap convenience store on the premises as well as a restaurant that serves the best pizza for 5 Euros. Buy a bus ticket at the train station at what looks like a souvenir shop window. You can take the number 12 or 13 bus (they both get you there) and it's the stop after Piazza Michelangelo (about 20 min bus ride). When you are able, stay at a PLUS Hostel, they are nice and offer a great party atmosphere. The Plus in Berlin is realllllly nice as well. 

You are going to meet so many amazing people on trains, hostels and just by walking around. TAKE A JOURNAL AND WRITE IN IT EVERYDAY. Even if you just write bullet points. I asked the people I had connections with that I wanted to remember to write something down in my journal. Life advice, trip advice, a funny quote, etc. I still go through it and remember the awesome time I had. Your time over there is going to go by so fast, you want a way to look back. I took my Canon 7D and came back with 128GB worth of photos and video footage. I made a highlight video of every city my friend and I visited, you can check it out here https://vimeo.com/28495918

The other travellers gave me a general idea but I was concerned they were trying to add in too much without really knowing the transit times so I made a general outline spreadsheet of travel times between cities to inform them that we had to cut 2 out of 3: Hanoi, Chiang Mai and/or Phuket or risk being on a train non-stop. We all agreed 2 - 3 nights in each city was what we wanted. They liked my spreadsheet so... I kept going. Even I am now overwhelmed by this thing. I do think we're going to get more out of the trip than if we had ""winged it"" as was the original plan. I can't help it... I'm an overplanner.

They say they love it and are thankful but I have a feeling they're also a little bit overwhelmed by it all. I only know the one girl well and she knows how I am as well as that I'm autistic (aspergers). I've tried throughout the planning to be very adamant that this is all based on their input and we do not have to stick to it. They wanted to pre-book the train to Phuket and some flights so, we did. I take that as a good sign that they're on board.

Notes: 

 * Everyone else is in Korea so that's why I did the KRW conversion. I changed their names to single initials to protect our identities. 

 * I used Seat61.com for all the transit times. That site is brilliant.

I am taking over from what officialusername did: I estimate $3 total per patch.

PM if you want one. 

EDIT: On an order of 100, we can get at about $3 per patch, including taxes and SH. I have to pay taxes on the order, and SH does increase cost.

This is a personal project of all involved, we are printing these patches for ourselves, and we are not going to make any money out of it.

Also, I think we can ship these overseas, using USPS on their cheapest setting.

I've been backpacking now since july 2012. (I've got some posts in my history from before then/some posts since about backpacking) and i have a dilemma.

I've been offered a sponsorship in Australia in my current company, if i take it, i can either stay on my current pay (which is alright) or get a pay rise linked to KPI's for a year... which sounds like a terrible idea.

Basically, i came backpacking to get away from working in an office, get away from stress. I was diagnosed with depression back in Jan 2012 which was the final straw in making me go backpacking. My job currently is IT support/security/programming/db/networks, basically i do a lot of IT work within this company (its a building management company)


My job out here is slowly turning into 10 hour days, i'm actually waiting on a phone call to start work at some point this weekend. I've got a week to decide and i really dont think its worth it.

I came out here to travel, i'm in Melb at the moment and heading over to NZ once i finish my year in Australia. If i take the sponsorship i doubt ill go to nz or asia, and just fly home

So, i've got an interesting opportunity here, but i dont know what to do. I can take the sponsorship for a few years, stress myself out, and make decent money, or i can go travel some more.


.....am i stupid for wanting to carry on travelling? I'm 26, and its starting to feel like i'm getting too old to still be doing this, like there should be a law saying once you hit your late 20's its time to shut the fuck up and get a proper job. I want to scream at my friends who are stuck in shitty 9-5 jobs back home and tell them to wake up, save some money, and get on a plane.


Obviously i'm not asking reddit to make this decision for me, but a question to everyone who got a sponsorship and decided to take it instead of continuing to travel

Did you regret it? Is there anyone here who got offered a sponsorship and turned it down to carry on travelling?",,False,self,t5_2qpcz,False,,,True,t3_1e4a19,http://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1e4a19/take_a_sponsorship_or_continue_backpacking/,

2. No flying. Land and sea based transportation only. With that in mind, does anyone know about ferries (or even just passenger ships) that can get me from North America to Europe? I'd prefer to go directly from Canada to Greenland, then to Iceland and finally mainland Europe, but I'm sure I can make do with anything else.
3. Never have more than 200 USD worth of currency on my person at any given time. Because of that, I'll need to be able to access my bank account at key points in my trip, such as when I'm buying train/ferry tickets, switching currency, or needing to stock up on supplies. Can anyone help on that?

Other Information

I'll be starting in Columbus, Ohio, the nearest train station to which is in Cleveland. Considering I'll want to get there the morning after I finish exploring Cleveland, what's a good city to start with from there? I'm mostly going to be traveling on a ""cheapest overnight train that's going somewhere new"" itinerary, but I'd like to kick off my adventure somewhere good. Further, when I finally get over to Europe, what are some good cities to shoot for?

So with all that in mind, my last question is mainly about how much this venture will cost. I don't want to be gone for too much more than six months before starting the trek home, so I'd like to be able to support myself through that whole time. Thanks to rule one, I can cut the cost of hotels out of the equation, but I'm still not entirely sure how much I'll need other than that it'll be something of the order of several thousands of dollars.

So then, can anyone help me out with planning my super ambitious quest?",,False,self,t5_2qpcz,False,,,True,t3_1frzcg,http://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1frzcg/im_making_plans_to_start_backpacking_all_around/,

Well, now I am on my way. Currently I am in Pittsburgh, via two bustrips yesterday, and am to begin my walking and hitching today. I realize my trip is a bit different from most backpackers who head into the wilderness, whereas I will be in and out of suburban and urban areas, but I think we share a kindred spirit. And wilderness backpacking is in my future, I just have very little experience and wanted to get the hang out of living out of a pack for a while first.

Anyway, I was just wondering if there were any other backpacking redditors that also travel via roadways and hitchhiking in addition to/instead of wilderness hikes? Would love to hear about some of your experiences.

I know a lot of people go travelling to fix problems like this, find themselves, become more confident in their own skin, etc and I'm thinking some of you might have done this.

I've gotten NSF funding to go to Japan this summer, and it comes with a ""summer stipend.""  I've always wanted to backback Southeast Asia and it looks like Uncle Sam is providing me the opportunity.

Setting aside plane tickets, how long can I reasonably travel in Thailand and Cambodia for $4000?

I've seen estimates that you can rent a motorcycle for $5/day, and bus/train fare being $30, or fancy hotels in over-priced tourist traps for $30/day.  That makes it look like one can easily do $50/day, but likely $25/day when staying out in the country or in backpacker lodging.

$4000 @ $50/day = 80 days.

Is two to three months a reasonable estimate?

Edit: Thanks for all the advice! I really appreciate it!  Especially hearing from so many people that $50/day will be more than enough to travel well. You guys are awesome!  Any more advice or tips obviously are welcome!

The past few months I've been spending most of my weekends out camping near the car and taking day hikes. I went from having almost no gear to having a small collection. I feel I'm almost 100% comfortable while camping near the car and want to get a backpack and try a 2 day trip or so now.

What I'm looking for is good tips for starting out in the backcountry and to check my gear list and look for suggestions.

I'm thinking for a first trip I'd try a long trail in Joshua Tree where I've spent a lot of time at lately, but it's dessert so of course not much water.

Clothing:            
* Syntheic REI Midweight Baselayer Shirt, considering a wool one.
* Active Venturewarm Longunderwear (Target - in my budget)
* Some polyester REI Adventure pants
* Ankle high boots ( Got them from big 5 for ~$40 but are very comfortable)
* Midlayer I use either Northface Momentum Fleece or Summit Series Windstopper. 
* Sierra Designs DriDown Jacket (no hood)
* Marmot Gortex Rain Shell
* Basic cotton gloves, warm me up unless there's a gust.

Sleep
* [This bag](http://www.big5sportinggoods.com/product/sleeping/478242-245278/hi-tec-infinity-5-degree-mummy-sleeping-bag.html#content) kept me warm enough at ~30 F. May consider getting a down eventually for compressibility mostly. I also have a small and cheap sleeping pad (not inflatable)
 
Water I carry a 1L and 0.5L Platypus and I also have a 2L camelpak.
Tent is nothing special, 2person tent $30 at walmart, no real complaints but never tried a good tent to compare it to. I don't have any sticks and no backpack yet, but a family member is going to loan me an old one. Sounds like it's ~50-65L 

Food I've been bringing some jerky, salami, dried fruits, a little trail mix, tuna and salmon in the packets, and some pita bread. I've been cooking with a single pan and a gasoline stove I got at a yard sale.

I am a senior in college and I have another semester after the summer before I graduate and get a job.  All of my friends are leaving this summer either to work or go home.  Fuck that.  I am also an avid (and fairly experienced) backpacker, so I'm thinking maybe I will go basically just live in the woods for a month or so this summer.  I just got done doing 30 miles on/around the AT in Tennessee and I loved it.  I want to basically be dropped off somewhere along the trail with all my gear, and just kind of go.  Not have any real plans or goals.  Maybe have some cool destinations marked on my maps or something.  So, kind sir or madam, if you have been gracious enough to read thus far, I have some questions.  

- Where along the Appalachian Trail should I start?  Any actual AT experience would be great to hear about as well. 

- Do you have any experience with extended backpacking trips (as in more than a week), and if so, do you have any tips?  

- Do you think I am a complete idiot?

- What might I need for a long trip that doing short trips wouldn't prepare me for?

I know I will have some planning to do as far as food, weather, and stuff like that.  But that is for later.  I'm still thinking big picture.  I will update as I think of more stuff.  Maybe.

I should get a camera.  And a harmonica.

EDIT:  The 30 mile hike isn't my only trip.  I have done about 8 different multi day trips over the past 2 years.

There's also different kinds of chemical tabs for purification but there seem to be a few  different options for that including iodine and the packaging doesn't always seem to be clear on what sort they are.

How does it handle rough weather? At least twice a year I do a couple 10k+ trips and will see some wind and heavy rain, even a little snow. Nothing that would require a 4-season tent, but I'm curious what you've experienced.

The most I can take off work is 2 weeks, so I was planning on doing 1 week outside of Brazil, one week in Brazil.  29-M, I have a good job and CAN afford a more expensive trip, but I more typically relate to backpackers and always just hanging out in those areas anyway.  So with that in mind, here are my questions:

1.  Is first week out of Brazil, second week in Brazil a good split of time?  Would you do it differently?
2.  For the week out of Brazil, I was thinking spending a good portion of that in Buenos Aires.  I love immersing myself in a city, and a good 4-5 days to take it in would be great.  But is there any place else you suggest going?  Patagonia would be great, but it'll be way too cold (I think).  
3.  For Brazil, all I'm really set on is Rio.  It'll be the first week of the WC, but I don't really know what else to do after that.  Would you stay in Rio, or would you go elsewhere in Brazil?  Where would you go, what would you do?
4.  Or, given the constraints of 2 weeks, with a mandatory stop in Rio for the WC, how would you plan the trip?  

The World Cup is obviously the reason I'm going, but I want to be able to have a kick-ass time doing more than just that.  I'm looking to tap into your collective experiences!  Is there something that I absolutely must see/experience?

I am thinking of traveling between July 13 and July 31 (dates are somewhat flexible). I don't foresee any time in the near future where I will have more than 1 week off at a time, so I really want to make the most of it. In other words, I want to travel places that I can only really do with one more week, because other locations I'm sure I can do at another time.

Few other background notes:
1. I'm a 24 year old male
2. I live in New York
3. My budget is 8,000-10,000
4. I will be traveling alone (and have done a couple solo trips before in Paris and Argentina, but they weren't really ""backpacking"")
5. I am an Asian American, fluent in English and conversational in Spanish



So these are the 3 places I'm trying to choose between, would love to hear your thoughts:



**Australia / NZ**

Pros:

* English speaking - makes traveling easier
* Great Beaches in Australia for surfing
* Great Hiking in New Zeland
* Lots of other backpackers I could meet
* Could go to ""Splendour in the Grass"" which seems like an awesome music festival

Cons:

* Its winter in Australia - maybe not the best time to go?



**Peru**

Pros

* Can hike Macchu Picchu
* Can go surfing on the beach
* Rainforest
* I speak spanish
* Much cheaper

Cons

* Maybe not as safe to travel alone
* Probably could do in a week from New York, but maybe not both Macchu Picchu and surfing


**Eastern Europe (Austria, Czech, Croatia, &amp; Hungary)**

Pros:

* Beautiful countries
* I think easiest to travel around
* Lots of backpackers to meet
* Hiking

Cons:

* No beach
* Also possible to do in a week trip from New York


My choices are ranked as above (Australia as the front runner, E Europe as last choice)

1. Is it not a good time to visit Australia because its in the winter?

I am tossing up between a [One Planet](http://www.oneplanet.com.au/travel/longreach.html) (they are aussie and the quality of their bags seems to be second to none) and an [Osprey](http://www.ospreypacks.com/en/product/backpacking/waypoint_85_-_mens).

The Osprey is higher spec in that it has more pockets, more travel friendly features and a better day pack but the build quality doesn't look as good as the One Planet. One Planet bags look and feel as if they will last forever (which they should at ~$500). 

My worry is that I am not the most caring person when it comes to my belongings and the bag will be knocked around a fair bit. There is also a good chance it will get wet at some point so a fair amount of water proofing would be useful (without a rain cover).


So Osprey owners: has you pack ever broken? Any clips broken? Any tears?
And how is the water proofing? If I get caught in a downpour will my stuff get wet in an Osprey bag?

**EDIT** 

Thanks for all the replys everybody! It has been super helpful! I decided to go with the Osprey Waypoint 85 even though you all said it is too big. I went with this cause I will have winter gear and I dont want to be limited if I want to buy something whilst away. Plus weight doesnt fuss me. I take it as an opportunity to get some more muscle!

We had been in the campsite about 15 minutes when my buddy points out a family (2 big, 2 little) of bears (e. Black) at 40ft ambling towards us.  I know you're supposed to be loud and bang on stuff, but we snuck away calmly and quietly because the cooking food was between us and the bears and we were able to exit screen left and watch the devastation from a safe distance.  Every time they left we would sneak back to pick up our scattered gear and they would come right back, play with the non food stuff and walk off again.

I'd like to take fault for this incident.  I could learn from it and it wouldn't happen again, but I don't know what I could have done differently to prevent it.  I attribute the incident to bad timing and established campsites where bears can just walk up and do their top predator thing like yogi bear.  I didn't really think they were going to attack us any of the times we met, but let the record show, I was terrified.

So during this escapade I thought of some questions I'd like to put to the community.  If I carry bear mace, should I have been loud and used it then? On anything that came at me, even the babies? What's the probability of failure?  What happens to maced bears?  Did I do the right thing by taking the opportunity to escape instead of challenging it for our food (and water...today was a dry 9 miles) even if I had mace?

I plan on buying a backpack around the $80 range and am currently looking at Sports Authority, REI, etc. 

For food, I might take some Nature Valley bars and some freeze dried foods enough to last a couple weeks and buy some more food along the way. I also plan on buying some hiking shoes before attempting backpacking for the first time. 

My friends recommend that before I even begin to plan my route across the US, heading north (starting from my native area of North Texas), that it would be best to backpack for a day then come back on day 2. I am only off two days a week at my job, so those two consecutive days would be my only time to practice what they are suggesting. They say that doing this often would help me prepare. Of course I would take a leave of absence or something before backpacking across the country. I am pretty impatient and stubborn,though, and am really wanting to just read up on couch surfing, plan my route, get the necessary supplies, and just go. However, it is possible that my stubbornness may end up dooming me if I am not careful.

* thermal underwear for upper and lower body

* wool mittens

should i spend a little more and get different pants and other jackets/sweaters?

Pros:      
- Airplane mode for extended battery life      
- Can be used for camera and music in airplane mode      
- Can turn on wifi whilst in airplane mode for use in hotspots. This would be to arrange couch surfing, or wwoof hosts etc.       
- Wouldn't have to drag a laptop around in my backpack      

Cons      
- At much greater risk of robbery/ loss      
- Finding places to charge it      
- Battery could drain at the wrong time      
- Having 9999 x sim cards for different countries

My passport comes through in a few weeks from now, and as of April next year, I'm going somewhere, anywhere away from here. This will leave me without a proper home as I'll be opting out of living with the people I currently live with.      

My question to you guys is, where to travel first? Tell me a story from your early days of travelling, how you got into it, lessons you learned etc. Any views from someone who's travelled without much money would be amazing, what they did to occupy themselves, how they survived etc.      

I will be by myself as I think it's necessary for the kind of journey I want to go on (I only speak English unfortunately). Any European perspectives would be nice as it's all on my doorstep and is financially viable, but anywhere else is great too. I will be travelling on a very low budget, hopefully WWOOFing and CouchSurfing etc, but I'm not really sure where to start with it all, I'm slightly overwhelmed with options and ideas.

I just spent the last two nights compiling my gear list and weight of each item.  I'm looking for ways to ""cheaply"" cut down on excess weight.  I'm not looking to spend $300 on a new backpack, but I am open to cheaper suggestions!

I weighed all the gear that I had / based off of websites like REI. I realize that my numbers are relatively conservative, I'd rather overestimate though.  More than likely I'll be carrying all the communal gear as well, since I'm relatively in shape and it's my own personal gear.

And no, I can't get rid of my fishing pole!  I absolutely love fishing with my G Loomis everywhere I go.

We'd pack our stuff up and hike to the camp, but the camp had clean running water within a short distance, and we'd bring the food in after we had set up camp.  I realized this really wasn't backpacking.

So, being in Colorado, I would like to go for a three day backpacking trip, and later on take my son (10 years old) once I was able to see what was up, and what to expect.

Problem is, I'm not sure I understand how the process works.  I have a few questions.

1.  Seems like, if I take off on a trip, I park my car (I suppose I could have someone drop me off and meet me when I'm done), hike in a very large circle, and get back in my car and head back home.  Is that about right?
2.  I know pretty much what to pack, but the issue of water comes up.  I see recommendations of 2+ quarts per day.  But where will I refill?  Does everyone just hike along creeks and rivers so they can fill up (and filter/purify) as needed?  Water is HEAVY!
3.  How do I figure out where to start the hike?  I'm not too familiar with the mountains out here.  Where can I set up camp at the end of each day?  What's the average distance a novice backpacker can cover in a day?  What about a 10 year old kid?
4.  What about bears, mountain lions, and other animals?  Will I be in danger unless I tie my food up in a tree?  Will I be in danger regardless?

I'm turning 18 this week and I've got the travel bug. High school ends in June and I'm looking to go to far off places. I've lived in the Dominican Republic and traveled East To West and back again across Canada and Northern USA. I am also fluent in Spanish and French.

I'm a little overwhelemed because of all the options. I want to start things off as good as I can. I've been thinking of doing a run through Austria, Hungary, Germany and The Netherlands, but I've heard the last two are overly expensive. I've been reading travel blogs and such, and I've heard SE Asia was a great and inexpensive place to travel.

I'd also like some veterans to help me fill my bags with the right stuff. I've heard a lot of conflicting opinions on what to bring, what's worth buying here vs abroad, and stuff like that.

A big problem for me is that I generally hide in my shell unless I have a friend, and I can't convince any to come with me. Are there any areas/countries that encourage or almost enforce that people socialize.

My main goal here is to experience cultures, music, scenery and people that are completely different from what I've experienced. Especially the scenery and people. I want to find places where I talk about the stuff that isn't on the brochure, I want to meet like-minded people, and make memories. Are there any resources that I can use to help me do this?

I have some questions pertaining to my tentative itinerary, but also the fact that I'm young woman traveling through Europe by myself.
I want to arrive in Edinburgh (2 nights), Glasgow (2 nights), London (4 nights), Paris (3 nights), Angers (3 nights), Antwerpen, Belgium (1 night), Maastricht, Holland (3 nights), Utrecht (3 nights), The Hague (4 nights), Amsterdam (3 nights), Berlin (3 nights), Prague (3 nights), go home from Prague. I have purposefully scheduled quite a few nights in Holland because my mother was born there, but I'm feeling unsure about the amount of nights I've chosen for each city. As I understand it, since Holland is such a small country, the cities aren't too far from each other. But since this country holds some personal meaning to me, I want to stay there for a bit longer than other countries. Should I schedule more nights in other bigger cities? I figure when I'm in Den Haag I'll visit Delft since it's close by, and Rotterdam, etc. Does this sound like a solid itinerary or where should I make some tweaks?

Also, since this tentative itinerary contains seven countries, I was thinking of utilizing the Eurail. However, France is not apart of the deal, so that makes things complicated. If I were to fly into Edinburgh, traverse south to London (using the Eurail??), then taking the chunnel to Paris, train to Angers, train to Antwerpen, then utilize the Eurail deal from Belgium to The Netherlands, then Berlin, then Prague. Also as I understand it, the Eurail counts Belgium and The Netherlands as one country?

At this point, I feel most confused about transportation. I hear the public transit is very easy and accessible throughout Europe (completely foreign to these LA ears), so in a situation like this would purchasing a three country pass be most efficient?

Finally, as a female, does anyone have any basic wisdom for my travels? I have been utilizing couchsurfing to correspond with other women throughout these countries so I can meet new friends, but just curious if there any basic tips. :) (Aside from the obvious, like don't go walking by yourself at night, etc.)

Well, I have found the ultimate lightweight firestarter. I use, waterproof matches, a piece of paper towel, and Vasoline.

I'm from London in the UK and I'm planning on coming to work on farms for a period in July/August via the WWOOF network. For anyone who doesn't know what that is, take a look on Google, it's the best opportunity to travel and gain new experiences that I have come across. I plan to work on farms for maybe 2 weeks at a time, and backpack my way around Canada in between farms, which is why I'm here.  

I'm looking for other people who may be interested, and I thought what better place to start than here!
I'm planning on working around the Kootenays, maybe working my way further north in BC. As I would be coming in from the UK, I will be landing in Vancouver, and will then have to find my way from there, however means necessary.  

So a bit of background info on me; I'm 21, open minded and I like to think I have a good heart. I have always loved adventure, but living in the constraints of a city and education, have had little time to fulfil my ambitions. So as you might have guessed, my knowledge of rural living and camping etc isn't great. This is my main reason for throwing myself in at the deep end like this, I learn well under huge amounts of pressure. So I hope to learn about how to sustain myself out in the wild and learn a little more about the world we live in by placing myself so far out of my comfort zone like this.  

I might be coming with one other friend, but there is a higher possibility I will be by myself, as most of my friends don't really dig the kind of lifestyle I want. So anyone who is into organic farming or generally wants an adventure, feel free to let me know here. I'm free as a bird from June till September.

I've only ever stayed at a backpackers once before so I generally wouldn't know what to expect. (I don't plan to make it any kind of commercial enterprise - just to kill the boredom, meet new people and perhaps cover some living expenses)

Some questions:

* Is this something any 'ol schmo can do, or is generally not worth the hassle?
* I have 2 washing machines and a large hot water system. What else would be essential?
* Is there a good 'backpacking etiquette' guide that someone can point me towards?
* How is money handled? What should I charge? and what is generally expected in return?
* Any other nuggets of wisdom?

It's a fairly large place with quite a lot of character. It is a bit run-down, but I'm spending a lot of time at the moment getting it to a nice comfortable state - having said that, it is very livable at the moment.

My brother is going to be biking in Colorado and it's basically going to be 10 days from the start of the trip till he can resupply.

The problem is, he needs about 5,000 calories a day as light as possible and on the cheap. He's got a bunch of tuna but there's very little calories to be gained from that. He's also got oatmeal and instant mashed potatoes, but those are also fairly insignificant calorie wise. Also getting beef jerky, but even that isn't super dense calorie wise, but he is bringing it for the protein. So basically what we have is 1oz Jerky, 3 packets tuna, 2 packets oatmeal, and 5 servings powdered gatorade per day and that only amounts to about 2,000 calories.

What could he eat that is very dense in calories, and high in useful nutrients?

A couple years back, I took half a gap-year and travelled with the 25L and the Arcteryx's daypack strapped onto it.  It worked pretty well, had just about the right amount of room.

I'd like to use a new backpack in much the same way, but add a bit of capacity with which to bring a tent/sleeping bag with me, and be able to carry my jacket inside the bag instead of strapped to the outside.  Also, the 25L didn't have a proper waist belt and that's a definite need.

So, roughly what I think I want:

• Around 50L total, absolute max 60L.  Part of that as a daypack, so maybe 40+10, or 50+10.
• Good belt of course.
• Day pack.
• Durable.
• Water system, etc. not absolutely necessary.

So, any suggestions on best options?",,False,self,t5_2qpcz,False,,,True,t3_13pvr6,http://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/13pvr6/backpack_suggestions/,

How often are run-ins with beers and mountain lions (I'm in southern California, so more mountain lions)?

2.  [STOVE](http://domsoutdoor.com/Primus+Technotrail+II+Stove/p/1-042626/sid/Froogle/eid/FR1/) i only paid 18 bucks for it.  Other than this i would purchase either the MSR Pocket Rocket or a good stove with a piezo ignitor.

3. [BACKPACK](http://www.gregorypacks.com/products/mens/technical/15/baltoro-70) i have the orange one from last year though.  I have used both spectrums of packs.  I have used a pack that came in a box with a tent and sleeping back for $99 US.  It hurt every part of my body, and now i have used a $300 pack (although i didnt pay that much) and the difference is shockingly different.  The comfort difference is something i can't describe to you!

4.  [WATER PURIFICATION](http://www.rei.com/product/671111)  A lot of high elevation lakes or streams in the US don't require this but i take it anyway, i never go on any trip (outside of a hotel) without a water purification system.

5.  [FIRE STARTER](http://www.campingsurvival.com/hstmafi.html) with a wood handle.  This is a great item in an emergency especially if you are somewhere cold or wet. You scrape the handle to make a pile of wood shaving and then you scrape the magnesium on the top of the wood and then you scrape the firesteel to spark it all to life.  I didn't get mine from this guy, i live in Portland Oregon and there is a guy at our Saturday market downtown that sells them.  A great tool.   

6.  [Tent](http://www.trails.com/review_6923_sierra-sirius-tent-review.html), Its a 3 season tent, the best tent for the money at the time.  Its 2 years old.  No idea whats out there now, but get a tent with good ventilation and i have learned that you generally go above the ""person limit"".  For instance if you and your wife/SO are going backpacking dont buy a two person tent, buy a three person tent, especially if the weight diff. is small.  Most people end up taking a lot of crap inside the tent which can crowd things.  If you think you can handle keeping most of your stuff outside the by all means go lighter and get the two person version.  I'm all for lighter!

7.[Folding saw](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IAZDAO/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;cloe_id=50d3dc8b-6451-4d92-881f-a381520b483f&amp;attrMsgId=LPWidget-A1&amp;pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=B000EI0W0Q&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=00N8692ZCPYQMTFET5EP)  Don't bring an axe bring a pruning saw!!!  I can't stress this enough.  You will waste so much energy chopping through wood with an axe, especially if you only want a fire for a couple of hours.   Use a saw, saw through half dead log or branch and then place half of it on a log or branch and jump on it to split it, don't bother cutting through the whole thing.  When we camp we have two people sawing logs, and one person jumping on the slices we make.  Firewood comes very quickly.  =P  

8.[sleeping pad](http://www.rei.com/product/778146)  Do not EVER go backpacking without one.  Even if it is just a foam pad.  The comfort level skyrockets with very little weight added.  Oh and i you are trying to introduce someone to backpacking let THEM use the pad.  Otherwise, chances are that person will hate it.

9.[FISHING POLE](http://www.emrod.com/index.cfm?page=products.cfm&amp;cat=2) i love this thing, you should always bring something with you to be able to make your own food.

* Able to carry a variable load - I don't always have exactly 30 L of stuff.  I would like to be able to carry the bag empty or half full and still have it be comfortable 
* Good back support.  

------------

Examples of what I am considering: 

**[MEC Spirit 30 Daypack](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Packs/Daypacks/TopLoad/PRD~5024-833/mec-spirit-30-daypack.jsp)**

I actually bought this bag and used it for a weekend but am planning on returning it because of the following problems.  

* The hip strap is very uncomfortable.  It does not distribute weight well and is very sharp.  

* The bag doesn't carry 15 L of gear very well.  The two cinch straps will only tighten up the bottom 2/3 of the bag.  This leaves the top half uncinched and flopping around.  The bag doesn't hold its shape when it is not full. The back will bend.  Maybe something with a stronger more serious internal frame would help to address this..?

* The top zipper is very hard to close.  Very sticky.  Not sure if I have a defective bag or if it is poorly made.  

* The shoulder straps are too close together at the top of the back  unless you have an ultra thin neck this probably won't fit you.  


**[Black Diamond Speed 30 Daypack](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Packs/Daypacks/TopLoad/PRD~5023-880/black-diamond-speed-30-daypack-unisex.jsp)**

* Looks more expandable.  Top can be filled or folded down
* Will try the hip belt to see if it is more comfortable.
* Had dynamic suspension.  Will need to try this out to see what it means or if it feels good.  


-----------

Side note: I have a [Mec Brio 70](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Packs/WeekendAlpinePacks/PRD~4012-402/mec-brio-70-backpack.jsp) that has been great.  I guess what I am looking for is a big bag harness and frame on a little bag.  I don't mind a reasonable weight penalty.

I know it should be a simple ""eat more, gain weight,"" but for the life of me I can't gain weight. So my question is: how much should this be a serious concern for me?

It's for me and my wife (our daughter is not yet 2yo, but maybe next year or year after she'll come camping with us).

I'm into it because of the easy set up (clips no sleeves, and just two simple poles), double doors, all mesh top, relatively light weight for a 3p tent, and low price.

The only con to it that I can see is possibly low headroom due to the dome shape of it.

I don't know much about the different brands either, and there's not all that much in this sub or /r/CampingandHiking about Sierra Designs, so maybe you guys can shed some light on the company and their quality.

The other tent I've been looking at is the ALPS Aries 3 http://www.alpsmountaineering.com/alps/products/tents/backpacking-tents/aries, which seems slightly more complicated to set up but seems to offer more headroom.

Is there a specific method of packing (eg: heavy stuff on the bottom of the pack, lighter things on top) that have any benefits other than rummaging through to find things? 

One example/question I have is that a lot of backpacks have ""zippered sleeping bag compartments"" on the bottom. I usually put my food and random stuff in there, and my sleeping bag in the main compartment.

packing: 

* you only need essentials. how essential this is is up to you. for example i met people with one set of clothing they washed in the sink every night.

* you will very very likely not need a sleepingbag

* i am fine without a second small bag, if you have 3 pockets you should be fine for the day. (i just carry a wallet, a camera, a knife and i keep a waterbottle in my hand.)

* get light trekking shoes. some you can also use for cycling/running and just sports in general. for the other 95% you'll probably wear flipflops or sandals. only take one of the previous

places to go:

* i met a lot of people who didn't like bangkok but others find it great. it's really hard to say.

* don't go directly from bangkok to chiang may, stop on the way! visit lop buri for a few hours, stay a night in old sukhothai. 

* if you go to laos, take the slowboat frm huay xai, it's 25$ and takes two days, but you'll arrive in lauang prabang with a big group and you'll have a good time with them in the bowling alley.

* if you're in laos, check out vang vieng! the tubing is closed, but the whiskey costs 1€ a bottle. but i didn't fall in love with the place for the rubing or the irish pub, but for the beauty of the mountains. stay in a bungalow on the other side of the river and just relax a few days.

* in the south go to the 4000 islands. don dett is a great hive for friendly backpackers and great to get a tan on.

* of course you have to visit ankor. you could push through it in a day, but take two, it's worth it.

skams:

* you're in bangkok and it's buddha day? it's not. nothing is closed, you can see everything.

* your tucktuck is ""only"" 100baht to the station? it should be more like 80. and no, you won't do the driver a favor and stop at a taylor/travel agency or somewhere else.

* you travel by train and you're paying more than 300 baht? why did you buy the first class ticket? get second class, it's almost as fast and a lot cheaper.

* if you buy something (except for electronics) that's the same price as in europe, haggle the shit out of them. last night here in cambodia for example, a girl wanted 20$ for a necklace. when i didn't want it she ended up wanting 5$ for it.

* if you are considering booking something and want a night to think, never leave deposit. i was told about a wlesh guy in bangkok running away with the deposit every night.

* if you go to laos/thailand for less the 14 days it's free. don't pay 30$. and if you go to cambodia, check if you're getting a visa for 30 or 90 days. 30 is 20-25$, 90 days is at least 40$.

dangers: 

* big fullmoon parties are VERY dangerous. watch for roofies and other drugs. even the guys. i met enough people who had blackouts after 2 or 3 drinks.

* watch you're stuff. it's not the asians on the street i worry about, it's the backpackers in the dorms.

* don't start a fight with an asian. he'll have more guys to back him up. usually they are very friendly, but once they snap the get crazy.

* malaria is an issue here, no matter how little it seems. wear strong insect repellent, especially in cambodia.

* drugs. don't try ""happy shakes"" when shrooms are involved and watch your barkeeper. ""what was that pill you just put in?"" -""MDMA""... also there are ""deet-cocktails"". cocktails with small amounts of insect repellent. people died just last week from that stuff. 

* deet95. it's the strongest insect repellent you can get, but it in poisonous. don't inhale, don't spray it in closed rooms you want to sleep in later and don't spray in a face (unless you think pepperspray is too nice).

general advice:

* it's hard to stay alone. you'll always find someone with the same destination if you keep your eyes open. and traveling in pairs in cheaper, as you can share rooms, tucktucks and so on.

* watch your camera. you don't want to break it/loose it. vang vieng is a camera graveyard so don't take it tubing, even if it's waterproof.

* when you walk through a forest or ricefields always stomp a little. it scares the snakes away. 

* just because he's a monk doesn't mean he's not an asshole.

* don't buy souvenirs until you're getting to the end of your journey. you don't want them broken and every kilo of dead weight is annoying.  

* laos currently has a curfew, but it's not that bad. in luang pranbang the bowling alley stays open hours longer than the bars, so it's a merry drinking spot

* don't take a whole laptop. netbooks are the best, as the are small and you can still upload pictures from the SD card of your camera. except for the thing with the pictures, smartphones are all you need. and if you're willing to stay of of facebook and reddit for a week, you can just go to the next internet cafe. as a young backpacker it is nice to keep my family updated often enough, as they are a little worried. it depends on you, but a laptop is just dead weight",,False,self,t5_2qpcz,1354266525.0,,,True,t3_141han,http://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/141han/here_are_some_tips_for_thailand_laos_and_cambodia/,

This is officially my first Reddit post. I'm a huge backpacker with a background in webdesign/digital marketing/PR/etc. I'm at the point in my life where I'm wanting to do something that I actually want to do. 

I've been considering starting a backpacking website with blogs/news/gear reviews/videos/etc. for some time now, and I wanted to come to you to see:

What would you, the community, want in a backpacking website? What is most valuable to you when looking at other backpacking websites? What do they not have that you wish they did? I've of course been to just about every other site out there, and I think I could ""do it right"" as it were. Of course we all think that about some things, but I think I'm actually going to make it happen. 

Thanks for any and all feedback. This is something that I'm really hoping will come to fruition, and I want to do it the right way.

I never have more than three people, but 90% of the time it's just myself and one other. Is 115L bag too much? My idea is that I can fit all my food,any thing with a scent, and anything that CANNOT get wet in the hooligan barrel. Then fit my tent, sleeping bag kitchen set etc, in the Sealline bag, and be done with. I bought the Dragonfly stove and Alpinist 2 stove set last year as well, so I've really cut down on space/size.

We go camping a lot and have a big tent and big heavy cotton sleeping bags. Can't take those with us (they're HEAVY) and so we're trying to determine the best sleeping bag options for us. 

The thing is, we're small people who don't take up a lot of space and we sleep very close together anyway, especially when camping since it wards off the chill. We usually end up usually zipping the bags together and have tons of empty (read: cold) space left over. The idea came up that instead of buying two bags and two sleeping mats, we could just get one big fat bag and one big fat mat and be just as well off comfort-wise, with the added bonuses of 1) spending less money 2) carrying less total weight and 3) fitting into a smaller, more portable, tent than we would with two sets.

Has anybody ever done this? Does it sound insane? Can you think of any issues that we might come across doing it that way?

- Flexibility to get anywhere (especially campgrounds) within 5-10 miles without much trouble

- Saving money by avoiding taxis, busses, etc.

- Fitness

My reasons for wanting a folding bike specifically:

- I can carry it onto trains without much trouble

- Less risk of it being stolen because it will be with me almost at all times

(Photographer),asz17,8,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/vuvtt/new_backpacker_advice_needed_photographer/,"So I'm off to South East Asia soon for my first real backpacking adventure with some friends. We are going for a month, from Kunming, China to Bangkok, Thailand. Were covering over 700 miles, and plan on stopping in Vietnam and Laos. I've been all over the world before, but this trip is a little different than another I've been on. 

I still have yet to buy a backpack, but I've been looking around. From what I understand I need to pack for about 10 days of clothes, extra shirts and socks, iodine pills, water bottle, utility knife, some books, water proof jacket, rain cover, rechargeable batteries, deet.... I'm sure I'm missing some things so please let me know. 

Whats the right sized backpack for this trip? Around 5000 cu inches and somewhere around 85 liters is my impression.

My friends also bought sleeping bags for this trip- is this necessary? I'd like to save money where I can. we plan on sleeping in hostels, and cheap stays- but we all know plans can get pretty messed up, quickly too.

I also am a photographer and won't be able to utilize my daily camera bag; however, I'd Like to bring two camera a Nikon D700 and F100, and three lenses at most.  thoughts? I know it will add weight.

From previous experiences of fellow redditors, myself and my two friends would really appreciate any advice and input- especially from photographers for myself!


Thanks in advanced!

We have a group of 3 experienced backpackers, not so much in very cold weather though. When I search Google there are so many trails and other options that I feel overwhelmed. We would like to do at least 4 or 5 days out in the back-country and maybe a flight tour of the mountain or some other organized activity. The planned dates are between August 15 and Sep 1.

Both of these sound good from backpacker magazine. Would anyone comment on one of these trips or make another suggestion please?

&gt;1) Go straight to Denali National Park and get a permit for whichever backcountry zone is available—we like units 12 and 13, for the Mt. Eielson Loop (Trip ID 479100), if you can get it. The full-immersion trip in glacier-grizzly country makes this a no-brainer if you have the time and chops. 

&gt;2) Skip the permit crapshoot and routefinding challenge and hike the 27-mile Kesugi Ridge, in nearby Denali State Park. This long, treeless spine offers front-row panoramas of Mt. McKinley, and the easy-to-follow trail is a better choice for hikers who are uncomfortable navigating the national park’s trailless expanse or crossing glacial-melt rivers (the ridge hike has no difficult fords). “You’ll have unobstructed views for days, and the trail lets you cover more ground than on a typical Alaska hike,” says Executive Editor Dennis Lewon, who covered the hike for our “Alaska Made Easy” feature (May 2003",,False,self,t5_2qpcz,False,,,True,t3_v8j5q,http://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/v8j5q/planning_a_trip_to_denali_for_late_august_any/,

My feet are quite narrow with a very high arch. My first question is: do the mid/full boots actually provide ankle support and aid in the prevention of ankle sprains, or is the extra height really just there to prevent water from seeping in if you step in a deep puddle?

A little more context: I have sprained/rolled my ankles more times than I care to remember. I had surgery on my right ankle to repair the ligaments a few years ago but have also had issues with the left one. Only a few months after the surgery I took a bad fall on a multi-day hike along the wild coast of south africa and sprained the ankle I'd had surgery on just months before. I was about 3 days walk from anything that resembled civilization so had no choice but to continue on a badly sprained ankle. The ankle healed after time and the hike was, well, wonderful to say the least. here is a pic for anyone interested: http://i.imgur.com/JHmvk.jpg

Back to point: 
What type of shoe should I look at getting given my presumed weak ankles, narrow foot, and high arch? I don't like carrying around extra weight, so the lighter the better, but I am willing to compromise on this point for the sake of avoiding future injuries to my ankles.

A buddy of mine and I were planning a trip up north on the Lost Coast Trail.  Plans are just not coming together for this tip.  At first we are a bit apprehensive that we can make the entire 25mile trip in two nights / three days.  Every ranger I've talked to says pushing a pace of 8miles per day on the sand is really moving.  Neither of us have any experience hiking or camping on the beach so we're a bit nervous of parking one car at one end and another at the other end and jumping in and committing to the whole 25miles without knowing what we're getting into.

So we planned on making a shorter trip, by starting at an insertion point halfway through and hiking out cutting the trip down to about 15-20 miles in 3 days which would be much more manageable.   Well after doing some more digging it's likely that the access road is a 20mile gnarly 4wd only trail that is currently closed and doesn't generally open until may. (we're planning on going around the end of april).  On top of that to hire a shuttle to drop us off at this insertion point would cost $200.  Neither of us are excited about doing that.

So.  That leaves us with 2 choices.  hiking in/out which to me seems kinda lame.  OR saddling up on a different trail.  We are starting out in the Bay Area so anything within 2-3 hours drive north/south of there would be awesome.  We'd like to do some beach trails and camping to give us a better idea of what we're getting into with the Lost Coast Trail which we plan on doing later when it's a bit more feasible.

TLDR:  Friend and I are nervous to do the 25mile Lost Coast Trail in 2 nights.  Looking for alternative 15-20 mile beach trail that will give us a better gauge of our ability and pace hiking in the sand.

I need your help. I'm hoping that the title is pretty self explanatory as far as what I am about to ask. I would love to plan a backpacking trip across Europe. For those of you who have done it, whether solo, or with 1 or more people, I would LOVE (need) a list of the pros and cons of both. 

I would like to say that I did my best to research a post related to this topic specifically, but had no luck. I'm mentioning that because I understand that a ridiculous amount of posts asking the same question about the same topic gets redundant. So if there is a thread about this topic, that I missed or overlooked please feel free to point me in the right direction! 

Anywho, onto business. I have an idea of a pros/cons list of traveling solo vs with companions, however being that I've never backpacked across Europe before, I know my list(s) will potentially be lacking, and so that is where I need all you veterans to throw your two cents in! 

Traveling SOLO:

Cons (that I'd imagine)-
--Being a young 20 something female
--Staying in hostels that are creepier than what I'd like to stay in alone
--Being lonely/not having anyone to immediately share my ""in awe"" reactions
--Not having anyone to talk to 24/7
--safety
--getting homesick more easily

Pros:
--I can move, work, and travel on my own schedule
--I can eat when and where I want without having to take extra time to ""figure out what we want to eat that we all agree on""
--I can see/do only the things I want
--I don't have to give  up sights I want to see to accommodate the rest of the group
--I don't have to see sights I don't want to see to accommodate the rest of the group. 
--I don't have to worry about ""getting sick of"" the people I'm traveling with. (You know what happens when you spend too much time with someone you've NEVER spent that much with with)

Okay, well....I thought my list would be longer but my brain farted out on me - I'm also realizing the pros and cons of traveling alone vs solo are just inverted, so I didn't even make a list for traveling in a group. 

A few of the things I listed may seem selfish, but I understand planning a trip like this costs a significant amount of money, so the selfish perspective is just making sure I get the most out of what I pay for.

I found one in a store that was small enough for my liking, but I could feel that it didn't have that much isolation.

Right now I'm getting started back up in backpacking after being away from it for.....9 years or so (since highschool). I picked up a few of the things I needed at this past REI garage sale, but I'm in need of a number of items yet. Specifically I need a tent and a sleeping bag that will work for me for the next few years. Money's a bit tight as I'm also in the process of selling my house and moving, so please consider that in any feedback you send me. 

I plan to do three season camping right now, though I doubt I'd go out very early in the spring or very late in the fall (for now). In other words I don't think I'm going to need an extreme temp sleeping bag. I should however point out that one of the first trips I'm going on will be in the desert, so there will definitely be some cold weather to deal with there. 

So with that in mind, what do you guys think? Any less expensive brands that are known for having decent quality? Also I live in the Chicago land area and usually look at REI out of convenience, but I realize they aren't the cheapest place you could shop. Any online outlets that people recommend?

I'm new to travelling, and will be going on my first solo backpacking trip to Europe later this year.

I'll be backpacking for at least a month, but it will probably be longer than this. I will also be going on more trips after this one. So a real durable, handy bag is something I'm looking for. I don't know what size I should look for. I've heard many people say to go less than what you expect, while others have said go a little bigger. I'm not a big guy, 5'9"" 140lbs not sure if that's helpful. Something comfy, durable, and useful is what I'm looking for. I don't want to break my bank account, but I am willing to spend on a durable/good backpack.

Also, when travelling with a backpack do you check your main bag? Or do you look for one that meets the limits, so you can bring it as carry on?

As you may have guessed from the title, these here are some questions about backpacking across Europe. Also this is my first time, so please be thorough in your answers! As well, if it helps in any way, I am Canadian.

Onto the questions!


1. What are some ""must-see attractions"" for a backpacker to see?

2. What are some not-so-well-known-places for one to visit?

3. Anything about European cultures that are good to know? Any taboo subjects not to bring up?

More backpacking orientated questions:

1. What would one pack?

2. Sleeping quarters, benches, hostels? Are they reliable? 

3. Backpacking partners, recommended? Not recommended? Why?

3. What would one probably expect to encounter? Any advice on how to deal with these situations?

5. What's a good budget to have? How do you manage your money? What if it gets stolen?

6. Do you buy little souvenirs? If yes, do you send them home right away?

Thanks in advance for taking the time to read.

I post here quite often, but am torn about what to do with my own summer. I'm 25, and normally I'd say that I love art, culture, etc... I'd like to see some of that, but after months at an office job, I really want to stretch my legs and get outside. In August, I begin a program in digital media in my hometown of Boston. The program goes straight through next summer, so this is probably one of my last opportunities to travel for an extended period. 

I'm hoping to travel to exercise, clear my mind, and maybe get some creative inspiration for what will be a very grueling year. I know Canada quite well, and will have to visit relatives in Vancouver at the end of the summer. Budget? $4,000. Time frame? 60 days. June 7 to August 7.

In sum:

**Likes:**

 * Outdoors
 * Hiking
 * Walkable cities
 * Meeting / hanging out with other people in their mid-twenties

**Dislikes:**

 * I've traveled through Europe extensively, and would probably not consider doing that again.
 * I'm not that keen on South East Asia, as I hate humidity with a fiery passion.
 * Mosquitoes and/or large, flying cockroaches. The Philippines: never again.
 * Sitting all day every day. Do plenty of that at work.


If you have any ideas about the following options, or have new suggestions, that would be fantastic! 

**Road Trip USA:** I've always wanted to drive from New York, down the east coast, through the south, and then through California--already have the itinerary planned (many national parks and iconic American landscapes). I have friends I could stay with in South Carolina and California, but I worry about making friends in other places. I imagine trucking through South Carolina --&gt; LA solo might get lonely.

**Crazy Hiking Expedition** Something completely off the wall, like liking the Pacific Trail or hiking from city to city in Peru. Great Smoky Mountains could be an option, or the Appalachian trail, or the John Muir trail. I feel like these could be the most fulfilling, but also the loneliest. 

**Stay home:** Stay home, work double-time to help save up for school (bringing loans I'll have to take out from about $7,000 down to $2,000), and do day-trips on the weekends. 

**Working Holiday, Ireland:** I'v looked into the visa, and this seems doable. Using workaway.info or /r/wwoof, I'd find a summer position at a place that hopefully hires other young people, and explore the countryside. I'd also be able to visit my friends in the UK. Additionally, a friend may come with me for this trip. Downside? I've already been through Ireland from Dublin to Dingle, and rain isn't my favourite thing.

**Working Holiday, NZ or Aus:** I'd really love to do this. It seems like the perfect blend of beautiful outdoors and opportunities to make friends, as it is a hotspot for English-speaking backpackers. Downside? It's winter there over the summer, and I'm worried that I'll freeze. Leaning towards New Zealand, but apparently it's even colder there.

No hotels, just camping on the beach.  Bringing a small tent, small hammock, solar phone charger (just in case of emergency), multitool, sunscreen and bugspray, a map, plus clothing and whatnot.  I imagine I can buy food and water as needed since I'll be near civilization most of the time.

Transportation plan is to land in San Juan, take a cab to Fahardo, then take the ferry to Vieques and camp there for about week.

Any suggestions on gear/places to check out/places to avoid?

I already have my ticket to Iceland - from there I'm flying to Norway, and then the Balkans. I intend to sleep in a tent the entire time.

I'm most worried about the Iceland leg of the trip - I've read that there are really high winds and I want to ensure I get the right gear.

I've already decided I'll probably get a ~65L backpack, probably an Osprey. 

Any recommendations for a tent? I need to buy all new gear, but I'm on a budget - I was thinking something like the Half Dome 2 might work (http://www.rei.com/product/845478/rei-half-dome-2-tent). Also any insight on a sleeping bag might be nice.
