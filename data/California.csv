&gt;Dear beefanator0:
 
&gt;Thank you for writing to express your opposition to the ""Cybersecurity &gt;Act of 2012"" (S. 2105).  I appreciate your taking the time to write and &gt;welcome the opportunity to share my perspective.
 
&gt;On February 14, 2012, Senator Joseph Lieberman (I-CT) introduced, and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), Senator John Rockefeller (D-WV) and I cosponsored, the ""Cybersecurity Act of 2012"" (S. 2105).  This bill would, among other things, help secure the computer systems that control our most critical infrastructure.  Under the bill, ""critical infrastructure"" is defined narrowly to include systems that if attacked would cause mass casualties, major evacuations, the collapse of financial markets, or degradation of national security.  In addition, the bill would call on the Secretary of Homeland Security to work with private sector operators of critical infrastructure systems to develop cyber security performance requirements.  On February 16, 2012, the bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs for consideration. 
 
&gt;Please note that the bill does not attempt to regulate the Internet and it does not contain a ""kill switch."" 
 
&gt;I am deeply concerned by the significant and growing threat cyber intrusion poses to our national security, our economy, and to individuals' personal information and finances.  American financial institutions have experienced multi-million dollar losses due to cyber thefts.  Even cyber security companies and national security agencies like the FBI and the Department of Defense have fallen victim to cyber attacks.  Finally, cyber attackers hack into individuals' computers, accessing private information, and using the computers to launch other attacks.  These cyber intrusions affect the United States in substantial and real ways, and the threat is only growing. 
 
&gt;As legislation is drafted to address these concerns, it will need to consider the appropriate roles, authorities, and limitations on government and the private sector in protecting computer networks and critical infrastructure, and we worked closely with privacy and civil liberty groups as the legislation was developed.  I strongly believe, however, that improved security must balance the privacy and the civil liberties of all Americans and remain consistent with applicable law.

She never once has a reference to privacy, which is why the internet is upset about it, really. I'm glad I voted against her and Boxer.

Here's a [directory of US representatives](http://www.house.gov/representatives/) (Click on their name to go to their website and email them. Or you can call them.)- and if you aren't sure who is representing your area in the House, you can find out [here](http://www.house.gov/representatives/). 

I encourage you to [contact](http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm?State=CA) our senators (senatrices?) before it gets to the Senate and urge them to vote against CISPA when it comes up for a vote.

And here's how we voted in the House. There may be mistakes, so double check.

Prop 31 – California Government Performance and Accountability – Not real reform, proposed by special interest group, poorly written and takes money from education – It also wants taxes to pay for experimental county programs.  My vote – No.  I live in a conservative county and I don’t want them contradiction our liberal state legislature.

Prop 32 – Prohibits Unions from using payroll deductions.  Anti-union – pro PAC.  My vote – No.

Prop 33 – Allows Auto Insurance Companies to reduce premiums for people who have continuous coverage.  Pro Auto Insurance Industry and funded by them.  There is an exception for military but not students or people who just don’t need a car for extended periods of time.  My vote – NO.  Note, this is not like health insurance where it is to everyones advantage to have continuous coverage.

Prop 34 – Abolish death penalty.  I am not anti-death penalty, but I have always read that the appeal process for death row inmates costs taxpayers more money than life in prison.  Plus I have never liked the ever present possibility of executing innocent people.  My vote – Yes.

Prop 35 – Anti human trafficking.  Not funded – Has broad definition of pimping.  For example the law would define Commercial Sex Acts as “any sexual conduct on account of which anything of value is given or received by any person.”  Another quote from the voter’s guide, “It has a broad definition of pimping that which includes:  parents, children, roommates, domestic partners, and landlords of prostitutes to be labeled as sex offenders.  The real goal is to gain access to asset forfeiture to benefit the endorsing law enforcement agencies and non-profits.  Proposition 35 has no oversight or accountability. This will open the door to corrupt practices we’ve seen before in drug enforcement.”   I don’t like this one – My vote – NO

Prop 36 – Liberalizes Three Strikes law if third felony is not serious or violent – I have always thought that the three strikes law was too restrictive – My vote – YES (corrected) – But I could be convinced otherwise.

Prop 37 – Genetically engineered food labeling.  Why not? – Why doesn’t the food industry want us to know?  My vote – Yes

Prop 38 – Increases everyone’s Personal Income Tax, but does not stop automatic cuts in education.  I think that the increased sales tax proposed under Prop 30, would cost me less than this proposed increase in my Personal Income Tax.  I think I like Prop 30 better.  Note:  If both Prop 30 and 38 pass the one with the highest yes votes wins.  My vote – NO

Prop 39 – Tax corporations based on the California sales – seems like a no brainer and brings in more revenue for California.  My vote – Yes

Prop 40 - Nullify the California State Senate redistricting plan approved by the California Citizens Redistricting Commission.  Courts have already done this.  Is there still a reason to vote on it?

[x-Post from r/ELI5],nyx007,94,23,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/California/comments/1527vw/would_california_be_more_successful_as_an/,"It has long been rumored that California wants to separate and become an independent state. California as its own country would have one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world at only 4%. This would make it very attractive for outside investment.


California currently is the eighth largest economy in the world on its own. 17 of the top 30 U.S. tech companies are in California. Tourism, entertainment, biomedicine, and agriculture are multibillion dollar industries already.


California, as a state, would no longer have to share expenses for a $700 Billion in defense budget. Some analysts say that the European style of government in California would help the economy more than hurt it.

At its peak it was the 5th largest economy in the world, and is now hovering around 8th or 9th. The state could be an economic superpower, especially if there was an export tariff for all of California's products (movies, wine, and porn come to mind, as well as many others).

Gay marriage could be considered 100% legal if California was under its own federal control. The legalization of marijuana would be almost instant, as well as the pardoning of everyone convicted for possession. 

I'm not an economist, but I have a theory stating that if tax rates stayed the same as they did on a national level, the citizens of CA would be paying the same, but reaping benefits better as California is neither as large nor as populous as the entire United States.

This is a truly grassroots campaign to legalize cannabis-hemp-marijuana.
Everybody can volunteer in their own way, word of mouth and educated support are a must! :)
Our goal is to break 1 million signatures.

PETITION CIRCULATION:
We are asking those of voting age in California to help our signature petition to place the initiative on the ballot for the 2014 elections. Each slate of signatures is for 250 valid and registered voters.

PRINT &amp; PUBLISHING:
Information and materials to be distributed during the petition drive are a must. Posters, flyers, gloss cards, and banners will be utilized for recognition and information. Although homemade works, a professional touch works better in the corner of your local shops.

GRAPHIC and VIDEO ARTISTS:
We are currently preparing a program for internet broadcast and to compliment the existing materials for public dissemination.

She's never been one to completely disappear like this. I last physically saw her in April. And I last had any communication with her at all in August- when she sent me a text message with a picture of a rash she had (and I'm certain it was in fact her). She also mentioned being really depressed and needing to see a doctor, but she didn't have insurance or the means to do so. I told her I would give her money to see an urgent care doctor for her rash, but she refused. Then I told her that I wanted to hear from her the following day so she could tell me how it went at urgent care. I tried getting into contact with her the next day to find out if she did in fact go to urgent care for her rash, but I got no response. 

I have gotten no response since, and now her phone has been disconnected. She hasn't been on Facebook or MySpace or anything else for that matter. She's an adult, she's 26; originally from Corona, CA. She first left home in February, but she kept in weekly contact with me via text message. She wouldn't tell me exactly where she was living, but she made reference to the San Diego, CA area. She just told me that she was staying with a friend. Since then, I'm not sure if she has moved or even if she has a place to stay or if she has a job. She graduated from a 6 week nursing course before she left home in January (but I'm not sure of what her certification was). I have contacted ALL of her friends that she may have talked to, but nobody has heard anything at all in over 2 months. Her little 5 year old daughter hasn't seen her mom in months. I filed a police report, and she IS in the missing persons database, but I just want to know that she's okay and I was hoping I could ask everyone to just take one moment to look at her photos. My sister and I haven't been ""close"" (meaning 'best friend' type relationship) since we were kids, but we've always checked in with each other to shoot the shit and make sure the other is doing alright. I have scoured the internets looking for her. I know that sometimes people do this kind of thing because they feel it's what they need. But, why did she all of a sudden cease all contact 2 months ago..? I just want to know that she's okay; that she's alive; that she's not in danger. Please reddit, this isn't a bullshit request; I just want to know that my sis is okay.

tl;dr My 26 year old sister disappeared off of the face of the planet. Do you recognize her? Please tell me that she's okay.




Edit: For those that would be more comfortable speaking to a police officer, here is the business card with the case number that I was given at the time I filed the report. Thank you all again for all of your suggestions and support. http://i.imgur.com/ioK8k.gif

i really appreciate everyone’s prayers and efforts to put the word out to find my sister. i spoke with a detective at the Corona police department, and he said that he spoke with jennifer and she is alive. he informed her of her statUs as a missing person. jennifer said that she would be in contact with me… she hasn’t.. as frustrated and hurt as i am regarding this whole situatioN, i believe that it is indeed her choice to act this way, no matter how selfish, foolish, and inconsiderate it is. she has completely changed her lifestyle, and at this time wants nothing to do with her former life.. while i can say that i've been able to find out a lot about her activities and whereabouts, she's not in a ""safe"" place so to speak, but she is making a conscious decision to live this way.. it would have been nice of her to at least say a simple fuck you so as to leave nobody worried about her whereabouts, but she didn’t. now at least we know. and that being said, i respect her choice to live that way, even if it means abandoning her beloved daughter. again, Thank you all for spreading the word about my sister, your words of kindness, and for understanding that the reasons i had to be alarmed were legitimate.. may the flying spaghetti monster be with you all. :o)",,False,self,t5_2qhsz,True,,,True,t3_lshgg,http://www.reddit.com/r/California/comments/lshgg/reddit_my_sister_disappeared_have_you_seen_her/,

I recently went on a road trip, much fun was had... but.  I lost my favourite wool sweater.  The most painful part is, I know exactly where the sweater dwells at this very moment.

This is where you come in.  Perhaps you would be willing to get it, and mail it to me?  I'd pay the mailing fee, and if you send me a return address I'll even send you a lovely thank you letter!

So where exactly is this sweater of mine?  I'll tell you.  If you head West out of Lompoc along West ocean Ave (HWY 246) and continue along Lassale Canyon Rd, you will eventually come to Ocean Park Rd, take a right!

At this point you should be going into Ocean Beach Park, if you find yourself going around a left handed bend and see a train station - you've gone too far.

This is where it gets a bit tricky.  You will come to a set of railway tracks - DO NOT CROSS THEM! - Instead, continue straight (if you don't have 4wd you may want to get out and walk) You will start along what looks like an old service road.  Continue down this road.

You are almost there my valiant hero.  You should see a point where the road gets too over grown to continue.  This is where I chose to make camp.  This is where my sweater now lies.

You will see it to your left - Possibly hanging from the old decrepite fence - but more likely fallen, blown by the wind, now on the ground.

The sweater is Grey wool, and may try to blend in, but I assure you, this is where my sweater now dwells.  Please my champion!  If you choose to accept this quest, and succeed - my gratitude will be unwavering.

We are a group of California lawyers, debaters, students, activists and young professionals that hope to use the power of debate and direct democracy to establish a new political party in our state.

Who we are:

California Pirate Party is a new political party in California that represents information freedom, digital rights, solutions for economic equality, secular transparent government and civil rights.

Our goal is to register 104,000 California citizens to be members of the California Pirate Party and/or collect 1,000,000 petition signatures to qualify the California Pirate Party to run candidates for elected office in California starting in 2013.

California Pirate Party is a 527 Political Organization and has complied with all requirements of California Elections Code to campaign to register the Pirate Party as a qualified political party in California.


What we believe:

Pirate parties support civil rights, direct democracy and participation, reform of copyright and patent law, free sharing of knowledge, data privacy, transparency, freedom of information, free education, policy solutions to economic inequality, universal healthcare and a clear separation between church and state.

We believe the internet has given rise to a new set of rights that demand a passionate advocate. We believe in universal unrestricted access to the internet. We believe individuals have a right to access information and a right to communicate anonymously.

California Pirate Party believes in secular transparent government and policies that are proportional, fair and based on solid evidence. We believe that open communication and debate will allow the 99% to take control of American politics and develop policies that create a better future.

We believe that California faces unique obstacles and local issues. The California Pirate Party begins with community outreach and a commitment to confronting problems in our state. Specifically, with regards to California law, the Pirate Party is concerned about water politics, police procedure, student debt/education, immigration policy, ocean health and other forms of ecological protection.


What we do:

Our main purpose is to promote public debate, direct democracy and civic participation. We believe that fun can be revolutionary. Creating a culture that enjoys and pursues public intellectualism can make a radical use of American Democracy.

California Pirate Party will host a series of debates in public spaces. We will occupy parks, beaches, public squares and sidewalks to have credible and serious debates about policy and philosophy.

California Pirate Party will promote public debates at universities and educational institutions throughout the state. We are open to debate anyone of any political affiliation on virtually any argument.

California Pirate Party will host Pirate Rallies for interested pirates to come share speeches, art and music. An open stage will be provided for public expression of all kinds.

California Pirate Party hopes to sponsor concerts that feature a variety of artists that support copyright reform.

California Pirate Party will regularly update our website with videos and pictures from our public events. We will use our website to promote a digital form of direct democracy. The policies of the Pirate Party, as well as the rules that govern our organization, will be subject to public review, debate and edit. The people are the captains of the California Pirate Party, and will have control over its ultimate direction.

California Pirate Party will offer support to activists that are working to make the world more fair. This involves a variety of resources that are currently being developed.


How can you be involved:

We would love to get any support from Reddit as possible. Reddit is, after all, the front page of the internet. It will be very helpful to use sub-reddits to coordinate public events and meeting times. In addition to being beautiful, these are other things you can do:

Check out our [website](http://www.calpirateparty.org) and participate in the debate. It will continue to be updated as we start to gather signatures, gather merchandise and produce more original content.

Register to become a member of the California Pirate Party if you are a California Citizen that is registered to vote in the state. This can be done through the website or at our public events.

Attend a California Pirate Party public debate, rally or concert. These will be incredibly fun and an opportunity to dress up like pirates.

Contribute art, speeches, or arguments to the website or public debate project. We would love to hear your perspective on any issue.

Donate to the Pirate Party so that we can continue doing something radically different, educational and entertaining. These are the ingredients for a potion that may cure a plague of apathy and promote an arm of political influence that defends the 99%.

Please, if you are interested, reach out. We are very excited, and hope to conduct our first public debate in the first week of June!

1351380969.0,38,self.California,12718l,Can anyone answer these questions about Prop 35 (Human Sex Trafficking)? I'm trying to make an informed vote.,AccountCreated4This,44,6,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/California/comments/12718l/can_anyone_answer_these_questions_about_prop_35/,"[Link to Ballotpedia on Prop 35](http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_35,_Ban_on_Human_Trafficking_and_Sex_Slavery_%282012%29)

1) It's said that Prop 35 will broaden the definition of trafficking to ""include the production or distribution of child pornography."" I did not see this in the proposition language itself unless it is a tangential reference to a pre-existing penal code statute referenced only by number. Can someone point to me where in the proposition language this would be?

This concerns me because I think we should use the tools we have to exact justice and not try to rope people in under duplicate or unrelated laws. Like if someone has a CP image of a child for sale for sex trafficking (buy this kid, or whatever), and then that image gets loose on the internet and some random pedo saves it to his hard drive not knowing the origins or purpose, then later gets caught for his CP - I want that person prosecuted for having CP under all applicable CP laws, but that person does not seem to be involved at all in sex trafficking other than in the most tangential way. It seems like it would be hard to draw a line, so would all CP now be ""sex trafficking""? I just want to see proper justice administered and not just label everything ""sex trafficking,"" which will only diminish the meaning of when REAL sex trafficking occurs.

2) The erotic service providers claim that if they're somehow roped into this and labelled traffickers, anyone they gave money to, like say, their children for college, could also be tried as a trafficker. Where is the language in the proposition that would allow that to happen? Are erotic service providers really at risk for being roped in as traffickers under this proposition? I just don't see it in the changes to the penal code, but maybe I'm missing something.

3) The whole idea of now requiring EVERYONE on the sex offender registry, and not just sex traffickers, to register their ISP info and all online contact and alias information (like reddit user names) and turn that over to the local authorities who then turn it over to the DOJ (I believe that was the federal agency named). What purpose does this serve that isn't already met by pre-existing laws and court orders? Is there any legit evidence that sex offenders who get put on the registry then try to use the internet to perpetrate further sex crimes? I would also assume that if the original sex crime had internet involvement, a condition of release/parole/probation/whatever would either be to stay off the internet or possibly surrender your internet info to the authorities if you're going to use the internet. Is there any evidence that these people are re-offending and possibly breaking the terms of their probation by attempting to commit more sex crimes via the internet to the degree that ALL sex offenders should now have to register?

Don't get me wrong - I'm not into protecting sex offenders anymore than a civilized society should under our Constitution, but there are some ridiculous things that qualify people for CA's sex offender registry. On top of that I don't trust what the government is going to do with their internet information. And on top of that, I think there is a big possibility of mis-identification on both ends. Say someone turns over the forum name ""CarLover100"" for their AOL screen name, and then some parole officer sees someone else named ""CarLover100"" on reddit - are they then going to hassle the sex offender about whether that is an online alias of his he failed to report? Are they going to subpoena info on the unrelated user of that login? What is the point to any of this? It seems like a monumental waste of time in a world where everyone uses the internet, instead of focusing on those already sex offenders known to use the internet to commit sex crimes, or focusing on those people using the internet for sex crimes that haven't been caught yet.

Thank you for any assistance you can provide me in answering my questions.

**EDIT:**

After not getting any helpful replies (not blaming anyone for that), and being a bit bored, I took the time to dive into this stuff yet again.

Here is what I found and the conclusions I reached. Maybe it will be of help to people to understand this proposition a little better, provided I'm not too far off the mark on these points:

As I guessed up above, many of the main opposition points for things like CP and liability for the erotic services industry come from penal code sections enumerated within the sex slave trafficking section. All of the old sections carry over from the current language, with new sections added. I've noted the new sections as such:

* 266 – Prostitution of minor females
* 266h – People who derive money from prostitution
* 266i – Pimping/pandering
* NEW 266j – Giving or transporting a child for any lewd or lascivious act
* 267 – Taking away a child from a legal guardian for prostitution
* NEW 311.1 – Child porn
* NEW 311.2 – Any obscene matter
* NEW 311.3 – Sexual exploitation aka pictures of children engaged in sexual acts
* 311.4 – Hiring a minor for obscene matter, sexual conduct media for commercial and non-commercial purposes
* NEW 311.5 – Writing/promoting obscene material
* NEW 311.6 – Promotion of obscene live events
* 518 – Extortion

Old Penalty:

* Adult - imprisonment in the state prison for three, four, or five years.

* Minor - imprisonment in the state prison for four, six, or eight years.

New Penalty:

* Adults - imprisonment in the state prison for 8, 14, or 20 years and a fine of not more than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).

* Minors - imprisonment in the state prison as follows:
(1) Five, 8, or 12 years and a fine of not more than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).
(2) Fifteen years to life and a fine of not more than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) when the offense involves force, fear, fraud, deceit, coercion, violence, duress, menace, or threat of unlawful injury to the victim or to another person.

The current law basically included general human trafficking and sex slave trafficking in the same subsection. The revision breaks human trafficking into two parts – one for general human trafficking (I would assume something like classic slave work – perhaps farm workers or even some of those horror nanny stories you hear about). The second part is for the sex slave trade. As you can see above, the current law already included all of the things that the erotic services industry is complaining about - so I'm calling BS on their points because with 6 people in prison for trafficking, obviously they're not going after the erotic services industry with this stuff which has been on the books for a long time. The revision basically adds child porn stuff – and that makes sense to me. No doubt in the internet age, there have to be some scummy services that send you child porn that is of the sex slave you’d eventually get or spend time with or whatever. That kind of stuff definitely keeps the sex trade going.

For all of those sections, you also have to meet the requirement of “Any person who deprives or violates the personal liberty of another with the intent to effect or maintain a violation of . . .” There are a few more related words added to the definitions of “deprivation or violation of personal liberty” and “duress,” but otherwise it’s the same stuff. So that alleviates my concern about CP criminals having unnecessary laws thrown at them. If someone has CP of a kid involved in the sex trade, the prosecutor will have to prove the person with the CP obtained it in furtherance of the sex slave industry, and not just because its CP in general. Otherwise, if its just someone with CP, they're just prosecuted for CP like normal.

The penalty for minors is a little confusing because by definition of “deprivation of personal liberty,” human trafficking and sex slaves involve force, fear, etc. That’s the one area of the trafficking portions that seems to be poorly written and/or implemented.

The consent and mistake of age seem like they’re pretty common bar’s to defenses of sexual misconduct in criminal law. In California “She said she was 18” isn't a valid defense for statutory rape if she was 14 or younger (otherwise I guess mistake of fact MIGHT work as a defense if she was 15-17). This is obviously broader. Might an erotic services industry accidentally employ an underage girl? Yes. But for them to get hit with these trafficking laws, the prosecution is going to have to prove a whole lot more. The fear by them seems unjustified, and again, they've already been subject to the current law.

I support the changes to the evidence code too, but whether or not they’ll be Constitutional when all is said and done is another story.

I really have to wonder how many individuals or newspapers went into that kind of detail to really look at the law, or if they just read the analysis and based their opinions off that.

I still stand by the idea that requiring all sex offenders to register their internet information is a little absurd. Had that part not been present, I probably would have voted YES for these changes. The old law obviously wasn’t the problem for prosecuting human traffickers, so in that sense this is somewhat of a “scare tactic” and you could say these changes are better left to the legislature than to the proposition system. I just don’t support the requirements for sex offenders to register their internet information. I think that, plus the fact these reforms should be able to be passed legislatively and not by proposition, means I’ll lean toward NO on this proposition.

**tl;dr - The erotic services industry seems to be full of it with their opposition to this as they are already subject to the current law, which isn't a whole lot different, penalties aside. However this is something that should normally be done legislatively. Additionally, there doesn't appear to be good reason to require EACH AND EVERY sex offender to register their internet information with the government. This has me personally leaning toward a NO vote.**",,False,self,t5_2qhsz,1351414813.0,,,True,t3_12718l,http://www.reddit.com/r/California/comments/12718l/can_anyone_answer_these_questions_about_prop_35/,

I found a guide handbook for tenants and landlords for the state of California. My girlfiend has been renting a room from a man and lady for a month and today she was told that she must move out ASAP. They told her that she has come home too late and they don't like it that she has a friend in her room (me)(I've never been in there for longer than 3 hours during the day/evening). The catch? There was no warning. No rules written on the contract. They will give her the rest of the months pay and deposit back but want her out today. Is this legal? I have read that she should get either (a) three days written notice if she has done illegal activity. She hasn't. Or (b) 30 day written notice to evict. 

This is from the handbook: However, in the case of a single lodger in a house where there are no other lodgers, the owner can evict the lodger without using formal eviction proceedings.

She is a single lodger. Is this saying that a single lodger (tenant renting a room from a home owner) can be kicked out any time?? Why? Please help.


Edit:
Also who can we contact if we want to takes some sort of action? Police?



*** ok thanks guys for your help. I know now that rules change by city. Also that a 30 days should be required. Thanks for all your help.


Update!! So she found another room. We made sure to know the rules of the house. She won't be able to move into the new room until tomorrow so she went back to the current room and they told she can't stay. They said by her packing her things that was taken as an agreement? That she is leaving. This kinda stumped me. Whatever. She is staying one night at my house. Thanks for all you input.

I need some local help with a small project and I thank you in advance for considering it!

(mods, if this is not an acceptable post for this subreddit I'm sorry, just feel free to delete it)

I've been with my girlfriend for almost 10 years now, but we've been apart for the last 5 as I've been enrolled in a PhD program in a different country. I'm finally finishing writing up my thesis and should be done in about a month and an half. I want to tell her I'm coming home in a special way. 

I would like for her to receive a postcard from all the places we've visited together these past years. Each postcard would have just one letter in it, nothing more. Together they would spell an url where there would be a message from me telling her that I'm going home to her. 

I already enlisted [/r/England](http://www.reddit.com/r/england/comments/1i2wph/hi_rengland_i_would_like_to_ask_your_help_with_a/) and [/r/Unitedkingdom](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1i31ry/hi_runitedkingdom_i_would_like_to_ask_your_help/). Going through the different regions where I need postcards from while trying to avoid reddit spam filter for multiposting. 

While I would like to repay for the postcard and the stamp, I reckon it would probably be really costly and troublesome to arrange for a bank transfer so I'll gladly offer a month of reddit gold as a token of gratitude for both the time and money spent with this.

We've travelled quite a bit over the years so if you happen to be in any of these other cities and would be up to give me a hand I would be really thankful.

Cheers

He wants to live in San Francisco, I want to live in Sacramento, near my Uncle. My Uncle told me that we should look at living in a place like Dixon before moving to a big city of California. 

My Uncle has talked about my SO and I coming to California to visit him and my Aunt first before we make our final decision and to do a little research about living expenses, insurance, and other things. So i guess my question for you redditors would be, What's it like?

Do you love living in California? Have you lived there all your life? For those of you who moved into the state, why did you? What made you chose California? Where in California do you live? 

There are just too many questions to list out. But if any of you could inform me of what living in California is like, what you like about it, what you don't like about it. The ups and the downs. I would really appreciate it. And maybe you california redditors will be adding two more to your community in the near future!

HUGE California Traffic Tickets Fines Effective 01/06/2011 
 
Please be extremely careful in your driving and car registration &amp; insurance matters.  State of California is broke and they are trying hard to squeeze all of us hard to collect money.  

Effective immediately, if you do not stop at the red light, be ready to pay $436 in fines or if you pass a school bus with flashing red signals, you will be charged $616.  The state of California is going for blood, so be extra careful in driving, You cannot afford messing with them.  I have been hearing that Highway Patrols are under pressure to issue a lot more tickets than last year with at least 30% increase in fines over 2009, so beware of radar guns, highway and traffic cameras installed everywhere and the tougher enforcement of parking rules. 
Just for your info, the next time you park in the handicapped zone, even for a minute, you will be looking at almost $ 1000 in parking tickets , so it'd better be worth it. 
 
California needs money, so pay close attention to the rules of the road!

I'm from Central Europe and I'll attend a summer school in Salt Lake City in july. I figured I might as well stay in the states (never been before but always wanted) to see some places.  

I'm pretty sure that I don't want to spend my time in Utah (I don't have a car and I won't be able to rent one) so I'll probably fly to San Francisco as my first step.  
Apparently Highway #1 is nice and I kinda want to see LA as well. I don't mind staying in the Bay Area though.

Also, I love to play Ultimate (which I get plenty of in Europe) and Discgolf (which basically doesn't exist in Europe...) - a discgolf tour would be a cool extra (I might repost to /r/discgolf)

So...I have some time at my hands and I can do whatever I want (travelling alone on purpose!)

1374166945.0,27,self.California,1ikih4,Dianne Feinstein's response to an email regarding the NSA,parineum,33,6,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/California/comments/1ikih4/dianne_feinsteins_response_to_an_email_regarding/,"I sent Dianne Feinstein an email some time ago regarding the NSA. I'm not sure when, nor do I really remember what was said since it's been so long since I sent the email. It doesn't matter though since the response is a boilerplate reply.

&gt;I received your communication indicating your concerns about the two National Security Agency programs that have been in the news recently.   I appreciate that you took the time to write on this important issue and welcome the opportunity to respond. 

 

&gt;First, I understand your concerns and want to point out that by law, the government cannot listen to an American's telephone calls or read their emails without a court warrant issued upon a showing of probable cause.  As is described in the attachment to this letter provided by the Executive Branch, the programs that were recently disclosed have to do with information about phone calls – the kind of information that you might find on a telephone bill – in one case, and the internet communications (such as email) of non-Americans outside the United States in the other case.  Both programs are subject to checks and balances, and oversight by the Executive Branch, the Congress, and the Judiciary.

 

&gt;As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I can tell you that I believe the oversight we have conducted is strong and effective and I am doing my level best to get more information declassified.  Please know that it is equally frustrating to me, as it is to you, that I cannot provide more detail on the value these programs provide and the strict limitations placed on how this information is used.  I take serious my responsibility to make sure intelligence programs are effective, but I work equally hard to ensure that intelligence activities strictly comply with the Constitution and our laws and protect Americans' privacy rights.

 

&gt;These surveillance programs have proven to be very effective in identifying terrorists, their activities, and those associated with terrorist plots, and in allowing the Intelligence Community and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prevent numerous terrorist attacks.  More information on this should be forthcoming.

 

&gt;* On June 18, 2003, the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) testified to the House Intelligence Committee that there have been ""over 50 potential terrorist events"" that these programs helped prevent. 

 

&gt;* While the specific uses of these surveillance programs remain largely classified, I have reviewed the classified testimony and reports from the Executive Branch that describe in detail how this surveillance has stopped attacks. 

 

&gt;* Two examples where these surveillance programs were used to prevent terrorist attacks were: (1) the attempted bombing of the New York City subway system in September 2009 by Najibullah Zazi and his co-conspirators; and (2) the attempted attack on a Danish newspaper that published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in October 2009 by U.S. citizen David Headley and his associates. 

 

&gt;* Regarding the planned bombing of the New York City subway system, the NSA has determined that in early September of 2009, while monitoring the activities of Al Qaeda terrorists in Pakistan, NSA noted contact from an individual in the U.S. that the FBI subsequently identified as Colorado-based Najibullah Zazi.  The U.S. Intelligence Community, including the FBI and NSA, worked in concert to determine his relationship with Al Qaeda, as well as identify any foreign or domestic terrorist links.  The FBI tracked Zazi as he traveled to New York to meet with co-conspirators, where they were planning to conduct a terrorist attack using hydrogen peroxide bombs placed in backpacks. Zazi and his co-conspirators were subsequently arrested. Zazi eventually pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb the NYC subway system. 

 

&gt;* Regarding terrorist David Headley, he was also involved in the planning and reconnaissance of the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India that killed 166 people, including six Americans.  According to NSA, in October 2009, Headley, a Chicago businessman and dual U.S. and Pakistani citizen, was arrested by the FBI as he tried to depart from Chicago O'Hare airport on a trip to Europe.  Headley was charged with material support to terrorism based on his involvement in the planning and reconnaissance of the hotel attack in Mumbai 2008.  At the time of his arrest, Headley and his colleagues were plotting to attack the Danish newspaper that published the unflattering cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, at the behest of Al Qaeda. 

 

&gt;Not only has Congress been briefed on these programs, but laws passed and enacted since 9/11 specifically authorize them.  The surveillance programs are authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which itself was enacted by Congress in 1978 to establish the legal structure to carry out these programs, but also to prevent government abuses, such as surveillance of Americans without approval from the federal courts. The Act authorizes the government to gather communications and other information for foreign intelligence purposes.  It also establishes privacy protections, oversight mechanisms (including court review), and other restrictions to protect privacy rights of Americans. 

 

&gt;The laws that have established and reauthorized these programs since 9/11 have passed by mostly overwhelming margins.  For example, the phone call business record program was reauthorized most recently on May 26, 2011 by a vote of 72-23 in the Senate and 250-153 in the House.  The internet communications program was reauthorized most recently on December 30, 2012 by a vote of 73-22 in the Senate and 301-118 in the House. 

 

&gt;Attached to this letter is a brief summary of the two intelligence surveillance programs that were recently disclosed in media articles.  While I very much regret the disclosure of classified information in a way that will damage our ability to identify and stop terrorist activity, I believe it is important to ensure that the public record now available on these programs is accurate and provided with the proper context.

 

&gt;Again, thank you for contacting me with your concerns and comments.  I appreciate knowing your views and hope you continue to inform me of issues that matter to you.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact my office in Washington, D.C. at (202) 224-3841.

Thank you for contacting me to express your opposition to the ""Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act,"" commonly known as the ""PROTECT IP Act."" 

 

The ""PROTECT IP Act"" (S. 968) gives copyright and trademark owners and the U.S. Department of Justice authority to take action against websites ""dedicated to infringing activities.""  These are websites that have ""no significant use other than engaging in, enabling, or facilitating"" copyright infringement, the sale of goods with a counterfeit trademark, or the evasion of technological measures designed to protect against copying.  I'm sorry to say that theft of intellectual property is a major problem and has primarily adversely affected the American motion picture industry. 

 

I voted for the ""PROTECT IP Act"" when it came before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but I always had reservations about several aspects of the bill. 

 

First, I oppose censorship and am working to make sure the bill protects First Amendment rights to free speech.  In addition, as far back as 2010, I raised concerns about the website blocking provision.  I was pleased Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) announced this provision would be removed from the bill.  I was also concerned that the overbroad language of the bill could encompass non-pirate websites and filed an amendment to fix this problem.  Finally, I worked to alleviate undue burdens on Internet advertising services and to minimize the risk of litigation on growing technology businesses.

 

On May 26, 2011, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the ""PROTECT IP Act"" by voice vote for consideration by the full Senate.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) announced on January 20, 2012, that he was postponing a procedural vote on this bill.  I believe postponing this vote was the right thing to do.  In order to move forward, the bill must be changed to prevent it from harming legitimate businesses and Internet users in the process of protecting copyrights and trademarks.  In other words, the bill must be fair and balanced.

 

In mid-January, I convened a meeting in San Francisco with Google, Yahoo! and Facebook to hear valid concerns of high-tech businesses and public interest groups.  I have spoken again with leaders at Google about a path forward on this bill.  My goal is to do everything I can to bring all sides together – including copyright owners, high-tech and my colleagues – to produce a fair and balanced bill. 

 

As you may be aware, Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) has introduced the ""Stop Online Piracy Act"" (H.R. 3261), which is similar to the ""PROTECT IP Act"", in the House of Representatives.  Please know I will keep your thoughts in mind should the Senate proceed to a vote on either of these bills. 

 

Once again, thank you for sharing your views.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact my Washington, D.C. office at (202) 224-3841.  


          Wishing you a happy 2012.

Sincerely yours,


  Dianne Feinstein
         United States Senator

I wanna hear the good the bad, and the dirt nasty talk of these people. Please provide as much evidence to your claims as possible. Who are you voting for and why?

Edit: Good touch on adding the Props to the discussion as well. I have my own opinion on what I'm voting for this upcoming November, but I don't know many people who like to speak about politics so Thank You fellow redditors for for speaking your voice. I believe it's healthy to to view other peoples perspective,  keeps you from becoming a narrow minded person. 

Edit2: I've decided to vote Laura Wells. I believe she is a worthy candidate for California. I at least like her a bit more than Brown, and a lot more than Whitman. She is pro gay marriage, pro regulating Cannabis, pro fair immigration policy, in opposition to laws like Arizona's SB 1070.

Let's discuss them! I've cut and pasted the generic descriptions of each one below:

19: LEGALIZES MARIJUANA UNDER CALIFORNIA BUT NOT FEDERAL LAW. PERMITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REGULATE AND TAX COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION, AND SALE OF MARIJUANA. INITIATIVE STATUTE. - Allows people 21 years old or older to possess, cultivate, or transport marijuana for personal use. Fiscal Impact: Depending on federal, state, and local government actions, potential increased tax and fee revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually and potential correctional savings of several tens of millions of dollars annually.

20: REDISTRICTING OF CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. - Removes elected representatives from process of establishing congressional districts and transfers that authority to recently-authorized 14-member redistricting commission comprised of Democrats, Republicans, and respresentatives of neither party. Fiscal Impact: No significant net change in state redistricting costs.

21: ESTABLISHES $18 ANNUAL VEHICLE LICENSE SURCHARGE TO HELP FUND STATE PARKS AND WILDLIFE PROGRAMS. GRANTS SURCHARGED VEHICLES FREE ADMISSION TO ALL STATE PARKS. INITIATIVE STATUTE. - Exempts commercial vehicles, trailers and trailer coaches from the surcharge. Fiscal Impact: Annual increase to state revenues of $500 million from surcharge on vehicle registrations. After offsetting some existing funding sources, these revenues would provide at least $250 million more annually for state parks and wildlife conservation.


22: PROHIBITS THE STATE FROM BORROWING OR TAKING FUNDS USED FOR TRANSPORTATION, REDEVELOPMENT, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROJECTS AND SERVICES. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. - Prohibits State, even during severe fiscal hardship, from delaying distribution of tax revenues for these purposes. Fiscal Impact: Decreased state General Fund spending and/or increased state revenues, probably in the range of $1 billion to several billions of dollars annually. Comparable increases in funding for state and local transportation programs and local redevelopment.

23: SUSPENDS IMPLEMENTATION OF AIR POLLUTION CONTROL LAW (AB 32) REQUIRING MAJOR SOURCES OF EMISSIONS TO REPORT AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT CAUSE GLOBAL WARMING, UNTIL UNEMPLOYMENT DROPS TO 5.5 PERCENT OR LESS FOR FULL YEAR. INITIATIVE STATUTE. - Fiscal Impact: Likely modest net increase in overall economic activity in the state from suspension of greenhouse gases regulatory activity, resulting in a potentially significant net increase in state and local revenues.

24: REPEALS RECENT LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW BUSINESSES TO LOWER THEIR TAX LIABILITY. INITIATIVE STATUTE. - Fiscal Impact: Increased state revenues of about $1.3 billion each year by 2012–13 from higher taxes paid by some businesses. Smaller increases in 2010–11 and 2011–12.

25: CHANGES LEGISLATIVE VOTE REQUIREMENT TO PASS BUDGET AND BUDGET-RELATED LEGISLATION FROM TWO-THIRDS TO A SIMPLE MAJORITY. RETAINS TWO-THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT FOR TAXES. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. - Legislature permanently forfeits daily salary and expenses until budget bill passes. Fiscal Impact: In some years, the contents of the state budget could be changed due to the lower legislative vote requirement in this measure. The extent of changes would depend on the Legislature's future actions.

26: REQUIRES THAT CERTAIN STATE AND LOCAL FEES BE APPROVED BY TWO-THIRDS VOTE. FEES INCLUDE THOSE THAT ADDRESS ADVERSE IMPACTS ON SOCIETY OR THE ENVIRONMENT CAUSED BY THE FEE-PAYER'S BUSINESS. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. - Fiscal Impact: Depending on decisions by governing bodies and voters, decreased state and local government revenues and spending (up to billions of dollars annually). Increased transportation spending and state General Fund costs ($1 billion annually).

27: ELIMINATES STATE COMMISSION ON REDISTRICTING. CONSOLIDATES AUTHORITY FOR REDISTRICTING WITH ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AND STATUTE. - Eliminates 14-member redistricting commission. Consolidates authority for establishing state Assembly, Senate, and Board of Equalization districts with elected representatives who draw congressional districts. Fiscal Impact: Possible reduction of state redistricting costs of around $1 million over the next year. Likely reduction of these costs of a few million dollars once every ten years beginning in 2020.

I'll put my initial thoughts in the comments.

It's been in the committee since June of 2011! This is probably because it has been sort of swept under the rug by the committee's chair ""Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX)"" (The person who wrote SOPA. Go figure) Well, the bill is sponsored by Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA) and it already has 20 co-sponsors! 

So do you really want to make a change? Do you really want to make a difference? Call your representatives/senators! Tell them to move forward with this legislation! Let them know that the people who are voting them into office are also the ones who want them to support this bill! We can do this like we did with SOPA and PIPA. It only took a day for that.

(x-posted to r/california, r/losangeles, r/legal)  







GF Information:  







She is a resident of the state of CA; county/city Los Angeles. She is a bartender who has been working for this current employer, for this post ""The Bar,"" for approximately 1 year.















The Bar information/misdeeds:  







- The employees are paid on ""per shift"" basis. Shift pay (at least for my GF, per her paycheck) is $65. Shifts (for night bartenders, which my GF is) are 7p-2a during weekdays, 6p-2a on weekends, however, employees are asked to report to work 30min before the ""start"" of their shift (as ""bar time"" is 15 minutes fast; this allows them to arrive 15 minutes early to change over shift), and employees are required to stay past 2a (bar closing) to close out their register, clean, etc., so a weekend shift can easily be 9 hours or longer which makes $65 below minimum wage.  







- ...continued from above: employees do not clock in/out.  







- ... continued from above: taxes are withheld from my GF's paycheck; she is not an independent contractor; I am not aware of the forms she signed when beginning employment















- Employees are not afforded any meal break. As I understand it, as their shifts are &gt;6hours they are required by law to receive a 1/2 hour (unpaid) meal break after 5 hours of continuous work.  







- ...continued from above: as I understand the law, if you are not given a meal break, your employer is mandated to pay you for 1 hours time at your normal rate (again, there is no ""hourly rate"" on her paycheck, but assuming minimum wage [$8] and assuming she has worked an average of 4 shifts/week for the last 52 weeks, this would entitle her to &gt;$1500)  















- There are NO labor regulations/minimum wage notifications/etc. posted at her place of work, so the employees have no direct access to the information that directly contradicts how they are being treated/paid.  















- Employees are (semi-)regularly required to attend mandatory meetings that are unpaid. These meetings have ranged anywhere from 1hr to 3hrs.  















- The Bar has remained open for the last 4+ weeks despite undergoing renovations to the interior, which has included pulling up wall-to-wall carpet (yes, in a bar) and ""sanding"" the bare concrete beneath.  







- Important to note on above: not only are drinks served (and obviously, liquor bottles out and open) at The Bar, but there is an attached/adjoining cafe that serves food, and food is routinely brought in/sold/consumed in The Bar.  















- Occasionally, during large sporting events, the owner of The Bar will serve food directly in The Bar (hot dogs in a boiler; corn on the cob; etc). I am a bit more ignorant of Food service/FDA policies and how they relate to such businesses, but as I understand it, open food ""bars"" aren't allowed in CA bars/nightclubs.

Need reddit's help with logistics and concerns. PLEASE!(xpost from AskReddit)",tenth,29,6,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/California/comments/jw5a6/im_at_24yearold_thats_been_given_a/,"I need out of my home town. I need to explore while I'm young, and I've been dreaming of the west coast since I was young. A land where weed is legal, the sun is always shining, and the people are extremely varied. I realize it may not be the myth Hollywood presents in films, but I'm still excited to be on the other side of the country.

The basic jist is this--on hearing that a friend had found me a job in Chicago and I was going to make the desperate leap from Louisville to there in less than two weeks my cousin said, ""I thought you were always going to end up in LA or San Diego?"" I pointed out that I had no way to even start there, no one to stay with to even give myself a boost in finding a job. 
""If you need out that bad--I'll sponsor your rent on an apartment for a month or two and gas to get out to CA. But you have to bust your ass finding a job to support yourself, because if you haven't by the end of those two months--then you've not only wasted my time and money, but your own as well.""

So, that's where it's at. I've tentatively set my departure date as the last day in September. What I need from YOU guys is all the information I'm unsure of, or any you want to provide me in addition(things you think I may not be considering).

Opening questions, which may be edited to add more later:

-Prices of several random things: A jar of Peanut Butter, pack of cigarettes, a gallon of gas, a hot dog, a gallon of milk, a meal at an uncostly restaurant?


-Average pay of a job. How tough are jobs to get right now? I have a bachelor's in English, whatever that's worth. How much would one expect to make working fast food, or retail? What kinds of jobs are easy to get, or specific to CA? 


-Nice places to live that aren't too expensive, but still have lots of culture. LA seems just wildly overprices--is there anywhere within an hour or so's drive that would be cheaper, or easier to start in? I only know the areas of the state that are television/film settings--like Orange County, Big Sur, etc. But, is there something not-too-big+not-too-small that would be a better consideration? I don't want to be too isolated, but I don't want to be paying any more than I have to, or for that matter, asking my cousin to foot the bill on a place that's any more expensive than necessary. 


-Things to avoid? Areas of California to avoid in general? My city is small(16th largest in the states, I believe), and it's easy to avoid the bad area of town. I know that I won't have that same radar for avoiding trouble in a new city and state. Any advice with that?


-Weird laws, regulations, etc. I should be aware of in the move? Things I wouldn't think about having been a KY resident my whole life?


-How do I go about getting legal residence once I'm there? How do I transfer all of my information after I've been out there a bit? I know I'd need a new driver's license, but beyond that I have no idea what's required with this kind of cross-country move. 


-Is this even possible or am I reaching for stars? Is it economically feasible right now, or is our country's economy too fucked?

**EDIT:** Okay, I guess my best bet for heading west is Colorado. Looking at places near Boulder or Ft. Collins now, so I guess this sub-reddit is no longer the appropriate place for discussion.
