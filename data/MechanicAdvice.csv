1341232655.0,116,self.MechanicAdvice,vx6k2,How to speak without confusing your mechanic,tehdon,129,13,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/vx6k2/how_to_speak_without_confusing_your_mechanic/,"I've been lurking and occasionally posting for a bit now, and it seems that a lot of confusion occurs when people who don't know the car repair lingo try to explain the problem that they are having.  I'm going to try to create a fairly well formatted post in an attempt to clarify things.  Hopefully it will be helpful, or at least entertaining.  
  
**Identify your vehicle**  
The *minimum* information that you should relay to us is the year, make, model, engine size, relevant options.  You will have to use your best judgement on what options are relevant.  Remember, it's always better to provide too much vehicle information than not enough.  Options that are helpful to know are transmission type (auto, manual), 4x4 vs 2x4, any aftermarket tomfoolery, modifications to the electronics, and any recent work that has been done.  Again, having too much information is much better than not having enough.  
  
**Vehicle won't start**  
  
* If the starter spins the engine with sufficient speed that the engine should start, but doesn't, you should say ""The vehicle cranks, but doesn't start""  
* If the starter spins the engine with sufficient speed that the engine should start, it does start, but immediately dies, you should say ""The vehicle cranks and starts, but won't run""  
* If the starter spins the engine, but it spins the engine too slowly to actually start the engine, you should say ""The engine cranks slowly and does not start""  
* If the starter does not spin the engine, you should say ""The engine does not crank""  
  
**Noises**  
  
When your vehicle makes odd noises try to tell us as much as possible about not only the noise, but also about what is going on in the environment around the vehicle, what the vehicle itself is doing, and what options are turned on.  Try to classify the noise that it's making, rather than just saying ""it's making noise.""
  
* Squeaks and Squeals: Usually a shrill, high pitched noise.  [Here's a Dayco video talking about squeals vs chirps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUnftyDpfv4&amp;feature=related) and [here's a video with some brake squealing in it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxdE12B8QXM&amp;feature=related)  Tell us where the noise is coming from and when you hear it.  Examples: ""The brakes squeak when I brake at low speeds,"" ""the belt on the front of my engine squeaks all the time,"" ""my belt on the front of my engine squeaks when the A/C is on, but only when it's raining out.""  As always, more information is good.  
* Grinding nosies:  That noise you hear when metal is rubbing against metal.  I've heard it described a plethora of ways.  Once you've heard it you will be able to identify it everywhere.  Tell us when and where you hear it.  If it's coming from your brakes then STOP DRIVING THAT CAR until you find out where it's coming from.  
* Clunking and thumping:  Clunking noises in the suspension sound like someone tapping a part with a hammer.  Sometimes it sounds like they are tapping it gently, and sometimes it sounds like they aren't being very gentle at all.  Tell us everything you can about the noise, is it only over bumps?  Etc.
  
**Driveability**  
  
This is the part that I'm sure people will disagree with me on, at least to some extent.  
* If the vehicle seems to be running fine, but doesn't have the power that it used to have, say just that.  Don't forget to tell us and recent events that make you expect that it is operating at reduced power.  
* If the vehicle is jerking, shuddering, spasming, or the engine is bouncing around like a [cat in an automatic catwash](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyi8ly5dRkU) then tell us when it happens.  Is it only when you're going up a steep hill?  At night with the headlights on?  In traffic?  In the rain?  All of this information helps us figure out whats up.  
* If the vehicle starts, runs for a bit, and then dies, for the love of FSM don't say it ""won't turn over.""  Tell us it starts, and then dies.  Then tell us how it dies.  Does it idle for a couple seconds then die?  Can you feather the accelerator and keep it running?  Does it die when you put it in gear?  Information is key.  
  
**The Check Engine Lamp**  
  
We need to know why this light is on, not that it is in fact on.  The check engine lamp is an indicator that says ""SOMETHING IS WRONG!""  If you vehicle is a 1996 or newer vehicle than you can go to almost any autoparts store and they can scan your computer and tell you the codes that are present.  When they do that, have them clear the codes, drive the vehicle until the light comes back on, and have them read again, and tell us all of the original codes and the codes that came back.  The codes will be in a very specific format, such are ""p0300 Random cylinder misfire"" or ""p0305 Cylinder 5 misfire"" or ""p0420 Catalytic converter efficiency below threshold.""  
  
**tl;dr**  
  
Just take it to a mechanic and tell us what he told you, preferably with a pic of the estimate.

* Check your lights. Brake lights, tag lights, reverse lights, you get the idea.

Underhood:

*  With the engine cold take off your radiator cap and check the fluid level. If it's nasty in there go ahead and flush out your cooling system. Top off as necessary.

*  Check brake fluid level, if it is low, you have a hint you may be low on brake pad thickness.

* Use a flash light and inspect your drive belts for cracks. If it is cracked, it is usually obvious. Replace cracked belts.

* Look around for oil leaking near your valve cover(s). If you see leaks a valve cover gasket is an easy, enjoyable fix for cheap. (If you own a GM with a 3100, 3400, 3600, 3800 look in the valey on both ends of the motor for coolant leaking. They leak all the time from the intake gaskets)

* Check your power steering reservoir. If the fluid is low, look for leaks near the pump or lines (we will look at the rack later)

* Check trans fluid, if it is dark considering getting a trans flush or dropping the pan and doing it your self. (Some will say to be careful with changing fluid on older transmissions. So do some research before you dive into this with a high mileage vehicle)

* Pull off your PCV valve and shake it. it should rattle a little. If it doesn't make any noise, replace it.

* Check your air filter and if you are feeling so inclined pull of the tubing to the throttlebody and peak into the intake. If it's nasty try some seafoam treatment to clean up the gunk.

* Inspect your battery terminals for corrosion. This is cleaned with a baking soda water mixture. Then rinse off with more water. There is a special paint that can be sprayed on the terminals to protect from future corrosion if that interests you.

* Using a flashlight look for any motor mounts on the upper part of the engine bay. Check for tearing and replace any that are torn through or almost torn through. as soon as one mount goes, the rest soon follow.

Wheel area:

* Check balljoints and tierods. On most cars jack the front end of the car up using the frame or pinchweld of the car. Hold the tire at 3 and 9 o'clock. shake side to side. a loose tierod will be light feeling. If you start to really shake the wheel back and forth you are going to feel some play from the steering rack. Just a gentle side to side shake. A loose tierod will be obvious, if you aren't sure if its loose, it probably isn't. Now check ball joint by holding the tire top and bottom and really pulling up hard. if the wheel moves you may have a bad ball joint. If the wheel moves up and down easily you may have a bad bearing. Repeat this on the other side.

* Truck/SUV ball joints are checked differently. (the way these are checked are more dependent on the suspension setup. A good rule of thumb is that if the spring is attached to the lower control arm check them with this method). Jack the front suspension up by putting the jack under the control arm. Then use a prybar and pry up on the bottom of the tire. If the wheel moves, you need a lower ball joint. A shake top to bottom can reveal a loose upper ball joint.

* Pull off one of your front wheels and peak at your brake pads. IF they are less than 2/32nds of an inch thick, you need new ones. If your rotors have a big lip around the outside edge you will need to replace your rotors, too. If you want to be thorough pull the caliper off (most cars you only need to remove the bottome bolt then swing the caliper up out of the way) and look for fluid leaking around the caliper piston. Pull a pad and check for cracks. If they are cracked, you need to replace them.

* Pull a rear wheel and repeat the brake inspection in the back. If you have drums, and the drum is stuck on use a hammer and hit the shit out of it. The drum should pop off. But don't hit a wheel stud. That would be a pain in the ass.

* On drums check the shoe thickness. under 1/32nd of an inch and you need to replace them (if there are rivets on the shoe, measure from the top of the rivet to the to of the friction material). Peel back the little boots around the wheel cylinder. If fluid comes pouring out you need wheel cylinders. (If you have a Saturn, you need wheel cylinders).  While you are in there you can adjust the brake out a bit. (google proper procedure for your vehicle)

* Check the tread pattern on all your tires. If they are at the wear bars (little raised pieces inbetween the treads) you need tires. If you have jagged edges you are having a toe issue. If you have excessive wear on one edge you may also have a toe issue. If you have a cupping pattern on the inside edge of the tire you need shocks. 

* Look for oil leaking from your shocks. You don't want oil leaking from your shocks.

Undercar:

* Do all that safe stuff so you don't kill yourself in your driveway

* Look at all of your suspension bushings. The little rubber pieces that are in all of the suspension connections. If you find some rotted out or torn badly. They need replacement. (90's Civics, check your rear suspension trailing arm)

* Look for oil leaks, and try to find the source of the leak. Repair leak. (if you cant find the source, you can get oil dye from your parts store. Just add half a bottle to the oil and recheck in a few weeks)

* Check your exhaust for leaks and rusted hangers.


Ok, I think I covered all of it. Of course there is always more and I hope others can add to my list in the comments.

Please note that I breezed over many things, but my goal here was just to give people something to do and a way to find something to fix on their cars. I hope someone finds this useful!

EDIT: The most important things are really your brakes, ball joints, and tie rods. Those parts are safety items and should be fixed first.

Help!,starboxed,46,9,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1hagqf/mini_dealership_crashed_my_car_on_a_test_drive/,"I took my 2003 Mini Cooper in to my local Mini Dealership on Wednesday.  My brake light censor was faulty (brakes were already replaced) and never went off, and I needed to get an oil change, a new strut mount, and my fluids topped off.
My service guy had told me that he would be in touch Thursday, but never called. So today, I called again just to see what was up price-wise so I could assess my finances, because I knew it was going to be a pretty penny.  He told me that he was waiting on information about my strut mount’s pricing from the “parts department,” and that he would call me back. 

He called me back a few hours later and told me that he had bad news.  Apparently, his technician took my car out for a test drive and was in a “minor” car accident.  My car has always had a little trouble shifting (it’s an automatic), but ONLY at speeds higher than 50.  Anyway, I asked him how bad it was.  He would not tell me anything other than that it was minor, and said he would like to discuss it further in the morning when I pick up a rental car.  He told me that they would pay for the damages from the accident, but that I was still responsible for the original charges.

I am not an expert in cars whatsoever. In fact, I am not even an amateur. This is my very first car, that I bought it from the original owner exactly one year ago this upcoming July. I would like advice on exactly what “minor” might mean; what should I expect tomorrow? What type of things should I ask? Will my insurance go up, even though I wasn’t driving? If someone was seriously injured, am I held responsible?

I am so upset. Any help would be hugely appreciated.

edit; grammar

ACTUAL EDIT 1: I just remembered that my adviser had said that the damage was to the FRONT of the car. I will also update and attach photos tomorrow when I see him at 9AM Pacific, so expect updates in the afternoon. Thanks to everyone who has weighed in thus far, it means a lot. That car is my baby, so I'm just truly hoping it's nothing bad.

EDIT 2: So when we went in there, we - especially yours truly - were completely expecting the worst. I remained ladylike when I walked in there, but you could definitely tell that I wasn't in the best of moods. We met up with my adviser, and he gave us the scoop, and I braced myself. Apparently, an ambulance came out of no where (I live in Vegas, so this does happen at busy intersections. Where the dealership is located, there are 6 lanes of traffic) and everyone had to slam on their brakes.  My car gently clipped the car in front of it, and he said that the person who the technician hit in my car didn't even feel it. My adviser showed me pictures that he had taken on his phone ([they had already taken off my bumper when I arrived](http://oi41.tinypic.com/evat7a.jpg)), and the brunt of the force was taken by my license plate. There was also a little ripple in my chrome and paint. Honestly, the way it looked from the photos, it looked like if you had parked and hit the curb stop, it would have caused more damage. To say I was lofty on relief is an understatement. He also said that the technician who was in the accident is going to be doing the repairing for his mistake (he is OK, by the way. I asked, because I would have felt horrible had someone been hurt in my car).

So, they are repairing all of the damages, detailing, and repainting my car free of charge. They are also deducting 15% of the initial price of what I brought it in there for (strut mount, oil change, fluids), and giving me a free, 2-year warranty that covers EVERYTHING they fixed: prior and after the accident. They also said that this is not going to go on my record, my car didn't lose any value, and that my airbags didn't deploy or anything. So, I looked at the paperwork, then consulted with my sister and brother-in-law who came with, called another dealership in California, and they agreed that this was fair. 

Right now, I feel a lot more satisfied. What do you guys think? Was this gone about in the right way? I didn't think that talking it somewhere else for the type of damage I saw (seriously, it would've been more damaged had I hit a small bird of something) was adequate, especially when they seemed to really be concerned with my happiness and were apologetic. Or maybe that's just my naivete talking, but I do feel like they went above and beyond to prove why my dedication as a customer is valued. What are you thoughts, guys?

I've imagined all kinds of nasty scenarios, usually involving the transmission breaking or exploding (I mean breaking down, I don't mean Michael Bay explosions) and other bad things happening, like the car flipping over or something. I'm sure they're all highly unlikely. And I'm smart enough to not just try it (aren't we all?) so, for those of you who know transmissions inside and out... What happens?

My most optimistic guess is that the transmission goes to neutral and waits for the car to decelerate to a certain point before actually shifting (and thus giving the driver a chance to correct the error), but I'm really not sure.

1366213412.0,26,self.MechanicAdvice,1cjdgz,Anybody know what kind of vehicle hit my car last night? [X-Post from /askreddit],the_Black_Rabbit,29,3,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1cjdgz/anybody_know_what_kind_of_vehicle_hit_my_car_last/,"[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1cj6ph/anybody_know_what_kind_of_vehicle_hit_my_car_last/)

So I got up this morning to a policeman pounding on my door.

I come outside and see my car ""parked"" in front of my neighbor's driveway. Funny, I didn't park it there.

I come around the car and see this: [picture 1](http://i.imgur.com/cxFmnP5.jpg). And here's a closer look: [picture 2](http://i.imgur.com/mqow4qN.jpg).

Anyway, I file a police report. Called my insurance company and filed a claim. Not much more I can do right now, other than wait.

While cleaning up the debris off the road, I noticed a few pieces that didn't come from my car: [picture 3](http://i.imgur.com/veg0i5v.jpg).

Kind of a long shot, but if any of you reddit detectives can tell me something from this little bit of information, you'd really make my day. Hasn't been a real kind last few weeks (lost job, lost girlfriend...lost car now).

Thanks guys!

**Edit1:** I've went back through the debris, and separated it a little more. So I think I found some more pieces of the other car's ""headlight"":  [picture 4](http://i.imgur.com/wW07U4S.jpg) (i will update when i can put the pieces together).

I also found this piece, which may or may not be from my car, any ideas?: [picture 5](http://i.imgur.com/Cqw4dTA.jpg)



**Edit2:** I've found a few more identifiers on two pieces of the headlight cover. [Picture 6](http://i.imgur.com/0fMlGrb.jpg) and [picture 7](http://i.imgur.com/kbDiR0p.jpg).

It appears these two pieces were originally together, and if i put them together they spell out the following:


&gt;[HMC]SAMLIP 101  (break)   -1300 KOREA RH

&gt;SAE HR -I5-P-0     (break)    0 DOT VOL &gt;PC&lt; H1

(the 'break' is where the split in the pieces takes place)



**Edit3:** So I took a few hours and super-glued together the pieces (so long as they fit correctly). And here's a few pictures of what I got: [picture 8](http://i.imgur.com/CNOocvY.jpg), [picture 9](http://i.imgur.com/eeTrFuO.jpg), and [picture 10](http://i.imgur.com/gPLdYzg.jpg).",,False,,t5_2tkvu,1366256703.0,,,True,t3_1cjdgz,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1cjdgz/anybody_know_what_kind_of_vehicle_hit_my_car_last/,

A few days ago my parents heard a clanging noise coming from the front tires when they started the car in the morning. Since it was also time for the front brakes to be replaced, my dad took it in to get it looked at and fixed. His English isn't great and he ended up paying over $1500 for ""repairs"". From what I understand, nothing is fixed. The tire still makes the sound and they never replaced the brakes either. 

None of us are mechanics and we don't know much about cars so even deciphering the invoice is difficult. If anyone could offer any advice on what the parts listed on the invoice are and why we would need them, it would be greatly appreciated. 

Another thing is we're really confused why we are paying so much in 'labor'. Out of the $1500 we paid, $1200 was for labor. Is this normal? 

Obviously $1500 is a lot of money and definitely not something we would be okay throwing away. With that said, I know that there's pretty much little to nothing we can do about it now, since we already paid. Still, I'd like to know if they were justified in charging us so much.  The car was in pretty good condition and we've never had major problems with it in all the years we've had it (we bought it new), we take very good care of it so this came as a shock. 

In the end, we still don't know why the tires were making that noise, and they mentioned putting in an order for even MORE parts that they would need to fix the car and having us bring the car in AGAIN to fix what they didn't this time. They insisted on leaving the car there for the entire day, didn't work on it other than finding all sorts of problems with it, and then proceeded to charge us what seemed to be an entire day's pay for the entire crew. 

Anyway, any sort of insight would be very much appreciated. Thanks to everyone in advance.",,False,,t5_2tkvu,False,,,True,t3_1gfz7v,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1gfz7v/car_experts_of_reddit_i_desperately_need_your/,

He half assdly runs a shop out of THEIR home garage. 

Now my girlfriend and her sister know nothing about cars, so they just take him at his word. Growing up my family fixed everything, there are very few parts I haven't replaced at some point in my life. I'm rusty with cars now because other then a simple break job or an oil change I choose not to work on cars. My problem with her sisters boyfriend is that he's no more qualified then me, but he's arrogant. We've butted heads more then once when he said something that's made now since. For example when her power steering acted up once last year, he said she needed a new power steering pump (without looking at the car), I simply said her car doesn't have a power steering pump because it uses electric power steering. According to him I didn't know what I was talking about because ""all cars use power steering pumps"".

Anyway coming to the most recent issues. About 4 months ago my girlfriend brought her car to have it inspected. Well it was there she asked if they could tell her what was causing a small clunk when when she went over bumps and give her a quote if it was serious. They told there was a little play in the sway bar links causing it, it wasn't anything that was a safety hazard, I can't remember what they quoted her but I remember looking up the parts at the time and the quote was only like $50 more then the parts. I suggested she let the shop do it but she didn't want to piss off her sister so she let her sisters boyfriend do it.

I don't know where to start with this fiasco. He came in after working on the car for like 6 hours, and tells he installed the sway bar links, but  while doing this the car fell off the jack and ruined the radiator. He claimed it took him one week just to find a radiator for the car, and then two weeks went by with her car out of commission. Finally I said screw this and despite hating working on cars I replaced the radiator. I was expecting there to be a whole from something going through it or a crack from it dropping on something but instead I find this http://i.imgur.com/f7mQ7kS.jpg?1 . Is it just me or does it look like he jacked the freaking car up from the radiator?

This brings me to now, 4 months later. My girlfriends sister totaled her car so she's been borrowing my girlfriends car to get to work. Last week when she took it to work I guess she heard a clunk. So she again asks the boyfriend to look at it. Now he claims the sway bar links he bought were defective, and when they snapped they ruined the sway bar. Also he claims the CV shaft has gone bad, he didn't give much detail on that. Lastly he claims the breaks AND rotors are shot. The breaks and rotors really get me, because for starters I'm fairly certain I would have noticed if the breaks were so bad the rotors were being affected. Also I know the breaks get checked during NYS inspection and I find it odd that they went from ok, to worn to the point of destroying the rotors in 4 months.

Just to be clear they don't pay him for his time (he fixes the car instead of paying child support), they just buy the parts. So it's not that I think he is ripping them off, I just feel like he doesn't know what the f*** he's doing and has no real business working on cars.

Well, that was ridiculously simple. It's a 5 minute job that took me 15 minutes, simply because I didn't have a magnetic socket to hold the bolt easier. I took the suggestions here and watched a YouTube video on how to do it (for an Outback, but the same sensor and process). The most difficult part was getting the bolt started, and part of that was the amount of crap that accumulates in that spot (vacuum it out before you remove the old sensor).

The best part, which I had no idea about, was the massive increased power in replacing the knock sensor! The car would previously drag itself up hills, but now zooms up them (and I have some substantial hills on the way home).

Am I fucked?,LOLumad1013,22,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1hhz36/i_accidently_put_6_litresabout_15_gallons_of/,"I dont need a lecture on how much of an idiot I am. (I had been arguing with my fiancee about possibly ending our relationship and without paying attention put the wrong fuel in my tank)

1. 6.33 litres(1.5 gallons) of ""super"" unleaded fuel was put into my empty tank(This is what it is called at the pump in Germany where I am right now visiting my fiancee).

2. 35.74 litres(9.44 gallons) of ""diesel"" fuel was added immediately before I even started my vehicle. 

3. After filling the tank to full the rest of the way with diesel I let the car sit for about 2 minutes then turned the vehicle on and drove about 1.5 miles home without allowing my rpm's to rise past 1500.(I took it very easy on the way home)

I then parked the car and am writing this.

My question is should I or should I not drive this vehicle now? As it stands the tank has about 17% super unleaded fuel and the rest Diesel(including what was left in the reserve which I was using when driving to the gas station). I noticed no issue on the way back home but I also do not think the vehicle had driven far enough to have any new fuel pushed through the engine.

**Edit:** Thanks for all the advice. I wish I would have seen it earlier but I had to drive about 35 km away so a 70 km round trip. I tried to keep the rpms below 1500 but at times they got up to 2000. I did not go faster than 100 km/h(60 mph?) and am safely home. To be honest, i saw no difference in the way the car handled, started(multiple times. the bank twice(forgot wallet at home), or in how it accelerated and ran.

I thought this would be useful for anyone that comes across a similar situation. I'm in Canada, and I found a section of the [Consumer Protection Act, 2002](http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_050017_e.htm#BK70) which directly pertains to motor vehicle repairs in the context of billing, etc.

Essentially, a shop cannot charge you more than 10% of the price you agreed to when an estimate was provided on the initial work order. If a shop expects to exceed this amount, they must attain consent from you, either verbal or written, for the amount you're willing to pay (if desired, a maximum may be provided). **The time and date of this authorization** must be recorded and provided, whether it is written or verbal (over the phone).

I had received calls from the garage, stating that they were working on getting the wheel off (it was stuck), but no mention was given of the base price changing. As such, when the shop was confronted with the above-mentioned information, they were unable to provide me with a date/time of my supposed authorization, and so the bill was reduced from $250CAD, to $89 plus taxes (base price of tire change, plus 10%). 

I hope this helps someone someday.

first, please don't laugh at me.  Too much.  And I hope this is appropriate for this reddit.

When I was a kid, we used to own a massive early-1970s Buick Skylark (I'm old), and I helped a friend fix up an ex-cop Plymouth Fury III from about the same time.  I've always wanted a gynormous road-boat muscle car as I love the feel and size of the things.

Problem is, I live in Europe where emissions standards and gas prices are equally gynormous, removing this as an attractive option.

So my hopelessly naive question to the experts is:  

1. is it hypothetically possible to drop a new high-performance turbodiesel or even a modern petrol engine (e.g. from an M5 or S8) into an old American body, along with transmission, electronics, etc.?  
2. would this work?

My mechanic thinks he can fix it. 3rd opinions?,thatthatguy,25,7,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1hp46r/car_accident_insurance_wants_to_total_my_mechanic/,"An F-150 hit my van (2005 Dodge Caravan) from behind.  (http://imgur.com/6ENq1vY) (Yes, that is the Ford's license plate imprinted in the hatch)  It drives fine.  The break lights work, it appears to be legal.  I put 50 miles on it going to work and back this week, can't tell any difference (except air drag from the missing back window).

The Ford's insurance company hired an appraiser.  The appraiser said the frame is buckled, and it would cost $7000 to fix.  The Insurance company offered us around $5200, which is what kelley blue book says is the expected dealer price.  They say they'll sell the car back to me as scrap for $1125.

My mechanic has always treated me fair, and (as far as I know) been straight with me.  I brought it down, and he said he could replace the hatch, and bumper, straighten out the side panel, and make the thing work for under $2000.  It won't be as good as new, there will be some paint mismatch, and bumps in the panels he doesn't replace.  Still, he says it will be serviceable.

I can't see any evidence the frame is damaged.  The hatch is destroyed, the bumper will need to be replaced, along with whatever crush material is under it.  The left side panel is deformed.  Left tail light is out of place, but works fine.

I've gotten a number of opinions.  Mostly it boils down to my wife (and her father, and the Ford's insurance company) thinks we should just take the $5200, and buy another van.  Possibly taking the $5200 as a down payment on a newer one.  I (and my father, and my mechanic/cousin) think it can be fixed.  If I buy the scrap for $1125, and pay $2000 for repairs, I could probably drive it for a few more years.  I'd save the $2000 left over toward the maintenance/replacement fund.

If the frame is actually buckled, there is a legitimate concern about safety.  A damaged frame will be less resistant to another impact, and may cause problems to any number of other systems up the line.  Many of you will know more about this than I do.

I need to tread carefully.  She has her motherly concern for the safety of our 4 kids (hence why we have a van in the first place), and I must build a strong case for repairing the car if I'm to persuade her.  I've convinced my wife to at least let me take it to a body shop, and let them get in under the bumper to look for damage.  We've also agreed to talk to our favorite car dealer (an old family friend), and ask what he would do if it here his.

What does /r/MechanicAdvice think?  Is the risk of hidden damage such that I should just let them junk the car?  Should I let a body shop break down the back end before making a decision?

I did get hired at a general service shop, but I have been terminated due to ""lack of experience."" Oil changes, tires, and brakes are a piece of cake, so what's the problem here? Am I too courteous to the other techs? So I have a few questions from a beginner to an experienced tech.

1. If you hire on a newbie like me, how do you get a feeling for them and what they are capable of? 
2. What do you expect from them?
3. If you have them shadow another tech, what exactly do you want them to do; watch or join in and help?
4. Do you want a new tech asking for work, or would you prefer them to wait for a job?

I ask this because I was waiting for a job. I was hourly, and I didn't want to take jobs from the flat rate guys. They other techs also didn't want me to help out, I assume, because it's **their** job, and it's their ass if the car goes out any less than 100%. Now because of this, I wasn't able to prove to them I can do this, and consequently lost an opportunity.

What I would like to know is if I could ""change"" the fluid by siphoning fluid from where the dipstick is located with a hand pump, and then adding (the same amount of fluid that I took out) back into the same location? I've done this method for brake and power steering fluid. 

One concern I have is the filter not being changed...but I've read that these filters are more like screens than filters and don't need to be replaced.

Do you think this problem is his fault? Is there any way to even know?

Some backstory: 

I've been using the same mechanic for about 10 years, and have never had any reason not to trust him. A few months ago, my wife's car needed some work done. The work was about $400, and he did the work without discussing it with me at all first. When I asked him about why he responded that he thought I had just wanted him to fix it.


I was annoyed, but I figured it was just a miscommunication. I brought my own car to him a couple of weeks ago. I have had a small power-steering fluid leak for a while (that I have not been able to afford repairing properly), and he had been filling up my fluid and making sure the leak wasn't worsening. Also, my car had just overheated the previous day. To top it off, the driver's seat was rocking a bit and I needed a new inspection.


Still annoyed that he had done the work last time without clearing it, I was *very* clear that I expected him to call me before doing any more work.  


He told me he would get back to me later that day, but did not. I called him a couple of times the next day, but he did not call me back. When I spoke to him on the third day, he told me that the car was just about ready for pickup. I figured that it must have been something easy that he had quickly repaired, but it turned out that he had done $750 worth of work (and the inspection). He still had the seat to fix, but was working on it and I could come by in an hour.


I went in to discuss this with him. Again, I was annoyed, but since I trusted him I never questioned the necessity of the work or the cost. I paid him in full immediately, but made it clear that I was very upset. He responded by apologizing and telling me about how sick his wife has been and how much time he has been spending with her. THat then dominated the conversation.


I started the car and the check engine light went on and the seat was still rocking. I needed to take the car, but brought it back that afternoon. During driving, it had started to smell like some sort of fluid. He told me the stink was coolant (some residual spillage from his work) and that it would go away after a couple of days.


I picked up the car the next day. The seat had been fixed, and the check engine light was off.


Either that night of the next (I'm not sure when the next time I drove at night was) I noticed that while the check-engine light was off, so was its entire surrounding section of the dash lights (as if a portion of the lights had been disabled). Also, the car took 2-3 attempts to start. The smell persisted, but I assumed it was just the spilled coolant he had mentioned. I couldn't bring the car right back, as I needed it over the next few days.

Over the next week or so, the car continued to need 2-3 attempts to start (I believe every time), and the smell was getting worse. I brought the car back to him. This time, he said that the metal that feeds the fuel had rusted out and that I needed to replace it, at a cost of about $400. 

I asked to see the problem, and it seems pretty clear that he leak is at the site where he just installed a new hose. The metal definitely looks chewed up, but I am now very wary and believe that he crushed the part due to some sort of carelessness. \

Now we're trying to figure out what the heck is actually wrong with it. The clunk only occurs when turning left or right, and it's most noticable at low speed.

The forward axle will clunk, and there is a visible wheel ""skip"" or ""hop"" on the pavement, and then immediately afterwards the rear axle will do the same, always in time.

I have a 2002 Honda Civic.  I think my mechanic is yanking me around.  I don't know what to do.  He has great reviews but in the past 3 months, my service has left me poorer and with a car that's worse off than it was before.

I live in Virginia.  My car started shaking on startup and jerking back and forth (not side to side) while pressing the gas about 2 months ago.  I brought it in to the shop, and they said I needed new spark plugs.  They did the repair, and it worked fine for 1 month and 2 days.  The problem started back, so I scheduled an appointment.  The day before my my appointment, my radiator cracked, so I got that replaced too.  They said an induction service would fix the spark plug issue.

A month and 3 days later, the jerking came back.  I immediately brought it in to the shop (Friday) and told them they needed to figure out the underlying issue because clearly something is causing the spark plugs to go.  They shouldn't break this often.  The diagnostic revealed that my ignition coils and fuel injectors needed replacement.  They said I could replace one of each and get along for a while until the others break down, or go ahead and replace them all and it would solve the problem.  I opted to replace them all.  I feel like they should have figured out what was going on from the start, or at least by the second time I was in the shop.

Less than 12 hours after the ""repair,"" my car starts jerking again.  But it's not jerking like before.  It's shaking violently when I idle, and it's jerking more than it ever has while driving (even when not pressing the gas).  It was terrifying to drive home in, and I had to use my hazards and drive under 40 (over 40 and the shaking got worse).  At one point, I pulled over to let the engine cool off a bit.  I popped the hood and smelled burning coolant.  So that means not only did they not get the coil problem fixed, but it seems like they didn't get the radiator fixed properly either.

This is a Midas, so a corporate chain, they have an A+ rating with the BBB at this location and glowing reviews all over the internet, and so I had no reason to believe they would jerk me around like this.  I don't know what to do.  I've poured every ounce of my savings into fixing this car, and they've essentially made it worse.  What can I do?  Do I have any legal recourse?  I'd like to ask them to pay for it to be repaired elsewhere because I don't trust them to do it anymore.  Or can I get a refund or something?  I'm so lost.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  

Thanks for reading.

Everything was going great -- it did turn out to be a lot harder than I expected -- except after a long day and the over-eagerness inherent to completing a difficult project, I pulled a rookie move.

After adding four quarts of ATF+4, I immediately checked the fluid level. It was perfect. Okay, great! Ignition, throw it in gear, and reverse up my driveway -- and then circled right back down into my driveway when I realized that something was not right. It wasn't shifting properly, at all, and made some uncomfortable sounds. I shut off the engine and popped the hood -- a fair amount of white-ish smoke drifted out. Crap.

So, I checked the fluid level -- bone dry.

Just how badly do you think I damaged my transmission? After adding more fluid, letting it run for a while, adding more fluid (in total, another four quarts) and shifting into D/N/R a few times with my foot on the break, it seems to be running great.

Last Thursday my gf took her car in because it was leaking oil. On Friday they called to tell her it was done, then 2 hours later called back and told her it was stolen from their shop. We rushed down there, talked to the cops, then watched some survillance cameras. While this was going on she decided to go walk into the service bay to see where they leave the keys, so we could better understand what we were looking at. On her way to the door the manager starts acting all sketchy asking ""where are you going?"" and chasing her to the door. When she got out to the bay she noticed her car sitting in the very back with only 2 other cars, I couldn't believe they wouldn't have seen it back there.

They apologize and hand the car over, then she drives it home (only about an hour away.) Then the next day she gets in to drive it and its making tons of noise. Her cousin whom is a certified mechanic (but refuses to work on german cars) comes to look at it, the Catalytic Converter fell off the exhaust manifold. That doesn't just happen, that thing is welded on.

So now here's my thought process, they claimed the car was stolen cause they fucked it up so bad that they were probably gonna strip it and have insurance deal with it.

My question is what should be done, should she hire a lawyer (it's only worth about $3000 it seems like a lawyer might be too much money for a cheap car like this). Should I threaten them with calling the BBB and the attorney generals office? The first thing I told her to do is call her insurance company and have all of this documented.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

With the car running and accessories off it reads 12.2v

I checked for corrosion on all the cables that eventually end up at the battery.

I have a 6.5L Turbo Diesel 1994 Blazer that is in very decent shape. I have worked my tail off to get the mechanical and the electrical issues ""up-to-snuff"". Also I install a class IV hitch and wiring to hopefully get a slick Toy Hauler I have wanted forever.

So this weekend I got the Toy Hauler..... in Pennsylvania...... home is in Ohio.......hills suck.

Long story short, I left the automatic transmission in Overdrive (twice) and I would not say I overheated, but nearly redlined overheated the engine (twice).

Both times, after I pulled over the let the engine cool I had ""Low Coolant"" lights from the reservoir dumping the excess/hot coolant. I refilled the coolant to proper levels and resumed my trip and ensured the transmission was in **Drive**. Remaining trip I stayed on the State Highways and **took my time** going up the hills. No issues for 150+ miles back home. No coolant in the oil, no oil in the coolant. Minor oil usage likely due to my Turbo which may need rebuilt.

My question, what potential damage could have occurred because of my Overdrive Towing Dumbassery? Engine head warpage? Transmission carnage? Anything I should inspect to ensure proper future functionality?

I've never been this deep into an engine before, but between my neighbors expert guidance, the service manual and help from you guys I feel pretty confident.

The heads off, its warped by a few thousands of an inch more than I'm comfortable with, (.008in) the head is being machined soon. 

I was going to just hone the cylinders, replace rings and bearings. Yes, I know this isn't the recommended route, but with a used engine with low miles only $1100, its just not worth going all out. Do you guys have any specific input on this? Any experience here?
Bottom line, should I even bother with the pistons?

I own a 2007 Nissan Versa S (hatchback) and recently had to get it smogged when renewing my registration. It (surprise, surprise) failed smog. I knew that I needed a new O2 sensor, so I made the repair, but the car still failed! So, I took it into the dealership and they (supposedly) located the problem (something else was wonky and was affecting the fuel/oxygen mix).

So, here's my problem. The part is covered under warranty and should be free, but the dealer cannot (or will not) make the repair for free until the check engine light comes on so that they can get the ""appropriate code"" and get approval from corporate to do the repair. However, when I got the new O2 sensor my normal mechanic ""cleared"" the check engine light; so, the dealer told me to drive the car until the light came back on.

I've now driven the car 300+ miles, and the light has not come back on. I'm wondering if I, for example, unplug a spark plug to try to get the check engine light to come back on, will it display the right code so I can get my repair done (and covered by warranty)? Or will it display the code for the wonky spark plug (or whatever self-inflicted wound I dole out to get the light on)?

I know very, VERY little about cars, but I found the prescription from the dealer to be a little strange/suspect. Is the dealer trying to get out of making the fix? Or do I really need to keep driving my car until the check engine light comes on? Any and all advice/help is much appreciated!

**tl;dr: I need my check engine light to come on to get a specific problem covered by my warranty. Driving 300+ miles hasn't done it. What to do?**

Here is the estimate that the man who's car I scratched sent to me.

[report](http://i.imgur.com/iIMbG.png)

It costs $1,081. Is this normal? Why does the rear door need work done as the report says? 


From this report, can you tell me what they are trying to do?

EDIT: general conclusion seems to be that the price does seem to be high, but not over the top. I expected the price to be around $200, but the general consensus seems a normal body paint and repair costs for this are $800.

Are these a good idea, or is adding some product like this just going to be bad news for an older engine? Just being able to throw a fluid into the oil and have a chance at stopping or slowing the leak down sounds almost too good to be true. The engine is designed to work specifically with a certain type of oil. Won't adding something else in throw things off, potentially out of spec for the original design, and potentially cause engine damage?

I'm all for giving it a shot, but not being able to find how these products are supposed to work, as well as adding things to my engine that it wasn't designed to work with, is giving me definite pause.

I did some more testing on my car yesterday and found i had an open circuit in the starter solenoid wire in the dashboard harness. i also had a voltage drop of 1V on the solenoid wire plug on the ignition switch. The car would not crank from the key, only by jumping the solenoid terminal to the battery positive. 


My solution, rather than replacing a 150$ ignition switch and paying to get my key reprogrammed at the dealer, was to de-pin the dashboard connector, run a new starter solenoid wire for that harness, re-pin it into the connector, and attach it to a delco-remy starter switch (momentary push button). 
For 12v, i wired the other side of the switch into another wire on the ignition switch plug that only receives 12v with the key on. No key, no start. Now everything works perfectly.

Mileage ~ 59600. (I have a 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty)

The story: Recently I noticed the car was just having awful mileage (for instance a trip from chicago to iowa city used up nearly an entire tank of gas, while in the past the car could make that trip on closer to half a tank). Acceleration seemed laggy to me as well. I do not have good knowledge of cars, and so I asked my girlfriend's dad what could be causing poor gas mileage. He suggested the air filter may need replacement, and so we decided to take a look. He was horrified to find the air filter apparatus was not properly sealed over the air filter, and the air filter itself appeared brand new. I'm sorry I don't have any pictures, but it looked completely unused, suggesting it was not filtering at all. We have no idea how it came to be like that, but I can assume that it must be very bad for my engine, since I frequently drive on unpaved roads in iowa, and the car has been on several long-range highway drives since last service. We checked the oil, and it was almost completely empty. Coolant was low as well, though not so critically as the oil. My gf's dad said the engine could explode if there's no oil, so we immediately went to walmart and filled it up with 2 quarts of oil. 

First thing this morning I took the car to the nearest Mazda dealership and gave them the same play-by-play as above asking them to: Examine the air filter apparatus, perform an oil change/vital fluids check, and examine the engine for any possible damage from all the unfiltered air and from running on low oil for who knows how long. They said they were completely busy today but would try and squeeze it into their schedule. They said they would perform a compression test and move forward from there to assess the engine. I said that was good, explained my warranty, and assuming the car would be there all day I got a rental and left. 

Then just an 1.5 hours later I got a call saying they performed the compression test and everything is fine and the car is ready to be picked up. My gf's dad thinks they are bs'ing us. Basically:

-We have the warranty they may be trying to avoid. He does not think they took the time to properly look at the engine and assess if there was any damage. Instead, he thinks they just put a band-aid over the problem. But he believes the car is unsafe to drive, and that the engine is likely to fail sometime after our warranty expires, screwing us over.

And so he believes we should cut our losses and trade the car in, and not have to worry about it. 

Given the situation, what do you think I should do with the car, or what do you think needs to be done?

It is also relevant I was supposed to drive that car to chicago today, and I was supposed to take it California in 3 weeks

TL/DR Malfunctioning air filter may have led to engine damage. Unsure if mazda dealership gave good advice.

The main difference is that i use power tools more often (grinders, impact guns, air ratchets, ect.) and recently i have been getting alot of numbness in my right hand. Not just when i am using the tools but very often and at random times. it is always set on by using the tools and is more intense when using them.

I know you guys aren't doctors but have you heard this issue before? Have you experienced it? I think its something that will go away with time and my body just isn't used to the constant vibrations caused by the tools. Something similar happened when i started at the quick lube, i had major hand cramps from gripping the filters but that went away.

Should i be worried about the numbness? Should i wait it out or go talk to a doctor? have you had this happen to you? what can i do to calm it down/ stop it?

About a 5 weeks ago (I can't believe its been that long &gt;_&lt;) I was in a car accident. The accident was a road rage issue on the other drivers part. At 45-50 mph the other driver swerved in front of me and slammed on his breaks. Cops showed up and arrested him on a warrant. The insurance companies deems that it was his fault.

Immediately after the accident, my engine light was on and my car was smoking. I took it to my body shop and left it there. The appraiser came out and said they would do the body work first then look at the mechanical problems.

$5500 in body work and 3 weeks later, I go to pick up my car and its still smoking. I walk the 15 feet to my mechanic right next door and he tells me its my turbo. He said it would need to be replaced.

The insurance appraiser came back out and talked to the mechanic. She said the mechanic told her it could be from the accident but he can't tell for sure either way. Of course the insurance company falls on the side of its not from the accident.

Do I have anything here? I can't exactly afford a major repair on this car at the moment. It seems pretty logical to me that if something was working, there was an accident and then something is not working its because of the accident. My insurance company tried to tell me cars are built to take impact. I disagreed and said they are meant to keep drivers safe at impact, not the car.

I guess I'm just looking to see if there is anything I can use to help sway my insurance company. I know its not the usual way turbos die, but I don't see why its impossible that an accident could cause it to fail.

Edit: This is a Mazda CX7 2007 75000 miles. Oil change done hours before the accident, no smoking or issues before or after the oil change.

What happened was, I looked at an 07 honda accord that looked very clean, both inside and out. The inside was super clean, no mold, no smell. Under the hood, there were some rusts, but that happens in New England due to salt and snow on the road. The car ran very well during my test drive. All electrical stuff works, and no lights are on.  Once I paid, registered the vehicle, drove home, I got suspicious. I found signs underneath the spare tire in the trunk of flood water having been there at some point. It looks like carpeting and everything inside was professionally redone, so it is very hard by looking at the interior that it had been under water. It may just be that the water didn't get very high, but I am now wondering what my options are. 

I contacted the seller (I thought he was a private party, but turns out is a used car dealer) and he maintains that the car was never flooded, but says he can take it back once I receive the title from the DMV. Problem is, the DMV takes almost 90 days to process the title because this was a NJ title being transferred to NY DMV. Can I sell the car back to the guy/dealer without having the title in my hand. I have all registration documents. I looked under the seats, all the wires look new. barely any rust on the bottom part of the seat. The car has a gentle vibration in Park and Neutral, but no issues in Drive mode (have read this could be a motor mount issue). That's all there is to the car, no other problems so far. Any advice on whether I should stop driving the car altogether for potential safety issues, and how I can sell the car back to the guy/dealer before I have the title in my hand would be appreciated.

Edit: Here are some pictures showing the things I've mentioned: http://imgur.com/a/xRF8w
Edit2: I agree this is not incontrovertible evidence of flooding, but to me that is the most straightforward explanation when considered in the context of where the car was used before (Sandy flood zone in NJ), when it was auctioned off (2 months after Sandy), and the fact that the guy who sold me the car started saying he'll take it back when I get the title (wont happen for 3 months) once I told him I found crud under the spare tire and a mechanic told me the car had been flooded and that I would file a complaint with the Division of Consumer Affairs against his used car dealership.

Foul play?,prius_jess,15,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/18ncec/airbag_light_on_after_servicing_foul_play/,"I need some help understanding what happened to my car at servicing at a toyota dealership. I don't know much about cars, but this situation seems very suspicious to me. 

I dropped my car off two Thursdays ago for servicing. I planned to leave the car with them overnight because I needed the 150,000 mi servicing, the steering extension shaft recall, an oil change, and a new battery. The technicians performed a safety check as per the 150,000 mi servicing and reported nothing wrong with the airbag system.

I picked my car up at the end of the following day. When I started up my car, I noticed that the read air bag light was on in the car. Since the servicing center was closing and they had reported to me that my car was safe, I did not think there was a safety issue. I left with my car and parked it in my driveway for the weekend. On Monday, while driving, I noticed that the lights in my steering wheel were not on and none of the buttons worked (cruise control, volume, temperature, ect.). I called the Toyota dealership that afternoon and left a message. They called me back on Tuesday and scheduled me to come in on Thursday. 

The dealership called me later that day to tell me that the electronic component to my spiral cable had shorted out and that it was just an unlucky ""coincidence"" that it happened right after servicing the vehicle. There are a few confusions that I have regarding this statement: 

1) the technician who drove my car around stated that he did not see my airbag light on (and would not have let me leave the lot with this safety issue), which would mean that the light had to turn on after he parked the car and gave me my keys. The light was on when I turned on my vehicle. I know that this part can break during normal driving, but can the spiral cable break while in park (as the dealership is asking me to believe)? 

2) The technicians and manager are stating that the work on my car was not done near my steering wheel, where the spiral cable is located. I had the steering intermediate extension shaft recall done and it states on the Toyota recall website that the metal splines that were replaced ""complete the connection from steering wheel to steering gear"". Also, my steering was adjusted as part of this recall. The dealership continued to state that the work was no where near my steering wheel. I called the toyota headquarters and asked them about the work and they stated that some of the replacement work has to be done within the steering wheel. I spoke again with the manager at Toyota, who was not happy with me for insinuating that he was lying. He essentially told me I could have the work done there or come and remove my (unsafe) car from the lot. 

I have spoken to three different people at the dealership, who have each given me three different quotes for the work. This entire situation seems very shady to me, but I wanted to get some advice before I proceed.

 Or how does MAF play into this more air means more gas but there has to be some limits in the ecu right? You see the charts on intake and exhaust systems they sell claiming gained hp/tq with their parts.

I bought it knowing about a couple of minor issues and have pretty much taken care of most of them. However I have 2-3 residual issues that I am having trouble diagnosing/repairing.

The first has to do with the brakes. I recently had the shop I normally do business with look at the brakes and do an inspection. When we purchased it the emergency brake seemed to be inoperative. The shop inspected the brakes, but stated that all the brakes appeared to have been recently done. However, the two rear hub seals had failed and the rear brake housings were coated in grease. They cleaned the rear brakes after replacing the seals, then adjusted the e-brake to specs, but the e-brake will not hold the van when in reverse or drive. They said they tried to adjust to a tighter tolerance, but the brakes started to smoke when driven. Supposedly the mechanic asked around and this issue is common for the older E350 SD due to the weight of the vehicle. I'm just having a hard time believing that the NHTSA would pass a van for sale in the US with an e-brake that didn't work.

Then second issue has to do with a rubbing sound that occurs in hard right hand turns. The issue existed when we first looked at the van, but the PO attributed the issue to broken plastic retainer clips that keep the front-passenger brake line away from the tire. He repaired it at our request and the issue wasn't present when we picked the van up from him. However, the issue started up again. I checked out the brake line and it doesn't appear to be rubbing (plastic clips are in place), though it is pretty close to the tire.

Lastly, it has developed a hard start issue. Having owned several diesels before (Isuzu Pup, VW Jetta, Ford F250 (6.9)) I would normally say that it probably needs glow plugs. However, I'm not experienced with the 7.3 Fords. Are there other things I should check before I drop $80-90 on new ones?

So the switch does say on/off. it appears to be just electrical taped in to a mess of wires and just hanging. Tucked into an inconspicuous area. I've flipped the switch a few times, doesn't seem to do anything. The car does have an after market remote starter installed (from the previous owner). Though i have no idea why a remote starter would have a switch under the dash. I don't know. My only other guess, maybe it has something to do with resetting engine codes. I did notice the check engine light turned off. (not sure if engine fixed itself or light burnt out). but seriously, the check engine light has turned off at other times randomly. (the car is old, error codes galore. i have a buddy with a tuner/scanner and scanned my car awhile back.) The car drives fine so im not worried fixing all the error codes.


tl:dr It's a magic switch that does *drum roll* NOTHING!!!!!

That's fine for a normal commute, but I have another, weekly commute- up to the mountain to go snowboarding. On the way down the mountain the car never warms up... the idle doesn't do it and there's no combustion while engine braking. Is this so uncommon of a situation that manufacturers don't care?

The coolant in the reservoir looks clean and when I popped off a coolant hose, the coolant that came out looked clean as well.

Also, I popped the valve cover off and it all looked generally normal except for the area near the valve cover breather, where there was a small area coated with milkshake/mayonnaise. I removed the breather hose and the PCV valve and both were gunked with milkshake. Come the weekend, I'll be removing the intake manifold and cleaning it all down along with an oil change.

Needless to say, the keys aren't interchangable. The one that opens the door isn't a toyota key, but an assex (the company you can if you go to hom depot to get your keys made), the one used to start the car is a toyota key (plain silver, no remote chip, black end).

So we tried to make copies of both keys twice, both times the key that opens the door, both of its copies worked fine. But the key that starts the car, its copies wouldn't start the car.

I'm lost because, the key being cut looks identical, it's not one of those with a remote chip, I don't see what else it could be?

I apologize if this isn't the right place (I couldn't think of a better place for it)..  This isn't about getting ripped off money-wise, I just want to know what the likely scenario is, and what my options might be for this situation.

So a little while back I had to take my car (A 2001 Ford Taurus) into a Midas shop for something, I believe it was a belt that needed replacing, an oil change, and maybe one or two other things.  Two days after I left, something else went wrong and my engine light came back on... I didn't blame Midas at all, I think it was unrelated.  So I took it back, they fixed whatever it was, and so I left. Upon leaving the parking lot, it came back on.  Getting irritated at this point, I take it back.. They immediately look at it and realize they forgot to plug some sensors back in (I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, figuring shit happens; however, I'd decided I'd be using my old mechanic again, because this was kind of silly).  And I left, had no issues at all. All is good, until..

Today I went to get an oil change at an instant oil change place (not midas).  After sitting there for ~45 minutes, they finally come up and say ""Look, we can't get your drain plug off, whoever did your last oil change over-tightened it. We'll have to issue a refund and then we recommend going to the last place that you got an oil change at.""  So, off to Midas I went.

I got there, they pull my car into the garage and raise it up.  They look at it for a little bit, and then begin talking shit about &lt;instant oil change place&gt; for the rest of the time I was there.  They claim that &lt;instant oil change place&gt; stripped it (rounded? I forget the word they used) by using the wrong kind of wrench on it.. The mechanic says he'll get it off, just give him a couple minutes.

Well, a couple minutes later, they come back and continue to insist that &lt;instant oil change place&gt; over-tightened it, and they tell me they cannot get it off right now.  They want me to come back monday so they can weld a nut to the drain plug and use that to loosen it. They tell me that the entire oil pan/container/whatever may need to be replaced as well.  The manager says ""I know my guys here, and &lt;mechanic's name&gt;'s the one that worked on your car. I know him and he would NEVER tighten a drain plug that much,"" among other things blaming &lt;instant oil change place&gt; for everything.

So basically, they're saying that an instant oil change place that makes their money doing oil changes are the ones that over-tightened my drain plug (despite Midas being the last people to touch it) BEFORE even giving me an oil change.. Not sure why they expect me to believe that.

I'm just curious, do I have any options here? Am I going to just have to do what they say, or is there a better way to go about this?  I'm quite irritated right now, as Midas seems to be the worst thing to happen to my car.  I'd like to get all this fixed, but if the cost ends up being on me I'm going to be very annoyed, as I don't do a goddamn thing to my own car, since I don't know enough to feel comfortable around it.",,False,,t5_2tkvu,False,,,True,t3_xnon0,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/xnon0/midas_botched_an_oil_change/,

It's been a very nice and reliable car, no complaints there. It is the first brand new car either of us have owned and Wife's first car ever, so I've been pretty religious about keeping things in order. I have a journal in the glove box where I record every oil change, maintenance interval, brake change, tire change, service issue, etc, and because it seemed like a fun thing to do we also record every gas fill-up and the resulting mileage we got from it.

I always use synthetic oil in the car, the filter is replaced at every change, and I've even got a FilterMag on the oil filter. Every maintenance interval has been hit; the car currently has about 67k miles on it and I just had the serpentine belt and the front struts replaced and the cooling system flushed and refilled. Roughly every 4k miles I pour a bottle of fuel system cleaner into the gas tank, and once a year I pour a bottle of dry gas in there. Nicks and scratches get cleaned and touched up. The car is regularly washed and at least once a year (typically just after spring begins so as to get the winter salt out of the carpet), and sometimes also in mid-autumn) I have the interior completely cleaned and detailed. I've got WeatherTech custom molded mats in the car (which are awesome, btw). Any failed parts get repaired or replaced immediately.

What I'm wondering is, is there anything else I should be doing to keep the car in good order.

It's at 110K miles and the car has been running good so far. I never push it to its limit unless I'm about to be late for work.

One thing I noticed for awhile though is that after a short drive (maybe 10 minutes) and parking the car, I notice some heat radiating on the front driver side panel and side door after stepping out. The temps are normal on the gauge. I dont use the heater or AC at all. So what could be causing this heat?

I also noticed that during rainy or shower season, a light visible steam would just emit off of the hood when I'm at a stop or parked... I'm just thinking it's probably a cold layer burning off the top of the hood or something. I dont see any heat or smoke coming out from the inside of the hood.

I'm a AAA member, so I had them come out and they replaced my battery. Their replacements come with a 2 year warranty.


Yesterday, I drove 15 minutes out to get some stuff from Wal-Mart and when I tried to start the car nothing happened. I called out AAA and the guy had no idea what he was doing - he tested it three times and eventually said my alternator was dead and I needed a tow. He said because my alternator was dead I voided the warranty.


I got up today and called the repair shop I got it towed to. They said the alternator was just fine and that the battery was just dead, with no other problems with the car. We had a AAA guy come out again and he said this time that my terminal was dead and that we had to get a new terminal to replace the battery under warranty. The repair shop took a look at the terminal and said it was just fine and that it was just the battery that needed replacing. The AAA guy said he'd go get me a terminal and would be back in 20 minutes.


3 hours later, we call up AAA and they send me a third technician. This time, he tests the battery as a failure and calls in to get me my warranty. Their office then tells me I only drove the car 2000 miles since the last battery was put in and that by doing so I voided my warranty. Further, because there was corrosion when they originally replaced the battery I never had a warranty to start. They then hung up and the technician left.


My repair shop replaced the battery with an IB and I'm now out $200 and a day of work. AAA refuses to take my calls. I'm asking here because I want to know - is this a unique situation? I've been a member for 30 years and never missed a payment and only called on their roadside services 3 times in those years, and now I feel like every one of my membership payments were for nothing. I want to fight them on this, but I have no idea whether or not I actually did something wrong to legitimately void the warranty and render their services useless.

I checked the A/C drain hose coming out of the firewall to make sure it wasn't melting on the downpipe, and that checked out with no problems.  Searching on NASIOC and other Subaru forums has given me a boatload of different possibilities, but none seem to be a probable cause for my situation.

Is it a blown head gasket?

Okay so we took the valve cover and the head off. The head gasket seems intact, and we think the head may be warped; we also find that one of the plugs won't come out, is stuck in the head, reinforcing our theory about the warped head. The most bizarre development came when I drained by oil and took the filter off -- **my oil filter that I've had on for four thousand miles is perfectly clean, no sign of oil inside, is practically brand new**. I know for a fact that oil is continuing to circulate throughout the engine, as the oil leakage is up around the head gasket, and when the valve cover was removed, there was oil pooling around the rocker arms: this leads me to believe that the oil pump is functioning.

1. It's not driven very often (maybe a few miles every two or three weeks).

2. It's relatively high mileage at around 165k miles.

4. I live in GA and although we're approaching the end of winter soon, the temperature can drop below freezing.

A coworker who is somewhat more knowledgeable told me to use 5Wx40 and a bottle of Lucas sealant. I work at an auto parts distributor (in IT, I'm not very knowledgeable about cars myself), and when I put the order in with someone they balked at using synthetic 5Wx40.

I have read that it's generally not a good idea to change transmission fluid in a high-mileage vehicle without proper maintenance documentation, but I didn't read this until after the fact.  I drained about 3 quarts and re-filled to the proper level with Valvolene DEX/MERC (not Mercon V) high-mileage, but now it feels like I don't have the acceleration I had previously.

Details inside...",nexoner,12,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1kbczx/misfiring_on_cylinder_3_02_pontiac_aztek_any/,"Ok, this is going to be kind of long.  Normally with a misfire first thing I'd think is sparks/coils/wiring, but with the stupid Aztek half the plugs are damn near inaccessible on the back of the motor.  There are a myriad of problems I've had in the past with this damn car but for now, it's all I've got.  So, a little back story:


I spent last summer working in Iowa during that crazy dust bowl heatwave.  I was driving around 1400-2100 miles a week for work, blew a head gasket and had some shady shop in S IL drop in a salvage motor that was apparently from a Silhouette.  


When I got the car back the entire gauge cluster was completely dead, and their response was it was not their fault but for another grand I could have them fix it.  Yeah, no thanks guys was my answer.  So I drove it without gauges for a few weeks and went home to NY.  After I got home I let it sit undriven for a few weeks and the battery died.  Well wtf, when I got a jump the damn cluster comes back to life!  



Also, about 2 days after I got the car back from them I started getting the CEL with a P0304 code indicating a misfire on cylinder 3.  It runs fine most of the time except when accelerating quickly, like on a highway on ramp.  It will kind of shudder and stumble but the second I take my foot off the gas it will go back to normal and I can resume acceleration fine, just a bit gimpy in the pickup dept.  Occasionally the CEL would start blinking which I took as a sign of imminent doom but then I'd hit the shoulder, turn the car off and on again and it would be fine again.  This happened a couple times on my way back from Iowa to New York and each time, hit shoulder turn off restart, golden.  Towards the end of the trip when I was closer to home I decided fuck it, I'll see what happens if I keep driving with this light blinking and oddly enough after about 30 seconds it goes back to solid and continues to drive just fine aside from the shudder during acceleration or sometimes going up hills.

I've read up a bit on it and it seems that it could be anything from the sparks to the fuel pump and on up to a cracked cylinder.  My question is, how much should I expect to pay to just get this bastard diagnosed?  I've been quoted anywhere from 400-600 for the sparks to be done due to the pain in the ass sideways positioning of the motor so I'd prefer not to go the ""replace stuff 'til it works"" route.  Is there a way for a shop to come up with a definitive answer for me without getting into a ton of billable hours?  Oh, also the battery does need replacement(I get the battery indicator every time I start the car,) is it even possible the battery replacement could fix it?

My car (2007 Acura TSX) has 80k miles and needs:

* new brakes (rotors and pads) all the way around 
* new rear shocks and struts? 
* two new rear tires  

I've had this confirmed by two separate shops.  The shocks are not leaking, just worn.  The rear tires have uneven wear from bad alignment (fixed but the damage was done.  The tread is still good though and I was told it was safe to drive) and I get vibration when I brake at high speeds.  

I was at a BBQ this weekend and was talking with a very nice guy who, when he overheard my troubles and my figuring it would cost around $2k all told, wanted to help me out.  He's a car buff who does restorations of old cars and wants to hook me up getting some parts at deep discounts and he offered to do the repairs for free or close to it.

I am obviously very grateful to him for his offer and don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth but I don't know if I'm taking on any undue risk.   

* Should I trust a guy I met at a BBQ to change my shocks?  I know lots of people do their own brakes so I guess I'm less skeptical there.
* I told him that safety is my #1 concern.  Is it possible for him to get quality struts for $87 each? He also quoted me $52 for front rotors, $20 rear rotors, $28 front ceramic brake pads and $22 rear ceramic brake pads.

TL;DR: i hit a deer and i was rear-ended.  my car won't pass state inspection because of the front passenger headlamp bracket breaking.  received crazy-high estimates - can i do this on my own?

First, thank you for taking the time to read my post.

The first estimate I received to fix *everything* totals $2,520.  this includes:

* Front Bumper Cover

* Replacing both Front Headlamps (even though only 1 has a broken bracket)

* Replace hood (it's a small dent - i'm hoping to try the compressed air/hair dryer trick.)

* Replace Rear Right Reflector

* Rear Bumper Cover

* a LOT of paint, clearcoat and paint/clearcoat labor attached (totalling about $900 of the $2,520 total)

Question 1: Is the paint really that necessary?  Or is it just to get it back to brand spanking new?

Question 2: Scions are known for their user-friendly modifications, is it reasonable to assume I might be able to replace the front bumper on my own?

Question 3: The part not passing the inspection is the passenger headlamp; the bracket snapped.  Would it pass inspection if I gorilla-glued the plastic back together?  It is otherwise functional.

Question 4: I found all of the parts cheaper online from what seems to be reputable sources (Scion parts, not body kits).. If it is ill-advised for me to attempt the bumper replacement on my own, would it insult a mechanic if I offered to buy the parts and only pay for the labor?

We live in Barstow, CA, south of the Mojave desert so I got the idea to charge my freon with my wife being pregant it would help her out in the 100+ degree weather. I bought a bottle (134a)that had a gauge. When I attached the gauge  it read out that it was almost below the green. So I followed the instructions and the gauge final reading was over half way but not in the red. I returned my bottle and got my deposit and went on my way.

I did notice a difference in the AC but it took a bit for it to kick in in comparison to before the charge but I thought it might be because it was just newly charged.

I didn't use the AC for a couple of days because we traveled to a cooler environment but then coming back we turned the AC and cold air was just barley being pushed out.  I attached the gauge on the nozzle to check the pressure and it was all the way in the red! I didn't want to drain out any freon but some kept coming out when I put the attachment out and the attachment wouldn't stay on for long.

I feel really bad and stupid because my wife now has busted AC and will only go to our mechanic about 200 miles away in 2 weeks to fix it and won't trust local mechanics. Is there a fix I might be able to do? I plan in the mean time to to find a mechanic locally and try to talk my wife into going to them and hopefully they don't charge an arm and a leg.

TL;DR I broke the A/C in my pregnant wife's car when it's 100+ degrees outside. I need help fixing it myself since our mechanic is over 200 miles away and won't go see him for another 2 weeks.

Solution: took car to Auto shop. They are charging 65 to evac and replace the freon. Ill follow up here when I have the car back.

Back story:  My husband has had his 1993 GMC Sierra K1500 5.7L truck since 2002.  Naturally, over the past year, it has started to require some attention.  

It was running wonderfully until I had to drive it for a week last August after my own car was stolen.  There's a nice, long running joke.... ;)

In any event, we recently moved and my husband and I have been unable to locate his old paperback Haynes and Chiltons since the move.  I'm sure they will turn up but in the meantime, I was thinking of making one of these subscriptions a small part of his Father's Day gift.

Some intial questions, thoughts, and things I've noticed about these services:

* The Amazon reviews for eautorepair.net aren't that great upon first  glance, but as I read the specific reviews, I note that they are mainly complaints about lack of information for unpopular makes/models. Am I ok assuming that no matter who I sign up with, there will be a generous amount of information for his 1993 GMC Sierra K1500?

* Do all of these services provide the same amount of information in general or do some cater to the more advanced DIY'er?

* Do the Chiltons and Haynes online services provide significantly more than their paperback versions?  In other words, if we find the paperbacks within a week or two after getting the online subscription, will he still benefit from the online service?  

I'd love to hear any information, comments, and/or opinions you have regarding these services.  Thank you in advance!",,False,,t5_2tkvu,False,,,True,t3_1fqq90,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1fqq90/help_me_choose_an_online_subscriptionbased_auto/,

Long-term prognosis question.",fatmanjogging,11,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1fnhfu/1999_s10_with_226000_miles_longterm_prognosis/,"Hi everyone. I have a 1999 S10 (base model, 2.2L 4 cyl., 5 speed, RWD) with 226,000 miles. Starting around the 200,000 mile mark, I've done the following:

- Replaced clutch (the whole ball of wax, including new flywheel, pressure plate, master and slave, throwout bearing, etc.)
- Replaced alternator and battery
- Replaced various suspension/steering components, including idler arm, ball joints, tie rod ends, and new shocks all around, complete with an alignment and fresh tires
- Replaced catalytic converter
- Replaced exhaust front pipe
- Replaced front wheel bearings and seals
- Replaced rear axles, did a differential flush, and replaced seals
- Replaced fuel filter a year ago
- Replaced plugs 12 months ago and 18 months before that
- Did a thorough flush and replaced dexcool with regular antifreeze about 18 months ago.
- Did the brakes and rotors about 30,000 miles ago

Work that still needs to be done before safety and emissions inspections in November:

- New muffler (current one - the original - has a small hole or tear and makes a somewhat loud noise. Will probably not pass inspection) and possibly tailpipe, depending on how easily the two can be separated

Work that I've been putting off for a few years:

- A/C is blowing hot air, charging doesn't help.

Though I've had it for 13 years, I honestly didn't intend to put this much time, effort - or in the case of repairs I didn't do myself, money - into the vehicle over the last few years. As I'm guessing many of us have encountered, you fix one thing and two more pop up, leading into a rabbit hole where you're constantly referencing hindsight and deciding you wouldn't get rid of the vehicle because you've put so much into it now.

Anyway, realistically, the thing runs fine at the moment. It's loud (muffler), hot (lack of a/c), and like any vehicle with that many miles, has its quirks. 

So here's my question: what would you do with this vehicle? Selling it 30,000 miles ago isn't an option. My current financial situation doesn't allow for another car payment, but that will hopefully change in a few months. But when I do reach that point, what would you do? Get rid of it immediately? Hang onto it as a second vehicle for weekend warrior-type activities? Or keep it as a daily driver until it falls apart? 

FWIW, I'm changing the oil every 3,000 miles, using Valvoline MaxLife 5W30 during cooler months and 10W30 during warmer months. Also, per the suggestion of the mechanic I use, I'm adding about 1/3 to 1/2 a can of Sea Foam to the crank case with each oil change. I have noticed that I'm burning less oil since doing this.

How much more can I realistically expect from this truck?",,False,,t5_2tkvu,False,,,True,t3_1fnhfu,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1fnhfu/1999_s10_with_226000_miles_longterm_prognosis/,

I rotated the crankshaft via the crankshaft dampener bolt and noticed considerable scoring on the back side of cylinder #1's rod journal. Which is also the cylinder I suspect piston slap from.

I had been getting a ""misfire cyl 6"" engine code.  
  
After pulling the fuel rail, I inspected the injector on #6. It wan't visibly damaged, and the electrical resistance was nominal (14Ω, same as the others). I decided to replace all the O-rings on the injectors I pulled, and swap injectors #4 and #6. This way, if the CEL comes back with a cylinder 4 misfire, I'll know to replace the injector.  
  
Yesterday I put the whole thing back together. I turned the key to ""on"" (not ""ignition"") 3 or 4 times to prime the fuel pump. After one failed attempt, I had successful ignition and took a spin around the block. No CEL yet, and the engine ran considerably smoother than before, but still with a bit of a rough idle.  
  
Today, it doesn't start at all. When I key to ignition, I just hear a *click*, and then nothing happens. I charged the battery and even tried with it hooked up to a 75A charger/power source, no change. This is the same behavior I had in my one failed attempt above.  
  
One thing I was worried about was the ""union bolt"", [circled here in red](http://i.imgur.com/2xFUqIp.png). It has a transverse hole through its middle, which I'm guessing is supposed to be oriented towards the fuel pipe so the fuel can flow into the rail. I tried to ensure this is the case by counting the turns, but obviously I can't see this part when it's tightened. I didn't disassemble the fuel pressure regulator; the only other bolts I removed were the two circled in blue, which gave me enough room to lift the rail off the injectors.
  
**Symptoms:**  

* When I key to ""on"", I hear the fuel pump (I think) briefly make a noise sequence for ~5 seconds. I can't remember if I have ever heard this before I started working on the engine, so I don't know if it's normal.
* When I key to ""ignition"", I hear a pronounced *click* and then nothing.  
* Ran yesterday with a somewhat rough idle, no CEL after ~1.5 miles. Hesitant acceleration was noticeably reduced from before.  
  
Any suggestions?

Eventually the terminal on the battery cable cracked in half and I was forced to replace the cable. At that point I realized that the bolt and nut holding the terminal in place wasn't actually coming loose, but rather my constant (over)tightening caused the terminal to crack.

Now, two years later, the same thing is happening again. I am not tightening the bolt any longer, just giving the cable a bit of a wiggle. That's enough to get the car going again. So my questions are:

1. What exactly is going on here? It's as if the stress of running or starting the engine is stretching/loosening the terminal just enough.

2. Before I need to replace the cable again, what are my repair alternatives? Is there maybe a sleeve-type washer that I can put over the battery terminal to increase its girth a little, thus allowing the cable terminal a little more to grab on to?

I thought it was must be something with muffler, and I'd need to replace it.

I brought it in this morning, and they said my flange gasket between the catalytic converter and intermediate pipe needs replacing. This is what is causing the sound.

They said it's a tough thing to replace (not verbatim, but something like that) and would like to replace the catalytic converter and intermediate pipe as well.

I looked online, and read that a catalytic converter can last the life of the vehicle. (100,000 miles, 160,000 km). The vehicle has 170 KM right now. However, I read alot about what used catalytic converters can be sold for because of their previous metals, and wonder if this is a 'recommended' thing often because of it. 

Obviously no one here can say for sure without seeing it, but from what I'm being told the flange gasket is necessary, and the other two are not. I'm assuming a new CC is quite expensive, and is maybe just being recommended because the used one can be sold for a decent price because of the metals inside. 

How long should a catalytic converter last?

**Car:**  1994 BMW 325i (Convertible)


**Engine:**  2.49L 6cyl DOHC 24V (Gasoline)


**Transmission:** Automatic


**Mileage**: 146k


**Description of Problem**

--------------

The car sounds and drives fine at speeds &lt;45 MPH.

It can reach and maintain speeds of &gt;80 MPH for brief moments, usually longer in the beginning.  The symptoms first occur after traveling on the interstate for three miles to fifteen miles.

When the car fails to maintain its speed when traveling &gt;45 MPH, the car sounds and travels as if the driver removed their foot from the accelerator.  RPM appears to remain constant. Car appears to have a slight burning smell. The car resumes acceleration in series of “pulses” ranging to a few seconds to a few minutes. When the car returns from the interstate after car trouble, the car resumes normal operation. 

We have not noticed any spots of fluid when the car is parked.

The car appears to not exhibit any other issues currently.

The car is a recent purchase, previous work is unknown.

Edit 1: The check engine light comes out when the car begins misbehaving. I remember it only staying on during the problem.

---------
My assumption is it is related to the transmission, but I have limited amounts of experience with cars. I'm unsure if the transmission fluid is low or not, this particular model advertises a ""lifetime transmission fluid."" I found it kind of odd that RPM did not seem to jump when these problems occurred while it sounded as if my foot was removed from the pedal. 

Also, the owner recently found that the owners manual request that you use premium gas. The car has not been tested since switching from regular to premium gas. Does it make a dramatic difference?

Thanks for the help in advance, my friend has been worked up about the car. I was hoping to get some advice for her :)

About 4 weeks ago on a long road trip I noticed that occasionally at speeds above 100 KM/hr my steering wheel would start shaking like as if I had a tire that was out of balance. At the same time I also noticed that I was experiencing brake judder when touching the brakes at high speed. I should mention that only the wheel shakes, I don't believe I've ever felt anything on the brake pedal.

Here's the kicker: both of these symptoms will randomly disappear and reappear **together**. Sometimes the shaking will be pretty intense, especially under braking, but most of the time it's not as bad. Sometimes the steering wheel will shake when braking at low speeds (50-60KM/hr) but most of the time it doesn't (it did tonight).

Things I've ruled out:

* Warped rotors: I checked the lateral run-out on the front disks, they were both less than 0.001"" (the Mazda service manual says anything under 0.002"" is acceptable).
* Unbalanced tires: The problem persisted when I swapped the front tires with the rears. Just to be extra sure it wasn't the new tires, I put my front winter tires on and verified that the problem still occurred.
* Crappy roads: On the same stretch of road, I've had the problem one day and the next day it's fine.
* (maybe) Wheel bearings: I ruled it out because don't hear any grinding/roaring noises.
* Loose lug nuts/axle nuts/suspension hardware: Everything's torqued to the recommended values in from the service manual.

Here are all the things I replaced in the last few months:

* Brakes: calipers, rotors, and pads
* Front control arms
* Inner and outer tie rod ends
* Rear struts
* Tires: 4 new Hankook brand

The front struts were changed but I have no idea when, they looked pretty new when I bought the car (3 years and ~40K KM ago). They're not the best and TBH they are starting to feel a bit mushy but they definitely don't feel/sound worn-out.

I should also mention that about a year ago I replaced the right front steering knuckle/bearing/hub with a used part from a junk yard because the wheel bearing went bad. I don't have access to a press so it was easier just to buy the whole unit and slap it on.

The car was aligned right after I replaced the control arms and tie rods, which was a few weeks before the problem started. After that it drove better than it ever had.

My current theory is the front strut mounts, but I know it's a hell of a stretch...

Please help =/



UPDATE July 18, 2012:

* As per MisterTactful's recommendation, I checked the front hubs with a stethoscope for noise while the wheels were turning at ~70KM/hr and the noise was the same on both sides (no grinding!).

We were stuck somewhere a few months ago and called a tow truck to haul it to our usual shop. But when the guy came, he started it right up, as if there were no problems whatsoever. We took it to the shop ourselves and they looked it over, but since they could not reproduce the problem, they couldn't say for sure what was happening. One guy suspected the fuel pump, but there was no evidence of anything bad, so we didn't do anything.

Well, this morning it's happening again. cranks, starts briefly (I think), then it's back to cranking.

Does anyone have an opinion about what it could be? I'm getting to the point that if several people have the same opinion, I'm just going to have it fixed, whether it seems fine when we take it to the shop or not.

I'm a bit suspicious since all the extra weights added to counter the buckle are directly opposite where the machine has damaged the alloy.

I'm not planning on taking the whole car apart, I just want to be able to do things like changing the oil, repairing something small with a kit I keep in my apartment, and knowing enough about car talk not to get ripped off at the mechanic shop. I've seen enough computer people rip off enough non-computer people to know how this works.

They sent me a PDF listing everything they found from the diagnostics and what they want to do with the brakes. I took a basic auto class in college and have done a few minor repairs on my car before so I don't know a lot but I do know somethings. 


When I read the PDF I was a little confused about some of the things they listed - especially R&amp;R. Since it is an old car (blue book value is about $2,000) and the cost to repair everything would be just under $2,000 I am trying to decide what is necessary to repair and what isn't. It really is just my commuter car now. I drive to work which is 4 miles away and in the city. I am starting to bike more as well so I will drive the car 3 times a week and then everyday when winter rolls around. 


Some of the things they listed that I don't understand are:


R&amp;R evap solenoid,and canister (Diag 1 hr found that
evap canister and evap solenoid is broken and wire is broken)


R&amp;R drums and shoes and hardware (found that rear
brakes drums and shoes are bad) - I get the drums part. I just don't know what R&amp;R means.


R&amp;R filter and gasket (Trans pan is leaking)


Replace fuel filter (Fuel filter appears original) - I plan on just replacing this one myself.


Replace oil pan gasket (Found engine oil seep)


Replace both front sway-bar links (Found sway-bar link(s)
worn/loose)


Perform power steering system fluid exchange service
(Found power steering fluid is discolored)


So I don't know if any of you would be able to help me out to figure out what is really important or what I can get by without.

I have a hole in the rubber elbow connector, shown in the picture below my conveniently pointed finger (forgive me I have no idea what that rubber elbow is called).

http://i.imgur.com/vtgkLh1.jpg


 I put tape around it realizing that it was probably creating a nasty vacuum leak and tried to drive to the dealership close by to get the part real quick. That definitely ended prematurely. 

While driving everything was fine until at one point I accelerated and when I let my foot off the pedal the car KEPT ACCELERATING. It was an uncomfortable experience, I can assure you. So I cut my losses and abruptly turned around to go back home.

 It seemed to be fixed some of the time when I would put my foot behind the pedal and pull it up, and sometimes I would just have to weather the storm and mash the brake pedal to keep from taking this fine Chicago made stallion through someones quaint suburban house.

So if anyone has any idea why my car is sudenly accelerating even when my foot is off the pedal please let me know. 


**Particulars that might influence possible theories**:

Just replaced IAC valve

Just replaced PCV hosing assembly

have gorilla tape as temporary measure around elbow joint in picture

Check engine light will flash when it's bad, then remain steady. Before it was un-driveable, I would get a flashing, then steady soft code (went back out after 30 or so miles)

I just think its too much of a coincidence that the fuel pump and power disconnected/stopped working at the exact same time and want to see if maybe something else is going on.

Thanks in Advance.

I was removing the spark plugs and 1-3 come out no problem. 4 was tough and I leaned into it, and pop, the nut shaped portion and plug along with all the ceramic comes right out. 

I am now left with the threads still in the head and I am at a bit of a loss as how to proceed. 

It is an easy car to work on.  In-line 4 and the whole hood/bonnet lifts in a way as you can really get to work on it. 

I would prefer not to have to remove the head and have it drilled out, I am pretty broke, but I understand that may be necessary. If so any tips on that would be greatly appreciated.

A few days back my parents car was running very rough at start up. Shut it down, checked oil level (was a hint low, topped it off), had my dad take it to work (about a 25 mile drive, backroads and then highway). He mentioned it was running fine, but he had to make a stop on the way. During which, when started again after being warm, it was misfiring badly and basically undrivable. Tried shutting it down and starting, eventually it worked itself out and ran normally. This continued the next day as well; on cold starts it was alright, but warm starts it would misfire.

 I checked all the coil packs and spark plugs (all were replaced within a year's time), all the coil packs were fine and firing as normal. Warmed the car up to recreate the problem and checked the coils again, found that the ones on cyl 2, 3 and 5 seemed to not be receiving any power from the harness.

I'm a mechanically incompetent gal who needs some advice about her car.  I bought my 1992 Buick Century nearly five years ago, and until recently, I haven't had any issues with it.  I'd only done standard replacements (i.e. brakes, muffler, tires).  Over this past winter, my car wouldn't start.  I had it towed by AAA and had the alternator replaced.  All seemed fine and dandy, until about a week later, when it wouldn't start again.  I had it towed (AGAIN) by AAA, and had the battery replaced.

Since then, I've been having some more problems.  One morning shortly after I had the battery replaced, it was extra cold and rainy, and guess what!? My car wouldn't start!  I tried again on a less rainy, less cold day, and it started.  From what I've deduced, it seems like this could be spark plugs? Or maybe moisture under the distributor cap?  My dad suggested that I get a fuel additive and some fresh gas (I live in Chicago, and I drive very little), so I did, and things have been fine.

Over the past 24 hours, a few weird things have also happened.  Yesterday, my turn signal randomly stopped working.  I have no idea why this could have happened, but I think there may be some sort of electrical something or other with the steering column (since what happened this morning was even more weird and related to the steering column).

This morning (mild temperature, mild drizzle), I was getting in my car, started it, all seemed fine.  I parallel park on my street.  My spot was kind of tight, so I put the car in reverse and turned the wheel sharply to the left (I parked on the left side of a one-way street) so I could start working my way out.  However, as I was turning the wheel, my engine died, and my ""service engine soon"" light turned on (for the first time since I've had the car!).  The weirdest part was that my key was stuck in the ignition? It would not turn all the way back to the position where I could remove it.  I moved the wheel back and forth to see if there was a ""sweet spot"" or something where the key would turn.  No dice.  I'm getting really annoyed.  

I then decided to put the car in neutral, then back in park, and that worked to release the key.  From then, I tried to see if my car would turn on again, it did, and it all seemed normal again.  However, I decided not to take it to work, since I have an appointment after work in the suburbs. I don't want to get stuck with no way home, so I'm going to have someone give me a ride.  I also didn't want to mess with it anymore since I was going to be late to work.

Sorry for the essay.  This car stuff has been really annoying.  I've already spent way more money on my car recently that I would have liked, and I don't have much extra cash for repairs.  I was going to take a trip home to have my mom's boyfriend help with a tune up, since he is good with cars and it will be much cheaper, but I'm not sure if I trust my car on a 200 mile trip right now.

Anybody have some suggestions for what I should do? Thank you!

99 mustang cobra, t-45 transmission. about 65k miles on the current clutch.  I rebuild the engine 20k miles ago and did the install myself. No problems there.  When my clutch is completely let out there is a repetitive ""shck shck shck"" sound. when there is light tension on the pedal it goes away.  ALSO; when the clutch is fully disengaged (pedal to the floor) I get the same sound. These noises happen regardless of whether I'm in gear or not (clutch engaged) but disappear with light pressure on the pedal or an inch from the firewall.

It's still engaging the clutch in the same place, still grabbing, no slipping or burning.  I want to believe my cable is loose or frayed/breaking which is causing the clutch lever to rub on the cable cover or bell housing.  The cable cover might be a little loose as it's held on with some flimsy screws compared to the rest of the vehicle. 

I haven't had the time to get under it and check but wanted some hypothesizing first!

Me and a buddy changed it out, I did a coolant flush and everything was peachy. So proud! 

But, as I have been driving it the past couple of days, I noticed that the idle was really low when I was at a stop. Like, close to dying. Idle in park was fine, so I figured no big deal I will adjust it a little. I noticed that when I turned the car on, the check engine light would come on when the sensors from the air filter were unplugged. Re-plugging the sensors and undoing the neg battery terminal cleared the light.

Well, I first tightened up the throttle cable a bit, but I found out this is the wrong way to adjust the idle, as the car thinks you are accelerating and won't let you shift from park. I then gave a tiny turn to the idle adjustment screw. I also sprayed carb cleaner into the throttle and into the IACV opening. 

Now, the engine when started will ""pulse"". Not really the ""bouncing idle"" problem that is very common, where it will go from ~800 rpm up to ~1200 and back down... No, this sounds like it almost misfiring or something, like chugging or pulsing. Also, there is a bit of white smoke now coming from the exhaust. Lastly, the check engine light is on and will not clear. Obviously it is something I have done in the throttle body but I am at a loss. I haven't checked the code to see what it is, but I thought I'd try here first to see if anyone could point me in the right direction.

I'm more worried about the little bit of smoke and water coming from the tailpipe. I just finished the head gasket and I'm worried that I did something crazy and it is already having problems again. It's not a lot of smoke and it almost seems like it could be just steam or condensation as it is not a cloud...

Paid him Tuesday, Picked it up Friday.

When I first turned the key I look up at my road indicator it says my coolant is low, I check it and not a drop in the reservoir so I put some in. Later that day Im sitting in the TacoBell drivethru waiting in line and I notice the temp gauge starts surpassing the middle something that never happened before. I pull over to the side and I hear this weird rumbling. I open the hood and my coolant is boiling. I let it sit and wait for the temp to return to normal so I can make it home. Saturday morning I go out to start the car and it wont start. I call AAA they give me a jump start and it works after driving it around for about 45 minutes I turn it off. Come back 15 minutes later no start. I call the shop tell about the car not starting. They tell me to call AAA and have it towed.  I dont have anymore calls for AAA. Sunday I get a jump from a neighbor it works thinking maybe I didnt let it run long enough for the battery to charge last.Since I have no tows I want to drop it off at the shop. I drive around for 30 minutes bring it home and decide to let it run outside so it can charge. Im sitting on my porch and hear BOOM! then all this coolant drops out of the bottom smoke billows. I run to turn the engine off look at the dash, temperature is at the max. I pop the hood a reservoir that was fairly low looks full stick my finger in it and doesn't look like coolant at all it has a watery consistency and is  light brown. Look at my radiator and looks like a chunk of it is [broken off](http://i.imgur.com/30R7FgB.jpg).
My mother says my car is toast and that I've blown a head gasket. They were supposed to have my car in working condition they sent me on my way with out even testing it or letting it run because if they did they would have known the car was overheating. I called the shop told them what happened and they're coming to pick it up now. 

Just looking for some advice on what I should do. What do you think happened. Is my car done? Should ask for my $900 back or the value of my car if it is totaled? Idk I use my car for work so Its really hurting my pockets.

(SIDE NOTE TO ALL OF THIS : I checked my fuses when I got my car back because my horn wasn't working it always did before. Check the fuses under the hood and my horn fuse is missing. And not sure because I never looked before but where the fuse key says there should be fuses for the Front O2 sensor and rear O2 sensor there is none.)

* Steering wheel vibration starting at about 100-105km/h
* Wandering, worse than normal reactions to crosswinds
* Tracking (not sure of the term) along ruts
* Faint but audible clunk when turning the wheel at low speed
* Car seems to surge when braking (like it's pulsing back and forth)
* Vibration seems to die down if I'm turning right
* Not sure if related, but power steering pump seems to be louder than normal

And here's what I've ruled out so far:

* Tie rods - Inner and outer on both sides are new
* Brakes - Also new pads and discs
* Tires - No noise, front set just balanced
* Ball joints - One side just replaced, other side has no play or visible wear

And what I think it could be:

* Steering rack play. Clunking noise is audible, and you can see some play when shaking the wheel from 9/3, although this only happens from the left side. Right side has no similar play or noise
* Lower control arm(s), can't tell which side since I have no pry bar or suitable substitute
* Upper strut mounts (doubt that it would cause wheel shimmy)

Am I missing anything? Thoughts?

**[UPDATE - 11/03/13]** - Just got back from having the wheels rebalanced, so now the wheel stops shimmying if I point it in a certain direction. Otherwise, it's just like before.

I'm looking at a busted crankshaft.

The bang was the shaft breaking.

The rear section, still hooked to the transmission was forced to rotate against the forward section.  

The slipping of these two broken parts over each other is what caused the shaking.

This forced the front section of the shaft forward, and it escaped the only way it could: out of the front of the timing cover.

It seems to be connected to my speed and is most noticeable at right around 35mph. At higher speeds its still there but far less noticeable. I have had the tires balanced, rotated, and aligned. The tires are a few years old but the tread still looks pretty good. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like there is something small stuck to one of the tires that is just barely big enough for me to notice it.

Edit: I took this picture this morning. Might it be my issue?

I am not a metal/gear head.  Understand the principles, but that's about as far as it goes.

I'm looking to buy a Class 'A' motor-home (1990-2000) and have noticed that they all generally use 'big-block' Chevy or Ford V8 or V10s.  Some have Cummins diesels coupled to Allison transmissions.

My question centres around 'What constitutes 'high mileage for these engines?' which could be refined to 'At what mileage does one start to see problems that need attention?'.  Do things change with a diesel engine and Allison transmission?

I had a Kia and at close to 100,000kms it was starting to show its age a little, but it was only a 1.6l.  An RV has caught my eye with I think a Cummins diesel and Allison transmission - it has 155,000km (1992); but I have no idea whether or not this is 'lots' for such components.

Basically, I have no idea about how things scale up when you get into serious metal.

Thanks - much appreciate it...

Edit:  Wow!  Thank you so much for your help here people.  As it turns out the unit I was looking at was a scam.  An identical picture was used for a unit 5,000km away from me in Nova Scotia with near identical specs except for fewer kms and a higher price.  I used 'Google Image Search' to discover this after I had an email back from the seller that indicated the unit was in a warehouse and 'would be delivered to me, the cost of shipping and handling include in the price and that a 'third party would be used to channel payments'.  Yeah.  Right  :)

So, obviously disappointed but your help here has been invaluable and as such has probably directed my search now away from gas v8's and v10's and so will focus on finding something with a diesel powerplant.  On the one hand this has made my search easier and taken out a lot of questions, but at the same time has made it harder as it's now more specific  :)

I've got more input here than I hoped for and really appreciate it - thank you for your time and effort.",,False,,t5_2tkvu,1361208702.0,,,True,t3_18pthf,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/18pthf/need_help_understanding_bigblocks_in_class_a/,

About 2 weeks ago just as I was leaving for work I turned on my car and it immediately died. The day is likely significant because it had dropped to below freezing from 50-60 degrees and had rained/sleeted. In the past I had some stuttering problems after it had rained but never this bad. Next morning the car worked fine and since than I've made sure to let it warm up for a good 10-15 minuets before driving any where. 

Couple days later while driving on the highway the accelerator gave out, engine was still running because I could coast to an exit but I was able to get it started and accelerated somehow, I just can't remember how I did it. Filled up my fuel tank to full and didn't have a problem until today.

Rained pretty hard during the night and morning. When I left I was able to go maybe 1/4 mile when I came to a stop the engine died. Started again right away but no acceleration and after about 15 ft of coasting in reverse the engine cut out again. This time it took about 10 minutes of turning the car on and off before the engine would stay on for more then half a second. What was odd was I was finally able to get the engine to start by accelerating while turning the car on, but as soon as I was ready to move the car the acceleration wasn't working and I had to coast home.

I should warn that I know nothing about cars and as a broke college student I'm really looking for what might be wrong so I can tell if I can afford to fix it. Thanks for any help.

It first happened right after Thanksgiving and has now happened twice since (three times total).

End of November I came outside after work one night and did what I do every night. I pressed lock on my fob (lights flashed) and held down the start button on the fob for the factory remote start. Nothing happened. I thought maybe I was out of range, so I tried again as I got closer to the car. Nothing. Got to the car, nothing. Opened the door with the key (which usually sets off the alarm), nothing. Put the key in, nothing. Key was stuck. Played with it for over an hour until some combination of the key turning and the headlights being turned on manually worked. Drove to dealership and they said they can't diagnose it if it's not broken, and it would cost me $130. I left.

Flash forward to last Tuesday the 15th. I started the car, which had sat all day Monday (stayed home sick), so it was idle not started for 36+ hours, no issues. Drove &lt;5 minutes to Target to get some cold medicine. As I was walking out of the store I pressed lock, and held remote start for 3 seconds. I did not have line of sight when I did it, but I was only about 100ft away so it should have started. When I could see the car, it was not started. Same story as before, fob didn't work, key stuck, etc. Headlight switch did not work, tired many times. Called GM roadside to get a tow to the dealership since it was in the broken state and they could then fix it, as they told me last time.

Tow truck showed up (1.5 hours later than the 1.5 hour estimate I was given), but couldn't tow me because there were too many other cars surrounding me, so he couldn't hook up. I explained what it was doing and he said it sounded like the battery was dead. We hooked up to his truck (to my posts under hood, since key was stuck and trunk release didn't work) and I tried starting it. Nothing. Flicked the headlights on manually, and it started. Disconnected, shut if off, started fine, no issues. Drove it to the dealership (same one as last time) and they said the same thing, not broke, can't fix it. I left it with them to see if they could get it to reproduce. They called later and said they couldn't, but charged me ~$65 for an electrical diagnosis that found no issues..

Today I was going to leave work and tried starting it from my office since it was so cold outside (-10F). I had line of sight through a window from about 100yds away but could see it flash lights when it was locking, but wouldn't start. Walked outside and was still 50yds+ away when I tried again. Pressed lock, lights flashed. Pressed remote start, nothing. Got to the car, noticed all the same symptoms described above (no dome light, no alarm, etc). I didn't put the key in because I didn't want it to get stuck. Called my dad, he came to try jumping it, since that seemed to work last time. Didn't. Hooked up to posts under hood and battery in the trunk. Nothing.

In frustration, I hit the dash right in the middle above the air vents and the headlights flashed, the horn honked and the dummy lights all flashed VERY briefly. Like a fraction of a second. I turned the key and the alarm started going off. Was able to start it, and alarm stopped. It was slow to turn over, but it had been sitting for 10+ hours in -10F, but battery didn't seem low, just cold. Drove it home, and it's fine now.

I know this is a lot of info, but it's getting very frustrating. I commute 35 miles to and from work each day and need the car to work. I work retail hours so there is a chance this could happen after work at midnight and I'd be more or less stuck there, 35 miles from home.

I thought from the start it was an anti-theft issue, but the dealer said it was the battery. I almost bought a new battery today, but didn't because it should have started when hooked to my dad's car if that was the problem.

Swapped my keyfob battery with my dad's and my battery worked in his remote, and his battery in mine didn't do anything at all. This was the first time the alarm went off when it started.

I think I covered everything, but I will surely answer any follow up questions.

2010 Chevy Cobalt LT Sedan, 51,800 miles.

Thanks in advance...

**EDIT 1/26** So this happened to me again today. Drove quite a bit yesterday, and it was in the upper single digits/lower teens for air temp. Car sat all night until about 11:15am. Started it remotely with fob, drove it about 20 miles to Mall of America and took the LRT to the Metrodome for TwinsFest. Car sat there from about 11:30am to maybe 3:30pm. Stopped off at the car to put some stuff in the trunk, and headed into the mall for a while. About 5pm we were walking back to the car and I had line of sight from about 150 feet away. I pressed lock, lights flashed. I held start and saw the taillights come on, heard the car turn over (remote starter activated) and the taillights went off. The car ""started"" but never actually ran. 

After this, it was dead as described above. Key stuck, no dome light, no dash lights, nothing. Headlights worked manually, taillights did not. Hazard lights did not work. If I pressed the ""i"" button in my radio, I could see the clock, but radio would not come on. I could eject the CD from the radio, and place it back in, but that was it. Nothing else electrical on the car worked at all. Luckily I found the key release button under the steering column so I didn't need to leave the keys in it at MOA.

Called my dad, who was unavailable at that moment, but luckily my roommate was free and brought some tools and my spare key. I thought maybe I would try the other fob/key to see if it was an issue with my main key not being recognized. It wasn't. I hooked up to his car with jumpers and after about 10 minutes of turning the key, engaging headlights, hitting the dash, etc (all the stuff that worked before...), the doors unlocked and all dash lights came on. Car started fine. Shut if off, started again. Took jumpers off and left it running.

This is now leading me to believe that the car battery may be the issue. I feel like it might be borderline OK so it works some days and if it gets just a hair too low, it basically shuts the car down. Once I charge it for a bit with jumpers, it starts and after running it for a while it charges up enough to work for a bit.

When I brought it to the dealership, he connected a box directly to the battery that looked similar to a code puller, but had alligator clamps on it. He pressed a few buttons and waited about a minute before saying the battery was a little low, but supposedly in the normal range. This was the second time it happened and I had driven it to the dealership, but only about 5 miles between when it was ""dead"" and when he checked it. It was only connected to the two truck for about 2 minutes that day, so not really enough time to get a good charge, but possibly just enough to start, and then start charging itself.

So I guess my plan at this point is to let the car sit overnight, take the battery out tomorrow and take it to an auto store to have them test the voltage on it. Not super thrilled about buying a new battery, but if it solves this issue, I'm game. Just don't want to get a new battery and have that not be the solution.

Three of the four times this has happened, it (eventually) started after being on jumper cables, albeit for a varying amounts of time (anywhere from 2 minutes to nearly an hour).

Whatever's causing this, it caused a pulsing feeling in the gear stick that was in sync with the whipping sound.

Potentially helpful: I just had an oil change this morning (new shop, since I'm relatively new to town), and they noted a few things that could use fixing. On the technician notes for the visual courtesy check, there are three comments: ""FR link broken, needs replacement,"" ""exhaust clamp loose,"" and ""intake system needs replacement."" Another part of the page lists the steering system as ""loose"". Might any of these be related to my car's brand new symptoms? I did not have any of these addressed today. I just did the oil change.

Thank you in advance. I'll try to provide any additional information that you might find helpful.

EDIT: Changed ""exhaust pump"" to ""exhaust clamp"", which is what the report actually says.

UPDATE: The sound is only present when coasting, whether in gear or not. No sound when idling or accelerating. It is very apparent inside the car but inaudible outside the car. The sound is similar to a helicopter.

UPDATE 2: Had the car serviced. The problem was identified as the right drive axle/sway bar link. These were replaced, but the noise is still present. The mechanic suggested that the problem may be in the trasmission.

Googling this concern only yielded me information on buying tires, which I don't believe is really going to help, so I'm turning to you, Reddit, to consult your hivemind of wisdom!  I drive a 1996 Honda Civic Coupe.  I've had her for about 4 years with no real problems that I wasn't able to repair myself.  That said, those were all pretty easy things on the spectrum of car maintenance.

A short while ago as I was pulling into the street it felt very much like I had a flat rear, passenger side tire.  I pulled over and hopped out to take a look, but the tire was fine.  I checked all four tires twice just to be sure, listening for a potential air leak.  Nothing.  I hopped back in, muted the music to listen, and moved the car forward slowly to see if I could pinpoint it.  

It felt as though my passenger side, rear tire was stuck in place, not spinning, and I was just dragging it.  After about half a block it began to roll properly.  Didn't feel any unusual pulling on the steering wheel and that end of the car ceased to pull awkwardly on the rest of the vehicle.

Sometimes when it gets cold I notice that my wheels don't spin as well as usual when I first get moving.  If I'm in neutral the car slows down noticeably without touching the brake.   Normally this issue goes away after a mile on the road when the car warms up a bit.  This morning was one of those cold mornings; didn't know if that might have any influence on the problem.

Couple of quick questions... 

1)  I just put new plugs in my truck as part of my troubleshooting its ignition
issues, which I was able to resolve via a carb rebuild.  However, once the engine started running, it ran extremely rich, until I properly tuned the carb.  This fouled up my plugs..they were jet black and grimy, and that caused me further issues.  Now, what I've read is that once they go black, they are garbage and should be replaced.  I don't want to have to replace my plugs every time this happens as I'd be going through them pretty quick while I learn how this all works.  I did clean them with carb cleaner and a #0000 steel wool, which seemed to return them to a reasonable state.  My friends say this is wrong of me and that I should replace the plugs no matter what.  I really dont want to do this....  I will replace the plugs one more time once I have the engine/carb tuned and whatnot, but not until then.  Am I wrong, or was I right to clean and re-use them for the time being?

2) I bought the plugs as a set of six from orielly.. just cheap copper ones... I didnt
check the gap, as they worked when I had installed them.  However, when I cleaned them I did check the gap, and they were all gapped at 0.031 (or about) but my truck calls for 0.043 - 0.046  -- so I used the gap tool and corrected for what the truck called for.   I thought the plugs would be pregapped and set for my rig from the box... am I supposed to be gapping my own plugs every time or what? Did I do the right thing by changing the gap to what my truck wanted? It seemd like a big difference.. and.. the truck ran (seemingly) fine with both 0.031 and the 0.043 gaps.     

EDIT:

3)  One more thing... I notice that on SOME cylinders, they were black and grimy, yet on two cylinders, they were whitish.. which from what I've read indicates those two cylinders were ran lean, and the black and grimy ones ran rich... how can this be??

Thanks for the advice...   :)

I have owned it for several years and never had any issues. I have kept up on scheduled maintenance. I was recently driving on the highway for about 20 minutes and the vehicle began rapidly shifting between gears, resulting in a very jolting ride. Eventually it got worse and stopped shifting at all. I got to where I was going and when I drove home later that night it late shifted a couple of times but eventually shifted normally. It late shifted a couple times the next day but then behaved normally during a short drive on city streets. 

The interesting thing is about 6 months ago I had an incident of late shifting under similar circumstances. All shifting problems stopped after that one time (until yesterday). At that time, I had a mechanic check it out and he found normal transmission fluid and he couldn't find anything else wrong. I had the transmission flushed and the filter replaced anyway. 

By the way I'm a recent graduate with tons of debt and start work in 4 days. So, no time or money and I don't want to be late my first day.  

It obviously seems like a transmission issue but why would the problem disappear for 6 months and come back out of no where? Is this a sign the the problem is progressive or just a random fluke? Does it sound like anything that has a simple fix? What is a very rough estimate of cost of repairs? 

Thanks.

Problem:

My car has a message console thing that has lights for assorted problems. Last week when I went to the library the traction control and ABS lights were on. My car has a switch for the traction control, so I tried switching it a few times, but nothing happened. (The light says ""trac off"" so I basically tried turning it on/off, the light stayed on).

The car hasn't been started again until today. The traction control and ABS lights were both off now. I tried switching the traction control on/off again. The light came on when I toggled the traction control, and then the light turned back off when toggled again. However, the fan settings (heating/cooling, where you want the air, and how much air) were unresponsive. The AC (I haven't turned it on since it stopped working) was stuck on and the front defroster was set as the air channel choice. I couldn't change the fan speed, desired temp, air channel, or toggle the AC. The air coming through was similar in temperature to the outside air (60-70F, quite cool).

When I turned the car on to come home there was no visual change, but the car started blowing pretty hot air instead of the before cool air. AC was still on etc. On the way back I noticed the gas gauge fluctuate from full-&gt;empty-&gt;full a few times. My tank is pretty full.

When I got home I popped the hood, took a quick look, didn't notice anything terribly wrong, and disconnected the battery. What is going on here? Is the car still safe to drive?

It's usually only when I have a passenger but I believe it may have once gone off when i didn't have one. I'm thinking about taking it into the dealer because there is currently nothing my mechanic can do.

Also there's a  squeaking noise in the front right sometimes when I hit bumps or once in a while it will continue for a few minutes while driving. You can't Hear it with the radio on. Mechanic just oiled everything but has found no problems. 

Oh and my stereo/center console sometimes doesn't light up until thirty seconds after my car has been started.

I had a few questions about my 2011 Honda Element. I love the car and it hasn't given me any trouble. I've tried to stay up with the maintenance as best I could, but have a few questions. The vehicle has 69,000 miles on it. I have replaced all the tires, and kept up with the oil changes and I wanted to be sure I was understanding the manual correctly. 

Two weeks ago the Maintenance Minder came on recommending I replace the transmission fluid. The manual asks me to follow the Maintenance Minder and ""ff you regularly drive your vehicle under these conditions, have the transmission and transfer fluid changed at 60,000 miles."" The conditions referenced are hilly/towing, neither of which I encounter. So, firstly I wasn't sure if the 60K figure applied to me. I went ahead and took it to a mechanic, hoping to get the fluid replaced.(I'm a car novice, but after doing some reading this seems like a process I can handle) The mechanic said the fluid was fine (""good"", to quote), and said for me to save my money. 

I'm thinking I should find another mechanic or go ahead and replace it myself? FWIW, the M.-minder stopped coming on.

I posted this in the Auto Detailing sub but there isn't a lot of traffic around there and thought I might cross post it here.  If you have a suggestion for a better sub, feel free to let me know!

I just got a used truck, a really nice 2009 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  It's a beautiful color called Speedway Blue.  

It looks like this: http://images.gtcarlot.com/pictures/27178371.jpg

The problem is, being a used truck, it had a few scratches and such on it and either a former owner or dealer tried to repair those scratches with a paint pen or a brush.  Adding to the issue is the fact that the color is WAY off.  It's MUCH darker than my paint and makes all the issues more noticeable.  On top of all that, most of the ""repairs"" stick up above the surrounding paint.  They put the paint on too thick.

So, long story short, I want to fix it but I don't know how.  I washed and waxed my car yesterday and got a good idea of how many there were.  There are some on every panel and it will be quite a job.  

I figure I have 2 options:

1. Sand down the repairs (maybe wet sand) until everything is smooth and put down the right color (using a spray can of factory color paint) along with some clear coat on top.
2. Try and use some sort of cutting compound or scratch remover on the repairs.  This should take them down to even with the rest of the paint without doing as much damage to the surrounding area.  Then fill with paint and clear.  

Which option would be best or is there another option I haven't thought of?  I can't afford a re-spray and doing this myself should only be about $100.

Anyway, it was a 10 minute oil change for $20. The car turned on fine and I was able to drive to a restaurant and eat there. When I went back out about an hour later, the car wouldn't start. It turns and wants to turn on, but it doesn't. A couple of times, it turned on and stayed on for a minute until it shut off by itself. I did notice that the check engine light turns on now.

It ran fine before, no sputters, it didn't turn off randomly, nothing was wrong. I'm thinking about talking to my dads lawyers if these people don't own up to it. 

I didn't know until later but a lot of people I know have had problems with that place and they always say its not their fault.

when i turn the engine on when it is cold (from sitting overnight), it doesn't feel quite right. I think every car i know idles around 1200 cold for a while before dropping down to around 800 when the engine warms up. 
however, in this camry, the engine idles around 300 rpms when cold... if i give it a little gas, it will shoot up to maybe 1500 then it would just die down and stall..... no idea why this is happening...

however, if i give it gas, and hold down the gas pedal to keep it consistent at 1500 for about 20, 30 seconds, then when i let go of the gas, everything seems to be normal and it will idle at 1200 until warm and will drop down to 800.

does anyone know what may be wrong with it and how to go about fixing it?

1367791358.0,6,self.MechanicAdvice,1dr5m8,2005 Honda Civic DX 1.7L Tensioner Pulley/Alternator Nightmare,lejonjames,7,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1dr5m8/2005_honda_civic_dx_17l_tensioner/,"Hi, I'm new here. I'm hoping someone can help me understand what to make of my present situation.

In the five years we have owned our vehicle, outside of routine maintenance, the only major repair was replacing an alternator no more than 18 months ago.

The vehicle was presented to an Air Force on-base Firestone for the standard milestone mileage inspection.

Results of inspection include recommended tune-ups of struts, brakes, coolant, spark plugs, and rotors. We follow through with the recommended repairs. We pick up the vehicle and pay.

A few days later, wife notices the battery light is on. Unsure, she brings the vehicle back to Firestone on base, and as the car rolls into the parking lot, it succumbs to full-electrical failure, and coasts limply into a parking spot.

A Firestone mechanic takes a look. He notices visible slack of the ""alternator tensioner pulley"". (I don't know what this is). The Firestone documentation for this visit reads as follows: 

&gt;There is slack in the tensioner pulley. Part avail. through dealer. Cust came in for batt check and batt is not the problem. We rec seeing dealer.

Our vehicle is then towed from Firestone to the Honda Dealership. Honda dealership mechanics tell us, ""Yep, the alternator adjuster needs to be replaced."" Honda special orders the part.

My limited understanding is that ""alternator adjuster"" and ""tensioner pulley"" are one in the same. Please feel free to correct me, as this is one of the questions that I've been unable to get an answer to from the mechanics working on my wife's car.

My wife gives Honda permission to replace the part. They do. They call and tell us that the part didn't fix it; they put the car all back together but  it didn't work, so they check the alternator, and the alternator is bad. As expected, they tell us that the fault is our own for not having a Honda-certified factory-direct-whatever alternator installed and settling for the aftermarket. I respect Honda's right to assert this. I may, however, disagree.

I decide to look back over the Firestone inspection checklist from before the car died. In every category, there is a check box, whether green for OKAY, yellow for SUGGESTED, and red for REQUIRED, and in each check box, there are checks indicating inspection. I notice that the section for ""belt tensioner"" is unchecked; it is the only thing on the entire checklist without a marking. I bring the sheet to the Firestone to ask what this means but I get no answer. I bring the sheet to another Firestone, I'm told that it's ""weird."" None of this has helped me understand anything.

Firestone can't tell me if they inspected the ""belt tensioner"" in the first place. Honda is telling me the tensioner/adjuster was bad, and now, $450 later, Honda is telling me the alternator is also bad. 

**My questions:**

1. How are the tensioner/adjuster and the alternator interrelated. I was told by someone at Honda that these two things were NOT related.

2. If a tensioner/adjuster is too tight/too loose, what can happen to the alternator? And how quickly?

3. Could the work on the brakes, front struts, rotors, etc. have brought a mechanic into accidental contact with the tensioner/adjuster assembly?

4. Is it not unheard of for an alternator with less than 10,000 miles to give up the ghost?

5. Is replacing a tensioner/adjuster without checking the alternator on a car that has presented with electrical failure normal?

6. Is the ""belt tensioner"" portion of the Firestone inspection the same kind of tensioner I am replacing, and could this have been caught 2 days before the car died?

One more thing I was told by the Honda service center: my tensioner was bad and I've been slowly damaging my alternator (even after they told me the two were unrelated) and there's no way of knowing how long it's been bad. Frustratingly, isn't this what that Firestone vehicle inspection check box was supposed to prevent?

If I say tensioner/adjuster once more I might die.

I'm not trying to stir up any animosity or foment conspiracy, but I do feel like the people who are making statements and recommendations about my vehicle aren't making themselves available or answering my questions directly. Then there's the obvious disadvantage I find myself at because I went into art instead of automotive. 

I am hopelessly befuddled and could use some good advice. Even if nothing is amiss and just an unfortunate confluence of events, feel free to let me down easy.

I've used him for about 5 years for my various cars.  He is very good, and reasonably priced (but not a super bargin, just fair).  He is also very honest, which is why I keep returning.  I've probably spent around $20,000 at his shop over the last 5 years, so I'm not just talking a few oil changes.  
He took in one of my classic cars for a front end rebuild - about 15 hours shop time and $500 in parts.  Problem is, he has had my car for 3 months, and it is not finished.  I call him every other week and ask, and he apologizes but says he is ""just so busy.""  This is true, he is busy.  
At what point am I entitled to some sort of compensation for him keeping the car for so long?  I pay $150/month for insurance for a car I can't use.  A 15 hour job with common parts should not take three months.  I'm not expecting a 2 day turn around and I do have other cars to drive, but this bothers me.

Sometimes the clutch doesn't let go of the flywheel on my 1978 VW bus

A) If I start it in gear and clutch in then it starts OK

B) If I start it out of gear and clutch out then it won't go into gear after pressing the clutch

C) If I am travelling under power and press the clutch, the engine races at about 1/3 travel

D) If I press the clutch in approaching a junction, letting the speed drop right down then I can take it out of gear and put it into gear with no trouble - even with a significant pause between gears

E) If I press the clutch to take it out of gear and then release the clutch, I cannot get it back into gear. Sometimes I can force it into a high gear to recover.


The clutch is cable and terminated solidly on the gearbox, which rules out loose engine mounts, bubbles in hydraulic fluid etc.

I think D and A rules out a pilot bearing failure (+ no noise)

I think C rules out clutch adjustment 

Could contamination on the plate cause this if so will it burn off with regular use?

So I have a 2005 Honda Accord EX Coupe. The car has been nothing but great to me. Soon enough I noticed myself pressing the window button multiple times before it would go. I figured it was the switch because sometimes I'd press it and then a minute later the window would go down or up (this was only sometimes). Eventually it stopped moving WHILE my window is half way down. So my window is half down still. First thing I did was take the switch out and take it apart. I notice the button itself was broken. Whatever, I take the button out and move the switch inside and nothing moves. At this point I figure I'll get a new switch and also replace the motor eventually. I thought I'd just push the window up and force the motor. Took the door pannel out and come to find out there only a tiny space to move my hands around the area where the motor and window is. I tried to force the window up and it will not move at all. Me and 3 other people at the same time tried to lift this window up from the top and we also tried from the bottom. 

Does this sound like the window is stuck itself due to poor lubrication? If this is the case, how can I remove this window and work on it? I have a friend who replaced windshields and windows for a living and I was going to smash my window and just claim it on my insurance (I'm paying $480 /month I figure I'll finally get something out of it). I thought I'd ask you fine gentlemen/ladies on here considering you guys would have far more experience and better solutions than me. this has been this way for a few months now and I'm desperate to get it fixed.

The labor on the heads is guaranteed with a 12month/12,000 mile warranty and I've only driven 150 miles since the install. I spent $650 on all the parts and labor, of which, $300 went to the shop.

I have for the past 2 years tried without success to track down a cold start issue i have with my car.

The car is a 96 Pajero (fellows from the US will know it as a Montero), with the 2.8 turbodiesel. The engine is one of the last ""simple"" diesels, e.g mechanical pump, albeit with the turbo.

Now, the issue: each morning, with the car cold, it starts like a champ. It fires just about instantly. though after a second it starts to idle roughly. as if one or two holes does not work. At this point, pressing the accelerator has almost no effect, it completely refuses to rev. Though, after working the throttle for a bit (10-20 seconds) it WILL rev, and start working normally. During this process there is usually quite a bit of white smoke. Then it's fine, and works as it should until it gets cold again. the issue is worse when the weather is colder.

Now, i have so far done the following in an attempt to cure the problem, without any change to the issue.

The car has done 225 K km's, the pump was checked during an engine rebuild by a PO at 180 K's. (i have the receipt)
Removed, measured and tested the glow plugs. They work fine (starts glowing red in the right spot withing 1/2 second)
Checked the glow voltage and glow controller behavior, no issues.
Removed the fuel pump, changed the front main seal on this, as it is a known weak point.
Replaced fuel filter
Replaced injectors. The car ran somewhat better at full throttle after this, but no change to the morning cough.
Replaced whatever rubber hoses i could find in the fuel system in the engine bay.

I am sort of at a loss as to what can cause his, and thought i'd give Reddit a try to see if any diesel techs have any insights. There may be some very simple thing i have overlooked or not thought of. I am more experienced with gas than diesel engines unfortunately.",,False,,t5_2tkvu,False,,,True,t3_1agm0q,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1agm0q/rough_running_diesel_on_cold_start/,

So every now and then, we'd check it and add a quart or so. While he was out in the car, he decided to check the oil. I'm not sure if he forgot to put the oil cap back on, or just didn't put it on all the way (is this even possible?). So of course, oil came shooting out. When he checked, he couldn't find the cap anywhere, so he assumed there was also no oil in the engine left (he never actually checked it). He got a family member to bring him more oil and a new cap, and proceeded to dump oil into the engine until he could see it below the brim. He figured it had overheated because on his way home, it was sputtering some, and smoking out the tailpipe.

I finally got around to looking at it today and realized what the problem is (I used to 'work' at a buddy's mechanic shop for a few years. I'm not the most knowledgeable about cars, but I know more than the average person, I think). I know the oil can get splashed around by the crankshaft, and up into the pistons, etc. But since it hasn't been driven much in this state, is there permanent damage I should be worried about? Once it's drained, is there anything else I can/should do? Or any advice you might have?

Also, the low A/C cap came off. He said 'it just popped off'. It looks like I'm missing a piece between the valve and the cap, but my A/C knowledge is very limited. Maybe I'm just not manhandling the cap enough to get it back on? Or a certain tool?

I've been using Royal Purple 5w30 for the past year. Swapping every 5k religiously. Could my oil lines be clogging for some reason?

My engine when it's running doesn't feel like anythings wrong. Idle is normal. Accelerates normally. No cooling problems. Everything works. 

So what should I think about doing? Could a can of Engine Restore or a Seafoam treatment help? My only concern with these is that this engine just crossed the 108k miles and the carbon buildup might actually help with sealing some parts.

1359774687.0,7,self.MechanicAdvice,17qgzh,2004 Ford Escape Idle issues (a bit elaborate),Btrash,7,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/17qgzh/2004_ford_escape_idle_issues_a_bit_elaborate/,"I have a 2004 Ford Escape XLT 3.0L V6. I have a bit of a multi-part question that actually may be more than one issue. Sorry if this is a bit long winded.

In [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/33OjS9f.jpg?1), I am trying to identify the two circled pieces, and gain some insight into whether they may be causing my problem(s).  

1. To begin, last summer on an extremely hot day my car wouldn't idle, period. I was stuck in a parking lot and used my phone to look up a few things that could be the issue and came across potential vacuum leaks being the case, so I was checking for any flattening of hoses and noticed that the top circled piece, which seems to be a valve into the air intake, had popped out slightly.  I pushed it in fully and viola, I could idle.  Is this piece supposed to be just held in with friction? It seemed a bit gooey in there so I don't know if some adhesive or something is used.  

2. Today it was very cold ( -14F) and snowing with decent winds on the way home.  About 2-3 miles from home, my check engine light came on but nothing seemed to sound off or feel off about how it was driving, so I kept going a bit to feel it out (traffic was slow due to the weather, so I didn't feel like I was pushing it).  After a minute, the engine seemed to feel like it was surging (can't think of any way to put it) a bit, so I let off the gas and it stopped.  Gave it gas again and it was fine for a minute again, then surged. (repeat 1 or 2 more times as I am pretty much to my exit now).  Now at the 2 stoplights to my house when idling, it is VERY rough and the engine is ""surging"". I made it home and decided to check the same valve, which was fine. When opening the hood to check this, there was quite a dusting of snow that made its way in there and it smelled of burning rubber/plastic... should much snow be able to make its' way in there?  I looked up a few other things. MAF sensor, IAC valve, and PCV valve are mentioned in a few threads for idle issues on escapes.  I don't have a security hex to check the MAF sensor, or new gaskets to replace on the IAC valve if I take that off to check, so I went looking for the PCV Valve.  I couldn't really get down to where others mentioned the PCV Valve would be, but in removing the top cover, I noticed this hose that hooked up to the previously mentioned trouble valve has a rubber elbow that looked pretty degraded and upon inspection the inside of the elbow is torn. Now I would obviously like to replace it, which is one reason I would like to identify this part, but the other reason is, could this rubber piece be what smelled of burning and causing the problem I had tonight? As a note, I did start it up again a bit later, and it wasn't having idling issues anymore and the check engine light was no longer on.  

Any help would be appreciated, sorry for the wall of text.  I am not extremely mechanically inclined, but I can usually fix most things using common sense and a tutorial, but If you think it would be more worth my time to have it more thoroughly looked over by a professional  because of the such vague details that I am able to provide, please don't hesitate to let me know.

I get the logistics of what I need to do but I also know I tend to be terrible with my hands once I get into projects like this if I don't have a plan of action.

The genesis of this problem is, there's gas leaking from around the #1 fuel injector. I'm almost certain that it's just the o-ring that needs replaced (the injector itself looks fine, not cracked, but I haven't had it out). I know I need to pull off the rail and I'll do new rings on all 4 injectors while I have it apart. How do I deal with the gas that's invariably going to come pouring out when I disconnect the rail from the fuel line? Everything i've read just says 'catch it in a pan' -- but that makes no sense. It'd have to be under the truck, so I just let the gas drip down the block? that can't be right. I know for the coolant I can just drain it with the drain plugs in the radiator and on the block, but gas i've never had to drain. Any advice on the logistics of dealing with dripping fluids would be helpful.

Here's a helpful picture of a way nicer truck than mine with the throttle body removed and a good view of the fuel rail/injectors.

As a side note, while I'm doing this and have the thing apart, I'm going to also replace the radiator, but are there any ""while you're in there"" kinds of tasks I should know about?

I'm having an issue when I first go to start it after sitting for a couple hours. When I first turn the ignition to run position, sometimes everything comes on as it should and the vehicle starts, other times it acts as if the battery is dead and the starter will not turn over at all, however if I let it sit a couple seconds, or turn the key off then back to run all acts normal. 

Usually after this happens, the engine will sit at idle for a brief time and slowly stall out. If I rev the engine to about 1500 RPM for about 30 seconds to a minute, it does not stall out. However, if I put it into reverse or drive relatively it seems as though all the electronics inside the vehicle (a GT Gas Tuner, Radio, Dash, etc) will cut on and off while moving and quit whenever I stop (at a red light, etc). After leaving the vehicle running for awhile, it stops doing this altogether and I have no issues until the next time I go to start it.

I've checked the battery voltage after running for awhile with the vehicle off and it's at about 13 VDC, and then while it's running it's around 14 VDC. I have yet to check it after being off for awhile, I can do that if it would help.

Thank you in advance.

**Edit:** I just checked the voltage of the battery after sitting for about 30 hours and it's at 12.41 volts before starting it, and is experiencing the same symptoms. Also, forgot to mention, none of the external lights are affected when the rest of the electronics cut off and on.

Recently I've come across the problem of having very little heat through the heater core.
While the blower is not running, the heater core hoses are both hot, while the blower running the inlet hose is hot while the outlet is cooler. Which means that the heater core is not clogged. The upper radiator hose is hot, while the lower cool which I would expect. The thermostat has recently been changed along with the cooling system being burped properly, including the blower being on high/hot while burping the system to get rid of any possible air bubbles within the heater core.

I noticed while changing out the thermostat that the coolant temperature sensor was eroding because of the glycol mix of the antifreeze. It will be replaced. However, I haven't noticed that the fans turn on because of this, but the coolant gauge reads normal operating temperature whether idling, cruising at low RPM, or doing 65 MPH down the freeway.
The water pump works fine as I can visually see the coolant flow from the water neck on the radiator.

I would imagine that the radiator cap would cause a problem much like a clogged radiator; opening sooner rather than later by the pressure in the system. As I'm not sure when the radiator cap was last changed, this is also a common problem when concerning loss of coolant (which isn't a problem immediately).
The other problem that I would see is the coolant temperature sensor itself, however, it has nothing to do with the heater core temperature, rather the fans not turning on.
While squeezing all the hoses (upper and lower radiator, heater core hoses), when cold and hot, the coolant raises in height with the radiator cap off. This might lead me to believe that there might be a sleight blockage in the system not allowing the hot coolant to flow through the heater core effectively.",,False,,t5_2tkvu,False,,,True,t3_16vm7y,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/16vm7y/heating_problem/,

1. Started back down my street when it jumped back up to ~235°.

So, I figured that the shocks themselves had leaks in them so I replaced them with Gabriel Hi-Jackers from Autozone. I replaced the lines with it  and the thing is still bottoming.

My little Corolla that I've loved for the time I have it, as well as fending off kids to turn it into a drift missle, has had an issue going on for a while and I've just been dealing with it until I've had the resources and space to work on it. Currently it likes to make top end noise near #4 cylinder after a weird set of circumstances occurs. When you're driving it and you put the throttle in just the right place, it starts rattling really loud, but if you dip the throttle just a tad more or completely let off the gas, it stops. 

However if you gun it to WOT, it will get loud and be apparent no matter what after 3.7-4k RPMs. I'm trying to figure out what it might be and so far all I can think of was a blocked oil passage, or possibly a bad rocker arm. I know it's #4 because I took a stethoscope to the valve cover and it was most apparent near that area on the valve cover. It's just really odd because the noise is never consistant. You can let the car idle and you can't hear it at all unless you put a stethoscope up to it.

I botched the threads to the CV axle that I had already put in and stripped the hell out of it, and really I just decided to go pick up a another new CV because this is my daily driver and I've been trying to get it back on the road. But now... I can't get the stupid cv out of the transmission, which is the pictures above. the CV is recessed about a 1/2, making prying against the transmission impossible. the old CV had a lip that you where able to pry against, and I got it out in about 10 minutes with the right tools. This one is perfectly rounded edges, save for the track where the boot locks in. As you can see I accidently pulled the boot off of it trying to pull it out. I don't know how to get it out! I've tried lots of different pry bars and places to pry off of, and nothing seems to give it that pop I need to get it out. anyone else ever come up with this problem? Currently I think I need to go grab a another pry bar that is a little bit smaller (looks like a flathead screwdriver except a lot bigger, with a bend at the end) and I might be able to get in there and be able to get it to pop, I dunno though. I'm a computer guy, and a horrible car guy, but we all gotta learn somewhere I suppose &gt;.&gt;

From this angle you can better see how it is 'recessed' into a ring. Does a Pickle fork still work in something like this? It seems like that idea is more specific to something like this:

I did try a few of the ideas here, and I want to thank everyone for helping! I must just need to pull... harder? idk. I'll keep trying, figured I would update though.


DOUBLE EDIT:

I CONQUERED THE DAMN THING!

I made a slide hammer vice grip. I already had a vice grip, so what I did was rent the slide hammer from Auto Zone. (5 pound slide hammer) Went to menards and found a threaded rod (happened to be 7/16s that fit into my pair of vice grips) Bolts and Washers. Put the nut/washer on one end of the threaded rod, put the weight on there, screwed into vice grip. 3 tugs and bam, all done. Pulled out like a damn dream. Thank you all for your help, and please recommend this solution to anyone in my spot.

So I am going to try to make this short but detailed and try not to bore you guys to tears. First I do want to say thank you for reading and any help you can give me! 
About two months ago when I would get low on gas (less than a quarter tank) the engine service required light would come on, but once I put gas in the car the light would go off. Fast forward about a month ago and both the check engine and the engine service required light came on. The car was having problems intermittently when the engine was warm. The cars RPMs would drop to about 400 and then cycle between there and about 1000. Sometimes the car would actually stall if you did not rev the engine. We had our mechanic come over and check the codes. No codes came up but it showed the fuel was running rich. So we replaced the front O2 sensor (side note: we replaced back O2 sensor about 6 months ago). After the sensor was replaced the car was running fine for about a day. We then started having the same starting problems we were having, although now sometimes it would do it with a cold engine. We are not receiving any error codes and nothing seems to be off (we drove the car with the ODB scanner tool on and nothing came up as being too low or high, etc.) My husband and I cleaned the electronic throttle module. It did have some gunk on it and seemed to open and close easier after we cleaned it. Well after that it seemed to be doing well, but this morning was the worst. First thing this morning on a cold engine I had the starting problem. Then while driving every time I slowed down or stopped the RPMs were dropping low and then high and acting very much like it was going to stall (it never did). When I dropped my daughter off at school, when I tried starting the car again it had the same starting problem. When I got home my husband cleaned the mass air flow sensor and put more gas in the car along with a fuel system cleaner. The car is driving awesome but it is still having the starting problem!

About 50% of the time I start the car after periods of rest, the engine idles roughly on 3 cylinders for a minute and then smooths out.  Sometimes a few puffs of white smoke will appear and it smells like antifreeze.  I have done four oil changes in two years and do not have milkshake anywhere in the system yet (and I'm keeping my fingers crossed).  My theory is that the combustion chamber is filling with coolant only when it's on the down-stroke (guaranteed to occur &gt;50% at time of engine shutdown).

I'm broke and can't afford to fix it or buy anything else right now, but I have a pretty good practical working knowledge of some cars, having worked on mine and my friends' cars (Nissan, Honda, BMW, and Toyota).  I don't know how to rebuild an engine (never tried it) but I can perform preventative maintenance like changing spark plugs, cap&amp;rotor, brake &amp; clutch flushes, trans &amp; diff flush, brake pads &amp; rotors, ball joints, clutches, etc).  

To manage the coolant leak, I've just been periodically opening the radiator cap when the engine is cold and adding coolant until it rises into the neck.  I'm going through about a gallon of 50/50 every 3,000 miles.

The funny thing about all of this is that the coolant overflow tank is always at the ""full"" mark.  No coolant ever leaves the tank, or I'm losing coolant faster than the tank can manage.  Are the tanks just not equipped to deal with coolant loss of this magnitude?

The radiator cap has a red ""safety valve"" style cap.  When I lift this plastic valve to open the radiator, there is a brief hiss and some bubbles going into the tank.  The little rubber hose between the radiator and the tank seems to be completely blocked unless the valve is open, but I don't think I can really leave it open because, as I understand it, radiators are essentially pressure cookers under about 10-15psi; leaving it open would just create a really big smoke show and eventually cook the engine.

Thank you r/Mechanicadvice for your previous help. I’ve been obsessing over this issue for the last 4 days and I have run into another unexpected turn. I was able to remove the starter. I took it in to a local auto parts’ store and it operated when the switch was jumped. Now, I’m not sure if it functioned well but I know that it at least engaged and spun.

I am now back at square one since the starter is indeed in functioning condition (though this may be the original starter with 216k miles on it). I’ve read accounts of other peoples’ starters bench testing fine outside of the car but nonfunctional in the vehicle. How likely could this be for my own? Is it worth buying a new starter to swap and test?
I’m going to rerun my voltage drop tests to see if I can locate something I may have missed earlier. So far this is what I know:

1.	Checked all fuses. Nothing turns up.
2.	Tried started in neutral and checked for reverse lights when in reverse - no start, lights come on.
3.	Swapped Ignition Switch. Still hear the click in indoor driver side relays.
4.	Voltage tests (drop when key turned to III position)

o	Battery = 12.64 drops to 12.38

o	Engine ground check: Pos bat to engine block = 12.6 drops to 12.33

o	Starter ground: Positive bat to starter frame = 12.61 drops to 12.38

o	Starter power: Negative bat to solenoid power (wire/bolt) = 12.61 drops to 12.4

I put it in the oil, let the engine idle for 5 minutes and then changed the oil. The noise didn't go away and when I drove it around the block it seemed really down on power.

It actually turned out to be a very simple procedure. I bought a 2 inch Ultima open belt primary off of Ebay for $630 which came with a full clutch kit and starter jack shaft included. It took me about 2 days of work to finish taking the old primary off and putting the new one on. Some words of advice:

1. When attempting to take your primary off make sure that it's not bolt on through the starter into the rear of the inner primary cover

2. Put on the spring stop washer before you put your inner primary on.

I am hoping /r/MechanicAdvice can help!

I am hoping for some help in fixing my **2004 Chevy Impala**.  It has numerous problems, two of which are the following...

1. An old problem that I have had to troubleshoot a number of times is the fact that the car simply refused to start.  The battery was not dead, the starter worked just fine, and I had no other electrical problems that I was aware of.  In 2008, I had to have my ignition switch replaced.  The mechanic did not know what happened, but the switch froze, and absolutely nothing would get the key to turn.  So we replaced the entire switch (a costly repair).  Now I have a problem with my passlock system - occasionally when I attempt to start my car, nothing will happen, and my ""Security"" light will flash.  A fix I found online (after many, many hours trying to discover the problem), was to re-calibrate the passlock system: simply put the key in the ignition, turn to ""ON"", wait for 10 minutes, then start the car.  Works every time.  As you can imagine, some days I do not have time to wait around for 10 minutes for the car to start.  **Is there any way for me to completely bypass the passlock system or to turn it off?**

2. More recently, my radiator fan continues to run after the engine is shut off.  A simple fix is for me to turn the engine back on and off again.  But I am concerned this is only fixing the symptoms, not the actual problem.  I just recently spent the week in Savannah and one of the valets completely killed my battery because of this problem.  **Could it be a bad sensor/relay, and how would I be able to tell?**",,False,,t5_2tkvu,False,,,True,t3_wgewd,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/wgewd/a_twofer_2004_chevy_impala_radiator_fan_continues/,

I have a clutch issue that has been nagging me for a while:

Engagement takes 2k RPM and a second of slip just to move in first gear. Problem is that at lower RPM it just stutters, ""grabs"", etc., causing loss of RPM and stall.  Stuttering can be felt throughout the car and is nearly violent at 1k RPM.

Car is a 2005 Subaru Legacy GT - otherwise is in great mechanical health. Clutch is ~1.5 years old with &lt;15k on it so far, was replaced by the dealer, they don't find the engagement odd at all.

Advice?

EDIT: I should clarify, the issue is engagement stutter in first gear at RPM lower than 3k when trying to accelerate from a dead stop.  Feeding in the clutch normally to achieve a smooth takeoff just doesn't work, as the clutch reaches the point of engagement with lower RPM it simply stutters like it's grabbing and then slipping.  At higher RPM, launches are smooth but that's because I can let the clutch slip long enough to fully engage, but that makes for (really) bad practice and so you can't really drive the car in traffic.

To be clear, the clutch is not overly stiff, does firmly engage, and doesn't slip unintentionally in any gear - the motor is also strong and doesn't lack for power at any time; the only reason a stall is nearly induced is due to the violent rattling caused by the clutch stutter if you try to engage first at low RPM.

This is more of a mechanic ethical question. Here's the story:

125cc scooter needs rear tire changed. Takes 15 minutes to take rear wheel off from my own experience, but I don't have the tools to change the tire itself. I buy a tire online, drive the scooter and new tire into the shop I've dealt with before. Ask them to change tire. Get quoted 30-50$ CAD. 

Three days goes by. I get a call. They can't get the wheel off the axle. Okay, I'm in no rush. Another week, same thing. Another week: ""we got it to budge!"" Three weeks later: ""tire's changed, you owe us $250CAD for the time.""

Is this cool? Can this happen? Is the fact that they couldn't get the wheel off my concern monetarily? I don't know if I see the logic in my own or their argument. Sure, the wheel may have seized, but there is a flat rate for certain jobs. The job I asked for was a tire change, and a price was quoted to me.

I went ahead and took the time to install it directly to the battery using a stereo amp wire kit.  I have it mounted under the passenger seat.  everything seems to be working perfectly.

I would like the unit to turn off when I turn the car off.  Considering it is directly hooked into the battery, one of my passengers could leave it on by mistake.  That would mean we would have to either get a jump or push the car and drop the clutch in 2nd.  This would not be ideal.

I have taken the inverter apart and I would like to modify it.  there is a switch that turns the unit off and on, I was going to tap into that wire and I would like to hook that into my ignition wire.

Is this a bad idea?  How would I go about doing that?

When the compressor kicks on it instantly jumps to 60psi and builds to almost 70psi before the compressor kicks off. When it does kick off it instantly jumps back down to 25psi. Like someone hit a lit switch, it's that quick. 

 My theory is, for some reason high side pressure is getting into the low side. Obviously there is no cold air and the compressor is getting the shit worked out of it. Is there a valve somewhere in the system that is stuck open that is letting high side pressure get into the low side line?

Update:  Turns out the problem was that some refrigerant had sludged up a bit in the bottom of the drier causing the characteristics of low refrigerant. When I added the 2 more cans it loosened that sludge up which then re-expanded and caused an overcharge situation and caused the expansion valve to stick open.

This is my first time visiting this subreddit. I hope I'm not in violation of any rules or etiquette. If so, I am happy to remove this. (Also, I did NOT intend this to become the novel that it has).   
  
---
  

I have an issue with the front passenger side wheel. I'm about to install the third set of wheel bearings, in just under 2 months. So I know something else is not right.  
  
This is the first time I've done wheel bearings, but I'm fairly handy under a car so hopefully it's not a ""common sense"" error. What I cannot figure out is what I'm doing wrong, so I'm hoping some kind soul(s) can help me out. This car is my daily driver to get me to work, and it goes about 90 miles a day. Without the car, I can't get to work, which means I can't support my family :(  
  
Here's what I've been doing:  

   1. Jack the car up on passenger side, put jack stand under car
   2. Remove the passenger wheel
   3. Remove spindle nut from CV axle
   4. Loosen and remove ball joint bolt that holds the ball joint onto the knuckle.
   5. Using a pry bar, push down the control arm/ball joint assembly to get clearance to pull the knuckle off the joint and the CV from the spindle.
   6. Now that the knuckle is separated from the ball joint, remove the caliper and rotor to expose the wheel hub.
   7.  From the back, use a screwdriver to pop out (if it doesn't just fall out in pieces) the inner bearing. Push out the wheel hub by feeding the screwdriver all the way through the center of the hub, where the handle of it will sit against the bearing and I can tap out the hub. 
   8. Now the hub is removed, with outer bearing and seal still attached.
   9. The inner bearing is free, sometimes the seal will remain on the end of the CV axle. 
   10. Remove the bearing and seal from the hub assembly. I have done this two ways, with a screwdriver and with a table vice. Since it's the old bearing I figure it does not matter if I break it more. 
  
Now this is where it differs. I don't have a press, so to put on the new bearings I've done it two different ways. The first time I used a wood block and a rubber mallet, and gently tapped the bearing onto the hub until it was seated. It lasted a month and a half.   
  
The second time - which I just did on Tuesday - I used some sand paper to smooth out the cylinder that the outer bearing goes on. It's not highly damaged, but had a little pitting around where the bearing goes, making it feel a little rough. After sanding it down I was able to press the bearing onto the hub relatively easy using my hands. I don't know if that's a bad sign or not. This bearing lasted two days.  
  
In both cases, I used the force of tightening down the spindle nut onto the CV to press the inner bearing into the back of the knuckle.
  
This morning on my way in to work, I started getting a bunch of noise from that wheel again.  

According to what I see online, I'm greasing the bearings appropriately and also putting grease inside the knuckle where the bearings spin. The inside of the knuckle acts as the race for the bearings, the races that come with the bearings are not used.  
  
I'm using Timken SET11 bearings, Timken seals, and Timken Hi-Temp Wheel Bearing Grease (red). So I'm not trying to go too cheap.  
  
I had my tires rotated and two new ones put onto the rear yesterday. While the car was on the lift I noticed the new bearing (one day old at that time) was not right - I had play in my wheel. The mechanic tightened the spindle nut further and a lot of the play went away. The tire seemed to have a lot more resistance (is it possible to overtighten the spindle nut?) than before, but at least for the drive home from the tire shop it drove much better. In fact, my brakes felt tighter than they did on my way TO the shop - which also confuses me as to what could cause that.  
  
This morning, I started getting the shake back. Starts around 30-40 MPH. Lots of shaking when I brake. Now, a constant squeaking that sounds very much like the bearings the first time they failed.  
  
What I'm suspecting:  
  

   1. I'm not pressing the bearings on correctly/fully. Maybe I need to remove the entire knuckle, remove the bearings, and use some kind of actual press to press the outer AND inner bearings onto it rather than rely on the force of tightening down the spindle to press on the inner?
   2. The minor wear on the inside of the wheel hub (that I smoothed out via sandpaper) is somehow causing it to fail. 
   3. I'm under/over torquing the spindle nut, either causing too much friction on the bearings causing them to break down or allowing movement in the wheel tangent to the rotation of the bearings, causing the shaking and eventually breaking down the bearing. 

  
Wheels aren't my thing - I can do brakes and CV's and basic stuff, but this is the first I'm messing with anything that requires me to break apart an assembly. It's entirely possible this is all my fault, but I can't identify where the fault lies at the moment. All I know is I drive 90 miles a day, due to family illness have missed a lot of work already, and something is causing this breakdown to occur.  
  
So, I defer to you gearheads. Can someone please educate me on what I'm doing wrong (and right), and what I should attempt next to get this thing fixed. I'm out of ideas, out of money now, and really hoping its not the hub itself. I can't find a new one ANYWHERE.  
  
Last, because I don't know if relevant or not, the other issues I know of that I will be fixing are the boots on my ball joints are bad (joints seem OK though, not seized or freely moving), and on the passenger side the castle nut on the outer tie rod end (I believe outer, the part the bolts to the knuckle) is stuck and wont completely tighten down. Oh, I just remembered another one. The part of my shift linkage that bolts to the side of the transmission (I think it's some kind of stabilizer bar or something) lost its bolt, so my shifting is funky - but that's not the issue just something I noticed when I took a look this morning after I got the car to my office).  
  
Now that I type all this out it really sounds bad, but I love this little car and it saves me a TON of money. Even with these repairs I am still in the green versus what I paid for gas in my Lincoln LS. 
  
Thank you for taking the time to read this novel of a post, and any input you may have is greatly appreciated. I fear losing my job as I'm not even sure how I'll get the car home tonight...

1) Clock resets every time the car turns off.
2) Dome lights (between front seats and above the dash) don't turn on. 
3) Many of the interior lights do not come on (lights below shifter, lights on center panel, gear indicators on the speedometer). 
4) Battery keeps dying. Bought it only a year ago, tried charging it, but it only lasted less than a week and now it won't start anymore.
5) As of right now, I have it on the battery charger, and when I put the key in and turn it to on (not ignition; just electrical) the headlights will come on, the radio will come on, and the power locks and such work, but as soon as I turn the key to ignition all power immediately shuts down, including even the power locks.

I put in a new PCV valve and checked the line, they seem fine to me. I haven't replaced the crankcase breather but I checked the hose and it seemed fine. It appears to make a good seal. There's some oil around the base.

What else should I check?

Monday it was fine.  Drive home on a beautiful sunny afternoon.  Didn't drive it the rest of the night.  It stormed VERY bad that night.  Lots of heavy rain and lightning.

Tuesday, I get up for work, turn on my car, and the Service Engine, ABS, Bright Lights (High Beams), Emergency Brake, Change Oil (which was already on before and) lights all came on and didn't go off.  Also, my car didn't beep at all (seatbelt reminder, leave lights on, keys in ignition with door open, etc..) nor did the radio work.  By not working, the radio didn't even show the clock it usually does even when it's off.  But the car drive fine...I noticed no problems whatsoever besides the dash lights, beeping, and radio.

Next day, the same lights are on, but the ""Trac Off"" light comes on when I start it up also.  Now it starts to switch gears very roughly.  Going from Park to Drive is the roughest switch...the car literally shakes/moves when I put it in drive.  The switching isn't as bad when driving.  I do a little reading on the web, and someone recommends to unplug the battery, and reconnect it after 15 seconds or so to ""discharge"".  Well, I tried, and when I put the battery back in, it wouldn't start.  I took battery back out, waited an hour, put it back in and it started fine...I guess I didn't connect it tight enough the first time?

So I do some more research and a lot of people are saying that the ABS + Trac lights are a bad Wheel speed sensor, or the ABS sensors need cleaning.  I also read it could need a new ""hub assembly"" and I have no idea what that is.  However, since my car was experiencing some other very odd problems on top of the common one's I found online, I had the idea to post the totality of the problems and story here.

So I take it to Autozone to have the codes scanned.  The codes are (sorry for lengthy post, and they were handwritten by the tech and he had bad handwriting, so sorry if I mistype something):

* C1261 ABS LF front inlet valve solenoid misfunction
* C1262 ABS LF front outlet valve solenoid misfunction
* C1266 ABS LF rear outlet valve solenoid misfunction
* C1267 ABS right rear inlet valve solenoid misfunction
* C1268 ABS right rear outlet valve solenoid misfunction
* C1275 ABS Powertrain control module request ETS to be disabled
* P0748 Eng Pressure Control solenoid A Electrical

I'm pretty broke at the moment, so I was hoping you all might be able to point me in the right direction for what to ask for...maybe helping me to avoid some unneeded diagnostics.

Took my car to the gearbox repair shop to see why the clutch/flywheel was making weird noises, he tells me he cant hear anything and that its probably just the throw out bearing.

fast forward to 1 hour ago, casually sitting in traffic, next thing i know the clutch throws an absolute fit, wont go into gear, clutch pedal wont go all the way down, accelerating does fuck all, and there are 30 cars behind me pissed right the fuck off.

so i finally get it moving by ramming the gearstick into first and holding it there so the clutch has some grip and i start to move, then all of a sudden it becomes fine for about 8 seconds, just long enough to get to my house and turn it off, after turning it on again, it sounds like there is some pretty nasty metal scraping going on under there so im not game to turn it on again, but as far as i can tell the clutch has literally shattered for no apparent reason.

So all i really want to know, does it sound like it was just the clutch? or should i get the whole system replaced flywheel and all? also is there any chance it was the master or slave cylinder?

car is a 2001 mx5 NB, everything appears fine from the outside, no leaks or smoke, just a very hideous smell for about 2 minutes.

A2: Yes. The advice fluctuates from a new speed sensor to a new dashboard cluster to new resistors in my dash. No idea which it could be, and no, I don't have the money to recklessly buy new items for my car.

Q3: Have you taken it to a dealership/car service?

A3: That will be my last option. Shit is expensive for a college student.

Thanks for any help y'all can provide me.

The only shop still open late enough for me to take it in that day, was the local Acura dealership (which I've had good experiences with in the past).  After talking with the service rep on the phone here is what he emailed me:

&gt;The following are recommended repairs: right rear brake caliper is frozen – pads have “0” material remaining – rotors are ok to machine - / to replace caliper and perform a rear brake job est. $890.00

&gt;Power steering pump leaking and noisy – est. for power steering pump replacement  $525.00

On my way home from work today as I approached a stoplight I pressed the brake pedal with the same force/depth as I always do given my speed and distance from stop line.  Nothing happened.  I had to depress the brake pedal much farther than normal before the brakes engaged.  I immediately pulled off the main road and began testing the brakes at slow speeds on side streets.  Here are my observations:

The longer (time) I go without engaging the breaks the further I must depress the pedal before they engage.  

If I constantly tap/pump the brakes then they engage at the normal pressure/depth.

At the exact same time as this problem occured a scratching/scraping/grinding noise began from one of my passenger side rotors.  I believe it was the front but as I was unable to confirm.  

I very cautiously drove the remaining 0.50 miles back to my apartment.  Upon parking I got out and did a visual inspection, nothing looked abnormal on any of the four wheels/brakes/rotors, however there was a mild brake-burning smell.  There was also no fluid leaking as far as I could tell.


So that's where I'm at.  My very limited knowledge of cars leads me to believe there was a sudden leak/drop in brake fluid pressure.  My questions are:

What should I do?  Is it safe to drive it to the shop (3 miles, heavy, slow, stop-and-go traffic)?  Any advice at all would be much appreciated.",,False,,t5_2tkvu,False,,,True,t3_1hykbt,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1hykbt/need_helpadvice_brake_problem_on_way_home_from/,

This model is notorious for a cracked head, so i decided i'd take a look and see if i could throw a new head on there and keep her alive.

Well i got the head off in an two evenings pretty easily, but now there's nothing obvious to me that's wrong.  Under the valve cover looks fantastic (for 186,000 mi) and the head doesn't look bad to me (some carbon) The head gasket looked pretty solid, and the cylinders look to be gouge free.... did i open this all up for nothing? 

Is it likely the piston rings? Should I take the head to a shop and have them take a look at it?  

I'm moving pretty soon and have to decide whether to sell it or patch it up as fast as possible... 

I'd love any advice, quick tests or general mocking...

To replace the subframe you have to lift the motor up a few inches while you pull the motor mounts and install the new subframe. Looking at it, everything that needs to be unbolted is pretty straight forward but I'm wondering one thing that i can't figure out no matter how much i've looked.

What I want to know is where to connect the chains when I lift the motor up. I have one of those engine stabalizer bars that sits on the shock towwers  and has two chains you connect to the motor that would hold the motor up.

In every other car I've pulled a motor from there have either been specific hooks or I wrap the chains around the intake/exhaust manifold runners or thread a manifold bolt through the chain link and back into the block which has always worked but that method isn't really an option with this motor as far as I can tell because the intake runners are plastic.

So where can I connect this chain?

1372869920.0,5,self.MechanicAdvice,1hkqyw,Need advice on a baffling electrical situation.,wizardbrigade,7,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1hkqyw/need_advice_on_a_baffling_electrical_situation/,"Hello, I am having a really bizarre situation with my 2010 Kia Soul+ at the moment and was wondering if any of the mechanics here have encountered something similar. I should start by saying that I recently enrolled in the Progressive Snapshot program to try to save money on my car insurance. They way this works is that they send you a small device in the mail that you plug into the on board diagnostic plug just beneath the steering wheel. The device keeps tabs on how often and how hard you break as well as what times of day and night you drive, etc. After six months you send it back and if it proves that you are a good driver, you get a discount.  
  
So anyway, I received the device on Saturday, June 22nd and plugged it into my car immediately. I had no problems with my vehicle until July 1st when I went to start my car after class and it was completely dead. Absolutely no lights came on in the car when I turned the key - not even dim lights. A friend of mine jumped my car and let me borrow his jump box just in case. After jumping, my car seemed to work just fine and I drove home without a problem. When I left my car earlier in the day to go to class, it was daylight, so I was certain that I did not leave any lights on in my car. I thought about it and realized the only thing plugged in was the snapshot device, so I googled ""snapshot dead battery"". There are literally hundreds of people online with stories saying that this device has cause everything from dead batteries in their cars to a complete failure of their on board computer system. I immediately unplugged the device from my car and at that point I was still able to turn the car on after having my friend jump it the one time when I left class.  
  
In the morning, approximately nine hours later, my car was again completely dead. No lights came on whatsoever. I again jumped it and went directly to purchase a new battery. From there, I drove to work and my car sat in the parking lot for five hours. When I went to leave work, my car again would not turn on at all even though I had a brand new battery installed only five hours prior. I again had to have someone jump my car, only this time it was car-to-car instead of by jump box. We attached the batteries to one another and without even turning the cars on I could hear something switching on in my engine. I then turned my car on and it started perfectly (while still connected to the other battery) without having ever turned on the other car.  
  
This morning my car turned on without any problems and I did not have to jump it. I have filed a claim with Progressive regarding this and the representative notified me that they have had many people calling in filing claims for problems they've experienced with their cars after installing snapshot. I am waiting to hear back from a claims adjuster and have scheduled a garage appointment to have a diagnostic run. My car is able to start just for a period of time after being jumped, so I think my alternator is fine. At one point when turned off, it sounded as though a fan was running under the hood, but when turned on and off again that ceased. What do you guys think the problem is? Is it possible my new battery just needed to be driven around a bit more and now it's fine (as it started without any issue this morning after sitting for ~12 hours.) Or is it possible that some system in my car is now not turning off correctly causing some sort of parasitic drain? Any clue what this could cost me if Progressive refuses to cover the damage?

This would be a project obviously, the rear panel is my main concern. When I was reading up on these they said the body condition is more important. That panel is the only place where it looks really bad in addition to driver side behind the front wheel rust.(2nd picture in the album) 

Im not trying to restore this car perfectly, I want to look nice but not showroom. I mainly want it as a car to work on and have some fun driving. 

89k miles, engine is solid needs new brakes and battery. 

Opinions?

Last weekend, I had severe shaking and vibrations when I would brake around 70, 80 mph. I took the car to a local Toyota dealership for an unrelated reason--a recall on the driver's side window. 

Concerning the shaking, they recommend machining of the rotors, which makes sense based on conversations I've had with a few other people. However, they also recommend I replace the brake pads, which are around 50% worn. They said if I don't replace the pads, the used pads won't fit perfectly with the machined rotors and the truck will continue to shake even with machined rotors. 

Is this true/legit?",,False,,t5_2tkvu,False,,,True,t3_1hbdpy,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1hbdpy/question_on_machining_rotors_and_brake_pads/,
1372465296.0,6,self.MechanicAdvice,1ha7n8,Head gasket leak after replacement,shadetreemech,6,0,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1ha7n8/head_gasket_leak_after_replacement/,"So I changed my headgaskets and I have a small leak. I sent the heads toa  machine shop to be resurfaced and grind valves as needed. I cleaned my block with a razor blade and a green scrubby SOS pad. Fel-pro MLS gaskets, did not apply any additional sealer. I oiled my bolt threads but I FORGOT to oil the heads of the bolts and the washers (I think this is why I have a leak). I followed the torque sequence with a brand new, although shitty, Craftsman torque wrench. (My torque specs fall right in the middle of the wrench's range). Engine runs just fine and does not seem to burn any coolant. There is just a small external leak coming from the front of the passenger side head. 

The torque procedure is two torques @ ft/lbs, then back off bolts, another two torques @ ft/lbs, and then two torques to an angle. I'm thinking since I didn't lube my washers, my ft/lbs torque came short, so after I torqued to angle, I'm a little short of how tight I should be. Is it a good bet that I did not get my head bolts tight enough? I'm thinking I can just tighten the bolts up a little more to get in the ballpark of the right tightness.

The next day I went to start it in the morning and it wouldn't start. It took about two hours before it did (trying every 20-30 minutes).

I got all of my belts replaced yesterday. I went out to start my car today and again it wouldn't start for a few minutes/tries. So the problem wasn't the timing belt or serpentine (which we had assumed).

I parked the car again once I got it started. Shut it off and then tried to start it again to see if it was still having starting issues after running for a few minutes. When I tried to start it, it didn't start and I saw white smoke come from the hood. The smoke came out of an exhaust pipe under the hood that connects to the air filter. I opened the air filter and that's where the most smoke came from.

plain wrong to ""car guys"".
  
  I've been driving my '92 Accord without much thought to coolant level or engine temperature, but last (warm and humid) night, we were driving to the park on surface streets about 12 miles away with the a.c. on, when about 3/4 way there we smell something odd, and notice the temp in the red. I, the complete moron, thought that maybe the temp gauge didn't work (like its neighbor, fuel gauge) and that we were smelling the bus in front of us, so we continued to our destination..... almost! All of a sudden, we see steam spew dramatically out from under the right side of the hood and liquid (coolant, I assume) sprays the right side of the windshield. We were able to coast/push it to the parking lot nearby. 
 
   After letting it cool down for a while, we drove to a nearby gas station, about a 1/2 mile away, and it had already began to overheat. We added a gallon of pre-diluted coolant, and after letting it cool down again, we drove home, without overheating, but it seemed to be bubbling, steaming, and leaking a bit when we parked. 
 
  So now I notice the little seal/gasket thing that appears to be out of place (see photo). What is this? Is it a part that can be replaced, or is it the end of my radiator? Any help would be appreciated.

One would think that SCAT would take that into account when selling a complete 383 rotating assembly, but anyway - here I am needing to modify my connection rods.

The question is: What method works best to determine how much needs to come off the corner of the rod, without taking too much off and without having to remove the piston/cam 10 times?

Also, how much clearance should I be going for? I've heard .030 and .050. This motor is cast crank and likely will not go beyond 6200RPM.

I believe it is a 2.2L, but I'm not 100% sure. This vehicle has ~240,000 miles. And runs great other than the issue below.

I recently replaced the slave and master cylinders and bled the clutch because the pedal lost pressure and was not allowing her to get the car in gear. I completed that repair in February. 

Friday, she tells me she that the clutch has again lost some pressure and doesn't engage until the pedal is nearly to the floor. On Saturday I bled the clutch again via the bleeder screw on the slave cylinder. All was well.

However, fast forward to this morning, when she tries to leave for work she has the same problem. I have not verified her complaint, but she is a very competent behind the wheel and I trust that it is actually malfunctioning. I did pop the hood and check the fluid level, it appears to be fine.

I'm curious as to where it could be leaking at, or if its not leaking where I should look next. I'm mechanically inclined enough to take on just about any job short of swapping a tranny or pulling the engine. (Mainly due to lack of facilities and an engine hoist)

I would appreciate any advice you could give me, these cars are fairly common so hopefully a few of you have worked on them.

This morning I went to drive my car, and although the car starts, it will not shift into gear. I went to put it into reverse twice and each time it makes a horrible screeching noise and will not slip into gear. 

I am not sure whether this is a problem that will resolve itself by letting the car dry out or whether the water has caused some serious damage to  my car. 

Does anyone have an experience with this problem? Or know what could be the source of this problem? If anyone has ANY advice, I would greatly appreciate it!

A few days ago, she was stuck in traffic for an extended period of time, and put the car into park for about 40 minutes.  The car was idling erratically, started sputtering, and the CEL came on.  When the car is driving, it seems to run well, and although I haven't noticed a decrease in power, my wife says that the fuel economy has gotten worse.

I had the codes pulled by a friend a few minutes ago and this is what we got:


P0300--multiple misfires


P0301--Cylinder 1 misfire


P0302--Cylinder 2 misfire


P0304--Cylinder 4 misfire


P0100--MAF sensor


P0110--Air intake temperature circuit malfunction


P0171--system too lean


P0174--system too lean.



Any ideas where to start?  The car had the ECU replaced approximately 1-1.5 years ago.  I'm not incredibly comfortable working on my own car, but I have a Haynes manual and access to an auto hobby shop with nice tools.  


EDIT:
Alright, as stated in previous posts, I purchased carb cleaner and used it to clean the throttle body, while paying attention to try and spray into the IACV (without actually removing it).  Further, I replaced the air filter--I had to go past it anyway to get to the throttle body.  


I removed a few hoses from around the air intake and took the protective tubing off of them to further inspect them.  After inspecting them, I did my best to blow air through one side while plugging the other.  None of the three hoses that I checked appeared to be leaking air.  One hose did have a little bit of cracking at the very end, but if I'm being honest, I don't think that it is the culprit.  


I have also checked for vacuum leaks using carb cleaner around the air intake, but I have yet to hear the engine kick up at all. 


I have a car junk yard near my house which gives me access to a shitload of cheap parts.  Actually, I replaced my vacuum booster for my brakes with a part from there around a year ago.  Would it be worth pulling some 'new' hoses off of another Avensis and swapping them out?


Currently, I don't have the tools required to remove my spark plugs, but I could get access to them fairly cheaply at the auto hobby shop.

I stopped by to look at his truck today, as he said his shift cable busted and wanted to know if I could help him get a new one installed. While replacing the shift cable didn't look like a major undertaking, I did see something more concerning.


As the truck sits, the trans selector is in 1st gear, and the shifter on the column is totally disconnected (plastic shift cable end butsed under dash). Reaching up to try and move the gear selector, I was unable to move it to 2nd gear or anything other than where it was. In fact, the closer I looked, the shaft for the gear selector almost seemed to not be at a perpendicular angle to the transmission case, as I'm accustomed to seeing. (Not 100% sure on this, as I was laying at an odd angle on the ground)


So I'm kindof at a loss at this point. I've never had a problem moving a auto-tranmssions speed selector by hand before, provided the column shift handle wasn't locked out. After I left, my friend tried to use pliers to move the speed selector and was unable to move it either way. 


I'm not sure he doesn't have more serious transmission problems. Has anyone else seen anything like this?

My car was smoking from the exhaust. Its pretty clear it was burning oil. I took into my shop I like and they told me that the turbo had gone and needed to be replaced. They said I should give Mazda a call since its been an issue on this model.

I called Mazda and they said they were aware of an issue and they had issued an extended warranty. 7 years/70,000 miles. Of course, I fit the 7 years but have 77000 miles. They said I could take it to a Mazda dealership and have it diagnosed and open a case with them about out of warranty coverage. I have almost no faith that they will cover this. They keep asking for service records and I just have my dad and brother do my oil and filters, so I don't have those for all my oil changes.

Took it to a dealership and here's what they told me: The turbo went, which means it was burning oil. Since the engine was oil starved it was knocking and the timing was messed up. They said I'd need a new engine. I assume there is more wrong, but that's all they told me.

Now I honestly don't know that much about cars. I'm a computer repair guy, not a mechanic. To me, it sounds like thats a little extreme for a diagnosis. Isn't there a way to just replace what is broken without needing an entirely new engine?

And IF I do end up needing a new engine is it worth it to just sell it to a dealership as is? Or should I get what I can repaired and sell it privately?

Sorry for the long post, I'm just feeling a little helpless here. Thanks.

I warned him if we changed the oil like it needed to his car may not run correctly any more and he still wanted to do it. I dropped the pan for him and hammered it out as smooth as I could and changed the oil filter while I was there. I uses some ultra grey putting it back on to seal it instead of the gaskets to make up for any uneven areas in the pan so it wouldn't leak and added a bottle of Lucas stop slip to try to help it long enough for him to get a new car.

We kept cycling through them and adding fluid, and eventually just tried edging it up higher and it would move at higher rpms, and move normally in reverse, when we got it really moving it recede up to about 5000 rpms before it would shift for the first few shifts then would drive normal after that, all gears worked fine and it drove normally and took off normally, had a alight jerking when stopped at a stoplight but not very bad. We took it back and transmission fluid was full. So I went home and later I got a text saying it wouldn't fo in reverse so I went to check it out. It was low on fluid again, but no leak so I topped it off again.

Please see below...

My wife has a 2005 Dodge Stratus SXT, sedan, 4cyl DOHC, automatic with about 125k miles on it. She recently reported a CEL and that it was acting ""funny."" I took it for a drive first to see if it was acting up. It sure did. A little while after driving at highway speeds (55-60mph), with the cruise control on, all of a sudden the car started decelerating. I looked down and cruise had turned off. It wasn't just ""canceled"" it was all the way off. I depressed the gas pedal to get back up to speed, but as soon as the engine got up to about 2250rpm, the tach needle stopped suddenly and the engine rpm decreased all at once. Then it would creep back up to 2250rpm, hit a wall, and fall back down. It did this several times before I pulled over since I couldn't get back up to speed. I was on the shoulder, put the car in neutral and revved the engine. Same thing; it revved up to 2250rpm then fell. I put it in park and got the same result. I turned the car completely off, then started it again. Revved the engine and everything was normal. I drove another 30 miles or so without incident.  

I got home and ran the trouble codes from the CEL. They were as follows:  
&gt;[P2074](http://www.dtcsearch.com/P2074/) - Powertrain - Fuel and Air Metering and Auxiliary Emission Controls - ISO/SAE Controlled  
[P1697](http://www.dtcsearch.com/P1697/) - Powertrain - Manufacturer Controlled DTC - Manufacturer Controlled  
[P0340](http://www.dtcsearch.com/P0340/) - Powertrain - Ignition System or Misfire - ISO/SAE Controlled  

With all that, I'm not sure at all what could be wrong. A month or so ago, I had the P2074 code come up while the wife was driving. I cleared it and haven't seen it since. So maybe there's an issue with the MAP sensor and it's causing mis-readings on other sensors and creating all sorts of havoc? Does anyone have any advice on what to try? I've got a new MAP sensor on order for $18 and it's a piece of cake to replace, so I might just try that and see what happens. Does anyone know how to tell if for sure the MAP sensor is the culprit? Or any other thoughts on what it might be?


Thanks in advance!

EDIT: For anyone finding this thread...I think I've solved the problem.  It was the cam position sensor.  The sensor was bad and because the computer wasn't getting reading from the CPS, it threw the transmission into limp mode which restrictred RPM...basically enough to get you safely out of traffic.  I replaced the MAP sensor in the process too, but the rev issue came back.

After the engine has heated up, some slight shuddering can be felt at the upper end of other gears, but nowhere near as pronounced as in the 35-40mph range. I believe it's nonexistent beyond this. This shuddering occurs when the engine is under the highest load and also when the TC is locked up.

What has been replaced as part of recent maintenance:

- Upper/lower balljoints
- Wheels
- Tires
- Tierod ends
- Brake rotors
- Axles
- Distributor rotor/cap
- Sparkplugs/wires
- Front/rear motor mounts
- Air filter
- Fuel filter
- VSS
- Timing belt/water pump
- Radiator
- EGR cleaned (and gunk removed from fuel injectors during this)

Shuddering occurred before any of the stuff was replaced - a lot of this was necessary just because the car has 236,000mi on it.

The problem is very symptomatic of torque converter shudder, but I'm not certain, and I really don't want to replace my transmission needlessly. I do not want to do a stall test on my old transmission for fear of breaking the TCC, and left-foot braking while shuddering (right foot to keep the gas pedal down, since shuddering only occurs with gas) does not stop the shuddering, but also does not appear to disengage the TCC.

I drove around with the TCC solenoid unplugged, and there was no shuddering - but because there is quite a difference in torque demanded from an engine going uphill with a locked TC versus one without, I'm not sure this test really says anything.

I tested my TCC solenoid according to the factory manual - it says the specification resistance across the two solenoid connections should be between 12-24 ohms, whereas mine is 32. I'm not sure if this is significant enough, nor if a TCCS can cause what appears to be TC shudder.

I put Lubegard red in my transmission, but have only driven it about 15 miles without noticing any change in the shudder.

There is no shuddering during a brake test - that is, where the brake is held down and the car is revved up while in drive.

I'm hoping that all of this doesn't rule out something easy, because I do not want to have to replace the transmission/torque converter, especially since I'll be upgrading to a Prelude in a few months !",,False,,t5_2tkvu,False,,,True,t3_1b5skr,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1b5skr/1994_accord_lx_auto_torque_converter_shudder/,

It came back on a few weeks later, same issue only now it was reporting random misfires. I was told to clean the vacumme lines, throttle body, ans MAF sensor, and change the spark plugs.I changed all the plugs but one (Could not reach it with the tools I had and didn't want to pay $95 in shop fees for changing one plug) i did all this and the light went off again. A few days later, check light came on again, as i was driving back to the shop to get the code read, the light went off, the code was read again, and misfires and lean mixture was still being read but no check light was on. At this time, accelration was a bit sluggish and there was a occasional and slight, very slight rough idle. Fast forward a month, still having some issues so i take back to a different shop,and they cannot read any codes or replicate the problems i described. They recommended a new airfilter, as mine was dirty and to let them know if anything happens. I got a K&amp;N High flow filter, the previous one was a Specter High Flow. A few days after that, i had just exited the freeway to a light and while idling the truck wanted to die, voltmeter was going all over the place and rms were jumping from 300-700ish (I usually idle around 400-500). I got home and troubleshot it a bit. I figured out that it only would do this in drive or reverse. Neutral and Park had normal idle and no real differenc in rpms. Anyways, the rough idle got worse as more load was placed on the truck. I turned on all the lights, my foglamps and tuned my stereo and subwoofer up loud, this causes the voltmeter to hover about 9-12 volts. it was jumping around and the truck was struglng to stay on unless i applied power. I then backed up to a wall and left it in reverse and disconnected the battery to see if it was the alternator. The engine stayed on but the idle got a bit rougher with the headlights and interior lights flickering and dimming out. 
 I had a battery test on it and the battery and Alternator checked good. Engine is a Vortec 5.3 L, Battery is almost a BOSCH and about a year old and the alternator is, i believe an AC Delco, and  4 year old rebuilt. What is going on, i have no idea and i'm at a loss of what to do besides take it back to my normal mechanic. Please help!!!

UPDATE: Turns out it is the intake manifold gaskets. I just got the call from the ""specialist"" shop. He said it would explain everything from the lean fuel to the rpm jumps. Thank you all for your insight and help. I should finally have my truck back tomorrow!

I was just wondering if anyone had an idea what this could be.  Lots of car guys around me have no clue what could do this.

When the truck starts, its starts just fine.  I start driving for about a mile, and then for 10 seconds-1 minute, it chugs along with very limited power.  The engine ""ticks"" fairly loudly, and no matter what gear I choose, it just chuggs. Almost like it lost a cylinder or something.  After it has its little fit, it drives without any issues for the remainder of the drive.  If it sits for another 8 hours or so, it will do it again.  It's been happening for months now, and seems to be having its ""fits"" for longer lately, so I'm starting to worry.  I can't reproduce it for my mechanic, but I'm going to leave it overnight at some point so he can test it.

I have a 2000 Saab 9-5 Aero 5-speed with 99K on it. I've been having shifting issues associated *I think* with the clutch hydraulics. In essence, the car is hard to get into 1st and reverse when the engine is turning, but when the car is off, all gears glide very easily and as they should. 

The problem gets worse as the car warms up and gets hot. The input shaft of the transmission is turning even when the clutch is depressed.

First I bled the system, which seemed to help for a drive or two. Then I replaced the master cylinder and did what I thought was a good pressure bleed, as many online sources have recommended. 

That didn't really help either, so I spent a whole afternoon pressure bleeding the system using the bike tire trick (pressurize a bike tire that's been fitted over the reservoir). I ran over a quart of fluid through the system and it seemed to be good –– lots of air came out that I must've missed (or that somehow got into the system). 

On the test drive, all was good. I could get into 1st and reverse with no issues while the engine was on. However, when I got home, I turned off the engine –– and then turned it back on to move the car –– and now it's hard to get the car back into 1st and reverse...as before. I can hear/feel the resistance of the shifter trying to move the gears.

It's too dark now to mess with the car and I'm just really frustrated. 

I know it could be a clutch or slave cylinder. If you know Saabs, you know that a clutch job on a 9-5 is a major expense ($1,100-1,400) and because the slave is inside the bellhousing, you just do that with the clutch. I would do the clutch myself, but it's a huge job and while I'm comfortable doing lots of mechanical work, a clutch job is just beyond my ability and schedule at this moment.

I'm going to take it to a specialist this week to see if he has special Saab bleeding tricks –– or to see if he can diagnose what's actually wrong. 

In the interim, I would like to know if anyone has encountered an issue like this on their own cars. ",,False,,t5_2tkvu,False,,,True,t3_195xdh,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/195xdh/weird_clutch_issue_on_saab_95_aero/,

Turns out , the re and re never did much good for the slipping issue in third, and to this day, everytime it hits third gear it lurches into gear instead of slipping in smoothly as it should. I was thinking the wrong size gear was used as there are two sizes for that year and the mech wasnt sure aboput which tooth sized gear to use at first. He showed us the old one, and yes all the gears had teeth missing.

Any ideas or suggestions?


(Edit) I just thought of something earlier. Now if I were a mech., I wouldn't be asking this silly question, but is it possible that when doing the re and re that the mechanic didn't check over all the cogs and the 'shaft'?And that it could possibly be something else worn out that is causing it to slip? I posted this question almost a year ago and still havent been able to afford to take it to the mechanics again for a inspection, but if I can mayhap pinpoint the issue into a more certain area, it might be easier on the mechanic to do work on the tranny next.

The history is so spotted, that it could be used by the local fire department as a dalmatian. It's been rebuilt at least twice, and the shipped engine (a 4cyl) was replaced with the 3100 and (hopefully) matching transmission.

The clock currently has over 250K miles on it (not sure if that was replaced at some point, as we have no history on it beyond a receipt for new tires at 140K miles) and about 22K of them are mine. (I've owned it for 3.5 years now)

I've tried my best taking care of it, have only had a minor accident involving cracking my back bumper when bumping into an improperly parked UPS truck, and haven't had any other issues with it while I've owned it. Before receiving it as a gift from my mechanic, it had all brake lines replaced, master cylinder replaced, timing belt, alternator, and idler pulley, and besides a slight knocking in the engine it's been bullet proof, no oil leaks or other fluid issues.

As of about a month ago, it started having issues shifting while accelerating. I attributed this at first to my somewhat ""rough"" driving style on interstates (average speed exceeds 80MPH, and getting up to that speed needs to be as fast as possible to avoid being smushed) but it has started going into the lower gears, having problems shifting when going roughly 30mhp from a dead stop to a 60mph street. I still attributed this to my rough handling of the situation (putting my foot rather close to the floor to get up to speed fast) but it's becoming more and more common when just driving normally.

As of the past two weeks, it has had trouble shifting from park into Reverse or Drive, requiring me to put it back into park and try again to make it catch.

This afternoon as I was merging onto the highway, my engine abrubtly quit. I lost power stearing and had 0 rpms. I think the radio may have gone off as well, but I can't say for sure on that point. I was able to pull off to the side (was still on the entrance ramp), and my turn signal/emergency lights still worked. When i got over, I noticed the red engine oil lamp was lit. I turned the ignition to off, and then tried to restart the car, which it successfully did with seemingly no problems. I then drove approximately 2 more miles home, and I did not seem to have any more issues. I checked my engine oil level, which was fine, as well as transmisssion fluid (was a bit dark, but other than that it seemed fine.


For recent repairs, I had blown a spark plug/ignition coils about 3 months ago, which all got repaired at a local goodyear. Maybe 2 months ago, when merging onto the highway, I had thought that then engine had stalled (no acceleration, quick glance seemed to indicate 0 rpms), but in the span of less than a second, it had jumped right back up and seemed to run fine for the rest of that trip. It has had no issues since then.


My only thought for what could have caused this is what my boss suggested before with the engine control module starting to go, but that has not been verified.


If you have any ideas what could be wrong, as well as what it might cost to fix them, it would be greatly appreciated. I will probably be taking it to a mechanic this weekend to at least get the oil changed, so any ideas for what else I may need fixed would help me a great deal.

When they opened everything up, it turned out that I needed a new radiator and condensor since they were right behind the bumper and also got damaged. This wasn't a big deal since the insurance covered it as an additional...i forget the proper word here.

Anyway, I guess I was low priority to this guy b/c my car was with him for 4 weeks when he originally said 1 or 2. One thing that he mentioned around the 3 week mark was that it was all done except they had to replace the coolant.

The first thing that I noticed when i got the car was a weird smell, which I just realized might have been due to a coolant problem, but at the time I thought it was just some odor left from a dirty shop or whatever.

As a sidenote, there ended up being 2 sheet metal screws in one of my tires so I went back there and he fixed that for me a week or two later. Other than that, the car had been running fine after I got it back, and I even drove it a few hundred miles one weekend and it was fine.

Now here starts the main problem:

3 full weeks after I picked the car up, I was driving somewhere about 25 miles away. It was a very cold day, so after 5m I noticed my feet were still cold and I realized that the heat was not working at all. I didn't think much of it, other than being mad at the mechanic. So I continue driving on the highway, and after about 20 miles, the check engine light comes on. At this point, I thought I remembered looking at the temp gauge and it was normal, but the insurance inspector guy I talked to thinks that this is very unlikely. The ""VSC TRAC"" light came on at the same time, which is traction control, but that seems to come on with other lights for some reason all the time.

So I start driving the car easy since I'm almost at my destination. I start to notice the car making a putt-putting noise when I step on the gas. I roll to a slow stop at a traffic light. When it turns green, my car has stalled. It smelled and there was some smoke, so I guess that's where it overheated. At this point, the oil light comes on and maybe another light or two. The time from the check engine light coming on until it overheated was maybe 2 or 3 minutes. Won't start back up, we had to push it to the side of the road and get it towed and in that time there was a big puddle after an hour from something leaking.

The new mechanic says that the engine overheated and it blew a head gasket and they want to charge me 5 hours to open the engine and see how much damage was done.

So I'm about up to the present on this story, but basically it is my belief that there was some sort of slow coolant leak, which is weird b/c it took 3 weeks. Or that maybe the wrong type of coolant was used, but I don't know if that would cause such a drastic problem. I remember the Toyota Dealership said that my factory coolant was good for 100,000 miles, and I had 93k. So maybe if they put cheap coolant in there, this might be the problem?

Well I called the Insurance company and they're not going to cover anything - it'll be between the auto body and me. But they did send the original Appraisor out, and I talked to him last week for about an hour. He basically said that now that the engine has blown, it would be near impossible to try to find the cause of a slow coolant leak. And even if I did, the auto body might cover replacing the coolant or radiator or whatever, but they wouldn't take responsibility for the engine since I guess it was my fault for letting the car get to that point, even though everything happened in 2 or 3 minutes. Now I know I should have pulled the car over immediately, but this still sucks.

So, the appraisor kind of recommended that I just have the new mechanic replace the engine with a used one for a few thousand dollars instead of throwing money away trying to find out the cause of this incident b/c it would be hard and probably wouldn't get me much in return.

So my questions are:

Any idea what could have happened here?

Are there any cheap tests I should ask the mechanic to do? They wanted to take a look inside the engine, but that would be more exploring the effect and how much damage is there, instead of looking for the cause of the problem. Kind of sounded like they assumed there was a ton of damage and it would be better to just look for a new engine.

I'm worried that if I get a used engine, I'll keep running into problems with the car and pumping money into it, so I need to figure out whether to do this, or just cut my losses and get a new car.

If you hold the revs up for maybe a minute or two, the car will run just fine after that.

I was wondering if anyone can offer suggestions in regards to (A) how I should check the things below, and (B) in what order I should diagnose possible problems, (C) is there anything I'm missing?

1.  Dirty throttle body / IAC valve.
2.  Vacuum Leak
3.  Dirty injectors.
4.  Plugs and wires. [Plan on replacing these soon.]
5.  Give up and accept that my ECU is 20 years old and ill-equipped for wisconsin.
6.  ? ? ?

Other things worth noting:

- My friend who is daily driving the car claims there is a large brake bias to the left side of the car under heavy braking. -- We will be replacing all 4 tires later this week so we'll be looking for possible braking issues; but could this be indicative of vacuum problems?
- After adding ISO-Heet, which is basically a combustible alcohol product used as a gas additive meant to remove moisture from the fuel system, the car has done noticably better at cold weather starts. -- It still dies at idle, but the ""warmup period"" before it will run fine on its own is a bit smaller.
- As far as I can tell the IAC is not computer controlled, but simply a set valve. Is there a way to rule out this part being faulty? I'm weary of just setting the idle higher to treat symptoms of a possibly larger problem.
- This Mustang _does not_ have the stock airbox. It's a custom cut piece of pipe fit between the intake and MAF sensor, which is then fit to an after-market cone-filter. Recently this fitting became loose and the filter fell off, the car would bounce its idle around 600-1000rpm until it died [this is normal operating temp; and without user input]. -- Is it possible that we need to consider a different design for this intake?

I am working on a 2005 F150 with a v6 in it. It has about 105,000 on it. The steering was fine but then it arbitrarily started to get a little tough. Not like the power steering was cutting on and off, but it would just get a liiitttlllee harder to steer. The frequency of this occurrence increased over a few weeks as did the magnitude of the force necessary to steer. So the power steering has gotten worse and worse.

The PS fluid doesn't smell ""burnt"" and looks to be free of contaminants and at the proper level. Every time I have done a power steering pump the pump has whined like a mo fo when it went bad so am I safe to assume this PS pump is A-OK?

There are no leaks in the system, and all tie rod ends are good, even the grease boots are in great shape. Cars alignment is good also.

I am not super farmiliar with PS systems but they seem to be simplistic. Could this be a seal failure in the rack or something along those lines? Could the pump be failing without making any noise at all?

The belt is also in great shape and isn't slipping at all.

I thought this was a horrible deal (afterall, we're not about the engine or the transmission or something, we're talking about door locks! this is a very steep price to for car that's not worth very much anymore), but I need to be able to put my wheelchair in the back, so I called other Honda places in town to ask for estimates to replace the actuators in question.

I found a Honda place that gave a total estimate of $427.52 for parts and labor to replace the actuators, so I made an appointment and dropped my vehicle their.

I was driving around and my car seemed to die on me a few days ago. It stalled out and my gas pedal wouldn't respond. I managed to get over and after waiting a few minutes I was able to get it started again and drive home. Since then the car has been unable to start. It will turn over like it's trying to, and even start then die out after I few seconds but it won't idle. 

I have already replaced the whole distributor and flushed my radiator of fluids and even replaced my radiator cap. The battery is also brand new. As of now I'm thinking it might be the main relay or the fuel pump but i have no idea how to check those. When I turn my key all the lights come on in the dash like normal and i can even hear my fuel pump click on and off when the check engine light appears.

**Edit 1:** So I tried to test the fuel pressure by loosening one of the nuts off the fuel filter to see if fuel would just spray out. Fuel does come out but it seems to be more like a trickle rather then spray. Also the tank does have fuel in it. 

**Edit 2**: Okay so I went and replaced the main relay and it still won't start. Like i said earlier, the all my fuses are good and even with a brand spanking new main relay there is no change. This makes me believe that it's the fuel pump that's bad which I hope to god I'm wrong. I really don't want to drop my fuel tank when it's more then 3/4 full

**Edit 3:** Something I noticed about my car is that there is a sticker that says something about an alarm along with a little red LED light near my steering wheel that looks a lot like an alarm of some sort. I purchased my car used and was never told anything about an alarm, or even if its aftermarket or stock. I also cant find any information about 1989 Honda Civics having alarms. This makes me think that it could possibly be a kill switch since my car will turn over and start, but die within a few seconds. Looks like I will be searching for a killswitch tomorrow as well.

**Edit 4:**Yeah we managed to troubleshoot everything else. I went and purchased starter fluid and was able to keep the car running by having my buddy spray into my air intake, which confirmed that it was a fuel issue and not electrical. Kinda made my new dizzy pointless, but it needs to be replaced often so whatever.

Just to be sure I went and used electrical cleaner on a lot of my cables because of my paranoia. Wanted to make sure no moisture was in my plugs. I also cleaned my grounds to make sure there was no carbon build up. I even cleaned out my IACV just to check for air bubbles.

Someone mentioned a vacuum leak, but I havent been able to find one so I kinda doubt its that.

Tomorrow I am gonna take a look at my fuel pump and check for a ruptured line (Easier fix) since I don't really have cash to be throwing around on a brand new fuel pump.",,False,,t5_2tkvu,1357615317.0,,,True,t3_16177v,http://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/16177v/1989_honda_civic_standard_hatchback_wont_start/,

Mechanic called to say he replaced the wheel bearing but the timing belt broke and it bent a valve. He estimated the repairs would be $2,000.

He said he had test drove it. Parked it and turned it off. Then he started it again and the belt broke.

We paid for the repairs he did and paid to have the car towed home. 
Tonight I pulled off the valve cover and the belt looks great. It is half way through it's lifespan. The teeth look good.

I'm no mechanic but the valves look like they're all even. 

The car is 1995 Geo Prizm 1.6L. Depending on the source online it is either a non-interference or an interference engine. Real helpful. Gates.com lists it as a non-interference engine.  

We had never thought to try to start it, we just had it towed. 

Should we just put it all back together and try starting it? Is there an easy way to tell if the valves are bent?

EDIT:

Put the valve cover back on and started the car up. It took a moment, but it started right up. Drove it around and it seems to be fine other than a slight vibration that wasn't there before. Perhaps my turning of the cam pulley threw off the timing. At any rate the car seems to be fine. SO is scared to drive her car still ... because the mechanic said it was broken.

Is there anything I can do to let it burp without having it spew?

1. Popped the hood and took off the cap from the overflow tank. Started the car and turned on the fan + heat.
1. Bled the radiator until I saw they stopped for a minute or so. Kicked on the A/c + heat just to make sure nothing was left. Nada.
1. Put the cap on the radiator and took the car for a spin. Hit the expressway on my loop and the car kicked up to 235 deg (red is 260, mid is 210) and started to get worried.
1. As I was idling at a light to make the last leg of my loop, it has been at ~235 for about 30 seconds before it dropped down to ~215.
1. Started back down my street when it jumped back up to ~235.

First off, is there anything that is known to go wrong with these at a certain time?  I've got about 212,600 miles on it, and had the engine rebuilt last year (it's got about 12,000 miles on it).  The transfer case has been replaced, but that wasn't a new one, just lower mileage.  Beyond that, I haven't had much major work done to it, just maintenance and a few small repairs.  I'm going to be getting all the fluids changed out in the next couple months (just financial restrictions), and I have to get my brake booster replaced as well.

Last winter, I got stuck in some snow (had shitty tires, but those were recently replaced with Hankook Dynapro ATM's in September) and after trying unsuccessfully to get out on my own, I had to dig my way out.  I did however notice after that, that every time I have it in 4WD Hi or Full time (all wheel drive), it makes a clicking noise up front when I have my wheels turned sharp (like turning into a parking spot).  I wasn't sure what it was, and it never makes the noise in 2WD or when I'm just driving straight or going around a soft curve.  Any ideas of what that may be?
