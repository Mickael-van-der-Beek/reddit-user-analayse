One night we heard her dad coming down, so I jumped across the hall into her brother's room (he was not living there any more) and I jumped into the closet. I heard her dad go through her room, then when the lights came on in my room I knew I was fucked. He opened the closet and I was sitting there looking up at him. He said ""you get out"". I did.

Bit of backstory: 

It was my third Christmas in the United States, and my first in a house that my parents had bought quite recently (back in the day). After being bombarded with the American ""dogs are a man's best friend"" culture, I really wanted a puppy. On top of that, they were also really cute. Obviously we weren't in a great financial situation, not to mention my mom hates dogs. So Santa decided to send me a nice, typed-up letter explaining why he couldn't deliver that year.

I read some of the posts here and being a Korean-American girl raised by fairly strict, religious (yet loving) parents, I can obviously relate a lot. Despite all the comparing, yelling, shoe-throwing, and the like, however, my parents really did love me. And this letter is one of the tangible proofs of Asian parent love from my childhood. :) ",,False,self,t5_2u8j6,False,,,True,t3_166cdh,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/166cdh/pretty_late_but_recently_found_a_letter_from/,

When I began dating my SO I ended up meeting her mother fairly quickly (and hilariously but that's another tale) and we got along swell; however, it wasn't until nearly 3 years later that I ended up meeting her father as he was overseas working. 

Now a bit of background on her father, he was a very non-nonsense, straightforward, Buddhist, Asian (Chinese-Malaysian), Engineer who trained zealously in martial arts. He had raised my SO more akin to a son than a daughter so his expectations in any male his daughters chose as boyfriend were rather high (because she was both his first born and the one he invested the most effort into).

Maybe a month before her mother's birthday, my SO tells me that her dad will be coming down to stay for a few months so I would finally be properly introduce (beforehand she had only mentioned me in passing). Needless to say, I'm a tad nervous as her father has been built up in my mind to be an amalgamation of Bruce Lee and Hercules. It also doesn't help that it seemed to me that I was the last thing an Asian parent would want their daughter to bring home: an Arts major with messy hair who dressed like a Bohemian and spent a great deal of the time distracting said daughter (who was a very talent Molecular Biology student) with videogames, city exploration, naps, laziness, pleasures, shenanigans, and fripperies.

The day finally arrives and, as had become tradition at her household, I brought a cake to celebrate. Lo and behold, who else opens the door but my SO's father. To be fair he wasn't nearly has big or as muscled as I imagined (he was in his late 50s) but his build denoted that he had seen quite a few fights in his day (cauliflower ears, thick/muscled torso, toned arms, etc) and, like his offspring, wore a signature scowl on his face (thankfully I have the unique ability to remove that scowl from the SO's face). Her father gives me the once over, takes the cake from my hands, throws me a $20, and shuts the door. I'm stunned for a good 15 seconds, however, I knock again to try and figure out what's up. Her father again appears, scowl unmoved, and glares at me before shouting back into the apartment, ""Mazroll's SO, grab me my wallet, the delivery boy wants a tip!"" Without going over all the laughter that my SO and her mother had when seeing who the delivery boy was, that was my first encounter with my SO's father,

As time went on he actually ended up taking a liking to me and we came to a mutual respect for one another -- as much of one that can be established between a father and the guy he knows is banging his daughter -- and when I told him I was wanting to marry his daughter he said something very profound to me. He paused for a moment, thinking very hard, and said to me **""Chris, you speak strange, your head is in the clouds, and you can be very foolhardy but you treat my daughter well, make her smile, and your heart is honest so I support your choice. Of course if you're talking about her sister I'm going to fly back to Toronto and kick your ass.""**

The guy was a Loki but he was awesome and I was deeply saddened when only a year later I flew half-way around the world to bury him.

1346789632.0,95,self.AsianParentStories,zcpr8,My mother probably give me two strokes and is working on a third.,branchero,111,16,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/zcpr8/my_mother_probably_give_me_two_strokes_and_is/,"Hi this is Branchero, one of your moderators. Have you been wondering where I've been? I have been in/am in inpatient rehab recovering from a stroke. I had it two weeks ago when I came to visit my parents. Which happened to be a long way from home.

The stroke affected my right side. I have to significantly rehab my right arm/hand/leg/foot. My left side is ok. So is the rest of my brain (supposedly). Most of this post is written with Mountain Lion’s dictation feature. 

A CAT scan revealed that I had a previous stroke. They had no idea what the timeframe was. But they could tell me in general what the symptoms would’ve been like. I knew instantly when it had been. Last Thanksgiving. Which would be the previous time I saw my mother.

My mother spent two days with me in the hospital when my GF had to jet home to get our dogs to a kennel (her nephew had been dogsitting for a week and a half). My mother has visited me every day in the hospital and rehab center since then.

The following is a list of what she has pulled so far:

* Inane questions. So many inane questions. Asked to everyone.
* She routinely stole food from my meal trays because it was “free”. The nurse saw this and forced her to order a guest tray.
* She cannibalized furniture from several rooms to use 100% of the free space in my hospital room to arrange her own suite. I had to go into the hallway to do therapy.
* Picked up a packet of saltines that were sitting on my tray. It was not offered to her. She rustled it for about five minutes then put it down. It was still not offered to her. So she picked it up again and rustled it for 20 minutes.
* After every nurse and doctor came to visit me she would follow them out into the hallway to ask more stupid questions. My neurologist was trapped for over an hour.
* She mentioned that most patients that were here when we got to the rehab center were now gone. I got chastised for taking so long to get better.
* Has multiple times helped herself to food in the room. Important now because I have a VERY narrow selection of foods I can eat. Last time she stood up, turned her back to us, and started crunching away.
* Last night we hid all of the food in the room. She started eating salt substitute.
* Asked the nurse if the thermometer was broken because it registered 98.6F which was “too exact”.
* Managed to confuse the social worker so much that they thought I wanted to be transferred to a hospital in the middle of nowhere.
* The two days when she was with me in the hospital, visitors I barely knew came all day. Visitors for my mother. When I mentioned that was having hard time sleeping and rehabbing under these conditions, my mother told me “Don’t be selfish. This isn’t about you. Is for them to feel happy. Your stroke made them sad.”
* Requires a daily demonstration of most body parts and how they are working.
* Probably three more pages of this. But I can feel my blood pressure spiking. Pretty much what got me here in the first place.

I'll give you some back story. I'm half Korean and half Mexican, mom and dad accordingly. So of course my mom has always been the strict one when it came to school. Great was never enough, it had to be perfect, and well let's say there was/is pressure from her. I was raised like this, while my dad never really said anything about school other than I should have even better grades. 

So fast forward, I'm in college abroad, on my own, and switched majors twice, since it wasn't what I wanted, much to my mom's dismay. I get into economics but had always been a science person so I didn't really understand much, but it didn't matter I just needed to work harder and get results. But this year, I switched houses 3 times, was kicked out of a house by a greedy landlord, moved to a temporary home, then with a girl made it impossible to study at all, then to a friends couch, then the greedy landlord tried to sue/drain me of money for damages that happened after I left. 

Needless to say at the end I didn't pass the year and was of course very distraught, and had to break the news to my family. My brother chastised me, undermined me, etc... My dad kept saying how he knew I wasn't good enough for school and I should just start working because I wasn't capable of any better. And surprisingly my mom who I left last because I thought she would be the most severe, was comforting me, she wanted me to succeed, to thrive and to get back up and fight harder next year, she gave me advice and hope. She was what I would see on TV and movies, I bawled and she just stayed on the phone comforting me. I had never seen that side of her, she had always been very strict when it came to studies, and here she was, the only person that was rooting for me, and wanted me to pull through the hard times. 

So yeah I thought it would be good to share this, because I see a lot of posts where parents are strict beyond reason, but sometimes it's the Asian parents that are the best ones.",,False,self,t5_2u8j6,False,,,True,t3_1ib0gm,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1ib0gm/my_asian_mother_just_gave_me_hope/,

Due to moving circumstances, my fiance (white) and I had to live for slightly under a month with his parents. 
 
His mother is a ""life coach"" and is paid around a hundred dollars per hour. You would think this might be a good source of income, but she only actually works around two hours a week, due to her being ""tired"" or ""feeling slightly sick"". Some of this probably stems from her eating and growing up on mostly fast food and little else, which my fiance says he also grew up on, and causes him to have a sensitive system too. Every time she actually does work, she throws a fit for days afterwards about how much she has helped everyone in her life and how they owe her everything. Every time a bill would come, she would scream bloody murder about how she ""can't deal with the stress anymore"".  She's not very good with money, and she would literally buy $300 worth of groceries twice a week. Her pantry was stocked more based on what she thinks should be there rather than what anyone actually eats. Her husband cleans and cooks and does everything for her, while she sits around all week except for the 2 hours she works. Everyday she did one task or chore, like going to the bank, going grocery shopping, doing laundry, etc and came home and screamed about all she had to do. There are some many other issues but the point is, she is basically  the definition of self-entitlement.

How does this relate to my mother? 

Both my mom and my dad worked full time jobs. He was a chef at a chinese restaurant, and she usually worked general labor jobs like working in factories or being a maid, since she didn't know much english. She somehow still managed to make time to make all our meals from scratch every single day so we didn't have to worry about lunch or dinner when she wasn't around. She cleaned and paid the bills and did all the chores, and I never did anything around the house because she wanted me to focus on my studies. She never took a day off work, and she would never think of living like my fiance's mother does. I never realized how much she did as a child, and I thought that's what moms were supposed to do. 

I know not all people are these two extremes, but it's really made me realize how different viewpoints are from different classes of people.

I work extremely hard and I haven’t really been someone who needs to be pushed to work hard. I do it automatically because doing well and being successful is one of my ultimate goals in life.

I have been with my boyfriend for 1 year and 4 months now. We started dating a few months into going starting university and met through mutual friends, which means we don’t go to the same university, nor do we live in the same town which does make it very difficult to see each other. My parents have always been against relationships whilst I’m young and have always told my sisters, brother and I to steer away from relationships until we have finished studying. For this reason, I did not tell my parents about my boyfriend, which for obvious reasons made it hard to speak to each other and see each other when my parents were around.

Last December 2012, I travelled to Bristol to meet my boyfriend and his friend for a night out. I had to cover and tell my dad that I was going out to the Student Union with the cheerleaders and to keep him happy, I said that I would text him when I got in. At the club, unfortunately I was pickpocketed and my purse and phone was stolen which meant I was unable to contact my dad. My dad had gone through my phone bill contacts, calling and texting everyone I had contacted recently and more and many people contacted my boyfriend to ask where I was. I finally contacted my dad, but I could not deal with it myself. One of the numbers he rung was my boyfriend as I had contacted him last. He started to scream down the phone at me, so I passed him onto my boyfriend who was also screamed at. My dad accused him of kidnapping me and threatened to contact the police. Following the phone call, my boyfriend and I went to the closest police station and let them know what happened between myself and my dad and also reported the pickpocketing.

A few days after, I had discovered that my dad had re-ordered my phone simcard and started texting people from my phone. He had also taken £6000+ from my bank which left me in a financial struggle. I had no ID and he had refused to give back my passport. From this weekend onwards, he had cut me off and refused any support which has left me paying for my own rent and food etc at university.

I have not spoken to my dad since, yet I’m still in contact with my mum. The other day I texted my mum to get details from her so that I could get a new passport. My dad borrowed my mum’s phone, reading all the messages on her phone from me and then burnt my passport in front of her.

So my mom calls me 8 times yesterday and I call her back, thinking that it's some sort of emergency. Nope. She proceeds to tell me to not to take the job that I got, and come home to live with them instead. She says that the whole purpose of sending me to America in the first place was so that I could pursue my studies, not so that I could date some boy. She said that I was a disappointment to her an the rest of my family, and that I was a source of misery for all of them. She said I should be ashamed of myself for basically stealing their money, and accused me of being a thief. She called me a selfish ingrate of a daughter who doesn't know a thing about the real world, and she said I was an idiot for thinking that I could survive without their help. She said that I was the problem with this family and that I should change, and suggested that I stop blaming them for what are clearly my faults and shortcomings. She said I was exactly like my father, a stubborn, selfish, self-centered asshole.

I tried to explain to her that my dad's behavior in the past built a sense of distrust and anxiety in me, and that I couldn't live under the same roof as him. I told her that because of him, I went through a lot of therapy and went on antidepressants. She didn't care. She told me it was my fault I felt this way, and I had absolutely no right to hold any grudges because it was all in the past, and that I made her and the rest of my family (dad and grandma) feel just as bad if not worse. 

I'm also confused because she seems to believe that she can still force me to do things. She said if I continued to be disobedient she would drag me home. I asked her how she would do this and she informed me that she would sneak into my home and pack all my things and throw them out. This confused the shit out of me because she doesn't know where I live or have access to my keys, and what she is threatening to do is against the law. But moving on.

It all came out. I didn't go to med school, I didn't go to law school, I didn't hang out with other Koreans, I didn't participate in any extracurricular activities in high school, she never pushed me to work harder, I dated whoever I wanted, I basically have made my own choices all along and I have no reason to be depressed. The crux of the problem is that my parents seem me as not my own person, but an extension of themselves. They believe my life is a joint decision, a notion which I disagree with. I feel completely entitled to dictate my future, but I can't express that opinion without coming off as a total ingrate.

She threatened to cut me out of her life, and I asked her if she actually meant that. She screamed at me and told me I was being rude. Apparently if I ask a question she doesn't want to answer, I'm being rude, I guess...? I asked her what she wanted me to do, if she wanted me to just obey them and go against my will, and she informed me that I should change my will to match theirs somewhat. She also accused me of being a slut (I've slept with two boyfriends, lul) and even brought my dead grandfather into the equation, saying that he can see everything I do and asked me if I honestly had nothing to be ashamed of. I said no, because I don't. I also told her I don't believe in God and the afterlife, and she called me closed-minded.

Now, for those who were previously accusing me of being petulant and immature, I took your advice and didn't write an e-mail. I spoke to her over the phone, as close as it gets to being in person, and I was completely honest about my emotions. I never once raised my voice even though she was screaming hysterically at me, and I asked questions that I thought would facilitate the discussion, which she refused to answer and continued to resort to ad hominems. I'm very hurt, and I have no idea what to do at this point. I really have tried my best to communicate with them the best way I know how. I see no option other than to follow up on their threat to cut me out and tell them to do whatever makes them happy.

I see this all as a huge manipulation attempt to get me to do what they want. I might be wrong, but I find it hard to believe that a grown woman would be THIS delusional. It's brutal because parents have this magnetic force that sucks me into an alternate reality in which I'm wrong and they're right, I'm a horrible person and they are good. I feel like my whole world is turning upside down and my values are being questioned when I'm speaking to them, and it makes me really uneasy. I hope that last part made sense.

In grade school, Art class teachers were never ever allowed to grade on artistic skill. Grades for art were on whether work was completed using required materials/techniques. Which meant if we needed sketch something in charcoal, the only way you can lose marks was to not hand it in or use pencil crayons; if it was a bowl of fruit you needed to sketch you could literally handed in a solid black charcoal covered paper and explain it as being in a dark room and perfect mark.

Naturally art class was something you can regularly get A+ and usually a couple kids in the class got 100%.

Having an asian parent, I was constantly ""encouraged"" to get 100% in every class.

One year, the teacher decided we could occasionally do bonus assignments to make up our marks. Essentially it was a way to let the slacker ""round-eyes"" (my mothers jokingly racist label for non oriental kids) make up marks they missed. So I decided to do a couple just because I liked art class. 

At the end of the year I get report card showing 100% in art (and in science and math) and a letter to my parents from the art teacher. He wanted to let them know I actually exceeded 100% in art class but there was no way for him to record it; if he could he would have recorded 105% for all the extra assignments I did.

""Why didn't you get 105% in Math and Science too??""

TL;DR: got 105% in art class by doing extra assignments. Parents then expected same grades for Math and Science, because 100% wasn't high enough.",,False,self,t5_2u8j6,False,,,True,t3_1gbkdf,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1gbkdf/school_grades/,

I'm an ABC (American Born Chinese) who grew up with two older brothers and raised by a single immigrant mom. Thanks to the major fuck-ups of my oldest brother, my mom was determined to make middle brother and youngest child (me) into good, obedient children. My middle brother was obedient but I was more of a troublemaker. I wasn't a terrible child, but I had my tempers and put up fights sometimes. And I always had an independent streak in me; I didn't submit to authority without questioning.

Come high school, my mom really tightened the grip on me, because this was where my oldest brother went wayward and got into the wrong crowd, and ended up being what my mom deems 'a failure.' I was not allowed to go much of anywhere after school; I had to come straight home. And if I was going to be late, I had to call home and tell why or I would be yelled at. If I wanted to go to the movies, my mom would ask me a million questions about who I was going with, where I was going to be, what time I was coming home...all the way up to getting the phone numbers of my friends AND their parents. I was accused of socializing too much with boys, and that I would drop out of school and become homeless. Sleepovers and parties were so out of the question. So pretty much, I was not allowed a social life. Should sound pretty familiar to some of you at least.

Sophomore year of high school, I decided that I wanted to join a sport and I chose softball. I told my mom that I wanted to try to join, and she immediately turned it down, saying that it would take too much time away from homework, studying, and sleeping. After some arguing though, I finally got her to agree to me going to after school practices so I could at least try out for the team. I ended up really liking the sport, the coaches, and even made a good friend. I worked hard to learn the sport and come try-outs, I was told that the coaches really liked me for my determination and wanted to put me on the varsity team.

I was ecstatic and went home to tell my mom that I made the varsity team - ""They want me to put me on the better team! They think I'm good and I have potential!"" But of course, she instead said ""no"" and proceeded to say that I had already had my 'fun' and should be happy and focus on my schoolwork again. I was pissed off. Pissed off that I had worked so hard just to be rejected and not given a chance to prove that I could do both a sport and uphold my grades. Pissed that she didn't support me or have confidence in me. I guess that's what really started the 'rebellion' in me, because I had a fit and we argued until she reluctantly agreed that I could be on the team - but if my grades slipped, I would quit immediately. (And did my grades slip? NO!) 

Junior year of high school was absolute hell for me, because it was the height of my rebellion and also we were having HUGE family issues. I ended up taking a somewhat childish approach to rebelling against my mother - we have communication issues and I could never seem to get her to understand my logic and reasoning, so I resorted to just doing what I wanted even if she didn't like it. If I wanted to go out somewhere, I would tell her I was going and where I'd be, but if she said no I would still go anyway. I had a job and had my own money, so I wasn't dependent on her for spending money. There were some truly upsetting times where she threatened that if I left the house, she would change all the locks and I would never be able to come back in anymore. I believed her at times, but I still did it because I knew I had friends and family that would let me stay with them if it ever did happen (it didn't).

I didn't get mixed up in drugs or alcohol, I didn't get myself killed or put into jail. I just wanted some freedom and independence, and not have my mom hovering over my shoulder watching like a hawk every second of my day. The 'method' eventually worked. I guess after a while, my mom finally understood that I was grown and she can't bend me to her will anymore.

 I'm now 20 years old, about to enter my third year of college and I am living on my own in an apartment (something my mom also tried to fight me on, but of course I won out again because I had the means to get it and she couldn't physically stop me). I've held a job since I entered college and I pay for all of my own expenses. I play underwater hockey and I still uphold a pretty decent GPA. I have a boyfriend (something my mom doesn't know nor approves of yet).

Although my mom hasn't completely relaxed her grip on me yet, I feel that she is allowing me to be pretty independent and be my own person. Just last week when I visited home, I was able to go out all day with minimal questions asked. I believe that this would not be the case if I had not decided to rebel in high school and take a stand for myself.

**(TL;DR: I rebelled in high school by doing what I wanted and it eventually worked. I am now an independent and mostly happy adult.)**

As a result, we get the stories on this subreddit.

But I realize now, post college and living/working on my own, that my parents were amazing parents to me, who went out of their comfort zone to give me the best childhood they could imagine. And I just wanted to share with you all, to show an example that some Asian parents are great parents. 

They encouraged me to be active and play sports, and even when I told them I decided on a physically challenging and borderline dangerous high school sport, they told me to go ahead. They even went to my competitions. When my grades dipped a little because of practices, they didn't ask me to quit, they knew how important it was to me.

My dad specifically pushed me to learn more. But rather than just tell me to study, he would sit with me and we would do puzzles and math challenges together. He may have been a little eager though - for example, my 11 year old self refused to believe in radians. I credit him for my degree in a tech field, because his efforts made me love math and problem solving, not hate it.

Mom encouraged me to play music and do art, though I wasn't much of an artist, haha. I liked music though. I also really liked video games, which she didn't encourage, but didn't prevent me from playing either.

And they both knew how important friends were. As long as I finished my work, I could go to my friend's house to play Timesplitters 2 all night, or later on to just ""hang"". They loved all my friends (though they would specifically ask me about the smart girls in my class...). I had plenty of non-Asian friends, such that I really felt that being Asian was no big deal.

And if that's what my parents wanted, for me to feel like I belong, they did a damn good job.

I think I finally have part of the answer: 


My parents are Korean. Korean society has changed a lot since they left, but one thing that seems constant is the classification of children as Good Kids or Bad Kids. There's a pervasive idea that if you're a Good Kid, you don't do X, Y, and Z. The [Tablo controversy](http://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/04/ff_koreanrapper/) reeks of this mentality -- Good Kids aren't interested in non-serious things like hip-hop, so Tablo couldn't possibly have excelled at Stanford *and* made it as a rapper.


So, my parents. According to their worldview when I was growing up, a truly Good Kid (not just some impostor who gets 90%s instead of 100%s, mind you) was not interested in:

* dating
* pop culture
* TV
* makeup
* piercings
* fashion
* parties
* extracurriculars -- sort of. It was okay to have ECs but being too invested was a big no-no.


This explains why, for example, my parents freaked the fuck out when I said I wanted to wear makeup in middle school. Kept putting off taking me to get my ears pierced. Made me feel bad for watching and enjoying TV. Got hysterical over a totally innocent friendship with a boy. And parties? Forget it. According to them, I couldn't do those and be a good student/person.


They wouldn't have budged even if I told them until I was blue in the face that the most high-achieving person at my school (and my academic rival) had been wearing makeup since elementary school, always had the most fashionable clothes, was in the popular crowd (= parties), wore the biggest, fanciest navel ring ever, had a boyfriend, and so on. Somehow, despite doing all those Bad Kid things, she's now a doctor. Amazing, I know.

My mom remarried with a *much, much* older man than her (my mum was 41 and there's ~13 years difference). After remarrying, we decided to move into the US because of my ""education"" right after my 12th birthday. 

All was well. So far. 

When I was a freshman in high school, I had a pretty awesome group of friends. After freshman year, I became close to a guy friend of mine (let's call him John) and he eventually became one of my best friends. 

We hung out often during the summer post freshman/pre sophomore year of high school. We went bowling almost everyday. I didn't specifically tell my parents who I was going with; just some friends. During this time, another guy friend ended up asking me to be his gf and we went out for a short while in the summer. 

On the last night of the summer before school started, my friends and I all hung out for one last time before we parted ways. My girl best friend (let's call her Ana) was going to an art school, he and I were going to the same high school. I came back home around 8, Ana and her mom drove me home. Exhausted, I made the mistake of (being trustful and oblivious) leaving my purse with *my diary* full of calling my dad an asshole, curses, the discussion with my former boyfriend about our relationship and how his brother advised him to keep a condom in his wallet, about Ana and our *personal* discussions, etc in our living room. 

I didn't notice this at all that night.

The next day, I woke up and right away I thought *something feels off* and for some reason I started crying. 

My (step) dad burst into my room with his vein popping out of his forehead, his eye burning with rage, disappointments, and disgust. He screamed and shouted at me. ""Look at what you've done to your mother! You're disgusting! Why don't you just stand at the corner and WHORE yourself out?!"". These were the phrases uttered past his 58 year old lips. ""Let's go to the doctor! I wanna know if you're still a virgin!"" I cried and cried. I bawled and sobbed. I wanted to die. He accused me of being a liar. He read my diary. 

This was the beginning of my depression. 

After this, he once parked across the street from my school to wait for me. He spotted me with John and became agitated by the fact that I was hanging out with a guy, especially him--a person that my dad had instructed me to *never speak to John and Ana. AGAIN*. My dad asked me what John and I were talking about as we were walking home. I told him the truth with a hint of hope that my dad would not believe me to be a liar. But, he was became angrier at me. We got home, out of rage he told me to pack my things and get out. With nowhere to go, my mom crying profusely, I stepped outside and called Ana. I sobbed and asked her if she could take me in. She ensured me her parents and her are on their way over to pick me up from hell. I acted like I had hung up the phone but Ana was still on the other line. My dad screaming and cursing at the top of his lungs at me as walked back to my room to pack, I choked and held back my tears. Ana was listening on the other side. Occasionally, I'd whisper, ""Did you hear that?"" To her through the phone. There maybe a God out there because *thankfully* one of my neighbors called the police. 

The police came and asked me why I'm packing, was I running away? To which I answered no, he told me to get out. And the officers told my dad that he has to put up with me because I was still 16--a minor. 


Ana arrived and parked in front of my house. One of the police officers went outside to talk to her and her parents, but not allowing them to come in/get in contact with me. They left, I had to stay in the house. For some reason, all of my sobbing stopped, I switched off to reading a copy of *Lipstick Jungle* lying around on my floor next to the pile of books to be donated when my dad stomped angrily into my room. I kept at my book, not losing focus at the pages I was attentively ""reading"". ""Because of you,"" he wags his finger at me, ""I have something on my record...because of you!"" He exits. 

A few moments after, I found myself letting out a laughter only heard in the halls of an insane asylum. I don't know why but it felt appropriate at the time. I wasn't laughing at anything funny. I honestly still don't know why I did that. 

Long story short, arguments and his meddlings have and is still putting a strain on my mental health. Arguments and encounters have lead to three police involvements. I've been kicked out of the house 5, 6 or 7 times (I've lost count), but am playing it off by ""swallowing my pride"" and apologizing every time. I can't leave the house. Yet. I'm going to college using his benefits. Even though its a violation of Federal laws and school regulations, he has my school password and goes through my school emails, essays, and my paycheck (I work on campus). He made me sign a FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act...I think) Release form stating that it gave him the rights to my password (I didn't know what its specific function at the time of my signing it, until I, myself, started working as a student worker for the school's administration) and I I change it, he will flip and accuse me of having somethind to hide. And believe me, I have used the ""system made me change it because it expired"" excuse. 

So yeah. 

Welcome to Hell.

1. I did not make this post because I was sad/angry/upset that my mom didn't ""throw me a party."" I was simply amused by her very typical, Asian parent response and thought you guys would relate.

2. I live independently and pay all of my own bills.

Mine: my parents actually let me throw a party at a local arcade.  Because they think that video games are a waste of time and an activity for lazy, stupid kids, they opt for the smallest token package possible. Kids are running out in under five minutes. They complained to my parents, who told them to reach into my pockets and take mine, because I needed to learn to share. 

My cousin's party (which I attended):


-Some distant relative was an old German lady. From her, they got a traditional Black Forest cake. Loaded with liquor. The kids were five. Everyone got drunk, nobody knew what drunk was. I just thought this is what it felt like when you had a lot of fun. I chased that high for years, never reaching it and mistakenly thinking I was not having fun. 


-One of the party games was to blow up a balloon until it exploded. My aunt said it was a game she played as a child. Note: this is scary as hell and hurts (maybe because I was 5, haven't tried it since). After the first two kids succeeded and subsequently were sitting on the floor crying, all the other kids put down their balloons. Nobody claimed the third place prize. 


-The main thing to drink was some apple cider they had bought the previous month and stored outside on the porch. Sadly, it wasn't hard, just spoiled. 


-There was pizza. The things were sprinkled with dried, ground Thai chiles because my aunt thought the pizza was bland. Ever see a group of mostly white five year olds eating anything with Thai chiles? Too bad we weren't drunk yet. 


-The prizes for the games (including that crazy balloon suicide bomber game) were math workbooks. Not new ones either, filled out ones my cousin had already completed. My cousin himself actually said something to his mother about this. Her answer ""They have right answer so they can check""


-(I found the full story out years later) so, during the party, my cousin unwrapped all the presents but opened nothing. This was because he was under orders not to open anything or else he would get grounded. That's because, that next Monday, his mother was going to bring them all to the local Kmart to try and get a refund. Not having thought ahead to get receipts, this didn't work.

Last night, my class ended at 10pm, so ideally I would be back around 10:30. I was not back until 10:45 and they start calling me. I know it's because they are worried and they care about me, but it just pisses me off that they are waiting up for me. When I have to come back late, they complain that they didn't get enough sleep because they stayed up for me. I tell them--that's your fault, not mine. It pisses the hell out of me that it seems like they have nothing better to do than unnecessarily worry about me. It pisses me off that I still need to explain to them if I'm going to be 15 mins late. I know it's because they are worried but I can't help feeling this way. They call me an ungrateful child--that I should be thankful they care about me. They tell me I'm just a girl, that they fear the dangers of the outside world.. MEN, rape, pregnancy, car accidents, kidnappings. I know that. The world can be a scary place. But them staying up for me doesn't create some sort of magical force field to protect me. It does NOTHING.

I just want them to give me some space, some privacy, and treat me like an adult. I get so angry thinking about it. I think such mean and selfish things, like ""Why are they so obsessed with me?"" or ""Why can't they get a life / find a hobby?"" Then I remind myself that I am their life. I'm their child. But why does it have to feel so shitty?

I can't understand this. Maybe I'm just immature. Friends tell me, it gets better as you get older. But does it *really?*

I had wanted one since high school, but I knew my parents hated the idea of it.  Well now they couldn't really do anything about it.

When I flew home at the end of the term, my dad greeted me at the suitcase trolley thing (he had somehow snuck past the one-way door).  

""Hi son,"" he said.  ""Looks like you've been working out a bit?""  

""Yep,"" I replied.  He glances at my piercing but doesn't say anything - he's pretty chill at times.  And he knows I'm going to get it from my mom.

So I push my luggage out of the place with one of those carts and see my mom out waiting for us.  I give her a hug and say hi, she asks me how the flight was etc.  So as I'm explaining things to her, we're walking through the terminal.  I suddenly realize that she's no longer beside me, and I look back over my shoulder to see that she's just standing 10 paces back or so, completely frozen.  I say, ""what's wrong, mom?""

""petriomelony... PLEASE,"" she moans.

""What?"" I asked, confused.

""PLEASE.  Please..."" she continues.

""Please what, mom?"" I asked, exasperated.

""PLEASE take it out.""  she finishes.

I start laughing because this was the kind of reaction I had been expecting.  She begged me to take it out the whole walk to the car, the whole car ride home, etc.

Later that night, she confronts me about it, and says some pretty ridiculous stuff.  This is probably the best part.

""I can't sleep because all I can think about is how I've failed at raising you properly.""

""Why did you get that piercing?  Did a girl tell you to get it?""

""Is this because you want to be a teacher instead of an engineer?  Well fine, be a teacher - just take out that piercing!""

1364997363.0,44,self.AsianParentStories,1bl4xm,"My parents, especially my dad, love to call me selfish when I do something individualistic. Ironically, they don't realize that they're even more selfish.",floatinglotus,53,9,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1bl4xm/my_parents_especially_my_dad_love_to_call_me/,"Ever since I was a child, my parents have always called me selfish (and, consequently, I'd also sometimes get called unfilial) for various reasons. It started when I was a kid and, because I wanted to have time for other things (as kids typically do), I would complain when I was asked to help my sister with her homework. While, yes, I should've known better, in fairness to myself, I was a kid at that time, and sometimes, I felt they were just being unfair because I studied hard yet they'd sometimes want me to not only teach her, but to also do her homework for her.

Anyway, I've always been a bit more individualistic than the rest of my family, especially since I socialize more (only compared to them, mind you - I'm still very shy compared to everyone else) and have been exposed to different world views. Their impression of me as selfish, though, has always stuck, and they call me selfish on a regular basis, for reasons such as:

* Not wanting to do my younger siblings' homework. That sibling I felt too lazy to teach as a kid is all grown up, but I have younger siblings whose study habits aren't that good. There have been several instances of them forgetting to do their homework, only to remember that they have homework due when they're about to sleep. Since my parents ""feel sorry"" for them, I'm expected to do their homework. Even when I get home late from work, exhausted, they sometimes demand that I do her homework because their logic is that I don't do anything when work hours end, anyway. I just keep resisting the urge to argue that my mom is at home pretty much all day, so she could at least help out. I feel that this is unfair because I did well in school by doing my own homework, and doing my siblings' homework for them will not help them learn responsibility. Yet they say that as the oldest, and as the achiever, I have to share my talent by doing their homework. They even guilt-trip me by giving me BS about how I'm arrogant because I can't be bothered to do my younger siblings' homework. They even outright said that what I said about ""fairness"" was wrong. Yet when my siblings' tutor agreed with me, my mom saved face by nodding along with the tutor.

* Daring to think differently from them and wanting to choose my own happiness. Many times, I have been called selfish just because I didn't agree with their views. My dad thinks that this generation is too individualistic, and is therefore selfish.

* Not being busy when they're busy. Just recently, we were packing for a family vacation. Two nights before the departure date, I packed my things so that I wouldn't be stressed out and cramming, as they are prone to do. Besides, they yelled at me for not yet having packed, so I thought that that would shut them up. So the night before we left, they were packing, and I was unwinding from a long day at work by browsing the Internet. Surprise - my dad barges into the room and yells that he hates seeing me on the computer, and that I should be helping out because everyone's busy. WTF; so I apparently am supposed to look busy just because everyone else is. Mind you, I know that I could help out in other ways, i.e. do chores that they can't do because they're packing. But at that time, no dishes needed to be washed, and they wanted to pack their things on their own, yet my dad even cussed me and, again, used his favorite term. Meanwhile, my sister, who was at home all day but took a long nap, just started to pack because she was too lazy to pack the past few days. She didn't get yelled at; in fact, they even offered to help her pack her things. I asked them calmly how that was fair; instead, I got yelled at again, because apparently, my using the computer was in bad taste. I did wash some dishes that they used while eating a late dinner, but no one took notice of that.

So I'm selfish for reasons like that, but meanwhile, here are some of the shit my parents have said/did:

* Dad: ""I'd rather see you unhappy as an old maid than marry a non-Chinese."" -&gt; after finding out that I have a non-Chinese BF

* Dad (to a teacher - I found about this from the teacher): ""I know that my daughter would rather major in something related to the liberal arts or social sciences, but I'm sure that majoring in business is the better choice for her.""

* Despite knowing that I'd rather master in something else than get an MBA, my dad keeps telling me about MBA programs that have started taking in applicants. When he's in a bad mood, I sometimes even get yelled at for being unambitious, complacent, and the like.

* I got accepted into a masteral program that I'm actually interested in. Instead of congratulating me, my dad just said, ""Oh. I thought you were getting an MBA? You said you were getting an MBA."" This was despite my repeated emphasis on not being interested in an MBA. I guess it shows that he's not listening to me, and is still thinking that his desires = my desires.

* Mom: ""You should stop thinking of yourself and make us happy by breaking up with your BF.""

* Dad (again, on my BF): ""I bet that if we got sick because of stress, you still wouldn't break up with your BF and you wouldn't think that it's your fault, because your generation is so selfish like that.""

1371028140.0,42,self.AsianParentStories,1g6p9g,"Asian parents trying to retire/YOLO, forcing their BS onto me.",cowchee,54,12,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1g6p9g/asian_parents_trying_to_retireyolo_forcing_their/,"Just discovered this place and i'm unsure if it's to seek advice or just rant - read however you'd like.

My parents gave birth to 4 daughters - I am the 2nd oldest. The folks really wanted a boy but they are too old to try again. (dad wants to cheat/remarry but thats another story). The parents are completely uneducated, blue collar  immigrants - this is important (I think)

Next important fact: since my sister's and I don't have penises, my parents really don't care about us - us daughters should marry away and so they can finally retire. My older sister failed school, left while in college, while stealing thousands of dollars from them - but of those 3, the parents only care about the money.

Here's the last fact before I connect the dots: My older sister is never coming back because she can barely afford her new baby. Well, that means I'm the next eldest,  so somehow I have a DUTY to care for the parents and younger sisters. 

Combine the three above and what do you get? Parents who don't give a flying fuck because they're trying to retire, but still believe I owe them for everything they've done for me. So they don't want me, but require me to raise the youngest sister as my own child and then send them 1/3 of my paycheck to help them retire? That way they retire 10 years earlier and don't have to deal with their failed sperm gamble. I don't think this has anything to do with asian, mostly stupid mixed with asian thinking.

Now introduce the last stupid asian belief - Daddy is always right. I logically prove them how wrong and hypocritical they are (like forcing me to care for the youngest, but them refusing to care for my newborn niece my older sister can't afford - or dad caught cheating so somehow everyone else, including wife, is wrong?). Still, they'll just think I'm rude and block me out. Of course I object and talk back, but that means I have the worst attitude and get treated like the worst daughter in the world. Sorry but I'm not paying for my younger sister's (only 2 years younger) gas or cleaning her mess just because I'm older and she cuts herself. If I help my sister out, it's a FAVOR because I love her, not my DUTY. 

I'm the worst daughter in the world, but they have to leave their hopes of retirement with me - my younger sister is depressed (which she just needs to suck up - she cheats on her lesbian girlfriend and gets depressed when the one she cheated with turns around and cheats on her). My older sister can't get her shit together because she's an absolute princess with a baby. My youngest sister is they one they're desperately trying to get rid of to retire. 

So they're mad I'm such a shitty daughter because they think I cheating them out of their only hope of retirement. as a result, they treat me like shit everyday at home (just graduated but need to find job). My depressed emo sister gets a brand new lexus SUV, I get a shitty used corolla that breaks and EVERYONE borrows yet I pay gas for (And I can't demand for gas money back because daddy bought it for me). They demand I clean the entire house when everyone else is on vacation. And they pile their crap in my room because my parents are HOARDERS too. Yea and I don't get any money from them, but they give the depressed daughter their credit card all the time to waste cash. 

It's so bad I realized I've been selling all my possessions just so I can 100% claim I'm not doing my own chores. My sisters won't help - they acknowledge I'm not getting fair treatment, but want me to solve it myself. THey won't however acknowledge that I get blamed for their mistakes.  I'm paying and cleaning their crap half the time anyway so it's a pretty sweet deal for them. I'm the shitty, clumsy, daughter that gets blamed for everything. I'm a punching bag, a dumpster.

Except, unlke them,  I don't fuck up in school, get into too much debt, pick cheating partners, steal from parents, or spend thousands on a gucci bag. Actually, I have latin honors, a packed resume, a frugal lifestyle, and a boyfriend who actually helps me solve all their bullshit. But none of this makes sense to my parents or my older sister who aren't educated. My BF is bad because he forget to say Thank you to them, but they don't say it to him, or even feel thankful he does their chores - It's somehow HIS duty as well. And god forbid trying to explain why unpaid internships are necessary in this job market.

They don't realize I'm actually a great daughter who loves my family despite their flaws. WHAT THE FUCK! I'd prefer Tiger mom over this shit, because at least they want me to do well. My parents are just selfish. I feel bad for my youngest sister, who's going through the worst half-assed parenting out of the 4 sisters. I hope I actually make enough to take her in. She's the next punching bag after I leave because the one 2 years younger is depressed and gets babied.

For now, I've been labeling and selling all my possessions so I can force my sisters to clean their own shit. I'm distancing myself, avoiding dinner, etc. just so I dont have to get yelled at for something I didn't do. I'm going to stay at home and save money until the next time they threaten to kick me out. Hopefully by then I can afford moving out. I've realized despite giving my sisters so much to save them from trouble, I can't count on them to do the same for me.

I took these lessons to heart and worked my ass off throughout middle school and my first two years of high school - I was a straight A student and even managed to win a couple national awards at a business competition. At home, this was never met by any congratulations, but rather by an attitude that ""all of this was expected. No time to celebrate, get your head back in the books."" 

By the end of my sophomore year of high school, I was tired of the bullshit and decided to get out of my hovering mother and enrolled in a boarding school about two hours away. Unfortunately, with all of this freedom, I started messing around with drinking and weed and some of my grades slipped during my junior year. By this point, I dreaded the phone calls from home as they would always turn into hour long shout fests with my mother with her constantly reminding me of my inadequacy.

By the second semester, I decided that the only way to stop dealing with her BS would be to not give her any excuses to give me crap. I got my shit together academically and I scored pretty well in the SAT and ACTs. Cue senior year, college applications, etc. etc. I thought I did alright, but my courseload was pretty heavy and took some time out that I could have used for essays.

I felt like my entire life had been wasted. My mom came and sat down next to me (I thought at first to comfort me a little bit), but then turn to me and said, ""You failed. Now you have to pay your own way through your state school.""

At first, I was stunned by her callousness, but then I noticed the silver lining in this deal - FINALLY it would be me taking control of my own damn future instead of her behind me the whole way. I worked my ass off waiting tables over the last five months and today, I can proudly say that I have the whole first semester of school paid off. While I'm still a long ways away from completion, I now know for myself that I can do it without any help, pushing, or ridicule from the tiger parents. Stay strong guys. Independence feels great.

We were confused because who sends a gifts for high school graduation, but not college? My mom had two hypotheses: either my aunt forgot that I graduated from college (I hadn't even gone to the ceremony and made no big deal about it), or the gift got lost in the mail.

My mom never likes to be direct about anything, so my other aunt (aforementioned cousin's mom) decided to ask about it. The answer she got for me was: my oldest cousin graduated from college thirteen years ago, and apparently only one of his nine aunts and uncles had sent him a gift.

Despite all the success as being a ""model minority"" within the U.S., there are definitely glaring shortcomings for kids that grow up in an Asian household (insecurities, difficulty dynamics with adults, lack of hobbies, etc.). 

I've noticed some general trends of Asian parents are:

* Comparing the academic performance of own children versus the children of others
* A need to manage children's finances, housing, etc.
* Having racial preferences for in-laws
* Being frugal to the point of being cheap
* Threats about disowning children due to conflicts of interests (arising mainly from dating)
* Heavy emphasis on academic performance
* Paranoid thoughts that the world is out to get them*
* Personification of inanimate objects/displacing blame (bumping into a doorframe and saying ""stupid house"")*
* Extreme sacrifice (saving the best meat for children to eat)
* Rejection of scientific thought in favor of superstition and sensationalist journalism*
* No vocalization of love
* Short tempers

The list goes on. 

Are Asian parenting styles and traits primarily the result of Confucian philosophy combined with a collectivist mindset? How did these behaviors manifest? Why the boundary between Asian parenting and Narcissistic Personality Disorder so unclear?

I'm hoping I can get more relevant responses here.  (mods, let me know if this type of post is okay) 

**tl;dr at the bottom**



I'm a confused Korean boy (24), and my darling girlfriend is Chinese (22) (I apologize in advance if this gets overly saccharine). We've been dating for 4 months and are in the middle of 2 months of long distance so far. I'm in love with her and I really want to make our relationship work. I think it's a little early to seriously start thinking about big questions like marriage but we both think we may have found the one. We have discussed the future to some extent so we can make responsible judgments about our rship. I have high hopes for us, seeing how well we get along (like best friends!) and support each other. We've only had two or three fights this entire time, but we're able to quickly see around the bad feelings and resolve the issue. She somehow looks past all my faults and weirdness and loves me for who I am. We can talk for hours about all sorts of things and share similar interests. We have to make it through 5 years of long distance, but we've been talking every day and doing amazing for these first few months. We'll have to see how the next few years go, but I think we can make it especially if we visit each other frequently.



And now the catch. My parents, having certain conservative Korean values (they immigrated here a few years before I was born), strongly prefer a Korean daughter. Maybe the term racist was a little strong, or maybe it's not strong enough, but you can be the judge of that. When I revealed to them I am dating my gf they flatly said no since she's Chinese. Since then we've been discussing it, sometimes calmly, sometimes quite heatedly. They still refuse to meet her or judge her on her personal qualities. They say they believe me that she's a great girl, but claim the race issue is insurmountable. We've been arguing off and on for 2 months now and I've been becoming angrier the longer they insult my gf like this and the more I realize how prejudiced they are.

Let me tell you a little about my parents so you know what kind of situation I'm in. Both my parents do care for me and we've gotten along reasonably well up till around college. My mom is pretty reasonable and understanding so I get along with her pretty well. On the other hand, even though he tries to be a good parent, my dad is stubborn and has anger management issues. Normally, in a Korean family this isn't a ""problem"" b/c the children are supposed to obey their father even into adulthood. When I was young I always respected what he said, but after going to college I've learned to think for myself more and we don't get along like we used to. Around the time I graduated from college I started to strive for more independence, b/c that's how we do things in the USA. Even so, we haven't had a big dividing issue until now. We've always reasoned things out or I, performing decently academically, haven't disappointed their Asian expectations. (btw, let's not get into stereotypes here, I'm just one data point so I'm not going to waste time trying to be perfectly PC when talking about my family) So now you know what it looks like to my parents if I suddenly vehemently oppose their wishes for the first time in my life.

I was actually surprised how much my parents opposed my rship when I told them. I'd always known them as nice people, but I guess their Korean bias is one thing they can't get around. They are so engrossed in their old way of thinking that they even have evidence to support why interracial marriage is bad, and they think (or claim) they are doing a good thing for me by opposing this. (a very few reasons are legit, like interracial children having identity issues, but good parenting can solve that, and if we're too scared to fight for interracial rights, what's gonna become of America.. ok i shouldn't make this political) Over the last month I built up courage to stand my ground and do something drastic if necessary. No way I'm going to break up due to my parents' narrowmindedness. I'll just have to show them they're misguided.



And now catch number two. Recently I learned that my father had surgery for colon cancer and has a 10-15% chance of relapse. No, he's not lying. It slipped out during an argument, and he's been hiding it to keep me from worrying. Before I started dating my gf, my mom told me my dad has some health issues so I've known about this, but my dad is an introvert and lied about its seriousness till now. My mom confirmed to me privately that my dad is indeed fighting to prevent a cancer relapse, and she is not the type to play dirty and lie no matter how much she wants me to break up. I lost some motivation after learning this. It was pretty tough suddenly learning about the cancer, especially since it had been hidden from me. It's difficult for me to push myself to play brinkmanship with my parents now, and I feel limited to convincing them patiently, which may or may not work. I want to stick it out, show my dad that I care for his health, while still convincing them to accept my gf. However, I'm afraid my resolve may falter given my dad's health condition if he tries to do something like disown me (he threatened to do something bad if I don't end my rship within half a year or so). The last thing I want to do is drag my gf along saying things are ok, and then run into a famiy crisis later and end up hurting her.



And now I should tell you a little about my gf's parents. Her dad has an unfavorable view of Koreans as sweettalking womanizers, so she had to work hard to convince him that my American roots makes me different. Her parents were finally coming around to accepting me when they visited her (when we weren't doing long distance yet), but certain events made them have a bad impression of me and we had to start back from square one. She persuaded him again to let us be, and I eventually got on skyping terms with her dad and tried to show him i'm sincere. However, he kept warning her that I may succumb to my parents' Korean pressure, and whenever he heard things weren't going well on my side, he'd get angry that my parents were insulting his daughter. 

When I told my gf I'm worried my resolve is faltering, we considered breaking up. Her father learned of this and became quite angry (partially at me for losing a little of my resolve, quite understandably) and she had to deal with the fallout. Her parents now probably think we have broken up. She and I ourselves are somewhat unsure where we stand. But we're still sure we love each other. And we still want to work for a future together.

Now there's more pressure on my girlfriend, because if she sticks this out waiting for me to convince my parents, on top of having to trust that I'll pull through, she has to keep her own dad at bay by lying to him or otherwise convincing him to give me another chance. As for me, I need to find a way to convince my parents diplomatically, or if need be, play brinkmanship without feeling guilty about my dad's health. My gf and I have dealt with a lot of shit these 4 months (ok it's not a lot compared to some others out there), but we've also had some amazing experiences, still love each other, and have matured pretty quickly together. If anyone has any input please help!

If someone actually sees this and replies, I anticipate that some people may say I lack balls. I realize I may be looking at the situation (especially my dad's health) pessimistically... if so, please help me see around that. Also, please focus on the parent issues. Although the long distance part may seem daunting, my gf and I are fairly confident we can pull through. I included that info primarily for context. Thanks for reading this rather long post!



**tl;dr** - I'm Korean, gf is Chinese. Dating 4 months, started long distance 2 months ago. Have ~5 years of long distance left, but we're becoming closer and more serious. My parents refuse to accept or meet non-Korean girlfriends, and threaten they may take extreme measures. They're normally nice parents, but they can't see past their own prejudice. gf's parents are somewhat accepting of me but constantly pressure/warn her about my parents. My dad recently had surgery for colon cancer with 10-15% chance of relapse, and I lost some resolve. We considered breaking up, but we still love each other and are still sticking together. Trying to figure out where to go from here, and how to challenge my parents without feeling guilty about my dad's health.

I've met some amazing people there who have completely changed my outlook on life. My first year of university was the happiest year of my life because I finally had friends and people I was incredibly close to.

I was also the last person to see him before he died. I've been trying to deal with the survivor's guilt ever since. With the help of my friends I've been coping really well. I still studied and did get an upper second class on two out of my three exams (I go to school in the UK and the grading system is 1st, upper second, lower second, third). However one exam was on my deceased friends birthday. I couldn't stop thinking about him and how guilty I felt and fell to pieces during the exam. I failed that third one and my parents have decided to respond by taking away my social life. I was planning on sharing a house with two of my closest friends but my parents are now insisting I live alone because they are convinced the fact that I had a social life is the reason I failed that exam. They don't understand that without my friends I most likely would have failed all three exams because I wouldn't have been able to cope with the guilt.

Figure you guys would want to hear this funny story.

My mum was a single mum and has busted her ass to put me through private school. As a result I started working early and bought a house for us to live in. In return for paying the bills she cooks, cleans and nags. Bless her soul.

She once every while does a spot clean of my room. She's found some sleeping pills and bongs a few times, but she no longer goes bat shit crazy. Lets say I've desensitised her through attrition. As a result she's not really on my back and I tend to joke and laugh with her.

However the other day it seems the line was crossed. In a haste to leave, I left a bag of sex toys I keep (for lady friends which stay over now and then) lying around. I'm not talking about just a dildo. There were whips, candles.... There's worse but ill leave it there.

I get home and notice it's gone. I was flushed with indignation and embarrassment, with a spark of anger to turn it into rage. I confront her in the kitchen - frankly I was yelling, which I now regret - but she was giving it right back. In broken English she said, ""this is so evil! Not good. Why you do this? What did I do wrong?"".

I basically left home, forget where. Came back later, much calmer. I apologise and we have a calm discussion, I ask for the toys back. She says only under the condition I never use them. I lie through my teeth and say yes. 

And we now pretend like it never happened. Any similar stories?

My parents kept me strictly in a bubble until I left for undergraduate studies, but there I learned to fend for myself. I found myself hanging out with a lot of Indian students, and couldn't really get along with too many Indian Americans.

I found I relate better to international students than I do with American students, whether they're Caucasian or not (though I have Caucasian friends too). A lot of my high school friends described me as ""half-Indian and half-American"" and a more recent friend told me he thought I had spent part of my life in India and part of my life here.

Let me give several examples:

* In early *elementary* school, they would tell me crap like: ""Oh, don't marry a black girl. Don't marry a Hispanic girl. Don't marry an Indian girl. Or any of the dirty Asian races. Don't be gay. I'll disown you if you do any of these.""

* Also since early elementary school, my mother has always asked me, ""When you're grown up and both me and your wife are in a life/death situation, who would you save?"" She still asks me this question.

* I'm 18 fucking years old, and when I tell my mom, ""Hey I'm gonna go to a friend's house,"" she'll act like she's giving me permission, as if I was asking for permission in the first place. How about, ""Mom, I'm a legal adult. I graduated high school. Even if you didn't give me 'permission', I'd go anyway. I'm just telling you where I'm gonna be."" But if I told her something like that, she'd just patronize me somehow.

* Every since I was little, my parents have always been [pretty stereotypically] making me say I'll be a doctor when I grow up (my parents aren't doctors). And I do--but because I spent a lot of time with my grandparents (both doctors) and I've legitimately developed an interest. But I feel like they think I'm doing this for them. Like I'm their little puppet.

* They're really, and I mean REALLY negative about everything and everyone. Whenever they meet *any* friends of mine, later they'll say, ""She was ugly. He was really short. That guy had the stupidest looking haircut ever. That girl was really stupid."" Or, ""This friend of yours got into this college, why didn't you? That friend of yours won a scholarship, why didn't you? That kid can do that, why can't you?""

* When I tell either parent they're being overbearing, they'll always say, ""Overbearing? I'm not overbearing. What about (some kid they remember from elementary school)? That kid's parents are overbearing."" They're always talking about the weird kid from my high school who had no friends.

* My parents telling me throughout high school that ""I can't have a girlfriend."" Excuse me? Like I need your permission for that? As a result, I've never brought a girl to my house. Now I think my parents think I'm gay.

* My parents trivialize every difficulty I've had with school. ""Oh, B in English? Are you stupid? All you have to do is read a book."" ""Oh, B in History? Are you stupid? All you have to do is read a book."" You get that idea.

One event that hits me hard was when my sister left to hang out with friends who were in town and were staying at a hotel. They were gonna go to a theme park and then chill later. A few hours into her leaving, my dad goes into complete panic/rage mode when she didn't pick up her phone. He called the amusement park, hotel, the police, our cell phone carrier to try and bring his 21 year old daughter home. Why? Because she hasn't updated him within the last 30 minutes. Turns out she was at the hotel pool with her friends. They brought her back home, and my dad verbally abused my sister in front of her friends while they all had to stand there and take it. He even scolded her friends.

Now that I'm in my 20s, my parents acknowledge that people do date but they keep telling me not to date now. They want me to date when in my late 20s.

I love my parents, but the absurdity of that conversation was great. I didn't even bother mentioning it to my dad.

It's been like this for years, but one thing that stands out and annoys me the most is my dad's desires to make us kids ""hail corporate"" and become workaholics at a young age. He works at a decent corporate level at a very large multinational company and for years, he's been pushing me and my siblings to read up on articles, meeting and staff training material, and a whole bunch of other corporate training stuff he gets from work.

We (me and my siblings and mom) think it's all a waste of time and utter bullshit. Just about every article, booklet and PDF keeps regurgitating one another and constantly paraphrases a single point for pages and pages. Basically, I've concluded that all this material can be summarized as ""be a nice, hardworking, docile employee who takes anything from the company and does it, including getting screwed up your ass by corporate"".

We're sick of all this and each time, he expects us to read them and give him summaries and/or answer quiz questions from him, otherwise he'll give us a huge scold-down.

I don't need to read the shit you give me because they are mostly corporate propaganda with ZERO educational value and I'm pretty sure the company(s) that hire me in the future will give me appropriate training for the job.

Oh my dad also thinks that staying long hours till 7 or 8pm (without overtime pay), going out of your way to do free shit or errands for the company (which the company may or may not care/appreciate, usually the latter) and constantly obsessing over work and improving the business (eventhough he's just a fucking employee-drone for the company; he isn't anywhere near CEO or stakeholder) are WONDERFUL habits to have.

Anyway, since we've had a lot of replies of the form that involve parents having misunderstandings with our parents as teenagers, how about some stories about misunderstandings we've had with our parents once we left the nest (or at least partially did)? I'll start off...

(Note that this is a repost from another thread, but expanded upon.)

Since my Junior year of college, until now (I'm 22 at the time of this writing), my parents have been calling me twice a day. I've, by and large, kept this practice up, with little exception. I remember when I was working on my senior design project, I was stuck in a computer lab without cell phone reception (or windows, but I wasn't a grad student yet though so I didn't appreciate them enough), where I was working 14-16 hours a day. Because of that I'd only occasionally receive my parents' phone calls (generally when I forced myself to occasionally go outside), so I'd only talk to them once a day every other day. In the beginning they were okay with it, but as I progressively ignored their calls and refused to be apologetic about it, I could feel that their regard for what I was doing was steadily going downhill. When I did talk, I didn't expend effort to respond enthusiastically or follow any conversation that my parents wanted to start on the phone, because I was just dead from day after punishing day of work. If I had any free time, I just wanted to sink into a chair or a bed and sleep.

After this kept up for about a week, my parents went hysterical. They accused me of leaving school and having fun on some road trip. I was off having fun somewhere, tanking my grades, and too scared to hold a proper conversation with them and ""man up"" about what I was doing. What was sad was I was just tired and frustrated from putting in countless hours of work into a project that, at the time, just wasn't getting done. To say that I was mad was an understatement. Rather than offering me support and understanding for the toll that my work was taking on me, they turned around to accuse me of *not doing work*, and just made my situation that much more distasteful. It was definitely a low point for the project.

Of course a week later the project concluded, our team won awards (and $$$ !), and over the course of weeks I showed my parents our awards and our team's output to convince them that we had, indeed, been working on a project. Now I just sit back and laugh about this story over a few drinks with friends.

I'm no longer a minor.,floatinglotus,35,5,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1hcjdo/my_parents_are_insisting_on_managing_my_finances/,"With so many stories to share about my parents, I feel that they'd end up as Hall of Famers in this subreddit. Honestly, I wanted this to be a throwaway account at first, but this thread has proven to be a therapeutic outlet for me. And now I have yet another problem about them; I need some advice.

Despite having a stable, relatively good-paying job, my parents still refuse to acknowledge my independence and adulthood, as I've stated in multiple stories. They still act extremely overprotective (I'm not being redundant - I added ""extremely"" for emphasis), e.g. they refuse to let me move out (and I fear they'll blame and harass my friends and BF if I do, especially since it's not the norm here in Southeast Asia for unmarried people to move out). They also micromanage a lot - my mom, for one, thinks that she can still have a say in what I should and shouldn't wear.

Anyway, my problem this time is that they want to handle my finances for me. Right now, my earnings from work are in an ATM account (so I can withdraw funds easily when I need them), a mutual fund, a savings account, and an insurance premium. I want to handle my finances myself, because, for me, this is a step towards independence.

For the longest time, my parents have been insisting that they manage my funds for me. However, before, I'd usually just change the topic and mention vaguely that I have ""investments."" This time, though, I don't know what started it, but my parents started getting insistent again. Here's where it gets crazier.

**My mom doesn't want me bringing my ATM card when I go out.** She thinks that just by using my ATM card, I'm making my money vulnerable to thieves, such as the ones who swipe information from your card via certain devices. (Though, the weird thing is, as far as they know, I've never used my ATM. It's really weird that they think that way.)

Mind you, my mom is an extreme technophobe. She seems highly resistant to modern technology, e.g. she just learned to use a mobile phone out of necessity. She doesn't even have a credit card because she's afraid that one day, it might get stolen. She hasn't ever used an ATM in her life, either, so she doesn't know how it works, even though I've said that using one is that simple. (To add, I don't know why she's like this, when she isn't even a first-gen immigrant. She's second-gen, but maybe they didn't use ATMs prevalently before?) She pretty much just read some stories of people losing their money to thieves and syndicates, and now she thinks I shouldn't bring my ATM out (especially since she thinks I don't use it anyway), lest I get robbed one day. Funny thing is, on normal days, I usually just go to work (via car) and then go home, so there's hardly any chance I'll get robbed.

**As for my dad, he wants to handle my investments for me.** I finally had to tell him specifically about my investments, but he's still insisting on seeing my statements of account. Again, thinking that he's the sole, best authority on what to do, he told me that I better not have invested in a high-risk MF (i.e. a pure equity fund). The thing is, I have invested in two MFs - one is purely an equity fund, and the other is a balanced fund. I explained to him how an MF works, and that how it's best treated as a long-term investment, because if you treat it as something short-term, the fluctuations in the stock market will have more impact on your investment. But he got mad when I explained it to him, saying that he knows what an MF is - better than I do, even. I may not claim to know much about an MF, but I know the basics. Yet my dad initially said that MFs are insurance (when not all of them are), and - in yet another example of my dad being contradictory - he said in one sentence that an MF is a good investment, and then in another that MFs are a load of BS, and that fund managers are just embezzling money. (He doesn't seem to get the concept of management fees.) I don't know what he might do if he finds out just what kind of MFs I invested in.

**Basically, I just want to manage my finances on my own, but they don't seem to want that to happen.** I really want to be financially independent, and here's why: when I was a minor, I trusted my parents to handle all my savings. Whatever I saved from my allowance, or any prize money I got, I'd give to them because they're the ones who opened a savings account for me. They told me to just leave it to them and I, being a lot more unassuming back then, just trusted them to handle my savings. I have never seen or touched that account. But now that I'm all grown up and am ""disobedient"" in their eyes (for various reasons - see my previous stories), there's a chance I might never get the money in that account. I don't want to assume the worst about my parents, but at the same time, I know what they're capable of. At worst, there's always a chance they could use that as leverage against me, to keep me in line. And I don't want to do things such as break up with my BF or get an MBA I don't want just to be able to touch that savings account in the future. So these earnings I've gotten from work are, I suppose, my real savings, since this is money I can actually touch.

**To add: also, something I find rather fishy - every time my parents bring this up, one of the first things they always say is, ""It's not that we're going to take your money; we're just guiding you.""** But their definition of guidance is more like actually doing things for me and micromanaging my affairs.

Actually, at first, I never even thought that they're going to take my money or anything, but isn't it rather suspicious that they always defensively bring that up, even before I noticed it? It feels to me that they're scared that I'm being financially independent. Again, I feel a little bad for assuming the worst about my parents, but knowing how much of a control freak my dad is, it feels like they want to handle my finances not because they don't have enough money, but rather, they want to keep me in line.

And when I say that I'll handle it myself, they treat it like it's a bad thing, like I'm being selfish. My dad even got pissed that I didn't consult him for guidance first (in general, he's been pissed at me lately because I didn't consult him for guidance about stuff like choosing where I want to work, what I want to do, who to vote for - I kid you not!, etc.).

As usual, my parents are holding on to their outdated views in life. They don't have much of an idea of how the world actually works; they only hold on to what they know. For instance, in a facepalm-worthy moment, my mom only recently found out that not everyone who applies to my company gets hired. And if ever they pick up something new, all they pick up and remember is scaremongering (whether real or sensationalistic), which is why they often say that the new generations are bad/wrong/immoral/whatever, the state of affairs these days is crappy compared to before, etc. Bring up something positive and it's usually quickly forgotten (e.g. tell them that you can make money through the Internet, e.g. through e-commerce, but they'll still say that the Internet is useless.) But then they always insist that they know more, simply because they're older. By being older, they think they're already more experienced, which I highly doubt, because they're antisocial, and the few people they get along with are people who validate their beliefs.

Sometimes, I feel that there's just no winning with people like these. Got any advice?

**UPDATE:** (reposting my comment) **And the shitstorm continues.** My parents just started yelling at me again. I'm really at my wits' end with these people. There really is no reasoning with them because they pretty much believe that they know a lot and have a lot of experience simply by virtue of them being older and thus having lived longer. Every retort you make, however sensible, is always met with insane troll logic or emotional responses.

My mom doesn't even know what a mutual fund is, but then she started yelling at me and calling me a dumbass for investing my money for nothing. (Proof she doesn't know what it is: she then asked my dad in the next breath what an MF was; it was almost funny.) And my dad accused me of creating a joint account with my BF. All this because I didn't want to show them my statements of account because I want to handle my finances myself. Whereas other families would have praised me for handling my money by myself, this is what I get from my folks.

Moreover, they keep thinking that fund managers will embezzle my money because of whatever so-and-so said or whatever they read in the papers. They also said that the problem with me is that I think I know so much when they know better than I do. Uh-huh. Their last few retorts were the usual passive-aggressive shit, e.g. ""Oh well; that's your money anyway, you can get duped all you want,"" ""We never said we're gonna steal her money but that's what she's thinking!,"" and ""Well, I guess she doesn't need our guidance anymore.""

BTW, I told the folks that I doubt they truly understand what my investments are, and they pretty much said that they know better than I do because they're older, and because they read about so-and-so (which is pretty much a litany of negative things they heard about the financial world, never mind whether or not actually understood what they read).

**Further edited to add:** I am about to sleep, yet my mom still cannot stop putting words in my mouth and accusing me of thinking that they'll steal my money, and that I don't trust them. Ironic how they also don't trust me in that they're accusing me of creating a joint account. She also cannot stop saying that no parent wants to do his/her kid harm, and is alternating between yelling at me for not being independent (apparently, unlike people back then) and demanding why I won't show my investments so that they can see if what I did was ""correct"" or ""wrong."" The scariest part is that she's telling me about her friend, who's so proud of her (the friend's) kids because the kids give their entire salary to her, depending on her to give them an allowance **from their own earnings.** Like I said, the few friends my folks have are people who validate their beliefs.",,False,self,t5_2u8j6,1372955888.0,,,True,t3_1hcjdo,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1hcjdo/my_parents_are_insisting_on_managing_my_finances/,

I have spoken to some overseas-born Chinese and their families seem to be crushing them.  The mother often overbearing, the father often non-existent.  I have seen this result in Chinese people being either very quiet and withdrawn or going into some hedonistic hellride.

* Escalate hard and fast (lol) if a teacher screws you over. This will make things easier if you get a crappy grade. Do not wait hoping things will resolve themselves. 

* Study groups. These teach you how normal people function, plus they can be passed off as school related. 

* Politely ask family friends to NEVER mention anything about you to your parents. Even compliments will be misunderstood and turned into criticism of you. Doubly bad because people outside the family are mentioning how crappy you are. 

* Never ever give out your phone number. You have no clue what your parents might say to who calls. Plus, you will be criticized about the people who do call, based on the short time your parents talk to these people. 

* The only two hobbies you will admit to having: [classical instrument], school. 

* Important extension to the above rule: those are the only two things you even LIKE.

America is more racially diverse from the countries her parents and my parents came from, respectively, but consequently, we ended up being the odd girls out when we attended school. Whereas, had our parents never moved, we'd be another face in the crowd. Back to the point, in addition to surviving awkward adolescence hell, we were bombarded by All-American media (movies/shows of preteens/tweens/teens with love interests, teen magazines with cover girls, and blonde pop stars galore) all of which reminded us of how additionally different we were. Personally, my self esteem was pretty low because I felt somewhat like an outsider and it didn't help that boys weren't really interested. At school, on TV, gazing at the magazine racks in the checkout line, everything reminded me that I didn't have huge, bright eyes; strong feminine facial features; a waif body frame, etc. All the straight-As in the world couldn't give me the attention (we're talking attention, period. not even ""hey i have a crush on you"" attention) cheerleaders, popular girls, or even normal girls would get from people who wanted to befriend them or date them. My parents thought my life was great because Perfect Attendance, Distinguished Student, etc. certificates were rolling in. But life was bland. I didn't have lively hallway chats, desk swarmings of gossip buzzing, balloons and bears from dudes asking me if I wanted to go to prom/formal. I didn't go on a date, didn't go to a party. And none of it was because I didn't want to. I always thought I was left out because I was different. Whether it's true or not is debatable I suppose but in attempts to raise my social stock, I learned to do makeup damn well. My parents thought it was tacky, that I looked the same with our without, and would suggest not to wear any, it's a waste of time, etc. 'Til this day they feel that way. When I tell them that my life probably would've played out differently if I didn't look so ethnic on top of the awkward teen phase, they don't believe me. They said people probably didn't think so little of me (like my assumption) because I did so well academically but my grades didn't win me no (sic) friends or boyfriends.

For those of you who commented on it, I thank you very much for your responses. I'm sorry I haven't really replied to some. I've been offline for quite a while. 

So, I finally ""stood up for myself"" today and told my dad that the Family Educational Rights Acts (FERPA) does not grant him the *right* to my password. The conversation went something like this: 

*on the phone*

Me: Dad, can I use the car?

Dad: Sure. Go show your mom the Spring Break schedule. I can't log into your account—you keep changing the password. 

Me: I did. You don't have to have my password; the calendar is public. 

Dad: What's your password? 

Me: You don't need my password. FERPA only says that I give you permission to request to the university and see my grades...or you can ask me to see it. 

Dad: *getting irritated* oh, is that—no, I signed the paper (he really didn't; I did...when I was in high school...when I didn't know what was yellow and what was red). You have to give me your password. 

Me: No, I don't have to; it says you can request my grades but nothing about you having my password. 

*I know this because I work at an office at the university*

Dad: Well, if you think that way, don't think you can have my passwords. Don't ask for my passwords. 

*What password do I need of him? I don't use his anything. I'll be fine, I thought* 

Okay. I said no change in tone. 

He hung up and called back to the house, my mom answered. 

Dad: Take the car, just take the car to work. Don't let *throwinginthedeep* use it. Don't let her use it. 

What a hypocrite, I said to my mom. 

---

I went about my day as usual: class and work. Then dinner with clients/students from work. 

I had invited my dad along to the dinner on the previous night. I called many times--the house, his cell--he didn't answer. Okay. 

I'm getting drunk with my coworker then. 

I got home, my dad was already asleep. I'm now lying on the floor in my room typing this up. 

Before I am where I am now, I tried to log into my desktop and was prompted to log on to a network at which point I realise that my dad has changed our network Wi-Fi. Firstworldproblem I guess. But, I need wifi to do crap. 

Aside from him violating federal law, it's irritating. He claims that he needs it to just keep up with my grades but I call on that bullshit. He goes through my school email that's linked with the account, reads the chats with my classmates, reads the attachments on the email (he asked me if I wrote a letter to the city, even though the only place that would have been available was in attached an email I sent to my professor) and opens my Google Drive files.

Well, I brought him over to meet my mom and she was fine with it, but she didn't really engage him in conversation or anything to try to get to know him; it was fairly awkward. 

Anyway, fast forward a few months later... Every single time I've left the house, she IMMEDIATELY thinks I'm going to hang out with my boyfriend and will say passive aggressive things like, ""Oh, you think your boyfriend is more important than your family? Okay, fine, go move in with him then!"" or ""I hope he can take care of you when you get pregnant!"". What...? I know they might be empty threats, but it's so annoying and I don't know what to do about it. I really want everyone to be on friendly terms, but that just seems impossible with my mom. 

She is suuuuper nice to my cousin's boyfriend (probably because he's a fellow Asian...) even though she is younger than me. Apparently everyone is allowed to have a boyfriend except for me. 

TL;DR - I'm 24 but not allowed to date unless I want to be kicked out of the house because apparently just being around guys will get me pregnant.

Edit: It's also weird that she will let me go out to the bars, get super wasted and come home the next day hungover, but if I EVER mentioned anything about a guy, it's a deal breaker.

I'm starting to feel indecisive.",sunnily,28,3,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1jmssq/im_secretly_preparing_to_move_out_of_my_parents/,"My parents and I did not have a good relationship when I was growing up. I was a pretty good kid in high school who studied hard, never partied, obedient and was in a bunch of extracurriculars, but they always screamed at me about how stupid and useless I was and beat me for trivial things. I remember being savagely beaten with a baseball bat, punched repeatedly in the face, choked, and kicked while I was curled up on the ground for being shy and thus embarrassing them. However, when I went away to college, our relationship got better.

In college, although my parents pushed me to be premed, I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I tried a bunch of different jobs and internships and did not commit to the premed track. I ended up graduating early and decided to continue working at the job I held while in my last semester to figure out my career aspirations. To my dismay, I eventually realized that I wanted to go into medicine, so I made plans to work part-time and take the pre-requisites one by one. My parents, however, encouraged me to come home again, telling me that they missed me, that in Korea, kids live at home until they are married, and that they needed my help at their business. I believed them and made the stupidest, most regretful decision of my life and moved home.

Immediately, my parents started screaming at me and hitting me again. Now that I was financially dependent on them, their favorite threat was kicking me out and telling me good luck with being homeless and without a job. I had already spent my meager savings on tuition and had a significant amount of student loans, so I didn't want to take on more to move out, so I just applied desperately to any job available. I eventually and thankfully got a low-paying, part-time, entry level medical job and things got better, but now my parents are giving me an ultimatum to quit my job and focus on the MCAT in August or kicking me out immediately. I felt trapped, depressed and suicidal.

I would love to study full-time for the MCAT, however I will not make the same mistake again. I could keep my job and take the MCAT in January instead and still apply early, but my parents refuse to compromise. I feel like my parents want me to be in a vulnerable position, because it is easier to control me. As a result, starting next week I am working full-time and am looking for housing with my friend. 

I no longer feel suicidal, but I've been emotionally distraught. Fearing further violence and being homeless, I've been lying to my parents that I will quit my job, but as a normally honest and sincere person, the guilt is eating away at me. After I started lying, my mom has started being nice to me again (the abuse/nice treatment is cyclical), and it kills me to think of hurting her feelings and disappointing her even if I apply to med school a few years down the line, because her dream is for me to marry a doctor pff and I'll be too old then. Now that she's being relatively nice again, I'm starting to feel crazy, that my perception of reality is warped, that I'm overreacting, that they aren't abusive like they keep telling me and that the problem is me. If I were a better ""child,"" I would be treated better, that they will keep being nice. These thoughts and emotions keep battering away at me and my fears of ending up homeless are almost making me change my mind. It makes me anxious that in my budget estimations, I will only have approximately $250 left over per month to put into savings. But, I keep reminding myself that this ""nice"" period never lasts and all it takes is setting the table ""wrong"" or not cleaning something adequately enough to trigger the abuse again. I'm just so scared.

Me: ""But mom! Nobody wants to hire a 15-year-old who's going to quit in two months!""

Mom: ""You can babysit somebody.""

*Yeah, I've tried babysitting before. However when they're family, they never pay you because they think you're just doing it as a favor for them.*

I then noticed that whenever I thought of a job, my mom will give me some BS reason why it's a bad job. For example, I liked playing video games, so I figured I'd find work in a video game retail store.

Mom: ""You can't work there.""

Me: ""Why not? I have all the qualifications.""

Mom: ""Only boys work in video game stores. You are not a boy.""

*Never mind the fact that the store manager was a woman.*

Now, (if you've kept up with my posts here) I've graduated from college. Suddenly, my current retail job is not good enough and I must immediately begin searching for a new job, according to mom.

*Jeez, I've been working my butt off for years to get this college degree while having a job as well. Yes, I don't get many hours, but for once it feels good to have some free time, can I enjoy it for a bit?*

So the other day I saw a job posting at a travel agency. Sure, those are probably going out of business because of Internet options, but it seemed to correspond with my major. I went home to tell my mom I might have found something. Does she congratulate me? No, she says:

Mom: ""You can't work there.""

Me: ""And why not? I knew people in my field at school who worked at travel agencies.""

Mom: ""Those people have travelled all over the world. You have been nowhere. They won't want you.""

*How do you know? Did you ask them already what the qualifications were?*

I figured it couldn't hurt to ask, so I went back to the place anyway. Lo and behold, they didn't mention that one had to be a frequent traveler to work at a travel agency. They didn't even say anything about needing a college degree!

I'm going to at least apply for the job. I don't expect to get it, but in the event that I do, you guys can bet I will be laughing at my mom for a while.

Luckily, my life does not seem anywhere as tough as some of the stories I’ve heard on here. My mom’s side along with my dad (his family stayed in China) fled to America pretty early, around their early 20s. My mom is the youngest out of her siblings so you could say our family is more open-minded than the rest. Relatively speaking. For example, I have never had a curfew. I could hang out with whoever I wanted, as long as I never dated Black or Hispanic girls, which I’m not going to obey if I do happen to meet someone of that race that is compatible. Grades were important but I never got my ass beat for getting some B’s now and then. 

I started school in Chinatown and was deeply ingrained in the typical Asian culture. Fortunately for me, I was naturally good at academics in elementary school, definitely not the case now in college lol. I enjoyed reading, played the piano, even picked up the violin. 

But, I was removed from this culturally sheltered life when I got accepted at the age of 10 into one of those academic program for “gifted” minorities. Now like most Asian parents, every other minority (not white people though) was inferior. In Cantonese, the word “monster” is attached to each race. So for example, “Black monster” or “Hispanic monster.” This program was like 30% Asian, with the rest being Black or Hispanic. Now I still hung out with other Asian kids but I was exposed to a completely different culture. I was no longer trapped in this exclusive mindset of Asians’ being superior. After that, I was placed into an independent school where the population was about 90% upper class whites. The school designated itself as “progressive” and was a very liberal school. That’s when I started having troubles at home.

Originally, I was like most other Asian kids who obeyed their parents without question, disregarding the logic, or lack thereof, behind the commands. Now having experienced two mind-opening environments, I started to see the ridiculousness of some of the things my parents said, most notably the manipulative passive aggressive statements my mom made that really just pisses me off. She is never wrong and when she realizes she is, she throws a huge tantrum. Lose lose for whoever opposes her. When I question my parents, they usually responded with “because.”

“What do you mean because?!”

“*Scoffs* What do you mean what do I mean because?”
And so on.

I could go on for days about the problems I encountered, mostly due to communication issues and a quick temper, but I eventually just zoned them out when we had such problems. The problems all culminated one day when I realized my mom had put all my birthday, Christmas, Chinese New Year, etc. money in her own bank account for safekeeping. 

I got extremely pissed off and came to really hate this “bullshit communist” attitude, as I called it, where everyone was expected to share everything. I opened my own bank account and credit card the first chance I got and just saved up from my internships and jobs. The main takeaway here is how financial independence allowed for me to separate from my parents’ overbearing control. It shows that you're an adult and that you control your path, whether they like it or not. I haven’t had to ask them for money in years and I never to plan to ever again. I see stories of people sharing housing payments with their parents and I will never do that in a billion years.

My relationship with my parents has gotten better as this financial dependence connection between us  has been severed. I’ve learned to control my temper and realize that saying nothing is usually better than arguing. I’ve learned to not bring up my somewhat liberal views in front of my parents and if I do, it’s in a reasonable way. All this being said, I’m very lucky to have such accepting (again, relatively) parents, despite my mom’s manipulative tendencies. I’ve had a pretty privileged life and I understand they love me. It’s just their methods can be very irritating sometimes. 

Sorry for the rant. Just discovered this subreddit.

TL;DR: I’ve had it pretty good with my parents. Financial independence was a huge turning point for me. Sometimes, it’s better to just be quiet than try to reason with them.

I've been in a relationship with a Filipino for 4 years. Originally, we had an ""underground"" relationship, but we wanted to work up the courage to break it to them someday. I was supposed to start by introducing him as a friend, but thanks to some snooping, they found out about us prematurely.

The parents were never happy to begin with, but just recently, they have been getting more aggressive in trying to break us up, using coercion, intimidation and even threats like disowning me. They've been playing up all sorts of cards such as:

- ""Oh, so you're going to leave everyone who's loved and taken care of you for a man you've only known for a few years?""

- ""What if one of us gets sick and dies because of your own selfishness? Because you've been influenced by liberals, we're sure you'll say it's not your fault.""

- ""What about your siblings; who will take care of them if you leave?"" (I'm the oldest in my family and I have a few siblings who are still pretty young)

- ""Had I known you'd grow up to be such a frustration, if only you were never born!"" (I'm an achiever; I got good grades in school and am doing well in my job, but they're too fixated on the fact that I'm in a relationship with a Filipino to even consider that I haven't brought them shame for the first part.)

- ""Did you ever think of the shame you'll bring us if other Chinese people find out? Chinese society will never be ready for interracial relationships. Maybe someone else can pave the way, but that's not your problem. Don't be the one to do that."" (Not true; there are some Chinese families that are cool with interracial relationships. It's just that, unfortunately, my parents hang around with people that validate their beliefs... people that, I'm sure, would shame me if they ever found out.)

- ""How do you know he loves you?""

The entire time they've been pressuring me to end things with my BF, I've heard all sorts of horrible things from them. My dad, for one, pretty much revealed himself to be someone who can't love his kids unconditionally, and that he can really only go as far as supporting us as long as we don't go against him. He said that he'd rather see me old, unhappy, and unmarried than happily married to my Filipino BF, or a Filipino in general. He said that the only time he'd probably let me be in a relationship or marry a Filipino is if said Filipino were rich and/or powerful enough that it'd be stupid to refuse the offer. And then my parents and one of my meddling sisters then proceeded to accuse Filipinos and other foreigners of being mere gold-diggers. (Yet based on the shit they've been spewing, they're the ones who are acting more like it. In fact, my parents praised my sister for being ""wise,"" because she said that unlike me, she won't follow her heart and will find someone who's rich and who has it all. Yet when I accused her of being a gold-digger, she said that she's not that kind of person.)

They also try their hardest to invade my privacy, and they've already done so a few times. It also helped that I've had a few stupid, careless moments when I forgot to log out from some of my accounts. Now they've got transcripts of some private conversations - and, unfortunately, some particularly bad ones when I was having a bad day and bitching about them. I'm not sure if they'll make them public if ever I run away or something. I'm a bit afraid that they might, but not so afraid to the point that I'd break up with my BF just because of the folks trying to cause a scandal. Also, I don't really know how to prove it, but I just fear that some of my gadgets are bugged.

They've met and talked to my BF a few times but they've already decided that they don't like him. What's even more horrible is that they acted rather two-faced with him - they told him about the problem with interracial relationships in the eyes of traditional Chinese, and that they'd leave it to us to decide on our future. Yet when my BF said that he wanted to continue being with me, behind his back, they gave me crap for not doing what they expected me to do. They play up all his flaws and/or pretty much anything they see about him that doesn't jive with traditional Chinese culture. For instance, they dislike their work ethic, just because he's an office worker (his finances are stable) and he doesn't take work home. They see that as laziness, just because he doesn't own a business, unlike the typical Chinese here. They say contradictory things about him (e.g. ""I don't have anything bad to say about him, but he's not Chinese"" but then sometimes, it's ""He's lazy and complacent; your life will go down the drain if you be with him""), but in the end, it all boils down to the fact that they don't like him, and seeing as they're antisocial (and thus, not familiar with many normal social conventions), the few people they talk to just validate their very conservative beliefs, and they hold grudges, I doubt that anything short of a miracle or my BF magically becoming Chinese will like him. Not even his learning Chinese for me has impressed them. As my dad said, he'd rather see me marry a Chinese asshole than a good foreigner. I've even been threatened with eventual disownment, yet, despite my fear, I don't want to back down.

I feel that whether or not I end up together with my BF ultimately should be up to me, so I want to let this relationship grow on its own instead of having things nipped in the bud by my folks. Right now, I can really see a future with him. I may not have a pampered life with him, because he's not as well-off as my parents (but that's because he's self-made, and besides, he's not poor), but I know that with him, I'll have one thing my parents never had: a happy, loving marriage. My parents don't see the importance of love; I think they only got married for convenience. My dad belittles my mom a lot, and they often yell at each other in front of us, yet my mom seems to look up to my dad. So they're trying to convince me that love isn't what keeps a marriage together, hence, I should fall in love with and marry a Chinese, or else I'll be ostracized. They can't seem to comprehend that I have different values.

Most people have been advising me to just focus on earning as much money as I can and then eventually moving out. However, for most Asians, that's easier said than done, isn't it? It isn't so much the finances as it is the psychological conditioning we've gotten all our lives, not to mention the guilt and the shame. My BF and I know that, if I move away from them, I'm doing it for myself and am determined to make it with or without my family and my BF (but we're really doing our best to stay together no matter what, and he's been incredibly patient). But, for sure, they're going to make sure other people like them will see that I left my family for a man, and am therefore an ingrate and rotten child. I think this is what's difficult for me. I've been considered as a model child all my life; my relatives even tell my cousins that I'm a role model. Yet if I break free from them to forge my own path, I'm sure I'll be vilified big-time because of my reputation as a model child (which I never even asked for - I did like being an achiever, but I didn't want to be put on a pedestal because that meant that I could never make mistakes in their eyes). At the same time, I do feel distant from traditional Chinese society, mainly because of the fact that many elders act like my parents - some are even worse - so I suppose I don't mind not being in contact with such people. I'm really confused, so I'd appreciate the advice. The only thing I know for sure, right now, is that I do not want to break up with my BF because of the pressure. I want us to continue to be happy, and I even hope we'll get married. He says he's working hard so that he can eventually propose, but I'm scared - what if, when he proposes, I'll get cold feet? So yeah, insights would be much appreciated.

**TL;DR - I'm in an interracial relationship, and the parents are being incredibly manipulative, and, despite meeting my BF only once, they choose to go by their initial impressions of him and insist they know his type well already. They're pressuring me to end things with him because of his race, so I need your advice.**",,False,self,t5_2u8j6,False,,,True,t3_17p3uo,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/17p3uo/im_a_filipino_chinese_based_in_the_philippines/,

1. They come to the conclusion that their friends/acquaintance have it so much better than they do. They go into heated arguments about every thing about why that is and start blaming each other. Then they feel bad about themselves and sometimes go into 2. or just tire themselves out. 

2. Start pointing at everything that could/is wrong with that friend's life. They could compare me to their friend's daughter or compare themselves. Then go on about how in reality they are much better and they have made all the right decisions.

I'm in deep shit here. I'll be graduating from college in June and let's just say, it's been a hard 4 years.  It's a long story, but I hope you can bear with me.

It started when I started dating my ex in high school and I went over to his place after graduation, telling my dad I was with other friends as well. When my dad came to pick me up, he realized I was all alone with my ex and that's when the trouble began.

We flew back to Korea, he insisted that I was never going back to the US for college. All summer he banned me from the Internet, from keeping in contact with any of my high school friends. It was difficult but I pulled through, but things didn't get much better when I started college. He told me that I was not allowed to travel without his permission, and that I should record whatever money I spent, and he would call me on my dorm phone during weekends to make sure I was home. After a year of that, I got a job on campus for the summer, but my dad refused to let me take it. Being financially dependent, there was nothing I could do. I had to fly home (which was California at the time, my family moved there for a year), where I knew no one, was unemployed, and had nothing to do. I stayed in my room all day and had no social interaction with anyone other than my family for 3.5 months. By the end I was going crazy and throwing up everything I ate, had severe insomnia, contemplated suicide, etc. This experience fucked me up for the next year or so, despite the fact that I got a job on campus to pay for visits to my ex and I found a way to reroute my dorm phone to my cell.

At the end of sophomore year, I broke up with my ex and started dating a new guy. I kept the relationship a secret for almost a year and a half, telling my mother (who is considerably more reasonable) a month or two before I told my father. When I told him, he said that since I was an adult, he was not going to treat me the way he did before, and I was pleasantly surprised. I had hope that maybe he would change.

Winter break of senior year, I wanted to move off campus as I only had to work on a BA thesis, since I had completed my course requirements. I mentioned it to my mother but I guess it never came up with my dad, probably because we never speak (I hate his guts - can you blame me?). He calls me and accuses me of lying to his face and that he does not trust me or believe anything I say anymore. I calmly apologize and state that I never meant to hide anything, it just never came up, and that if I knew that it would make him so upset, I would never have done it. I even ask him why this upsets him so much, if he could please explain it? However, he fails to give me a straight answer and continues to scream at me and call me an untrustworthy ingrate of a daughter, and demands that I pack my  bags and come home right away. And I lost it.

I literally saw red. I screamed bloody murder that no, I will not do what he asks, and demanded to know how long he planned on telling me what to do. I told him that I hated him and that's why I never called, and that he made me wish I was never born, and I begged him to kill me because I would rather die than spend another moment dealing with his bullshit. He had never heard me act this way so he was taken aback. He said I should just live there on my own without his help, and I said fine. He hung up, and called back (in the meantime my mom called me to make sure I wasn't going to hurt myself - she's a sweetheart like that). He asked me what I wanted from him and I told him that I wanted him to stop telling me what to do, that I was going to live my own life and make my own choices. He was affronted by this, and literally asked me ""how could you say this to me?"" to which I replied, ""If you didn't want my honest opinion, why did you even ask?"" He was silent. He said he couldn't do that, and that if that was my condition, he could never see or talk to me again. I told him that's fine. I could tell he was horrified, I could hear his stunned silence over the phone. We hung up and I came home to see my grandpa one last time before he passed away and attend his funeral (he had cancer, this is totally unrelated).

Since then, we've had a bit of tension. He basically pretended the whole thing never happened, and I've informed him and my mom that I'm staying in the US after graduation, even if I don't have a job locked down (I don't yet, I'm still looking - I do have an internship to keep me busy until August), and they are obviously not okay with that. Which brings me to my present situation.

I'm thinking of declaring independence from my family. I'm thinking of writing my mom an e-mail (not my dad; he's beyond saving) about how emotionally crippled I've become because of my dad, how I've been taking antidepressants on and off throughout my college career, how I've contemplated overdosing on painkillers so my suffering could end. I plan on telling her that he has traumatized me so greatly that there is no way I could be happy while living under his roof, even for a moment. I plan on telling her that from now on, I will make my own decisions, and I fundamentally disagree with the notion that they seem to hold about my life, which is that it is a collective decision. It's my decision, and mine only.

My boyfriend and I have been together for two years (he's white, and my dad is opposed to this - he thinks mixed babies are doomed for a life of misery, don't ask why. my mom doesn't like him because he's not rich and therefore cannot take care of me, but she is more accepting of the fact that money is not important to me and I love who I love). We plan on moving in together. Some of my friends think I shouldn't tell my parents, but I'm tired of hiding my true self. I feel as though they should accept who I am, and if they can't, that's on them.

I should probably mention that I am not Asian-American. I'm Korean by ethnicity and citizenship. I've spent 13 years in the United States total though, and I'm basically white. My dad refuses to accept this, but I think it's time that I cut him out of my life if this is the case.

What do you guys think? Do you think the e-mail and honesty is a good idea? Do you think some things just can't be communicated, and that I should maintain the relationship I have with them now, telling them virtually nothing about my life and speaking to them only out of obligation? I'm extraordinarily unhappy, and have been so for years. I want more than anything to sort this out and begin the next chapter of my life as a happy person.

That was long, but I hope at least one person reads it and responds. I just feel so hopeless all the time.

I have attended middle school, high school and university in Canada. As a result, my English is far superior to my supposedly mother tongue of Mandarin. One year in university when I went to live in Shanghai for four months, I found that I defined my self by my Western rather than Eastern values. 

Since then, I have found myself increasingly distant from my parents. My Mandarin is at a grade 3 level and cannot express the complexity of my thoughts to anywhere as good as English. Unfortunately, their English is only somewhat better than my Chinese. Their views on society and social interactions is still very much focused on the more traditional Eastern values. In many ways, the few friends they have are Chinese couples who merely reinforce their values and beliefs. My father still harbors the dream of immigrating back to China and retiring there! 

Communication is hard enough even in the same language. This problem has gotten exemplified as I introduced my Caucasian BF who clearly does not speak Mandarin. My parents don't like his appearance already and the fact that they can't communicate on any significant level makes for a strained relationship.

I remember learning the times table kneeling in the corner while my family ate dinner and reciting them. Every time I got one wrong, my dad would hit me and I'd have to start over. 

As an adult, my dad has relaxed and pretty much leaves me alone unless it's about money or time. My mom, on the other hand, tries to physically intimidate me by pushing me, hitting me, blocking my way, throwing things at me, etc. When she gets really upset, her blood pressure spikes and she's prone to popping a blood vessel in her eye or getting a bloody nose. 

I'm really not sure how to handle it because my options are to let her nag the fuck out of me and then get mad when I don't do what she says, or to cut her out of my life forever and not talk to her again. She's not a reasonable person and she refuses to listen to anyone because she thinks that she is always the victim and that she's too nice and caring and we don't appreciate her and abuse her. 

In public, she will do really crazy stubborn things that make a scene. Like if she gets pissed off at a restaurant, she will slam dishes/slam the table really hard. Or if she's shortchanged a few cents (on two occasions that come to mind, 2 cents, and 15 cents), she will yell at a person and start to physically intimate them by invading their space. Which is funny because she's 5'1 and an old wrinkly lady. I usually hold onto her arm and try to hold her back because I don't want someone taking a swing at my mom (which has happened several times!) and it ends up being this weird pushing/pulling fight where I end up letting go because I don't want someone crying elder abuse on me. I usually just walk out and sit in the car until someone else deals with her at this point. 

My brother and I have this unsaid agreement where we pick up our mom when the other one gets too frustrated with her and we leave her wherever we are at. 

For the record, my mom doesn't think she's ever hit me and thinks I'm making it up. She has so much denial in her life. (I'm 29 and she's 75)

I adore each of my students, who all happen to be Asian. I, however, was not prepared for the intense pressures that the Tiger Mom's would impose upon me.

 I want to state that I went to a state school because my parents did not believe in investing in their daughters education, but I had previously won awards for my writing, wrote for my college newspaper, and presently, a vast majority of my job involves drafting business contracts. Read: I did not attend Harvard, but I am still above average when it comes to writing.  

Now, one set of the parents love me because I can get their fourth grader to write elaborate essays with disciplines such as linguistics or molecular biology. One student of mine recently got into a competitive writing program for middle school students hosted by a top university.  These parents have pooled together to urge me to quit my job and do this full time. 

However, others are routinely frustrated that I do not force their children to toil through vocabulary worksheets or other ""test prep"" materials. This is what I would call the Tiger Mom set. These parents also happen to have children who treat every lesson as painful, while other kids read and write independently without force tactics. 

Should I concede that these parents are on the right track for prioritizing test prep as a means to the Ivy Leagues? Or, should I go with my obstinate American philosophy, which maintains that only strategic hard work combined with creative problem solving will pay off after college?

It's more like a description and then a plea that I'm running out of places to share. [I posted a stripped version of this experience on /r/asianamerican,](http://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1hwzqe/whether_i_like_it_or_not_and_i_dont_i_hate_it_so/) and it wasn't received well. (I'm writing this an hour after I wrote that, so who knows. It might be doing well by now.)  

To preface this, I saw and saved a great reddit post that has to do with a large part of some of our cultures. Here it is:  

&gt; You are expected to repay your parents' kindness of giving birth and raising you by unfailingly following orders and taking care of them in their old age. It's been part of the culture for thousands of years. Hell, it's still a thing NOW. For example - a new blockbuster film called ""Saving General Yang"" came out just recently about how seven warrior sons ride off to war at great personal cost to save their father, who is trapped behind enemy lines. It's an old, old story that's been a part of Chinese folk mythology for hundreds of years and there's been thousands of novels, operas and movies on this general theme. This is held up to be what we should aspire to as children, and it's hard to buck thousands of years of cultural conditioning.  

I see this as a problem, not because I don't agree with this philosophy but because I don't agree with my set of parents applying it to me. They are abusive. My dad is an alcoholic drug addict, and my mom is a brainwashed enabler who locks doors on her children so no one sees the violence that happens inside. They've sacrificed for me, but they also sacrificed me for themselves. If my dad hadn't chased me around the house with knives as a kid, or if he hadn't forced me to eat burnt food when I didn't cook his meals correctly, or if my mom hadn't turned a cold ear when I'd tell her all this stuff, maybe I'd want to help them into retirement. But they didn't, and I don't.  

Still, I'm their plan A. I'm all they have to give them food, to keep them in a house, to pay their bills. I have no reason to love my dad, and I want nothing more than to shed all memory of him from my life, but if my only other options to let people rot with literally no money for the last 30 years of their life, then I simply don't have that option. I'm not going to be a killer.  

I moved across the country for school to get away from them the best way I knew how, but I'm a year away from graduation and I don't know what to do next. I don't want to move back home, but I want to protect my mom. She can't move away with me because she can't find a job anywhere else (she's only working a good based on tenure) and she's incapable of making new friends. My best option right now is to move somewhere near home, pay for my place and theirs, and let her live with me until one of them dies.  

So there it is. I can either shed myself of really shitty parents and start a new life, at the same time leaving them with literally no money to last them the next 30 years, or I can sell those devils my soul and let them die in comfort. I've seen a lot of stories on here about people putting up with emotionally, physically, or financially abusive parents, but I've yet to see anyone mention any sort of plan to deny their parents the power over the child's future. From those stories I've read and from what I think I'm beginning to realize, this seems inevitable. I'm their retirement fund. It's not a choice I have. It's a destiny. I'm tied to them. That's just how it is, isn't it?  

Please, someone help me. I throw fits just thinking about this. If this is anywhere near your life, too, what are you going to do? For older people, what did you do? I just need a clue.

1341449342.0,20,self.AsianParentStories,w20bm,DAE feel like having asian parents stunted them as human beings?,qzbky,24,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/w20bm/dae_feel_like_having_asian_parents_stunted_them/,"This mainly applies to Asians not living in the countries in which their parents behavior was the norm.

So you were under a lot of pressure by your parents to perform academically or otherwise be a very goal-driven person. I think for some people, this wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the effects later in life: you're never sure what you're doing is being a slave to or a rebellion against what your parents did. Your bad experiences with your parents, and if you're in America, bad experiences with over and covert racism have defined you as a person, i.e., when you examine your actions you can't help but put it in one of these frameworks:

1. Making my parents happy
2. Showing my parents how shitty they were
3. Making whoever is interacting with me happy
4. Rebelling against whomever is interacting with me because of perceived racism
5. (If you're female) Being a submissive but exotic and hypersexualized (or rebelling against that stereotype, perhaps by adopting feminist principles)
6. (If you're male) Being a submissive and desexualized (or rebelling against that stereotype, perhaps by adopting PUA principles)

My experience has been that, no matter how much I try to fake myself into the world view of ""I'm my own  person and I make my own choices"" it never feels genuine, since I always feel like it falls under the framework above. I can never trust my own instincts as I feel they've been corrupted at a basic level. All I can do is watch myself perform actions that vaguely seem to be willed by myself, and at times obviously because I've been trained to be a doormat and concede to others. Then when I try to assert myself I'm treated like an ""uppity"" Asian. It's why I feel suicidal a lot of the time. I'm surrounded by people who seem to have got it together, in terms of knowing what they want in life, but also in terms of feeling, at the gut level, that they have created meaning in life for themselves.

Which is why it's so painful to read these stories, because they all sound like accounts of extreme emotional abuse tome. Sorry, but your parents were terrible and it makes me boil with anger inside whenever someone goes ""Oh, but they weren't that bad, because I understood where they were coming from, now that I'm in a professional/romantic/social situation that they approve of!"" That's very much like the words of an abused person with stockholm syndrome identifying with their abuser, covering up many aspects of their current life that aren't perfect, not someone who has actually grown up and accepted the uncomfortable truth that how they were treated and using their very visceral awareness of their own free will to move on with their lives in their own direction. 

I was wondering if anyone else here actually feels or felt this way, and if so, if they ever found a way out of it. I feel that people like me are just never going to grow up and _truly feel grown up_ if they don't like, start the whole parenting process over with non-terrible people.

I obviously haven't found a way out of this yet. Recently, I've read http://www.conradbaars.com/Baars-books.htm#BOO for a similar perspective; the idea is that people are too smart to self-deceive themselves into feeling like they're worthy people; at a basic level we all need outside evidence in the form of other people who show love to us in order for us to feel worthy; they need to affirm our existence as not machines who _do_ things, but _people_ who just _are_ and deserve to be loved just as they are. 

Asian parents do the opposite; they train a fundamental belief in the child that whatever worth they have is in what they do, for others. And this is where I'm going to say some ugly truths. This is where I'm going to say that the stereotypes are true. 

Why so many stereotypes about Asians are still perpetuated despite how harmful they are: The parents can't help but turn their children into walking stereotypes, because of the dehumanizing view that they take toward their children. Most of us aren't in leadership positions because doing so might actually require connecting with people, which requires that you have some sort of presence _as a person_,which we pretty were designed not to do (we were designed to do things _for_ people). Asian men do badly in relationships because of this plus the near universal requirement that the male is the proactive, initiating one in the relationship, and asian women do quite well, at least in attracting dominant types who need them to occupy as small a psychological space as possible. 

And merely recognizing that this is the problem, that our parents have shaped us into _less than human_ beings, doesn't help very much. We need to be aware, every second, of our motivations behind our actions---so that eventually, we can play at being real people. But instinctually? I feel that everything I do in this direction goes against what I've been trained---it is like running ""in software"" what well-parented people have been running ""in hardware"" all their lives. There is a little bit of hope though---I think there is an ever more basic instinct that takes over sometimes, that leads to an instinctual rejection of the parental training itself. That doesn't mean, however, that I haven't changed my ""life goal"" to kill myself as soon as I can set my affairs in order and alienate the last few people in my life.

As a side note, I'm wondering if anyone has any, perhaps sociologically based, theories about how the Asian parenting style might be successful in Asian cultures, where society is highly stratified and people are mired in the structure from the start. In these situations, many aspects of a person's life is already set up for them, so it is more viable to ""direct"" people to certain ends.",,False,self,t5_2u8j6,False,,,True,t3_w20bm,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/w20bm/dae_feel_like_having_asian_parents_stunted_them/,

I'm in my last year of college for art school and I've been dating this guy for over two years now. During the end of my sophomore year, I move into this house with my boyfriend and some of our friends, then this past march the two of us moved again but into our own apartment this time. I'm currently doing a paid internship that I use to fund my apartment and some other things so it's not too much of a burden on my parents because they are helping me pay what I can't get in loans and grants for school. Overall, pretty sweet deal.  
My parents knew that I was living with some friends but they had no clue about the boyfriend or the living together. 
Reason being because:
1)I'm use to hiding things from them or else they'll nag at me non-stop 
2)The first person I dated was a female, definitely could not tell them for fear of being disowned in high school 
3)My sister started dating at a younger age than I did and has had a couple more boyfriends in the recent years, they're always harping on how she's never respecting her body and how disappointed they are with her and her boyfriend choices
4)coincidentally, boyfriend is non-chinese

Recently, my parents have been asking if I'm seeing anyone and we've had some nice conversations about the subject. Strangely enough, I guess because I'm the oldest and most responsible (also they've told me a few times that I'm the favorite), they said they'd be fine with me dating someone not chinese. So I ended up telling them I was seeing someone (didn't say we were living together or anything) and even had them meet him in an informal setting. Went awkward as heck but I can't complain!

So I'll definitely end up telling them I'm living with him by the time I'm done college, since they expect me to move in with them again back in the suburbs (-_-;; aways from any good graphic design jobs places...) 

I'm extremely surprised by this progress since a couple years before they'd lecture me about only dating Fuzhounese men and not dating while I'm still in school. Maybe they've grown more lenient because they know I won't be going into any of their dream occupations for their kids. Being an art student and all. xD 
My dad's talked about a few of his friends not getting along or not talking to their kids over dating issues. He said he doesn't want that to happen because he knows we have a hard time talking about anything as it is already. However both my mom and dad still complain about my sister because they know her dating history. Also probably because she's smarter so they're trying to get her to concentrate more on her college courses. 

Feels good that things are looking up and my parents actually seem to be getting reasonable.

I have a pretty good paying job straight out of university. While I'm currently living at home, I plan on moving out to a small room in a house after my three months probation. My parents didn't like this idea because it ""wastes"" money that could be put towards a down payment on a home. Makes sense so at first I said independence is more important to me. That reason failed. So after saying that the 2 hour commute AND over time (may or may not happen) will hinder my job performance, they budged. I thought that was the end of that discussion. Until today. 

Today, my mom ""asked"" me to agree to her grand idea. The idea is that since I won't have enough down payment for a decent home in a year and my $30k of savings have ""no growth"", I should invest in a town home with them a year after I started my job. So I ask if ""we"" (my parents and my incoming grandmother who is immigrating from China) will live together. She said maybe. Then she went into options about renting out if I don't live there and something about loaning between us. All sounded very complicated. 

The thing is, I live in a place with very high housing prices and to be pragmatic about it, I won't be able to afford a condo for 1.5 years, and a town home for 2-3 years of savings. I frankly prefer to buy a town home with my future husband. My mom had to use the ""our assets are your assets"" which I find... unsettling. She doesn't like me being very ""clear cut"" about finances. 

Is this common? I don't know if this is a cultural thing because I feel that I'm more Western than my parents. I don't want to live at home till I'm married. My mom can also micromanage at times. I sometimes feel my mom sends me on a guilt trip about how hard it was to raise me, how she paid for half of my university and didn't charge me rent for living at home. I care and love my mom but how can I draw that line for my independence? Or maybe I should just use the necessary legal precautions?

My mom called me yesterday and we had a two hour discussion. She lectured me about family values and respect for elders, neither of which I seem to have, while I listened on silently. She said that what I was going through was nothing, and that plenty of parents over in Korea force their kids to attend med school or law school without regard for what the kids want, and compared to those kids, I was lucky. I almost wanted to say that compared to parents with kids who are unemployed heroin addicts with 4 illegitimate children, they were lucky, but I held my tongue.

I told her that the reason why I don't call or called my grandpa before he passed away was because the conversation always ended up where I didn't want it to be, i.e. whether I was applying to graduate school in my senior year, living in Korea, going to school in Korea, etc. I told her that it gave me a physical feeling, like something is sitting on my chest restricting my breathing, and that I got the same sort of feeling when I was back home visiting them. I told her that was why I didn't want to come home that winter but eventually I did after I realize that my grandpa had mere days to live. I told her that I wasn't proud of what I did, and that I should have called my grandpa regularly despite my feelings since he didn't have long to live, but I wasn't a strong enough person to overcome my anxiety, and I regret that. I told her that the way I handled my grandpa's death was definitely my fault.

She said that this was life, that life was filled with unhappiness and dissatisfaction, and it's just something I have to overcome. ""Everyone's a little bit depressed,"" she said. ""Everyone is unhappy with what their parents ask them to do, but we do it anyway."" I didn't know what to say. How do you describe the sun to someone who has never seen the light? How could I possibly convince her that life wasn't like this for everyone, and didn't have to be, for someone so trapped within the cultural vice that is Korean society and as a result, never had an opportunity to be her own person? There was nothing I could say, I feel.

She said that I am no longer allowed to do what I would have been allowed to do otherwise (i.e. take the job) because I did not ask for their permission first, and because of my slight, it is my duty to obey them just this once. I told her that nothing that she could say could change my mind, because being pressured into changing a decision that I feel would be best for me by someone else goes against everything I believe in. I also said that we are just different people, and will probably never agree with each other so we should just accept things the way they are. I told her that I was angered by what she said to me the last time we spoke and she didn't apologize, saying that compared to the pain that I have caused her and my dad, what she said was nothing, and that it was just the truth.

After asking me if I needed a day or two to ponder, and upon hearing my response that nothing would change, she said ""okay, I won't bother you anymore. I won't call you anymore. Goodbye"" and hung up the phone. Man, I don't know what I could have done to prevent this. I keep beating myself up for something I don't know how I could have done differently. I know they attribute my sadness to me, and that hurts, because at this point, I don't feel anger toward them at all. I understand that their culture and upbringing has made them who they are, and no one can avoid becoming someone that society shapes you into. 

So, I don't know what's gonna happen next. I'm going to continue living my life as I planned, but it seems as though my parents aren't coming with me. Still, I have a feeling this isn't over yet; I expect any minute to receive another angry call, after which another unproductive conversation will commence.

I don't know why I'm even posting. I'm not asking for advice. Everything's already been done. I guess I just need to talk it out. I need people who understand to hear my story. I guess that's what I want.

My example: while I work in finance now, most of my career I have worked in BPR, or business process reengineering. It's sort of like a Swiss Army knife of a job... anything not doing what you want? Call me. I've worked on stuff ranging from figuring out why customers in a certain geographical area had a lower response rate than other places, to helping a company change how their time card worked to reduce the huge number of errors. You know that corporate adage that all problems are either the people, process, or systems? I always think it is the process. It often is the root cause, and almost always the most cost-effective solution. 

My parents inadvertently taught me this skill in my mid teens. I was not allowed to eat on my own. My mother thought I was too dumb to feed myself. As a result, regardless of the hour or whether she was asleep, if she heard the microwave, my mother would come RUNNING to inspect my food/yell at me. 

As a result, I learned to optimize my microwave use after I realized it was the beeps that my mother could hear. Need to heat something for a minute and a half? Hit 9-0-START instead of 1-3-0-START. One fewer beep. Getting near the end of the microwave cooking time!? Hit CANCEL right when the clock hits 0:00. If you let it go, it will beep four times. Do it at 0:01 or before, either you leave one second on the clock as evidence you were there, or you have to use another beep to clear it off. Do it at 0:00 and there's one beep, and no time remaining in the cook cycle.

Growing up, all my friends were either Chinese, Japanese, Indian, or Korean (with the exception of that one Jewish and one Persian friend). The very few white kids at my school had this weird superiority complex over all of us Asians and that really messed with my perception of how white people are towards Asians. 

Fast forward to now, I've been going to a college in the Midwest where most of my friends are white who grew up in very white neighborhoods. My prejudice against white people has been shed, as I now have many good white friends and realized that those white kids at my school were just assholes. 

THAT BEING SAID. I was just talking to my sister who is a rising senior at my high school, and she was ranting about how frustrating our parents are being about college apps, etc. and basically never let her go out (she only claims to have gone out three times). I offered her big sister advice and attempted to explain why our parents do the unreasonable things they do to help us with our future, which she understands, just needs to hear from me from time to time. 

A good friend of mine (who is a white female) is in the same room while this conversation is happening, and she asks: ""What's wrong?""

I tell her: ""My mom isn't letting my sister hang out with her friends this summer because she wants her to do well on college applications and she's just really sad about it. But same thing happened to me too, so..."" 

*Sidenote: I just ranted to her (my friend) about some study abroad things an hour ago - my mom not letting me travel after my program's over with a good male friend of mine in fear of ""mistakes"" happening, even without my consent, etc. etc.* 

*(Direct quote from my mom: ""Honey, I trust you but you can't prevent mistakes from happening!""*

*Okay, mom.)*

Friend then says, shaking her head, sighing, ""I just don't get why your mom does these things to you and your sister."" 

This surprisingly made me feel like shit because I feel like my mom is being cast in an unfavorable light to my friend - to all my friends at school, sometimes. Like any other normal human being out there, I get frustrated with my parents and will want to talk to someone about it. 

But every time I try to explain my parents and the way they are, I feel like I'm jipped of the opportunity to fully do so and/or that my friends won't understand me. They just look at me like I'm this sad person who had a terrible childhood because my awful strict Asian parents raised me differently than their perfect white parents raised them.

To which I'd like to say, my parents, to me, are perfect in every which way and I could not wish to be raised any differently. We disagree on a crazy amount of things, but I love them more than I can ever express in words. 

They may have hit me, yelled at me, called me a failure, made me cry more times than I can imagine. But they are, to me, the best thing that has ever happened to me, and who are they to judge that? 

**TL;DR - I feel like my white friends think my Asian parents are these soul-sucking demons who have deprived me of a healthy upbringing when it's really just the opposite. Dealing with white friends is new to me because I grew up in a mostly Asian setting and had mostly Asian friends. I feel guilty about this because the impressions that they all have of my parents are in how I talk about them - as I do complain about them from time to time, like all college students with relationships with their parents do.**

1370186261.0,19,self.AsianParentStories,1fisda,That awful moment when you realize that your life is great; it's just your family that are stressing you out.,floatinglotus,22,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1fisda/that_awful_moment_when_you_realize_that_your_life/,"I was thinking about my life lately, and it seems that I'm pretty happy in general; it's just my family that causes me a great deal of stress.

Right now, I:

* have just gotten promoted at work, and working for a company that isn't perfect but that is known for its work-life balance and equal opportunity policies (not to mention, relatively good pay and benefits);

* am in a serious relationship with a loving boyfriend (who, sadly, isn't the same Asian as I am);

* have emotionally (and, in some cases, financially) rewarding hobbies;

* great friends (and even co-workers) who understand and accept me for who I am; and

* got accepted for a master's degree in a good school.

I'm very happy because of those things, but there is no one or nothing else that gives me more stress than my own family. And I don't just mean little annoyances. If you've seen some of my posts on this subreddit, and elsewhere, the stress they give me can be rather unbearable. It's not every day that they're blowing up at me, of course. Most days, they aren't blowing up at me, but it feels like I'm walking on eggshells. Heck, ""treading on landmines"" might even be a more appropriate figure of speech. There's no telling when they'll blow up and start threatening to disown me or whatnot. I don't know if anyone else can relate, but the psychological stress I get from them blowing up at me can, on some days, make me forget how good my life is, my parents' irrationalities notwithstanding.

On an average day, sure, we're civil, but I know that in general, they're pretty displeased with my life choices. It's because as soon as I achieve something, instead of congratulating me, they start focusing on the next better thing that I can do, or they start bringing up some other aspect of my life that they're not happy with, e.g. my having a boyfriend of a different ethnicity. They didn't even congratulate me when I said that I was accepted into this certain school abroad, instead asking why I didn't take an MBA, and focusing instead on how I'd be jobless again after 2 years. (And how are they even sure of that, when, for all I know, I could already be applying for jobs before graduation)?

It's been years, and instead of getting better, they seem to show no sign of changing. I hope they will change for the better, but honestly, I doubt that that will ever happen. Every now and then, I hear heartwarming stories from my friends who also have traditional Chinese parents, e.g. one friend's mom saying that she doesn't exactly like that her daughter's into an artsy hobby, but that she's glad that my friend made a lot of friends through this hobby, because she used to worry that my friend would always be anti-social.

In contrast to that, I've never heard anything like that from my parents; if ever they did congratulate me, it was always for academic matters, and not for ""non-productive"" endeavors, such as socializing. In fact, whereas other parents would be happy that their once anti-social kids are now more sociable, my parents actually wish I was still anti-social, like my one sibling who is anti-social and who thinks like my folks. My mom has even made the logical leap of saying that I won't be successful because I spend time going out with friends. Apparently, going out on weekends is a sign that I am contented with my lot in life. (And even if I was, what's wrong with that?) I also have a lot of other stories, but I'd go on forever if I had to list more of them.

I guess if there's any good that came out of this, I learned that I shouldn't do things for their approval anymore, because even the things that I think will gain their approval either don't, or make them think about the next best goal to strive for. I guess I also learned to be more proactive, except I don't update my parents about stuff like my promotion anymore, because I feel like it's no use.

But I have lived in Asia for the last year and a half now teaching and I have become abundantly aware of the Asian parent phenomenon. I want to laugh about it and think of it as funny, but I just can't. I need some perspective from people who have more life experience with it than I do. 

I am not a prejudiced person, at all. But seeing the way that so many Asians treat their family members has caused me to lose respect for their culture, and for them as individuals. 

The thing is, we so often just excuse people's behavior as ""culture,"" but there's a lot more to it than that. I think they know what they're doing, and that they are doing it to be malicious. And I see no reason to think otherwise. I don't want to be ""that guy"" who thinks that way, but I see no reason to call a spade a spade. 

I have known so many Asian girls who are rail thin and heard nothing from their mothers except how fat and ugly they are, and now have terrible self esteem. They are taught that sex is bad and that you're a slut if you leave the house alone or live alone. Boys are not allowed to go out either, not encouraged to do any kind of activity that allows for social development or creativity. 

Everything they do is designed to foster submissiveness and dependency in their children. Even the things that are supposedly for the kid's well being. Studying 8 hours a day in middle school? This is utter nonsense, there isn't a middle school in the world where this is necessary if you are studying correctly. And there isn't a shred of evidence anywhere that being nothing but a catatonic bookworm makes people successful. Because the goal isn't to make the kid successful - it's to beat him down, and dominate him. 

The Asian parent appreciation for success and hard work is actually nauseatingly childish and superficial. They want bragging rights. They want to send their kid to Harvard so they can smugly say that their kid went to Harvard. They lust for status symbols like some B-list coke fiend celebrity wannabe. It has nothing to do with living a satisfying life, with having children who are fulfilled in their meaningful occupation and at peace with themselves. It's about cheap images of status seeking bullshit. 

I live in Korea now, but one particular friend I had from Bengladesh was repeatedly raped by a family member when she was a kid. They lived in America at the time, and had for a while. When my friend told her mother, her mother literally told her to shut up and not talk about things like that, that it would look bad if people knew. Essentially, the Asian popularity pissing contest was more important to her than the life and well being of her daughter. And this isn't unusual, either. She was very dark skinned, as Bengalis often are. Every time she sees anyone in her family, the only thing she hears is how fat, and ugly, and black she is. And now that she lives in Korea - it's the only thing that she hears from Koreans either. She's a small brown woman, so she has to put up with it. I'm a large, blonde haired, blue eyed man - so Asian people are nice to me. But my friend, who was born and raised in America, is experiencing a very crucial aspect of what we seem to joke about regarding what it means to have Asian parents - that they are shallow, malicious, and care less than nothing about your well being. 

I want to laugh at all of these things but I don't think it's funny. It's abuse. I don't think it's culture. I think it's a whole lot of people who are really rotten people and make malicious choices to act out their rottenness. 

The reason I'm posting it here is that I want there to be something I'm missing. I don't want to think of them this way.  I want to have missed some aspect to the story that someone can point out to me so I can realize that they're not as bad as they seem.

I'm in college right now and trying to figure out my summer plans. The thing is I don't want to stay with my parents this summer because last summer they were absolutely horrible to me,yelling at me all the time over stupid things, trying to control everything I do, and constantly belittling me, especially my mother. She is a very strict, traditional Chinese mother and I don't want to deal with that (or her) again.  

I would like to stay with my boyfriend in his apartment. But then that would require me telling my parents we're dating and since he isn't Chinese, that would lead to constant threatening, manipulating me to break up with him, blackmailing...I could go on. 

The reason I am so docile right now is because my parents are paying my school tuition (most is covered by scholarships and loans but the rest, they pay). I go to a somewhat prestigious, private school and would like to graduate from there. I have two more years left of school. 

I know I can't really do anything to upset my parents because they could withdraw my education funding at any moment. I hate that they have me on this leash but until I graduate, I see no other alternative. 

Hopefully for now, I can appease them with good grades. I also do have an internship lined up for the summer but the organization doesn't have an official office and most of the work I'll be doing for them is via computer (aka staying at home). 

What does everyone think? Should I suck it up and deal with my parents for the summer? Should I tell them the truth about my boyfriend? Or should I lie and tell them I'll be staying in another apartment with a female roommate (when I'll be actually staying with boyfriend)? 

Please, I value your input. Also, stories are welcome too. 

TL;DR: Don't want to stay with overcontrolling parents for the summer, want to stay with non-Asian boyfriend but that could lead to angry parents not paying for school tuition (and possibly jeopardizing future). Stay with parents and suck it up or lie and stay with boyfriend?

Update: Thank you all so much for responding! Your advice helped me alot and I will be considering the options everyone gave. Also my mother recently sent me an email saying she'll ""support everything I choose to do"" (within reason of course) so that ought to count for something! Here's what the email said: Can you call me, I want to know is just I am your Mom, I am care of you. I do support you do anything.

Update 2: Just found out today my entire tuition is covered by scholarships and loans. Since I'm not required to live on campus next year I can pull my own weight, find off campus housing and pay for my own rent. Which means my parents have NO leverage over me! Yes! Still trying to think of an alibi for the summer and they're still going to have to fill out my fafsa for senior year though...

What do you think worked and what didn't for you/others.,jd0098,17,3,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/165nrb/question_about_asian_parenting_successful_kids/,"So, this may seem like a weird question.

But, there is obviously a stereotype in the world that a lot of Asian kids grow up and tend to be more successful than others from other races.  AKA, the stereotype is most Asians are good at math, succeed in school and college, get well paying jobs, etc..  

Also, I have spoken to people from Korea in college.  Many of them were quite knowledgeable and hard working.  They spoke about how there lives were school as kids and they got maybe 5 hours of sleep at most during school.  Not saying I agree with that type of learning environment, but it speaks a lot about how hard working people from Korea in school can be.  

My question is, for those with experience as these kids (or others you knew who experienced this), how do typical Asian parents raise such successful kids?  What ""techniques"" do they use to get there kids to be so self motivated to succeed in school and in life?  

Also, have you seen anything they do that flat out fails?

They lived in a mid-sized city, where my grandfather was a professor and my grandmother was a nurse. My family had significant political power, established through my great-grandfather and with this, developed a degree of wealth and a rebellious reputation. 

During the height of the war, my grandmother would treat wounded American soldiers (my family was highly against the communist party/Viet Cong), my grandfather would supply electricity to a portion of the city through a personally owned generator, and their children would guide the wounded soldiers to their house/hospital from railways and highways. Eventually, the government caught on to my family and took action to stop their services to the people of South Vietnam and American soldiers. In doing so, they took my families house, then placed my great grandfather into a [reeducation camp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reeducation_camp). The rest of the family members were instructed to leave the country. Knowing that they are about to leave everything behind, they had to go to extreme measures to ensure financial stability in their new life. My grandfather, his brothers, and his older sons replaced their teeth with gold implants to smuggle across borders. 

With the money they saved up, they bought their way on to the freighter, [Skyluck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyluck). For nearly 5 months, they would be stuck on the ship, not allowed to land on any neighboring coast, specifically Hong Kong. After some rogue passengers cut the anchor of the Skyluck, the ship crashed into a rocky harbor and sank. 2000 passengers made an attempt to flee into Hong Kong, most were caught and placed into camps, including my family. 

For months, my family would be stuck in these terrible camps, looking for ways to get out. An opportunity occurred, where churches/religious organizations would sponsor refugee families to come to America. Fortunately, my 18 member family was accepted by a church in Michigan and that is where their journey ends. 

**TL;DR** - During the Vietnam War, my family was kicked out due to their rebellious actions, placed in camps for months at a time, and went to extreme lengths to ensure stability in their new life. 

I know this is not a silly/funny/crazy submission, but after hearing about their amazing story, I feel as if my family, especially my father, has the right to be the crazy Asian parent that he is.

So, what amazing stories does your family have? ",,False,self,t5_2u8j6,False,,,True,t3_vdxdj,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/vdxdj/what_stories_do_you_have_of_your_familys/,
1373866405.0,17,self.AsianParentStories,1ibmme,"Oh, great. It just keeps getting worse. Dad is making a fuss out of my plan to study abroad. His controlling siblings and my spiteful sister are joining in the fray.",floatinglotus,21,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1ibmme/oh_great_it_just_keeps_getting_worse_dad_is/,"I've mentioned that ever since I became an adult, my struggle to become my own person has been an uphill battle, with my parents - mostly my dad - steadfastly refusing to ever see me as an adult and give me space to learn things on my own.

Anyway, I got accepted into a prestigious university in Asia; however, this masteral program is not to my dad's liking, because it's not an MBA or anything ""money-making."" Mind you, I already had a bachelor's degree in business, so I figured I might as well pursue something I'm actually interested in this time. The program will start sometime late this year, and since it's just a few months away, my dad and his siblings have been playing mind games with me. It's just insane.

Neither parent congratulated me when they heard I got into the program. My dad was especially apprehensive, even. He kept saying he wasn't sure he'd let me go. (Despite that, I've been trying to pool my finances anyway.) The past few months, every time my dad would start an argument with me, he'd bring the program up and threaten to stop me from going if I didn't do whatever it was that he wanted. I'd usually call his bluff, but somehow, I was sure he'd be unrelenting until the end.


Just recently, he started asking more questions about the program, as if he was already considering helping chip in. However, his siblings started meddling as well. Dad grew up in a dysfunctional family (though they refuse to admit it and think that their family dynamics are healthy), in which my domineering grandma instilled in their heads that their family alone is important, and that they must be unflinchingly loyal at all costs - which his siblings, all unmarried because they wanted to devote themselves to their family and the family business, have taken to mean that they also have a say in everything we do. 


The siblings have the funds to shoulder my expenses, so they started calling, assuming that I'd need to rely on them. (I could use extra funds but if they're going to hold it over my head, no thanks.) One aunt is rather two-faced, so she called and subtly tried to talk me out of studying abroad. ""Hmm... why don't you study something related to handling money? Are you sure that it's worth it for you? Well, we only want what's best for you and of course, we're not going to impose, we really aren't, but we just want to make sure that it's worth it, you know..."" (But mom said that behind my back, they've been explicitly clear that they don't think my course is useful, and want to stop me from going.)


I said I was still determined to go, and that even if I wasn't able to get any scholarships beforehand, I'd find some once I get to my host country. My dad even said that he'd at least shoulder the airfare, and he bought me a plane ticket. So I thought things were already going well, and that that settled things.


Enter my younger sister. She's the middle child, and is rather antisocial, untrustworthy, and vindictive. She's also known to be a tattletale, and has major anger issues against the world at large. Last night, apparently, out of spite and resentment built up from **childhood squabbles**, she called my conservative, controlling relatives and squealed that I have a non-Chinese BF. She even e-mailed them pictures and chat logs that she found from breaking into my accounts before. Even my dad, who's against the relationship, was livid that my sister did that, because it was an affront to his pride. My mom gave me hope last night because, even though she may think I'm selfish and isn't exactly happy about the relationship as well, she chewed my sister out, calling her a traitor, brown-noser, and wannabe hero. She said that she (my sister) sold me out merely out of resentment. My sister said that she did that so that I'd be forced to fund my studies myself, or that, at worst, I wouldn't push through with further studies.

Mom called her on her BS, saying that whether or not my parents will fund me is none of her business, and that she doesn't believe that those were my sister's intentions. Indeed, my sister could have asked me directly how I planned to finance my studies. Mom also thinks that she wants me to fall out of favor with my relatives, who have an extremely idealized image of me, just because I'm quiet and an achiever. (If they bothered to know me, they'd have known I'm a lot more than that - I can also be emotional, crack a dirty joke, etc.) My sister also admitted that she did that because she thinks I'm selfish, and that she also did it in the hopes that if my parents couldn't get me to break up with my BF, my relatives would. I don't really know what to say to my relatives yet, as they haven't talked to me, but I know for sure that I don't want to give in to them.


So now my dad's holding my plane ticket hostage. Since last night, he's been saying, ""You know, we can always cancel this booking..."" And he said he'd stop me from going abroad if I still insisted on it. Basically, he doesn't want me to take that course (and to get something he prefers) and he wants me to break up with my BF. I don't know what he'd do, though, to stop me from going abroad. I fear he might actually physically restrain me from leaving, but I hope not.


As usual, we had a conversation in which he kept on insisting on his and his siblings' way, but he refused to acknowledge that he/his siblings are selfish. He said that I'm the one who's selfish because I want to achieve personal success, and not some kind of success that even my dad and relatives can be proud of. He said that I should bow down to thousands of years of Chinese tradition. When I said that I don't agree with many outdated traditions, he said that I should, *because.* Moreover, he started guilt-tripping me about all the love, care, and support that he and his siblings have shown me over the years, saying that the way to give back to them is to submit to them. He also said other unbelievable things, such as how I should be thankful that, unlike other people, he didn't warn my BF to stay away from me, nor did he beat my BF up. (Why should I be thankful to someone for not being an asshole when it's expected?) He also said that he supposes that going abroad to study something he doesn't like would be a lesser evil because at least it'll mean that me and my BF will be physically apart. When I asked him how he can be happy doing things that clearly make other people unhappy and not call himself selfish, he said that parents are always right, and that he's doing what he knows is best for me. He said that if I don't listen to him and continue doing what I'm doing, he won't be there for me if I stumble. But - wow, some nerve - if I somehow become successful, he'll definitely be there and exclaim, ""That's my daughter!""


Meanwhile, my sister, the dirty coward who can't even look me in the eye and asked to sleep in my parents' room last night (mind you, she's a college student), is enjoying all the flak I'm getting. 


The stress is piling up and driving me insane. How do I continue standing my ground? What kind of things should I tell them? Technically, I am moving out by going abroad, so now it's a matter of knowing how to face them and not back down.

**TL;DR: In effect, it feels like my dad and his siblings won't let me go abroad for further studies because they don't like my course, but they might reconsider if I break up with my BF. I think this is a sadistic choice and a foul move. Besides, if I give in to that single condition, who's to say they'll not renege, and that they'll stop trying to keep me in line?**

**Update: it gets worse, as they're trying all sorts of tactics to manipulate me into not going. My dad told my kid sister - the youngest - I'm going to leave her behind, and now he's telling me not to go so my youngest sister won't cry. The relatives also keep pestering me to call them for a talk on family values, obedience, and giving back to the family. Apparently they can't sleep, are very sad, etc. Unlike my dad, they're more subtle because their manipulation is disguised as niceties. They don't outright tell me to do this or that, but they keep giving me lectures about the values of humility, submission, and obedience. They're Christians - the kind that gives good Christians a bad name - so they also often use religion to justify their beliefs.**",,False,self,t5_2u8j6,1374305890.0,,,True,t3_1ibmme,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1ibmme/oh_great_it_just_keeps_getting_worse_dad_is/,

It's almost like being in the military, the discipline and the pressure to succeed is crazy. I don't need to elaborate on the bad things this can give us. We all know.

At the same time, being lenient has it's bad points. I'm actually on that side, my parents were strict in some areas but were pretty lenient with grades. I felt the effects of this now that I'm in med school. I tried to explain to people how the situation is, and please bear with me as I explain and please don't take some sentences out of context.

People seem to think that failure is on the student. I'd like to argue that it's not. First of all, this isn't a black and white thing, my point merely is that it's a multi-factorial thing, but it is very much rooted in how you were brought up. Simply, if I wasn't trained to do well in an area (in a game, say, I have all the weapons/armors/power-ups/upgrades) and I was put in a difficult environment barely prepared (low level n00b), even if I do my absolute best, why is my failure completely my doing? It could be rooted to WHERE I was put to school, or how much pressure was given to me to study, etc.

Heck, even how my parents look at me is part of this. When you're treated as an adult who is meant to understand the WHYs and the HOWs and what-not, the likelyhood of following is greater than merely just saying, ""THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET INTO BETTER SCHOOLS ETC"".

At the same time, I know that leniency will not force me to get higher grades. Of course, intelligence isn't something you can measure, but until there's a change in the grading system thing, this is the only way we can prove we're smart enough for the rest of the world. I'd probably just get high grades in stuff I'm REALLY interested in, but we all know that there are multiple steps to a path and if I wasn't disciplined enough, I'd take shortcuts or become a total n00b about things and just think something like, ""Oh, I'm okay with what I have now."" I'm talking getting into better schools in different countries and etc. I'm even afraid I'm not gonna pass the USMLE and get a high enough grade to be accepted into residency in America.

I repeat, this isn't a black and white thing. It's not completely the fault of my parents (who governed my schooling) and it's not completely my fault for not being smart enough. There are things outside their control, say, what if I gain friends who are dumb and have stupid parents that are allowing them to be dumb and I got influenced etc.

Now my question is, is there a better way? That bit I said about being treated as an adult is VERY difficult. Even with our generation, one that is obviously gonna be a lot closer to our children, will probably have a hard time explaining things to our kids. I mean, they're kids. Not all of them will mature in time to see your point. You know? Ugh I'm having a really hard time explaining this, but I'm sure you guys know what the hell I'm talking about. 

I'm really sorry if my thoughts are disjointed and what-not. I really think you guys know what I'm talking about and some of you have probably thought about it too. Maybe we can all discuss it here.

These past few years have been the time where my mothers manipulation of me has started to wear off. I now realize why my dad would get mad at her so often and is generally annoyed and unhappy with her.

First off, my mom does not operate on a normal schedule. She wakes up at around 11 and goes to work and 12 and insists on working until 9 at night. She also does not drive so my dad and more recently me would have to pick her up when she feels like going home. This caused me to have to stay in my parents office well into the night while my dad and I waited for her and not have dinner until usually 10PM. When I told her I was hungry she would just hand me a box of saltine crackers. This waiting ceased when my grandparents moved here and I could go home and eat. However, this is just the beginning.

My mom is extremely selfish. She does not like spending money on anyone including my grandparents. Whenever my grandma puts something in the cart, my mom puts it back. All the while, my mom spends tens of thousands buying luxury goods that she never uses just because she can. What does this have to do with me? Well, to put it simply my mom steals money from me. A few years ago before I confronted her during the summer of last year she would grab my wallet every night and take however much I had in there and leave me only ten dollars. Last year after I graduated high school, my uncle mailed me $1000 as a graduation present but my mom took it and I had no idea of it until my grandma asked me if I have gotten the money and I still haven't. My mom is self centered and only cares about herself. Now I understand why my dad would get mad at her so frequently when I was a child.

The past few weeks she has taken this to a new level. Since we have a family owned business, my mom expects me to work there. That isn't a problem. The problem is that she is mistreating me as an employee. For one she has told me that she would have to pay someone more than she is paying me to do the work that she makes me do. In addition, she never gives me enough hours so whatever money I earn goes towards my own survival and well-being since she cuts me off from my allowance when I start working. Also, when I work she is constantly micro managing me when she knows full well that I can do my work. She jumps to conclusions every chance she gets and yells at me for making a mistake when there isn't one. I couldn't take this anymore so I have stopped working completely.
Now she's trying to ruin my life by completely cutting me off. I have eaten cup noodles for the majority of my meals for the past three weeks since my grandparents went out of country. I have started to use the money in my savings account to buy a decent meal here and there and my dad occasionally buys me a meal when my mom is not around. I also have a digestive issue that I have been dealing with and I need to go to the doctor for a check up this week but she won't make an appointment for me because she doesn't want to pay the $40 copay.

She has even told everyone else in the family that she would take away my car by not paying my insurance if my grades dropped which is ridiculous because my grades are completely fine and my dad even called her crazy for even thinking of doing something like that.

I don't know what I should do. I know I have to confront her soon but I really don't know what my plan is or what I should say. My mom is quite honestly bad for my life and my health and I know if this continues it will begin to affect my academic and personal life.

I'm a first generation Chinese American who's lived in the US with my nuclear family for about 15 years now. My dad has always struggled with some anger issues, trouble expressing his emotions without becoming emotionally abusive, etc. But it's my mother that's the most troubling. I was way too young to have known she was always struggling with depression, but lately as I've grown older it's becoming harder and harder to ignore. I remember her having fights with my dad growing up, and she would always be the one to get physical first with objects, and even sometimes my dad. She's a tiny woman so there was obviously no physical danger. Lately I've noticed that she has all these marks on her arms and I seriously think she's been self-harming. Her sister's family just moved in with us and it's causing a lot of tensions between her and my dad, along with dredging up a lot old family drama that apparently never got resolved from twenty-something years ago.

There's been a few scary instances that I thought my mother became a serious danger to herself. Not just limited to smashing plates and stuff (like I'm used to) but in a really awful way scratching herself and screaming that she wants to die. I've threatened to call the ER on her several times but my family always made me back off from it because ""that's not what [Chinese] families do."" When my mom was calm I tried to talk her into seeing a psychologist, and I think she did, but then later she told me it didn't help and they didn't really understand her or her problems. I've talked to my dad about it too and he said it was true--they actually went together, but my mom wouldn't listen to a single word the psychologist said, and there was no way you can just force someone to take medication or go to therapy.

These maniacal episodes aren't happening all the time btw. I don't want to make it sound like it's all doom and gloom. But it'll happen probably twice a year, at some major argument. I've moved away now for college, but I still hear about it from my dad, and it worries the shit out of me. I have a little brother in middle school and I wish she would just divorce my dad since she seems to hate him but won't do it for the sake of ""keeping the family together.""

Is there no hope for us? I feel like for a psychologist to actually work he/she needs to share the same cultural background as my mother.

Finally at the end of all this, they call my name. Instead of getting one of those round cases that holds a drum, I get this rotting black rectangular case. I ask where my drum is. The guy from the music store says nope right here it says you get an OBOE. WTF??? I went to one band practice and quit. What happened? Over the next couple years I pieced it together after talking to the band teachers. When I passed the tryout I came home all excited and told my parents about it. The next day, they went to my school to talk to the band director. This conversation happened:

* mom: Why my kid play drum?
* director: That's what he wanted to play, ma'am. All the boys want to play drums.
* mom: No no no that sound too competitive. He will become aggressive about instrument and not nice person.

Semi-successful presents have been: exotic tea sets, food gifts, fruit trees/plants.

She is in her 60s, likes ""cute"" things like fruit shaped marzipan and matryoshka dolls, small appliances that do one thing (yogurt maker, popsicle maker, snow cone maker, etc. yes, she has all of these items and I hesitate to purchase another - she already has a serious hoarding problem), takes lots of vitamins and supplements, and gardens.

I am going to give her a framed photo of our daughters (something she has requested) but would love other ideas. Thanks so much for your input!

They divorced over 5 years ago but still absolutely hate each other's guts. My mother has become very racist towards Chinese people/culture and this is problematic for me because my long-time girlfriend of 5 years is Chinese. They have met (more like, been in each other's presence) probably around 4 times. My GF would try and strike up a conversation but my unenthused mother barely tries to reciprocate. My mother will hardly talk to her or acknowledge her presence. She barely knows my GF and harbors ill feelings towards her because she is *Chinese* and cannot be trusted.

That being said, living at home for the past month or so has been…challenging, and I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the relationship between my parents and me. 

Apparently, during college, hanging out with your parents is the cool thing to do again. On Facebook, I see a lot of my friends posting pictures of having lunch with their parents or spending quality time with them in general, with cute hashtags like #happymothersday, #daddyslittlegirl, etc. I can’t bring myself to do this. I don’t think I’ve ever formed an emotional bond with them strong enough to do this, and I feel that I’m drifting further apart from them as I get older. I’m always a little embarrassed whenever Mother’s or Father’s Day comes around, and my friends ask me if I have anything planned for them, because frankly, I don’t. 

My dad always tries start a conversation with me, but it always turns into robotic, strained small talk. I feel that he wants to form some sort of bond or relationship with me, but after 22 years of emotional distance, threats of disowning me, and conversations turning into lectures, I don’t think this is going to work. On top of that, I get brief moments of anxiety before heading off to new places, because of the constant emphasis that there’s a good chance I may get into an accident or – even worse – die when I step out the door by myself. 

I view my mom as a slightly worst offender in that she is tedious, judgmental, and manipulative. She champions herself as an amazing parent who gives me the flexibility to choose my own direction in life (e.g. no complaints when I signed up for that IR/Econ degree), but surprise, surprise, a few moments later, selective amnesia suddenly kicks in, and she reminds me that my social science degree is worthless and that I’d better get into law school so I can have a prosperous life. If I don’t like it? Well hey, tough luck, because in the end, this is her money and she’s making the sacrifices here, so I’d better do what she says. I’m also tired of the subtly posed questions: “So, when you actually get a job, are you going to send me some money?”

I’d like nothing more than to distance myself, and maybe even cut off ties entirely, once I’m financially independent and to get out of the negative headspace that I’m put in after lengthy interactions with my parents. Even then, financial independence seems difficult, if not daunting, to me, because my parents have made a conscious effort to manage my finances, to the point of routing my income into a dependent account under their name. I realized that I’ve already picked up on some of my parent’s habits, and I’d hate to subject my potential children to the same type of parenting that I went through. 

Don’t get me wrong – I’m so grateful that my parents made many sacrifices in their daily lives to put me through college and endure my own personality flaws, but at the same time, I’m frustrated with the fact that they’re constantly holding this over my head, on top of all the other issues that I’ve mentioned (and some I haven’t). Even then, I know they won’t be around forever, and I wonder if I’ll regret not forming a loving and understanding relationship with them. For the older redditors out there who have already been through this or those of you who understand the situation that I’m describing, does it get better? How do you cope? I was always under the impression that hating one’s parents was just a teenage phase to go through, but it’s still a reality for me even now. Is this an issue of maturity?

Thanks for reading.

**tl;dr** I dislike my parents and find them to be unpleasant people, but the guilt is crushing me and this may just be an issue of immaturity. Help?

1372144560.0,11,self.AsianParentStories,1h0wwm,How I demanded respect from my Mom,hkscfreak,11,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1h0wwm/how_i_demanded_respect_from_my_mom/,"Hey guys, I'm a first generation immigrant kid raised in America and I think I successfully earned respect and independence from my parents through judicious thinking and maturity. Just want to share my thoughts and experiences on how I did it.

Now the following is probably only applicable if you're college age, or high school if you're quite mature.  At this point in life, there will be isues that are less clear cut on who's right or wrong and when you get in arguments/discussions I think there are two keys to winning or forcing a draw.  The first is to stick with solid facts and logic.  Explain why you feel your way, and give them the chance to explain their side too.  I was fortunate enough that my dad was a fairly logical and analytical man and so as long as I was calm and respectful, I could debate with my mom as long as I wanted without interference.  This brings me to my second point, STAY CALM at all costs.  You may get angry.  They may get angry and already be yelling at you, but as long as you don't yell back, they can't play the disrespectful card.  There's a few outcomes from this, and all of them are favorable to some degree.  They might convince you with their logic, no shame in admitting defeat, they do have much more experience.  Or you may convince them (win!).  Most likely though, if no one got overly emotional, it will peter out into a quiet stalemate.  Technically, in this scenario, whoever brought up the topic at hand ""loses"" since they went on the ""offensive"" so to speak, but it's only a slight victory for the defender.  The beauty is that relations should be fairly intact.  Finally, the last scenario, someone blows their top and rage levels go over 9000.  Hopefully that's not you, because if you did you lose.  Game over. Try again later.  Whoever loses it first, loses their wits and logic to emotion and whatever point they were trying to make is now lost because if an outsider is watching, they look like an idiot.  This works beautifully in public settings or family gatherings because rational observers will see you calm, cool, and collected arguing maturely with logic.  Of course, the stakes are much higher in this environment for both parties involved so I don't recommend trying this until you have a few private victories under your belt.  The whole goal here is to demonstrate your maturity in evaluating your life and coming up with good decisions and judgments, thus earning respect bit by bit.

But hkscfreak, my parents just yell at me and try to irrationally force their will, defying all logic!  Well then, here comes part 2.  Note that this will require you to have mastered the above.  You must either have solid logical ground to stand on or the topic at hand must be subjective.  In my example case, my mom decided to rail on me for getting my ears pierced (I'm a guy, THE HORROR) while on a family trip to the motherland.  She was insecure and afraid of her old friends judging me (and transitively her) from the cultural disparity and prejudices.  She had no other reasons to be ashamed of me.  This was roughly a year after I had graduated college early with a computer science degree and moved all the way across the country alone to start at a 6-figure job.  What more could Asian parents want?  You might say, but hkscfreak! I don't have that.  Well it doesn't have to be this topic (of bringing honor and success, etc.).  It just has to be equally bullet-proof.  For example, if it's on going out late with friends/dating, the most common argument is that it will ruin your grades.  You need bullet-proof grades.  You need to be blameless and show no weaknesses for this part because you're about to show them who's boss of your life.  When they blow their top and start to go on and on, just take it.  WHAT?!?! You're saying to yourself, but we're going to fight them back right? Yes, but take it.  Not like a beaten puppy though.  Stand up straight, stay calm, show no emotion.  If you have logical arguments to what they are saying, point it out, but don't force it.  You already have the logical and moral high ground (if you don't/you're unsure then start again at the top or pick a different battle) so assert your dominance and show you are confident in it.  Most importantly, MAINTAIN EYE CONTACT.  Whoever is lecturing/yelling at you, stare them down.  Do NOT look away. Show no fear.  Why should you? You know you are right.  Eventually they will run out of steam.  It might be 30 minutes. An hour. Two.  Be patient and weather the storm, but do not break eye contact first.  If the speaker changes, shift to the new one, but do not ever look down or around the room or at their feet, otherwise you admit defeat.  When they run out of steam and break eye contact first, then you have your ultimate victory.

This is/will be a long process.  I would say the second part will not happen (successfully) until you are at least late into college or out as a full adult because you need to have your shit together.  Depending on the topic(s) you're fighting over you either need to know the facts and formulate your logic (easier at a younger age) and/or have your life together (school/career/whatever).

I'm an ardent feminist, and I will personally behead any man who tries to patronize me and treat me like a six-year-old. And pedophilia, age play, and incest-play are three kinks that don't float my boat in any sense. 

But, *god*, can I just say that after today, I've lost all respect for my mother?

I'm pretty sure that most of us know that our parents have screwed us up in some way or another. After dealing with mine for the majority of my lifetime, I don't think I could recognize verbal abuse if it was wearing a neon yellow traffic cone and hitting me over the head with a puppy.^sorry puppy

I think it's pretty clear that we have different moral codes. And I think it's pretty clear that we have different values.

My mom takes it upon herself to trash-talk my dad whenever possible, and honestly, it makes me horribly uncomfortable, since when she does, it doesn't matter where you are in the house, *you can hear it*. 

Now, throughout the majority of my lifetime, my brother and I have basically tried to block all of it out, to the point where I'm not sure where bad-natured jabbing stops and verbal abuse starts. My dad isn't very helpful, since he, too, generally tries to be the bigger man ~~(lol)~~ and not react. Recently, as I've grown older and have had a chance to sort of develop my ""moral code"" so to speak, I've been talking back to her. A lot. 

~~With rather well-thought arguments, in my opinion.~~

And, well, she hates it. Because she's ""queen of this household"", ""perfect"", and ""never wrong."" Even when she's being hypocritical, and very, very wrong. You see, she's grown so used to my dad letting her have at him that she's become set in her ways in more than one. (She's not a feminist. At all. Doesn't understand that feminism is more than just suffrage. Very conservative, old-fashioned, Asian mother.)

But that's not all. She expects me and my brother to play favorites (&gt;&gt;pick her!). She always asks me who I love more, her or my father. She gets ridiculously angry when we don't side with her. It gets to the point where she basically says *""I've worked so hard to bring you into this world and raise you, you ungrateful bitch. The least you can do is pick me over your asshole father. Get out of this house and go find a new mom with your dad if you can!""* 

(most of the swears are mine, but you get the gist.) 

Any way, I feel like this is growing into a text post of Asian teenage angst, due to the fact that I cognitively recognize that, Gogdammit, I have no control over her, but instinctively want to fix her skewed world view, which may or may not be American influence. 

**TLDR** My mother acts like a child half my age and I can't stand it anymore.

I'm the youngest of two kids (we're 10 years apart in age). My sister got pretty much everything she wanted. 

She turned 16, got a car. I had to wait until I was 17 just to even get my license, and after much arguments parent finally realized I needed one because I couldn't be taken to all the things I needed to be taken to i.e. school projects, sports practices, and etc. It became too much of a hassle for my parent to even take me to places. 75% of the time I couldn't even go because I had no ride.

 She totaled her car? She got a brand new one, even went to the dealership and picked out EXACTLY what she wanted. I got a big SUV which (though i was grateful) I kept saying I'd rather want something smaller and much cheaper to fix up and save on gas. I still can barely afford the gas in the same first car. Now she's complaining saying she's wants a new car soon.

She went to college, parent though it'd be a GREAT idea to link accounts with hers. Sister went on a huge spending spree. Parent flipped saying how much her savings took a nose dive. I have no idea how much CC debt my sister is in. Did I mention she wrecked her car again and again,claiming it was ""hit and run""? Only instead of a new car we manage to fix it up.

Sister decides to take a 10 year detour from perusing her dream of becoming a doctor. Takes a few jobs here and there; she traveled all around the world during this time. **None of her money was saved.** God knows how she could afford traveling so much from all over Europe,  South America,  Asia, Australia etc.

After all her major adventures, she finally gets into medical school, coincidentally around the time I'm going to college. She needs money each money to cover her expenses. Sorry, parent can't afford to pay for me now. Sister claims it's my fault for going to a big school. I got a scholarship (ended being same price as public college) and I thought I'd fit in better there. I get 0 from parent, so I have to take out loans and work part time to help cover things here and there.

It took her 10 years to get into medical school yet she couldn't save a fucking dime of it?

My mother has pretty much nothing to do with my wedding at the moment because it's 1) two years down the road, completely understandable, and 2) I'm not sure she's ready to accept that her only daughter is getting married yet. What I don't exactly appreciate is the fact that she's constantly telling me, ""You never know what'll happen, men are unpredictable!"" and ""Why are you planning so early? You don't have a job yet and your fiance doesn't start his for another three months!"" It'd be one thing if we sat down and had a conversation about it, but her saying this repeatedly in passing is getting grating...

Yes, our financial situation is not completely set, but I don't think there's anything wrong with being responsible and looking at numbers to get an estimate as to how much this wedding might cost us.

The other thing that's rubbing me the wrong way is how she says her children are ""abandoning her"". We currently don't have the best living situation and are splitting a single family home with another family. We've taken over the basement apartment while they live upstairs. It's cheap, but it isn't glamorous. My mother apparently wasn't expecting me to try and move out of the house as fast as I can. ""Don't you think it's a little unfair that I spend all these years raising you, and the only thing you can think about is getting out of here as fast as you can? My DREAM is to move out of this basement, don't you think it'd be easier on you if we moved out into a nice apartment together and you and I split the rent? Why do you not want to help your mother? Why would you just decide to throw me away like that? Does my well-being not matter to you? You realize you're obligated to help your family, right?""

I have TWO YEARS before my wedding. I only just started planning. I don't feel like putting up with this for another three months, let alone two years.

As I've grown older, I've realized I don't really have any true hobby that I am passionate about.  Speaking to a counselor, I was asked about my upbringing and I described to her a childhood that endured a typical strict Asian parenting style  I basically grew up in a stereotypical Asian household where I played piano and violin, had after school tutors in Chinese, math, science, English, and did Tae Kwon Do.  All of which were on a rigorous schedule governed by my mother in the hopes of raising me to be a doctor.  Any deviation from the schedule resulted in punishment.  Bottom line was my life was really dictated by my mother all the way up through the end of my high school years. The one thing that I did do which was different than most Asian kids was that I joined a little league roller hockey team, which I was very good at.  But that was taken away from me after I injured myself, sustaining a cut and scar through my left eyebrow, which to my superstitious parents meant my future was going to be ""ruined.""

I also mentioned to the counselor that I realized I have no hobby. I simply work, surf the web, sleep on a daily basis. She connected the two together saying that because I was constantly managed by my mother, I had no chance of exploration and learning about myself and what I enjoyed. And now that I've grown up, I never realized any true passions that were uncovered by my youth.  Now I struggle with finding something to do on my spare time. Hockey was an option but with my work schedule I know I can't really pursue it. I hate to blame this on my parents since it really isn't their fault.

Any suggestions?",citg0,18,10,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/10hff7/hey_aps_백인_남자친구_here_her_appa_no_likey_any/,"Hey folks. First time poster here... been lurking for awhile, but found this sub and figured I'd finally make the transition. Anyways, onto the story: It's the stereotypical 'Korean girl dating white dude, while her disapproving father makes things challenging'.

My girlfriend and I have been dating since May of 2011 (and knew each other for a decent amount of time prior to that); we actually met on 4chan's pseudo-dating site (Anonidate). To keep it simple, all my chips are in on this one. I've already made my parents, my friends, -her-, and others aware that I fully intend on proposing to her within a year and a half... thus brings my concern to a boiling head.

Ever since we started dating, I've treated her like a princess. We keep each other in check, but I definitely go out of my way to make sure that she is well taken care of. I am 22, but I am living away from the parents, work a full-time/salaried job, and attend night classes 2 days a week to finish up my degrees. I'm highly motivated by her, and honestly everything I do has our future in mind.

Within a week of us 'making it official', I suggested that I meet her parents. I am a fucking gentleman [when the situation calls for it], so I wanted it to coincide with me bringing her back from dinner or something, so that I could at least look presentable. I had a basic understanding of what was ahead of me -- Koreans (Asians in general, really) are a very proud people. Simply put, I'd be viewed as clouding the genepool.

The meeting with the parents (and brother) went reasonably well, in that I wasn't chased out of the house with a baseball bat. The brother liked me because I'm a videogame nerd  -- I actually work for the company developing a new and highly-awaited MMO :) -- and could keep pace with him in being a smartass and picking on his sister. Since the meeting, the brother (and, surprisingly enough, her mother) have taken to me quite well.

In the time between then and now, I've moved an hour south (closer to my job, farther from her). This more or less makes it so that weekends are our only opportunity to see each other. When time came for this new arrangement, I wrote her parents a letter, explaining to them that I was moving away, how greatly I care for their daughter, my full intentions, and a promise that -- while it would never be to their standards -- their daughter would always be more than accommodated for. I also spelled out to them our plans for alternating weekends at each others' respective houses.

Weekend one came, she stayed over from Friday to Sunday morning, when she got a call from her omma, letting her know that her appa had asked where she was. I shrugged this off as him being forgetful of the letter, until weekend two came. Weekend two came, and I slept (in an extension of her brother's room) upstairs. Evidently, the next morning, he asked her halmoni (who surprisingly likes me) whose shoes were by the door -- referring to mine.

This pissed me off. Her dad is, as I am sure many of you are familiar with, the staunch no-bullshit Korean. My opinion of him is that [and I'm sure, upon reading this, my girlfriend will message me on Facebook and disagree] he wears polos and plays golf as routinely as he dislikes (or, at least, views as inferior) non-Koreans. What irked me the most is that, sure, I can see disregarding something from me, but the fact that he didn't even give it a glance-over for his daughter, as it was more-or-less from/concerning her, too. Evidently, following this weekend, he told my girlfriend [through her mom] that he was no longer going to interfere with our relationship, but would also never support us [I believe a reference was made to finances, in regard to the future, as well].

By mid-week following Weekend 2, I get a call after work. My girlfriend is in tears, telling me that her father told her that I 'made everyone uncomfortable' (which was not the case) and that, unless she changes her behavior (staying out late for bars, spending the night at my/her girlfriends houses...), she would no longer be welcome in the household. 180 degrees from the whole... ""not interfering"" thing. The woman is 22 years old and is being lectured/threatened for staying at friends' houses and going out to bars.

Little things hurt more than any of that, though. We [my girlfriend, her brother and myself] were planning on meeting them [the parents] at a buffet for dinner for a few days. He was, to our knowledge, aware of the plans. It wasn't until a couple of hours before that omma called my girlfriend and let her know (in Korean, which didn't matter, the emotion painted the picture for me) that if I were going to be at dinner, he would not be in attendance. This ended up with us stopping by their house to meet omma, being handed a couple of twenties, and sent off to get dinner [we picked up her brother's white girlfriend along the way -- funny enough, he's more okay with this relationship since he is a younger brother and they view this relationship, despite its long duration, as being a passing phase].

My girlfriend has two semesters left until her NCLEX for RN (then another few for BSN, then to specialize, and so on). He dangles this over her head, since she (nor myself) are financially secure enough, currently, without him. My parents would be more than willing/able to help, should it be necessary, but regardless, the whole thing is pretty sickening.

I'm 22. I have a Roth IRA, a 401(k), money market accounts, and I do a bit of freelance money-making project in my free time from my full-time job. I am wrapping up my Bachelors, then moving onto a Masters. At night. I am busting my ass off (as is she) to establish our future. I am never happier than when I am with her, and I'd like to think it is the same situation with her. I just wish that her father were capable of seeing what her mother sees -- regardless of who/what they had in mind for their daughter's future spouse, she is happy. My parents are typical whitefolk (my dad is 100% Italian, my mother is Irish/German/Polish) -- they're happy because I am happy. I wish it were the same on appa's end.

His birthday was recently, so my girlfriend and I went in halves for a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue. I decided to get him a card, as well. Evidently he said thank you (according to my girlfriend), but we aren't sure if he just assumed it was from her. I signed the card from myself (not her), but judging by his last bout of reading something, I don't want to be so sure that he was actually thanking me.

I understand cultural differences. I also understand that this shit is engrained; it's not something that their almost-20 years in the States [from Seoul, SK] will have changed. Don't get me wrong; I respect all of this. Unless this all changes soon, I will still be waiting for his approval by the time I have decided it makes sense to marry my best friend. Must I then wait for him to approve of that? What if he doesn't? My goal from the start is not to steal away his daughter, but rather, give them another son. I don't think it is headed that way, and I would hate to have him miss out on his daughter's marriage due to his unwillingness to accept our love. I just wish he were willing to meet me half-way; neither of us has done anything to expect less than that, at least.

I'm sure I've forgotten stuff, but I'm in class... typing this up between typing notes. :|

Any suggestions from anyone who has been through this, or a similar situation?

Just to clarify, I understand his point of view entirely. I would like to think that he is only being so stern because he wants the best for his daughter. I know exactly how I intend on being with my [hypothetical] daughter, so I can totally see where he is coming from.

* Dad always adds ice cubes to his already chilled beer.  Sometimes it's crushed ice, sometimes cubed ice but no matter what, there's always ice.
* Parents always put salt, black pepper, hot sauce, and soy sauce on (almost) ALL food before tasting it. Afterwards they complain about how spicy and/or salty the food tastes.

Bonus: Parents love to pick their teeth at the dining table, whether at home or as a dinner guest in someone else's home or at a restaurant. Mom even carries toothpicks with her at all times.  I guess I should be glad that they cleverly cover their mouths with their hands.

I am also posting from a mobile device.

I am currently in the summer of my second year, going into my third year, of my Doctorate in Pharmacy and the last five years have been wearing me down mentally, beginning with the Asian-Style parenting spiel. I admit that my parents are not as much of tigers compared to other people's, but rather, I feel that I am breaking from this soft onslaught of complaints from my parents.

I admit that I was not the best student. In fact, while I am currently in a PharmD program, my weakest subject is Chemistry. This summer, in fact, I was unfortunately let go by my program and I went on a search through my school for a new major, hopefully being able to salvage some credits that I have wasted in this farce of a program. That is when I spoke to the director of the Health Psychology program. She had described it as a sort of liberal arts major in the sciences, and gave me the opportunity to branch out towards many different careers such as therapy, public health education, and traditional armchair psychology. I fell in love with this major and was willing to go through the change of major process. In my excitement I voiced myself to my parents, foolishly thinking I had a choice. I was immediately told I would not make money from being a psychologist. 

Explaining to them as if they were children, I tried to drill into them that this was not psychology, but rather a different course that was also easier than my original major but still allowed me to branch into pharmacy. No dice, it was pharmacy or disowning of my person. Luckily I had submitted an appeal of their decision and due to the low margin that I had been cut from; a 2.68 rather than the minimum of a 2.7, I was allowed back in. However my parents seemed to think that it was both:

A) Their doing that I was accepted back in, not mentioning all they did was complain to me. They didn't even bother going to my school.
B) My complete laziness that I failed my classes, though the only class that held me back was organic chemistry, and I still passed the class, albeit with the good nature of the professor who took pity on me and messed with the numbers a bit so I could pass.

I am sorry for venting a bit, but I cannot take the hour long speeches every day about how I won't be able to find a wife without having a job as a pharmacist because I am dumb, fat, and ugly (their words), as well as the fact that they keep telling me I only have four more years in school, as well as the veiled threats of kicking me out if I do not pass.

I also stopped having conversations with them, as all they talk about is how much of a failure I am. My father even said it was a waste for time for me to be studying pharmacy as my younger sister was better than I was in school. To my face. During dinner. With my family, sister included. He then goes on to say it doesn't matter if my sisters, older and younger, didn't go to college because they were girls and could get rich husbands, but I am doomed to die alone if I don't graduate. 

My mother is quite worse, at least in attitude. She offers her opinion on everything possible even if it does not help at all. I cannot even try to talk to her. One instance was when I was talking about the possibility of people using geothermal sources of energy to power machines, branching on to farming. In which she says if I did not do well in school, she would sell me to slavery on a farm in china. I pretty much lost it and fumed away.

I cannot even ignore them, as they get pissed if I don't talk to them, so I am in a complete lose situation. I guess I just wanted to vent, as it gets frustrating being the child of parents who lived through the Great Mistake period in China.",,False,self,t5_2u8j6,False,,,True,t3_1jbvl8,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1jbvl8/there_is_a_difference_between_psychology_and/,

She has 6 figures of debt from graduate school.  We recently moved in together while she is doing a short-term residency while she gets paid a stipend which is basically enough to cover food and rent; not even enough to cover the interest on her debt.  Now when she visits home, her parents are putting tons of pressure on her to give them money: (1) They want a cut of her stipend.  The exact amount is some vague expectation left up to my girlfriend to stress over. (2) They want to visit us, and have my girlfriend pay for the 3 nights hotel stay for the visit, and hinted at how another relative took an elder relative out to an extremely expensive dinner during a visit.  (3) They criticize me/her for only renting and not buying a house (but this has quieted down lately).

They often hint/imply/say how she owes them so much and she's being a bad daughter, but from my perspective, the parents have given her no emotional support (or are in truth emotionally abusive) and negligible financial support since graduate school.  

As her western boyfriend (a fact I guess they're resigned to at this point), this is mind-blowing to me, and extremely frustrating to see my gf under such parental financial pressure when she has enough stress already from the debt she owes and the meager stipend.  I want to tell her to stand up to her parents and cut them off, since they've caused her nothing but grief and she has serious debt to pay for the next 10 years, but she says this is how it is in Chinese culture.

Any advice or similar experiences?

I'm a high school sophomore right now with two loving first-generation Chinese parents. They're great. I'm applauding.


I'm guessing right a lot of Asian kids have had their parents use physical discipline, to the point where it's past just spanking, or a few slaps. That's kinda what happened to me. It started when I was three and it petered off maybe one and a half years ago. I remember my dad hitting me with a ruler and all that. It wasn't abuse, necessarily (was it?) and it only manifested maybe once a month. It was never so extreme that it left any actual marks, just redness and some swelling the next day. And it really shouldn't have been such a big deal to me. My problem is that I can't get over it. I still flinch at sudden movements, and I always subconsciously lean away from my dad when he's near me. I don't like it when people touch me suddenly and I tend to overreact when I'm chased or grabbed at. It's pissing me off that it's such a big deal because my parents are cool and I shouldn't let stuff like that continue to bother me. Because now I have school to stress me out!!  


Oh I just thought of something else bear with me here. My parents signed me up for art classes when I was five because they thought it would turn me into a well-rounded, well-adjusted person and because art looks good on college apps. They didn't really expect me to take to it that much. I took art classes for nine years and I'm taking IB Art next year. I fully intend on going to an art college, or at least to a major in visual arts. It's therapeutic and great and I'm sounding kinda melodramatic here but I really don't know what I'd do without it. I'm already getting commissions and stuff and I've won a few awards, so I'm mildly successful. I want a future in the arts, but my parents don't support it at all. They're not unreasonable people. They want me to be happy and they're not insistent on jobs like lawyer, doctor, or engineer. But my dad has flat-out said that he will not pay tuition for an art college or if I decide to major in art. He says I need to spend more time studying instead of drawing, and that he won't buy supplies for me. So I guess I'm asking how I can get my parents to support me and what I want to do.

Fast forward to when I was 9 ish, my parents decided to get me to go to a weekly Chinese class to hopefully improve my Chinese skills. I hated every second of that class and every second spent doing the homework. I didn't have the least interest in learning Chinese and the class was pretty uninteresting to start with. 

I complained to my parents of course, and they would always bring up how ""oh, this family I know, the parents don't let *their* children speak any English in the house, they ignore them unless they speak Chinese, and now the children are *very good* at Chinese"" and I really didn't want that to happen to our household, if only because rebellious me didn't want their satisfaction of me having me speak Chinese. TBH they probably didn't have the energy to do that and so that's why they forced me to go to classes.

So I continued the lessons for 4 years after that, and I didn't really learn much (I traded ending the class with getting a piano grade haha). Now, in my latter years of high school, I've realized that I would quite like to learn some Chinese, and I honestly feel that if my parent's hadn't forced it on me (which gave me a deep resentment for it), I would've embraced it independently and much more readily.

Anyone else have stories about learning languages?

1375842940.0,2,self.AsianParentStories,1juuwe,Change in parental behavior.,murtaza64,3,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1juuwe/change_in_parental_behavior/,"I've been on this sub for a while and read lots of stories about how Asian parents are hardly ever proud of accomplishments and always want more, and have even read one or two about parents who are very supportive of kids and not typical asian parents.
What I haven't seen yet is a change of behavior from one to the other, so I thought I'd share my story.

BG: 13 y.o. Male, Pakistani (British born)
NB: some people consider pakistanis to be not real asians, but i consider myself to be asian because a lot of the same culture applies to me.

So we lived in Pakistan for the first 4 years of my school life. Among the other kids, I was very intelligent and one year ahead. When we moved to Uganda, I was yet again put one year further back, meaning that I was 7 years old in a class of 9 year olds.

And yet I still outpreformed most of the students. (sounds braggy, bear with me)

Now, the first wave of report cards came around, and none of us had any clue of how it worked. This was an IB school; the grades were acronyms such as E[exceeds expectations], M[meets expectations] and RA[requires assistance]. The only difference was, M was equivalent to a B, even though it was the middle of the spectrum. My parents were infuriated when my report card showed up with 6 fucking Ms on a report full of Es. Anyway, this continued for a good two years till i finally made it to middle school.

Here the grading system was different yet again: a number scale from 1-7, 7 being the best. (7 = A+, 6 = A/A-, 5= B/B+ etc)
They had this thing called honor roll where if you got an average of 6, with no score below 5 in any subject, you would be given a certificate in front of the school. Each semester I barely missed this, and each time for a two week period my parents were pissed at me.

Once, it was reported by one of my teachers that I forgot to do my HW. my mom took a slipper and smacked me twice, once on the face. Bear in mind that my parents were actually quite well educated, my dad was in telco and my mom was a teacher. 

Finally I achieved honor roll in my 4th and final semester, and my parents were actually happy for once. But it didn't last long either, because we were moving again (to Dubai).

So, obviously, my mom applied me to the best school here, and upon finding out it had an entrance exam, my whole summer was spent revising for it. Content that never came up on the fucking test (seriously the hardest question was ""what is 16 squared"")

I was also put back with my age group.

During my first year here, things weren't very different. While there was no corporal punishment, games, laptop etc were confiscated regularly, and lectures were given in the car almost every other day. I got very, very good reports in the first year (but didn't get any awards, so naturally the first question was ""why no awards"") and at the end of the year my parents seemed happy.

Then next academic year was very different now. Hardly was there any form of yelling, never was there corporal punishment, for the first half of the year there were a few lectures but by the end hardly any. And my parents were open to career choices and happy with my achievements.

The last year ended very well, after recovering from appendicitis I did even better than last year on the exams, and my parents were happy.

I can attribute this sudden change in parenting to two things:
1. Being open minded, looking at other forms of parenting, simply because of me complaining.
2. (idk if its true) Being influenced by the western cultures of the city and their friends.

In the end, just goes to show that parents can change and they are not perfect either.

**TL;DR: parents used to yell, lecture, hit, now they don't.**

In my family, all fashion was dumb. But the epitome was L.A. Gear. We're talking:

* ""Their family must be rich, they waste money on L.A. Gear""
* ""Their junk daughter only want to wear L.A. Gear""
* ""How about next year no school supply instead buy L.A. Gear for you""

I didn't like L.A. Gear and never once asked for it, lol.

Although this pales in comparison to the time a family friend asked his parents for Skidz.

I [25f] want to move in with my white [27m] boyfriend but I feel guilty about not telling my Asian parents. My parents are very traditional, strict Asian parents. Boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year, both of us are financially independent. I spend almost all my time at his place (my mom sort of knows this already) and we want to take the next step in our relationship, so moving in together is an idea we both agreed on. My parents live out of the country, so it is unlikely they will find out, but I feel guilty about lying to them about moving in with my boyfriend. They also think marriage is still a number of years away for me, which is true, both of us are not ready for that yet. He has met my parents once, and while they like him, they do not consider it serious (i.e. marriage) as it has only been a year. I suspect they hope I might move on from this relationship in a year or two to one with a nice Asian boy and move back closer to home. They also emphasize ""a good marriage will now determine my future happiness.""

They have always told me they prefer the truth, so I feel like I would rather come clean and tell them (or at least my mother, who is a little more understanding of my Western ways) that I've moved in with my boyfriend. I don't want to tell them before I move because they will guilt trip me HARD like Asian parents do. However, I also don't want to deal with the drama and am considering lying to them for another year, but I really would rather not lie. My parents know that when they criticize me I shut down and get angry over their control (""we just want what's best for you"") and in recent years they have been a little more understanding. I've already heard the whole ""you will be disowned"" lecture but I've never crossed that yet. This would be the biggest thing I've done to cross them. 

 Should I lie to them outright and save them (and us) the drama, should I go about this slowly, or should I come clean? I would like advice from those who have dealt with this before.

How meddling can your relatives get, how do you feel about their meddling, and how do you deal with it?

Mine are the type that seem to think they should have a say in pretty much all my decisions (even minor ones), just because they were raised to be too attached to one another. For instance, they can't seem to take the hint that, while I am religious, I'm mostly non-practicing. They keep trying to invite me to church, even going so far as to tell me that Christians are better people than non-believers/people of other faiths (judging by their behavior, totally not true :p). They also keep telling me what kind of SO I should be with, as if they're the ones who will be in a relationship and not me. In a previous post, I've talked about how my parents are giving me hell for having a non-Chinese SO, but it gets more complicated because, if my extremely conservative relatives were to find out, they'd throw a fit for sure, and use all the manipulation and pressure tactics my parents have used (or maybe even worse).

I love the idea of Asian parties: a ton of great, home-made Asian food. What could go wrong with that? But I've found that over the years, I end up throwing out half of my plate. And I think I've found out the reason for that.

Not only is there a ton of food, so all the flavors get blended together, by the time everyone starts eating the food is COLD. The food might be good if it were served family style, but it was never meant to be served at the temperature is is. Which is pretty upsetting on my part, because I hate seeing so much good food go to waste. 

Now if only people could invest in a couple of banquet heaters. But we all know Asian parents are too cheap for that, right? :)",,False,self,t5_2u8j6,False,,,True,t3_1htjal,http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1htjal/my_gripe_with_asian_parties/,
