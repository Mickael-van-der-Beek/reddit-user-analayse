Post all your prank Ideas here, and I will edit them into this post. So we have a nice, accessible collection of pranks on the top!

I'll start with a few i stumbled upon so far, or of which I know of.

* Take a plate, pee in it and put it in the freezer. When it's frozen, remove the pee-disc from the plate. Now slide it under your victim's door (works best if they lock their door, for example in dorms). 
Victim wakes up with a puddle of pee in his room, checks the door, then starts silently crying, because he thinks he's becoming insane.

* Saran wrap the door/toilet seat/car/cubicle. Saran wrap everything!
* If someone is a heavy sleeper, sew their shirt onto the blanket while they sleep.
* Sew the arms of a pullover closed.
* Slighlty unscrew salt shaker.
* Fill cereals from the plastic bag directly into the cardboard container and open the bottom lid. Then place back in shelf.
* Pour glitter or confetti into air vent in car.
* Throw cress seeds into car, then water it (just a bit. And I don't recommend this, unless you really hate the person, because that shit is forever) Works also for carpets, flats, keyboards, everywhere where the seeds might fit into.
* Superglue stuff to surfaces (pens, shoes, whatever you can find)
* Tape air horn to a wall behind a door, so the opening door hits the button.
* Tape air horn under desk chair (The ones where you can adjust the height)
* Tape balloons next to a door, then tape thumbtacks to the door, so they pop the ballons while opening.
* Slightly open the confetti compartment of the victim's perforator.
*Take mentos, drill hole in it, take a twine, and put it into a bottle of coke, so the mentos is hidden in the cap. Cut remaining twine, let victim open the bottle. Coke fountain in his face.
* Rub chillies onto bathroom door handle (Caution, this is evil)
* Put icy hot, or similar into shower head (Also, very evil)
* Put vaseline covered boullione cubes into shower head (time delay)
* Put the color shit with which you paint easter eggs into shower head, also covered in vaseline for time delay.
* Plug wireless mouse into victim's computer
* Register their email at various single meeting sites (gay or straight)
* Staple cups together, fill them with water, place them everywhere.
* Tell victim to place both his index fingers onto table, then place full glas of water on top of it. Get up and leave.
* Mouse traps
* Fluorescent paint, write creepy messages on wall.
* Replace water with vodka.




* Sell your friends iphone on gumtree with their contact details.
* THE TRIPLE THREAT.
   * The upper deck. Remove lid from back of toilet. Shit in tank
   * The lily pad. Fill regular spot with entire unrolled roll of t.p. shit on top.
   * The water log. Soak the full roll of t.p. on the holder with piss.


If you accomplished all three. they will have to move. Very difficult to clean.

* Stand on a chair with a bowl of water on the ceiling, get a broom, and hold it up with the broom. Then, find a friend, ask them to hold it for a minute while you get something, and take the chair, they'll be stuck for a while, unless they want a wet head

* Put your friends' phone numbers on a sheet of paper with a message like
For a good time, call 555-555-555
Fit as many onto one sheet of paper as you can (like 2 columns, 20 rows - 40 messages per page) and cut them out. Drop / hand them out in populated areas (hallways, malls, trains, etc).
* Replace mouthwash with vodka + food coloring
* Replace deoderant with cream cheese
* Go to party &gt; Choose victim &gt; Challenge to rum shots &gt; Take one normal shot &gt; Pour Ipecac in their 2nd shot glass &gt; Run for cover
* Set someone's background to a blue screen of death, hide the icons and start bar
Alternatively or in addition to - turn their screen sideways or upside down.
* Send abortion / birth control / teen pregnancy / family planning notices or coupons to a girl friend's address where they live with their parents.
You can leave the name vague so the parents open the mail but then realize it's for the daughter.
* Fold ketchup packets and place them underneath the toilet seat (the past you'd sit on).
Have the crease (the folded part, not the 2 ends) sticking out towards the person's legs. When they sit, the packet will explode at the crease and coat their legs with ketchup.
* Send abortion / birth control / teen pregnancy / family planning notices or coupons to a girl friend's address where they live with their parents.
You can leave the name vague so the parents open the mail but then realize it's for the daughter.",,False,self,t5_2qmc4,1347312379.0,,,True,t3_yuld5,http://www.reddit.com/r/pranks/comments/yuld5/prank_collection_thread/,

Worked in the control centre, monitoring camera and alarm systems for municipal buildings across the entire city.  One of my supervisors at the time was quite openly homophobic.  Nice enough guy for the most part, but VERY ""pure laine"" Quebecois [basically a traditional white French-Canadian bigot/racist), so not shy about grumbling about ""les maudits tapettes"" [translation: ""those fucking fags""] whenever the subject came up somehow...

So one day, as a joke, my coworker dared me to call up this supervisor's voicemail and leave a highly suggestive message for him in my best stereotypically gay voice (I'm a pretty decent impressionist, especially that one in particular - had done it before, to uproariously funny effect...) 
 
Didn't even hesitate... Totally did it right then &amp; there. In my most fabulous of French!  Something to effect of ""Hi, my little spice muffin!  Had a great time last night!  Call me! Etc. etc. etc."" ;-D
Stayed a few extra minutes after my shift ended, just to see this supervisor's reaction when he checked his messages...  Here's the best part: he had it on speakerphone when he did!!! Reaction was PRICELESS!!!!!  His eyes widened, his ears turned bright red, a look of utter confusion/abject horror spread across his face... He practically stabbed the disconnect button after about 10-15 seconds, muttering a distinctly colourful stream of profanities... 

Needless to say, the rest of us in the office - all within earshot - were in absolute hysterics!  We all had a good, hearty, minute-long belly laugh :-)",,False,self,t5_2qmc4,False,,,True,t3_zrms3,http://www.reddit.com/r/pranks/comments/zrms3/i_once_played_a_hilariously_apt_beautifully/,

    ME:  ""Does it smell funny in here to you?""

    ME: ""It kind of smells like updog in here...""
    HIM: ""Huh? What's updog?

It took him another 5 minutes to realize that I was playing a joke on him. Coworker #2 even said he probably would have fallen for it.

So, about a week after my medical, I get a phone call from a blocked number. This is how the conversation went. I've omitted the company name and phone numbers.

Man on phone: Hi, it's John from [Insert company name here]. How are you today?

Me: Good. How are you?

John: Yeah good, mate. Hey, I was just ringing up to let you know that you've got the job!

Me: Really?

John: Yeah. How does that sound?

Me: Great! Um, is there a number I can contact you on this afternoon to talk more in detail? I'm at work at the moment.

John: Of course. Have you got a pen?

Me: Yep.

John: Ok, it's **...

Me: Yep.

John: **...

Me: Yep.

John: **...

Me: Yep. [Thinking: Hang on, this is looking like a local number...]

John: **...

Me: [Realised its a number from the factory I work at and I now recognise the voice.] Fuck off, Mick!

I hang up.

I've been stressing about getting a phone call from this company so hard because it will be mean a big lifestyle change for me and my family. For a few moments, a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders.

Now I need your help. I have very little imagination, but I have access to a lot of equipment. I am an electrician at an abattoir and have access to all areas including a store room. I can go into the factory after hours and no questions will be asked because I do 24 hour a day repairs.

I really need to get this guy back. Thank you.

I'm currently studying at the University of Wolverhampton. A good friend of mine and current house mate is stuck in the ""frape-ing"" phase.
Its pretty intense. You don't have to leave the room to find yourself turning round to see a giant cock representation of yourself on your facebook page. Or a mass email sent out to 3 generations of family members proclaiming your new found sexuality. This has been on-going for the majority of our final year and me and a few others realised, that despite the occasional salt in tea moment the tables are pretty in-balanced. So! Tonight, we decided to get to work. 

The target. A blog. 
He started a couple of years back. Documenting his travels prior to university. Particularly his adventures to the south of almost every woman he supposedly encountered whilst there. Which is common knowledge to anyone who stumbles upon the dark, hypo-sexual confines of his ""Confessions of a 21st century male"" blog page.
Last time he mentioned it, i think he had a couple of hundred views. Which is worrying. But not why i am here.
I call upon you redditors. People so mystical he has no idea you exist. Which is fortunate. To aid us by simply reading a couple of the posts we have made. Failing that, you can always see the pictures he uploaded himself onto his blog to get an idea of the type of guy we are dealing with here. The aim of all of this?

Well. To be honest we spent about 2 hours on it. Then thought, shit. Its just not funny unless we can pull in more views in a night than he has in 2 years.

Ultimate snipe hunt reversal - tomorrow night deadline!,burgledturds,4,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/pranks/comments/qfcii/need_help_ultimate_snipe_hunt_reversal_tomorrow/,"A co-worker approached my friend and I and explained that another co-worker is going to take her snipe hunting tomorrow.  My friend informed her that snipe hunting is a very old prank.  Immediately, I realized that we had the stage set for the ultimate snipe hunt reversal prank.  See, she expressed genuine enthusiasm when he initially told her about it.  She's still playing along, but he has no idea she knows what's going on.  Also, she has good reason to believe that another co-worker will be filming her snipe hunt.  I've been asking around, but I haven't found a good enough prank, yet.

We told my boss and he suggested that she bolt once they leave her (that's gonna happen, right?) and make them worry about her.  I like the sentiment, but I don't know if it is devious enough.  Anyway, bottom-line is we gotta make them think their prank went horribly wrong.

Here's the deal:
I know the general area (but pinpointing exactly where to be will be pretty difficult).  We know she is bringing her own pillowcase (she could preload it with something).  We don't know exactly how this will play out (is he gonna ditch her? film her trying to catch a snipe with a pillowcase and flashlight?).  We definitely believe it will be filmed by other people.

I could contact the co-worker and tell him I want in (he's just about said as much).  I could contact the filming co-worker and let him know the score (though, I kinda wanna bust him for being in on it).

I work at a large company, and on site we have three different buildings where people work. The guy pranking me is a colleague of a friend of mine, in another team. They started to notice some weeks ago that the telephone of a departed colleague of theirs is still connected, but that his name has been removed from the directory. So when they call with said phone, the callee sees a standard number, and it looks a *lot* like one of the tech-support teams number.

What they did is call me with the phone and say they were from the Internet security team, and they noticed unusual activity with my account. The guy said there were some heavy use of some websites and that I had signed a paper upon being employed here that defined some guidelines on the use of the web at work. They wanted me to make sure I understood these guidelines, that most unprofessional websites were blocked by the proxy but that some others were not, but still categorized as risky. This was like a first warning, no-big-deal-there kind of thing, and they couldn't really disclose the infringing sites, but they wanted me to come by and reread the agreement with them.

Then the pranker (who had me all along, despite me wondering why they couldn't tell me which sites exactly I wasn't supposed to visit) gave me an office floor and number, and told me to ask for Mr Boubacar, then hung up.

That's how I went to an office of four unsuspecting guys asking for Boubacar, a man of whom they never had heard of. The lady there tried to help me by looking him up in the directory (""probably the wrong floor here let me check... Mmh no only boubacar is in another city :("") while his colleague, upon hearing me stating the office number again said ""YEAH it's me !! No I'm jocking it's not me, but it's the correct office you got... still no boubacar."" then proceeded to look under his desk and under piles of paper asking out loud ""boubacar? boubacar?"" &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

Then on my way out, I stumble upon the guy that called me, and I recognize him and say ""oh hey! they called you too? Looks like they gave the wrong floor to everybody""...  He tells me it's alright he knows where to go... then leads me to my friend and another colleague, all laughing out loud and waiting to let me in on the joke.


This was a pretty good joke, and I fell for it all the way. Now I'm on the lookout for some awesome ideas to return them the favor. I cannot use the phone trick back at them obviously. Any idea reddit?

**tl;dr** guy calls me from an official-looking internal number and makes me go to another building asking for someone that doesn't exist, and the people there make fun of me until I stumble upon the prankster and learn what this really was. any comeback?

We recorded our own message for customers to hear. I almost pissed myself laughing in one of the aisles when an obese uppity office woman waddled up to it and listened not once, but TWICE, to our recording of ""Heeeey shit for brains!

And me and this guy did a prank we think is harmless. We bought a spray called Liquid Ass Spray. Basicly it smells like cow shit. The smell is gone after 10-15 minutes after it's sprayed and even if it is sprayed on clothes, the smell is gone after this time period (We tried).

Anywho, 1 of the girls were having a friend over on saturday, and the second girl was away for the evening. So we sprayed this smell on the walls and the door to the livingroom while they were in the girls bedroom. They came out and smelled the smell, and asked if someone stepped in dog shit or something, we said no of course and kept  quite. We continued to spray this spray while they were figuring out where it came from. We sprayed it in the sink on the livingroom (yes, we have a sink in the livingroom. No, I don't know why) and they figured out that it had to come from there, from the sewer or something. And then they went to her room and invited us in. We figured out we could spray a little in her sink too, since it's connected to the one in the livingroom, so we did, while she was in the room. She then got mad because the smell was in her room too. So they went back to the livingroom, in hope that the smell was gone, but it wasn't, because we kept on spraying. We did this for maybe two hours until we got bored with it. She sent a text message to the landlord telling that there is a weird smell, and the landlord said that we should put some disinfectant in the sink, so we did. We know our landlord, he doesn't care much and has probably allready forgot about it. And he would understand this prank, he would not get mad at all.

Anywho, on Monday, we figured out we tell them about the prank. And she totally flipped out. That it was way to mean and that they destroyed her saturday evening completaly, even though we still played cards and talked about random stuff and drank wine. And the second girl, who wasn't even there says that we entered her room without her permission and sprayed in her room because it smelled like shit in there, but we never were in her room. We never go into someone elses room without permission. So now, even though she wasn't there, she flipped even more than the girl that was actually there. 

Is this a way to mean prank, or is it harmless?

So here's the deal. my two brothers and i just moved into an awesome new house out of a crappy apartment. weve been here about a week, and we've been making jokes frequently about how we think the house is haunted, due to it being built in the 40's.  

so ive decided im going to prank my younger brother, who thought it would be awesome to live in the basement bedroom. he has a central air vent running through the middle of his bedroom. i plan to unscrew a latch in the vent, where ill place a walkie talkie. on my end, ill play subtly quiet and creepy noises that ill find on you tube. ill start this a few minutes after hes gone to bed. i want this to be a convincing prank, which is why im going to try and make it last three days, each day getting more creepy and scary.

 i need to be able to know if and or when hes heard the noises, so i can stop or start again when necessary. this is where you come in, i need ideas or tips on how to do this. the talkie is a start, but it will take more to convince his non-believing ass. any place you might know where i might get cheap audio or video surveillance equipment would be a big help, and just ideas in general. my budget is around $200. if its a success, ill will most definitely put what i catch up on the you tube.

thanks in advance!

Usually, the Seniors have filled the classrooms with balloons or just put a lock on the front door or something like that  Then they get drunk and sing bad karaoke. So here's the plan: You spread a rumor to all lower classes that the prank is going to be on a certain date, and it will involve horrible stuff, like throwing pigblood on everyone that shows up or shooting everyone with paint guns. 

Most people will not show up, but here's the trick: the teachers don't know about the rumor, and half the school will get in trouble for skipping class. Then, the next day, you can do whatever you want and do the actual prank, to which everyone will come, because they don't want to skip class again.
