For example, having to implement my own chess game with its own AI as a project for a class in college really made me value the importance of algorithmic efficiency, abstraction, and use of appropriate data types.  

Another such project was having to build a web server. Sure I had read about how HTTP works and thought I had a pretty good understanding of how the web works, but it wasn't until I had to build my own web server (though it was only a rather minimal one) that I truly appreciated everything that goes behind the scene every time I click on a link.  

As such, as I continue on my quest of both strengthening and diversifying my knowledge in the field of Computer Science, I am looking for other such projects that will either challenge my skills, teach me something new (for example something that implements a protocol or technology that I don't know very well), or help me solidify different computer science concepts.  

Below is a list of projects that I feel meet the criteria described above that I have attempted in the past (I'll update the list if I think of new ones):  

* chat server and client that supports multiple chatrooms, smileys, formatting, etc (chatting systems are part of a lot of social networks and video games, I thought it would be worth bettering my understanding of how they work, and the experience was very rewarding)
* 2D, multi-level video game (definitely made me appreciate all the hard work that goes into video games and is something I want play around with again in the future)
* basic web crawler (I wanted to better my understanding of how search engines work)
* conway's game of life (lots of fun playing around with algorithmic efficiency)
* RESTful service (implemented a RESTful URL-shortening service over HTTP)
* authorship attribution software (this was the doctoral dissertation of one my java professors, so he made us implement our own version of it, it was tons of fun and very different than most things I've programmed)

What do you guys think other some such projects might be? I'm thinking of revisiting some of the ones above in order to add more features/improve my implementation, but I'd also like new ideas of things to mess around with in the future.

I know trackerless torrents rely on magnet links, DHT and PEX.

From my understanding:

The magnet link contains a hash of the .torrents data, which a client uses to query a distributed network to find peers (DHT). The client then connects to a peer and downloads the other information that would be in the .torrent. Then it begins to download from the peers found through DHT. Then the client requests the addresses of more peers from the ones it has already connected to (PEX). And simply proceeds as if it were connected to a standard tracker.

Let me give some very basic background:


BACKGROUND:  Many traditional cryptosystems are built so that to ""break"" the system, one has to be able to solve a problem called the ""Discrete Logarithm Problem""  Conversely, to break an ECC system, one has to be able to solve the ""Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem.""  One of the reasons ECC is useful, according to every book I read, is because there are subexponential algorithms which solve the regular Discrete Logarithm Problem, but the best current algorithm to solve the ECDLP runs in O(sqrt(n)) - this is supposedly indicating the ECC system is harder to break. 


 Every single book I read seems to say this but this is really confusing me.  What's so bad about an O(sqrt(n)) time solution?  I guess I'm confused because back in my original programming class, a lot of the search algorithms and just regular algorithms we learned would be O(n^2).  I remember how an O(n) linear solution always seemed like a great solution.  Isn't O(sqrt(n)) even better?  Also, how is O(sqrt(n)) NOT a subexponential solution?


Example quote from book: Elliptic Curves in Cryptography by Blake, p.80: (talking about algorithms to ""break"" ECC systems): ""The last two attacks listed are quite general  but have complexities on the order of sqrt(n).  They become infeasible when the curve order is sufficiently large.""  


another quote:
""The main reason why (ECC) is ""more trusted"".... is because (the discrete logarithm problem)... can be solved in subexponential time with index calculus algorithms. Until recently... the time required to solve (an ECC system) was believed to be exponential in the size of the parameters.""",,False,,t5_2shke,False,,,True,t3_1bn47s,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/1bn47s/is_an_osqrtn_solution_really_that_bad/,

Some background material and links so we can all be on the same page. (Flebron, good note--I just spent most of the last 3 days trying to educate myself on the problem. I still haven't perfected technique for instant world-wide global telepathy.)


Here's a **[Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem#Formal_definitions_for_P_and_NP)** to the formal definitions of P &amp; NP I've been looking at.


My understanding so far of NP--please correct to 100% if you know better:
NP is a description of algorithms that do not run in polynomial time, which means they can be unbearably slow, but can be verified in polynomial time, which means you can check the answer quickly. An example of an NP algorithm that I stole from somewhere then trampled, would be


Given a set of numbers {-16, 6, 27, -9, 2, 22, -17, 11} select a subset that adds up to 0. 


While it's easy to verify that -16 + -8 + 2 + 22 = 0, it's harder to find them in the first place. 

Another example is that it's easy to multiply two prime numbers together, but given the resulting quotient, difficult to figure out those original two prime numbers. This second example is what public key encryption is based on.


The question researchers have been trying to figure out for the last 40+ years is whether this NP class of algorithms, where the answers look so easy after you have them, is equal to another class of algorithm, called P; P includes the set of algorithms that a computer can answer in polynomial time.


Researchers define these algorithms in such a way that one specific question can be transformed into another. Making it that if someone can prove P = NP, all NP problems could be solved like the 'easy' P problems.


If P = NP, then public key encryption can be reverse engineered without a brute force search, but that would be extra-small beans compared to the full impact of this proof. Think polynomial-time leverage to Star-Trekesque technology and beyond. Because of the scope of the bonanza if they are equal, and the incredibly hard time that the computer and math guys have had trying to prove it one way or the other, most researchers have suspicions that P does not equal NP.

A definition of NP:

NP is made of three components according to the definition at the Wikipedia 
**[Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem#Formal_definitions_for_P_and_NP)** I found.

x: a non-deterministic (slow) Turing machine that can answer cool questions.

y: a P-style Turing machine that can answer simpler questions quickly.

R: a relation R(x,y) between x and y, that provides a link between them. This R can be determined in polynomial time as well. It looks like a second P-style Turing machine.

x and y have a member set 'Epsilon' and it's functions '\*' with the same membership. R has a member set equal to the square of the size of x's membership.

y, and possibly R, are subject to big-O notation running time limitations. Big-O means that a certain function can be translated into a polynomial-style question, i.e. n*z^2 + n*z + n, except increased in the number of exponent pieces x^4, x^5, .... x^n, based on the complexity of the input.


I see different ways to interpret NP.

1. If I create an index between of all the relations between the questions and my inputs--R(x,y), I can simulate the effects of the really hard problem-cruncher *x*, quickly, with my uber-index.


2. Epsilon^\* is a count of the variables &amp; operations given to the Turing machine, so if given 1 point, I can simulate a horizontal line, with two points a slope, then three points a curve, and so on. So the hardest a question could get is equivalent to a polynomial up to exponent n, where n is the count of variables given.


I have figured out that at the very least, P is a sub-set of NP, and that in any case where x=y in P, P=NP, because it makes the whole relation between them **easy**. This only proves one special case, not the whole question.

...

...
So here are the questions from my original post:


I'm trying to better understand in the definition of the Computational Complexity class NP

1. It defines x and y are members of the finite set 'Epsilon' and its associated functions. 
I can interpret it in two ways--one as the range of the value input i.e. 1-100, the other as the count of the variables given to the Turing machine. Can someone help clarify what Epsilon is here? I'm leaning towards interpreting it as the # of input variables corresponding to the number of variables in a polynomial (hence why big O reference).


2. R is defined as a pairing relationship between x,y R(x,y) and runs in polynomial time--I interpret this as a Turing machine or index. Is this correct?


3. I can interpret R as a full indexing of the relationships between x,y--can I look at Epsilon as a definition of the concept search space, or just nouns and verbs of the operating language?


4.  Does R map a y that replicates x, or does R transform y to x? If the latter, why do we need y in the first place?


5.  Would it be practical to manipulate the terms algebraically, or does that somehow trash the set theory language?


6. R and y are subject to big O--does that make them analogues of the computational class P by themselves?

Another example: I also saw that in Windows Phones, when users were uninstalling programs, they noticed that the memory still stayed the same. When installing a new application (after uninstalling another one), the amount of memory taken didn't increase very much. Some programming-savvy users hinted at memory still existing but not being removed like I tried explaining in the first example.

In an attempt to stop laziness at my apartment, we're getting a gigantic whiteboard and will be keeping points to punish/reward those who do/don't contribute to the household.

The point game works as follows, simple tasks earn points.  At the end of the month, your points (user) are tabulated and compared to the total points of the house (total).

The points are used to offset the user's contribution to utilities.  High points =&gt; low utilities; Low points =&gt; high utilities.

Example:
the house accrues 300 points in the month.
the user generated 60 of those points.
utilities cost $500 for the month.

What formula could be used (with these inputs) that would reward a high point value with low utilities?

For the above example, a user with 300 points would pay nothing (because they did all of the housework for the month).  The total of all users' contributions must total $500.

I'm currently a scientific initiation scolarship holder under the supervision of this professor, whom I shall refer to as Bob. I should start by stating my area of research, but one of the problems is precisely that I don't have one. 

The people in my research group study agent-based modelling, social computing, etc., and I have experimented with those things a little (and written a paper about it), but I never have any idea of what I'm going to do next, as Bob is always suggesting very different areas of research that he himself doesn't know with much detail. When I follow his suggestions and work within this areas, he ignores my work completely, adding very shallow comments about what I've done everytime we talk and - what is most irritating - **forgetting everything** 2 days later.

I'm expecting you'll try to persuade me to accept the fact that *guiding teachers not guiding their students* is the general rule in an university environment. The fact is I actually accept that. I would have no problems with a useless guiding teacher that simply didn't help me at all. That would be fine. My case, nevertheless, is very different. I'm forced to work with this teacher who makes me meet with him 2 times a week to these 2~3h meetings where I'm asked to explain my research to him while he plays with his laptop, not paying **any** attention. And, what is worse than the humilliation, I'm asked to repeat over and over again the same thing, because although he is frequently stating that he understands perfectly what I'm saying, he asks me to repeat everything 10 times.

What really bothers me, though, is the fact that I bring my papers to him and I'm forced to watch as he destroys them, changing names, erasing fundamentally important parts of the text and, in short, changing everything he doesn't find aesthetically pleasing. His sense of aesthetics is **much** stronger than his scientific values, and as a result he modifies my papers to **lie** about my experiments, regarding them as much more successful than they really were.

Finally, when I try and reason with him, the discussion is something like this:

* Me: I just think that if we do things this way, th...
* Bob: You're wrong. I'm sorry to have to say that, but you're wrong.
* Me: But you didn't listen to what I had to say.
* Bob: Yeah, but I know what you would say and you would be wrong.
* Me: What is that that I would say?
* Bob: Doesn't matter. Let's do things the way I suggested, ok?

I know some of the problems can be easy. For example, we have Synamtic Endpoint Protection offered for free by the University, so a lot of users have it. Sometimes, when updated, it can cause blue screens, and that can be easily seen when the blue screen error shows that it was caused by that specific synamtic driver. So safe mode &gt; uninstall, and the problem is fixed.

Other times, it's some generic error caused by a system file, such as ntoskrnl.exe, and that usually means we have to test everything (hard drive, RAM, scan for viruses, etc.)

Is this for a specific reason? Why can't someone make it so they're easier to tell what's wrong?

1347077745.0,8,self.AskComputerScience,zjjod,Questions about post-college job prospects as a CompSci major.,qaruxj,9,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/zjjod/questions_about_postcollege_job_prospects_as_a/,"**tl;dr:** Are the claims of a massive shortage of CompSci majors true, and if so are the available jobs going to be mostly good or mostly bad? Finally, will the salaries still be as good, or will they somehow decrease and become more comparable with other STEM degrees?

I've seen a few articles talking about how there's going to be some huge shortage of Computer Science majors in the US come 2016 (which is about the time I'll be graduating), which obviously seems like good news insofar as it means I should definitely have a job. However, I have a couple of questions about that.

First, as context, I'm taking on *a lot* of debt to go to college. My family is quite poor and so I'm basically taking the maximum amount of loans I can get, since my university doesn't like to give scholarships to freshmen. Later, I expect this to subside since I'll be getting a job, hopefully scholarships, and will also be required to do a couple of paid internships my senior year that will pay $40,000, which obviously should help me out quite a lot, but I'm nonetheless worried about the prospect of having tens of thousands in loans, much of them accumulating debt over the 4+ years (my department says that, due to their internships, the average graduation time is actually four years and a term, and since I'm not some kind of crazy amazing student, I expect that I will probably do at least that).

Right now, I'm really excited for CompSci, but I know that a lot of people do change their majors and end up pursuing something completely different from what they started out with. I really don't think I could bring myself to major in something like English or History, having seen what's happening to all these people who've graduated with way better and more specific degrees and still failed to find a job, but I want to know how accurate these shortage claims are. Employment opportunities are not my only concern, because I do want to major in something that interests me, but when I see these claims that other Engineering degrees aren't experiencing much of a shortage while Computer Science majors are looking at crazy opportunities in four years' time, it really makes me want to stick with CompSci at all costs, just so I know I can have a good job that pays decent money.

Getting to actual questions:

First, are these claims even true at face value? I've seen a number of articles claiming flat out that this is a myth and that demand for CompSci majors is being greatly overstated. Some of them seemed rather dubious to me, but I feel like that might just be me being biased after having heard about there being a shortage of millions of CompSci majors and demand so high that salaries will be ridiculously good compared to the national average, which obviously sounds really appealing and too good to be true, but also would be so beneficial to me in terms of job opportunities and salary that it's hard for me to really weigh it equally.

Related to that, are there any ""gotchas"" that could turn this from true to not true really quickly? I read one article saying the response to the shortage should be decreased immigration restrictions, but I don't know to what extent that would change things. Is there anything with a reasonable chance of happening (so not an asteroid strike or WWIII) that would drastically alter my job prospects that I should be aware of?

Second, what are these jobs actually going to be like? I'm really interested in software engineering/development and databases, but I'm kind of worried that most of these jobs will be glorified IT jobs or something that won't really be what I'm interested in. I'm assuming the huge glut of jobs would have enough diversity that it wouldn't be a problem, but if it's a million small business owners who want me to set up their network for them and build a custom Access database to track their orders in, I'm probably not going to be very happy.

Third, I know software engineer salaries are really good right now, but is this expected to stay the same? I assume the increased demand would mean higher salaries all around, but if it's the small businesses I mentioned or something like that, I could see them going down because they're mostly intended to replace whatever the owner or their kid threw together and not increased demand in the same way that every major company needing a lot more software developers would be. I guess this is a largely irrational concern, but the reason I bring it up is, if I would end up making a similar salary to any of the other jobs that might interest me, I would not be quite as attached to CompSci as I am now.

3a is some integer, call it i, since integers are closed under..

I think it's ridiculous that what I did is logically incorrect, but my professor has told me that you can only set a value of something like 'i' once, and when I call it an integer I have to establish its value too. She says that it's not exactly programming and I can't do that.

could someone dispel or confirm this thought, or as a third option: completely ignore it due to its overly philosophic posturing.

I want to go to grad school next fall (Fall 2013) but the more I think about it, the worse I feel. I would really like to have an opportunity to learn but I am not sure if I am ready for graduate school. (I don't think I could even get in to be honest.) 

What should I do? I really doubt I could do well in a GRE subject test, much less rank in the 90th percentile (at least not yet, I am studying but chances are dim) as UT-Austin seems to require for out of major students. I am open to applying to any decent grad school in the US or Canada that would accept me. 

My major GPA (math) is low (3.40) because I have a lot of B's (more B's than A's as you can tell). I have all A's in my minor (Information Systems) and my overall GPA is 3.66. Part of the reason for the low GPA was because I was trying to read up on cs stuff on the side and didnt' get homework turned in on time. I worked part-time but I am not going to be a cry baby about it. It was not like didn't have any time to do homework. In retrospect, I was probably just spreading myself to thin. 

I guess you would ask what I would do with a graduate degree. It sounds cliche but I genuinely want to learn. I have no dreams of being rich or famous (not from writing code at least) but I do want to be a part of (Is it a no-no to think of computer science as a part of mathematics?) this community and maybe some day contribute in my own small way. 

**tl;dr** Well, now for the big question. Should I try to apply for grad school next fall? Should I try to go back to college for CS this fall? (It is probably too late?) Is there such a thing as ""safety school"" when it comes to graduate school in computer science?

I am currently a second year student studying at Michigan Technological University and I major in Computer Science. The major has been great it itself and I have loved the small nuances that make it so much more different to anything I had previously done in highschool and other learning environments. However, this post isn't about all of this so I will start to cut to the chase.


Michigan Tech is a very small school in comparison to many others and it has a lot to offer in different areas. Unfortunately, because of their small sort of state they are unable to offer as many opportunities as many other colleges would be willing to offer to their students. It isn't just about money, but the gist of it all is that where I am at doesn't seem to get as many looks by big companies as those other universities out there and I wonder if I should be moving schools and trying to transfer because of the combination of these two reasons.


I realize that in the field of CS a lot of everything has to do with your ability to code (duh). But would a better college be worth transferring for? Would dropping scholarship money to go to a better institution be a good move? I think that I would very much like the idea of leaving this place and never coming back, but I also need to be realistic and consider what I am getting for what I am giving. So anyway, what do you guys think? Does transferring from MTU to another school (U of Michigan or U of Washington) sound like a solid plan or a bad one waiting to happen?

 

Anyway thanks for reading everyone. I really appreciate it. 



Summary:  Should I try to transfer to an above average school I might like just purely based off the idea that there might be more opportunity to explore and get me out of a place that I do not like? Or is sucking it up for 3 more years and building a somewhat of a good resume off of what the school gives me the best plan of action? Should I be worried when no one has ever heard of my school and big companies do not even have us on their radar, or should I just deal with whatever MTU can give to us and work experience is just work experience to everyone in the industry.

/r/AskComputerScience, how would your perfect Data Science undergraduate degree look like?
I have my own purpose for asking this question but that is probably besides the point here. I'm hoping for an interesting discussion and brain storming session about the merits of such a degree.
To start it off, Data Science is not the best of names. To some it probably sounds like yet another hyped buzzword. Instead of going into this discussion, let me refer you to the many discussions of this elsewhere. Of course, there's a lot of variation in the use of the term.

I think we can all agree that the cornerstones of such a degree would be math and computer science. Besides a small core in each area (e.g. covering calculus/lin alg/disc. math/algorithms etc.), what would be need to have and what would be nice to have?

My own suggestion would be to focus the comp sci courses in the areas of data mining, distributed systems, data bases and computer simulations. In math, probability and statistics and numerical methods would be relevant.

I/O devices(monitor&amp;keyboard) connected to device controllers. Device controllers have a local register and buffer. A bus connects them to the CPU. CPU contains RAM and registers. Input in form of Interrupt signal travels from device (lets say a keyboard) to device controller. The device controller uses the registers to translate the signals into code (assembly code?). The data (which is part of a thread, which is a small segment of a process) in register is loaded into local buffer? A user application request a system call to read input form keyboard. Kernel responds to system call by making a kernel thread. Kernel thread uses a register in the cpu to load the info from the device buffer. Kernel thread has directions for writing to file and writes this info to a nonvolatile memory. Kernel thread responds with some kind of signal saying it's completed a task. Signal makes its way back to device device controller's buffer, then registers, then electrical signal that ends up as a blinking cursor on my screen.

I am currently doing some tests on the use of a Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing and (hopefully) Lenstra's Algorithm for solving the Bin Packing Problem against the First-Fit Decreasing Algorithm.

Some background in the BPP if you want to know what I'm talking about: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem it is NP-hard, NPO, it has none approximation scheme, but it does have an assymptotic approximation scheme.

The thing is there is a boundary for the output given by the FFD algorithm in the worst-case scenario: 11/9*Opt(a) + 4. But this is a worst-case boundary and apparently my solutions don't usually perform much better than the FFD, even when using Lenstra's Algorithm which is precise (and useful in some particular cases). So my question is... Is there any literature on the ""expected"" outcome, or even the ""probability of being optimal"" of an algorithm?

In my work it seems that when there are not many articles and they are not ""pathologic"" (some very small, some very big), FFD tends to give the best solution around 80% of times, but I can't really find a way to prove something like that, I don't even know where to begin with!!

I read somewhere that some people believe that P vs NP is an undecidable question (I know you guys probably get P vs NP questions all the time, sorry), but how can that be?

Suppose I have two complexity classes A and B where A⊆B and I know at least a B-complete problem.

If someone proves that A vs. B is undecidable, that would imply that we could never find a way to solve a B-complete problem in A (as that would prove that A=B).

If there's no way to solve a B-complete problem in A, then A≠B.

Therefore, if A vs B is undecidable, A≠B (which is a contradiction).

I'm an Information Technology major but I've always been really interested in how operating systems work and software in general. I'm no computer scientist so you'll have to forgive my naivete on the subject. 

Note: This is not intended to start a microkernel versus monolithic kernel debate

I've heard arguments on both ends about microkernels versus monolithic kernels. The most convincing argument I've heard is that one large program becomes increasingly hard to maintain as more code is added to it. So why not use an operating without a kernel? Why not break up all of the functionality of the operating system into many small components? Won't it be easier to maintain in the long run and arguably more scalable?

Let's say this hypothetical OS is made up of a few programs that are organized into groups. The ""core"" group of programs provides very basic functionality. In order to have something workable you'd need to build upon core.

Core includes the following:

* Procserv: Process scheduling, IRQ, DMA

* Janitor: Memory management garbage collection

* Auth: Various authentication services including security for IPC

* Bus: Provides basic functionality for the implementation of a bus like USB or PCI

* Dep: Manages program dependencies

Now we have the core groups of programs running so that we can build up our OS to be something decent and workable. Lets say we want to implement USB. Could a ""USB"" program be written that inherits the functionality that's already available via ""bus""? I'm thinking about inheritance like what you get in object-oriented programming languages. 

Would this kind of system even be possible and if so what would be the pros and cons?

I am in my final year of high school and wish to pursue a degree and career in computer science, but I have recently become conflicted in choosing between CS and Software Engineering. I am looking for some advice about both fields and the differences between them. I have read the basic differences of software engineering and this is what I've got so far: CS is more focused on the theory and math of computer science, while software engineering is focused of on the design of software. I find I am confused by this and don't really understand the difference. Wouldn't one need to understand math and theory to design a program and vise versa. From this I have to think there is lot of overlap, but my university that I intend to go to has separate programs and seem to have many different classes.

* So what I am looking for is a good comparison of CS and SE and what really matters. Some other stuff I would like to know include:

* are CS and SE degrees transferable when going into a masters program

* what is the difference of jobs each can do and what has more earning potential (I don't like the idea of doing a job just for the money , but the two are similar enough that I'd take what's higher if significant)

* what degree is typically harder (i don't think this will matter, I am fairly smart: I am taking an intro CS while in grade 12 and have good gpa, etc. but IDK)

* What degree is held with higher regards to employers

* any other insights that you think would be helpful

In this class, an emulator is software that duplicates (or emulates) the functions of a first computer system (the guest) in a different second computer system (the host), so that the emulated behavior exactly replicates the behavior of the guest.


You are to design and write an emulator for state-table defined finite state automata using breadth-first tracing semantics. There are two inputs: the program written as a state-table and a line of printable ASCII characters that represent input strings.

INPUT STRINGS. An input string is a single line to standard input that is terminated by a new line. Only printable characters are allowed; unprintable characters are treated as a newline character. Reserve the poundrel ('#') for the empty string.

STATE TABLES. The input programs are written using the five column notation we used from the beginning, with the columns separated by tabs. State tables will also be read from STDIN.

CONTROL LINES. There are three control lines: %BP, %EP, %ES. The beginning of a table is a line with just %BP on it. This is followed by the table; the table is terminated with %EP. The test strings for this program follow; the test is terminated by %ET. Call the lines between %BP and %ET a packet; an input can contain more than one packet.

Nor do I have a sufficient background in logic to fully appreciate the Curry-Howard correspondence.

 * A random programming exercise in [The Haskell School Of Expression](http://plucky.cs.yale.edu/soe/index.htm) - in which Hudak notes an interesting correspondence between the S and K combinators, and various ""lifting"" operations.

My main goal was investigate alternatives to try/catch style of handling errors, which Go decided to not adopt. So I consolidated my understanding in the following pseudocode:

    function reciprocal_of(n)
        if n == 0 then raise ForbiddenDivisionByZero() with
            recovery return_zero()
                return 0
            end

            recovery return_value(n)
                return n

            recovery recalc_using(v)
                return reciprocal_of(v)
            end
        end

        return 1 / n

    function random_function()
        try
            print reciprocal_of(0)
        except ForbiddenDivisionByZero
            recover recalc_using(3)
        end
    end

    random_function()

Explaining, when `random_function` runs and catches an error, the caller (random_function itself)
has the option of use one of the ""recovery functions"" `reciprocal_of` has prepared or just
handle the error itself (like a regular try/catch). The thing is, if it chooses to recover,
then the execution proceeds where it was stopped (inside the chosen recovery), so ""print""
will be called, in this case, with ""1/3"". So what ""recovery functions"" are doing is something
like frozing the stack at a certain point, and then proceeding it if you want to, without
violate the function contract, which is what regular exceptions like Java or Python does.

The advantages I see are based on the idea that the best place to decide *how* to handle an error
is near the error itself, and the place to decide ""what"" to do are in higher places on stack. A example
I found is when I'm trying some code on a REPL shell. If a wild exception occurs, the REPL
catches it and asks you if you want one of the recoveries or just abort the execution. If you take
a recovery, the execution will proceed normally.

What I want to know is:

 - is my understanding right?
 - How you compare this feature with the current try/catch system and Go error handling?
 - What's the difference of complexity of implement something like that in a programming language?

So anyway, I learned that it was as recently as the 70s that a man name E. F. Codd wrote a paper or two describing a mathematically well-defined model of a relational database, and it made a huge splash and had a big influence on how people keep track of their shit in tables.  The thing is, when I read what exactly makes a relational database a relational database, it seems so intuitive that I'd expect the idea to be old as dirt.

You make a set of tables, all the data you need to keep track of is somewhere in some table, a table and its set of fields are generally analogous to a class of objects and their attributes, one field is just there to uniquely identify each record in the table, and if an object/record has some number of objects/records from another table associated with it you keep track of those relationships as an attribute in that other table.  That way you don't have to make a big stupid sprawling tables-within-tables table to keep track of all your shit.

None of those ideas seem at all revolutionary.  I can't imagine how people keeping records of large amounts of related things could not have already made many databases with all those characteristics.  I would expect them not only to have made them, but to have made generalizations about their design and use.  So what am I missing here?  Am I ignorant of a bunch of other things Codd was explaining in his papers, which would make the papers' significance obvious to me if I knew about them?  Or is it like the difference between the world before a mathematically defined model of relational databases and the world after is so great that I, growing up in the latter, just can't imagine what a shift of thought it was?

My friend has written an algorithm to traverse this  is made up of for loops, the psuedocode is below: 

    root = tree.root();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; root.children_size(); i++)
        child1 = root.child(i);

He claims that because this has 3 for loops, the run time of this algorithm is O(n^3). When I ask him what n is, he said is the number of for loops, which doesn't make sense, because n has to be a structure within this tree. 

I claim n is the number of overall nodes in the tree and the run time of this algorithm is O(n), because the run time will be O(root.children_size + child1.children_size + child2.children_size).

Get a B.S. in computer science(and most likely not graduate in 4 years)

Get a B.A. in Statistic and in turn get an SAS programming certificate(and graduate in 4 years)

How much emphasis do employers put on having a B.S. over a B.A. for Computer Science?

What jobs are even out there for Statistics degrees that say, a Math degree wouldnt be able to attain?

Are there very many jobs where an SAS certification would be all that useful?

But, The Euclidean algorithm determines the GCD of two numbers a and b in O(log^3 (a)) time where a is the larger of the two numbers. Now, for any composite number N, it must have a proper divisor less than or equal to sqrt(n). So, if we want to factor N, can't we just apply the Euclidean algorithm on the pair (N, a) for 1&lt;a&lt;=sqrt(N). This either returns prime, or returns the smallest non-trivial proper divisor a. Then we can apply this procedure to N/a requiring at most log(N) repititions. Thus, we can fully determine the prime factorization in O(sqrt(N)*log^4 (N)). But for a positive integer N, sqrt(N)&lt;N and log(N)&lt;N so this algorithm is better than O(N^5 ).

Only there is no way for the scheduler to know the length of the next CPU burst. The CPU scheduler predicts the next CPU burst as an exponential average of the measured lenghts of previous CPU burst. 


How the hell does this make any sense? Let say there are 5 processes in the queue with CPU burst of: p1=4 p2=6 p3=2 p4=10. After the first process, p1, lets say the predicted burst time is 4. How does that help the scheduler know which process to pick next if it doesn't know before hand how long a process will take. What good does predicting the next one do? 

Edit: After read your comments I think I understand. I'll tell you what I've learned, you tell me if I'm right:

A burst is not how long the entire process took but how much time a thread (piece of the the process?) is in the CPU before it is preempted (another processes takes it's place?) and goes to wait in the queue until it can finish. 

If a process has had two burst so far, ta and tb, then the CPU knows the needed processing time for that entire process is at least ta+tb. From these two pieces of information it can extrapolate the total processing time (in the example it used an exponential average) and guess how much time is left. This extrapolation is used to reassign the priority of this process. If there is a different process in the queue with a higher priority, it will enter the CPU at the next time splice and the old process will go back to the queue. 

This prevents an extremely long process from hogging the CPU and allows short processes to move through faster.

Also other things that I'm unsure about at my first job.",latros,4,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/1ess3p/junior_web_developer_in_canada_first_real/,"I got hired as a ""Junior Web Developer"" with a local company in small town Canada at a salary rate of ~$30k before taxes - meaning my take-home pay will likely only be $700-$800 every two weeks.

My question is... Is this right? It seems kind of low to me. I understood that entry level programming positions paid easily ~40k+. 

Is it because I'm in small town (Fredericton, NB) Canada, or am I being jipped? This isn't much more than minimum wage around here. EG: The call center I worked at last year paid about the same as this, and that was a *call center*.

The other ""iffy"" thing about this job so far is what I'm actually *doing* on the job. The above salary is for a job which is described as ""taking a .PSD of a website design and creating it in. HTML / CSS"". So far my job is 30% that, 70% hooking said HTML / CSS to a WordPress backed which is mostly PHP and SQL stuff. I have no issues with that other than the fact that I'm doing work which is a significant step above the job description in terms of complexity (not to mention pain-in-the-ass-ness... cant stand WordPress!). I'm a back-end developer at heart who would rather be coding my own CMS than working with WP!

So is this sort of situation normal for a junior developer (IE: the bitchwork, no *real* programming) or should I be keeping my eye out for other jobs while I work here?

Part of me feels like I'm being jipped and am going way above and beyond the job description for the same (low) salary, and part of me feels like I should suck it up and be grateful that I have an opportunity to get my ""3-5 years experience"" that so many people are trying to get nowadays.

Could we write an algorithm that searches for an algorithm to solve NP problems in polynomial time?,cowgod42,6,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/1dua1f/what_is_the_complexity_of_deciding_whether_pnp/,"I hope the question is clear, and also that I'm not knocking on the door of the Barber of Seville with this question (e.g., perhaps the halting problem will halt this inquiry).  

Let us suppose that an algorithm to solve NP problems in polynomial time exists, but that we do not know what it is.  We want to find this algorithm, say, within our lifetimes, so we write an algorithm to find it.  The algorithm doesn't have to be perfect.  We could, for example, iterate through all C programs smaller than a certain size which input a graph of size N, and output whether the graph contains a Hamiltonian cycle, and test each of these for efficiency.  We would then increase N to see if the efficiency scaled properly, at least for fairly large values of N.  If no algorithm is found, increase the maximum allowed size of the program, and repeat.

An obvious problem with this approach is that the set of ""all possible C programs smaller than a certain size"" is quite large (though it *is* finite), so the iteration may take vastly longer than a human life span.  Of course, we could try a genetic approach or something so we aren't wasting too much time on clearly bad algorithms.

I'll level with you from the start and say this is part of an assignment **BUT(!!!!)** I am not after 'answers', I am after an understanding. I have met with my lecturer/tutor but still am struggling. First I will post the question and then I will post some of my thoughts and calculations. I really hope this is the right place for this!

**The Scenario:**
*On a fictitious computer of 32 bits, paging memory management system is used to manage its 
main memory (physical memory), 1G in size. In this computer, all the main memory can be 
used for user processes (i.e., ignoring the memory requirement for the operating system). A 
program requires an array of 1024 elements, and each element requires 2M memory. To run 
this program, 2G memory space is thus needed for the array:  
2M×1024 = (2×2^20 )×2^10 = 2×2^30 = 2G
For this assignment, we use this measure system:  
1K=2^10=1024 Bytes   
1M=1K×1K=2^10 × 2^10 = 2^20 Bytes, and   
1G=1K×1M= 2^10 ×2^20 = 2^30 Bytes  
Explain how the computer system accommodating the 2G memory requirement by only using 1G physical memory. Assume that the page size is 2M, and so is the page frame size (This extraordinarily big size is chosen to make the calculation easier in this assignment task).  
In your explanation, you should address the following issues. You don’t have to address them in the exact order listed below; so long you address all of them. Proper writing is required.   
After reading your answers to the questions, one should have basic understanding without the 
need of referring to any other sources. Simply using a few keys to answer each question won’t attract any mark.  
1. Explain what logic memory addresses are, what physical memory addresses are, and the 
relationship between them. [1 mark] **Done this part**  
2. What are pages, page frames, page faults, and a page table? [1 mark] **Done this part**  
3. In this computer system, how many bits are used for page numbers, and how many bits are used for the addresses inside of a page? What is the maximum number of pages? (Hint: the sum of the bits used for the page numbers and the bits used for the addresses 
inside of a page should be 32). [1 mark]   
4. What is the minimum number of page faults incurred for the program to access each element of the array at least once? What situation makes the access of an element of the array longest in terms of time, and what situation makes the access of an element of the array shortest in terms of time? [1 mark]  
  
**My Thoughts**  
total physical memory = 2^30  
page size = 2M = 2^21  
  
bits of the logical address space to manage pages=  
(total physical memory) / (page size)  
= 2^30 / 2^21  
= 2^9 = 512 which is how many 2M pages you would create from 1GB correct?  
  
bits used for addresses inside a page  
page size = 2M = 2^21 which means there would be 2^21 storage places (?? not sure what to call this) inside the page. but this this, 2^21 and 2^9 only add up to 30, not 32?  
  
max number of pages = total physical memory / page size  
= 512?  
  
if someone could just point me in the right direction that would be great! haha like i said im not after answers, I just want to know if what i'm doing and how i'm thinking is correct.  

Thanks.

A colleague and I recently had an idea for additional security in one of our web applications that goes beyond username/password. 

Usually with ideas like that someone smarter already figured it out and created an open source project, or the idea is just dumb, so I am looking for pointers and opinions. 

The problem:
We have a web application with sensitive data, which has several hundred users, but at the moment the application is protected with username/password, which is not optimal. It would be really cool to introduce some third variable into the authorization, something that is not easily bypassed, something like google 2-phase authorization. 

The idea:
When a user is registered, they are mailed a link (expires on first use, expires after a certain time) which generates a random public/private key pair. The public key is stored on the server and is paired with the user account, the private key is given to the user. The user saves this key somewhere on their client machine. 
When the user accesses the web application with sensitive data, they must enter their username/password to gain access to the application, but the server encrypts the data sent to the client using the user's public key. For the user to be able to read the data on the client, they must somehow make their private key known to the browser - maybe a lingering popup with a textarea where the private key is pasted and a javascript that decrypts the data on the client, or via a plugin, or some other approach - this is still an open question. 


Of course the user must take care that their private key is secure at their location, but at least you need 2 authentication pieces - the private key AND the username/password. 

What do you think? Is there someone doing something like this already?


EDIT: We already use SSL. Basically username/password security sucks. Imagine the user also has a hotmail account which uses the same username/password combination (because users are lazy) and it gets hacked. The hackers could gain access to the sensitive application very easily. To be really sure of your security you would need another variable - something like TAN numbers that your electronic banking uses to authorize a transaction, or the google authenticator application / 2-phase authentication system - something that is hard to replicate or crack remotely. 


EDIT2: Now that I think about it, it can be much simpler. After username/password challenge, they get a form with a textarea, where they should paste their private key. The form also contains an encrypted token that was generated on the server, which is decrypted using the private key and the resulting decrypted token is then submitted to the server all using javascript. If tokens match user can continue and their session gets flagged as trusted.

Background: Currently a Junior is High School. I have a fascination for computers/software/hardware. Also, gaming. I'm nearing my end of my high school career, and I want to start considering the fields I want to delve into as a profession later in life. I'm stuck between two: Comp Sci, and Graphic Design.

My questions:

&gt;What kind of job can I get with a comp sci degree?

I would like to be able to make (or be part of) the video game industry when I get older. Do the video game companies/the video game industry even hire people with a comp sci degree?

&gt;I read that you must take calculus to understand/take comp sci. Is this true? 

As someone who hasn't even taken Trigonometry, will comp sci be too much of a challenge? 

&gt; What exactly do you learn in Comp Sci? To be more specific, what skills do you learn?

Is it just programming in different languages? Or is there more too it?

&gt;I know this subreddit is aimed particularly at comp sci, but which leaves me with broader options? Comp Sci or Graphic Design? Should I Dual-Major in those 2 since they are my main interests?

Thoughts, comments, constructive critisizm is encouraged, but I really look forward to some in-depth answer to any/all my questions, because I am a person who loves to think and always be armed with a decision. Thank you in advance!

One of the biggest regrets in my life is not majoring in computer science for my undergraduate degree. Having said that I did my part by trying to read up and watch many video courses offered by universities. I absolutely enjoyed working through different algorithms and data structures. But here's the thing, Mathematics is not my strong suit. I often find it difficult to solve the assignment problems given along with the video courses. I can understand all the proofs explained in the class. I was surprised I could follow along with the MIT OCW algo class, given its rigorous nature but I feel awfully incompetent when faced with the assignment problems. I had initially given up on the MIT class but then after taking a CS Math class from aduni.org I was able to follow along, but that's about it. I faced similar difficulties with Theory of computation too, everything explained in class is crystal clear but the proofs I had to work out on my own were a bit beyond me.

Now I am really interested in a career as a programmer and just blindly coding without understanding what is going on under the hood is not my nature. There came a point when I realized that self study alone will not get me where I want to be (Purely my case, might work for others) , this is when I felt an MSCS degree might be something I should look into. And where I want to be is also a fuzzy picture in my mind, I dream of working for companies like Google and Facebook. 

As of now I have an admit for MS-CS from Syracuse. But given how shaky I am with the fundamentals of CS/Mathematics I am apprehensive about taking up this course. Syracuse also provides a MS-CE (Software Track) which is much more industry oriented and going through the coursework I am fairly confident of doing well in that program. But this course is heavily geared towards Microsoft technologies, is that too bad a thing? I dont want to be limited to just Microsoft technologies.
 So my question is what is better, a shitty MSCS degree or a good MS Software Engg degree or does it even matter !?

I'm sophomore attending a community college right now and I've recently decided that I do not really enjoy my current major (Geology). I've been exploring some of my options and CompSci was one of the majors that jumped out at me.

The main thing I want to accomplish here is gain a little big of knowledge about the subject without diving into a full course load.

There is a free [C++ course](http://beginnerscpp.com/) that I found through Reddit that I've been playing around with. So far it has been very informative, but for the most part I'm just copying what the instructor writes and trying to understand it. Is there any sort of simple programs or tools that someone could suggest to maybe try to learn something on my own?

I've read that Compsci requires a good grasp on mathematical concepts. I've always done well in my math courses, but the highest level math I have taken is PreCal. Even though I haven't taken any high level math courses I think my math skills are at least up to par. How important is it to have/develop these skills? Outside of taking more math courses (which I plan on anyway) what can I do to gain these skills?

I got to wondering about how sorting happens at runtime on an aggregator like reddit, or any site where scores are assigned dynamically by usage (which I suppose would theoretically extend even to Google). 

We know that, in reddit's case, the algorithm accepts a number of perameters (date posted, upvotes, downvotes, constant etc) and assigns a score to each post in order to generate the front page at any given time. This got me thinking about how the server load could be kept as low as possible for each query. 

These are some of my thoughts:

- It would be inefficient (if not impossible) to build a system that, on each user's page-load, queryed every submission ever posted to the site, assigned a score, indexed the list of scores, ordered the list and only showed the top 20. 

- Extending that in the opposite direction, would it be possible that none of the score assignment is done on page-load request? Is, for example, the server running the algorithm behind the scenes and constantly over-writing the score field in the submissions table and indexing on each pass? This would makes you question how new content can rise so quickly and also makes you ask how it prioritises content that needs its score updated with much greater frequency (front page content needs to be much more frequently scored and ordered than a subreddit with no new posts for 2 years), so if everything was done behind the scenes how would this prioritisation be calculated?

- Is it a combination of automatic constant background score-updating and running part of the algorithm on page-load? Could, for example, a score be reassigned in the database on each upvote/downvote that used a computed field to calculate exactly the same algorithm but excluding the time factor? You could then have it run the last process of factoring in time on page-load? 

- In a similar vein, would the server perhaps be automatically applying, saving, and indexing a much more basic, quick algorithm score (including time) as a background process which could then be sorted with more fidelity at run-time?

- What is happening when a user upvotes? Does that action trigger a re-calculation? And if the algorithm is so dependent on time, surely constant re-calculation is essential anyway.

From my questions, I'm sure you can see that i'm fumbling gracelessly around a subject that's new to me. If I had better terminology, I promise I'd use it! If any of the ACS community have any knowledge to impart on this subject or know of any literature that could help me understand the concepts better, I would be forever in your debt. :)

Please review the following and provide your feedback, criticism, and correction. My questions:  Does this make sense? Is it correct? Could this or something like it prove P vs. NP?


P?NP#1:  Draft


Let there be two plateaus, several miles apart, where people on one plateau can see people on the other plateau. Each plateau has one path leading down from it. Between and around the plateaus is a great forest with many trails going through it in various ways to different destinations. These trails are hidden by the over-arching forest. Let there be a village atop each plateau.


The village chief from the first plateau calls for one of his men and speaks to him. ""I want you to travel through the forest to the village at the other plateau. You are to be an envoy to establish communication between our villages. You are the third envoy I have sent.  Both of the previous envoys perished on the way to the other village."" The chief pulls out a flag. “When you reach the other village, stand at the edge of the plateau and wave this flag so that I may know you made it.""


The envoy bowed deeply, took the flag from his chief, and departed. Several days or weeks later, he arrived at the other village where he waved his flag. A watchman at the first village saw the signal and relayed the message to the chief, who was glad.



Summary: 
	
That the correct path was found is easily verified.

Finding the correct path was difficult and involved many branches that could not be converted to an easy path.

Therefore there are languages intersecting our physical reality where verifying an act has no relation that makes a difference to the difficulty of accomplishing the act. P ≠ NP.




Q&amp;A with the chief:


Why did you not jump across to the other plateau?

It was too far for anyone to jump. Even with a bow and arrow, it was much, much too far.



Why did you not build a flying machine and fly across?

A flying machine?  Humph. Even if that were possible, the effort to get the resources, the planning and expertise to build such a thing, and the training required to get a man to fly across would be much greater than the task to send men through the forest.



Could you not signal across to the people there?

I wanted to send an envoy, not lights. And what if there were no people there and I wanted to establish an outpost? There is no guarantee the people would understand my signals, and there did not have to be people at all for me to send my men.

",a_baby_coyote,2,0,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/16mbnr/help_with_the_outside_life_aspect_of_getting_a/,"I'm not sure if this is a commonly asked question, but I feel I should ask it so I can work to better shape my future to my goals. 

A little about where I'm at now, I just returned to college after a long break, my degree focus being Computer Science with a focus on math, and it's possible I'll go for a dual major depending on how things pan out. 

I'm a sophomore with credits, and currently use a 40 hour a week job to pay for my school with tuition reimbursement. Not having to pay a cent towards my undergrad education is a nice benefit but as you can imagine it may not be my best option. 

My current goal is to finish my undergrad in as little time as possible given my circumstances (40 hour a week job), which may be 3 more years minimum. I'm 26 years old and I think due to my makeup more than my age, I'm not someone who can continually sacrifice sleep without paying a heavy penalty for it, so to have enough time to study, decreasing my class load might be necessary. 


So this is a question more about life around schooling rather than specifics into schooling itself. Free education is awesome but I feel I'm at a disadvantage because there's no way I can do an internship which I would think is very important, unless I'm able to convince my work to let me intern a project. There's also limited time to do self education which I really would like to spend time on. 

I hope I'm not being too verbose in getting to the point. I know to go the PhD route, I need to begin focus now on working towards that goal, through study and gaining knowledge as much as I can outside of school. 

So how does a 26 year old that can't live at home, and is entirely dependent upon a full time job, pursue a PhD? Is this a path only suited for the really young/go getters that never missed a beat with education, or is strong determination a little later in life enough? 

You don't even really have to answer my specific question, this can just be a discussion about living the PhD life. ",,False,,t5_2shke,False,,,True,t3_16mbnr,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/16mbnr/help_with_the_outside_life_aspect_of_getting_a/,

&gt;I'll try to elaborate my questions and my current ""understanding"" of the topic.
&gt;
&gt;-----
&gt;
&gt;1/ What is net neutrality? Who is it geared towards (ISP or Cable providers)? Whose/what actions does it mandate? What is expected to happen with, rather than without, network neutrality and vice versa?
&gt;
&gt;From what I know, net neutrality proponents advocate for governmental control over the Internet Service Providers (ISP) so that they cannot do a number of things. E.g. they cannot discriminate content providers, restricting the user's connectivity to competing services (YouTube, Amazon, Netflix for example if the ISP is also a media distributor with conflicted interests like Comcast).
&gt;
&gt;What is confusing here is the distinction between the ISPs and the cable providers. According to Wikipedia, there are currently 5 major cable companies in the US, and I imagine that they lease their physical network of tubes to ISPs who, in turn, allow and manage our use of those tubes.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; As an analogy, cable providers build the road networks, ISPs rent a part of those networks, distribute to users and regulate the traffic (DNS resolution, for example).
&gt;
&gt;-----
&gt;
&gt;2/ How does net bias hamper innovation?
&gt;
&gt;I imagine it has to do with [something like this](http://isen.com/blog/uploaded_images/5z6vt4n-720249.jpg). On the other side of the coin, content providers might have to pay a premium just for the privilege of being connected to, thus innovative start-ups who can't pay this premium cannot get off the ground.
&gt;
&gt;What isn't 100% clear is how this is different from our currently existing tiered internet service. People and companies **are** paying more for higher quality service. Whether the bandwidth scarcity is artificial or real, it is a matter of fact that the internet has been and is still working like that.
&gt;
&gt;One key difference that I can find is that our current mode of discrimination only concerns the quantity, not the quality/content, of the traffic. That said, tech startups are already paying more for better service, this argument will fly only if the premium for ""being connected to at all"" is significant.
&gt;
&gt;-----
&gt;
&gt;3/ Regarding the ""privacy concern"", how does it make sense?
&gt;
&gt;Wikipedia writes the following:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Some opponents of net neutrality legislation point to concerns of privacy rights that could come about as a result, how those infringements of privacy can be exploited. While some believe it is hyperbole to suggest that ISPs will just transparently monitor transmitted content, or that ISPs will have to alter their content, there is the concern that ISPs may have profit motives to analyze what their subscribers are viewing, and be able to use such information to their financial advantage. For example, an ISP may be able to essentially replicate the ""targeting"" that has already been employed by companies like Google. To critics such as David Clark, a senior research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the proper question is ""who has the right to observe everything you do""?
&gt;
&gt;How does Net neutrality license ISPs to monitor our traffic?

Presume that you're running in something very much like the JRE, with an absolute memory limit, and a system-level component that is in a good position to have deep knowledge of your object structure. Now say that there's a good way to tag that an individual class is entirely derived from data that can be contained elsewhere (perhaps a configuration class that could, if need be, just read the config file again).

What if the system could notice that it was running low on memory and remove one or more of these ""derived classes"" (pardon my misuse of an existing term). Attempting to access these classes would prompt the system to re-create them on the fly.

Presuming that there are at least a moderate number of these classes (which may be a bad assumption, maybe that's why it never happened?), it seems like you may be able to have the system automatically juggle classes around even in the absence of virtual memory.

I realize that since pretty much everything has virtual memory these days that's a much more practical solution in modern times.

First of all, I know I'm reinventing the wheel but I have some game ideas I want to explore and you can't build a very good car if you don't understand how the tires work.

That being said, high school math was a long, long time ago.  I have a basic 3D camera codebase that I'm working with but it's (intentionally) a very minimal design.  I've been trying to answer my own questions with Wiki/ wolfram/ pen+ paper but most everything uses symbols I don't recognize and might as well be a foreign language.  Those of you who can do geometry in your sleep, please help me grok this.

Here's how I understand about the problem.  I apologise if I misuse symbols, I'm just a coder who pretends to understand set theory.

* *W* is the set of all points objects could exist in, aka the game world.

* Object *O* exists in *W*.  For simplicity sake, it's just a point at O(x, y, z)

* The camera *C* is a point that exists in *W*.  In addition to C(x, y, z) it also has a rotation *Crot*.

* The view *V* is a set of points in *W* that begin at point *C* and extends in both directions like a triangle (or more likely like a trapezoid.)

..and that's where things start to get fuzzy for me.  In geek-layman terms, how do I figure out where the start/ end values for *V* are in relationship to the original, non-rotated coordinates of *W* when viewed from *C*?

After a year of looking for full time work in film, doing freelance gigs, and personal projects I realized I love making films but I don't love to do it professionally. So, now I'm looking to focus on bridging CompSci and Film making. I feel like my best course of action to get started in this is Grad school as I only have a basic understanding (mostly by using current tools) of the concepts used in image manipulation, video compositing, object tracking, camera solving, video compression, computer vision, etc...

Most of my undergrad time was very disproportionately spent on film related projects and as a result my experience in the CS department was limited to taking the classes I needed to graduate and not taking my grades too seriously. My GPA is above (but not by much) the min requirements for applying to UWM's grad program but I was told it would be in my best interest to take a few grad level courses first and build a solid GPA while giving myself time to research school and build a solid application. So I decided to enroll at UWM and take a few classes this Fall.

UWM has very few courses in computer graphics and the vast majority of the research directly tied medical applications. Yes, there is overlap I'm much more interested in using computer graphics for the arts. I was wondering if anybody can recommend any schools that had decent amount of research going into computer graphics related topics that don't focus on medical applications? Also, if anybody can recommend any books, websites, forums, open source projects, or companies I research, or just general advice I'd love it hear it.

Will innovation continue to be driven by new languages or are all the languages we currently have basically ""good enough"" for our purposes?


Okay, so here's why I'm asking: I'm really fascinated by programming languages and spend quite a bit of my time thinking about them.  I designed a pretty small scripting language a few months ago; the language works and it was a really cool side project and I learned a lot making it, but the syntax is pretty shitty and there are (obviously) no libraries and the language doesn't really bring that much that's actually *new* to the table, so nobody would ever actually use it. (Hell, *I* don't use it).

But I keep thinking about languages and I keep having ideas. You know, ""programming would be easier if..."" and ""you could get really good parallel speedup if..."" kind of ideas.  It's really tempting to get back into the fold and try my hand at making another language (once more, with feeling), but realistically I know it's not practical.

So I'm just thinking about this in broader terms: what does Reddit think?  Do we even need new languages?

Some ideas that I thought might be cool but not totally sure if there are things out there already are as followed:

-IRCs with multiple servers. So basically, the client sends data to multiple different servers and then the servers send the data to another client. This would insure that if one server is down, the message still gets sent because there are multiple servers handling the job.

-P2P mobile file sharing. Just something I thought would be cool to try out. I'm pretty sure there are things out there like this though.

Last week I registered at my local community college for what they call a transfer degree. They say it's for Computer Science and that the local university will accept it and some other college jargon I'm not totally familiar with. I'm going for my bachelors and eventually the masters (all that I read says that's really the best shot to make myself stand out above the rest.) After 4 years of thought and self study (to insure I was truly interested in this field and not maybe just a programming job) I decided to jump in with both feet.

Now, I'm wondering if I'm making the right decision as far as taking community college courses for this transfer degree. I've never attended college or really any kind of school since highschool. Am I setting myself up for failure i.e. when I get to the university am I gonna just be floored by what I was expected to know after 2 years of school already? Should I just start with the university? I've looked at the classes for both and at the university some of the spring classes are data structures and calculus. At the community college I believe the math classes aren't even at college level (anything under 100 isn't college level right?) and there aren't any classes really standing out to me as obviously being related to anything programming related. Not even an introduction to Python course that I saw. It seems like what I'd learn at the first 2 years at the university is totally above what I'd learn at the community college in the 2 years I spent there getting this transfer degree. I'm just looking for advice from someone else that's been to college or is currently enrolled and maybe a crash course in how you decided to approach the entire situation.

They use cubic splines to do bezier interpolation between sample points of the user's drawing. This is pretty straightforward, and there's plenty of algorithms online explaining how to guess bezier control points if you are only given points on the curve. [This](http://www.antigrain.com/research/bezier_interpolation/index.html) is a simple solution for example.

What I'm not understanding is how they manage to do it in real time. From their code snippets they appear to be drawing each bezier curve one at a time as opposed to waiting for the user to finish drawing the entire curve and then using that to find the control points. If I'm understanding correctly, in order to ensure a nonjagged bezier curve, the control points of any 2 adjacent segments must form a straight line. However, since they are doing this in real time, there's no way to guess where the user is going to draw next part of the curve. How do they guess the control points with accuracy? 

Only way I can think of is to simply, arbitrarily pick a control point, then for the next segment of the curve, use a new control point on the same line as the old one and then arbitrarily pick the next one.

The closest thing I can see is that there are 2n ways to assign jobs to processors. So you can think of one processor as being items in a subset, and the other processor as items not in that subset, with the union being the entire set. The trick then is to pick the right numbers such that when you run the load balancing algorithm you get jobs that correspond to numbers in the subset sum in one processor and the jobs that correspond to items not in it in the other processor.

I'm trying to understand a program used my a lecturer to model two threads accessing the same linked list of data.  The linked list is meant to model a simple process queue.  In both these threads, there is a condition that checks if(readyHead==NULL).  I don't understand how readyHead could equal NULL at all.  The program produces different output each time, sometimes very screwed up linkedlist ordering (due to some issues with the concurrent access), and on some rare occasions with readyHead==NULL (I added a line to output when this happened).

Since both threads have their own copies of PCB* p, the values of p from one thread to another shouldn't cause problems in the values of readyHead.  Though, in order for the specified output line (for when readyHead=NULL) to appear, it means that the if(readyHead!=NULL) starting condition would have to be satisfied, and somewhere in the lines 38-40 and 69-71 readyHead would have to get screwed up.

My understanding of the list is that it will initially be like so (organized by pid):

100-99-98...1-NULL, then 99-98-97...1-100-NULL, with readyHead being the first, and readyTail being the last before NULL.  Could someone shed some light on why readyHead would be corrupted into becoming NULL?

The code is here: http://pastebin.com/ENuWWSgX

I was hoping you could help me figure out which are the main classes for a UML Class Diagram from this requirements specification, and why:

""The eDepot system is designed to manage a collection of HGV (Heavy Goods Vehicle) depots for a haulage company. Associated with each depot is a collection of vehicles and drivers and a depot manager is responsible for organising a work schedule between them.

There are two types of vehicle, trucks and tankers which share some common attributes such as vehicle make, model, weight, registration no &amp; service history. Some attributes are however unique to one of the two types of vehicle such as trucks having a max cargo capacity vs. tankers having a max liquid capacity and type (i.e. chemicals, oils, foodstuffs).

All users of the system have a username and password which they use when logging on to gain access to their work schedule and in the case of depot managers, organise a work schedule between vehicles and drivers which are assigned to that specific depot.

A depot manager may assign themselves a work schedule and are thusly drivers themselves. When a depot manager assigns a work schedule, the eDepot system records which vehicles and drivers are required along with the client’s name and the job start and end date and time. The drivers in question are also informed that an update to their work schedule has been made.

A work schedule initially exists in a pending state with the job start date and time being no less than 48 hours in advance and with a maximum duration of 72 hours. Once the job start date has been passed the work schedule switches to an active state and once the job end date has been passed the work schedule is archived.

From time to time it may be necessary to re-assign a vehicle to another depot. This operation can only be made if the vehicle in question has no currently active or pending work schedule.""

I'm thinking it is: ""Depot"", ""Schedule"", ""Vehicles"", and ""Jobs"", but I'm really not sure.

He downloaded visual boy advance, but unfortunately some malware was packaged with it that caused his computer to BSOD a lot, so he used his HP recovery partition to revert to factory state.  

Now, none of his web browsers can connect to the internet.  IE, Chrome, Firefox.  He was briefly able to connect to do some homework, but they are completely busted now.  

The weird thing is, the computer is clearly connected to the wireless network with internet access.  I can see the other machines on the subnet, nslookup and ping both produce expected results, everything in ipconfig looks fine, and literally every single application on the computer can connect to the internet just fine.  

Windows is updating, norton is updating, everybody is talking to the interent except the web browsers.  I even tried typing my router's address and 127.0.0.1, and it still blocks.  All 3 different browsers give na error.  I recall chrome gave error code 138.  

I don't see any naughty processes, unless they are hidden, and I tried disabling all the bloatware startup services like norton and all that shit.  

The only thing I can think of is that either HP has some retarded bloatware on the recovery partition that is blocking him, or the malware infected his recovery partition, and wrote itself into the image.  Or rather, wrote a different piece of malware, as he didn't have this problem before the reinstall from the recovery partition.

Furthermore, it seems weird to me for someone to write malware that specifically targets HP's recovery partition and does this weird thing with the browsers so that you can't do anything, which makes its presence really obvious.  If it is malware, it seems like its only purpose is just to be an asshole.    

I don't know what else to do at this point other than hardcore googling, or just saying fuck it and reinstalling using my copy of win 7 so that I know everything is legit.

Please!,ListenAndLearnPlease,1,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/v7flk/help_with_japplet_program_please/,"I have been doing well in my course until this assignment. I do not understand the textbook's explanation JApplet and appletviewer though, and have suddenly begun to struggle. Help would be greatly appreciated!

This is the assignment:

The purpose of this assignment is to create a Java applet that uses the graphic APIs to draw a pie chart. This problem is based on a problem from Java Programming by Joyce Farrell. The applet will accept four dollar amounts. Each dollar amount represents an investment with a different amount of risk. These categories are no risk, low risk, medium risk, and high risk. Display a pie chart representing the amounts invested by risk category when the user hits the enter key from the last risk category. The initial user interface is displayed below.

The detailed requirements are listed below.

Create a header for the applet. You may use the same one displayed above - Investment Analysis. This header must use a different font and a different point size from the rest of your text components. Place appropriate directions in the applet window to inform the user what he/she must do to use the applet. Make sure each JTextField object for data entry has a descriptive label immediately to its left.
Each ""slice"" of the pie chart must be a different color. Make sure that all the pieces of the pie add up to a full pie (100% or 360 degrees of the circle). There should be no gaps between the pieces of the pie. You can determine the size of each piece of the pie by dividing the respective amount invested by the total amount invested. For example, $100 is invested in the high risk (red) category, $200 in the medium risk (green) category, $300 in the low risk (yellow) category, and $400 in the no risk (blue) category for the chart above. The high risk piece of the pie can be calculated as 100 divided by (100 + 200 + 300 + 400) or 100 / 1000 or 10%. Therefore the high risk (red) piece of the pie is 10% of the total pie.
Add a legend to the chart that identifies which color represents each of the four risk categories. One way to do this is to have the color of the descriptive label and the color of the dollar amount match the color of the pie slice it represents. This is the method used above. You may also have a separate legend in the applet window that has four rectangles. Each rectangle would be filled with a color from the pie chart. Add a label for each rectangle indicating whether the color it displays is for no risk, low risk, medium risk, or high risk. Your legend must make use of different colors as in these examples.
The height and width parameters of the html APPLET tag ""fix"" the size of applet. Use the FlowLayout to automatically position the Swing components. With these in place, hard code the placement of the pie chart so that it doesn't overlap the Swing components. (The advanced Java class shows you a better way to prevent the Swing components and the graphics from overlapping.)
Test your applet with a variety of dollar amounts for the various risk categories. The user must be able to enter dollars (integers). There is no need to enter cents. Make sure your applet and graph still displays appropriately after the window is minimized and then restored.
Do not display the legend or any part of the pie chart before the user hits the enter key from the fourth JTextField object the first time.
You may want to use an array to manage the 4 JTextfield components and the 4 JLabel components for the dollar amounts. However using an array is not required.
Include the html for the applet tag as a comment in your source code. This html will be graded as part of the assignment. It also allows me make sure the Swing components and the pie chart don't overlap.",,False,,t5_2shke,False,,,True,t3_v7flk,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/v7flk/help_with_japplet_program_please/,

The problem is related to pattern recognition:

We are given the center point in 3-dimensional (x, y, z) space of 3 separate class clusters, and our goal is to implement a BP NN to train and classify input samples. The distance between class centers is always greater than 10 (that is;

    // Let Ci and Cj be the center point (For example: Ci.x, Ci.y, Ci.z)    
    // for two separate, unique class clusters.
    float a = Ci.x - Cj.x;
    float b = Ci.y - Cj.y;
    float c = Ci.z - Cj.z;
    // distance is always &gt;= 10
    distance = sqrt( a*a + b*b + c*c );

Given a set of samples (including samples to train), each sample must be classified as either class 1, 2, or 3. I'm confused on a number of different aspects. Should all samples should be processed at once in the NN, or should they be accepted one sample at a time, each with 3 input values corresponding to their respective x, y, z values? Should there be 1 output node determining class 1, 2, 3, OR should there be 3 binary output nodes, each yielding a true/false value for whether or not the sample is class 1, 2, or 3?

How the game works:

1.	A player can play as many times as he/she wants in one session. Each game cost one (1) dollar. 
2.	Player tells program how many games he/she wants to play.
3.	The player enters six (6) numbers from 1 to 40 at the prompt, one number at a time. The program must catch and report duplicate number entry. It must catch and report invalid entries i.e. numbers outside range of 1 – 40.
4.	The program displays the player’s numbers in sorted order.
5.	The program does an instant random drawing. i.e. creates a set of six (6) winning numbers and displays them in sorted order.
6.	The program compares the computer’s numbers to the player’s numbers and reports the payout. 
7.	If the player has additions games to play, repeat steps 3 - 6.
8.	At the end of the player’s session, the program summarizes the player’s transactions. Report Amount wagered, amount won, and net gain. Net gain is the difference between amount won and amount wagered.

Payout matrix:

    Match  0  -  “Sorry, Better luck next time."" 
    Match  1  - ""Congratulations. You won $1.""
    Match  2  - ""Congratulations. You won $5.""

    Match  5 -   ""Congratulations. You won $5,000.""
    Match  6 -   ""Jackpot!!! You won $1 million.""

I do not know if a higher GHz with a dual is better than a lower one with a quad. Will a game like Skyrim or a program like DeepSky utilize the four cores or will it be more beneficial to have a higher CPU speed that usually comes with a dual.

Also, how do I know what I should look for in a video card? There is such a variety in the ratings and I get lost in the terminology. I know it is an important aspect of a gaming computer, but I don't know what values it should have or if it is overkill/held back by the processor.

I studied CS as an undergrad not too long ago (graduated in '08) and I am not a gamer. I learned programming as a teen for fun because I've always been a computer geek. I run Windows, OSX, Ubuntu, Fedora, and openSUSE today on my desktop, laptops, and VMs. 

I have a little brother who is in high school, wants to study CS when he gets to college, and is a gamer (Windows, Wii, NintendoDS). When I told him he should try out Linux since he likes to mess around with computers and wants to study CS in college, he gave me a reply that came off as disgust for Linux (although this is my interpretation since this was over instant messenger). When I asked him what's wrong with Linux, his initial response was that there was ""no game support"" on Linux. So I argued that you can usually figure out how to play any game on Linux (you just need to jump through a couple extra hoops to do it), gave a bunch of examples of major sites and companies that exclusively run Linux, and told him that if he goes into CS, he'll have to use Linux anyway since most CS departments run Linux (at least my school did and most of the schools I looked up). For every argument I made, he responded ""but its Linux!  ಠ_ಠ"" (yes he really does use that emoticon all the time in chats).. 

So to you CS teen and non-teen redditors out there, are teen gamers who play mostly on Windows put off by Linux? If so, is it just a game support thing or is it lack of familiarity? When I asked if he would switch to Macs, he said he would, so is it because it's just not popular in the mainstream? ... and am I right that most CS departments in college teach on Linux, so he'll eventually use it anyway? (At my university's CS department, students could use whatever OS they wanted on their personal computers, but the CS labs and department servers run on Linux. So if there was a project you needed to upload to the server for a class, you had to ssh to the CS servers)",,False,,t5_2shke,False,,,True,t3_rjscr,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/rjscr/is_there_a_stigma_among_todays_teen_gamers/,

Also I will probably  be providing far more information (I hope) than necessary to answer the question, please bear with me.

At work one of my main tasks is to keep track of which pallets of unlabeled cans are being put on the line for labeling and making sure that the tag information is accurate with which cans are on the pallet by checking the product, date and time codes on the can and entering them into a Microsoft Access database. I wish I could provide images but the bosses do not like it when you put your flash drive into company computers and there is no way to access the internet through that computer.

What happens is that I scan the standard barcode that represents the tag number and then it retrieves information from the server which brings up a screen that tells me if the pallet is the correct Ship ID and whether or not there is a hold on that pallet which would prevent us from running it through to be labeled and presents me with little textboxes in which to input data. At this point I need to pull a can from the top, the middle and the bottom of the pallet. At eighteen layers high the pressure on that bottom can makes it hard to pull out, even if you use the tool given your hand and wrist are going to be sore by the end of the day from all the time spent yanking on those middle and bottom cans. Not to mention that despite having 3500-odd cans each, a pallet goes through the line every five minutes so, provided everything is running well. This means if you spend too much time trying to get that out you can get behind rather quickly. 

The thing here is that when these are stacked, layer by layer, the person running the stacker could write down the times for each level with no problem and put them on a sticky note that would get sent with the pallet to the tag writer. No one would have to yank at lodged cans and worry that the entire column will fall down on their foot once they get the bottom one out.

After I get the cans out I have to type in the codes mentioned before. Unless we are labeling for another factory, the code I enter is usually something like this: KDF 1209 1809 and I have to enter three of them for each pallet. Then I click an ""Accept"" button and all of this information gets sent to the server and the list of pallets run for this day is visible in Access. 

So here, finally, comes the question. Would it be possible to make a QR coding program that would contain:

1) What product it is
2) What day it was made
3) What time it was made

in a way that when scanned later, all of that information could be automatically added into the form I fill out? I figure the pull of information from the server would work the same but changing all of the code in the program from barcode to QR code would take the work of a professional, especially if we wanted it to fill out forms properly. 

I know this is not really the subreddit for it but if anyone could give an estimate of how much getting this to work would cost it would be appreciated. I am trying to convince the bosses that this will be cheaper and easier in the long run than dealing with a bunch of employees with carpal tunnel who keep falling behind.",,False,,t5_2shke,False,,,True,t3_nezau,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/nezau/how_feasible_is_mixing_qr_code_reading_and/,

We are building a couple of websites at our university and now need to consolidate the user databases. We thought of using SSO but don't really know which technology is best practice. We're looking at oauth for authorisation, but how do we authenticate? We thought of OpenID, but isn't it overkill just for authentication and it looks pretty complicated for a ""normal"" user. There must be something out there that just provides the ""login &amp; registration"" box?

The websites we are building are going to provide scientists all over the world with datasets and research functionality so there needs to be very little overhead in user registration and login. All websites are independent and built using a mix of technologies, so using a central MySQL db doesn't seem like a good idea - imagine it like googles palette of web services and their single login for everything.

We usually work with the LAMP stack so the SSO service would be running on that.


I hope there's enough info, otherwise please ask.

I am also considering staying in my phD program and just doing research in an area of Physics that uses lots of programming, such as computational materials science or astrophysics, as opposed to string theory.




I have read a few of Paul Graham's essays, and I think starting a startup would suit me well because I am willing to take the risks involved in it and work the long hours to have a chance at winning the LOTTERY, as opposed to taking a low-stress, comfortable good-paying job working in a cubicle. The main problems at the moment are that I have poor programming skills and that I have no friends that are interested in programming or in a startup. But I have been considering joining a club on campus with other grad students that are interested in forming a startup  





I only took one CS class in my undergrad, which was an intro to C++ course, a few years ago. I am by no means computer-savvy. OI know essentially nothing about other programming languages besides C++. But I did use C++ extensively in one of my undergrad physics research projects. I generated simulations of a simple physics process. Given that my only prior programming experience was taking one intro CS course, I struggled mightily with the project. My program consisted of only basic if, for loops, etc. Nothing complicated and no object-oriented programming. Though I did find it challenging and fun to write the project, I also ran into lots of frustrations. In the end, I was able to get the program to do was it was supposed to, but it probably wasn't the best program. I understand that running into unexpected problems with unknown solutions is a part of research projects, but I'm sure if I had better programming skills I could've done things ALOT more efficiently.





That being said, how good does one's programming skills need to be to run a startup? I'm pretty sure that I would like programming for solving physical/engineering problems. The question is just whether I would like writing software enough to dramatically improve, say, online dating sites.

where the goal is to calculate the median after numbers are added and removed from a list.
but my solution gets timed out for really big inputs.
I have been trying by maintaining two sets of heap (min and max). Every time I add a number I add it to one of the heaps and balance the heaps so that the number of elements in each heap do not exceed by one. To calculate the median, I either take the top element of the heap with greater number of elements or take the average of the tops of both heaps if the number of elements are equal. 
While there is another way to approach this problem using balanced binary search trees I believe that my solution should have passed the tests. Is there any way I can optimise this C++ solution to run faster?
